      "reviewBody": "Social attitudes were changing in the late 60&apos;s and the film history attributed to these changes. A notorious attribution from the German cinema are the so-called &quot;Lümmel films&quot; (6 in total) in which the young students and other youths dissociate themselves from the older generation. But as this series was made as comedy within the mainstream German cinema, its rebellion is toned down to say the least and no more than a standard farce is the outcome.\n\nIn this episode there are some remarks made by the students to their teachers about the Nazi-past of some of them, Vaterland, military discipline and such, but on the whole the film is no more than a series of the usual adolescent, cheap and boring jokes and the usual petty love affair. The script is  just acceptable with only a hint of story; in fact it is no more than a series of events, wearisome held together by director Werner Jacobs who directs in his well-known &quot;as long as it is on the celluloid&quot; style.\n\nGreat comedian Theo Lingen was a regular in the series and brings with him his charm, but can not provide anything else. Georg Thomalla keeps himself in check and watch how charming he can be when he does so. The rest of the cast is nondescript, but I love Hannelore Elsner in her white-lace corset.\n\nIt must be said that compared to the sequels (and other films prompted by the &quot;Lümmel films&quot;) this episode is not made badly at all - the quality such as there is would deteriorate in the sequels - , but in the end the viewer will agree with the phrase that Hansi Kraus frequently says directly into the camera: &quot;Man fasst es nicht&quot; - It is beyond understanding.",

      "reviewBody": "Gloomy and ponderous are the first words that come to mind when viewing this Warner film directed by Irving Rapper and starring stage star Getrude Lawrence as Amanda Wingfield. While this casting choice gives the film a novel touch, her performance--sometimes strong, sometimes subtle--is not enough to bring the story to vivid life.\n\nInstead, it seems oddly stagebound despite Rapper&apos;s attempt to open it up occasionally. JANE WYMAN seems too old to convincingly portray the girl who is crippled socially and physically, as quiet and sensitive as she is. ARTHUR KENNEDY does well with the role of her restless brother (the sort of character he so often played) and KIRK DOUGLAS seems a rather odd choice to play the girl&apos;s suitor.\n\nSomehow, none of it really jells.\n\nThe viewer is left with the impression that this must have seemed wonderful on the stage (since it was such a well-known hit by Tennessee Williams), but whatever ingredients made it sparkle as a play are sorely missing from the film. In the end, it seems nothing more than an artificial piece and the dialog is never laced with the gossamer effect of poetry that is usually associated with Williams&apos; best works.\n\nThe pace is leisurely and never does the story seem vibrant enough to convince us that the events are really happening. Instead, we have an awareness that Jane Wyman is &quot;acting&quot; the role of Laura and Gertrude Lawrence is doing her best to tone down her stage mannerisms and give a natural performance as Amanda.\n\nSumming up: Not the best of Tennessee&apos;s work on screen.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the few films directed by Italian horror maestro Mario Bava that I hadn&apos;t seen, as well as a film starring my latest object of cinematic lust, Edwige Fenech, 1970&apos;s &quot;Five Dolls for an August Moon&quot; was one that I eagerly popped into my DVD player at home. And it turns out that it was well worth the wait. In this very interesting giallo, a group of businessmen convenes, with their wives, at an ultramodern beach house on what looks to be a lonely Mediterranean island, with the purpose of convincing a scientist to sell them the formula for his new industrial resin. Before long, though, &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; style, the group&apos;s members start to be killed off one by one, and, in a nice, eerie touch, are kept hanging in plastic wrap in the house&apos;s meat locker. The plot here is complex enough without being ultimately impossible to understand or swallow, although one or two points do not withstand logical consideration after the movie is done. Still, Bava&apos;s direction is typically stylish, with some memorable set pieces (dig those bouncing marbles!); a chic, jazzy score by Piero Umiliani aids immeasurably in moving things along (what a terrific soundtrack CD this film could have!); and the picture, though not as graphically violent as, say, Bava&apos;s &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot; (1971), still provides some grisly moments. And Edwige? Well, whether doing a frenzied dance number in gold lame bell-bottoms and matching brassiere or strutting around in various states of undress, this luscious Eurobabe does not disappoint. She is easily the hottest of the &quot;five dolls&quot; here; whotta knockout! My thanks to Image Entertainment for this great-looking DVD of a film never released theatrically here in the U.S.",

The distance between high drama ambitions and more mundane comedy like preferences is classic among performers, and on top of this you have a number of inevitable conflicts between egocentric actors some of which are putting on airs. However we do not laugh out loud over this supposed comedy, in fact there is a great deal of compassion towards these quaint characters apparently living in a world of their own. As in many other cases, the life on stage becomes the important existence for the actors and reality a mere irritating circumstance. The director before making this film aged 46 had himself a past as an actor on tour in the province. The sad box office reality probably was a contributing part to the bankruptcy of the small Novaris film company, but the film is still a modest masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "I previewed this funny, ironic, human, moving movie at the Venice Film Festival 10 days ago.\n\nI would have never even approached the theatre because, up until then, I had a personal loathing of Valerio Mastandrea, the actor in the protagonist&apos;s role. How wrong I was! Mastandrea delivers one of the most refreshing performances I have witnessed in a long time. The whole movie is interpreted by extremely credible actors. The result is impressive.\n\nWhat pushed me to go and see it were the news in one of the Festival&apos;s dailies that, during a previous screening, it had received 23 applauses &quot;open scene&quot;, during the projection - a very rare feat. I did not count the bursts of clapping from the audience during my screening, but the impression was that the number 23 was short of the quantity of exceptionally well crafted hilarious, comic, or ironic moments. Many more moments were worth a thought and special recognition to the scenario, directing and acting in the movie.\n\nI simply could not believe that an Italian movie was so well accepted, and, notwithstanding my personal prejudice towards the main character&apos;s potential, I went with my partner - whose knowledge of the Italian language definitely undermined the chances for her to enjoy the film&apos;s jokes fully - and I saw her laugh just as many times as I did. This movie&apos;s antics obviously transcend the &quot;lost in translation&quot; syndrome.\n\nI was so pleased that it was an Italian movie. Especially in comparison with the otherwise poor to appalling showing of other Italian productions.\n\nTo me, this is a very probable candidate for a Hollywood remake. Unfortunately, I feel it will not be until then that Italians go see and finally enjoy this story. I really do not know why the team who produced it did not enter it into the competition. I definitely think the jury would have regarded it as worth a mention.\n\nRegarding Mastandrea, I feel I must apologize for my trouncing prejudices. His performance is reminiscent of the best moments of a master actor whose art we prematurely lost - Massimo Troisi - but without the Neapolitan connotation which possibly made his genius less understood in the northern part of Italy, or abroad. He moved me and the audience. He made us all laugh with a gesture, a glance, a detail. A laughter never directed at him or the other characters, but with him at the things and situations that anyone would feel they can share - or indeed do share in our not-so-extraordinary lives. He delivered the most credible &quot;prodigal son&quot; figure I have seen on screen, and did it all with a flair and irony which is unfortunately lost in most of the current production - whether Italian or international.\n\nI loved all the bittersweet touches in the movie, from the speed bumps in front of his house, the speed radar in front of the ice cream parlour and its phenomenal use in the movie, up to the suspended ending which leaves every spectator with a free choice in themselves about how this story should end.\n\nMaybe it is too early to call this &quot;genius&quot;, but its simplicity and the directness with which this movie speaks to us is definitely very close to it. I hope that the &quot;serious&quot; critics do not oppose and that this movie can represent a bit of my country, a bit of the life of a &quot;regular guy&apos;s life&quot; of the 21st century in that strange &quot;boot&quot; of a nation, to other Film Festivals, including Academy Awards.\n\nGo see this movie. It is good for your heart. It is good for your outlook on life. Just one day after seeing it, someone stole my PC. Of course I was not pleased, but &quot;Non pensarci&quot; (&quot;Do not think about it&quot;) even provided me with a bit of solace which I sorely needed. Thank you.\n\nPS - A disclaimer: I do not work for the producers, nor have any financial interest in the success of this movie. I just liked it intensely and immensely.",

I wasn&apos;t sure what I was getting into, as there seems to be a rather large glut of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings wannabes crowding theaters now and in the near future. This version of the Golden Compass beautifully brings the books to life and was very pleasing to watch with rather nice visuals. The acting is quite good, especially from the young lead, and the animation makes one wonder what they can&apos;t do with computers these days. The only true complaint I have about this movie is that it is difficult to understand and follow if one is not familiar with the books. Some scenes at the beginning seems disconnected, but after the halfway point the story comes together. The Golden Compass series is rather dark in its nature, and I&apos;m glad that the movie didn&apos;t pull any punches with the supernatural combat (which is awesome, specifically when the witches and bears do battle). Some liberty is taken with the story as expected, and many church references are renamed, but the quality of the story never suffers. I recommend the movie and I look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy completed.",

I expected better from Armand Assante, at least.\n\nOnly one actor in this entire movie enunciated clearly enough for me to understand his lines, but unfortunately we don&apos;t see him until half way through the film.\n\nThat actor was the unforgettable Juergen Prochnow (best known for his role as the U-boat captain in DAS BOOT), as former KGB-chief Andrus Bukarin.\n\nThe plot was thin, the good guys were completely unbelievable as covert operatives, the ending was anti-climactic, and some of the scenes were downright laughable (like the one with the English (or was he an Aussie or a Kiwi?  I couldn&apos;t quite nail the accent) speaking German to a Romanian circus girl).\n\nI suppose this is what I get for being such a Prochnow junkie that I&apos;ll watch almost any movie in which he appears.\n\nAt least Wing Commander had a few good laughs (and overall excellent acting), particularly the send-up of DAS BOOT."

      "name": "Funny surrealism that strikes conventions and fashions",
      "reviewBody": "The systematic analysis of this film would be in my opinion a gigantic task, since there are so many topics, stories and references intermingled in the chaotic way the surrealists are so fond of. I think the two main topics -sometimes in surrealism there is not even one- are dreams and transgression of social norms and traditions. The film is articulated on linked-up situations: five gatherings of a group of bourgeois friends and four stories, four dreams which are dreamt by different characters. The suppers are more common in the first part of the film, and the dreams on a second part, but they alternate with each other and with other episodes, like that of the terrorist girl. At the beginning things seem not to turn out good: right the first thing we see is the perplexity of the guests to M. Senechal house when they are told the supper was planned for the next day. &apos;But that is impossible&apos;, says Acosta, &apos;I couldn&apos;t have accepted, tomorrow I&apos;m busy&apos;. Contradiction with no explanation, right the same way as things happens in a dream, where we accept the reality of what we dream without explanations, even if it is impossible or contradictory with something else -dreams are the core of surrealism and of this film. This baffling beginning really impressed me. There is contradiction and kind of a difficulty to do things in every single detail in the next sequence: Mme and M Senechal are invited to dine out, but she has to change. The restaurant &apos;n&apos;a pas l&apos;air gai&apos;, and the door is locked. They knock and they are invited in. The owners have changed. There is no people and the prices are cheap. Everything is suspicious. And then the first punch of the story: the manager died that afternoon and the wake has been set in the dining room since the undertaker has not yet arrived. Of course, the bourgeois leave. This is the first reference to death, a constant theme either in surrealism, in dreams and in this film. It seems as if the whole film was a dream. Within the context things are logical and normal -or seem logical and normal- to the characters, and their reactions are &apos;contextually&apos; logical too, but from the outside the stories in the film are as odd as any dream we can have. E.g., when Acosta shoots the terrorist girl from his window, or when the army appeared at M. Senechal&apos;s house, or even when the bishop tells M Senechal that he wants to be the family gardener. They are baffled, but they accept the things that happen, as we are baffled by or dreams but accept their logic when we are dreaming. Social transgression is based on a subtle but scorning parody of the bourgeois class and their customs and beliefs. The bourgeois are classy, and conceited: they show off their vain culinary knowledge every time they host a supper. M. Thevenot boasts that &apos;discreet charm&apos; of the bourgeois when he subtly makes fun of the chauffeur: he does not know how to drink a Martini. Later on, Acosta cheats on Thevenot when he tells him that he has to show his wife the &apos;sursiks&apos;. Thevenot does not know what that is, but he is an hypocrite not to say it. The bourgeois are also extremely fond of the lowest vices and they enjoy them gaily -I do not think, on the other side, that Buñuel is condemning them, but the hypocritical attitude of the bourgeoisie. Drug trafficking and consumption, lust, alcohol. The commentaries about the younger girl vomiting and dirty nails and her ignorance (the complex of Euclides, she says at some point) point out -and laugh at- the hypocrisy in the values of the middle-high classes. Also the Church and the Army are criticized. The Bishop, a main head of the Church, is humble -a extremely acid irony- but will mercilessly kill a poor man that will die anyway -that adds to the cruelty. The Bishop is also ignorant: he does not know where the Republic of Miranda is. The soldiers and officers smoke marihuana and praise it, they even are connoisseurs! -&apos;Mexico or Congo?&apos;, the general asks, referring to the origins of the product.. The dreams come over mainly in the second part of the film. Both the two first of them are dreamt by soldiers. I really enjoyed them. In the first one I see a little bit of a reference of the life in Spain on the times when Buñuel was a kid -I do not know Buñuel&apos;s early life in Spain, but I presume there could be some autobiography. The looks of the parents of the young soldier, their clothes and the strict, militarist attitude of the father made me think of the Spanish family life in the turn of the century XIX to XX. I also liked the second dream. The dark and blurry street and house and the background noise make a great dreamy scene. In this dream, the soldier meets a dead friend. Then another friend comes over, and makes him realize that it is impossible. Sometimes in real dreams this happens too. Something happens and then, with no explanation, we realize that is impossible. It also should be pointed out that these two dreams share two primal human topics: motherly feelings and fear to death. The topic of death is present in some other dreams: the general&apos;s, in which Acosta shoots him dead; or the dream about the ghost of the sergeant. Another primal fear is dealt with in Senechal&apos;s dream: shame. They are caught in a theater stage while they are having dinner -this is a recurrent dream that sometimes takes other forms: being naked in the middle of the street or lying on your bed wearing you pajamas in your classroom. I also found humor all over the film: funny situations such as the bishop offering himself as a gardener, or the straws in M. and Mme. Senechal hair. Acosta playing tricks on Thevenot, or the soldiers happily smoking joints and listening to a &apos;sympa&apos; dream. But I do not know if Buñuel is trying to be funny or only to transgress. And that transgression is hilarious because it reveals the hypocrisy of society."

Was &quot;Allegiant&quot; the movie perfect? No. Not by a long shot. It obliterated and basically stripped many of the complex and more interesting layers that brought the characters body and soul in the book. We were left with a very skeletal, fractured and less interesting story. The movie did veer from the original work quite a bit but the substance of the story was still there...it wasn&apos;t lost. We still get the point of what the purpose of the experiment cities were designed for. We get the struggle for power and the fight for humanity to fight for its survival against what seems like insurmountable odds. We get the theme of loyalty and family, ambition and greed vs sacrifice and selflessness. All the elements are there.\n\nWas I annoyed that this movie is part 1 of 2? Not really. I look forward to seeing how the writers and director will adjust the story. Many fans were unhappy with the ending of the book anyway and would like to see it fixed. We&apos;ll have to wait and see if the powers that be stick to Veronica Roth&apos;s vision or create an alternate. But really, there is no need to feel disappointed or distraught. It is after all an adaptation! \n\nTheo James as Four was awesome, though I felt his character wasn&apos;t given much substance in this flick, still he was fun to watch. Bill Skarsgard who played Matthew was a nice surprise. I loved every scene he was in and Miles Teller stole the show as the always self-serving jerk, Peter. We didn&apos;t get much from Zoe Kravitz and Maggie Q was great as Tori. Shailene Woodley was OK. She could only work with what she was given. But the fellas carried this movie from beginning to end. Even Jeff Daniels had his moments.\n\nOverall, I thought it was entertaining. Not perfect but I give it a pass.",

Do these guys even read the comics they decide to make into a show. I am undecided on the shows writing at the moment but I can&apos;t see it keeping me interested that long at all. I would file it under garbage like Marvels Agent Carter and Marvels Agents of Shield. Just money grab programming with no insight into what the comic community really wants. DC&apos;s Flash is really the only thing they have going for them at the moment as Arrow is also complete garbage soap opera bs. So Wonder Woman was turned down for a show but this hot garbage made it??? I am just rambling for the last 2 or 3 lines as this site has some per-designated junk to actually post.",

      "reviewBody": "Having read none of the Lemony Snickett books, I was unsure of what to expect from this film.\n\nThe film begins with a gentle introduction that quickly turns into a humorous, but noteworthy, disclaimer that the following film has dark underlying themes. The main characters are introduced (the three children) and almost instantly we are subjected to the news of the first in a series, or unfortunate events. The film is fast paced and sends the children from one unfortunate situation to another, with Jude Law doing a splendid job of narrating the story along the way. The children a likable and resourceful characters with good chemistry between the actors. You genuinely feel they care about each other and have a great desire to help each other out of these incredible situations.\n\nThe real star of the show of course is Jim Carrey. This film provides the perfect platform for Mr Carrey to do what he does best, goof around and play over the top and outlandish characters. In this role Jim Carrey excels, never goofing off to much to undermine the credibility of the character, but being suitably over the top to convey the eccentric old count.\n\nVisually, the film is stunning, the sets look straight out of a Tim Burton film, the costumes are fantastic, the direction is splendid and does a fine job of progressing the story. The visual effects are tremendous and fit in with the tale perfectly, never distracting nor undermining.\n\nThis film is quite dark for a children&apos;s film, but not dark in a sinister way, but dark in a spooky hallowe&apos;en sort of way that kids love. Watching the film reminded me of reading Rhoal Dahl books as a child, with the over the top characters and out of this world situations.\n\nThe plot of the film is fast paced, but contains good character development and plenty of action and adventure. I would recommend this film to children and adults alike.",

Actually, what I just said made the movie sound simplistic which, despite the prehistoric setting, it&apos;s not. In fact, I was surprisingly enthralled by the story, the acting of Victor Mature and Carole Landis (though Ms. Landis is also good eye candy), the fights of the &quot;dinosaurs&quot; (actually lizards, alligators, and armadillos), and the exciting special effects concerning the volcano eruption. Roy Seawright deserves mega-kudos for that last sequence and possibly for Mature&apos;s fight with what looked like a model dinosaur worthy of Willis O&apos;Brien. Also loved the music score that was played throughout. That score might have broken whatever monotony the slower scenes may have had. So with all that said, I&apos;m recommending One Million B.C. for anyone interested in these old-fashioned effects movies.",

As the Compañia Navarra commanded by Xavier Elorriaga, Walter Vidarte , Chema Muñoz and with tough soldiers as William Layton, Jose Maria Tasso, Patxi Bisquert, Felix Rotaeta, Ramon Barea. All of them proceed a dangerous and hard journey by ship till they arrive in their destination, Albania, where they will find several surprises and a bloody final battle.\n\nHistorical film in medium budget with drama, thrills, and spectacular battles. It is a nice production with fine interpretation but slowly paced. The film was shot on impressive locations and deserts from Bardenas Reales, Navarra, Loarre and Mutruku, Basque Country. The movie packs an atmospheric cinematography by Alfredo Mayo, howewer, being really necessary a perfect remastering because of the film copy is washed-out. Evocative musical score by synthesizer composed by prestigious Alberto Iglesias, who would go on an illustrous career as a great composer, Academy Award included. The picture was professionally directed by Alfonso Ungria, though it results to be some boring, overlong and tiring. Alfonso was a good director who made a few but prestigious films. His movie debut was El hombre oculto 1970, following : Tirarse al monte, Gulliver, Cuentos eroticos, Gatos en el tejado, Hasta luego cocodrilo, Cervantes series, and his best films were Soldados and Africa.\n\nThe film is based on historical events about Compañia Navarra. It was created by Carlos II de Navarra to battle Carlos V de France. After a peace with France, King Carlos II assigns his brother count of Beaumont and also Duke of Torazzo due to his marriage to Juan de Anjou to conquest a far territory. As King Carlos Ii supported Cout of Beaumont to retrieve Durazzo and Albania Kingdom. In 1372 Compañia Navarra enhanced its battalion thanks to the recruitment of 500 Lancemen and archers from Naples. Circa 1375 or 1376 several warriors were drafted from Navarra and travelled Albania. The troops embarked at Tortosa throughout the Mediterranean sea. Later on, Luis and his Great Compañia Navarra took over Durazzo and Albania kingdom. But Luis died and the battalion was jobless until the little army becomes involved under orders of Pedro de Aragon.",

There were plenty of times the film had me laughing out loud with their verbal jabs, but the physical comedy was so overacted, it looked like a silly, low budget comedy. It&apos;s a shame because this cast was fantastic and it should&apos;ve played out a lot better than it did. I gave it 6 stars because it&apos;s still a fun movie and it&apos;s always a pleasure to see stars like Peter O&apos;Toole and Robin Williams mixing it up with other comedic talents, even though this one falls a bit short.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can&apos;t pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage&apos;s initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can&apos;t get enough. \n\n Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes&apos; later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini&apos;s enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!&apos;).  \n\nThis is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed.",

However, the Screenplay isn&apos;t arresting at all times. The first-hour is slow-paced &amp; the unwanted songs bore. Its the second-hour that thrills &amp; engages you. The multiple characters are diverse from one another, but they aren&apos;t always convincing, thanks to the erratic Writing. Robin Bhatt&apos;s Screenplay is quite good in parts, but overall, its flawed. Better Writing was needed! Priyadarshan&apos;s Direction is alright. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is crisp, especially towards the second-hour. Music by Sajid-Wajid is dull.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Ajay Devgn enacts his part with conviction. Anil Kapoor is superb. The veteran portrays his part effortlessly. Zayed Khan is efficient. Boman Irani is earnest, as always. Kangana Ranaut doesn&apos;t work. Sameera Reddy leaves a mark. Mohanlal scores in a brief role. Bhavna Pani is adequate.\n\nOn the whole, &apos;Tezz&apos; does offer entertainment, but in parts.",

Today I met Mrs Paradine for the first time. Strangely enough it doesn&apos;t feel like Hitchcock it feels more like Carol Reed the director who gave her a major International hit with &quot;The Third Man&quot; a couple of years later. I fell in love with Alida Valli in the 1954 Luchino Visconti&apos;s tragic romantic epic &quot;Senso&quot;. Now having seen &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; I see a glimpse of the woman in &quot;Senso&quot; where her actions, are also atrocious but govern by love. A love who will only lead to tragedy. Visconti showed us an Alida Valli that other than a great beauty was also a great actress. Hitchcock introduced her as VALLI in this film, a gimmick with very short legs. Here she plays the widow of a blind man that &quot;allegedly&quot; she killed. The casting of Gregory Peck is a major problem, maybe not for the box office in 1947, but it certainly detrimental to the suspension of disbelief, so needed in a thriller. Charles Laughton is superb in his few, short scenes. I wonder if Hitchcock himself was the inspiration for his role. A judge, a lascivious man with an roving eye for young pretty women. Ethel Barrymore plays his wife, to absolute perfection. Then, Louis Jourdan, beautiful of course, Charles Coburn, Ann Todd but, it is Alida Valli who gives this film that extra something. Considered a &quot;minor&quot; Hitchcock by most but not by me. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is, without the question, the most beautiful movie ever written about the city of Lisbon. It shows on the inside, all the old houses and narrow streets that Portuguese people hold so dearly...\n\n The plot is pretty simple: Phillip Winter (Rüdiger Vogler) is a sound ingeneer for a German director who moved to Lisbon, and he receives a letter from his friend to come to Portugal and help him do this movie about the capital, through sound capturing of all the people, small noises, and even feelings that float in the air. Vogler accepts the challenge, and goes on a trip to Lisbon.\n\nIn the city, he gets acquainted with a local band, Madredeus (who perform a beautiful soundtrack for Lisbon Story), and some of the local kids... After a few weeks, he realizes he&apos;s in love with this town, so full of charm and emotion all over, and the rest I leave for you to see. There is also a bit of romance, between the main actor and Teresa, the lead singer of Madredeus (which is, in fact, a beautiful Portuguese girl).\n\nWim Wenders, as always, has great directing on this one, showing the places that we never thought that would contain so much beauty as they do. He&apos;s a great director, and this is a great picture, in a way of a documentary, but greatly captured.\n\nStrong feelings are expected. Wonderful movie.",

Unfortunately, there is not enough North Africa Campaign in the film to satisfy a war film buff.

The acting is first-rate, and, unlike Enemy at the Gate, the British and American accents don&apos;t detract from the film, the British accents at any rate. As others have noted in their reviews of this film, Rommel probably wasn&apos;t anti-semitic. He deliberately ignored Hitler&apos;s orders to round up Jews during the invasion of France. He also never forgave Hitler for abandoning the Afrika Korps to their fate in 1942, not to Hitler&apos;s less than energetic attempts to keep the DAK supplied.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, &quot;Excursion to the Moon&quot;, by Segundo de Chomón, was included in the three DVD set &quot;Saved From the Flames&quot;--a collection of mostly ephemeral movies that have managed to avoid turning to powder, catching fire or melting--something that usually happened with the nitrate film stock used up through the 1950s.\n\nWhile today this might shock you, back in the early days of cinema, film makers stole each other&apos;s work with abandon. So, if a studio came out with a film, a competitor would often re-film the entire movie once again and slap their name on it! It got so bad, that American Biograph (where D.W. Griffith worked) slapped an &apos;A-B&apos; symbol right onto the sets to prove it was an original! And, in the case of the French genius Georges Méliès, MANY of his films were blatantly ripped off--so many that it makes it hard for film historians to know what is his and what is phony. In the case of &quot;An Excursion to the Moon&quot;, Segundo de Chomón steals Méliès &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; and gives it a very similar title--hoping folks would mistake it for the original! What a jerk! Sometimes imitation is NOT the most sincere sort of flattery!\n\nI&apos;ve seen the original movie about a dozen times and was amazed at just how close a copy this was and no attempt was made to create a new product! There were a few MINOR changes--but that is all (such as the ship landing in the Moon&apos;s mouth and not its eye). As I said, these folks were real jerks and I consider this film an outright theft--as any rational person would! So, technically it&apos;s very nice--but why not just watch the original?!\n\nBy the way, this film was hand-colored using the Pathé-Frères colored stenciling technique. This made it a bit easier than hand-coloring the cells and produced a color that is pretty impressive for the era. However, it was so time-consuming and difficult that portions of films were colored--not the entire product.",

      "reviewBody": "As the previous reviews might suggest, Ab-normal Beauty (2004) is something of a difficult film to pin down; both in terms of its abstract visual style and the actual presentation of the plot. In terms of appearance, the film is a visual labyrinth of warped neon colours, moody lighting and the occasional splash of cold, stark monochrome, all added to further reflect the inner world of the central character; in this instance, a young, misfit photographer becoming obsessed with the notions of sex and death. Further complications are created by the interesting use of narrative; with the film starting out as a kind of sinister art drama with a serious psychological subtext, before eventually changing gears in the second half and becoming an altogether more unusual experience. In this respect, I would draw a natural comparison to two very recent Japanese films, Takashi Miike&apos;s Audition (1999) and Takashi Shimizu&apos;s Marebito (2004); two films that use the conventions and, to some extent, more recognisable iconography of the horror genre, without ever really becoming horror films in the traditional sense. Also, like those two particular examples, Ab-normal Beauty tends to surprise  and perhaps even infuriate?  its viewers with the bold switches in narrative texture and the occasional disregard of logic.\n\nThe first half of the film is slow, subdued, beautifully shot with sporadic moments of surreal violence presented in a distant, dreamlike manner that stresses the characters&apos; disconnection from society. The scenes in which she sets up and photographs various monstrous, decaying objects is masterful; creating a warped sense of beauty that seems as far removed from the horror genre as you could possibly get. As the character continues to stock-pile these images of death and decay - including that first fleeting moment wherein she snaps the aftermath of a car accident, or a tense and thrilling scene in which she documents the suicide of a man from the top of a tall building, one devastating frame at a time - we get hints of something else beginning to take shape that won&apos;t truly become apparent until right at the very end. Until then we must wonder where the film is going; with the first half of the story seeming at times to be more like a biographical drama about a tortured artist losing their grip on reality and the world around them and, as a result, creating their own world in which murder and sex become dangerously inter-twined and beauty can be found within the piles of decapitated chickens and the damp, soaked carcass of a rotting dead bird.\n\nDescribing in more detail the switch in tone and texture that occurs somewhere towards the end of the film might be considered too much of a spoiler, especially given the ideas, mood and atmosphere so skilfully established during these first forty minutes. That said, I don&apos;t think the eventual unravelling of the narrative is quite as random as many of the other reviewers seem to suggest, with a number of scenes, particularly those between Jiney and her sort-of boyfriend Anson foreshadowing many of the elements of power, humiliation, sex and violence that will reoccur during the eventual twist in the tale. It&apos;s fascinating stuff, but again, as with Audition and Marebito, could prove to be somewhat disappointing to anyone expecting a conventional horror film; with the lingering mood of ambient dread and voyeuristic terror conveyed in the more psychological first half recalling some of the more tense moments of Oxide Pang&apos;s earlier co-directed hit, The Eye (2002) - and similar Asian horror films that arrived in the wake of Ju On: The Grudge (2000) and Ringu (19998) - being completely replaced with something much darker, grittier, physical and explicit; tapping into the territory of Eli Roth perhaps, although it&apos;s worth noting that this particular film was released a good year before Roth&apos;s near iconic Hostel (2005).\n\nWhether or not the ending really works is a question for the individual, though I suppose it would be easy to view it as an extended fantasy sequence in keeping with the character&apos;s dark descent into the depths of her own tortured imagination. Regardless, this for me is still a great film; one that creates a mood and an atmosphere perfectly pitched between elements of fantasy and reality, and riddled with images that are bold, striking and completely unforgettable. It is the style of the film and the strange wavering atmosphere in which every character seems to be a potential victim or victor that really pulls us in; enticing us with a story of fear, regret, terror and paranoia, leading us down numerous narrative blind alleyways, convincing us that all is well and that we&apos;ve emerged from the psychological wilderness and then BAM! - they hit us with the hard stuff. Understandably it won&apos;t appeal to everyone; it begins slowly and takes time to pick up the pace and never make a conscious effort to appease conventions of genre or narrative expectations. However, anyone with a fondness for interesting, challenging and edgy world cinema should enjoy the fantastic atmosphere and lingering traces of horror presented to us by this fine piece of work."

I&apos;m a huge Doug Bradley/Pinhead fan, and there will never be anyone to play Pinhead better, but you have to look at what the new guy was up against. Very short shooting schedule and immediate fan ridicule pretty much doomed this poor guy. Overall, I felt he did a decent job with what he was given.\n\nSecond: special effects. Come on people, it&apos;s a direct-to-DVD movie. Are we looking for &apos;Star Wars&apos; visuals here? Honestly, I felt the effects here were a bit better than they should have been.\n\nSeriously, if you&apos;re a fan of this series, leave high expectations at the door and just give it an honest chance.

      "name": "Wong&apos;s signature themes and artistic flourishes are still very much alive, but &apos;The Grandmaster&apos; lacks a focused narrative for a compelling exploration of Ip Man&apos;s life",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Don&apos;t tell me how good your skills are, how brilliant your master is and how profound your school is. Kung fu - two words - one horizontal, one vertical. If you&apos;re wrong, you&apos;ll be left lying down. If you&apos;re right, you&apos;re left standing. And only the ones who are standing have the right to talk.&quot;\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the film began as a biopic of one man – to be more specific, Ip Man, the influential kung-fu master who was instrumental in spreading the Wing Chun style around the world and who was perhaps better known for being Bruce Lee&apos;s master. But in the midst of exploring Ip Man&apos;s life, Wong must have been suddenly struck by the thought - What exactly makes Ip Man so special? Or even better, why should a movie set in the golden age of martial arts be solely about one grandmaster? \n\nAnd so, despite Leung&apos;s omniscient voice-over, &apos;The Grandmaster&apos; is in fact not about Ip Man alone. Be warned therefore, if you are expecting a movie focused on Ip Man, because you&apos;re likely to be sorely disappointed – as Tony Leung reportedly is – that you&apos;re likely to know more about the Man from the Donnie Yen films.\n\nIndeed, the narrative is the film&apos;s biggest handicap, though to be fair, it only becomes apparent later on. The first half-hour begins strongly with a rightful focus on Ip, and key highlights include his initiation into martial arts by his master Chen Heshun (Yuen Woo-Ping) and his loving marriage to Zhang Yongcheng (Song Hye-kyo). Ip&apos;s first challenge would come with the arrival of Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), a venerable kung fu master from northeastern China looking to consolidate his power in the southeast even as he retires.\n\nAfter Ip goes on to win the battle of minds with Gong, the latter&apos;s daughter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) stands up to challenge Ip yet again in a bid to restore her family&apos;s reputation. That duel also marks a turning point for the movie, which shifts away from Ip and explores the vendetta that ensues between Gong Er and her father&apos;s power-hungry protégé Ma San (Zhang Jin) against the backdrop of the Japanese occupation of China.\n\nAgainst the better advice of her elders, she forsakes her betrothal to avenge the death of her father at Ma San&apos;s hands, which culminates in a thrilling battle set at an old railway station in Hong Kong one New Year&apos;s Eve. Where is Ip Man&apos;s involvement in all this? Admittedly there is little.\n\nThough Wong does bring Ip back into the picture towards the end of the film, his audience is likely to have grown too emotionally detached from the character. A scene towards the end that portrays supposedly the last time Ip met Gong Er is infused with the director&apos;s signature sense of longing and regret as the latter reveals her feelings for the former, but how that bears relevance to what Wong is trying to say about Ip or Gong Er&apos;s tumultuous lives is too obscure.\n\nIn fact, throughout the film, Wong offers little insight into the person of Ip Man. What might have been a meaningful portrait of his relationship with Yongcheng is lost when the latter is practically forgotten in the second half of the movie. We learn little too of Ip&apos;s relocation to Hong Kong, and how he built up his reputable school for Wing Chun. All things considered, a more coherent portrait of Gong Er actually emerges from the movie.\n\nRather than regard it as a Ip Man biopic therefore you&apos;ll be better off seeing it as Wong&apos;s philosophical musings on martial artists. Fans of the auteur will recognise these familiar themes from his previous works, but Wong&apos;s treatment is still unparalleled in conveying regret, longing, and unspoken desires – whether is it Ip Man and Gong Er&apos;s mutual affection for each other, or Gong Er&apos;s lament for a life less fully lived.\n\nLe Sourd&apos;s visuals are also particularly ravishing in the action sequences, designed with much imagination and flair by veteran choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping. The opening sequence that sees Ip Man take on a whole gang of men along a rain-soaked street is filmed with utmost clarity on the beauty and precision of the moves, with the subsequent duels between Ip Man and Gong Yutian as well as Gong Er equally breathtaking to behold.\n\nKeenly aware of the actors&apos; limitations, Yuen goes for elegance over spectacle. Nonetheless, both Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi also perform impressively given their lack of a martial arts background, the months of training to get them prepared physically for their respective roles paying off in the grace and confidence by which they execute their moves.\n\nNonetheless, Zhang easily trounces Leung in the film&apos;s dramatic scenes, the former&apos;s combination of grit and vulnerability making Gong Er a more compelling figure than Ip Man. The fault of course isn&apos;t Leung&apos;s alone, as his usual penchant for nuance and understatement unfortunately working against his portrayal in a narrative that pretty much relegates his character&apos;s account as a marker of the passage of time. \n\nOf course, narrative was never a strong suite in Wong&apos;s films, which typically were mood pieces boosted by his signature artistic flourishes. These trademarks are still very much alive in &apos;The Grandmaster&apos;, which is easily one of the most beautiful kung fu movies ever made. But plot plays a much more important role here than in Wong&apos;s other films, since it is ultimately through Ip Man&apos;s experiences in life that we come to understand his deeper introspections. This is where Wong&apos;s film stumbles, relegating Ip Man to a sideshow instead of placing him front and centre – and given all that hype and expectation of Wong&apos;s Ip Man biopic, the cut we see here can only be regarded as a disappointment.",

Halfway the movie most of them wanted to leave...

      "reviewBody": "If you were to ask one hundred Danes about their favorite top one hundred Danish films, chances are they&apos;d mention a fair share of the same films. And a great deal of those will probably star Dirch Passer, Ove Sprogøe and Ghita Nørby and have been made mainly in the sixties. It&apos;s strange, then, that you can be fairly sure none or at least very, very few of those asked would mention this film. And I simply can&apos;t give good reason as to why.\n\nYou see, to me, this film is such a fine, little wonder. It&apos;s a classical sixties sex comedy, and it&apos;s as classically hypocritical as any from that age when it comes to gender and sex. If that bothers you, skip it. If, on the other hand, comedies from that age by such directors as Billy Wilder, Stanley Donen or Robert Mulligan are your thing, I suggest giving this one a chance.\n\nThe plot itself barely bears to be mentioned and really just serves as the base for a nice escapist venture in snowy Norway. Strøbye as the well-off Alan is tired of routines and his wife and her routines as well. His solution is as tired and trite as you might well imagine. An affair he&apos;s certain should be made permanent. To that end he needs out of his current marriage, but as he learns, that can be costly. So why not push her, gently, into the arms of a new lover that&apos;ll relieve him of any financial woes in a contentious divorce? And where better to meet such a man than on a nice holiday? And we&apos;re off on a ski holiday to lovely Norway.\n\nAxel Strøbye never quite reached the career heights of Sprogøe, Passer or Nørby although he was their equal in every way, and here he once again proved it. His character is the crux of the story and Strøbye carries it off marvelously. Nørby and Sprogøe flanks him wonderfully, though, and it&apos;s in this trifecta that the film lives and breathes.\n\nSprogøe is perfect as the slightly caddish pharmacist who&apos;s on the prowl on the slopes while Nørby brings her effortless charm to a role that admittedly doesn&apos;t have that much gravitas. We&apos;re in luck, then, to have Nørby in the mix as any less than her extraordinary charisma could have sunk the film.\n\nWhile the plot might be trite and seem flat on the outset, the script itself is better than you&apos;d have thought. Because what we get is dialogue between these three masters of their craft that&apos;ll seduce and beguile if you let it. It&apos;s endlessly quotable, along with intonation and look. Again, the plot itself is not the strength of the film and as it ventures into farce, we do see the limits of the film and the direction. But that&apos;s forgivable as what we&apos;re given along the way is more than enough to carry it home.\n\nThe supporting cast is made up of stalwarts of Danish cinema of the time and as such more than lives up to the main players while having less to do. And as it was with such films back then, we even get two memorable songs - the theme song sung by Bundgaard and a wonderful crooner style piece by the competent crooner, Dario Campeotto.\n\nI suggest watching this one on a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon for an experience as nice and cozy as the locales of wintery Norway themselves.",

Marilyn even gets to sing a few fetching song numbers (her saloon song atop a bar is a standout and she delivers a totally professional job). Sleepy-eyed Mitchum makes a good partner for Monroe and little Tommy Rettig scores as the adoring little boy who watches wistfully as Monroe strums a song on her guitar.\n\nInto the story, slight as it is, is an Indian attack while Mitchum and Monroe battle the rapids. It&apos;s all very routine going, for the most part, but the chance to see Monroe strut her stuff in a tight pair of jeans and Mitchum give a sturdy, likeable performance is enough to make the movie a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. \n\nNothing great here, but a very satisfying performance by Marilyn who does a more than competent job on her less than inspired songs. And the scenery helps. \n\nOtto Preminger&apos;s direction is not as taut as it should have been for a tale of this sort--in fact, the whole film has a lumbering pace that seems to make some parts of the story seem more like filler material than anything else. And poor Rory Calhoun has little to do."

The Siege is a dark, sadly prophetic, gripping thriller with an amazing cast. For reasons I will never understand this film was accused of having a racist message (probably by people who hadn&apos;t even seen it) although its intention very clearly is to convey anything but. But check it out for yourself; Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis are so good in this that their performances alone already make the film worthwhile. 8 stars out of 10.\n\nIn case you&apos;re interested in more underrated gems, here&apos;s some of my favorites:\n\nimdb.com/list/ls070242495",

      "reviewBody": "Herbert Goldman&apos;s recent biography of Al Jolson makes the case that with the release and success of The Singing Fool Jolson was at the height of his career. His big Broadway successes and all the songs associated with them were behind him and his future song hits would be identified primarily with film. And the incredible profits The Singing Fool was bringing to Warner Brothers because people could not get enough of the novelty of sound was giving Jolson new vistas for his talent. More people saw him in The Singing Fool than ever did on Broadway or all the road tours he made with his stage shows.\n\nIf The Jazz Singer was mawkish and sentimental, The Singing Fool doubled the bet in that pot. Jolson plays a singing waiter who gets a big break because a Broadway producer spots his act. A woman who is played by Josephine Dunn who wouldn&apos;t give him the right time of day before now sees success and its tied to Jolson. She and Al marry and they have a child whom we never hear identify as anything else, but Sonny Boy.\n\nIn fact the child is the only thing Jolson really cares about other than his career. When one is taken the other goes downhill.\n\nA lot of Jolson&apos;s previous song hits were interpolated into The Singing Fool as in The Jazz Singer. Two new songs were written for him and became identified with him, There&apos;s A Rainbow Round My Shoulder which to me fits his style perfectly and is the best thing in the film. The other is Sonny Boy.\n\nIn the film The Best Things In Life Are Free there is a scene where Jolson played by impersonator Herbert Brooks calls Gordon MacRae, Ernest Borgnine, and Dan Dailey who play the songwriting team of DeSylva, Brown and Henderson and asks them to write a maudlin sentimental ballad he has to sing to a child. They sit down and write one to those specifications and the three of them as well as Jolson are shocked it becomes a hit. Goldman&apos;s book says there&apos;s reason to believe the story is true.\n\nFor nearly the entire film Jolson plays it without blackface. Then the finale with him singing Sonny Boy again he dons the minstrel cork to me for no apparent reason. It will forever be a mystery to me why Jolson continued to use the blackface long after he didn&apos;t need to.\n\nFans of Al Jolson should see The Singing Fool and folks who want to know about his performing art should see it as well. It is mawkish, maudlin, and sentimental and all Jolson.",

      "reviewBody": "Where to start with this one? It&apos;s a kind of sequel to an Australian film called Patrick, which had a comatose man killing people telepathically. It&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve watched that one but I don&apos;t remember it being the most action packed film. The Italian version of this certainly ups it in every department. And then some.\n\nIn this one, Patrick is with his father beside a broken down car when someone tosses a bottle from a passing car and hits Patrick directly in the face. As with most head injuries, this causes Patrick to fall into a coma, but also gives him psychic abilities. Don&apos;t worry, it gets even more absurd from here on in.\n\nPatrick is now a vegetable staring into space, but also somehow hooked up to three people who are also in comas. If this was explained, I must have missed it, but what I reckon was these three were being used to somehow telepathically link Patrick up to...no, it&apos;s gone. Let&apos;s get to the victims instead.\n\nSix people have been invited to this mysterious villa, and you&apos;ll hate all of them on site. There&apos;s the Cough family (that&apos;s what the subtitles say), who consist of an alcoholic politician and his top heavy wife, then there&apos;s Mariangela Giordano and her drug dealing boyfriend, and then there&apos;s a cool-headed stranger and last but not least, a blonde woman whom I thought actually worked for Patrick&apos;s dad, but upon reflection I don&apos;t have a clue.\n\nEveryone&apos;s there for some reason, but there&apos;s no time to explain as everyone has to get naked first. Mrs Cough breaks out her fat rascals for no reason at all while Mariangela Giordano just goes straight ahead for some topless sunbathing, while making kissy faces at the stranger. The blonde isn&apos;t doing too well as Patrick seems to be hypnotising her and making her go to his room which eventually results in an eye-poppingly sleazy scene. Hey! You&apos;re not blonde at all!\n\nThis film is packed from start to finish with nudity (male and female) but wouldn&apos;t be worth watching if those horror elements weren&apos;t in there at all. Patrick starts bumping off the guests, starting with Mr Cough who gets boiled alive in a swimming pool, then things escalate to include impalements, beheadings, and Mariangela Giordani getting the Vlad the Impaler treatment. If you compare that with her death in Mario Landi&apos;s Giallo E Venezia, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking either Landi or Giodani had some sort of fetish. My money&apos;s on Gioradni, if we take in that scene from Burial Ground.\n\nI&apos;m guessing the only reason this gore splattered, nudity filled madness didn&apos;t get banned by the BBFC is because it probably wasn&apos;t released in the UK. It&apos;s crappily made, has terrible special effects, but still delivers 100% trash goodness.",

      "reviewBody": "The plot for this film does not need to be explained. It&apos;s basically a pastiche of The Italian Job, True Romance and melodramatic clichés. \n\nThe third element in the blender, mentioned above, along with a script short on genuine character development (You&apos;ll sometimes forget that Hayden Christensen and Zoe Saldana are in it) are distracting for a film which develops a serious tone, but there are positives, depending on your genre preferences. \n\nThe film moves along briskly, even as we deal with a cringe-worthy first half, and when the actual robbery gets going, the fun starts. Though the cinematography is modeled too much off of the Bourne-style shaky cam, the set pieces are still very well pulled off. \n\nThe extended car chases and shootouts contain a level of energy and suspense that really makes them standout, comparable to similar scenes in the above mentioned films, along with an on-foot chase clearly modeling itself off of the Madagascar chase in Casino Royale. Every car whizzing by, bone crunch or gunshot affects the audience due to mostly- proper use of slow motion, and great editing, both sound and film wise.\n\nThe melodrama may make some engaged viewers start laughing due to how it&apos;s put on screen, but as the stakes get higher, gels with the storyline. \n\nThe main cast, considering the material they are given, do the best they can, and their charisma is enough for us to care about them when the stakes get REALLY high, particularly in the case of Matt Dillon and Idris Elba.\n\nIt&apos;s highly unoriginal and contains several other elements worthy of nitpicking, but after evaluating how I had spent the past 107 minutes of my life, I think it got the job done.\n\nB-",

      "reviewBody": "The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle&apos;s &quot;28 Days Later&quot; was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn&apos;t get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters&apos; part.\n\nWhen environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a &quot;Rage&quot; virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a &quot;paradise&quot; where &quot;salvation&quot; can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.\n\nThis film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie&apos;s running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;,but where &quot;Dawn of...&quot; was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a &quot;What if...&quot; movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.\n\nAn very interesting and disturbing flick that probably sold itself wrong.",

      "name": "MGM Movie That Is Not As Good As It Could Have Been",
      "reviewBody": "I like the movie Moonfleet, but in watching Moonfleet, you are also watching the demise of a great studio, still trying to turn out quality pictures as the Hollywood studio system is collapsing and movie budgets are shrinking. Moonfleet is only 87 minutes long, there are no expensive exterior action scenes and dimly lit interior scenes are the norm. Even though shot in Cinemascope, Moonfleet is a budget movie using cheaper Eastmancolor, not Technicolor. Stewart Granger was still under contract, and the other starring roles are handled by European actors, who worked for less. MGM modified existing sets, cleaned off old costumes and started the camera rolling. For all of that, the picture is interesting as it deals with 18th century English smugglers and the story of young John Mohune. \n\nMGM executives must have decided that even with Fritz Lang, Moonfleet was not going to be a hit, which could explain the truncated story line and the always gloomy (cheaply processed) photography. On the TCM broadcast I saw, Moonfleet was in widescreen and had closed captioning. Looking as good as it ever will until the movie has a full restoration, Moonfleet is just too slow paced, without real kinetic energy. The talent is there, but probably for reduced budget reasons, Moonfleet can&apos;t grab your attention and keep it for even 87 minutes.\n\nAddendum: I just watched parts of Moonfleet again, from a download of a bittorrent file made from the French Time Warner DVD of this movie (An AOL Company was still part of the logo then, only two years ago). In a lot of ways, this movie is a reflection of the decline of Hollywood and the importance of movie studios in general. Director Fritz Lang worked for the UFA movie studios in the 20s making silents, made talkies in the 30s first in Europe then in Hollywood, and was running out the string in Hollywood when he made Moonfleet. At the end of the movie, when young Mohune leaves open the gate of Mohune manor, the gesture does not really change things. \n\nThe MGM logo included a gate in it, the entrance to a great movie studio. There is a silent 1926 documentary made by MGM showing the different departments in the dream factory, from warehouses full of period furniture to group shots of directors and cameramen and even a garage where wind machines and power trucks were kept. MGM was a giant movie company from the start when it combined Goldwyn&apos;s studio with Metro. Less than 30 years after that silent, the MGM studio was like the desolate Mohune family manor, its contract players and staff released, its Loew&apos;s theaters sold on the cheap, its Hollywood studio barely holding on as its New York board of directors decided to fire production head Dore Schary and cut movie production, placing the studio&apos;s survival on big pictures like Raintree County, Ben-Hur and How The West Was Won.\n\nMoonfleet is still with us, but MGM is now completely gone, its name tagged onto a film releasing company but the last of its small studio staff given their walking papers about two years ago. The fatalistic atmosphere that permeates many scenes in Moonfleet may be Fritz Lang&apos;s doing, but it could just as well be that it was hard for MGM staffers to think about happy endings as their studio was going under. And MGM&apos;s decline mirrored what was happening in the rest of Hollywood.\n\nUnder the conditions then, it was an accomplishment for the studio to make Moonfleet, hiring the talent not on payroll, preparing the sound stages for production and shooting the movie using the cheap Eastmancolor film. But to me, the picture is too much of a downer, the photography too dim and the storyline incomplete. Moonfleet is worth watching, it has a great cast but the movie needed a bigger budget to pay for better production values and scenes showing what Stewart Granger&apos;s character did after leaving Mohune manor. By 1954, MGM wasn&apos;t going to gamble on spending a lot of money on Moonfleet.\n\n20 Oct 2012: Just looked at the review ratings here. Someone in 2006, probably another reviewer, seems to have decided to hand out multiple negative ratings to almost all the earlier reviews. I couldn&apos;t care less about the number of &quot;not helpful&quot; marks I got. Still, why hand out more than one negative to the same review? Nobody really cares. Maybe the guy thought giving out negatives would get his or her review posted on the front page. If so, a pathetic commentary on one useless human being who visited the &quot;Moonfleet&quot; IMDb page.",

Not to mention the looming pollution in the sky in the film- but hey, because of fires in Canada, there&apos;s smoke over much of the northern US right now. I think the plot itself is very hard to follow- it&apos;s pretty loose. I found myself really enjoying the style and color choices, and was interested in the movie, though. This movie definitely won&apos;t be for everyone but I think a lot of the experimentation pays off and at only 80 minutes or so it is fun. There are few films I would compare it to but there are some Tank Girl and Brother From Another Planet vibes. I am definitely glad I got to catch this movie, it is full of energy and charm.",

Sadly, Lowe is no Ryan O&apos;Neal, and Colleen Camp, while lovely to look at, shows why she typically plays the Friend and not the Leading Lady in her many films. Still, good direction could have saved the day, but Bogdanovich is no less miscast than his actors. The sense of comedic timing, so crucial to this or any type of comedy, is sorely lacking here. Possibly the lion&apos;s share of the blame should lie with the film editor, but the director is ultimately responsible for the failure of this film.\n\nOn the other hand, Colleen Camp gets more screen time in ILLEGALLY YOURS than in any film I can remember, so fans wishing to see more of her will want to view this flick. Rob Lowe fans, on the other hand, will find it more profitable to spend their time on his other, much better performances.",

New and old footage was interlaced throughout and did a great job of telling the entire sick story up until President(I am a damn good crook)Nixon resigned, but it missed being a complete story in having no follow up about Ellberg&apos;s life afterward other than what he now looks like in interviews for this film.......how is he now publicly perceived?... how did he make a living after?... did he ever get his life back to &quot;normal&quot;?... and, most importantly, what does he think of his actions now and would he do it all over again after what money/reputation/street cred it cost him, or made him? These answers needed to be told and would have made it a full and complete story.\n\nWe sure needed someone like Ellsberg to expose Bush&apos;s Folly in Iraq. The very same lying caused the Iraq war........faked news stated by the President. Maybe that causes all wars? Why don&apos;t we learn better from these failures and not repeat them only one or two generations later? I think it is mostly because the people in power later are no longer the same people as earlier, and America is not a country that cares about or learns well/anything from its elder&apos;s experiences like some great, long-term societies of the past that were successful over thousands of years as a direct result of elder wisdom.",

      "reviewBody": "In Italy, the gambler and professor of poetry Daniele Dominici (Alain Delon) arrives in the seaside town of Rimini and is hired to teach for four months in the Liceu replacing another teacher. His relationship with his mate Monica (Lea Massari) is in crisis and he spends most of the time with his new acquaintances and gamblers Giorgio Mosca (Giancarlo Giannini), Marcello (Renato Salvatori) and Gerardo Pavani (Adalberto Maria Merli). In classroom, he meets the gorgeous nineteen years old mysterious student Vanina Abati (Sonia Petrova), who is Gerardo&apos;s girlfriend, and he feels a great attraction for her. They meet and know each other outside class, and they fall in love for each other. Their relationship leads to a tragic end.\n\n&quot;La Prima Notte di Quiete&quot; is a cold, melancholic, cruel and tragic story, with magnificent performance of Alain Delon, perfectly developing the character of a desperate atheist man in existentialistic crisis. The beautiful cinematography and the music score are cold, as the environment of Rimini, Sonia Petrova is one of the most gorgeous actresses I have ever seen and is also perfect in the role of an young woman with a hidden past. The personal dramas are disclosed and developed in a slow pace and are very sad. Unfortunately there is no other movie available on VHS or DVD in Brazil of this great Italian director Valerio Zurlini, who seems to have been forgotten by our national distributors. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Primeira Noite de Tranquilidade&quot; (&quot;The First Night of Tranquility&quot;)",

Helping Chan to put things right is Chu Tao&apos;s secretary Selina (Brigitte Lin), but her presence doesn&apos;t sit well with the inspector&apos;s jealous girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung).\n\nPolice Story is widely regarded as being amongst Jackie Chan&apos;s best films, but while it undeniably showcases some of the star&apos;s most incredible fighting and stunt-work—opening in spectacular fashion with the destruction of a hillside shanty town during a car chase, and closing with a jaw-dropping shopping mall showdown in which no pane of glass remains un- smashed—the simplistic plot and frequent Chaplin-esque comedy routines prevent it from being one of my favourites. Chan is renowned for his trademark blend of kung-fu and comedy, but in this case it seems out of place amidst the organised crime, murder and shooting.\n\n6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for the eye-watering moment three men fly through the top window of a double-decker bus and hit the ground in a most painful manner.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Kontroll&quot; gives me new hope that Hungarian filmmakers are finally capable to make pictures that appeal to audiences at home, movie critics (and probably also foreign audiences) alike. An excellent, though a bit weird mixture of satirical comedy, mystical drama and thriller. The metro stations become a world of their own, the neon lights create a new reality.\n\nWhile in the beginning the film focuses on a whole group of ticket controllers and we expect a satirical comedy about their lives, in the second half the storyline concentrates on the terrifying experiences of Bulcsú, a man with a mysterious past. He used to be an artist or in some other kind of creative business not specified further, but left this life for unknown reasons and started to live in the metro. It also becomes clear that for some reason he is not able to leave the metro system until the end - when he overcomes the dark forces (that probably have also been lurking inside him). Everything about this story is deeply irrational (except for the satirical elements that are in some ways very close to reality :-)), this is just a terrible world, where love means the only hope (I was a bit reminded of Terry Gilliam&apos;s &quot;Brazil&quot;).\n\nAn excellent movie that I would also strongly recommend to foreign viewers. I don&apos;t know if this will ever come to other countries, but I would very much like it to be so. So that Hungary could be put back on the landscape of international moviemaking.\n\nP.s.: The Budapest multiplex I saw this in was absolutely packed with people. I was astonished what a great success &quot;Kontroll&quot; has become in Hungary, because I think that most people in the audience there have probably never seen anything that could only remotely be called arthouse - and &quot;Kontroll&quot; wasn&apos;t exactly an easy popcorn movie....",

Calling it `Japan&apos; in order to associate an idea of spirit and transcendence that the western lacks is very naïve too, and that statement is certainly not translated in cinematic images during the film. I don&apos;t care if this is the real Mexico or not, I&apos;d only seen very low filmmaking approached from a very low place. For similar stuff, Tarkovsky created better fiction and Flaherty better documentaries. Firm candidate to be awarded in prestigious film Festivals"

      "reviewBody": "As the film opens Paul and Nana are going through a break-up. Each is filmed with their back to the camera. As Nana says she wants to die, it makes me think that, when we turn our back on the most significant person in our life, it can be like turning our backs on life itself. Such a big part of our identity is bound up with them that there seems nothing left. It is as if we have failed to heed the advice of Montaigne, quoted at the end of the opening credits: &quot;Lend yourself to others and give yourself to yourself.&quot; Of course, Godard may not be intending for me to have such thoughts. For much of the film I get the distinct impression that he does not want me to interpret anything as anything, but just to accept it as it is. But the film, within a few minutes, has sparked off some interesting and worthwhile thought in me and I like this. It seems to be what art should do. And that it should do it simply by existing, not by trying to convey some message of its own.\n\nFor much of the film that follows, part of my mind is taken up with enjoying the crisp black and white photography. The streets of Paris, and other simple but finely observed detail. The lustre of Anna Karina&apos;s hair – she plays Nana – is as enchanting as if I were talking to her. And maybe talking about nothing very much in particular so that my mind could wander to such things. The quality of the print is sufficient to make out individual hairs – or hairline cracks in walls and furniture.\n\nThe overall effect – taken with some other devices that I only slowly become aware of – is to give a documentary-like feel to what the camera is seeing. Nana splits from Paul and drifts into prostitution. It happens without any big dramatics. She has been working in a record store, is having trouble paying her back rent, and, after a few other minor incidents, we see her with her first client. The look of repressed emotion on her face is one of the most stark and memorable images in the film. A bit like Edvard Munch&apos;s painting, The Scream. But sublimated into what is portrayed as a very everyday setting.\n\nLater, in a rapid monotone, Nana&apos;s pimp even gives us a run-down of prices, laws, regulations and practices. It is almost the Brechtian splitting of the film into twelve chapters (each with long titles telling us what is about to happen), and Godard&apos;s increasingly frequent experiments that separate the sound from the image, that remind us this is fiction, not docu-drama.\n\nFor instance, towards the end and when Nana is with a young man she rather likes (and the attraction seems mutual, maybe love), their conversation is not heard by us but only seen on the screen as subtitles. They are communicating soundlessly perhaps, as lovers do.\n\nThere is a long scene where she discusses the meaning of language with an old man, a philosopher (played by Godard&apos;s former philosophy teacher). Although this is outwardly quite deep, I did not find the arguments nearly as profound or rigorous as in Godard&apos;s later film, 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her. Prostitution is not used here, as it is in 2 or 3 things, as a political metaphor. Susan Sontag, in her aptly titled essays, Against Interpretation, suggests that it is, &quot;the most radical metaphor for the separating out of the elements of a life – as a testing ground, a crucible for the study of what is essential and what is superfluous in a life.&quot; She sees Nana as having divested herself of her old identity and taken on her new identity – that of a prostitute.\n\nIn the version I watched, quite a few lines were omitted from the English subtitling, so my smattering of French came in useful. But I needed some of the subtler French puns on the &apos;life&apos; and &apos;chickens&apos; pointed out to me.\n\nAs the film came to its not untypically Godard-like abrupt ending, I wondered for a minute if it was as great as some people often claim. The celebrated critic Roger Ebert, for instance, singles it out as one of the great movies of all time. My mind wandered to such movies as Last Year at Marienbad, and Jules and Jim, both made about the same time and which have left quite a deep impression on me. But only for a minute.\n\nVivre Sa Vie is different, yet again, to any other work by Godard. But it is deceptively unassuming, and a remarkably solid piece of work for all its sense of transience (Godard compared cinema to a train rather than the station). It can also be seen as a love letter from Godard to his wife, the beautifully photographed Anna Karina.",

Unfortunately, a drunken technician overloads the electrical system, causing chaos. The eight minute short is a monument to early stop-motion effects and must have taken ages to film (and considerable patience from the two actors, who must have sat still for hours as brushes and razers were slowly moved across their bodies). The then-revolutionary stop-motion technique is very well executed, notably as many objects travel up, suggesting that they were somehow fastened and refastened to the set for each frame. There is not much to the film other than the novelty (at least in 1908) of seeing animated suitcase, chairs etc., but it&apos;s fun in a quaint way and will interest anyone interested in early science-fiction films or in the history of special-effects.",

In 1968 Joe Dante and producer Jon Davison, then college students, spliced this massive collection of film and television bits together and toured college campuses with The Movie Orgy. It was a four and a half hour bombardment of imagery from television, movies, old serials, news programs, musical performances, etc., to form a pop culture explosion of pre-1968 baby boomer nostalgia. It was a lot of fun, truly the most entertaining cinematic experience I ever had. For someone like me that was born around the time this film was playing the college circuit, it was a chance to watch the influences and yearnings of an entire generation before me splayed out in a bouillabaisse of cinematic insanity.

All the characters appear to be enjoying themselves most of the time, except Ben Affleck and Jamie Lee Curtis. And John Prine, who seems to be enjoying himself all the time.\n\nPrine&apos;s gravelly voice is a treat. Wait for the credits to roll and you will finally get to hear him sing (&quot;In Spite of Ourselves&quot;just right for this film).\n\nThe soundtrack is stunning, especially the acoustic &quot;Dixie,&quot; soft and reflective, strummed while Billy Bob reflects on himself.\n\nDon&apos;t miss the director&apos;s commentary. Billy Bob Thornton adds quite a bit of insight and detail to each scene. \n\nPour a glass of wine, build a fire, and enjoy.",

If I&apos;d known this was a weak independent movie with almost no budget I would have passed on it. As seeing as the title caught my attention I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe acting was horrible and you can almost smell the director attempt to pull off the &quot;hot Gothic witch&quot; vibe from The Craft during the beach walk scene that ended up ( like the last reviewer said) a 5 min music video of them walking across the beach. Not to mention the lead witch was breath-taking UGLY! I have so many bad things to say about this movie, and the ending didn&apos;t make a lick of sense. All I have to say, if you are looking for a good horror flick this isn&apos;t it. Don&apos;t watch it on TV, don&apos;t even rent it from netflick ( like I did), its is just really bad.",

The occasional entries from the eighties were simply a one off attempts to revive a genre which formally ended in 1978 but which had been in its death throes since the early seventies. This is a western for children directed by of all people Lucio Fulci with his trademark gore nowhere to be seen. Gemma who was always a heroic presence rather than an anti hero was perfectly cast for the film intended by the producers. The story has a young boy seeing his father murdered and murdering the Killer and taking his silver saddle.Growing up as a feared bounty hunter he saves the life and befriends the young nephew of the man he intends to kill for having commissioned his father&apos;s murder and from this point on the action and mild violence take a back sear to th relationship between Gemma , the kid his beautiful aunt and his partner a sympathetic crook excellently played by Geoffrey Lewis. A good but not exceptional score is aided by a catchy title theme in the De Angelis mold. Not a great film, maybe not even a great spaghetti western but very enjoyable from start to finish."

These are remembered after nearly 27 years. It is a must see for all good movie lovers. They will start liking the SuperStar. Today&apos;s generation have forgotten the greats of yesteryear&apos;s&apos;. RAJESH KHANNA is one who can never be written off.In Red Rose the climax brings out the best in him.

Yes, it is a bit slow in some parts but anyone who has been on a self-finding journey will relate, and laugh even more at the funny situations they get into. Germans and Japanese have a lot in common so that makes the misunderstandings real rather than the usual &quot;foreigners in Japan trying to make the Japanese seem like savage aliens&quot;. \n\nIn this time of reality TV and home-movies being used on various TV shows, the hand-held camera shots are very real. Also interesting is that the characters names are the actors real names so it adds to the effect.",

Everything what I liked about the &quot;Taxi&quot; series is gone! Apart from the climax which looked like a parody on Scarface there is not much action to be enjoyed! There are no car chases and none of the spectacular stunts we are used to from the &quot;Taxi&quot; series! That doesn&apos;t mean that &quot;Taxi 4&quot; is a bad movie! It has a lot of funny moments and you will laugh! But with the action missing the well balanced mix of humor and action is lost! It was nice to see the main characters some what matured since they have become parents! But it could have been much nicer if they showed more about the relationship between the heroes and their children! I hope this will be the last in the &quot;Taxi&quot; series! Because it only can get worse and that shouldn&apos;t happen! &quot;Taxi 4&quot; is a slapstick comedy that surely will find an audience! But my guess is that a lot of fans from the original Taxi will give this a miss!",

Man, those Technicolor films in the &apos;40s were beautiful, as this certainly is.\n\nFor entertainment, you get Fred Astaire dancing, Judy Garland singing, Ann Miller dancing, and Peter Lawford singing. I didn&apos;t think Lawford could sing, but he&apos;s not bad here. The other talent must have elevated his. \n\nAstaire consistently amazed audiences with his innovative dance routines and smooth style. He does a number here in a toy store that is really something! Miller also gives us a good tap number and Garland&apos;s songs are all winners.\n\nThis movie is more vehicle for those above-mentioned stars than it is in telling some profound the story. The story is not much, but who cares? It&apos;s the dancing, singing, the incredible costumes, overall color, nice people and just plain feel-good musical atmosphere that makes this a popular film, even to this day.",

Bravo once again Vanessa! Bravo ,endearing child Travor who one day shall be sitting alongside all the &quot;sacred monsters&quot; of the film industry. Last but not least,I honestly hope that Peter O&apos;Fallon continues selecting scripts that will hold audiences in suspense for a long long time."

      "reviewBody": "Paying homage to the post apocalyptic genre with echoes of stories like Fist of the North Star, Cyborg and the Postman this movie is infused with adrenalin, enthusiasm, rage, excitement, and action. It has a huge heart and the fact that it was made on a limited budget is testament to the skill and passion of those involved. They say that first time features made with limited financial support will have failings somewhere around Lighting, Script, Score and CGI. I am pleased to say that the piece is effectively lit even when filmed in cavernous tunnels. I rather like the CGI; it&apos;s obvious of course, but it offers a unique visual vista and blends well with the other outdoor scenes. The script, well, I watched the movie in German with English subtitles and found that the characters, although very familiar, (the hero falls somewhere between Kenshiro and Robin Hood) were comfortable rather than caricature. When the lead was doing voice over to convey his thoughts it really worked well for me, there was something about the sound of his voice that gave what I was reading some resonance. I thought the score generally worked well. I have some difficulty in accepting techno music in any setting; thankfully for me, its unwelcome intrusion was brief. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fight choreography and the stunt work. In addition to all this, some of the cinematography was extremely effective, especially the two wonderful sweeping shots on top of the building during the final showdown. I won&apos;t pretend that the story is anything new but it is carried off with such bare faced enthusiasm and more than a little respect for the genre that I can&apos;t help but like it. I tracked this down from the makers own website. I&apos;m glad to say that I was happy to pay the few euros for such a great product.",

      "reviewBody": "Without question, in its unedited form, SOLDIER BLUE is one of the most upsetting and violent films of all times, perhaps even THE most violent. This remains so, even though the film was released way back in 1970. And up until late 2006, you could only see an uncut version of this film via imports. Lionsgate Video, however, has rectified this.\n\nBasically a fictional re-enactment of the infamous 1864 Sand Creek massacre in Colorado by the U.S. Cavalry on a Cheyenne Indian village and the events that lead up to it, but actually based on Theodore V. Olsen&apos;s novel &quot;Arrow In The Sun&quot;, SOLDIER BLUE, directed by Ralph Nelson (of CHARLY and LILIES OF THE FIELD fame), stars Candice Bergen and Peter Strauss as, respectively, a Cheyenne-raised white woman and a disenfranchised U.S. Cavalry officer who have survived a savage attack by Cheyenne Indians on an Army payroll wagon train and are forced to be together to survive, even as they disagree starkly on who is right in the white man-versus-Indian conflict. Eventually, of course, they start to fall in love. This gives a story that otherwise might be interpreted as an arguably pretentious attempt to link the Cavalry&apos;s atrocities of the past to the modern Army&apos;s behavior in Vietnam a certain amount of emotional validity. But it also leaves the viewer heavily unprepared for the incredibly horrific massacre that climaxes the film.\n\nEven today, this massacre, a sequence of unbelievably extreme violence that involves hacked body parts, rape, and infinite bloodshed, makes SOLDIER BLUE very difficult for viewers to watch. In fact, when the film was re-released in 1974, much of that bloodshed was chopped off so the film could somehow get a &apos;PG&apos; rating; it is that version that American viewers have had to put up with on video until late 2006. Apart from the brutal nature of that final sequence, the film&apos;s depiction of the Army as a bunch of bloodthirsty savages does not make SOLDIER BLUE an easy film to agree with--and contrary to what a previous reviewer said, I don&apos;t think it even comes close to being a politically correct movie. It may not be a masterpiece, the way THE WILD BUNCH or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN were (and they too were incredibly ferocious in terms of violence). But it&apos;s good that SOLDIER BLUE has finally made it to DVD in its original uncut form so that people can now judge its validity in whole, regardless of its politics or, even more, its enormously graphic finale. It is a film that HAS to be seen today.",

He made a really good Tommy Dee. I saw the movie the other day and I still find myself having as much fun as I did when I saw it on Cable in 1981. Oh yeah Joe Pantiliano (Bad Boys, Sopranos) made a lasting impression as well. Great acting, fun for all. It is a must see for anyone with a dream. ( smile)",

I can&apos;t help but think that it would have been a lot more successful financially with younger, hipper stars. I also think that would have ruined it.\n\nThe direction is very matter-of-fact. Some movies like this reel you in with a definite &quot;atmosphere&quot;, stylized to death. I&apos;m tempted to say this movie has no style at all, but that would be a disservice to Hackman and Archer, who give it all the style it needs.",

They try to mix training scenes with scenes concerning the personal lives of the men, but it&apos;s all a mess.\n\nI wish I could list all the times I cringed in response to a particular line, but that is not possible. They follow one another like lemmings.\n\nSome visual effects were also off-putting, like when they trainees are rappelling up a cliff and one man&apos;s line comes loose and he plummets to the ground. The entire scene was contrived, amateurish and poorly done.\n\nObviously there are some people who liked this film, but I cannot recommend it.",

Funny and surprisingly smart screenplay by writer director Ron Shelton and Marin stealing every scene as Costner&apos;s sidekick/mentor. A real winner for anyone whoever considered themselves a loser."

But the satire dies out and the story switches to a too sentimental story with Dieter trying to get back his young friend Paul. Only at the end the satire comes back, but the viewer (at least this one) is already too bored with Paul to be interested again. The end of the film is very badly scripted: at once the film is over and the viewer waiting for a meaningful ending. Director Schabenitzky keeps the comedy and especially Hallervorden under control thereby avoiding getting it too farcical.",

The movie gets a little convoluted from there, as it seems Moon is having an affair with a guy who is maintaining the pool at their apartment building. I say seems because they are all of a sudden spending time together. I missed the connection, where it came from. Ah Moon dies in a plane crash and the pool guy spots Rosa (also played by Ms. Yau), who looks just like her. You wonder if they will have a relationship. There is a side story involving Tong (the always good Eric Tsang), who is a gay real estate agent. The also always good Sandra Ng plays a laser disc store manager. The problem is, Eric and Sandra&apos;s characters are kind of meaningless. Somewhere, there is an excellent film about tragically losing your love and encountering someone who looks just like her, to see if you can fall in love again. The film spends too much time on the relationship of Moon and Wai. I was waiting for Rosa to meet with Wai and see his reaction. Sadly, this film falls short, even though every actor I&apos;ve seen before (especially Ms. Ng, Ms. Yau and Mr. Tsang) has impressed me with their acting ability. I&apos;m sorry to say I cannot recommend this.",

      "reviewBody": "To my surprise, this was not a movie about the Temptations.\n\nThis is one of those cute &quot;black&quot; movies that makes white people wish they were black so they could have so much fun -- and I don&apos;t necessarily mean that in a cynical way. Others that come to mind are &quot;The Preacher&apos;s Wife&quot;, &quot;The Five Heartbeats&quot;... I like movies like this, if only for relief from always seeing the same white actors on screen.\n\nOf course, just like all Hollywood movies, it is total fantasy, and this one even more so seeing as it it was made by MTV (just check out the number of deleted music sequences on the DVD!).\n\nAnd if you love gospel music (even some who don&apos;t), you will love this movie, despite the fact that it looks like the songs were written first and a script later to patch them all together, taking many shameless cues from &quot;Sister Act&quot; -- both One and Two.\n\nThe script is pretty lame in many parts -- mostly with Cuba Gooding&apos;s lines -- and the punch depends on the goings-on of mostly bit parts. LaTanya Richards as Paulina is extremely convincing as the self-righteous church treasurer, but there are no really strong protagonists (the only one around dies in the first fifteen minutes) so she pretty much controls the plot single- handedly.\n\nThe movie is all about cameos. Cameos, cameos cameos!! Even Shirley Caeser plays (who else?) herself ! ! They might as well have called Beyonce Beyonce and Cuba Cuba.\n\nOne other good thing I can say for the movie is the positive mixing of races it shows, among so many movies that tend to show mainly conflict among them. In my experience, the kind of mixing as shown in this movie is the real world, rather than the 99.9% black &quot;Preacher&apos;s Wife&quot;, or for that matter 100% whiteness of so many movies. Sure, it may be fantasy (there is absolutely no racial tension present in this movie despite so much mingling), but I root for the positive image it projects.\n\nIf you are a cynic, this movie is not for you, but if you need some warm fuzzies, go for it!",

      "reviewBody": "In this first ¨Tulipe Noire¨ starred by Alain Delon took a chance and jumped from Film Noir , action genre to costumed comedy-adventures ; he steals the show as a masked hero relishing his secret identity on his horse called Voltaire and in cape and wielding sword ; executing bounds and leaps , twists and climbs and throughly enjoys himself . In 1789, at the beginning of French Revolution , an outlaw named &quot;Black Tulip&quot; held the surroundings of a town called Roussillon in fear . The inimitable Alain Delon in a double role as Julien De Saint Preux/Guillaume De Saint Preux, as he dons a black outfit and becomes the Black Tulip , the legendary masked , hero of oppressed who declares himself a revolutioner . Black Tulip riding in the hoof-prints, enjoys his hidden activity in black cape and wielding blade and helps the good people who are mistreated ,thwarting the ambitious plans of the meanie official , as the poor people respect him like a new Robin Hood . When he contends Baron Mouche (Adolfo Marsillach) , he was wounded , but then appears his twin brother . Meanwhile , he falls in love with gorgeous Caroline (Virna Lisi) . He battles against Marquis of Vigogne (Akim Tamiroff) , baron La Mouche and Prince of Grasillach (Robert Manuel) . Black Tulip&apos;s helped by a servant named Brignon (Jose Jaspe) and unites forces to Plantin (Francis Blanche), his beautiful daughter and revolutionaries .\n\nDerring-do , feats, adventures, humor and action find this agreeable swashbuckler . Alain Delon runs and jumps, bounds and leaps all over the images and Adolfo Marsillach overacting outrageously when plays the villain Baron . Black Tulip-Delon splendidly fights evildoers and greed oppressors , while saving his brother an the damsel in distress . Delon made the character of Zorro his own and quickly established himself as a French legend ; starring years later , a similar film titled ¨Zorro¨ by Duccio Tessari . Delon is terrific as the Black Tulip , well accompanied by ideal heroine , a pretty Virna Lisi . Nice cast keeps the picture moving at a rapid clip , special mention for Adolfo Marsillach as a grumpy and bungler baron in a sensationalistic and exaggerated performance . Being a French-Spanish co-production appears several secondary actors seen in usual genres of the 60s as Jose Jaspe , Alvaro De Luna, Jorge Rigaud , Enrique Avila , Perla Cristal and Laura Valenzuela , wife of film producer , Jose Luis Dibildos . The film is set during French Revolution , though was filmed in Spain, Sevilla Films, Madrid, (studio) and Trujillo, Cáceres, Extremadura ; displaying a colorful cinematography by Henry Decae . Lively and jolly musical score with rousing leitmotif by Gerard Calvi .\n\nThe motion picture was well-mounted and fast paced by Christian Jacque, an expert on adventures and historic genre as proved in ¨Fanfan¨, ¨Lady Hamilton¨ , ¨Madame Sans Gene¨ , ¨Madame Du Barry¨ , ¨Lucrece Borgia¨, among others . Ratinh : 6,5 . Worthwhile watching .",

Although it&apos;s not nearly as good as either of those films, it does deserve some credit. Where else can you see a blood-spattered bride team up with a priest, a mute telepathic little girl, and a 7-foot tall French-American drag queen? Nowhere I tell you. Did I mention they&apos;re on a mission to rescue the Pope? People keep comparing this film to Buffy the Vampire Slayer but I see more comparisons to Matthew Blackheart: Monster Smasher. They are both extremely colorful, oddly humorous, and set up for sequels. If you like horror-comedies with their tongue firmly planted in its cheek, check out Bloody Mallory. You could do a lot worse.\n\nNote for genre buffs: Valentina Vargas, who played Lady Valentine, was also the sexy Cenobite, Angelique, in Hellraiser: Bloodline."

      "reviewBody": "According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That&apos;s pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel&apos;s book of same title.\n\nPiscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.\n\nThere was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn&apos;t go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many &apos;wows&apos; while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.\n\nSuraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog&apos;s delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi&apos;s father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.\n\nThe older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??",

Its appeal is limited to those who dig plagiarism.\n\nAllie Haze as Princess Leia is the saving grace in her hot performance as Princess Leia, though the many alternates shown in audition footage on the 2nd disk of this over-priced package seem as intriguing: Kristina Rose and Misty Stone in particular. The rest of the cast is pretty lousy, especially Rocco Reed as Han Solo.\n\nThe second disk features a 55-minute NonSex cut of the feature (about 100 minutes of explicit footage removed), and the dumb dialog scenes are quite poor. Special effects and mimicking of the original material is adequate.\n\nSome very bad choices were made by Braun &amp; co., beginning with the director&apos;s misguided affection for the humor (not) generated by Chi Chi LaRue in voiceover: his American accent and gay persona for C3P0 is a drag. Tom Byron does a fair impression of Alec Guinness, while Braun&apos;s partner in crime (theft of intellectual property to be exact) Bryn Pryor gives a non-actor&apos;s version of the villain of the piece, Darth Vader&apos;s boss Tarkin. \n\nMost of the sex scenes are purely extraneous, notably a lesbian coupling for Kim Kane and Aiden Ashley (latter shown in auditions, failing to get the Leia role), but I did enjoy a couple of big-bust champs Eve Laurence and Brandy Aniston removing their Stormtrooper costumes and humping Chewbacca, as well as some more conventional interracial sex courtesy of Rihanna Rimes."

      "reviewBody": "Some of the hardest reviews to write are the ones where you don&apos;t know what to say. &quot;Awake&quot; is one of them. Let me just start with the basics. Do I recommend it? Yes. Is it GOOD? That&apos;s what&apos;s hard to say about this movie. Some parts of &quot;Awake&quot; are good, but some are merely okay.\n\nLike many thrillers, telling much about the plot defeats the purpose of seeing the movie. However, I will tell as much as I can.\n\nThe story goes like this. A rich young man named Clay (Hayden Christensen) goes into the hospital for a heart transplant, and he suffers from anesthetic awareness (meaning he can feel and hear everything, but can&apos;t do anything about it). This is key because what he hears changes everything.\n\nThat&apos;s about all I can say. &quot;Awake&quot; is an entertaining little thriller, and Jody Harold certainly has potential as a writer/director. His low-key handling of the film makes for an interesting, almost dreamy approach, but I don&apos;t know if it works like it&apos;s supposed to, because I have a feeling that it decreases the amount of suspense that the material warrants. That said, the unusual tone makes up for this deficiency.\n\nThe acting is solid too. Hayden Christensen became famous for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in the second and third &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes. His first outing wasn&apos;t great, and called into question his acting ability. However, his second round with the light saber was terrific, and his performance here shows that &quot;Episode 2&quot; was more likely to be an anomaly than the norm when it comes to his acting ability. His co-star Jessica Alba isn&apos;t as good, but it proves that she has more acting ability than many people give her credit for (her reputation for being a tabloid sensation and the limited acting options that result from it are probably to blame). Terrence Howard is solid, but he isn&apos;t given much to work with. Same goes for Lena Olin.\n\nPersonally, I think it sucks when you like a movie but a lot of that feeling disappears when someone points out something that causes that to decrease. Such a thing happened with me and reading a review after watching &quot;Awake,&quot; but I won&apos;t say it because it&apos;s still a good movie to see.\n\nSo, is &quot;Awake&quot; a good movie, or just a movie with enough good points to warrant a viewing? I&apos;d say it&apos;s somewhere in between, leaning more towards good.",

      "reviewBody": "There is no doubt that Tupac Shakur is one of the most intriguing, fascinating personalities in pop music history. He is made up of a seemingly endless list of contradictions: ruffian / nice guy, obnoxiously arrogant / sweetly humble, hedonist / activist, &quot;gangsta&quot; / poet. And most interesting is that none of these &quot;sides&quot; of him seem at all false. He really is that complicated.\n\nBeing a fan of his, especially his acting, (&quot;GRIDLOCK&apos;d&quot; is one of my favorite movies) I choose to remember the admirable parts of his personality more often, but I know that he was no angel, and I&apos;m glad that &quot;Tupac: Resurrection&quot; doesn&apos;t try to paint him as a hero.\n\nMade very much in the style of last year&apos;s great documentary &quot;The Kid Stays In The Picture&quot; (so much so that I was surprised there is no connection), it combines seamlessly edited footage, photos that &quot;float&quot; around to look 3-dimensional, well-chosen music, and fluid narration to create a dreamlike and slightly eerie portrait of one person&apos;s lifetime in his own words.\n\nUnlike &quot;The Kid Stays In The Picture&quot;, though, in &quot;Tupac: Resurrection&quot; the narrator telling his life story is dead.\n\nTupac is the one and only narrator of this film (through an edited collection of insightful interviews), and it&apos;s a distinctly poignant and eerie experience to hear it, almost like he is, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;-style, telling you his story from beyond the grave. Adding to the &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; feeling is that the story starts in Las Vegas where he was killed, and then rewinds to the beginning of his life. But sadly, you know it&apos;s eventually going to end up in Las Vegas again.\n\nThis is an extremely well done, gripping documentary that I highly recommend even to people who don&apos;t care for rap music. Tupac&apos;s life story is a true American tragedy, and anyone can learn from those.",

Marsha thinks that she should put Jimmy&apos;s cock back in his pants to avoid him embarrassment when he wakes up. Marsha has difficulty putting Jimmy&apos;s cock back in his pants as it&apos;s too big and hard and thinks that by licking it, it will slide back into his pants.

Both Jimmy and Marsha then persuade Aunt Diane to join in, with Jimmy saying he always fancied her.

      "description": "&quot;IT PURRS, IT STALKS, IT KILLS!\r\n\r\nWe all know director Lucio Fulci for his depraved nasties like New York Ripper, but if you&apos;re wondering why in France he&apos;s held in the same esteem as Hitchcock, then the deliciously eerie The Black Cat is a great place to start.\r\nInspired by the Edgar Allen Poe tale, this black cat is a malevolent moggy that stalks through a sleepy English town appearing to fulfil the murderous wishes of its owner, the sinister psychic medium Professor Miles (Patrick Magee in fine deranged form). What Professor Miles has not reckoned on is his cat turning him into the next mouse to slowly kill!\r\n\r\nHigh on gothic atmospheric thanks to the moody cinematography of Sergio Salvati, this unusual Fulci tale of claustrophobic terror is a little seen gem that compares to the best output of the Hammer and Amicus studios.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK CAT is released uncut on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment. The film will be presented remastered in 1.85:1 with English 2.0 sound. Also included on the disc is a Shameless original trailer gallery.",

And tears never stop from the beginning to the end. (I think the director wants to sale the tissues.) In fact, people there are all not bad guys, and they could have a peaceful life. For examples, Qiu Xia could live with her son in her ex-husband&apos;s house, at least for some time. But they just &apos;refused&apos; it.\n\nThe most shinning point is the little boy, around 5-6 years old. He played very good.\n\nSuggestions: All About Ah-Long (Chinese title:You jian A Lang), which is from HongKong, performed by Chow Yun-Fat. The plot is much better than this one, while the little boy also did a good job.\n\nThis is an old movie. Watching it today, I give it 6/10.",

The film made an overnight superstar out of Rajesh Khanna and Kaka, as he was lovingly called, ruled Bollywood for full five years (1969 to 1973) delivering fifteen consecutive hits in a row. A still unbroken record!!\n\nWhile I loved Aradhana in general, there were a few factors which made me watch it again and again :\n\nFirst and foremost, the Mere Sapnon ki Rani song, with its lively tune and excellent picturisation. The handsome Rajesh Khanna (with friend Sujit Kumar) in the jeep flirting with the gorgeous Sharmila Tagore aboard the Darjeeling train defines romance for me. Super!\n\nSecond, the Roop tera mastana number when in a weak moment, Rajesh and Sharmila consummate their love which doesn&apos;t end up in marriage due to Khanna&apos;s death and instead ends up with Tagore mothering his child who grows up to be Rajesh Khanna again (double role, o yea!). The sensuality of the song and Kishore Kumar&apos;s voice make it unforgettable. Erotica redefined!!\n\nLast but not the least, Sharmila Tagore herself, who has never looked more beautiful. Her character going from a youngster to an old mamma gives her ample scope to perform and she&apos;s earnest and sincere. I fell in love with her Aradhana so much that I hated that villain Manmohan for making unwanted passes at her.\n\nFor me, Sharmila was Aradhana and everything else about it was just an icing on the cake for me. Kaka included!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

      "reviewBody": "I have never really understood why so many stories of &quot;star crossed&quot; lovers are always compared to Romeo and Juliet, which, fair enough, was about families at odd with each other, but, in my opinion, Solomon and Gaenor is so much more.  A really sad story about bigoted people who are just perpetuating a centuries old hatred of people who are different to themselves.  The supposedly Christian people who should practise what they preach and the Jewish people who will not integrate for fear of losing something of themselves in the process is the real dilemma of this story. Solomon and Gaenor are the ultimate losers in this harsh Welsh world of miner&apos;s strikes and religious bigotry in the early years of the 20th century when everything was seen as back and white and there was no place for shades of grey inbetween. More people should have the opportunity to see this film which, as far as I know, was never shown in cinemas in Australia and only consigned to a late night viewing time on a little watched TV station, as there is a lesson to be learned from this really well acted film .",

That sounds a bit condescending, and indeed it s an old man&apos;s movie. But it&apos;s also a very good one, with superb choreography of the elements and many moments of  bliss (the shot of the loosened-up professor beaming as he rides a motor scooter is priceless). Sadly, it s hard to get beyond the wretched quality of the Eastmancolor print - there s virtually no green left in it, just a sickly pink. A restored print would surely add to the movie s emotional lushness, perhaps revealing whole layers of additional subtlety in the design, and giving it a sharpened modernity. Even as it stands, a beguiling film.",

      "reviewBody": "I think it&apos;s a great shame that the 1946 Walt Disney classic, &quot;Song Of The South,&quot; has been banned in the U.S. because some civil rights groups **15 years ago** complained that the movie was racist and they did not want it to be shown anymore. And Disney, not wanting to offend anyone, bowed down to their demands and yanked the film from public viewing in North America, where it has not been seen since. The only way you can watch &quot;Song Of The South&quot; now is if you still own a laserdisc player and you&apos;re willing to spring for a costly Japanese import disc, OR if you manage to track down a UK VHS copy of the film released in 1997 and have it transferred. Well, having viewed a transferred VHS copy of &quot;Song Of The South&quot; recently, I can honestly say that this is a marvelous Disney movie that is NOT racist and does NOT deserve to be hidden away. \n\nWhile I can certainly understand the concerns of the civil rights groups over &quot;Song Of The South,&quot; the fact that the movie is set during the turn-of-the-century South when many blacks served subservient roles is NOT a good enough reason to hide the film away from the public. This is not an issue of racism, it is simply a historical fact. Furthermore, the black characters in &quot;Song Of The South&quot; are all treated with respect. They are not treated badly, nor are they spoken to badly. Further still, are we going to destroy all copies of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; just because it features a black maid? Think about it.\n\nWhat also upsets me about the shunning of &quot;Song Of The South&quot; in the U.S. is that most Americans will now never get to see anymore the marvelous performance of James Baskett as the loveable storyteller Uncle Remus (and Baskett DID win an Honorary Oscar for his fine work in this film, lest we forget). Nor will Americans ever get to see again the wonderful Disney artistry on display in &quot;Song Of The South&quot; that perfectly blends live action with animation (the very first film to do so, if I&apos;m not mistaken). They won&apos;t get to enjoy the hilarious adventures of Brer Rabbit ever again. Nor will they be able to sing along with the Oscar-winning song, &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; anymore. All of this, in my opinion, is very, very shameful.\n\nI strongly implore Walt Disney Productions to reconsider re-issuing &quot;Song Of The South&quot; in North America, if *only* for a limited time on home video, so anybody Stateside who wants the film can finally have it. And with all due respect to the civil rights groups who complained about &quot;Song Of The South&quot; back in 1986, I strongly implore them to seriously rethink the ban that they had Disney place upon the film. On the Grammy telecast this past year, just before mega-controversial rapper Eminem took the stage to perform &quot;Stan,&quot; the Grammy president came onstage to give a little pep talk about freedom of speech &amp; freedom of expression. He said that we cannot ban certain artists and their work just because it makes certain people uncomfortable. The EXACT same thing can be said for Walt Disney&apos;s &quot;Song Of The South.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don&apos;t need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers&apos; comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most &quot;satisfying&quot;. A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn&apos;t really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it&apos;s only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn&apos;t always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. \n\nOn another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains &quot;propaganda&quot; is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it&apos;s a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It&apos;s astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin &quot;was no better than Hitler&quot; has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie&apos;s context - Klimov&apos;s picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it&apos;s about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I&apos;ve always believed there&apos;s something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.",

      "reviewBody": "This remake of the successful &apos;60&apos;s television show really is a waste of some good potential. It by no means is an horrible movie but the script isn&apos;t really interesting or spectacular and the character treatment is quite poor.\n\nIn a way this movie is a mixed bag. On the one hand it has some good actors in it and some of the special effects are really good but than again on the other hand the story is pretty shallow, the costumes are embarrassingly dreadful and some of the special effects are below average at best. Sounds weird, a movie that has both good and bad special effects in it. It&apos;s a bit weird, it&apos;s like they spend most of the time on the big special effects shots and after that they raffled the rest of the special effects. At times the movie is impressive to watch and at other moments it&apos;s just laughable bad to look at. Such as the CG character Blarp. He (or she?) looked absolutely dreadful and it made the movie even more ridiculous and bad to watch. But perhaps worst thing about the entire character is that it&apos;s a totally, completely unnecessary one that doesn&apos;t add anything to the story at all.\n\nThe movie has a solid cast. John Hurt certainly adds some believability to the silly moments in the movie and he deliverers some of the bad dialog good and even credible. Gary Oldman is of course also a great actor but he plays a bit of an uninteresting villain in this movie that doesn&apos;t get enough opportunity to shine. Matt LeBlanc is most of the time convincing in his role but he at times deliver some cheesy dialog which doesn&apos;t always make him believable as a tough space pilot. Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham also walk around in the movie but they get very little interesting to do. Good in her role was also Lacey Chabert. She&apos;s a good young actress, never really understood why she didn&apos;t appeared in more mainstream big Hollywood productions. She&apos;s an actress with great potential but somehow Hollywood never really picked this up. Maybe it has something to do with the failure of this movie?\n\nBecause yes, this movie is a bit of a failure. Not only in terms of how well it did at the box office and how well it was received by the crowd and critics but also certainly in terms of how the movie is constructed. The script is just disappointingly shallow and has some totally unlikely and unbelievable events in it, that at times don&apos;t even make sense. The story also uses too many elements from the first Star Wars trilogy and even a little bit from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It doesn&apos;t only uses story elements from that movies, it also rips off the looks of some of the spaceships, planets and city skylights. No, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; certainly isn&apos;t the most original science-fiction movie ever made.\n\nThe movie also lacks some good tension and action sequences. There are too many slow moments in the movie in which totally nothing happens. It&apos;s OK to have some slower moments in a movie but only when the script and characters are good and interesting enough to carry those slower moments. In this movie that really isn&apos;t the case.\n\nThis movie is not a complete disaster and the 4.6 rating here at the moment might be a bit too harsh. The movie does provide some good and entertaining moments. But if only the movie had a better and more original script, than this movie perhaps would had been a bigger success and certainly a better one to watch.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

HOWEVER, I took some friends to see it in the States and was shocked to see that some cretin(s) had re-cut this work of art to conform to what they perceived as the sophistication level of the USA audience.  This USA release was beyond belief!  &quot;They&quot; had changed the entire premise of the movie from a black comedy into an action/thriller cutting out the best comedic efforts of the actors.  I can resonably assume that the Matlin review reflects this version.  If ever the actors and director had a reason to sue for artistic perversion, this was it!  My question is &quot;Does anyone have another example of this happening?&quot;  While certainly aware of nude scenes being cut from USA films of this era I have never heard of the entire genre of a film being changed."

So, when I heard there was a sequel that was finished, it just was waiting to be released, I was obviously excited. And it had nowhere to go but downhill from there. First I heard that Eli Roth had nothing to do with this sequel, and I honestly don&apos;t think I need to elaborate anymore.\n\nThen, after stumbling upon the IMDb page for it, I saw that Rider Strong was in fact playing in this movie (I had heard that before this sequel was even in production, and I believe I had been told that it had come out of Eli Roth&apos;s mouth while talking about making a sequel). And since his name was at the top of the list I naively thought he was playing the main role. So my excitement had somewhat returned.\n\nI start watching it. Three minutes into it; SMACK! (pun intended). There went most excitement. The only reason I kept watching was to see what Deputy Winston had in store for us this movie (which was honestly very disappointing).\n\nI think the plot was very shallow, although it seems like they tried so hard to make it work. The gore was actually great, in my opinion (minus the throwing up). But the fact that they changed what this sickness/disease/infection does physically to people was just plain stupid. If this movie was just an original 80s horror movie and not a sequel, it may have been looked at as mediocre. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not an 80s original horror movie. It&apos;s a travesty sequel to a masterpiece.\n\n3/10"

I also enjoyed watching the very weak and predictable plot unfold on screen, because it is clear that no one involved in making this movie was trying to win an Oscar.

Some element of suspense is created in the film when the identity of robot on board the spacecraft is not revealed. Test Pilot Pirxa is a landmark film for Polish cinema as it was for the first time that futuristic sets were created for a Polish film.This was done to give a Hollywood kind of feel to this film.",

Even David&apos;s humor matched up to Jolie&apos;s spark and fire.  As for Hutton, he played the psycho very well, contrasting with David&apos;s calm delivery of life threatening situations.  Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and character development.  I gave it 8 stars.",

I see many people calling it formulaic but let&apos;s be honest, we all (or many of us) like the standard RomCom formula.\n\nHighly recommend if you fancy a new Christmas film.

      "reviewBody": "In films like &quot;First Love&quot;, the rotund, gravel-voiced Eugene Palette used to do a great turn as a man who watches with detachment whilst his wife and offspring made fools of themselves. Eventually, his bottled up indignation would explode to good comic effect. In &quot;Biwi Ho To Aisi &quot; (roughly, &quot;a wife should be like this&quot;) Kader Khan (or Kadar as he is credited here) is cast in the Eugene Palette role. He does a fine job of humouring his ill-tempered wife, whilst consoling her victims and confiding to the audience with direct-to-camera asides. Bindu, playing the domineering wife, roars round the house like a tornado, heaping high volume invective and scorn on all in her path whilst Salman Khan makes an energetic debut as a pop music loving teenager (in a sub-plot involving a deceitful girlfriend).\n\nFarooq Shaikh (here credited as Farouque Sheikh) shows again what a fine actor he is. His role calls for him to be submissive towards his mother, pally with his father, tender towards his adopted sister and romantic with Rekha. Their scene together, as they take refuge from the &quot;battle of the bindis&quot;, is particularly sensitive.\n\nRekha is at her best, playing a sort of Eliza Doolittle character. We see her first, dressed in a gorgeous South Indian costume, routing a village bully in an extended comic scene. Later, transplanted to the Bindhari household we see her circling her foe physically and psychologically; sizing her up during the battle of wills with Bindu. She also gets an opportunity to put her yoga training to good use in another action scene.\n\nThe usual, final plot twist is here made all the more enjoyable for being so deliciously implausible. Altogether, very entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "Sensurround!  How I do miss it!  How this movie misses it!  It was the best thing it had going for it when it was released in special theaters with sound equipment designed to vibrate your fanny as it sat snugly in those theater seats.   Unfortunately, without the vibrations, Earthquake just ain&apos;t as much fun.\n\nAs disaster films go, Earthquake is certainly not the worst, but is far from the best.  Charlton Heston, fresh from having saved a 747 from certain disaster in Airport 1975, now does his best to save the city of Los Angeles. To be fair though, we knew he wasn&apos;t going to stop the earthquake, leaving that for Christopher Reeve in Superman some years later.  But we just knew that as Construction Engineer, Stewart Graff he&apos;d do his best to save a lot of L.A. citizens stuck in precarious situations.  Why else would he be here? And just for fun, he even brought George Kennedy over from Airport 1975 with him although he&apos;s a cop named Lew Slade now instead of tinkering around with jetliners.  What a treat!\n\nIt seems that Lew Slade was chasing a bad guy who had been drunk driving and run down a kid.  Unfortunately the bad guy crashes his vehicle right on the property of Zsa Zsa Gabor, which is out of Slade&apos;s jurisdiction.  When another officer who is in the proper jurisdiction berates Slade for messing up Miss Gabor&apos;s shrubbery, Slade let&apos;s the young officer know how much he cares about plant life by landing a right cross.  This lands him a suspension, and supposedly helps us get to know his character a little better while we pat our foot waiting for the big rumble to start. Did you really think they were going to open a disaster film with the actual disaster?  There&apos;s a code in the screenwriter&apos;s handbook that says that&apos;s not allowed.  At least that&apos;s what I&apos;m told.\n\nMeanwhile somewhere else in L.A., Stuart Graff is married to Remy Royce-Graff(Ava Gardner) who was fathered by Sam Royce(Lorne Greene) when he was seven I think.  Sam is also Stuart&apos;s Boss.  Stuart is having an affair with Denise Marshall(Genevieve Bujold) who happens to be the widow of a former co-worker of Stuart.  We are not told whether Stuart had anything to do with the death of Denise&apos;s husband so he could put the moves on her but they could have added that to the plot too.  Generally in these types of films they throw everything in but the kitchen sink anyway so why not?\n\nThen on the other side of town we have motorcycle daredevil Miles Quade(Richard Roundtree) along with partner Sal Amici(Gabriel Dell) getting ready to put on the show of his life.  His sister is Rosa Amici(Victoria Principal, before Dallas)who has about the funkiest curly hairdo I think I&apos;ve ever seen on film.  Think Shirley Temple with coal black hair.  Then there&apos;s supermarket manager, weekend warrior, Jody(Marjoe Gortner)who happens to be a fanatic about women with curly coal black naturally curly hair as you&apos;ll soon discover.  Now all this might sound interesting on paper, and might make a good soap-opera. In this film it&apos;s all useless information since this is a film about an earthquake and after it hits we could care less about what happens up to that point.  Think of it as the filler before the thriller.\n\nEven without the oscillating seats, the earthquake itself is still fun to watch.  We get skyscrapers crashing to the ground, buildings falling on people, shards of glass piercing the good citizen&apos;s skins, people scalded by stoves, houses explode, freeways cave in, Stuart, Remy, and Sam get trapped in a high rise, a bar comes crashing down around Lew, Miles big motorcycle stunt comes crashing down, Rosa loses her popcorn in a movie theater, Denise&apos;s son takes a dive on his bike, and good boy Jody gets to put his uniform on and show us just how psychotic and messed up he really is. This is cool stuff folks even for 1974 type special effects.  Unfortunately, the Earthquake momentarily subsides and we are left to deal with some of the silly plotting the film started out with.  Guess you can&apos;t have everything.\n\nIf you can overlook the usual silliness and terrible dialog which seems to go with the territory in disaster films, you might be entertained by some close calls and daring rescues after the earthquake.  You&apos;ll certainly get a few laughs out of Marjoe Gortner&apos;s cracked-up soldier performance.  George Kennedy is pretty darn good as the cop.  Heston is better than he was in that Airport thingy, and though his romance with Bujold is an obvious mismatch, it doesn&apos;t come near to equaling the absurdity of his relationship with Karen Black on that 747.  Ava Gardner plays the bitchy Remy as if she were competing for the Shrew Olympics.  Lorne Greene looks as if he wishes he was back on the Ponderosa with Hoss, Adam and Little Joe.  Richard Roundtree is fun as the daredevil, but we see little of him after the earthquake.  Tiger Williams as Denise&apos;s son Corry spends most of the film unconscious and we are grateful for that.  Usually the kids in disaster films are scripted to be overly cute and annoying.  I think there&apos;s a rule in the screenwriter&apos;s disaster film handbook about that too.\n\nIf I have one suggestion to make it would be avoid the version of this film with the added TV footage at all costs.  For those of you familiar with Welcome Back Kotter, if you see any footage of  Rosalie &apos;Hotzie&apos; Totzie(Debralee Scott)riding an airplane, change the channel, remove the tape, just do what you have to do.  Why this goofy footage was ever added is beyond me.\n\nIn it&apos;s original form my grade for Mark Robson wiping out L.A.: C- Hotzie Totzie gets an F and it&apos;s back to the sweat hogs for her.",

      "reviewBody": "In this third chapter from the Book of Dirty Harry Callahan, there&apos;s plenty of action as Harry breaks in a new partner and goes after a ruthless bunch, some self-proclaimed revolutionaries who are nothing more than common criminals, in `The Enforcer,&apos; directed by James Fargo, and starring Clint Eastwood and Tyne Daly.  And beyond the action, it&apos;s a film that manages to make a valid statement about bureaucratic nonsense, as well as the lack of common sense employed by those ensconced in the budding agenda of `political correctness,&apos; who put an emphasis on image over purpose and results. Mostly, though, it gives the audience a chance to share vicariously in the triumph of good over evil, as Harry once again metes out justice in his own inimitable way.\n\nAfter taking charge and cleaning up a hostage situation in a way that only `Dirty Harry&apos; can, Harry (Eastwood) is assigned to a desk job in personnel. But when his partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) goes down on the job during the robbery of a munitions warehouse, Harry is back on the street, but with a new partner, Kate Moore (Daly), one of the first female inspectors in the country.  And Harry puts her through her paces as they attempt to track down this particularly volatile gang, who seemingly put little value on human life as they cut their swath through the city of San Francisco and pursue their own `for the people&apos; agenda, which in reality means they want to get their hands on as much cash as possible, and plan to hold the city hostage to do it.  But they had better think again; because when they took down Frank, they inadvertently provoked the ire of Inspector Callahan himself, who does not take kindly to their sort to begin with. \n\n James Fargo is in the director&apos;s chair for this one, and he comports himself well, recapturing all of the attitudes and elements that made the first two `Dirty Harry&apos; films so successful.  Fargo sets a good pace and keeps the story on at least an equal footing with the action, which keeps this one involving.  Giving Harry a female partner puts some added interest into the mix as well, in light of the fact that this film was made in an era in which women were just beginning to emerge in such positions, on the screen or otherwise.  `Cagney and Lacey,&apos; for instance, was still some five or six years away, and Kathleen Turner&apos;s `V.I. Warshawski&apos; wouldn&apos;t make an appearance until 1991.  Initially,  the film takes something of a patronizing attitude toward her, but Harry treats her as an equal from the beginning, and in the end, Inspector Moore emerges as a strong character, gender aside.  Most importantly, that is not the focus of the filmmakers here, and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history; Moore is just another character in the `Dirty Harry&apos; saga, and she&apos;s a good one (especially when compared to Harry&apos;s partner, Al Quan-- played by Evan C. Kim-- in `The Dead Pool&apos;).  And credit Fargo with insuring that it all blends together naturally within the context of the story, as well as the fact that he keeps the relationship between Callahan and Moore on task, and allows it to develop quite credibly.  All in all, it&apos;s a good, collaborative effort from all concerned.\n\nWhat really gives this one that ring of authenticity, however, is that Clint Eastwood is in top form, and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.  And, in the final analysis, story aside, it&apos;s the `Dirty Harry&apos; character that makes these films so popular and successful.  Creating a cinematic icon is no easy task, and that&apos;s precisely what Eastwood has done with Harry; and it&apos;s gratifying to see that he is willing to give that 110% at this stage of the game, in order to maintain the credibility of the character and the films, as well.  A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now, while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.  It demonstrates what a pro Eastwood is, and why he commands the kind of respect afforded him within the industry.\n\nTaking on the role of Kate Moore had to be a challenge for Tyne Daly, and happily, she succeeds quite well with it.  She makes her character convincing by allowing her to develop in a `real time&apos; manner; she doesn&apos;t just jump in there, full blown and ready to take on hardened criminals. Initially, she displays some intimidation in Harry&apos;s presence, which gives their relationship some realism from the beginning.  After all, Harry IS an intimidating guy; add to that the fact that this is a new job for Moore, which in reality would create a level of discomfort for anyone, anywhere. And Daly has tapped into all of that with her portrayal of Moore, making her a very believable character, and one of the most memorable from among the five `Dirty Harry&apos; films.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Harry Guardino (Lt. Bressler), Bradford Dillman (Capt. McKay), DeVeren Bookwalter (Bobby Maxwell), John Crawford (The Mayor), Samantha Doane (Wanda) and Albert Popwell as `Big&apos; Ed Mustapha (look for Popwell in the original `Dirty Harry&apos; as the Bank Robber; in `Magnum Force&apos; as pimp J.J. Wilson; and again in `Sudden Impact&apos; as one of Harry&apos;s partners, Horace).  A well made and entertaining film, `The Enforcer&apos; keeps the `Dirty Harry&apos; series alive, well and on solid ground; in retrospect, it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment, `Sudden Impact,&apos; as with the dreadful `The Dead Pool&apos; in 1988, it all ended with barely a whimper.  The first four, however, more than make up for it-- and that&apos;s the magic of the movies.  8/10.",

I don&apos;t normally enjoy musicals, but this was an exception.  The singing &amp; dancing were terrific.  The title song is a big hit in India.  The movie didn&apos;t look much like the India I saw, but the cinematography was excellent, and the sound was Dolby Digital (Indians like their movies loud).  I could follow the storyline even though I understand no Hindi.  It helped that there was a smattering of english throughout the movie. I can&apos;t wait to see it again with subtitles.  Apparently most Indian movies have the same plot, singing, and dancing, so if you have seen a lot of these movies, it may not excite you like it did me, but I thought it was a well made (slick comes to mind), well acted, and a well produced piece of &quot;Bollywood&quot;.  The producer introduced his son with this picture, and he has become the heartthrob of India.  I&apos;m not good at analyzing movies so I&apos;ll finish by just saying, I came out of the theater with a smile on my face, and a tune in my head. This movie was FUN!",

The Technicolor is gorgeous, and narrator&apos;s voice is classically 50&apos;s. The score is whimsically apt, and the whole effect is just campy fun. &quot;The Living Desert&quot; is a truly enjoyable film. It educates without lecturing - a rare and very appealing quality. Children and adults will both enjoy following the antics of the kangaroo rats and other creatures of the desert. This film is a great example of the kind of wonderful work the Disney studio used to produce. One note of caution - if you are squeamish about insects, spiders, or snakes, don&apos;t watch this!!! All three get plenty of screen time, in full-blown Technicolor close-ups. I definitely had to close my eyes when the tarantula was on screen. Eek!"

I did enjoy the comedy bits of Jessica and Dane had a few decent moments.\n\nBut this &quot;Comedy&quot; more or less tries too hard at being funny and it just can&apos;t work like that you can&apos;t force people to laugh at what&apos;s not funny and this movie has a good bit of none funny and gross comedy I can&apos;t stand at all\n\nIt&apos;s just nothing special or highly original about this film to make it one you must rush out to get and add to your collection Again it just feels like a porn comedy and that&apos;s really said\n\nIt only has a handful of moments that makes it watchable but other than that it just weak. \n\nThe plot is something we have seen many times before the acting I can&apos;t even say was good or bad it just plain at best\n\nJust only watch it if you&apos;re curious other than it&apos;s not worth a lot\n\nI give Good Luck Chuck an 5 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "One of those films from the early 1970s a modern audience can only watch in amazement.  The story revolves around the &quot;Haus&quot; of the title - a male brothel, situated in Hamburg.  That in itself is not a surprising topic for a German movie of that period, just about anything to do with sex was given the cinematic treatment.  Such films were mostly comedies, and this one certainly is - so please do not expect a realistic depiction of male prostitution.\n\nAlfred Vohrer not only directed this film, but also recalled some of his regulars from his Edgar Wallace movies, most notably Siegfried Schürenberg and Eddi Arent.  These two were largely responsible for comic relief in the Wallace thrillers, and they simply felt no need to adapt their style for this genre switch; especially the Werner Zibell character is just about the same guy as Sir John, merely running a brothel rather than a police force. Other casting choices add to the sense of oddity, e.g. Willy Harlander is at least a strange choice for playing one of the studs.\n\nA traditional German comedy had to include a romantic love story, and would you believe it, this film is no exception.  Understandably, Zibell is not pleased when he finds out that his daughter is dating his newest employee, and from there the story follows the familiar pattern of romantic comedies. But one thing is strange: the daughter has no knowledge of either the origin of her father&apos;s income or her boyfriend&apos;s night job, but when she finds out she doesn&apos;t bat an eyelid.",

      "reviewBody": "Apparently novelist Erich Kastner was none too keen on this adaptation by Billy Wilder, with a little help from an uncredited Emeric Pressburger but the film was an unqualified success commercially and ranks as yet another gem of Weimar Cinema.\n\nAll the elements have come together here to produce a work that has retained its magic, freshness, charm and immediacy ninety years on.\n\nThere is a splendid score by Polish born Allan Gray who was to continue the Pressburger connection, notably with his scores for two of Britain&apos;s greatest, &apos;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&apos; and &apos;A Matter of Life and Death&apos; whilst Werner Brandes&apos; candid camerawork has succeeded in making the city of Berlin an active participant in the plot. Especially impressive is the sequence where Emil Tischbein and his ever increasing gang of children pursue and corner the thief Grundeis.\n\nDirector Gerhard Lamprecht has worked wonders with his untrained youngsters and the inclusion of one girl amongst the boys is inspired. She is played by Inga Landgut, one of M&apos;s unfortunate victims in Lang&apos;s masterpiece from the same year. Playing Emil made an overnight star of Rolf Wenkhaus who went on to play a youth of an altogether different stamp in &apos;S. A.-Mann Brand&apos; and died in combat in 1942. There is a touching performance by Kathe Haack as Emile&apos;s mother and what can one possibly say of Fritz Rasp who portrays Grundeis? A highly unusual artiste with an imposing and at times menacing presence who made his debut in 1916 and was still acting until the year of his death in 1976. He is perfectly cast here and being costumed in black adds to his villainy.\n\nThis is the first version on film. Often imitated, never bettered.",

Typically Troma, you´ll find lots of cheesy F/X and bad acting in it, however this shot is not as awful as many other flicks produced by this company: &quot;Troma´s War&quot; is REALLY entertaining, what´s absolutely no guarantee for the other works of Lloyd Kaufman´s firm. The humor is not too silly this time, although there are many politically not correct jokes about Aids or Siamese twins. The violence in this film is business as usual, so prepare for cut off ears and fountains of blood! With its exaggerated patriotism &quot;Troma´s War&quot; is also a nice parody on all those soldier-movies like &quot;Rambo&quot; or &quot;Delta Force&quot;, which were very popular in the Reagan-ruled 1980s. And some nudity of pretty silicon-chicks doesn´t hurt either..! I liked this movie even more than &quot;Combat Shock&quot;, that is alleged to be a touching anti war-drama, but after all only a cheap and boring film! This one doesn´t take itself too serious and that´s no mistake!! So if you´re going out tonight to rent a Troma-flick... take this one!!!"

The same goes for the rest of the movie, what a production! Big crowds of people in one scene, big heaps of junk in the next. The room with the stormy waters outside in one scene, and barren landscape outside later on. I can only imagine the amount of work put into making this movie look like it does.\n\nSo that&apos;s one thing. I&apos;m having difficulties thinking of other things I liked with the movie. Some of the sequences drag on for way too long without really adding anything to the movie (as far as I can tell). I must admit that I&apos;m not entirely sure what Lopushanskiy is trying to do or say in this movie. I guess it can be seen in light of communism and parts of the communists regimes. The elites being anti religion, and the people treated badly. But the religious aspect of it also brings my mind to Judaism. God&apos;s chosen people treated like animals. Maybe I&apos;m being too specific, and he is trying to say something about man in general. But is it a message of hope? Or hopelessness? The movie was not able to hold my interest in the plot, and so I also lose interest in whatever message it is trying to convey.\n\nThat said, it&apos;s worth watching for the visuals alone, and I&apos;m sure other&apos;s will find more in the plot than I did. Maybe it helps knowing more about the context in which the movie was made?",

      "reviewBody": "Stephen Fry is such a prodigious polymath that it&apos;s no surprise what a good fist he&apos;s made of his directorial debut.  That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s wholly successful; the characters are so shallow that it is hard to warm to them, although it should be pointed out that this is not necessarily a fault. Indeed, it&apos;s refreshing these days to find a film in which characters are not trying to ingratiate themselves.  Emily Mortimer is exempt from this observation in any case, as she&apos;s just so adorable - and is it just me or does she look a dead spit for the young Mary Steenburgen?\n\nI found not only the camerawork but the lighting extremely gaudy, sometimes offputtingly so.  However, Fry is admirably adventurous in some of his camera sweeps, not playing it safe as some inexperienced directors do.\n\nAs to the performances, it is true that Simon Callow hams it up quite outrageously (although he still wrung a couple of chuckles out of me), and I found Michael Sheen&apos;s uber-camp queen rather wearing, until his scene at the end which I thought he handled well.  I know I&apos;m not the first person to say this, but it bears repetition: Fenella Woolgar is a revelation in this film, conveying the insouciance of the upper class effortlessly (and the scene after the &quot;orgy&quot; with the stern family is priceless).  James McEvoy was excellent too.\n\nOh, and by the way, to whomever described Evelyn Waugh as &quot;herself one of the beauties of the age&quot; - you may have been joking, but in case not, Evelyn Waugh was in fact a curmudgeonly man who would no doubt have snorted to hear himself thus described!"

      "reviewBody": "A nice follow-up to blockbuster fantasy epic that renewed Hollywood&apos;s faith in media blitzing. Batman returns contains a lot of noisy action ,thrills, chills and dazzling production design. The caped crusader is back in Gotham City, where even the criminals are afraid to walk the streets alone. There&apos;s a new breed of criminals in Gotham City led the the sinister the Penguin. While Batman (Michael Keaton) deals with a deformed man calling himself the Penguin (Danny DeVito) wreaking havoc across Gotham with the help of a cruel businessman (Christopher Walken), a female employee (Michelle Pfeiffer) of the latter becomes the Catwoman with her own revenge. From the Sewers of Gotham, and New Villain Emerges. From the Rooftops of Gotham, the Purrrfect Enemy Comes to Life. And the Only One Who Can Save this City, is a Creature of the Night. While She Craves a Romance She can Sink Her Claws Into, He Plots a Fowl Reign of Destruction, Above Gotham, Looms Its Greatest Hero.\n\nThis is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie. Full of action , it&apos;s complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming fights and traditional FX along with brief computer generator special effects. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film Batman (1989). The picture relies on terrific flying sequences, impressive struggles, black humor and breathtaking pursuits. More of the same from director Tim Burton with Batman more of a supporting role overshadowed by provocative villains. With Danny DeVito cruely misshapen Penguin who seeks to role over Gotham City. Michelle Pfeiffer is the dangerous and exotic Catwoman who has more than a passing personal interest in Batman and Christopher Walken in the maniacal tycoon Max Shreck. Keaton is surprisingly good as the dual personality hero though Pfeiffer steals the show, she fares best in her wickedly sexy character and second-skin costume completed with bullwhip.\n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Tim Burton. Being preceded by ¨Batman¨ (1989) with similar cast : Michael Keaton , Michael Gough, Jack Nicholson , Kim Basinger , Robert Wuhl , Tracey Walter , Pat Ingle , Jack Palance. Followed by ¨Batman and Robin¨ (1997) by Joel Schumacher with Val Kilmer, Chris O&apos;Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone , Michael Gough , Arnie, Pat Ingle , John Glover. And ¨Batman Forever¨ (1995) by Joel Schumacher with George Clooney, Chris O&apos;Donnell, Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Drew Barrymore , Deby Mazar , Don Dragon Wilson, among others .",

Let&apos;s face it, the idea of murdering children and/or children getting murdered remains a fairly sensitive topic and especially nowadays filmmakers don&apos;t always have the courage to depict everything in great detail. Another big issue is that the scripts are rarely ever strong enough to come up with an explanation that is simultaneously disturbing and plausible. &quot;The Plague&quot;, which is somehow linked to the creative writing mastermind Clive Barker, is fairly adequate and satisfying when it comes to dealing with the first issue (there are some very graphic child murders here), but it miserably fails in the plotting department. I just finished watching the film five minutes ago, but please don&apos;t ask me to summarize the plot. The film benefits from a handful of really powerful sequences and an occasionally unsettling apocalyptic atmosphere, but the screenplay is incredibly disorderly, incoherent and it explains absolutely nothing at all. On a seemingly average day, all the children on the earth under the age of 9 fall into a coma. Twice a day, like clockwork, they all start twitching together but the reasons for that are anyone&apos;s guesses as well. Then, as spontaneously as they fell into a coma, they all awake ten years later as mad zombies and promptly begin to exterminate all the adults for  you guessed it  no apparent reason whatsoever. The film follows a small group of people&apos;s quest for survival in a quiet little US town, among them an ex-married couple (Ivana Milicevic and James &quot;Dawson&quot; Van Der Beek in a totally unconvincing performance), a couple of cops and a pair of adolescents who&apos;re spiritually linked to the children. The sequences illustrating the zombie children prowling the deserted streets for adults to kill are reasonably effective and creepy, as well as the make-up jobs on their faces, but the film never achieves to be truly terrifying.",

I expected something &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;-esque scripted to it&apos;s nation&apos;s culture, however sitting through this Indonesian horror I couldn&apos;t help but allude to what I felt were other American influences. The overall mostly surreal tone seemed very Lynchian, the scenes in the theater had a Mulholland Dr vibe &amp; the foreboding rickety old lady reminded me dearly of the Log Lady in Twin Peaks. The script seemed, to me, to draw some influence from Shutter Island &amp; that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say about that. Of course these ideas &amp; artistic direction could have developed completely independently, regardless, as a fan of what I just referenced, this film left me pretty satisfied. Definitely worth the time IMO.",

      "reviewBody": "This film made after Almodovar&apos;s first more upbeat outrageous films, is a film that tells of the end of the Movida Madrilenia, a movement existing in the early eighties in Madrid that was defined by a mixture of new romantic punk and pop, and the ironic use of Spanish folklore and the &apos;housewife&apos; culture. When people in this subculture started to commonly use heroine, the downfall of the movement had begun. This film is about the choices that people had to make at the end of this era. some stayed junkies, others died, some went back to the small towns where they had moved from, others went on to give up on drugs and become more constructive. The convent where the nuns reside can be interpreted as the habitation of this irreverent movement, frequented by police searches, dealers, artists, and junkies. The movie has some great musical moments which indicate that Almodovar might one day take his hand to this genre. The religious element interwtined with (homo)sexuality will certainly be proliferated again in the forthcoming movie La Mala Educacion. The movie also contains a cameo of a Spanish &apos;Harrold Robbins&apos; type of writer, who is featured sitting at one of the tables wiping her mouth with a handkerchief as Yolanda sings in a night club at the beginning of the movie. This authopr refers to the character of sister Rata de Callejon, who has a secret career as trashy novel writer. The film is somewhat darker than most of Almodovar&apos;s early movies, but is very gentle, provides enough comedy and the characters above all remain very human, all of them have their virtues and vices.",

The complete desire and need for another person, wanting to hold them close to you, while at the same point in time the mere vision of seeing that person and hearing their voice sends you into utter misery and you feel repulsed by them. Jude Law is masterful in his role, and he is matched equally by the performances of Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts. A brilliant movie with many mixed emotions. As soon as you think, okay, this is where they live happily ever after, another twisting tale occurs. This is as real as it gets folks. Definitely one worth purchasing when it hits DVD, apart from that, watch it on big screen and you will be amazed at how you relate to this master piece."

Then we have to sufferer through what looks like military drills even for women.\n\nThere are artistic dance scenes with historic value as the first appearance of Leni Riefenstahl. There is a hand full of birthday suit scenes. All the youngsters look malnourished. They may be healthy but it looks like they go from malnourished to looking chunky and touting spare tires.\n\nOther than for historic value (I like to collect UFA) there is not much to redeem. That is unless you are an exercise fanatic.\n\nJust a note the intertitles are in simple German and they stay up long enough to read and have time to interpret if you are not familiar.",

      "reviewBody": "If there is one person in Hindi Film Industry who has skillfully learned the art of how to exploit each new opportunity coming his way for the benefit of his own banner then it has to be none other than Mahesh Bhatt. The man sights a great potential money spinner the moment he sees the famous porn star Sunny Leone featuring in the TV reality show Big Boss, makes arrangements to enter the house personally to offer her a film and superbly starts the publicity campaign of something which was not even there on papers right from inside the big boss house.\n\nNot only that, but in the next few months, he professionally works on the project within a fixed budget, writes the film himself (inspired from Hitchcock&apos;s Notorious), gives the direction to her daughter Pooja Bhatt and releases the film with some controversial posters (reportedly inspired/copied from Goa based designer Felix Bandesh&apos;s 2008 fashion photo-shoot) on a festival day in India to ensure a great initial. \n\nBut on the other hand, as I watched the film, it surprised me a lot with its childish content which had nothing to say at all besides its expected body show from a western porn star. Said to be a Crime-Sex- Thriller, the film has neither got any thrills nor any excitement in its immature storyline only interested in showing you Sunny&apos;s bare backs, her steamy kisses and the abrupt sex scenes retained after the cuts ordered by the Censors. So, it was really shocking for me to realize that the film was written by Mahesh Bhatt himself, who had a lot of power in his vision, repeatedly proved by his own masterpieces in the past.\n\nIn strong words with JISM 2 both its writer and the director try to make fool of we, the audience as if we are only there to see Sunny Leone without her clothes, locking lips every five minutes. In this context I would like to remind both Pooja Bhatt and Mahesh Bhatt that please don&apos;t treat the audience as dumb minded people who would just applaud anything served by you in the name of SEX. Because what you are selling to them for a price in the name of Sunny Leone, a lot more than that is easily available free of cost on a simple click all over the net. So please don&apos;t take us as granted every time you make a movie, which in reality is a mere commercial project rather than being a creative expression of a visionary. And as far as direction is concerned Pooja Bhatt should stick to producing films and avoid directing them for the sake of her own banner.\n\nComing to the performances, only Randeep Hooda seems to be acting in the film to some extent and the rest are all doing their offered jobs as professionals. I have liked Arunoday Singh in all his previous ventures but in this he has really acted in a very awkward style and remains completely unconvincing. Arif Zakaria once again gives a seen before performance which fails to impress and Sunny Leone expectedly relies a lot more on her body than her acting skills which was pretty obvious. But still she manages well in her debut venture with her limited facial expressions and stunning beauty. The girl has got the fire to burn the screen but doesn&apos;t get anything to work on from her writer-mentor Mahesh Bhatt. And I seriously doubt that with such an image she would ever get an author backed role in our films.\n\nHonestly speaking, throughout JISM 2 I remained puzzled thinking that can Mahesh Bhatt really write this kind of crap storyline and screenplay? The progression of the film is so lazy and uninteresting that it seriously doesn&apos;t seem to be a Bhatt&apos;s camp movie from any angle other than its sexual scenes. The absurd writing reaches heights when you suddenly hear a vague mention of Cancer towards its end and also the playing of an old Hindi classic song &quot;Woh Subah Kabhi To Aayegi&quot; without any basic purpose. Unarguably Sunny Leone is sure going to learn a lot of essential lessons from her first film itself about how things actually work in our Hindi Film Industry, where the on screen project comes out to be entirely different from what was being projected in those initial interactive sessions.\n\nAs publicized in its promos the Cinematography gracefully adds to the soft-porn feel of the movie along with its OK background score. But another surprise of JISM 2 remains its less inspiring soundtrack despite the presence of Mr. Bhatt, the man with a fine musical ear. Though few songs sound fine as individual tracks but while watching them on the screen in their boring placements, they fail to keep you hooked. \n\nContinuing with Mr. Bhatt&apos;s passion for Pakistani music, Rashk, one of the four music directors in the film, simply ruins a fabulous track originally sung by the legendary Noor Jehan and Reshmawith the words, &quot;Na Dil Dendi Bedardi Nu&quot;.\n\nOverall, JISM 2 is surely one of the weakest movies from the Bhatt camp and maybe the most silly one too. I recently read that after working in it, Sunny Leone was thinking of leaving the porn industry to pursue a dedicated career in Indian films. But after watching it, I would just like to say to her that, please do watch JISM 2 yourself as a movie, before taking your final decision. Because here you are nothing more than a bold girl who has a rare beauty ready to be canned naked without any hassles and who can easily bring in great initials even for a trash film. Hence, I sincerely doubt anyone would be ever able to see beyond that for Sunny Leone in the present scenario of our films.",

Not even worh the Netflix time to watch this.\n\nActors were second rate except for the &quot;Benefactor&quot; who is well known in the movie industry and carries what little life this movie could muster. Too bad his talents is associated with this poor story line. What mega church paid to get this made ?\n\nSave your money and time, not recommended to watch, even for free.",

My response to that is: &quot;Really, would they now?&quot; I believe a bit of research on the subject would do some quite a bit of good. The brothers Grimm -which weren&apos;t the original story tellers of &apos;Rotkaeppchen&apos; as they called it- told folktales, not fairy talesthey were the very first tabloid writers and although their stories all had a grain of truth at the very core, the brothers wrote them to feed into peoples believes, superstitions and prejudice in central Europe in the 1800their tales were often capricious and usually cruel, showing very little moral. It took generations of translations and retelling to soften the originals enough to be considered bedtime stories because the originals would have provoked nightmares in grown man at their time. Does anyone know what the significance is of the name Peter and why he wears black throughout the entire film?? I&apos;d love to read your ideas about that. The film is a nice translationyet another one. And by far closer based on the Grimm brothers vision than the stories we all were told as kids. I did see a bit of parallel to Twilight but only because both, this film and all the Twilight movies were filmed in Vancouver and surely used the same scenery. The Storyline is based on the folktale and (in my opinion) it has been done rather well.",

It&apos;s about Charles Dickens trying to write and get &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; published. So most of the story actually takes place in the fall as he struggles with writers block. It&apos;s more an inspiring story about a creative person struggling to accomplish something worthwhile, and because of the elements of the story he&apos;s writing, it has Christmas elements now. Save it for Christmas 2019, or watch it now. But just watch it!!!",

The film tells how a despotic slumlord and advocate (excellent Peter Ustinov)that has embittered their tenants, mostly Italians, then he is become into a dog as the result of a spell by a hag and cast upon him . But the abandoned dog is picked up by a kid (Pablito Calvo , always dubbed by the same woman) . In order to be back to his human form , he must be loved by someone. In spite of his attempts to be love and to the search to get the affection of any person ,the dog alienates his only friend and must try to redeem himself.\n\nThird film in the trilogy with the child Pablito Calvo and directed by the Hungarian Vadja for Chamartin Production Company . This a sensible and feeling movie full of mirth , drama , humor touches, and enjoyable message based on a screenplay by also Hungarian Istvan Beffekky and adapted by six writers as Ugo Guerra and others . It turns of be an awesome film but inferior to masterpieces ¨The Bait¨and ¨Marcelino Bread and Wine¨ . At the same time the film gives us a nice panorama about Brooklyn life , the citizens , their sacrifices , pities and goodness ; furthermore, men at work , children playing , companionship and various situations happen in the slum&apos;s existence . Its perfect developing resides on superb characters well played by whole casting and the sympathy, simplicity of Pablito Calvo . Special appearance by prestigious Spanish secondaries as the great Jose Isbert , Enrique Diosdado , Isabel De Pomes , Carlos Casaravilla , Julia Caba Alba , Juan De Landa and many others . Musical score by Bruno Canfora responds appropriately to the ambient, originating a careful atmosphere . Precious and luminous cinematography by Enrique Guerner (Vadja&apos;s ordinary) who give us an accurate ambiance of the times is developed . This motion picture is a Co-production Italian-Spanish directed by a Hungarian settled in Spain , well realized by Ladislao Vadja , born in Hungary, he&apos;s author of top-notch movies , such as &apos;The Bait&apos;, and &apos;Cord of prisoners&apos;, and three with Pablito Calvo as &apos;Uncle Jacinto&apos;( with Antonio Vico) , ¨Marcelino Pan Y Vino ¨and this one . In my opinion this is one of the best films to come out of Europe in the decade of the 50s .The picture touched the hearts of numerous spectators around the world . Rating : Above average for its worthwhile mingle of drama , comedy , sentimentalism and good feeling .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Die Nichten der Frau Oberst,&quot; directed by Erwin C. Dietrich and adapted from a novel by Guy de Maupassant, is a 1965 film that embraces its era&apos;s free-love spirit with gusto. It&apos;s a saucy spectacle of a bygone era, delivering a unique blend of soft-core erotica and comedic capers. It&apos;s a film that, while not a masterpiece, offers a delightfully cheeky time capsule of the swinging sixties.\n\nThe film follows the exploits of a group of young women, the nieces of the titular &quot;Frau Oberst,&quot; who find themselves in a series of titillating situations. The plot, at its core, is a series of interconnected vignettes, each bringing our leading ladies into contact with a colorful array of characters, from lecherous uncles to bumbling burglars.\n\nWhat the film lacks in narrative cohesion, it makes up for in energy and enthusiasm. The all-female ensemble brings a playful spirit to their roles, embracing the film&apos;s sensuality with a sense of fun. They are unapologetic in their pursuit of pleasure, and their antics often result in farcical scenarios that border on slapstick.\n\nThe male characters, on the other hand, are largely one-dimensional and serve as little more than objects of desire or comic relief. They are the hapless foils to the women&apos;s mischievous schemes, often finding themselves outwitted and outmaneuvered.\n\nThe film&apos;s aesthetic is a treat for fans of 1960s kitsch, with bold fashion choices and a vibrant color palette. The sets and costumes are lavish, reflecting the era&apos;s embrace of opulence and excess.\n\nHowever, it is the film&apos;s approach to sexuality that is its most defining feature. While the erotic scenes are tame by today&apos;s standards, they were undoubtedly daring for their time. The camera lingers on bare flesh and suggestive scenarios, embracing a newfound freedom in exploring sexual themes.\n\nThat being said, the film does fall short in terms of emotional depth and character development. The focus on physical comedy and titillation leaves little room for exploring the nuances of its characters&apos; motivations or the consequences of their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Die Nichten der Frau Oberst&quot; is a film that embraces its era&apos;s sexual revolution with gusto. It&apos;s a light-hearted, playful romp that delivers on its promise of risqué entertainment. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, it is a fun, frothy diversion that will appeal to fans of vintage erotica and those seeking a cheeky glimpse into the past.\n\nSo, if you&apos;re in the mood for something saucy, retro, and unapologetically cheeky, &quot;Die Nichten der Frau Oberst&quot; is worth a watch. Just don&apos;t expect a deep and meaningful narrative to go with your dose of sixties soft-core!",

This is a true &apos;R&apos; rated picture as it is full of violence which could be seen as a negative. The villains are a now somewhat silly and dated 90&apos;s punk gang. But the film is the right length -- not too long and has near constant action. If the human aspects of the story were developed a little more it would have been even better. As it stands now though it is still one of the better action films out there and worthy of watching just to see the ambitious stunt work. I rate it a 7/10.",

Yes, that sounds like a poor plot and it is, but deep down it looks like they were trying. The budget is low and the special effects are cheap, but Dolph and Gary put in decent performances.\n\nThe movie&apos;s worst sin was to not pit Dolph and Gary Daniels&apos; characters to a fight to the death. That would&apos;ve been awesome.\n\nTo tell you the truth, if you liked &quot;Direct Action&quot; you won&apos;t like &quot;Retrograde&quot;, unless you are a Dolph completist.\n\nFor more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",

That said, it&apos;s also one of the weirdest and most unprofessional vampire films ever made. Nonetheless, its quirky catawampus charms should be highly embraceable to most fans of schizoid cinema. \n\nThe off-kilter story concerns Deafula(a pretty creepy looking aquiline-featured fellow), who is Count Dracula&apos;s son, at large in contemporary America. Bringing deliberate confusion to the story, it also seems that Deafula is actually(I think...?) a college student&apos;s manifest alter-ego of some sort. Nevermind, though...this picture takes plenty of liberties with traditional vampire lore(we witness our bloodsucker casually roaming about in the blaze of the afternoon sun, unless that was just some exquisitely botched day-for-night filming). \n\nFor something as outrageously off-hand and ill-administered as it is, DEAFULA does bear a few small strokes of efficacy...it generally maintains a stylish classic horror affectation(the black/white filming was certainly a thoughtful touch), and it can&apos;t be said that it&apos;s not entirely ORIGINAL. To card-carrying members of the Outre Cinema Club, I&apos;d say DEAFULA is well worth a look...there was clearly a noble intention behind it, and although the finished product is beggarly in many directions, it appeals in a rather askew way."

      "reviewBody": "Well, after waiting 16 years for his next installment,  George has given us &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.  As a Star Wars fan I got what I expected - another chance to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe - a film whose sole purpose is essentially escapism.  But as a movie fan, and judging it as I would any other movie, I frankly feel mildly disappointed.  Any movie that&apos;s made can always be improved upon but I feel that this SHOULD have been better.  Firstly the good points :\n\n1)  The visuals are stunning - a lot of love and hard work has quite obviously gone into the effects and the people involved can quite rightly be proud of their work\n\n2)  All the performances by the main cast were good.  Particularly Natalie Portman and Pernilla August.\n\n3)  The Pod Race was exciting and amusing.\n\n4)  The final sabre duel was quite fantastic : Darth Maul prowling up and down like a caged tiger was a particularly excellent touch - it added real tension and anticipation to the scene.\n\n5)  The music as always was magnificent.  The Star Wars saga would lose much of its charm and intensity without Williams&apos; scores.\n\nAnd now the negatives :\n\n1)  The pacing was too fast in parts!  The first half hour of the film just left me cold - you weren&apos;t led into the story.  You were dumped straight into the action.  On paper I&apos;m sure the first half hour looked fantastic but I found myself sitting in the theatre going - &apos;hey, great special effect shot there!&apos;  I wasn&apos;t involved in the story and the scenes lacked tension and danger.\n\n2)  The film only truly started for me on reaching Tatooine.  I finally got a chance to get to know the characters.  However there still was not enough character development in the film as a whole.  For example,  Obi Wan had nothing to do or say throughout the movie except flash his light sabre around from time-to-time.  Who is Obi Wan???  After seeing the film I&apos;m none the wiser.  And the final sabre duel (good as it was) would have been infinitely better had the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi Wan been explored past the mere mentor-apprentice motif.  The final sabre duel lacked emotional involvement as a consequence.\n\n3)  Why did they make Jar-Jar so incomprehensible??  I found myself becoming annoyed at having to strain to understand his nonsensical utterings! (Having said that, he wasn&apos;t as annoying as I&apos;d been led to expect)  Why George used easily identifiable racial accents for his alien characters completely puzzled me. It just shows a lack of imagination!\n\n4)  Not enough Darth Maul.\n\n5)  What&apos;s with the biological exposition on the Force!  Was that necessary? The first three films pointed to links between the Force and genetics but I don&apos;t need tiresome cold scientific explanations as to the Force&apos;s origin, thank you very much!  It just ruins the mystique.\n\n6)  Can we have less of the mindless gaffes that occur in the final battle scenes (You know the ones that save the day!)  Its an insult to the audience&apos;s intelligence (In a full theatre I swear I didn&apos;t see a single soul who looked under sixteen! - has George forgotten about the original fans).  In the original trilogy there was none of this cringeful embarrassing material (Ewoks excepted!!)\n\nWell I think I&apos;ll stop there.  To summarise : a good movie that could have been a whole lot better.  Perhaps there was too much story to cover in two hours?  In which case the plot should have been shortened on the adage that &quot;less is more&quot;.  I&apos;ve always thought that episode one was always going to be the lamest of the new films so I await the next installment with anticipation and hope .....",

      "reviewBody": "This movie from director Vittoria de Sica is a heartbreaking story of a destitute pensioner named Umberto Ferrari and his pet dog. The pensioner cannot bring himself to tell anyone of his difficult existence or to ask for help. Set in post-war Italy of the 1940&apos;s and 50&apos;s, the neo-realist movies of this period with their on-location shooting show the grinding poverty of many people at the time. With this vivid background, we see some very tender moments in the story that illustrate the bond between the man and his dog. We also get a sense of the mood in Rome at the start as police break up a protest by pensioners fighting for a decent income. Other scenes take the viewer into a hospital where patients recite the Rosary from their beds, have lunch at a pasta diner and go home to a walk-up apartment. With Umberto pitted against his cold-hearted landlady, we see how his life is made almost unbearable. In fact, the movie is very sensitive in its depiction of this man, one of many elderly people who were by themselves with little money. In this case, the elderly man, played by Carlo Battista, has a reason for living because of his canine companion. De Sica used amateur actors and Battista was a university professor in Florence who has captured the essence of his character. De Sica made his mark as the foremost director of the neo-realist school of cinema and as an accomplished character actor in his own right. I noticed the dedication to Umberto DeSica, who was apparently his father. In this film, DeSica has certainly produced an outstanding work of art about the plight of one aged citizen in a particular time and place. Thanks to TCM for its recent showing this neo-realist classic.",

      "reviewBody": "This film has a few things going for it and not much else. It does have an icy female villain well played by one Anne Twomey, who is now known only for her small part as the NBC exec who put the kibosh on Jerry&apos;s sitcom pilot on Seinfeld. It has the sexiness of Tom Berenger and Daphne Zuniga, but doesn&apos;t seem to know what to do with them. And it has brief full-frontal male nudity by an unknown actor at the beginning, worth a look alone since it happens so rarely in American films. \n\nThat&apos;s it. The rest is not good, but it may be fun to watch just to see how convoluted it gets. Plus you keep thinking the main actors are going to bare all, but they never really do. (Zuniga gets some rear shots, but is pretty skillful at arm-placement when facing the camera. If you wanna see more of Berenger, get At Play in the Fields of the Lord instead.) Sorry to keep dwelling on the nudity, but this is not a film you watch for the plot.\n\nRoger Ebert named this as the worst film of 1988 six weeks before the year was up. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s that bad, but it tests your patience. Funny, he ran into Zuniga at Sundance about 13 years later and they exchanged pleasantries. Apparently he was kinder to her in other reviews. She has deserved better, and in fact could be having a Helen Hunt kinda career if she hadn&apos;t been cast in films like this. (Being on Melrose Place probably seemed like a good idea at the time, but not in retrospect.)\n\nYou can decide for yourself if this film is &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; or just bad. Perhaps it might have been a great cheap Cinemax &quot;erotic thriller&quot; with a controversial priest angle, but at face value it&apos;s lame, with a lousy written tough-guy priest character that rings false all the way through it. If you want to see a story about a morally compromised priest, see Linus Roache in the excellent PRIEST, not this. \n\nTo sum up, I was curious about this film, and I&apos;m glad I watched it, but I probably would not watch it again. (Did I just qualify that with a &apos;probably&apos;?)",

He can entertain thousands when he is on the stage with his black shirt and trousers. With minimum investment, no decor, no make up, he generates maximum return in his shows. But when it comes to cinema I think he does not take his business as serious as it should be. It is as if he finds the jokes and starts the movie without any fundamental preparation. He needs professional help in creating a good story, writing a satisfactory script, finding a reasonable team of actors, needs a good cinematographer, editor and director. We expect really good movies from him as he has talent to contribute to a good movie. But he can not do everything by himself, this would be an insult to cinema. If he thinks that he will be successful in cinema so easily I think he is wrong.",

The sadness of the story, written by Paddy Chaeffsky no less, harbors something prophetic. I can&apos;t quite put my finger in it but this was 1958 and talks about things we really start to understand now. I&apos;m writing this review in 2010. John Cromwell (Of Human Bondage) directed, Steven Hill (Law and Order, Lloyd Bridges (Jeff&apos;s and Beau&apos;s dad), Patty Duke (The Miracle Worker) lend extraordinary support.

      "reviewBody": "Ernst Lubtisch&apos;s classic comic statement about Communist Russia, NINOTCHKA, came out in 1939. Whether it &quot;influenced&quot; the production (also by MGM) of COMRADE X or not I could not say. Certainly there are similarities between the comedies. Lubitsch set his comedy in Paris, where a Communist trade mission is living it up, being corrupted by an émigré Russian noble (Melvin Douglas) so he can try to retrieve jewelry that the trade mission is using as collateral. The Russian government does not trust the three men sent, so they send a fiercer ideologue (Greta Garbo in the title role) who starts straightening out the mission, until she falls for Douglas&apos;s charm. In the end she is lured back (with her three associates) to the west and away from the Soviet paradise.\n\nNINOTCHKA had Felix Bressart and Sig Ruman in the cast as two of the members of the trade mission. Comments on this thread point out that in the 1930s &quot;accents&quot; were fairly interchangeable in Hollywood, so that the Swedish Garbo (and later the Austrian Lamarr) became Russian. So did German Ruman and German - Jewish Bressart (who would also play a Hungarian in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER).\n\nUnlike NINOTCHKA, COMRADE X is set inside that nightmare land, Stalinist Russia. Somebody is sending out unofficial (but thoroughly correct) news stories showing the crimes being committed in Russian by the government against the people (i.e. the purges), as well as the idiotic projects and waste mismanagement illustrative of how poorly the government is as effective government. This is being resented by the Presidium, who is represented by Oscar Homlolka (Commissar Vasiliev). Please note that Homolka&apos;s make-up makes him look a tremendous bit like one Joseph Stalin. At a public funeral covered by the press court, someone tries to shoot Vasiliev (who does all he can to hide the assassination plot). Mac Thompson (Clark Gable), the American reporter, manages to snap a photo of an odd site - a bearded man who a moment before the shooting opened up the lid of the coffin and popped out. This bearded gentlemen turns out to be one Michael Bastakoff (Vladimir Sokoloff), a rival of Vasiliev for power. He is made to look a tremendous bit like one Leon Trotsky.\n\nGet the message from Hollywood here? Vasiliev&apos;s agents have been trying to pin down the news leaks, and has narrowed it to two figures: Thompson, and one Emil Von Hofer (Sig Ruman) who is the news representative from Nazi Germany. Ruman manages to demonstrate it ain&apos;t him, so (despite Gable&apos;s breezy denials) Vasiliev believes it is the American.\n\nGable has a close friend in Moscow, one Ygor Yahupitz (Felix Bressart) who is his sometimes valet. Ygor&apos;s daughter is Galubcha (Hedy Lamarr) who is a streetcar operator. Ygor wants Gable to try to smuggle Galubcha out of the Soviet Union into the U.S. And the film shows (among other things, including overcoming Galubcha&apos;s fierce belief in the Communist ideal) Gable eventually saving both the girl and her father.\n\nThe comedy is quite amusing, even if it lacks the style and grace of the Lubitsch touch of the first film. But it certainly comments on the atmosphere within Russia in a way that NINOTCHKA failed to do so. The centering of the comedy in Moscow, the suggestiveness of a Stalin - Trotsky rivalry clone, and the heavy control over information is certainly more realistic than Douglas&apos; being elegant and eloquent about the beauties of Paris.\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind is a scandal which is on target with this film, and which (in 1940) finally began to raise eyebrows. In the early 1930s the New York Times had a reporter named Walter Duranty in Moscow. He turned out to be a fantastically well informed reporter in the Soviet Union, and came out with interviews and articles that were tremendously informative. In fact, he would win the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from Moscow. But as time passed, Duranty&apos;s methods and sources were heavily questioned. He also tended to take an official line about the Purge Trials (i.e., that Bukhanin, Radek, Zinoviev, Tuchochevsky, and the other hundreds and thousands of victims were all actual traitors against the Stalinist regime). After the signing of the non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939, the Times became very suspicious of Duranty, and replaced him. The quality of the articles became very much more even handed. Duranty was later revealed to be a Stalinist agent. Interestingly enough, the Pulitzer Committee has repeatedly rejected requests to take back their award from Duranty&apos;s heirs as his work was pure propaganda. So the issue about the control over the news from Russia was very, very real.",

      "reviewBody": "Dated from 1959 this movie captured the spirit of the time and audience in Central Europe. After the trauma of World War II this region craved for romance and feel-good stories. &quot;Wenn die Glocken hell erklingen&quot; delivered exactly that. Casting the world famous Wiener Saengerknaben as the troop of children going on a holiday camp, lifted the film to a higher level. Their vocals are a delight and the &apos;Panis Angelicus&apos; is executed brilliantly. Criticasters in modern times would say that their singing is not relevant to the story. But this misses the whole point of the movie. It is the story that is irrelevant, as long as it made the audience feel good. The Alpine scenery of the movie is breathtaking, although the acting is average and not above the level of present-day soaps. However, the potential of the actors does shine through. Michael Ande, playing the young boy &apos;Mecki&apos;, went on to a great career in acting as is shown elsewhere here on IMDb. In all, given the fact that it was made low budget and that the movie is certainly outdated, it is nevertheless a worthwhile testimonial of its time.",

And then there&apos;s Ken Russell&apos;s desecrations of Tchaikovksy and Mahler. By comparison this film might have come from another planet, not just a different country. I first saw it 35 years ago, and was delighted to find it as engrossing and moving as it was then. It&apos;s about the music, stupid. But it&apos;s also about how grinding, tedious, and incredibly demanding Bach&apos;s everyday life was, while he wrote and performed some of the greatest creations of the human mind. And also how he was a family man, living an intense domestic life. Yes it&apos;s austere and demanding. But stay with it, it&apos;s worth it.",

John Mclane is now a drunk, he&apos;s separated from his family, living in New York, and to make matters worse a terrorist calling himself &quot;Simon&quot; is out for revenge on Mclane. Mclane, and everyone else, has absolutely no idea why.\n\nThe first 2 films are superior to this one since this has a lot of changes from the mood that made the others so great. First off, it&apos;s not set on Christmas. No biggie though. Secondly, there are too many complications and twists to the plot. You almost have to take notes. And thirdly, the biggest change is that it&apos;s now turned into a buddy movie to the style of Lethal Weapon, since Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus unwillingly teams up with John Mclane. They&apos;re complete opposites, they argue, and they become friends. That sort of stuff.\n\nDie Hard: With A Vengeance still stays true to it&apos;s amazing action scenes, though. There&apos;s plenty of explosions, there&apos;s floods, and overall general destruction. It&apos;s a different kind of movie, yes. But it&apos;s a good different kind of movie.\n\nMy rating: 9/10",

Of his swashbucklers, the &quot;BIG THREE&quot; were always Captain Blood, The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Sea Hawk. But two movies often omitted from a list of his best are The Adventures of Don Juan and The Master of Ballantrae. Don Juan is a movie in the vein of Burt Lancaster&apos;s Crimson Pirate or The Flame and The Arrow, being a tongue-in-cheek swashbuckler that scores on several points. Flynn was clearly comfortable with light comedy; it featured some great &quot;bad guy&quot; work by Robert Douglas; and, despite production problems caused BY Flynn&apos;s excesses, the editing in of sequences from Robin Hood and Elizabeth and Essex worked very well. The fencing scenes were thoroughly enjoyable! All in all, I would recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of the genre.",

I do not recall Duval ever bad, well except maybe his brief turn in To Kill a Mockingbird. I am not enough of a movie buff to be able attribute his performance in this film to Costner&apos;s direction or Duval&apos;s feel for the character. I cannot recall Costner ever playing a role as subtlety as he does in this. I think he understood this character and was willing to share the screen with his costars. I give MS Benning huge props for playing this film without apparent makeup. All credit to Costner for the mood of this movie never wavering. The cinematography was excellent.",

I&apos;m reminded of what Paul McArtney said about John Lennon &quot;If what it takes to have that cerebral genius is to have had his childhood, then I wouldn&apos;t part of it&quot;. He is referring of course to a hard loveless childhood.\n\nWatching this film was sad, revealing of the creative process.  I take umbrage to the Washington Post&apos;s distaste for its Frenchness. We learn so much about Truffaut through the eyes of his friends that we are drawn into his life, like tracing someone footsteps on snow after they are no longer with us. Except, as I am exploring his films, and I compare them to the movies of today, it&apos;s nice to have a small map of intimates. This is one of the best, funniest and incisive documentaries I have seen about a filmmaker.\n\nI appreciate Truffaut&apos;s honesty in his themes: his love of women and the downside of adultery; the open wounds of a troubled youth; the throwing of oneself into an obesessive work to the point of dying young at 52.  All in 93 minutes! Well worth the time and I will probably spend a lifetime fitting the puzzles together. It was like seeing different sides of a New Wave Shakespeare in Paris.",

The plot is solid and intriguing - a story about some of the world&apos;s power-hungry people who want to get their hands on some Godzilla DNA for their own devious purposes. When the Japanese refuse to hand over the DNA, terrorists release Godzilla from his lair and he begins a new spree of terror. In an act of desperation, a scientist merges some of the Godzilla cells with a rosebud, mutating it into the one of the most unique monsters in the Toho universe - Biollante. The two do battle as our protagonists in the film try to track down the terrorists. As a result, what we have is not the usual Godzilla vs. movie with an alien-invasion plot. This one is unique and substantive in its monster origins, plot flow and character development. \n\nWhile an exciting movie, there are some people that this film could have done without, like the horrible Saradian agent SSS9 and the campy Biomajor people. I have to give credit to this movie, anyhow, because it introduced the Godzilla-centered psychic Miki Saegusa (played by Megumi Odaka). She would take a very significant role in this and the following Godzilla films. Her using her psychic powers to locate Godzilla and stopping him from coming ashore in Osaka was intriguing. \n\nOverall, not a bad Godzilla film. Very distinctive, albeit a little too focused on the human subplot and the military, and the Biollante angle wasn&apos;t emphasized enough. \n\nGrade B-",

I have no doubt that legal action was threatened at some stage; this two-reel short tells the now-standard history of the movies from the American perspective, which is pretty odd for a movie produced in Great Britain. There it was well known that several other competing inventors came up with the camera at the same time or even before Edison. However, the producers undoubtedly had hopes of distributing this film in the US, and why tell the Yanks something they would know to be a lie? You might as well tell them that the light bulb was invented by Joseph Swan in 1860.\n\nAs a statement of the standard hagiography of the movies it does a pretty good job, although it departs from that standard as claiming that the talkies hit in 1928. I suspect that the first British movie palace wasn&apos;t wired for sound until that year, so that the important people couldn&apos;t enjoy Al Jolson unless they had seen him in person. How self-centered some people are!",

      "reviewBody": "I had heard about this movie from a friend who knows that I love Thrillers so I decided to rent it and check it out. Butterfly on a Wheel (also known as Shattered) was a pretty decent thriller with a twist that puts the pieces together as far as motive goes followed by another twist which one may or may not see as superfluous and unnecessary. I personally, liked both and this movie satisfied my Thriller needs..\n\nAbby (Bello) and Neil (Butler) Randall are a happily married couple with a young daughter, Sophie. She is a stay at home Mother who wants to recapture her love of photography and he is a successful businessman who seems to be the go to Boss&apos;s man when it comes to sealing deals and landing accounts. The boss has invited Randall on a personal trip and Abby is hopeful that he may offer him partner. Meanwhile, Abby is going out with a friend for the evening and gets a babysitter for Sophie since she and Neil will be gone (him on the trip and she with a friend) - they leave together in the family car.\n\nEverything is fine until out of no where Tom (Brosnan) pops up from the backseat of the car where he had been hiding with a gun and immediately makes it known that Abby and Neil better do what he says and what he wants or else Sophie is dead - implying that the sitter that arrived to care for her is in on the scheme with Tom.\n\nFrom here on out it&apos;s a mind game with Tom making Abby and Neil do countless different things including doing to the bank, withdrawing all their savings and then once Tom gets the money, he sets it all on fire making the audience and the two main characters question his motive even more than before. Who is Tom? What does he want? What&apos;s the motive behind his madness? Who is really in on this plot? Does it have to do with Neil&apos;s business? Is someone jealous of his success?\n\nAll the answers are revealed in the last 30 minutes with an initial twist that puts the pieces together nicely... there IS motive which is always nice to see in a Thriller. However, there is another twist afterwards that was fine but I think the movie could have done without.\n\nMy one gripe was that, despite the 2 main characters having access to phones and often being allowed to roam free through the streets, initially neither contacted the police about their kidnapped daughter. However, the movie implies that Neil and Abby feel that she has been moved to an unknown location (rather than be at the house) which helps since if they contact the police, they may never find her.\n\n7/10 Good Thriller - I&apos;d recommend seeing it."

It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It&apos;s not like today&apos;s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. &quot;Good bye, Maria. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll make a fine nun.&quot;  You want to smack her. Thirdly, it&apos;s got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it&apos;s great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it&apos;s got great music. Fifthy, it&apos;s got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :)"

      "reviewBody": "Maybe Robert Altman needed the change of pace, or maybe it was just because he was in his momentary slump before hitting his stride again with Tanner 88 and Vincent &amp; Theo, but Beyond Therapy is a bewildering effort of farcical cinema. He takes a play by Christopher Durang and &apos;Altman-izes&apos; it, I suppose. There&apos;s the over-lapping dialog, the neurotic personalities, the quirky-cum-insane humor, and the characters that float in and out of scenes like they&apos;re on a mixture of whimsy and mescaline. He also gives some good actors some things to do and funny things to say - sometimes too self-conscious to be funny at all, and sometimes so bizarre that it becomes amusing just to see how far it will go. I couldn&apos;t say I didn&apos;t enjoy watching it all the time, but it would also be unfair to say it&apos;s a complete failure. It&apos;s just a damn odd duck of a movie.\n\nIt concerns patients and therapists, the patients including blind-daters Bruce and Prudence (Goldblum and Haggerty), and their own problems with one another- Bruce is bi-sexual, or bi-curious, or just adventurous, and Prudence is frigid and a little on edge, all the time- and their therapists and people they know. There&apos;s not a whole lot of variety in how the scenes play out: there&apos;s arguments, there&apos;s talking, there&apos;s bedroom farce, behavior tics, and a story resolution that kind of folds back into itself just when it looks to get interesting. Some of the dialog, whether by Durang or Altman or both, can be funny at times, or just with the way a character will react to something (the premature ejaculation material from one of the therapists is funny - at least at first until the joke becomes tired), and some of it just... stinks.\n\nThe actors do try, or at least they try to. It&apos;s hard not to like Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Guest, and in some of the scenes it&apos;s equally fun and painful to see them in this material. Glenda Jackson fares better, or just has her own tune to play, when playing the therapist who hates gays and goes through a letter ala dictionary-style to find a word to say. But some of the acting is just weird, and not in a good way. Julie Haggerty doesn&apos;t deliver anything to make the movie entertaining (frankly I never knew she did anything outside of Airplane! and Midnight Summer&apos;s Sex Comedy, and now I remember why), and what must have been some tighter scenes of sex-farce or screwball comedy on stage have been dissected by Altman, and not successfully. Some of the director&apos;s touches kind of work, though barely, like the constant cutaways to a bald dude in the restaurant (Michael Berryman&apos;s brother, no?) and the slow-motion shoot-out climax becomes impressive just to see how long Altman can maintain it.\n\nBut a lot of this is just ridiculous and stupid and insipid as psycho-sex comedy. Woody Allen could have fared better- or perhaps has fared better- with similar material, and would have, in fact, told a better story. Altman is so fascinated by his warped characters that it&apos;s all that&apos;s there, warped characters. And if we can&apos;t care about any of them, ultimately, even in the scope of crazy satire, why care at all?",

The hair is cursed because the women who had it were victims of organ harvesting. A morgue attendant brings a corpse which still grows hair and sells/gives the extensions. This is where the other part of the film comes in. Hair stylist apprentice Yuko (the pretty Chiaki Kuriyama) lives in a small apartment with a roommate Yuki. She also takes in her niece Mami (a very young girl played effectively by Miki Sato) who is suffering from abuse at the hands of Yuko&apos;s evil half sister. I like the way the film lives in two worlds and comes together. The special effects are pretty good and while there is violence there is little gore. This is a horror film with good production values and Ms. Kuriyama plays Yuko very well, very likable and sensible. If you like horror, especially J horror, you will like this film. While horror is not my favorite genre, I enjoyed this, it moved along well, never dragged and you care about Yuko and Mami. Thats enough of a ringing endorsement, and the film succeeds on many levels.",

Instead of scaring you with the actual Judas Breed man-size insects -created in the first- it relies on it&apos;s plot to creep you out, while taking a totally different approach to the evil of this bizarre &apos;cure&apos; for a childhood disease.  After &apos;Mimic 2&apos; I felt quite wary about this movie, having never even heard one was being made.  It&apos;s just that this plot intrigues me so much, I don&apos;t seem to care if it&apos;s a bad approach or acting (as in part 2; NOT this one -part 3).  I felt pretty good about this movie and it SIMPLY was entertaining, as well as scary in it&apos;s own rite.\n\n7/10 - thank you",

      "reviewBody": "Back in the art-house days, porn and classic foreign cinema coexisted, as a loyal fan base had been established for the risqué movies of Brigitte Bardot and later Ingmar Bergman-directed classics. This odd bird from Switzerland falls into the light porn category.\n\nOnly slightly spiced up by its NYC-lensed racy inserts (flesh but no nudity to speak of), film has modest English-dubbing, but relies heavily on a femme voicing serious narration. The Something Weird Video hack shills for it unmercifully on the back of the video box, promising a low-down and dirty movie, but it is tastefully done.\n\nDocumentary-style in nature, but with actors, THE MOLESTERS covers in detail the various type of perverts who represent a menace to society. The emphasis is on child molesters, with only brief vignettes regarding rape, fetishism (a guy stealing women&apos;s underwear), masochism (we watch NY soft porn star Darlene Bennett wielding her whip) and exhibitionism (film opens with a guy flashing a woman who&apos;s out walking her dog, in a timid bit of footage that is repeated twice later on).\n\nThe first lengthy segment of a young girl kidnapped at a pet store and molested (off-screen) provides an excellent demonstration of police procedural, as every step of the investigation and followup with the suspect is elaborated in minute detail. In both this sequence and later on, closeup photography of evidence, Rohrschach ink blot tests or microscopic visuals are presented in a pink tint, similar to the common tinting done during the Silent Era. This is identified in IMDb and on the video box as color footage, but I suspect it was simply black &amp; white material tinted to set it apart -think of the night scenes in any silent film where tinting was de rigeur to simulate &quot;day for night&quot;.\n\nTwo later segments provide the most dramatic action, moving the film from documentary into familiar fiction genres. One has to do with a boy being molested, climaxing in an effective (if hokey) courtroom drama. The other has a step-father raping his 14-year old daughter, with some fine acting by both of them and mom.\n\nProbably the only segment that strays over the line is an on-screen depiction of a castration operation, as the narrator explains how castration (as opposed to sterilization) lowers the sex drive and is a &quot;recommended&quot; cure to prevent sex offenders from recidivism. This graphic footage, brief as it is, squarely puts THE MOLESTERS into the traditional exploitation genre of birth-of-a-baby blood &amp; guts.\n\nExcellent print quality makes the SWV reissue worthwhile. Coincidentally, the same Swiss production company that made THE MOLESTERS also co-produced (with West Germany) what I&apos;ve always thought was the best movie on the subject of child molesting, IT HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, starring Gert Frobe in one of his best performances. I watched that one on broadcast TV over 40 years ago via a syndication package, and it was very impressive."

      "reviewBody": "Lars von Trier is an unusual director, in that he makes films of massive emotional intensity, and yet also appears interested in formal innovation for its own sake: the Dogme manifesto, of which he was co-author, suggested that films should be made according to certain rules, partly for the expected benefits of following them, but also for the benefits of simply being constrained (a philosophy resembling that of Georges Perec and the Oulipop group of novelists). In some ways, &apos;The Five Obstructions&apos; is both the perfect demonstration of this attitude, and also his strangest film yet. Jorgen Leth is a director who made, in 1967, von Trier&apos;s favourite film, an innovative (but arguably cold) short called &apos;The Perfect Human&apos;; in &apos;The Five Obstructions&apos;, Leth agrees to remake this film in five different ways, subject to constraints imposed by von Trier. The story of his doing so, along with excerpts from all six films, comprises this one. It&apos;s the ultimate recursive project, a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary with itself as both subject and object, an effect enhanced by the way that each film becomes a commentary on, and an extension of, its predecessors. von Trier does not dare, however, to suggest he can improve on the original; on the contrary, he professes to hope that his obstructions will force Leth to make a bad film, and therefore reveal something more of his own emotions than have hitherto been shown. In this, however, he fails. &apos;The Five Obstructions&apos; becomes a film-making masterclass, as Leth continually finds something new to say in spite of the increasing restrictions against him saying anything; his natural inventiveness, and skill, make you want to see the films he has chosen to make for himself. von Trier, by contrast, appears as a fool, although as the resulting documentary is his creation, he is maybe not as foolish as he appears. Indeed, there&apos;s almost certainly an unavoidable level of artifice in the apparently &quot;real&quot; scenes where the two men talk, each are too skilled as film-makers to be wholly unaware of what they are doing. But there does seem to be a real human story, as Leth&apos;s enthusiasm for his task, and for life itself, is driven upwards by the series of apparently insane challenges with which he is encumbered. It&apos;s an odd film for anyone to make, but maybe proves von Trier&apos;s point; for what stands above the contrivance is pure gold.",

Add to the mix a few interesting Sub plots/Diversions-The guy who works as a driver for escorts, the guy with the pink shirt etc, and you have the freshest film to come out of New Zealand since the days of Brain Dead and Once Were Warriors."

It should have been called &quot;Jerry Springer Casting Session with Two Scenes of Courtney Love.&quot;  Like how bored was Nick Broomfield?  I think that he is obsessed with Courtney because he was acting like a stalker and following her around.  I wish she would have gotten ahold of him.  He totally wussed out several times when he could have talked to her and maybe gotten a real answer for his banal and cliched crapumentary.  Instead he just interviewed weirdo after weirdo.  He has nothing better to do than trash Courtney Love and blame her for everything. I think it was very funny to watch all the overdramatic people he found for this movie.  It was like &quot;Waiting For Guffman Part 2&quot;  except &quot;Kurt &amp; Courney&quot; was not intended to be funny and suprisingly no one in the movie worked at a Dairy Queen.  He acts like he is horrified of Courtney and we should all be afraid fo her.  I think the movie clearly showed that she just wants to put the past in the past and move on with her life without some idiots following her around picketing about her dead husband."

I had a sick feeling when Slater started talking into a folding book-light from the dollar store, that maybe this movie was in trouble. Nothing about the plot makes any sense, and nobody reacts in a manner even remotely realistic. Why wear a spacesuit if nobody else needs one in the same area? Why spend valuable time in the middle of a crisis playing with a rock? Why lock-down a room, just to reenter it ever other minute? The movie is a total waste of time. Don&apos;t rent this junk.",

      "reviewBody": "More comedy than kung fu, Winners and Sinners is a crazy Hong Kong caper that follows the antics of a bunch of likable ex-convicts as they become unknowing recipients of a briefcase of missing counterfeit money and some printing platesitems much sought after by two gangs of criminals.\n\nThe first in the &apos;Lucky Stars&apos; movies, this good-natured and silly comedy succeeds in being very entertaining (despite not really being THAT funny) largely thanks to its charismatic cast. Sammo Hung, Richard Ng, Charlie Chin, Jackie Chan, Shui-Fan Fung, John Sham and (token beauty) Cherie Chung all have starring roles, and even Yuen Baio and Lam Ching Ying pop up in cameos.\n\nOf course, how funny you find this film will depend entirely on your sense of humour (let&apos;s say that the laughs are not that sophisticated); the quality of the action, however, cannot be disputed.\n\nJackie has only a couple of brief fight scenes, but truly shines during a roller skating sequence in which he performs some amazing stuntsfirst partaking in a competition, and then pursuing a couple of thieves. And if you&apos;re not gob-smacked when he skates under a moving lorry and then causes a multiple pile-up, then you should give up watching films altogether.\n\nThis being a Sammo Hung film, however, it is the portly one that takes centre stage when the real fighting begins, and fans of his work will not be disappointed. I always find Sammo incredible when he lets feet and fists fly, and in the warehouse-set finale, he delivers some amazing moves. Even if Hong Kong humour is not your cup of tea, Winners and Sinners is worth watching for the end battle alone.",

Either they are nearing the end of their careers or they, too, are just looking to make a buck in a still-recovering US economy. Either way, their talents are wasted in this film. The story, such as it is, has a young man who seems suspiciously related to a string of murders being committed in town. Through a series of tortured plots twists, all intended to bring life to a dull--and by now quite familiar--story line, the movie manages to loose itself in an absurd conclusion.

      "reviewBody": "Rites of Passage is a flawed piece of filmmaking about a college dweeb trying to prove his manhood to his peers by dragging two van loads of his peers plus a professor (played by Stephen Dorff in a nothing role) out on a field trip to his family home in order to observe ancient Indian land on his property and take ancient Indian hallucinogens.\n\nIn the meantime, his disturbed brother (Wes Bentley) is almost as obsessed with finding a woman as he is with Native American history. He, along with his deranged, grieving grounds keeper (Christian Slater), have been cooking, using, and selling the hallucinogenic flowers as well. Of course, it&apos;s bad news when these two unstable characters run up against a bunch of pretty young students, especially when a tragic coincidence turns out to link them in an unexpected way.\n\nThe short review of this movie is that it sucks. Essentially, it&apos;s just an overcomplicated dead teenager movie with an above average cast. In one of the few highlights of the movie, scream queen Brianna Evigan pops up in a smallish part and spends most of her screen time in her underwear. In fact, most of the actresses are either in their underwear or bikinis for most of the movie but there&apos;s no actual nudity. Not much gore, either. And the characters aren&apos;t remotely likable so this is the sort of movie where you&apos;re hoping for everyone to die but disappointed when the death scenes are generic, mostly bloodless and generally forgettable.\n\nRites of Passage is all over the place, silly, and kind of pointless. It&apos;s not really an anti drug movie, it&apos;s not hardly scary, and it&apos;s not often funny. The only entertainment value comes from Christian Slater&apos;s crazy, over-the-top acting as he scrambles around waving a shotgun, muttering to himself, and hallucinating. Basically, imagine Tucker and Dale vs. Evil made without any of the wit.",

Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this movie is the cinematography, designed to look like moving woodcut pictures from old children&apos;s books.  It looks and &quot;works&quot; much better than you&apos;d expect it to. The backgrounds are stylized mattes, the foregrounds are painted to look crosshatched, and stop motion paper cutouts are used to depict objects in a stylized yet consistent way.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.",

And that film was called Ator, and it&apos;s star went by the name of Miles O&apos;Keeffe.\n\nIt was written that O&apos;Keeffe, as Ator, would defeat the evil Spider King and his ten loyal henchmen whilst on a quest to save the woman of his dreams—his sister! Travelling through lawless, cursed lands, accompanied by a blonde tribeswoman and a fearless bear cub, Ator doth battle with slow zombies and blind warriors, explore the Volcano of Shadows to find the Shield of Mordor, and finally defy the wrath of Dakkar, defeat his evil minions, and battle a giant, ancient arachnid.\n\nA predictably dumb barbarian flick from Italian trash director D&apos;amato, Ator, The Fighting Eagle is complete cobblers from start to finish, but oh so entertaining: a welcome appearance from sleaze goddess Laura Gemser, some unbelievably funny fight scenes, and plenty of crappy dialogue make this cheapo fantasy crap difficult to dislike.\n\nI&apos;ve not seen the MST3K version of this film, but it&apos;s hard to believe that anything could be much funnier than Ator, The Fighting Eagle in its original incarnation.",

The films tells the story of two kids trying to re-unit their parents and in order to do so they get lost in the mountains on Christmas Eve. Where everybody would expect cheap action scenes a la &quot;Alaska&quot; the story has much more subtle and romantic approach.\n\nSome sequences even bring up memories of great classics such as &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;. The outdoor scenes in the mountains just blew me away and the acting of the two main characters - the children - is really impressing. The film was realized with love to the detail and I got a good impression how life was a hundred years ago. The film has the potential to become a film classic itself. In any case it&apos;s a brilliant adaption of the novel and good family entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH&apos;: Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) \n\nAn animated sci-fi adventure film about a popular astronaut hero from another planet who becomes trapped on Earth and has to be rescued by his computer nerd brother. The all-star voice cast includes Brendan Fraser, Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, William Shatner, Jessica Alba, Sofia Vergara, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jane Lynch, Craig Robinson, George Lopez, Steve Zahn and Chris Parnell. It&apos;s directed by first time feature film director, and former storyboard artist, Carl Brunker and written by Brunker, Bob Barlen, Tony Leech and Cory Edwards. The animation is colorful and fun to look at and the cast is impressive as well but the story and scene content is pretty simplistic. I liked the monster movie sci-fi send-up though.\n\nScorch Supernova (Fraser) is a popular astronaut superhero, of sorts, on his home planet Baab. He&apos;s looked up to by many there but his brother, Gary (Corddry), is the brains behind their team and he always guides the dimwitted Scorch through his missions, from the BASA base where they work. Gary never gets any of the credit though and even his own son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit) idolizes Scorch. When their boss, Lena (Alba), orders Scorch to travel to the &apos;Dark Planet&apos; (Earth), in response to an SOS there, Gary knows it&apos;s a bad idea (due to the fact that no other alien life form has ever returned from there). He advises Scorch not to go on the mission but Scorch ignores him and the two get in a huge fight when Gary quits. Scorch goes on the mission without his brother&apos;s help, for the first time, and is captured and imprisoned at Area 51. It&apos;s of course up to Gary to save him.\n\nThe animation is beautiful to look at and has a lot of character to it, unfortunately the story doesn&apos;t. It&apos;s about as simplistic and by the numbers as you can get. I like a lot of the actors in this cast (especially Corddry, Gervais and Vergara) but their talents are wasted here. Fraser is perfectly cast as the dimwitted hero, once again, but he&apos;s the only star that really adds anything special to his role (which is funny because he&apos;s arguably the least talented). Like I said the whole Area 51 monster movie send-up is fun but that&apos;s about it. It should please kids but other than some great looking animation and a decent score (including a cool song by Owl City) the film has little else to offer adults.\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n28SgCY6lwc",

Other than the fantastical premise, the story line is realistic and very well acted -- especially by the children, who have the majority of screen time. The villain of the story is just mean enough to be slightly worrisome, but not horribly scary. Describe it as &quot;mild peril&quot;...\n\n... but without the usual &quot;rude humor.&quot; It&apos;s squeaky clean. There&apos;s no impropriety, no smoking, and no swearing, not even milder epithets or name-calling. Even the innuendo common to so many children&apos;s films is absent. Minor misbehavior shows the characters as believable human beings and may (with subtlety) teach something about taking risks.\n\nIt&apos;s light. It&apos;s simple. It&apos;s not really written for adults, but we enjoyed it nonetheless!",

The appeal of the story and characters may a bit more specific german, but the moral and &quot;message&quot; is timeless and is true to all western societies.\n\nComedic film jewels like this are not made anymore - this makes it even less understandable that there is no DVD version around yet.

      "reviewBody": "One of the most politically incorrect films of all time, Pretty Maids All In a Row is easily Roger Vadim&apos;s most audacious film. Scripted by Gene Roddenberry it focuses on the strange happenings taking place at a California high school. To better understand this film, you need to know more about Roger Vadim. He was by all accounts a unrepentant womanizer. He wrote not just one, but two books concerning his love affairs with Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve, Annette Atroyberg, and Jane Fonda. The filmmaker practically invented the modern day sex film in 1956 with And God Ceated Woman. In 2005, Jane Fonda went public with allegations claiming that Vadim forced her to have threesomes with other women. \n\nDirector Roger Vadim obviously loved women. The way the camera takes in the female form in this film shows that this guy truly enjoyed this cast of beautiful high school girls who are dropping out of school in the most unfortunate manner: they are being murdered. The first body is found by student Ponce. He discovers the nude body in the boy&apos;s washroom. After discovering the body we are introduced to the detective assigned to the case as well as an amoral guidance counselor named Tiger (played by Rock Hudson) who also happens to be sleeping with his students in his office.  The investigation goes and we discover that the murdered girls happened to be sleeping with Tiger. Despite of all the heat pressure placed on him, Tiger doesn&apos;t seem worried that he&apos;ll get caught. He continues coaching the football team, eventually setting Ponce up with a sexy new teacher (Angie Dickinson), and of course carrying on affairs with the students.  \n\nIn his autobiography, Vadim recalled the casting of the students in Pretty Maids All in a Row: &quot;...I had auditioned over two hundred boys and about the same number of girls. Most of the girls who applied in the roles of high school alumni were aspiring actresses, though some were local students who merely found the whole thing amusing.&quot; For a man recovering from love sickness (Jane Fonda had just divorced Vadim), this succession of young teenage and college age beauties was intoxicating. Vadim specifically ordered the wardrobe department to dress the girls in micro skirts and tight fitting shirts. Notably, a good portion of them aren&apos;t wearing bras. Vadim films these young ladies, many of which appear to be underage, in a method that is so unapologetically sexual that you&apos;ll soon understand why this film will likely never appear on DVD. With pedophilia being such a hot topic in today&apos;s society, no film company wants to risk being accused of exploiting minors by releasing this on DVD. \n\nWith its nonstop leering shots of teenage body parts and seemingly giddy portrayal of sexual relationships between adults and children, does Pretty Maids All in A Row seem like a celebration of pedophilia? Uh, the correct term is &apos;ebephophilia&apos; which means &apos;love of adolescents&apos;. I guess it&apos;s a matter of opinion. When I first viewed this film as a teen, the director&apos;s constant zooming in on the breasts and buttocks of female high school students was a bit shocking, but had a point to it. I mean, high school is a particularly sexualized place being that many students are entering in relationships for the first times in their lives. Then I read a movie review about how Pretty Maids All in A Row may have been the most widespread female-kiddie-porn film ever seen. The slow, misty shots of the braless pubescent girls in their micro skirts were far too prevalent to be incidental. When I saw this movie again, this time in my late 20s, I had no problem understanding the reviewer&apos;s point of view. For example, the opening scene of this movie consists of a closeup of a pair of butts belonging to two female classmates of Ponce. These two, who look barely 18, show up randomly during this movie, and every scene they are in, the camera is fixated so closely on their mini skirts that it&apos;s laughable. I can find no reason for so pointlessly including these two girls in the movie other than for the director to showcase their gorgeous bodies with series of gratuitous shots of their crotches and rears. It seems all quite juvenille. Still, I don&apos;t think anyone should not see this film just because director Vadim can&apos;t go two minutes without fetishizing a sea of young female bodies. \n\nTo better understand all the blatant voyeurism directed towards these girls, remember that this is an American movie made with a European mentality. The European school of film-making seems to approach the entire feminine image in a different sense than the Americans do; the female body is perceived to be a work of art in itself, that it is graceful, elegant, beautiful and sensual, an aesthetic object with erotic power. Presenting it in the proper manner makes one marvel instead of blushing and turning away--that seems to be the attitude this director takes, and it causes the frequent nudity in the film to be not so much dirty, obscene, and debaucherous, as being instead a presentation of a thing of beauty. \n\nThe acting in Pretty Maids is first-rate. The cast is by far the film&apos;s strongest asset. These are all truly courageous performers, and the acting is so good, it&apos;s scary. The standouts are probably Rock Hudson and John David Carson. Not surprisingly, Telly Savalas as a Kojak-style detective steals every scene he is in. Angie Dickinson is great, but I was distracted by her aesthetic qualities. \n\nPretty Maids is a good movie that has quite a few shocking moments. It&apos;s quite implausible and uneven, but I recommend seeing it. It&apos;s one of those movies where you just HAVE to see it, you know? Not because it&apos;s some great masterpiece of cinema, but because there&apos;s a lot there to talk about. Check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "Exorcist: The Beginning was an ineffective film that contains everything I hate about current genre films: impatient editing and storytelling, lines of dialogue that stop just when some characters are about to actually say something, bombardment of CGI visuals and some seriously unnecessary gore effects that are akin to the movie-makers hitting the audience over the head with a Warner Brothers iron anvil normally reserved for their cartoon characters. What a nice surprise it was to finally see DOMINION on it&apos;s (unfortunate) limited run. Here is a movie that doesn&apos;t assume the audience is too stupid to actually sit down and take a story in without excessive music video stimuli. Here is a movie who&apos;s build-up is effective and will have many working hard to shake the uneasy feeling that, indeed, evil IS everywhere. There were some story elements from &quot;The Beginning&quot; that made no sense whatsoever. In this film - all is presented clearly, thoughtfully and much more unsettling (but it really hits you when the film comes to its climax). There is a scene in &quot;The Beginning&quot; where some crazed hyenas savage a character to shreds. Their appearance was curious and not presented as necessarily crucial to the film other than for one scene. In this film, just one look from them and you know right away they add to the whole atmosphere of the film. They are an ever present danger not only to the surrounding location but the always present evil watching humanity just out of sight and ready to attack when one is most vulnerable and alone. Another sequence featuring Father Merrin and Nazi soldiers is given a very clever, diabolic twist and adds MUCH to the notion of how the Devil deceives and tricks. In the other film, it&apos;s a scene where you know only that &quot;this is what torments Father Merrin&quot; - and that&apos;s it. Which is how this movie plays against Renny Harlin&apos;s &quot;The Beginning&quot; - an easy sell to the masses (it STILL didn&apos;t work). &quot;Dominion&quot; is a crafted piece where one single shot holds more story information than a 30 second sequence rife with vulgar, over-the-top digital effects. See this version - especially if believe that The Exocist story is actually more effective today than it EVER was."

      "reviewBody": "Comedian Harmonists\n\nThe Comedian Harmonists was a wonderful film that I would recommend to anyone who doesn&apos;t mind watching a foreign film. This is a true story about a German musical group of six men. They are a comical group that based their style on a popular American group, the Revelers. The Comedian Harmonists gained their fame and popularity during the time when Hitler came into power. These men were loved by all even the Nazi soldiers, but ironically three of the six men happened to be Jewish. And just like the rest of the Jewish of people during Hitler&apos;s rule, they were not able to continue to lead their normal lives, celebrities or not. You see spectacular scenes in this film were the group performs and you get good examples of the harsh treatment of the Jews by the Nazi. There is a love triangle with in the group that brings out a steady stream of character development. This with the racial segregation makes all of the character come to term with their futures. There was a wonderful performance by the entire cast; I could not imagine any other actors or actress for the roles. The lighting and sound of the movie was good, with great shots to go with them. Overall this is a wonderful film."

I wasn&apos;t sure if I would like this film the first time I saw it, but Paul Walker was still great, as was Tyrese Gibson, playing Roman.\n\nAfter this film, no one was certain about the future of the Fast franchise, not even Vin Diesel. There is a great storyline from this film that gives background on Brian O&apos;Connor and Roman Pearce for future installments. This all culminates in the 2009 film, Fast &amp; Furious.\n\nI have to say, I really liked the jump onto Carter Verone&apos;s (Cole Hauser) yacht, that was really spectacular. I wonder how many takes it took to get that right. And the ejection seats in the car! Ouch! Overall, 2 Fast was not the best of the series, but it was really good nonetheless.",

Here three kids get telekinetic super powers after discovering a strange thing underground. What starts as a bit of fun quickly escalates in catastrophes. The story is easy to follow. It&apos;s different then the usual action heroes that use their powers to fight evil. The actors are all quite young and are not bad.

He insists that the film bears no resemblance to his novel and felt that it was miscast with the exceptions of Downey and James Spader. There really is no argument that Downey as a drug addict was a great piece of casting and this film somewhat foreshadows his downfall in the late 1980s / early 1990s.\n\nHearing the production stories, it&apos;s interesting the film was pulled off at all. New scenes had to be shot, some scenes were cut. It seems like the crew was switched out part-way through. The finished product is far from a masterpiece, but it is still a good film, and has an even better pedigree now (2017) given the success of its main actors.",

If you found &apos;Good Times&apos; and &apos;What&apos;s Happening!&apos; to be stereotypical and buffoonish, you probably won&apos;t like this movie.\n\nIf you are still reading ...\n\nAccording to this movie, African Americans have made numerous advances as a result of the Civil Rights movement. But a powerful Caucasian male known as &apos;The Man&apos;, whose face we never see, wants to put black people back in their place.\n\nWhich is why the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. must stop him.\n\nIf there was such a person as &apos;The Man&apos;, he could have written this movie.\n\nEddie Griffin did quite a good job in what were essentially two roles. Most of the time, he had the giant afro and the cool clothes and the classic Cadillac pumping out funky 70s music as he represented everything good (or bad, depending on your view) about the &apos;blaxploitiation&apos; genre. And he worked undercover as Anton Jackson wearing a suit and acting more white than I do. A very good contrast, showing a lot of acting skill.\n\nBilly Dee Williams nailed the potential presidential candidate obviously based on Colin Powell, who was acting very strange for some reason. Not quite stereotypical, because he was always dignified--but shouldn&apos;t have been. His advertising campaign was hilarious!\n\nDenise Richards and Aunjanue Ellis also gave good performances as the two female partners of Undercover Brother--one when he was black, and one when he was undercover.\n\nChi McBride and Gary Anthony Williams were very funny as two of Undercover Brother&apos;s associates. And Dave Chappelle was very stereotypical, very racist, but very funny--it was just satire, after all. Neil Patrick Harris did quite a good job as the organization&apos;s token white. And let&apos;s not forget the one associate of &apos;The Man&apos; who seemed to want to be black and even acted black at times. That must have been Chris Kattan.\n\nWith all these talented actors, there were of course very clever writers to make the material so hilarious. It takes real talent to produce satire as opposed to just being mean-spirited.\n\nThe music was good too, for this type of movie. I personally would like to have heard Jay-Z do Lawrence Welk. Or maybe not. Today&apos;s artists don&apos;t often sound as good as, say, Rod Stewart. I&apos;m not hopeless, though. I can&apos;t stand Michael Bolton or Celine Dion or, even though he wasn&apos;t mentioned but could have been, Kenny G. For some reason I do like &apos;Jungle Boogie&apos; by Kool and the Gang.\n\nI highly recommend this movie for fans of satire."

      "name": "Something different; Something good",
      "reviewBody": "Now, I&apos;m not going to slap this movie on my Top 10 list or say it deserves an Oscar nod, like many critics have exclaimed, but I will say it&apos;s something different.  First of all, it&apos;s real.  Not an artificial Hollywood shoot &apos;em up or disaster flick.  This is a film about the human struggle. There&apos;s no violence or sex, and if it weren&apos;t for about 7 uses of the &quot;f&quot; word &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; could&apos;ve easily earned a PG-13.  So don&apos;t let the R-rating fool you.\n\nThere are three main reasons why I checked out this movie:  Samuel, L, Jackson.  Needless to say, he&apos;s a terrific actor and worth seeing in whatever he does.  He&apos;s one of my favorites, and he delivers another powerhouse performance, taking on a role somewhat different from his recent roles:  he plays an average Joe.  We&apos;re introduced to his character, Doyle Gibson, who&apos;s a very nice guy simply haunted by mistakes in his past, one being alcoholism, which led to a divorce.  And now he&apos;s attending AA meetings and buying a house for his two kids, hoping he will attain custody of them.  Ben Affleck is good and charismatic.  I didn&apos;t sympathize as much with his character, but that doesn&apos;t make him an antagonist.  Neither characters are saints, nor are they sinners.  That&apos;s good, because it&apos;s never completely effective to include characters who are entirely sympathetic.  They&apos;re both mature adults, but they resort to juvenile acts of revenge in hopes that they can undo what happened.  Sydney Pollack is great, as Affleck&apos;s egotistical father-in-law, proving his talents in front of the camera are just as fine as his talents behind the camera.  I wanted to see more of the beautiful Amanda Peet, but she only has approximately 7 minutes of screen time.  So I&apos;m guessing that topless scene I heard mentioned didn&apos;t make it to the final cut.  Oh, well.  William Hurt, who seems to do a movie every 5 years, unfortunately has a small, thankless role as an alcohol counselor.\n\nThe script is well-written, and the film is a lot more character-driven than ones of recent years.  I loved that scene in the bar where Sam Jackson sits in a lonely bar, listening in on two white guys badmouthing Tiger Woods. He lashes back with a terrific monologue, and later ends up punching them out. Some directors would&apos;ve cut that scene out, overly concerned about the film&apos;s pacing, but I&apos;m glad this time that wasn&apos;t the case.  However, the ending seems a little fake.  It&apos;s just too happy for its own good.  But that&apos;s the only element of the movie I found forced.\n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",

Though it starts out with an interesting concept, Dear Wendy winds its way into a ridiculous hole. The &quot;twists&quot; are random and unfounded, probably there for the sole reason of providing conflict. Also, the movie tends to be sluggish: watching for an hour feels like two or three. On the positive side, the young actors did a very good job (for the most part). At times dramatic pauses cause more laughter than thought, but that&apos;s difficult to avoid with the script. Eye-catching camera angles were used, along with some interesting techniques. To sum up, the director, cinematographer, and actors are probably usually amazing at their jobs; however, if they enjoy their careers they should stay away from writing like this.",

This is where Mark Ruffalos character, a considerate and thought-provoking love-interest, makes an entrance.\n\nThis films moves slowly towards the inevitable end without ever becoming boring. The relationships between the characters are displayed by emotions and subtlety rather than words. The film has a very sad theme but is in many ways very hopeful. It shows that life can trap people down but also that every person has something special which can be used to change lives. I found this film to be warm, unsentimental, thoughtful, sad and uplifting. A bit like life itself.\n\nIf you liked this film as much as I did I can recommend Wilbur wants to kill himself and Before sunset.",

Most people just wish to get on with their lives and have no time for nationalisms or &apos;isms&apos; of other sorts. Indeed, ask the transvestite character in the film, and it&apos;s clear most of us have many of our own problems without taking on the burdens of others onto our own shoulders. \n\nNonetheless, humans cannot be divorced from the realities around them. Hence, the individual who joins a political movement infused with the idealism of youth. Pitted against him is his brother who believes in the power and strength of the state to deliver services, e.g. education and healthcare. As these two fight, innocent farmers and shepherds who happen to live in villages in the battleground suffer. \n\nTo suffer means economic destruction and even death. \n\nThis is the story of one such family caught up in Turkey&apos;s Kurdish insurgency. Simultaneously, the movie reveals the conservative and male dominated nature of rural Turkish society. \n\nIt&apos;s a sad movie - prepared to shed tears. But &apos;I Saw the Sun&apos; is a social statement which provides powerful insights for any student of Turkish society. The movie provides few answers but forces us to ask the right questions. \n\nA must watch for anyone interested in Turkish society. \n\nIn Turkish with English subtitles.",

      "reviewBody": "Crazy, goofy, and silly are the three most operative words to describe &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;. But the movie is also very original. It&apos;s appropriate that the word crazy is in the title because this is the craziest movie I&apos;ve ever seen. &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; is a South African made comedy that was made back in the early 1980s but didn&apos;t get released until 3-4 years after shooting was completed. It became a surprise hit in the U.S. after it was released in 1984, and it did very well in other countries too. &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; features three separate stories that get tied together towards the end. One story is about a bushman who goes on a journey to return a Coke bottle that he found to the Gods after the bottle starts causing harm to some of his family members. Another story revolves around a war that breaks out in Central Africa. And the other story centers around a clumsy scientist who tries to take a pretty South African woman to her new job as a schoolteacher in a small African village, and does everything wrong. This is my favorite part of the movie. The scientist is played by Marius Weyers, and he gives an inspired slapstick comedy performance. Some of the things that he does in the film had me exploding in laughter. The scenes with the jeep that he drives are priceless. Sandra Prinsloo is a good foil as the schoolteacher who unfortuneitly has no choice but to put up with his clumsiness. When Weyers and Prinsloo are on screen, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; is at its funniest. The other two stories are good, but not great. Nevertheless, there are some unusual scenes in these parts of the movie too. But the scenes involving the scientist and the schoolteacher are the best parts of &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;. It&apos;s too bad that they didn&apos;t turn up in the dull sequel. I think these parts of the movie alone is enough for me to recommend &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;. \n\n*** (out of four)",

      "reviewBody": "Aki Kaurismaki&apos;s 1990 film TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTTÖ (The Match Factory Girl) caps a series of three late-1980s films (which Criterion called the &quot;Proletarian Trilogy&quot;) where the Finnish auteur explored the tribulations of lower-class lonely hearts.\n\nThe protagonist of TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTTÖ is Iris (Kati Outinen), a taciturn 20-something who still lives with, and financially supports, her layabout parents (Elina Salo, Esko Nikkari). Iris has no real social life to speak of, being ignored by co-workers and, at her nightly excursions to dance halls, by men. After meeting wealthy businessman Aarne (Vesa Vierikko), she thinks she has found happiness, but is cruelly abandoned by him and then her parents. Though she doesn&apos;t visibly snap, the pressures take their toll, and she ultimately gets her revenge on those who have done her wrong...\n\nAs the film progresses, radio and television in the background report the news of Chinese government forces suppressing the protest in Tiananmen Square. That overt political focus is something rather unusual for Kaurismäki. He has usually included some criticism of state bureaucracy in his films, but here the film is entirely a metaphor for what might happen if the people are held down too hard and too long. Kati Outinen has one of the quirkiest faces in cinema, but here makeup and lighting accentuate those looks and she becomes the very image of misery.\n\nTULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTTÖ fits with Kaurismäki&apos;s general aesthetic in that the film features décor and music from the 1950s, although it is ostensibly set in the present day. His penchant for minimal dialogue here is taken even further than usual. What sets this film apart from the rest of his output, however, is that it lacks his characteristic deadpan humour. Even when he focuses on the underdogs staying under, there&apos;s usually some chuckles in his work. Consequently, I found TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTTÖ often unpleasantly bleak, less enjoyable than his other films. Nonetheless, the streamlined script and careful cinematography make this a film worth seeing at least once.",

      "reviewBody": "Tremendous film.  Even though it lasts twenty minutes or so, you&apos;ll never forget it once you&apos;ve seen it.  Some of the most spectacular live-action battle sequences ever.  The finest collection of kamikaze attack footage out there.  The film is well narrated and masterfully edited, with a powerful, dynamic sound track.  &quot;The Fleet That Came To Stay&quot; was originally released as a war bond drive film in black and white.  I was fortunate enough to inherit a good quality 16mm original print, so am very familiar with it. There are several unforgettable sequences, particularly one scene where a bomb tears loose from a plane making a &quot;deck trap&quot; on an aircraft carrier, bounces along the runway past several groups of military personnel without exploding and finally falls over the edge of the boat.  Unbelievable! The film also mentions staggering &quot;shot down&quot; statistics as part of the narrative.  The final scene before &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;Please buy war bonds...&quot; will burn itself into your memory!  My print is the only one I&apos;ve ever seen; that is, I&apos;ve never come across a VHS video or DVD copy anywhere.   Too bad. It is possible a negative or print may have been preserved in the National Archives.  Check it out if you&apos;re interested in obtaining a copy of this historic film.",

      "reviewBody": "Most French films about war with German army portray it as an army full of stupid soldiers without any intelligence who are not attentive enough to catch French soldiers. French film &quot;Mais où est donc passée la 7ème compagnie » is also a fine example of this tendency. The adventures of the seventh company of French army are extremely hilarious. They are always able to bring immense amount of laughter. One adventure is about how the seventh company manages to escape unhurt when the dead bodies of two German soldiers are lost due to sheer negligence. In a comic yet sensitive member viewers get to observe how some French people deal with less patriotic French folks during times of war. For this section, an ordinary grocer with considerable traces of treachery is taught a good lesson. Gaumont film production company is one of French cinema&apos;s most famous film studios. It was due to its strong backing that French director Robert Lamoureux was able to make three comedy films about war. French cinema&apos;s leading comic actors Jean Lefebvre and Pierre Mondy have starred in all three films. This three part film series began with the making of &quot;Now Where Did the Seventh Company Get to ?&quot; The most unique thing about this film is that it reveals the comical aspects of second world war.",

The broken Hollywood producer Barry &apos;Dutch&apos; Detweiler (William Holden) attends the funeral at her house in Paris and recalls that he might have caused her death.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Dutch traveled to Greece Island of Corfu seeking Fedora out in the Vila Calypso, located in an isolated island owned by the bitter Countess Sobryanski (Hildegard Knef). Fedora has been living an unsocial reclusive life for the last years in the villa with the countess, the plastic surgeon Doctor Vando (José Ferrer) and her assistant Miss Balfour (Frances Sternhagen), since she abandoned the set of a film that she was shooting in London with Michael York.\n\nDutch brings the screenplay with a version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; to offer to Fedora, with the promise that investors would finance the film if Fedora accepts the lead role. Fedora, who is impressively young, is receptive to the offer, but the countess and the doctor tell that she is mentally unstable and paranoid and can not act again. \n\nWhen Dutch discovers that Fedora will be secretly sent to a mental institution owned by Dr. Vando in Mortcert, he tries to rescue the actress from the island but he is hit on the head and faints with a concussion. One week later, when he awakes, he learns that Fedora is dead. Dutch travels to Paris and meets Countess Sobryanski that him the truth about Fedora. \n\n&quot;Fedora&quot; is the swan song of Billy Wilder, with an engaging story; a complex screenplay and many twists about aging, selfishness and loss of youth and identity. The plot has many elements of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, with a washed-up producer looking for a former glamorous Hollywood actress that surprisingly has not aged like she should and might represent his comeback to the glory. The secret about Fedora and her friends is unpredictable. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen hundreds of noirs and this small character study is one of the very best. If Dassin&apos;s simple but heartfelt story of betrayal and redemption doesn&apos;t tug at you hard, you must be made of stone. The acting triumvirate of Conte, Cortez and Cobb has never been better. I get angry just thinking about Cobb&apos;s brilliantly callous performance as the deceptive chiseler who destroys lives to make an extra buck. Cortez is subtle sexuality incarnate but she displays real range and sensitivity as the one who first destroys Conte&apos;s life then ultimately redeems it. The always reliable Conte is absolutely at his best as the desperately driven truck driver who sets out to right a terrible wrong but soon learns that you can&apos;t beat the system. The last shot of the fruit rolling down the hill has to be one of the most evocative and heartbreaking in all of noir.\n\nTiny budgeted movies sometimes suffer in translating reality, but much of HIGHWAY appears to have been shot on location, particularly in the produce warehouses, shoddy back alleys and winding country roads, which adds a ton of authenticity. The story takes about 15 minutes to get going, but from there it delivers amazing power and emotion. For decades it was one of those buried low budget classics almost impossible to find, but thankfully a couple years ago it finally got the DVD release it deserved. Trust me on this one, noir fans... Thieves&apos; Highway is a haunting trip down a rocky road you want to take.",

      "reviewBody": "I first heard of this movie in the spring of 1996.  It surprised me to learn that there was a remake to the 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty which I had recently watched for the 10th time.  I hardly figured that the likes of a slurring Marlon Brando as Fletcher Christian and a cast of personally unfamiliar characters(&quot;who was Trevor Howard&quot;,I asked myself) could top the swashbuckling Clark Gable as Christian and the ripping story that the cast of the 1935 gem pulled off.  How wrong I was to doubt the 1962 Mutiny on the Bounty. I loved it! I do not think that it is better than the 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty, but it stands as a different take.  While the older Mutiny told a by the numbers high-seas adventure with sword fights and glitzy hollywood melodrama, the 1962 version turns out to as less of an action movie and more of a drama.  It chooses to downplay the story more to better concentrate on the surprisly complex characters.  How complex? Take the tormented Mr. Fryer, Captain Bligh&apos;s 3rd in command.  He sees the wrongful treatment that his captain is giving the crew, but he does not want to go against the navy. On the other hand, there is McCoy, the old 30 year veteran--someone who seemly would have experienced cruelty similar to Bligh&apos;s--who mutinied along with the younger members.  Then there is Brown, who ever the gentleman, tries to be loyal to Bligh,but, in the end, he must obey his gentle ways and go against the captain&apos;s harsh methods. Although Mills plays a key role in the film, his character does not hold much mystery; the captain overreacts too much, and he does not think it right. He does something about it.  All of these different characters and more, play off one another beautifully.  When the mutiny does happen, watching them work together(or against each other) is truly beautiful. The production values stir the soul.  The gigantic bounty, the breathtaking location footage of Tahiti, the vast panaramic shots of the Atlantic Ocean, and the loud/proud moody score accented with Tahitian percussion.  The dialogue is quick, clever and too the point.\n\nAll of these elements help to elevate the core story in Mutiny on the Bounty: Bligh and Christian. As Bligh, Trevor Howard changes the character immortalized by Charles Laughten in the 1935 version.  Instead of inhuman, demonic tyrant, Howard portrays Bligh simply as an excruciatingly stern captain focused(a little overzealously) on doing the best job that he can. If his mean do not pursue his goals with the same fervor. He gets impatient then frustrated then angry and then violent all in quick succession.  He makes for a very realistically workaholic without a life, and he wants everyone else to be a workaholic, too. I thought Clark Gable&apos;s Fletcher Christian could not be topped...until I saw Marlon Brando undergo a sheer transformation playing the role. After seeing Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT and the equally American THE GODFATHER, I could not imagine him playing 18th Century British officer...but he did. Brando perfects the haughty, posturing walk.  He perfects the clipped, accented speech.  He perfects the foppish, effeminate walk of a &quot;true&quot; English gentlemen of high-born connections.  Brando does it so remarkably well that one cannot imagine such sissified character leading a mutiny against a tyrannical man like Bligh. Brando&apos;s transformation of Christian from sissy to mutiny leader baffles. Unlike Gable, he doesn&apos;t gloss over the decision to be a mutineer. Gable made it look easy and as the &quot;right thing to do&quot;.  Realistically, is it the right thing to do? To throw away your career that you worked hard for? To throw away your life? All for the sake of a feeling a moral belief? It may sound hard, but when faced with a such a delimma, it can be agonizing...which is exactly what Brando captures to a tee, right down to the last frame.\n\nMutiny on the Boutny 1962 truly needs to be seen.  Please don&apos;t listen to critics.  This movie is fantastic."

He doesn&apos;t succeed. But there is something strange, perhaps the atmosphere, the repression, the sexual hypocrisy of the 50&apos;s that is extremely appealing to a postmodernist viewer. There is something to talk about from the doctoral point of view and it&apos;s the violence of star Laura Hidalgo as well as the warm personality of the then teenager Venezuelan Nestor Zavarce. But most of the characters are stereotypes. However, this movie shows how old studios could sell a product. And how people bought it!",

      "reviewBody": "With the legendary stinker reputation that this Jess Franco fable bestows (together with Jean Rollin&apos;s &apos;Zombie Lake&apos;), I just could help myself to see what all the fuss was about. To tell the truth I was expecting something much, much worse when I got to the end of it, while viewable (think along the lines of a crash car taking place and you simply having trouble taking your eyes off it) I still couldn&apos;t deny just how uninvolved, flat and dull it was despite being compelled.\n\nThis leery zero-budget schlock never captures the premise&apos;s promising idea (where it has Nazi zombies protecting the gold from anyone who enters the oasis in the African desert) and doesn&apos;t go anywhere we haven&apos;t already been before. The lack of money for the production wouldn&apos;t have helped, but the execution is clunky and tame on all fronts for something that needed to be more risqué (no gore or nudity). A repetitively slow-going mess with incoherent story-telling and woodenly wordy script is what comes about. It&apos;s hard to get excited seeing the same lingering zooms, ponderous actions and having to listen to Daniel White&apos;s lousy score of cringe-induced skews being dragged out.\n\nThe ultra-cheap FX work for the threatening zombies (who seem to like to croak and shuffle) look like there done up in scrappy papier-mâché, but it has a decaying quality to it that&apos;s effective. Murky, washed out photography and lack of lighting doesn&apos;t make good use of the exotically bone-dry locations or helping to figure out just when it&apos;s night or day. Atmosphere is non-existent, but there&apos;s one decent creepy image Franco pulls off involving zombie silhouettes&apos; moving down the dunes with the sun setting (or was it rising) in the backdrop and an well-organised explosive war set-piece during the sequence we&apos;re learning about the history of the Oasis and it&apos;s dead protectors. Acting is poor (but there are some stunning women about), and the character&apos;s they play (mainly the college kids) are plain stupid.\n\nA doggedly uneventful zombie film that just manages to hold a spell over you. I don&apos;t know how though?"

Instead, we&apos;re treated to terrible writing the actors can&apos;t disguise and fights which will eventually prompt the viewer to switch to x2 or x4 forward speed as opposed to turning this otherwise steaming pile of turd off.\n\nPlot holes and cartoon-like characters aside (someone else mentioned it was based on a comic, which I suppose explains that aspect at least), there exists the potential for a good, brutal action-drama, but unfortunately, the utterly juvenile and painfully unwatchable delivery of the final output makes it easy to over-look this.\n\nActually, I&apos;d be surprised if most viewers managed to get through this even at x16 speed. A very bad film indeed.",

The film is poorly made to say the least, but it does have plenty of nicely gory old school practical special effects, which I do love. Another fun part of the film is when the teens go to a concert at one point, so you get some nice cheesy 80s music and dancing, all dripping in 80s neon, so it has that going for it too. &quot;Neon Maniacs&quot; isn&apos;t an 80s horror film anyone should seek out, but if you&apos;ve already seen them everything halfway decent and are trying to find something you haven&apos;t seen before, it&apos;s worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "Chemistry so hot that they ignite the screen. Too bad it didn&apos;t ignite the Box Office, but Out Of Sight is one movie both George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez can feel damn proud of. Maybe it&apos;s the fact that George&apos;s criminal character is *actually* funny and multi-dimensional. Maybe it&apos;s the fact that the storyline actually has a story to it - and an interesting one at that. Hell - maybe it&apos;s just that J.Lo walks around in skimpy outfits - curves flaunted - and likes to kick butt. After much consideration, I must concur: it&apos;s equal parts to all 3.\n\nStrong performances by Clooney (Jack) and Lopez (Karen), as well as George&apos;s Ocean&apos;s 11 co-star Don Cheadle. Witty script and likeable characters with a satisfying and plot-twisting ending. What more can you want? Did I hear you say Jennifer Lopez naked? Yeah well, you won&apos;t get that here... but it&apos;s good all the same!"

      "reviewBody": "In the days before the yoke of political correctness enslaved western Europe and the USA, there were many films calling into question political parties, affairs, régimes etc. This is one of those films, an acid &quot;satirical comedy&quot; on life in Paris under a hypothetical Chinese occupation of that city. In the end, the Chinese are obliged to leave because the French have led them down the sinister paths of over-fornication, over-eating and over-womanizing. The film is above all a satire of the collaboration of the French with the Nazi occupants in Paris during WW2. We see fair-weather friends, the resistance who does an about turn, those who get rich at the expense of everyone else etc, the clergy who turn a blind eye to the occupant etc. Everyone is attacked in this joyous satire. The Chinese make their headquarters in the Galeries Lafayette, an important and beautiful department store, many other buildings are requisitioned. Jacques François is the obsequious &quot;Mediator&quot; on problems between the Chinese and the French. Michel Serrault plays the ugliest rôle of the lot, the worst species of collaborator. Jean Yann who is the main star of the film converts his Notre Dame Sex Shop into a Notre Dame Chop Suey and gets rich at the expense of everyone else. At the time of the liberation of Paris in World War 2, women who had been suspected of &quot;horizontal collaboration&quot;, i.e. fornicating with the Nazis, had their heads shaved in public - we see that in this film too. The film is overlong for my tastes and there is a rather soporific Opera spectacle which wasted a good few minutes. Nevertheless it has the merit of having been made and seen by the French public. I happened to be in France in 1974 when the film came out and remember all sorts of protests about it by the Chinese population in France !! It would&apos;t be possible to bring out such a film now as it would be attacked as being racist or some other similar rubbish. It has just been issued on DVD here as part of the &quot;Jean Yanne Collection&quot; and the picture quality is so good that you would think it had only been made yesterday."

      "reviewBody": "With a plot that&apos;s lifted a great deal from The Omega Man, Absolon is a decent science fiction film about a post apocalyptic world where our lack of concern for the environment has nearly wiped the world out with a virus.\n\nSaid virus was said to be lurking beneath the Amazon rain forest which we completely wiped out and it in turn did a job of humankind. Those that survive depend for their survival on a drug called Absolon. Like AZT with AIDs, the drug inhibits the virus, but affects no cure.\n\nOne thing that this crisis has caused is a collapse of all governments in the world. We&apos;ve finally achieved one world because there aren&apos;t enough of us to worry about racial or religious or language differences. What is now society is just haves and have nots, haves being defined as those who have access to as much Absolon as the need.\n\nLocal cop Christopher Lambert is put on a case involving the killing of a scientist who was on the track of a cure, The world police is also interested, but when Lambert starts asking too many questions especially after the case appears solved, they get nervous. Real nervous because their head cop, Lou Diamond Phillips tries to kill Lambert and he&apos;s on the run with scientist Kelly Brook.\n\nThe film moves along at a nice pace and quite frankly I&apos;m surprised no one has seen the parallels in this film with the current AIDS crisis. There is another good performance in this by Ron Perlman, better known now as Hellboy, who is the industrialist controlling the supply of Absolon. He is one evil dude.\n\nIt&apos;s not a great film, but I don&apos;t think Absolon quite warranted the trashing it got from some reviewers.",

      "reviewBody": "Amid the releases of numerous Hammer films, Jack Clayton directed a different kind of horror film, more of a psychological thriller. &quot;The Innocents&quot; casts Deborah Kerr as Miss Giddens, a woman hired to be a governess for two children in a manor in the English countryside. At first, the children are happy to have Miss Giddens around. But as time passes, Miss Giddens begins to suspect that something is not quite right...or is it all in her mind? The movie, based on a short story by Henry James, has a lot going for it. The black and white cinematography alone creates a significant Gothic feeling. The setting certainly adds to that: an antiquated mansion in which just about anything could be hiding; the house could easily be the star of the movie. But Deborah Kerr&apos;s facial expressions are as creepy as anything that happens in or around the house. Her expressions truly serve to make the audience wonder how much of the terror is real or in her mind. And of course the girl&apos;s song is also pretty sinister.\n\nWatching the movie, I could see some similarities to &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;The Others&quot;. It just goes to show that real horror comes not from blood and guts, but from what the viewer doesn&apos;t know. There were a few scenes in this movie that made my blood freeze a little bit. Without a doubt it was a solid achievement for Clayton, Kerr, and also Truman Capote (who co-wrote the screenplay). Definitely one that I recommend.",

Music is not quite appropriate. It doesn&apos;t help enough, it&apos;s too subtle. Acting is good. May be not superb, but good enough to believe in characters. I suppose the main guilt for film being not excellent lies on director. For example, the scene with &apos;Ode to Joy&apos; must have been made more dramatic, the acting there was (or could be) very good, so, the problem is in directing. May be my expectations were not right and the idea was to make one feel the ordinariness of evil. Nonetheless I want something more than just depiction of historical evil. And I see no answers, even no honestly stated questions. May be, though, my willing to get that questions is a good result of watching the film?",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen a lot of weird things on IMDb, but the rating for The Space Children is as puzzling to me as any I&apos;ve run across. 2.1?!?! I couldn&apos;t disagree any more. 2.1 is getting close to Manos territory. The Space Children may not be the best movie I&apos;ve ever seen, but it doesn&apos;t deserve a 2.1. Why the low rating? I blame MST3K. I enjoy the show, but as I&apos;ve argued any number of times, some of the movies that they lampooned didn&apos;t deserve it. Take a look at the reviews on IMDb. You can split them into two wildly divergent groups - those users who appear to only know The Space Children because of MST3K and those who have seen it on its own. The comments from the MST3K crowd always seem to mention Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan) in a bathing suit as if it&apos;s one of the most important moments in the film. In contrast, many of the comments from non-MST3K viewers reminisce about seeing The Space Children during their childhood. Maybe it&apos;s not just an MST3K thing but an overall generational thing as well. Whatever, I tend to side with those who enjoy the movie for what it is.\n\nAnd what is it? The Space Children is a nice little cautionary 50s sci-fi film that speaks to the dangers of nuclear proliferation. Jack Arnold, one of the best genre directors of the 50s, does his usual workmanlike job with the movie. It&apos;s not flashy, but it certainly looks good. The Space Children obviously was made on a limited budget. As a result, the special effects are also limited and Arnold focuses more on the people. A lot of what happens is implied. But that&apos;s not necessarily a weakness. Too often, low-budget sci-fi films from this period look ridiculous because of the desire for elaborate special effects (i.e. monster and aliens) that outstripped the funding it would require. The acting, while not outstanding, is solid. Even the kids, who can be annoying at times in this kind of movie, come off looking pretty good. The cast will be familiar to many who grew up watching television in the 60s. Overall I&apos;ve got no big complaints with The Space Children. Not a bad way to spend just over an hour.",

If you are under 60 and don&apos;t care about &quot;just a Tarzan film&quot; you can forget it but for me it was a dream come true that I never thought I&apos;d see.  Silent so you can add your own Tarzan yell.  That is a chance for self-expression."

So you end up watching these girls and boys take drugs, drink and of course have lot&apos;s of sex.\n\nI think I counted 6 sex scenes, placed around the movie, so whenever the viewers think about turning of the film or walking out of the theater, they think that the sex scenes will capture your attention. And for many, it does exactly that. Teens having sex in the toilet of nightclubs.\n\nIf you are looking for a good film, look somewhere else. if you want to see teens have sex, well... try porn or this film.",

      "reviewBody": "David Carradine stars as Colonel James Cooper, taken prisoner during the Vietnam War. Since he is the highest ranking officer in the custody of the Vietnamese army, they intend to make an example out of him. But the camp commander, Captain Vinh (Mako), offers him a deal: Vinh wants to use the booty he&apos;s stolen from his prisoners to build a new life in America, and offers to take Cooper with him when he makes an escape. But Cooper is a strict believer in the &quot;no man left behind&quot; policy, and won&apos;t agree unless the other prisoners in the camp can come with him. Vinh reluctantly agrees, and so the big escape journey begins.\n\n&quot;P.O.W. The Escape&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, mostly foregoes politics in order to concentrate mainly on action. And, as directed by Gideon Amir, it delivers many thrills - explosions, gunfights, stunts, a major set piece on a river, you name it. It&apos;s actually pretty entertaining for what it is. It amusingly turns Carradine into a Chuck Norris / Sylvester Stallone kind of hero, the kind of guy who energetically takes on all comers while rarely sustaining much physical damage himself. Therefore, it&apos;s NOT something to really take seriously. With the Philippines once again standing in for Vietnam, there&apos;s much excellent location work, and a certain degree of atmosphere. That&apos;s not to mention the omnipresent soundtrack, which is mostly a collection of cues taken from previous Cannon Group productions.\n\nCarradine is a true study in no-nonsense, all-business stoicism here, with strong support from a rock-solid Steve James, one of the most charismatic second bananas to ever grace cinema with his presence. There&apos;s also some delicious villainy from Mako, jovial and smiling at first, but deadly serious when he needs to be. To add to the tension, there&apos;s antagonism from a Jerk soldier named Sparks (Charles Grant), who&apos;s as self-serving a character as you&apos;re ever likely to see. Other familiar faces like Phil Brock, Tony Pierce, and Ken Metcalfe have supporting roles and bits.\n\n&quot;P.O.W. The Escape&quot; will not be for viewers expecting realism or historical accuracy. It&apos;s just a straightforward little diversion that holds viewer attention for a well-paced hour and a half.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

I think this movie ranks no.1 in Comedy genre of Bollywood(at least in 1990s when there were very few comedy movies)."

      "reviewBody": "If the one-sentence synopsis, &quot;A sickly teenager wishes more than anything to be allowed to perform in the school play,&quot; doesn&apos;t grab you, don&apos;t pay it any attention. Watch Cynthia anyway. It&apos;s a delightful gem from Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s younger days, even earlier than Little Women! And speaking of Little Women, Mary Astor plays Liz&apos;s mother in this film as well. George Murphy plays her father, and S.Z. Sakall rounds out the cast as the school&apos;s lovable theater director.\n\nAt the start of the film, Mary and George are shown young and in love, and their adorable romance quickly blossoms into marriage. They have grand plans to live in Vienna and study music and medicine, but when Mary gets pregnant, their plans go on hold temporarily. Fifteen years later, they&apos;re stuck in the same small town, renting a house they can&apos;t afford, struggling to pay their daughter&apos;s outrageous doctor&apos;s bills on a one-income salary from George&apos;s work in a hardware store. The parents&apos; part of the film is actually quite sad, as you feel their disappointment as well as their guilt whenever they resent their lost dreams. Both George and Mary give wonderful performances.\n\nBecause George and Mary are so three-dimensional, it&apos;s difficult to call Liz the gem of the film, but she really is. She&apos;s so delightful, innocent, charming, passionate, and frail, culminating in such a captivating performance it&apos;s absolutely impossible not to love her. And since it&apos;s so impossible not to love her, you understand why George bows and scrapes to his boss as well as his brother-in-law, the greedy Gene Lockhart who treats Liz during her countless illnesses. You understand every part of Mary&apos;s behavior, as she embodies every mother&apos;s journey in raising a teenaged daughter. In one scene, Liz comes home from her first date. Mary wants to revel in her daughter&apos;s happiness, but she also tries to instill responsibility, like taking better care of her dress or soaking in a hot bath so she won&apos;t catch cold.\n\nEvery part of this movie is a joy to watch, from the cute to the tragic. You&apos;ll reach for your handkerchief from time to time, and if you watch this with your kids or parents, you&apos;ll cry even more. Everyone gives strong performances, and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find your favorite moments as I have. At the heart of it all is Elizabeth Taylor, so beautiful and yet so innocent and fresh, even though it&apos;s impossible she ever felt what her character went through in real life. How could the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor know what it felt like to be ignored by all the boys in school, and then the thrilling joy at being allowed to go to her first dance? It&apos;s called acting, and she does it beautifully.",

Don&apos;t you mind that; think of this as another in the genre of movies that start out being simple stories and turn into movies about movies, not by digging deeper in the layer but by bringing the original movie into &quot;reality.&quot;\n\nThis one really impressed me with the cleverness of its construction; it unfolded in completely novel and unexpected ways. The thing is anchored in the movie by Holly Hunter and in the show within by Holly&apos;s character. Holly has done this kind of folded acting before — &quot;Timecode&quot; comes to mind. She does it rudely; that&apos;s just her style.\n\nIf you want to make an engaging movie these days, you have to engineer a means to get the audience into the story. The easiest way to do that is to create an audience as part of the story, then trick the movie audience to fold into the story&apos;s audience. \n\nWhether you like the &quot;message&quot; or not, I recommend this as a crack piece of screen writing. In nearly all movies, the story isn&apos;t important anyway. Only the means for telling the story matters. This is a clean form. See it.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Basically, the deal is this: Aerosmith has appeared on Columbia and Geffen records; Geffen put out &quot;Things that go pump in the night&quot; a better video not to be confused with this one. This was Columbia&apos;s attempt to compete in the video market during a big album for Aerosmith. Also, because Columbia doesn&apos;t own the rights to the songs on Pump, all the song clips are studio-out takes or production stuff because of a loophole where performed material doesn&apos;t really violate copyrights on competing labels. Anywho, this should basically be reserved to die-hard Aerosmith fans like myself. There is interesting conversation, but not too much happening. No offense to Aerosmith, but don&apos;t get this one until you own most of the other Aerosmith videos. Definitely better Aerosmith videos out there: Big Ones you can look at is the best, then something like Video Scrapbook, Texxas Jam &apos;78 (good set list), then Things that Go pump in the night, then Making of Pump, then Permanent Vacation 3x5. That&apos;s my ranking for the Aerosmith videos, anyway. Of course, I love them all, but I&apos;m just looking at for potential fans who naturally want to start with the best videos. Rock on!",

The animation was pretty decent and in some ways was better than more mainstream films. I thought the voice cast could have been slightly better, though strong they needed to sound more like what a talking animal would sound like. I&apos;ll give it big plus points for not including a bloody rap song and I thought overall it was a decent family animation.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the most controversial films ever made, Mission To Moscow was not good for anyone&apos;s career who got involved with the making. Like Song Of Russia made over at MGM, Mission To Moscow was a film made specifically to improve Soviet-American relations in facing the common enemy they had.\n\nThe Soviet Union no matter how much the American Communist Party trumpeted their virtues, still had a real image problem in a lot of quarters due to the purges that Joseph Stalin conducted, due to the tremendous dislocation his five year plans created, due to the misery caused by the collectivization of agriculture and the systematic slaughter of Kulaks. Kulaks roughly translated could be anyone who owned a large estate to someone who might own a slightly bigger piece of land and maybe some farm animals. Stalin slaughtered thousands of them to force collectivization.\n\nOur first ambassador to the Soviet Union was William C. Bullitt who was sent there in 1933. The Republican post World War I presidents did not diplomatically recognize the Soviet Union, Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s first foreign policy initiative was to extend recognition. Bullitt was a guy at first enthused, but then got very disillusioned by what he saw. He and FDR had a falling out and he left Moscow in 1936.\n\nJoseph E. Davies was an industrialist and large Democratic contributor who did go back with FDR to the Wilson administration. He was appointed US Ambassador and after that became a cheerleader for the Soviets. As is shown in the film, Davies just blindly accepted every piece of propaganda handed to him. Films made in 1943 were not going to cast a critical light on the dark underside of Communist Russia.\n\nWalter Huston dusts off his Sam Dodsworth persona to play Ambassador Davies. Ann Harding plays his dutiful wife and Eleanor Parker their daughter. Vladimir Sokoloff is President Kalinin, Gene Lockhart plays Prime Minister Molotov and Oscar Homolka plays Foreign Minister Litvinov all well known personalities of the day. In the Soviet Union like other countries Davies would have been required to present his credentials to the president and Russia did have a figurehead president who was a great deal less than Mission To Moscow makes him out.\n\nAt that time Joseph Stalin was only the Secretary of the Presidium of the Communist Party, but as such wielded the real power. The People&apos;s Republic of China adopted a similar set up that never changed with Mao Tse-tung as Party head and holding the real power while Mao lived. \n\nStalin is played by actor Manart Kippen and is only seen once as Davies is prepared to leave the Russian embassy. He&apos;s so shy and retiring the portrayal is so absolutely ludicrous that it leaves me laughing. But Davies sitting through the purge trials and accepting without question all the testimonies and forced confessions is also ludicrous.\n\nAfter his time was up as Ambassador, Davies wrote the book on which this film was based and did go on a speaking tour promoting Russo-American cooperation. He was doing this on behalf of his friend and president FDR, but Davies had also become a real true believer in the &apos;miracle&apos; that was Soviet Russia. \n\nWhen the Cold War started three films became the targets of the House Un American Activities Committee, they were ripe targets that the conservative members were grateful for. The three films were The North Star from 20th Century Fox, Song Of Russia from MGM, and Mission To Moscow. None got more criticism than this one. Screenwriter Howard Koch who had won an Oscar this same year for Casablanca, earned a place on the blacklist because of Mission To Moscow. Whatever Koch&apos;s personal political convictions were, in this case all he did was translate to the screen what was in Davies&apos;s book.\n\nDavies was held up to ridicule and in some measure deserved a bit of it because of Mission To Moscow. Time and the end of the Cold War have given us a proper perspective of the Russian contribution towards defeating the Nazis. In fact it was the lion&apos;s share in Europe. Policy decisions were made on the basis of keeping the Russians in the war before the Americans and British and respective allies got on the European continent with forces to make it a two front war, first in Italy and then in France. There was a justifiable fear that Stalin would make a separate peace with Hitler just as he signed the non-aggression pact with him before World War II started in 1939.\n\nOf course the reports that Davies wrote off about the brutality of the Soviet Union were also true. The reactionaries had a field day with him, he was never taken seriously again. For that reason Mission To Moscow has not worn well either as history or entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a beautiful, well-done movie and it&apos;s very very clear that the only reason it has a low rating is because a bunch of atheists/ anti-Christian extremists/ just plain a-holes decided to give it 1 star without even seeing the movie. Trust me, that&apos;s the only reason... and they are only making themselves look pathetic because there is only three pages of reviews, all but one of which are extremely good (in the 7-10 range), yet there is a 4 point something average. What does that tell us? That obviously all of the low ratings don&apos;t even have written reviews, they are simply votes. Therefore, no one has any logical support to back up there reason for a 1 star rating, probably because they haven&apos;t even SEEN the movie they just decide &quot;hey, what I believe is right and I don&apos;t believe there is a God so I&apos;m just going to lowly rate this in some attempt to demean or put down all who do believe in him.&quot; People are so stupid and you just can&apos;t trust what you see nowadays.\n\nI&apos;m not even a Christian and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. \n\nPeople need to stop being so narrow-minded and cold hearted and just let people believe what they want to believe. You can&apos;t prove to someone they&apos;re wrong. Most Christians don&apos;t try to prove anything to non-Christians, we let it go that a lot of the world doesn&apos;t believe in God. That&apos;s totally fine. So why can&apos;t you just let it go that a lot of other people in the world do believe in God? That&apos;s totally fine, too. You all need to open up your minds and stop being so utterly immature. Damn.",

He then gets a chance to revitalise his career; and doesn&apos;t take it. I spent most of this film wondering when something was going to happen; in fact, almost nothing does, beyond what is predicted by the premise. Although there is sexual contact, the film can be thought of as a French equivalent of &apos;Lost in Translation&apos;, although without that film&apos;s annoying sense of self-reverence and faux-profundity. It makes good use of the singer&apos;s repertoire which serves as both soundtrack and commentary, the performances are nicely judged, and at the end, in spite of the absence of obvious content, I found myself oddly moved.",

Not so with the six forlorn refugees of &quot;The Boat is Full.&quot; Having reached Switzerland after a perilous escape from Nazi Germany, their ordeal has just begun. They end up in a small village where an innkeeper couple take them in and try their best to provide food, clothing, shelter, and protection from the authorities.\n\nThe movie examines the attitudes of the Swiss towards refugees who were escaping Germany and seeking safety in their country. It provides a good insight not only into the official policies regarding which refugees were allowed to stay and which were forced to be repatriated, but also the attitudes of the common people. Some were openly hateful, most were indifferent and callous, many genuinely compassionate and kind.\n\nThe overall arc of the story is less important with this movie than the individual scenes and episodes that take place. Each conveys a particular pathos and engraves itself in one&apos;s memory with indelible force. The acting is almost totally transparent: you feel these are real people going through real events. The refugees&apos; blank, despondent expressions, the gradual transformation of the innkeeper husband from suspicion to tolerance to outright kindness, the harsh authoritarian attitudes of the policeman, these all contribute to the film&apos;s effect. \n\nIt&apos;s a stark film to watch: there is no score, the colors are heavily muted and drab, and there are few points of comfort or cheer. One is left with a profoundly ambivalent view of the Swiss and Switzerland, which apparently was known as the &quot;lifeboat&quot; of central Europe (hence the irony in the title). The film is basically examining where the line could/should have been drawn between compassion and the need to maintain Swiss neutrality and protect its own borders and feed its people.",

      "reviewBody": "The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley&apos;s novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy) , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary Jaws I,II) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then, an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.\n\nIt&apos;s an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws, except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to ¨Revenge of the creature¨(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to ¨Back to the future¨) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves, producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by Jeannot Swarc,Joe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel, a real turkey. Only for theaters, its real asset are the 3D digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities.",

If it has one defect, it&apos;s the end, that left me unsatisfied, even if as we all know most of the mysteries unveiled lose their power.\n\nBut there is one thing that is worth: the atmosphere, that is really Gothic. The characters are isolated in a forgotten manor, they move slowly, talk slowly, and web you in an enticement of stillness. The only rumors are the constant blowing of the wind and the screech of dust under their feet. (Audio is of the essence for this movie.)\n\nIn conclusion, this is worth renting the tape, provided you see it in silent and darkness."

      "reviewBody": "The original Russian version with subtitles is one you should consider watching than the English dubbed version of Sadko called the &apos;&apos;magic voyage of Sinbad&apos;&apos;. Not to say the English version is not worth watching but how can one make more of a masterpiece when it is already an acclaimed masterpiece and doesn&apos;t need any salt and pepper (re-dubbed &amp; re-cut) to spice it up. The result can be devastating if you&apos;ve already seen the original (Sadko 1952).\n\nThere are good and bad comments about this film, thanks to the re-dubbed version. I&apos;m sure everyone that has seen the original version (sadko) will give it at least an 8 out of 10.\n\nSomeone made a comment that the film is goofy because Sinbad wasn&apos;t wet when he visited the great kingdom at the bottom of the sea and how did he manage to hold his breath that long. Well... the film is a fairy tale, not a documentary or reality show...nothing is real and it would have looked goofy if they were wet. As a matter of fact the underwater scenes are a feast for the eyes and a big step in special effects during its time (1952). This film should be treated with more respect. I&apos;m sure if these critics see the original(sadko 1952), their views will be totally different. And I think &apos;&apos;the magic voyage of sinbad&apos;&apos; should not be credited with &apos;&apos;SADKO&apos;&apos;. Little is known about sadko while magic voyage of sinbad was well advertised 10 years later. That explains the reason why sadko suffers the bitterness of its good for nothing sequel, magic voyage of sinbad 1962. Like I said, &apos;&apos;SADKO 1952&apos;&apos; is a classic and a masterpiece nothing more or less.",

Filmmaker Brian DePalma once again goes to the Hitchcockian well one time too often in this dreadfully listless and incredibly pedestrian thriller&apos; about a bad French girl (Romijn-Stamos doing a killer Sharon Stone cum Grace Kelly turn) whose identity as a criminal threatens to be usurped when she attempts a change in life by marrying a wealthy American diplomat  and photographer Banderas (in one of his worst displays of acting) as the patsy she becomes embroiled with involving murder, blackmail and mistaken identity.  Too much of a thinly veiled attempt by DePalma to breathe fresh life into a long-gone corpse: the erotic mystery via travelogue despite his pulling out all the stops (vertigo inducing cinematography, split-screens, etc.) that he has been notorious for.  Boring and tedious in its theatricality; a real shame from a master auteur."

      "reviewBody": "A Fantastic Movie from start to finish, with brilliant acting, script, dialogue, poignancy and laughs. Danny Dyer proves that there is more to young British Actors that Jude &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Law and Orlando &quot;acts with his eyes&quot; Bloom with a stirring performance as Tommy Johnston. The social critique is as prominent in the film as the football hooliganism, and the bathos that runs throughout is definitely a strong point. The Film is similar to Trainspotting in its feel and story-telling style, and the soundtrack expertly tries to give you the buzz the guys are feeling as they are marching towards a ruck. Scenes to look out for are the Junior Football Match, the 3rd Round Draw, and Rod Meeting his girlfriend&apos;s parents. Ultimately the film asks more questions about the society that breeds the need for arranged violence than the actual link to football, and ultimately leaves you on a high note after many lows during the film.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone, not just football fans, but anyone who wishes to see a film out heterosexual male relationships, and the state of the British Male mindset in the year 2004.\n\nLove It!!"

Imagine a combination of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Pineapple Express, with some Steve Carell-style comedy mixed in. It&apos;s not similar in story to either of those movies, but it does manage to blend action and comedy together in a comparable way.\n\nThe casting is perfect, and really what makes Get Smart so likable. There is a pretty amazing group of actors gathered here, especially considering the fact that these kinds of films do not often attract A-list talent. Everyone seemed like they were having fun and enjoying their roles, and it shows in their acting.\n\nGet Smart has a basic spy-type plot that certainly won&apos;t be winning any awards for originality. At the same time, I never though the fairly typical story was detracting from the movie. You&apos;re probably not watching this for a deep and thought-provoking experience, anyway.  \n\nAnd who would have guessed that Anne Hathaway would be so good in an action role? I&apos;d love to see her do more of this kind of thing in the future, she has a bit of a talent for it.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw Sunset, recently, during a middle-of-the-night channel surf that ended up on a cable channel running the film at about 4:00am. I had never seen the film before, but had always been interested because of the two leads, and the era in which the film is set (the late 1920s).\n\nI enjoyed the film, quite a bit, actually. I thought the story was very good, and well written, and Garner and Willis made a great team. I especially enjoyed Willis&apos; characterization of Tom Mix. He brought just the right amount of cowboy style to the silen movie hero. And, of course, Garner is always good. But he really excelled as Wyatt Earp.\n\nI thought the premise was very original, and that the whole film was a lot of fun.\n\nWith one exception. \n\nWhy is the villain of this piece so obviously supposed to remind us of Charley Chaplin ? Alvy Alperin ? Formerly known as The Happy Hobo ? A clear reference to Chaplin, and his little tramp. And yet the character is an abuseive rapist, and murderer who beats his own wife to death.\n\nWhy Edwards chose to virtually villify one of the most talented and entertaining comedians of the silent era, who was also a fairly nice bloke in real life, if a bit of a womanizer, I do not know.\n\nThe other original characters in the film- that is character who are fictional, rather than historical, like Earp, and Mix, are very well-crafted, believable, and completely original. No single character seems to be a rip on any single individual in Hollywood at the time, except for Malcolm McDowall&apos;s Alperin.\n\nAs a fan of Chaplin, Normand, Arbuckle, and the great silent clowns I found this to be a strong defect in the overall film. I can definitely believe Tom Mix as a hero. But I simply cannot reconcile even a thinly renamed Chaplin with a bully and a rapist.\n\nI wonder why Edwards didn&apos;t go the extra mile to make the Alperin character more original.\n\nAside from this point, which is a big one, really, the film is a lot of fun for fans of the period, and the leads."

He was the god of Hungarian football, which in the 1950s was admired all over the world. Puskás was loved everywhere he played and lived: in Madrid, in Athens, even in Melbourne people would chant his name in stadiums and ask for his autograph. He was, and still is, THE national ambassador of Hungary. Everybody has heard of his name. Puskás is he first thing that occurs to a foreigner&apos;s mind when they hear the country&apos;s name. Puskás is Hungary. The documentary takes us through all the main episodes of Puskás&apos; life, including the hardships of losing the 1954 World Cup final, and having to emigrate abroad under the communist regime. The film is simple, yet moving. It is about a man who not only received, but gave love to everyone he knew. He never let fame and stardom go to his head. He was a true legend.",

Followed by 4 script-free episodes the first episode had inspired millions worldwide. At present(2009) while the remake version is being filmed I have to say that; no matter who will perform Paul Kersey for the second time, he won&apos;t be able to impress us as Bronson did.\n\nRather than Bronson&apos;s performance Death Wish has its significant themes and screenplay components which were used at almost every action/crime movie later on, thus became clichés of their genre. Spending a lot of the running time through the bad guys&apos; side is the most fundamental component. This development was so modern and original, after a while it changed the outlook of the Crime genre. \n\nDeath Wish is nearly as good as Eastwood&apos;s Dirty Harry, with just a different taste. Obviously, this should have been produced only once; since the sequels misrepresented its purpose.",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this film overall, especially in its portrayal of Brecht&apos;s efforts to keep harmony within the little harem he&apos;d created for himself. Nonetheless, I have some objections to the political overtones of the film. The film unfortunately reinforces the old anti-communist cliché of life in the DDR (&apos;East Germany&apos;) as a nightmarish existence under a police state, and we are introduced to that idea early on when the Stasi (the DDR&apos;s FBI) come knocking at the door to inquire about one of Brecht&apos;s guests, Wolfgang Harich. And it certainly comes as no surprise to anyone that the Brechts&apos; summer vacation ends with Harich&apos;s arrest(moreover, there&apos;s the suggestion that, in politics, Brecht&apos;s soon-to-end life came down to just that: turning a blind eye to the oppressive character of the DDR).\n\nThere&apos;s a bit of historical distortion here, however. Harich was active in the SED (the DDR&apos;s Communist Party) for a number of years and known to be in opposition to the existing leadership, as he attempted to articulate and rally support for a &apos;third path&apos; between capitalism and bureaucratic socialism, a so-called &apos;humane socialism.&apos; He was not arrested by the Stasi at the end of the summer of 1956, but rather in November of that year. What&apos;s the dif? Well, in the fall of 1956 there occurred the uprising in Hungary, which eventually took on virulently anti-Soviet overtones, with the consequence that it was interpreted by all the regimes in the &apos;socialist&apos; bloc as life-threatening. In other words, Harich&apos;s arrest was not so much evidence of the DDR&apos;s inability to tolerate dissenting ideas as it was a measure of the state of international, geo-political tensions at that time (don&apos;t forget, similar things had gone on in the US with the anti-communist witch hunts). In fact, Harich, after his release from prison in 1964, went on to publish and teach in the DDR: he continued to argue for German re-unification under socialist auspices and for greater attention to environmental concerns under socialism; he traveled to the West and always returned to the DDR (though opportunities to &apos;defect&apos; were not lacking), and, after the collapse of the DDR, refused to testify against those who had imprisoned him in 1956. He remained a life-long proponent of a socialist society and economy in which the human values of friendship and community, solidarity and equality, health and environment, culture and enlightenment would hold sway over the commercialization of all aspects of life that is our fate under capitalism. And he firmly believed that, however warped the socialism of the DDR had been in the past, it contained the seeds for evolving in the right direction.\n\nI also find objectionable the suggestion that Brecht himself was complicit in the DDR&apos;s oppressiveness, at least to the extent that he failed to publicly denounce Ulbrecht (the DDR&apos;s leader at the time) and his regime. I think it fair to say that someone who objected to many aspects of the DDR regime but still wished to hold on to his influence with the leaders would necessarily walk a dangerous tightrope; and it is no easy matter to judge whether Brecht would have served the cause of humane socialism better had he spoken out more forcefully against Ulbrecht&apos;s regime (though, obviously, that would make for better cinema).",

It&apos;s the same as Star Wars to an extent. It&apos;s part of a bigger story. Number two progresses the story And raises some new questions to dive into. I would like to recommend you watch Prophecy 1 before you watch number Prophecy two. Just so you can understand the story better."

The professor tries to convince him to give himself up, by telling him three stories about how criminals always get caught in the end. In the first story, set in Vienna, Stewart Granger (who was too old for his role here) is a suave and shady character investigating the death of a reporter who was tracing a drug ring around the world; in the second story, set in Rome and, unlike the other two, played mostly as a slapstick comedy, Pierre Brice is a secret agent trying to deliver some important documents to his boss while being chased by a gang led by a woman with a whip; in the third story, set in San Francisco and Rio, Lex Barker is a private detective trying to stop a political assassination plot by posing as the assassin himself. In the end, there is a major plot twist that tries to tie everything together, but the film ends up making even less sense than before! Some of the &quot;names&quot; in the cast (Klaus Kinski, Karin Dor of &quot;Topaz&quot;) have very limited screen time, and although the film does boast a variety of international locations, the three episodes generate little excitement or (if that was the purpose of the second story) laughter. For 60&apos;s spy-movie completists only. (*1/2)",

With unlikely heroes,gay, crippled, broken, addicted, colored and colorful I am totally under the spell of it. Abandon your prejudices and Strange Frame makes it easy as it weaves a cloth of seduction in your mind. It is a different way for the hero to get the girl. See it and come away humming the soundtrack. And by the way, that soundtrack is a cross between down home blues and sultry jazz clues. I cannot wait to own this film in my personal collection.",

      "reviewBody": "The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film, to be honest, I had ever really heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said that they would have a 2-week screening of the film, with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the vein of the classic French crime films ala Jean Pierre Melville, I jumped at the chance to check it out (at best it would rank up with his great works, and at worst I would get some good popcorn in a great theater). It was well worth the admission, as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re-discovered (or discovered for the first time). With terrific, tense diligence, Sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film, keeping a good (if not great) middle section, and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films, but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters. With a film in the vein of this sort, you know how it will end, but it&apos;s the cool, observant journey that counts.\n\nThe film features a performance with some real truth and honesty, amid the &quot;old-school&quot; criminal&apos;s code, by Lino Ventura as Aldo, who at the start of the film (one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country) steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime). When there is a sudden, ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night, Aldo is again on the run with two little kids. He gets the aid of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and drives him into Paris. But there are some problems with some of Aldo&apos;s old business partner&apos;s, and one old score may be just the right ticket. A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely, but it isn&apos;t. Like Melville, Sautet doesn&apos;t allow any fat to his story, and it&apos;s a very tightly structured film, with some good doses of humor here and there (I was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence, and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish).\n\nAlong with a fine score by the great George Delerue, exceptional cinematography, and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now adays, Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old-school film-noir, and the latter day crime films. Gangsters in these new sort of &quot;thug-life&quot; movies have a 1000th of the class and honor of the thieves in this film, and is a second banana to the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you). That it has a good realistic, moral edge helps as well.",

It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a somewhat similar film Je t&apos;aime Je t&apos;aime which was also about love and memories.Message of this film is loud and clear :true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation.L&apos;amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.It is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.This is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped.",

This movie has the &apos;feel&apos; of reality to it. I recognized so many of the people I worked with in this movie. Every radio station has some of them. The studios of the period were just like this.\n\nOf course, this movie was severely compressed in time and space. Radio is like warfare: lengthy periods of utter boredom punctuated by periods of pure panic. We don&apos;t need to see the slow bits. Each hour of on-air radio presentation requires something like three hours of preparation: we don&apos;t see the hard work that goes into such a show.\n\nWe do see a very funny and entertaining movie. Don&apos;t forget, I was in the industry at the time this all happened: and this one feels &apos;real&apos; to me.\n\nMany autobiographical pieces by &quot;stars&quot; turn into awful sycophantic schmaltz-fests. This one didn&apos;t. It could have been awful. Most of this kind are. This one... is excellent.\n\nAnd if you&apos;ve never worked in broadcasting -- it&apos;s still very funny!",

The setting is unusual, and the plot has some entertaining twists.\n\nWilliam Hurt plays Senior Investigator Renko, of the Moscow Militia (i.e. police). He is assigned to a high-profile murder case, and finds himself alternately prodded on, hindered or even threatened by his own superiors, by the KGB and by his obvious suspect. All these people are acting so self-confidently compared to Renko&apos;s plodding, that the sense of loneliness, or even of paranoia is very apparent.\n\nMuch of the action is contrived and unconvincing, both in its development and denouement, although the film does build to a good climax. On the other hand, all the characterisations of ordinary russians, who must have been strange creatures to film directors and audiences alike at the time, is very good.\n\nThe directors discarded one of the original novel&apos;s best tricks, that of sending Renko to New York (to recover valuable state property), and confronting him with the law enforcement system which gave rise to &quot;Kojak&quot; and the &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.\n\nOverall this is quite a good film, and fairly close to the novel. There are some sequels written which deserve to appear on the screen."

The film deals with the clash of values between Hershey, along with her boyfriend (Scott Glenn), and the couple. It also deals honestly and surprisingly fairly with the emotional turmoil all four characters go through. Supposedly the film was dismissed upon its released because of the way it depicted hippie culture, but it is much more positive than a good amount of the films of the day (see Joe, for instance). It neither accepts nor dismisses either of the two classes, but instead deals with the four principals as individuals. The four characters are sensitively written (director Bridges, most famous for writing and directing The China Syndrome, wrote the script here, as well). Hershey, Wilcox-Horne (AKA Wilcox Paxton), Groom, and Glenn all give exceptional performances.",

      "name": "An underrated Amicus horror anthology!",
      "reviewBody": "TORTURE GARDEN is the second in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, this would make eight movies. Although, that movie is very different from the others.\n\nI look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.\n\nTORTURE GARDEN is a very misleading title for this movie because there is no torture and no garden.\n\nThe movie has been unfairly maligned by IMDb users. I will put up an argument in its defence.\n\nThe linking story in this movie is easily one of the best found in Amicus anthologies. It provides a long but highly interesting introduction that had me hooked from the first moment. Burgess Meredith gives a truly magnificent performance as the sinister showman, Dr. Diabolo. He persuades a group of fairground visitors that he can show them real horror. Four of the visitors have their futures predicted and this constitutes the framework for the stories.\n\nThe first story sees Michael Bryant as a somewhat opportunistic young man who allows his uncle to die just so he can get his hands on his money. The uncle has a mysterious cat that leaves coins behind every time someone is killed. Bryant ends up going on a mini killing spree to get the money. In the end, he goes crazy and is locked up. He thinks he&apos;s free of the cat, but is he? Watch and see. This story provides a solid start to the movie. Michael Bryant gives a great performance as a greedy man who is driven to insanity.\n\nThe second story takes a very different course to the first. In this quirky tale, Beverly Adams plays an actress determined to find out why other actors manage to stay young. This story is very much maligned. I admit that one really has to suspend disbelief when viewing this story but I found it entertaining and Miss Adams looked very glamorous in her part.\n\nThe third story sees Barbara Ewing as a journalist falling in love with a pianist, played by John Standing. This strange piano with a mind of its own becomes jealous of their affair and decides to do something about it. This is easily the weakest story in the movie. It not only requires suspension of disbelief but is mostly boring to sit through. The end is unintentionally funny but not really entertaining enough to endure the rest of the story for. John Standing is very bland in his role and his performance is flat and lifeless. However, he can&apos;t really be blamed for that given the absurd story he has to work with. Barbara Ewing fares better, giving everything she&apos;s got, but even she can&apos;t save this story.\n\nThe final story and easily the best puts the movie back on track. Jack Palance is a fanatic of Edgar Allan Poe&apos;s work. He meets a fellow fanatic, played by the late great Peter Cushing. Cushing lets him into a secret - Poe has come back from the dead and is writing new stories. The finale of this story is very confusing but interesting to watch. Jack Palance does little more than stand around smoking a pipe in this and the linking story. Another IMDb user has stated on the comments page that Christopher Lee would have been a better choice for the role. I certainly agree with that analogy.\n\nFreddie Francis directs the material he is given very well, adding a particularly unique effect at the end of each story. When the transition is made from a story back to the linking story, a pair of scissors is seen and heard cutting a ribbon. This creates the effect of snapping both the character and the audience out of what is presented as a kind of nightmare. Some excellent camera angles in the first story help to make it seem more macabre than it really is. Some intelligent editing is employed in the third story to try covering up its absurdity.\n\nOverall, TORTURE GARDEN has its flaws but is a must-see for fans of the Amicus anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes, check it out. You&apos;ll enjoy it!",

      "reviewBody": "Gate II (1990) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nThis sequel tries to follow on from the original movie and now it features Terry (Louis Tripp) trying to close the doors that were originally opened. Things don&apos;t go as planned as soon he and three friends unleash the minions and two of them decide to try and get some wishes granted.\n\nI must admit that I really wasn&apos;t expecting too much out of this sequel and especially since I wasn&apos;t overly thrilled with the original movie. There&apos;s no question that this film had a much smaller budget to work with and this is obvious during the special effects scenes. With that said, I really thought the movie was entertaining for what it was. Was it a masterpiece or an Oscar-winner? Of course not but it wasn&apos;t trying to be. I&apos;m guessing fans of the original aren&apos;t fans of this one but for the most part I found it to be entertaining.\n\nFor me the best thing about the movie were the four lead characters and performances. I thought Tripp, Simon Reynolds, James Villemaire and Pamela Segall were all very good in their roles and I thought their performances helped make the film all the more entertaining. There&apos;s not always monsters or action on the screen so we needed the characters to keep us entertained and for the most part they did. I liked hanging out with them and felt they added to the entertainment value.\n\nThe special effects aren&apos;t as good as the first film but they are practical ones and for the most part they look good enough for this type of &quot;B&quot; movie. If you&apos;re expecting a lot of gore then you&apos;ll be disappointed because there isn&apos;t much, although there is a great sequence where one character begins to melt in a bathroom. With all of that being said, there&apos;s no question that the material wasn&apos;t the greatest and there certainly wasn&apos;t anything overly original here.\n\nGATE 2 isn&apos;t a great movie or even a good one but it&apos;s pleasant enough and worth watching."

It&apos;s mostly about finding and following one&apos;s love, and it beautifully comes to a full circle, where all the 5 main protagonists are connected to each other. There are every possible emotions that a human being can get identified with, it deals with compassion, anger, love, lust and jealousy.\n\nWatch this movie, if you like some serious stuff. Performances are good, especially Juhi as Ira and Sanjay as Nikhil stand out. My rating 9 is for unusual story line, some great acting and, to the director for making an effort to be different.",

Much like Sheen&apos;s other 1994 movie, &apos;Terminal Velocity&apos;, &apos;The Chase&apos; is a entertaining action film looking for a brain, which it can&apos;t seem to find. It&apos;s good, lighthearted fluff with likeable leads, some good scenes, and an excellent film-long chase (thus the title).\n\n\tIt&apos;s careful not to get too complex, and will likely appeal to those of us who enjoyed &apos;Speed&apos;. On problem I had was the premature ending. It happened way too early and left several crucial plot points unfinished. Also the script comes and goes, one scene it&apos;s there, the next it&apos;s gone. That gets tremendously annoying, and the lack of good dialog at times hampers the impact.\n\n\tStill, &apos;The Chase&apos; is an entertaining piece of cinema if you have an afternoon to pass with nothing to do, even if it is rather predictable.\n\n7/10"

He believes in the American Dream and wants the follow the example of his friend Vijay (Emil Marwa), who moved to USA and in accordance with his letters, has a Mercedez Benz and lives in a wonderful penthouse. When Ramu arrives in New York, he realizes that Vijay indeed is a complete loser, working as a cab driver and waiter in an Indian restaurant, and sharing a simple apartment with two other friends, one of them illegal. While looking for a job as an actor, the naive Ramu ends in a porn movie, and he meets the porn star Sharonna (Heather Graham), who teaches him some secrets to have a good performance in front of the camera and the shooting crew. Later, in the birthday party of Lexi (Marisa Tomei) in the wealthy house of her parents, he pretends to be a guru, and becomes very successful as the Guru of Sex, using the advice of Sharonna. This silly and delightful story is a great homage to Bollywood and a very good entertainment. Like in the Indian movies of Bollywood, there are lots of songs and numbers of dances, and the cast is very nice and enjoyable. Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei are beautiful as usual, and there are many funny scenes. It is impossible not liking such a sweet romantic comedy. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Guru do Sexo&quot; (&quot;The Guru of the Sex&quot;)",

Although it contains its share of exploitation elements, large sections of this film are really tongue-in-cheek and pretty damned funny actually. Sid Haig and Pam Grier are great as revolutionaires, and there are a sprinkling of decent character actors that round out the cast for a decent outing.  The ending is chock full of early 70&apos;s combat sequences and wonderfully photographed burning buildings.  Actually, I was also impressed by the director&apos;s good use of scenery; I hate to admit it, but the backdrop (jungle and mountains) were actually breathtaking in parts.",

      "name": "Fierce, stupendous writing, acting, and craft - marred by something much more dubious",
      "reviewBody": "Credit where it&apos;s due: filmmaker Christoph Ruggia and cowriter Olivier Lorelle penned an astonishingly fierce screenplay. Where it occasionally diverts even slightly from its core strength one can readily discern it&apos;s troubled by comparison; as a prime example, consider the major moment and curious plot point coming shortly after the one-hour mark. However, in its heavy focus on Joseph, Chloé, and the relationship between them, the writing is sharp and exquisite, often altogether downright brutal, and absolutely spellbinding. Chloé, autistic and all but entirely nonverbal, struggles to interact and grapple with the world, and be understood, in those ways she knows how. Joseph is as angry as the sun is hot, not to mention emotionally disturbed, and he readily lashes out at a moment&apos;s notice, while also being immensely protective of Chloé. Put the two of them together and the question quickly becomes who needs who more, and who truly understands who better. These dynamics resonate so deeply that they organically foster significant, heavy emotions regardless of what&apos;s happening in a specific scene - but to that point, the scene writing is so strong as Joseph and Chloé stumble about, with increasingly desperate situations in which for that ferocious push and pull to make waves, that the narrative which manifests is inescapably absorbing as the children move forward to an unknown, uncertain future.\n\nThat&apos;s one thing &apos;Les diables&apos; unquestionably has going for it. Another is the cast. Everyone on hand gives tight, striking performances, and where usually I&apos;d criticize acting that&apos;s as brusque and forceful as it is here - definitely echoing the tenor of Ruggia&apos;s direction - in this case I think that aggressive drift is very appropriate for this tale, and these characters. My commendations to all, though by all means Vincent Rottiers is rather captivating all by himself as anguished Joseph. He embodies the furious, bitter agitation of the boy all too well, to the point that it&apos;s somewhat difficult to separate part from player, but also illustrates gratifying nuance and range in betraying the underlying hurt and vulnerability. Personally, I&apos;m surprised Rottiers wasn&apos;t more celebrated for his portrayal, because I think he&apos;s terrific. In fairness, in subsequent years he was quickly outshone by costar Adèle Haenel, who at this point needs no introduction. Even in only her debut role, thirteen years old at the time this was released, Haenel demonstrates a wholehearted commitment in her performance, and an unwavering passion and vitality as an actor, that exemplifies why she would go on to earn such stellar acclaim. If anything I think she&apos;s limited here by the nature of how Chloé is written, and perhaps in turn by Ruggia&apos;s direction, yet for the fact that even here she impresses so greatly is a fabulous testament to her skills.\n\nWe have to talk about the elephant in the room, though, and to do so, it&apos;s worth drawing comparisons to another French filmmaker. Louis Malle was a man who quite courted controversy in his career, for he had no qualms about broaching taboo topics - and he committed fully to realizing those topics on film, whatever that meant. Malle was never less than totally sincere, however, so while matters like underage nudity or incest can and should make us flinch in real life, his pictures come across as meaningful storytelling and exploration of these topics instead of the tawdry, dubious exploitation it could so easily be. As &apos;Les diables&apos; delves into similar murky territory I believe in all earnestness that by and large the inclusions here, uncomfortable at best and almost entirely unwatchable at worst, do come from a place of simply relating a story, ugly though it might get, and not ducking away from the most unseemly aspects of it. On the other hand, the way the camera lingers on Haenel during her nude scenes, and the length and number of them, is distinctly disconcerting. To whatever extent the feature is only being true to the saga on hand, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much arguing that it does also cross a line to be more than a little unscrupulous and indiscrete. Unfortunately, that foul notion is bolstered by the revelations in recent years about Ruggia&apos;s appalling behavior toward Haenel throughout the production. There&apos;s no excuse for what multiple people have accordingly corroborated, and that paints in a new, seedier light the degree to which Ruggia, as director, chose to showcase a thirteen-year old child as he did.\n\nThough it&apos;s off-putting at first I do overall admire the direction here from a fundamental standpoint of orchestrating shots and scenes, and guiding the cast. And in all other ways this is splendidly well done, including those stunts and effects that are employed, production design, cinematography, editing, and so on. It bears repeating, too, that Rottiers&apos; debut as Joseph, and Haenel&apos;s as Chloé, are outstanding, matching the stark, powerful writing note for note. In every way that counts, this movie is superb - I dare say, even better than I had hoped - a fine credit to (most) all involved, and easily deserving of a solid, high recommendation. This makes it all the more regrettable that Ruggia&apos;s poor behavior, and his dubious decisions regarding a select few shots and scenes, append a sketchy, wary asterisk to the title, and very much dampen the enthusiasm of any recommendation. For all the hard work and intelligence that went into &apos;Les diables,&apos; and those ways in which it succeeds so roundly, it is well worth seeking out whether one is an especial fan of Rottiers, Haenel, or anyone else who participated. For those ways in which Ruggia&apos;s stamp was indelibly placed upon the production as a person and as a director, any discussion one would have of this gets a lot more complicated. Watch, if you have the chance, but watch with keen awareness.",

Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals. The awkwardness of the actors is framed by strange pauses, jarring scripts and incredibly bizarre production techniques - there are ample &apos;deer in the headlights&apos; moments, in which you can feel genuine sympathy for these people who are obviously so caught up in Tommy&apos;s strange and dominating creative control that they&apos;ve failed to see any better.\n\nOther filmmakers play with similarly surreal concepts - David Lynch for example - but this film lacks anything resembling artistic refinement, insight or self awareness placing it far from comparison. It&apos;s kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion - random, incoherent, disastrous, accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what&apos;s happening on screen, which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.\n\nThe camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas, nor would the script and plot, but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau&apos;s artistic integrity. This really is a new frontier.\n\nIt is truly awful, but I cannot recommend it enough.",

The fact that I vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact. \n\nIt is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier. But they were nonetheless very powerful.\n\nThis subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years. And it was most effectively treated here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism.\n\nI wish it would be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??",

It also has very creative and quotable dialogue inluding the term boatdrinks.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the crime genre or anyone who is a fan of the cast. Watch this film, quote the dialogue and be a gangster yourself."

He plays a Secret Service agent who is having a frustrating time protecting the fiesty former first lady, Shirley McClain.  Lots of funny dialogue, the chemistry between the two is great.  \n\nNot quite as over the top as &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; or &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (although he was hilarious in both of those as well)...He&apos;s got the facial expressions and timing of a great comic actor.\n\nThere are also some good supporting performances.  You&apos;ll laugh a lot watching this movie.  One that might slip under the radar screen but is definitely worth checking out.",

It is time to change that.\n\nJack Neo has done a good job in putting subtle yet clear messages in every corner.  I&apos;m pleased to hear that he survived the censors and hope he did not antagonize the government.  I heard that this movie also has gotten the attention of the media and our government.\n\nThe issues brought up in this movie are all real and reasons why I chose to leave Singapore.  This movie made me homesick instantly.\n\nI want to congratulate Jack Neo and his team for their courage to pursue this film.  You have the courage that I didn&apos;t have.  Press on.\n\nIf you&apos;re a Singaporean and you&apos;ve not watched it yet, please do.\n\nIf you&apos;re a parent, please re-think about what &quot;best for your kid&quot;.\n\nIf you&apos;re an executive, ang-moh&apos;s are not superior.\n\nIf a guy litters, you&apos;re not being kay poh to ask him to pick it up.\n\nLiving in America, it is not my ability in the English language that make me proud.  It is my ability in the Chinese language, culture &amp; history that sets me apart from the rest.  Don&apos;t forget your roots.\n\nI wish all of us, Singaporeans, luck.\n\nSincerely, Hokkien Peng"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Aria&quot; as a whole is a pretty underwhelming experience, as most compilation films are. No one segment is very long, so the whole thing is painless to sit through, but I can&apos;t really bring myself to recommend it to anyone.\n\nThe standout segment for me was Ken Russell&apos;s, which depicts a woman hallucinating while on the operating table after a terrible car accident. It helps that the segment is set to &quot;Nessum dorma,&quot; one of my favorite opera pieces -- I would find a filmed toaster glorious as long as it was set to that particular piece of music. Franc Roddam&apos;s segment is pretty decent, and features Bridget Fonda in her film debut. I liked Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s segment, which is set in a gym and features a bunch of body builders completely oblivious of the naked women dancing around them -- perhaps a comment on male narcissism? Robert Altman&apos;s segment, which is primarily the reason I wanted to see this movie at all, is utterly forgettable -- the only notable thing about it is that you can tell he was filming &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; at the same time, as many of the same actors are in both. Nicholas Roeg&apos;s segment, which opens the film, is pretty bad, as is Julien Temple&apos;s painfully unfunny contribution (though it features a smokin&apos; Beverly D&apos;Angelo), while Bruce Beresford&apos;s is just boring. Watch Derek Jarman&apos;s segment for a glimpse of a very young and pretty Tilda Swinton.\n\nThere&apos;s not much to say about films like this. Some portions are better than others; none of them are masterpieces.\n\nGrade: B-",

      "name": "A maverick magnum opus with a political theme -- rare in American movies",
      "reviewBody": "Warren Beatty&apos;s magnum opus Reds was presented as a revival film official selection of the New York Film Festival 2006 to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its original appearance.\n\nReds&apos;s greatest virtue may be that it&apos;s grand, without being pompous, film-making. It&apos;s a film that takes some pride in being big and turbulent and unruly. It&apos;s important, but it&apos;s not tidy. It&apos;s in part certainly very much about ideology, but it avoids sharp, well-honed edges or large hard-etched &quot;points.&quot; John Reed (played by the film&apos;s impresario, its sole producer, director, co-author, and star, Warren Beatty) was a man who happened to be able to write a first-hand account of the Bolshevik revolution, a long-time bestseller called Ten Days That Shook the World. At that time early in the twentieth century in America Reed arguably was a central figure, if only in the sense that during his time in Greenwich Village he managed to be (as he wanted to be) consistently at the center of things American political and cultural  when he wasn&apos;t in Russia (which was pretty central then too). Roger Ebert thinks the movie &quot;never succeeds in convincing us that the feuds between the American socialist parties were much more than personality conflict and ego-bruisings&quot; (that may depend on how hard we need to be convinced to begin with), but we do care about Reds (Ebert thinks) as &quot;a traditional Hollywood romantic epic, a love story written on the canvas of history, as they used to say in the adsit is the thinking man&apos;s Doctor Zhivago, told from the other side, of course.&quot; What about the choice of Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton as the lovers? Initially that may seem an odd and chemistry-poor decision. (I&apos;m not sure I overcome that impression.) But arguably the film takes long enough with each of its main characters to make them into rounded people, complex enough to be attractive to others and to each other. Beatty uses the romance to hold the story together, and in doing so, he follows a conventional enough scheme. Reds stands out from other American mainstream products  and for all its maverick central force, it remains that  in its attempt to deal seriously with complex socio-political events during a turbulent period, and to approach them in an open-minded way. Beatty weaves other significant characters into the fabric of his drama, notably the leftist activist Emma Goldman (Maureen Stapleton, who got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) and the radical editor Max Eastman (Edward Herrmann), who are members of the same political-intellectual salon into which he brings Louise, as is the playwright Eugene O&apos;Neill (Jack Nicholson).\n\nBeatty&apos;s filmic recreation of John Reed is good in not being too serious or too idealized: in having a silly side Beatty&apos;s Reed perhaps has something of himself. Reed&apos;s lover Louise Bryant (Keaton), though originally a bourgeois lady from Portland, is similarly rounded; she&apos;s led by her relationship to Reed to develop other facets and strengths, and further enlarged as a personality through the way the film depicts her long affair with the alcoholic O&apos;Neill, played by a toned-down but emotionally potent Nicholson. His discontent and negative energy are disturbing. Personalities anchor the film; but in some of the political debates and adventures one loses track and forgets why Reed is somewhere in Russia. He is at the center of things. But why he is where he is otherwise at certain moments is uncertain. In its ambition to keep juggling the many balls of major personalities and major political currents and historical events, Reds loses some of its narrative clarity and momentum over time. Complex political and historical currents are tracked, but the emotional trajectory loses its momentum. Nonetheless the film develops sweep in its length of three and a quarter hours. One walks out convinced that the material was complex enough to be worthy of such length, even if Beatty and his co-writer Trevor Griffiths could not whip it all into shape.\n\nWhether it&apos;s all worth it on the stage of international cinema or not, this is a film of historical interest as a great independent project, begun logically in the Seventies, but completed right in the middle of Hollywood by an American intelligent and engaged enough to be star, director, writer, and producer, to raise $35 million to do it, and to make more or less the movie he wanted to make  right in the middle, so to speak, of a wave of conservatism and yuppiedom, in the early Eighties, when people were thinking about making money and making it, when Ronald Reagon was President of the United States. What more appropriate time to reexamine this achievement than in the middle of the second term of George Bush II? No doubt Beatty took on this story because he was interested in a time in America when it was rife with left-wing politics. But he is realistic, and he made a Hollywood movie, with big stars and romance. And that&apos;s what it is and remains. But one can&apos;t imagine anybody else making it, and that&apos;s what makes it worth revisiting. Warren Beatty is an admirable maverick in the clone-heavy world of Southern California media-moguldom. He&apos;s a real person. And this is his great performance as a person and as an artist. I first saw it with a group of real communists. &quot;We&apos;re &quot;reds,&quot; they said as we walked out. The theater staff looked impressed. I was bowled over by their pride. Not everyone watches this film as a &quot;traditional Hollywood romantic epic.&quot; It would never have been made if that were all it was. Its grandeur and ambition are still moving and it must not be forgotten. For a more pungent treatment of a political and social theme starring Beatty, consider Hal Ashby&apos;s 1975 Shampoo.",

      "reviewBody": "After watching perhaps the most reckless, surreal, mystical-style take on the ultra-bloody grind-house samurai epic, I&apos;m not too sure who is more relentless, its main character- the unstoppable un-dead/spirit Izo (Kazuya Nakayama, likely in the performance of a career, for better &amp;/or worse) or its director Takashi Miike. It&apos;s been compared to both Greek mythology and Jodorowsky&apos;s El Topo, and I can definitely see credence in both examples. In the first half hour to forty five minutes, actually longer if you account for, um, story, you&apos;re not sure precisely what the hell (no pun intended) is going on. Izo, at the start, gets crucified, and then we learn after a while (err, it&apos;s pretty obvious) he was quite the warrior and swordsman, who is out for vengeance as he comes back as an un-crushable spirit. Later on, we get a view into what tags along with him, in a female form, as a &apos;fragment&apos;, but for the most part one can only try to assume that Izo is on a collision course to nowhere, a pure embodiment of nihilistic anarchy who could be the Terminator in blood-eyed samurai garb if he/it actually had the mission.\n\nI can&apos;t deny that Miike deserves an &apos;A&apos; for effort on this sort of thing, but it&apos;s also the kind of project that veers the closest of all the work I&apos;ve seen of his so far to that most overused of terms- pretentious (albeit I haven&apos;t dug deep enough into his oeuvre to make that definitive). I mean, really, what are we to make of cut-aways at varied, completely random times of newsreel footage of dictators and famous world wars and atom bombs going off in black and white, sometimes in reverse mode, or in sped-up mode? What about a guy who comes in and out of the (very loosely laid) story to do acoustic-guitar musical numbers? It does all connect, I suppose, to the sort of random madness and almost Superman-like ability to not get really that harmed, unless around his quasi-kryptonite of the order of the &apos;Soul-fragment&apos;. A lot of what ends up popping up as sort of the history of Izo, before he was turned into the ultimate grudge with a sword, would be really interesting on its own, but strung together like this with the rest of the picture made it frustrating for me. Perhaps I wasn&apos;t ready enough for all of this, but for all of the virtuosity that Miike is going for with his bloody, full-blown surreal odyssey, only some of it works well while the rest falls into &apos;huh&apos; mode.\n\nBut the rest of this picture is what&apos;s almost teasingly ironic about Izo. As a swordplay movie, the kind that delivers the goods on action set-pieces and violence galore, doesn&apos;t disappoint, and if anything it shows Miike knows this kind of picture, which is why in a sense he&apos;s probably trying to lampoon it underneath the very dark and Gothic exterior. Nakayama is a real force to be reckoned with, and he works well in his all-too-limited role. It&apos;s always hard to do variations on the same style of killing- slicing a sword in the blink of an eye, and sometimes seeing the (appropriately) blood-soaked and flesh-torn aftermath, or in an immediate cut-away- and Miike pulls out his entire arsenal of tricks, including a set piece with the one American actor- Bob Sapp- who barely puts up a front either despite his huge size. But even with the creativity in many of Izo&apos;s murder sequences jarring and excitingly outrageous, the repetition becomes a little tiresome. And it wasn&apos;t that the picture was too confusing, though it does contain that side of the El Topo, where it&apos;s basically intentional for it to go in circle&apos;s around people&apos;s heads.\n\nThe messages that barrage the viewer though through the content (like in one scene where Izo is at a school and you-guess-what happens and there are cutaways to classrooms where kids are asked to define &apos;love&apos;, &apos;nation&apos;, and other ultra big words taken for granted) are what become fuzzy or just too off-kilter for their own good. For someone who is usually so sharp on the edge with satire, Miike here is trying to scrape up enough with the action to justify it being there, because, of course, Izo&apos;s world is in some otherworldly plain of Greek tragedy, Buddhism, and other factions that are also connected to the true depravities and horrors of the world. But it&apos;s too much on one plate, and there&apos;s definitely the sense of overload. It&apos;s the kind of picture where the director does, more often than not, stumble on his face with his own ambitions; that being said, I&apos;d much rather see a movie by Miike that only reaches up so high to its ideals than for a lesser filmmaker to just churn out typical product. Izo is anything but typical product, and it follows no rules (and destroys much like its character), which becomes part of the problem, at least on a first viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this last month at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival where the film&apos;s director Felix van Groeningen attended my screening to take an audience Q&amp;A following the film. Adapted from the Dimitri Verhulst novel by van Groeningen and Christopher Dirickx this is the story of young Gunter Strobe (Kenneth Vanbaeden) being brought up by his single and alcoholic father Marcel (Koen de Graeve) after his mother walked out on them. They live at grandma Strobe&apos;s (Gilda de Bal) house along with Gunter&apos;s hard partying uncles Petrol (Wouter Hendrickx), Beefcake (Johan Heldenbergh) and Koen (Bert Haelvort). the white trash family is so out of control that it&apos;s amazing that social services haven&apos;t taken Gunter out of this environment a long time ago, although they have threatened to. It&apos;s grandma Strobe with the only sensibility and sense of stability and guidance that keeps Gunter in the home but she has reached the point of exasperation in her the behavior of her sons. Valentijn Dhaenens plays the older Gunter looking back at his his childhood years and giving gratitude to his grandmother. this is an excellent cast. I only wish the grandmother&apos;s character was more developed and their was more of an on screen presence of her and also a little more of Gunter&apos;s mother and her marriage years to Marcel. The character of uncle Koen is underdeveloped as well. Many might find this film about a distasteful family distasteful as well but there is a lot to like in this relatively slow film and lots of dark comedy and genuine tragedy. This was Belgium&apos;s official submission to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best foreign Language film. It&apos;s van Groeningen&apos;s third film and the third time is a charm and I like this film. I&apos;ll look forward to more from the young director and more with a bigger budget hopefully. I loved the Roy Orbison scene. I would recommend this and give it an 8.5 out of 10.",

The first two they have little problem with, but these hugely enthusiastic people have to find C$15,000 over a weekend or they have arranged the travel of their play&apos;s director Guthrie as well as Irene Worth, Michael Bates and Alec Guinness for nought. Two mysterious donors solve that problem at the last minute and next we watch rehearsals for Richard III ahead of a sell out performance in this town of 30,000 people on July 13th 1953. The actual documentary itself delivers this story well here, with some good fly-on-the-wall observations of their logistical problems and of the actors preparing to stage this innovative version of a combative and lively play under canvas. The photographer manages to get himself into some wonderful vantage points as the play gets going, showing us just how seriously and professionally this cast took their task. Well worth a look.",

The acting really is convincing and the storyline is okay but there was just something missing for me. I was never frightened or had a creepy feeling. The killings really are okay, the blood flows and sometimes are even gory but still I expected a bit more of it. It surely is an ode to old school slashers but I guess the killer itself failed a bit. Made me think of Donnie Darko, you will know what i mean once you&apos;ve watched it. But the filming and editing was okay. When you see the so-called shots of the story of the book, the colors are into those of the seventies. A lot of flare is used, something we don&apos;t see these days. Again, there is enough for everyone. Blood, a bit of suspense, humor and of course nudity. Good effort, but as said, it&apos;s the killer who let me down. And if you don&apos;t like killing by hammers, don&apos;t watch it, it&apos;s hammer time!",

      "reviewBody": "The girl Gaëlle Faroult is kidnapped at school when she is about eight by Vincent Maillard (Reda Kateb) that imprisons her at the basement of his isolated house but provides everything she needs. Along the years, Gaëlle (Agathe Bonitzer) unsuccessfully tries to escape. But when she is seventeen, Vincent surprisingly let her go. Now Gaëlle has problems to adapt to her family and the outside world. \n\n&quot;À moi seule&quot; is one of those films with a promising storyline with great potential, telling the story of a girl that is kidnapped at school when she is about eight and the difficulties of adaptation to her family when she is finally released by the kidnapper when she is a seventeen year-old teenager. The storyline of the recent and awarded &quot;Room&quot; (2015) has many elements from &quot;À moi seule&quot;, but with an excellent screenplay. Unfortunately the promising storyline is wasted in poor and messy screenplay, edition and characters development. The first question about &quot;À moi seule&quot; is why the lonely Vincent kidnapped Gaëlle? His motives are never clear. Did he intend to raise a child expecting the connection of &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; when she reaches adulthood? If yes, it does not make any sense the whole story. The second point is who is Vincent and Gaëlle&apos;s parents? The screenplay shows points of their relationship in a shallow way only. Last but not the least, a non-linear screenplay shall be very well-written to let the viewer understand events from the past that are affecting the character in the present. However the flashbacks are confused and the viewer does not immediately understand that it is a flashback scene. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;De Volta Para Casa&quot; (&quot;Back Home&quot;)",

He doesn&apos;t care to develop a clear story, he has a way of surprising us continually through the exploitation of the characters which cover all the range of emotions. He can take any human and expose them to supernatural occurrences until they goes mad; they live in a constant nightmare. His actors occasionally go in a real trance and purge themselves of all emotions, crying and laughing simultaneously. It seems as if he is dissecting humans and beneath all that flesh and terror there lies a spirit, alone and in darkness.\n\nNear the end someone cites the Apocalypse, and goes something like this: and then they will search for death and they won&apos;t find it. And that seems as the center point to the movies I&apos;ve seen. In a way you can say he believes in an eternal return of the soul, but what he longs for is tranquility in death and so life to him is just a terrible passing, and so it is occasionally for many.\n\nAbout the movie, well, it can be mistaken for some supernatural horror flick, some will be repelled by the style others will embrace it. But to me his movies are more of the overall experience and the way they linger in our subconscious as an infernal palace which we try to discredit and judge unreal, but which we inhabit.",

My father saw the last time this movie about  30 years this film ago, and it is very interesting to see how well he remembers some of the conversations.\n\nIt is even based on a true story of the second world war.  In `the silent raid&apos; the activities of the KP (knokploegen), roughly translated ` strong-arm squads&apos;, are the main theme.  The movie begins when inspector Bakker is caught by the occupiers. The KP tries to get him back by attacking the car in which the Germans bring him to prison. The attack fails and as a result the Germans take revenge by shooting 6 persons in the prison `house of confinement&apos;. Inspector Bakker is being questioned by Grundmann but he does not say anything. The Germans torture him for that. Some time later Bakker tells to Doctor Wartena that he knows 30 names and addresses of people who work in the resistance, and where the KP&apos;s hides the weapons. With much help from Eppie, Wim and Mies the leader, Piet Kramer tries to work out a plan, of helping Bakker out of prison. Eppie knows very much of Leeuwarden and its people tries to get some support from Jellema, a friendly man, who blames himself for working in the prison, but who is in fact in the right place at the right time. In the meantime, inspector Bakker tries to protect his friends with the help of doctor of the prison, a person who until that moment was not involved with the fight against the germans. Eventually the KP works out a plan in which they try not to shoot with their guns, because in a building straight ahead the prison day and night german soldiers are located, and they will hear even 1 shot from there. Kramer and his men succeed in to take about 50 people from the prison. A tabloid in the high wall of the prison commemorates this event.\n\nAn interesting consequence of the film is that we can get a nice picture of the city of Leeuwarden, a city of about 75000 people, and also the main city of the . I don&apos;t live far from Leeuwarden and I&apos;m also very interested in geography, and I therefore took the opportunity to visit the vicinity of the prison. Indeed the prison is straight ahead a building with a distance of only about 30 metres (across water), and where 24 hours a day armed Germans were located.\n\nWhat I also liked was the diversity of the characters. I liked for instance Piet for his energy and wisdom, inspector Bakker for his somber intelligence, Wim for his impetuousness. Many characters are not difficult to relate to, they have fears, are hard-working and have integrity. The actors did a wonderful job I can&apos;t even think of one actor who does not act well, but I am no judge of that.\n\nStrong aspects of this movie are: solidarity, thrust, friendship. And there is even a sarcastic sense of humour. Indeed, I know very little movies where the emphasis laid on solidarity is so strong, and that&apos;s great, because solidarity is not as good nowadays as it had been before. Matter-of-factness is also a strong aspect, that&apos;s also a strong characteristic of the Netherlands, maybe the north of it especially.\n\nThere are much nice scenes in this movie. Some of my favourite are when Piet talks to his men in the bakery, when Bakker is in the office of Grundmann, and when Wim and Piet stand in front of the prison door, and when Jelle is putting his gun on the head of Koopman and seems to enjoy this. Koopman is a Dutch man supporting the Germans.\n\nI had several questions after seeing this film, but it does not matter anymore, because when I took some books from the library, I learned much out of them and had a nice time. Many events actually took place during the movie, and the characterization of the persons were very much like real life. This was partly possible because many members of the KP were still alive during the making of the movie, and have helped the producers. The greatest thing I learned was that the germans did not punish Friesland in any way for the silent raid. The germans  admired Piet and his group of 24 men, and were pleased by their correct conduct.\n\nI hope everyone will get the chance of seeing this movie."

Here we have in the lead two bimbos playing two bimbos, but the male cast is not any better: Schlager-singer Michael Schanze is a poor man&apos;s Roy Black (and thàt is very poor) and sly dog Ernst Schultz lets the colours of the film dwindle with his tooth-paste-smile-dentures.\n\nLater in the 70&apos;s director Franz Antel, a man with no artistic aspirations what-so-ever, would make a number of so-called soft-sex comedies; in this film there are a couple of shots of girls (when Günther Phillip has his guest appearance) which can be seen as a first try in the genre.",

I think making the movie must have been hilarious. Granted Indiana Jones has some classic lines and Harrison Ford pulls it off most excellently, there are still some great jokes in the movie. Give the producers a break. They probably had to start out somewhere as well. Take the movie for the comedy and silly acting for what it is: entertainment, because, after all the is what it is all about."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Theirs is the Glory&quot; is a unique film, indeed. It doesn&apos;t have a single professional actor, but its cast is made up solely of men of the British 1st Airborne Division who fought in the Battle of Arnhem. It is the only film ever made of a major war battle on the site and within a short time after it took place. The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, the largest airborne assault in history. Market Garden involved more than 35,000 troops of the British 1st Airborne Division, the Polish Airborne Brigade attached to the Brits, and the American 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions. Market Garden took place from Sept. 17 to 25, 1944. \n\nOne year after the battle – just four months after the end of the war in Europe, survivors of the 1st Airborne Division collected at Arnhem to stage a reenactment of the bloody battle. Every single man who appears in the film had been part of the operation. Many of the Bits donned German uniforms for the film. Along with reenactment scenes, the movie incorporates actual combat footage shot during the battle by the British Army. This film was a joint effort by the British Army film and photographic unit and the J. Arthur Rank Organization. Noted Irish filmmaker Brian Desmond Hurst directed the film. He was a World War I veteran and protégé of Hollywood director John Ford. The film premiered a year later – two years after the battle, on Sept. 17, 1946. It was a tremendous box office success, in spite of its rough production qualities.\n\nThis film shows battle scenes as they actually occurred to the best recollection of the men who took part in the battle. Those who were killed and many wounded of course, were not in the reenactment scenes. As an original work, that captured a real event with the actual participants, this film is a valuable historical record. I highly recommend it for movie fans, and those interested in war films and history. And, for further understanding of the battle, one should watch this film along with the 1977 movie, &quot;A Bridge Too Far.&quot; \n\nI appreciate the fact that no film could ever capture the reality or horror of bloody combat one may experience. Yet, I was surprised at the negative comments by some reviewers regarding the later film. I thought it paid great homage to the 1st Airborne Division and its men in the heavy fighting scenes and valiant stand they made. Of course, the 1977 film covered the whole operation as conceived by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. So, it necessarily showed much more of the background, and the many problems with the planning and carrying out the operation. \n\nThis film&apos;s focus is on the close combat of the British paratroopers. Most of the problems with the operation probably were not known to the troopers then. The 1977 film is able to give us the larger picture of the entire operation and the answers as to why there were problems and why the ultimate goal failed. Or, as Monty is said to have said in the 1977 film, why it was just &quot;90 percent successful.&quot; Perhaps some of the veterans were disgusted with the 1977 film for what it showed about the poor planning and preparation that left the British airborne forces dangling without relief.\n\nIn this film, we never see a questioning of plans, and never hear a concern about lack of communications or failure of the units to meet. Nor anything about the failure of the 2nd British Army to join up at all. It was supposed to be there within two days. Rather, we see the persevering and persistent British officers and men going forward as best they can. It&apos;s a good picture of a wonderfully dedicated bunch of men for that time. So, after or before watching this film, one should watch &quot;A Bridge too Far&quot; for the background and understanding of why things went awry. And movie buffs should know that that 1977 film gives much more time to the British forces, especially the 1st Airborne Brigade, and the operation planning and leadership, than it gives to the American 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions combined. &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; was based on a book by Irish author Cornelius Ryan. It was directed by Richard Attenborough, the multi-award winning and eminent English actor, director and producer. And it had a host of prominent movie stars – mostly leading British actors of the 20th century. \n\n&quot;Theirs is the Glory&quot; should be a part of any serious war film collection. And, alongside it should be &quot;A Bridge Too Far.&quot;\n\nWar history buffs may be interested to know a couple of details about Oosterbeek, Holland, which was where part of the Battle of Arnhem took place. British airborne commander, Major General Roy Urquhart made his headquarters in the Hotel Hartenstein. Today it houses the Airborne Museum, dedicated to the Battle of Arnhem. Every year on the first Saturday in September, Oosterbeek holds the annual Airborne March (Airborne Wandeltocht). It is a commemorative walk that passes by the hotel and the Airborne Cemetery were 1,750 British and Polish paratroopers are buried. It goes by the landing and drop zones, the battle woods, and the Old Church where the troops gathered during their retreat. People can do varying lengths of this walk, from five kilometers to 40. Nearly 35,000 people took part in the 2014 Airborne March.",

      "reviewBody": "What can I say about this movie?  PLENTY!  I discovered it right where it belongs, on TV at 3 in the morning, and it snapped me to full consciousness. The aliens are unbelievable, the plot is okay, the acting is priceless and the ending even goes for poignancy. The plot?  Oh yes there is one.  A bunch of strange monsters show up out of nowhere and terrorize a mountain village.  A stranger named Zachary discovers they came from a spaceship the crashed in the hills and nominates himself as a one man committee to round up and/or destroy the alien beasts. \n\n   Now you have to see these monsters to believe them.  One is a humanoid insect.  His costume was made by spray painting cardboard with enamel and it was destroyed when it got rained on!  A furry monster looks like the sort of outfit Gene Simmons of KISS might wear to a Halloween party right down to the 24 inch platform boots.  The last is the best, a stop motion animated something-or-other that is invisible for most of the movie but who finally materializes for the end.  They forgot, or could not afford, to matte out the background so the thing is transparent for all its scenes. Is that all?  Not nearly!  How about live music from a musician called &quot;Lon Talbot&quot; and 2 go-go girls who dance like they are on Valium? How about an alien who wear blue jeans and looks like his skin is made of wicker?  Jinkies this movie is an instant classic!  I loved it! Don Dohler made other films but this one is the most fun.  Can we take Edward D. Wood off that pedastal now and put Don Dohler in his place?  His films deserve to be seen and talked about; especially this one."

Walter Hill, one of the best action directors ever, is at the helm of this movie, which automatically makes it worth a look.\n\nThe movie concerns a couple of hick fire fighters (Bill Paxton and Bill Sadler, in great roles): one a classic hick, the other a borderline psycho, chasing treasure in the ghetto. They eventually cross paths with some big-time G&apos;s (gangsters) led by Ice-T and Ice Cube.\n\nThe story still sounds familiar, and for Hill it is a return to certain familiar territory. Like many of his pictures the movie centers around machismo and male posturing, but not since Hill&apos;s 48HRS had he done a film that contained some subtle social commentary on race relations, and paranoid stereotyping. There are fierce gun battles as expected, and the story is never boring. &quot;Die Hard in the Ghetto&quot; , may have been an equally suitable title.\n\nThe movie is tense , funny and great, and sadly, was ignored at the box-office during its&apos; Christmas 1992 release. Fortunately, it has been immortalized on home video and DVD."

      "reviewBody": "¨Call me JOE¨\n\nAs a kid I was a huge fan of the GI Joe cartoons and had a vast collection of the action figures, but I never thought it was a very good idea to bring the franchise to the big screen. I didn&apos;t like the first film despite all the great special effects because the entire concept was just way too silly, and I didn&apos;t like this film all that much either despite the fact it had a better story and some more interesting characters. What really saved this film for me was a ten minute action scene in the mountains which was pretty amazing and made the entire movie worthwhile. It was one of the best action scenes I&apos;ve seen all year. This second film was directed by Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber Never Say Never and Step Up 2) and the screenplay co-written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Zombieland), but very few actors are back from the original movie (only five) so this felt like a totally different movie. Retaliation is much better than Rise of Cobra but it still felt a little light due to the nonstop action. It&apos;s one of those movies you can enjoy for two hours but forget about once it&apos;s over. What it does have going for it is that is includes better action stars like The Rock and Bruce Willis. The Rock is probably one of the best contemporary action stars and he already brought the Fast and Furious franchise back alive again. He doesn&apos;t quite do the same with GI Joe, but he still makes this movie a little more enjoyable than the original one. Despite all the cheesiness of the plot I still had some fun, and the producers knew that the premise couldn&apos;t be taken seriously so they just played around with it.\n\nThe Joes continue to serve and protect the world under the leadership of Captain Duke (Channing Tatum) and his team which consists of Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). They have a couple of successful missions until the team is betrayed by the US president (Jonathan Pryce) who is actually Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) infiltrated as him. Thus the Joes are forced to fight enemy forces inside their own government and are forced to receive help from the only person they can trust: retired General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis). Meanwhile Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) has conceived a plan with Firefly (Ray Stevenson) to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey). Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is determined to stop him with the help of Jinx (Elodie Yung), but the Joes are running out of time with the President threatening the world with a nuclear war. Will the Joes be able to stop the Cobra team before they destroy the entire world?\n\nChanning Tatum and The Rock shared some funny scenes together and had great chemistry, but I would have enjoyed more screen time with them. Adrianne Palicki looked great in that red dress and was a good addition to the film. Cotrona and Willis didn&apos;t do much, but the highlight of the film was the mountain action sequence between Park and Lee. The film had its extremely cheesy moments, and I couldn&apos;t believe they even didn&apos;t care about the explosion of London. They continued as if nothing ever happened and celebrated the success of the mission without considering the devastating loss. I think that was probably the worst part of the film and the entire scene was probably used to attract people through the trailers. Retaliation is big and loud, anticipation for what is to come in the blockbuster summer movies. By the time summer gets here we will probably have forgotten all about this movie, but it was still a fun and entertaining two hours. Even those people that will end up hating this film will have to agree that the ten minute action scene between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was pretty entertaining. As long as you don&apos;t think too much about what&apos;s going on you might enjoy this senseless film.",

      "reviewBody": "I bought the Second Run DVD, after reading about how this epic was considered the best Czech film, ever.\n\nTo be honest, not many other contenders spring to mind. And, who voted? As it was on special offer and I am a sucker indeed for that Russian style of gritty monochrome composition and beauty, how could I resist?\n\nI&apos;m on its second play and I&apos;m no nearer following the story. There is undoubtedly one. Am I too overawed by imagery that I could only dream of? (even if I were able to!) Is it the savagery and feel of a certain reality?\n\nI don&apos;t know. I can sense, however, an art film made with passion and unbounded imagination. Of folklore, both in a historical sense and a cultural one and of religious rebellion. Like Kurosawa at his best, an immediacy and connection. Yet, it is also dreamlike and distant, with an air of mysticism that I found increasingly confusing. The length of film means that by halfway through I&apos;ve no idea what is going on, but am still enjoying what I see.\n\nUnfortunately, I have docked a mark for the forced, electronically induced echo on the dialogue that probably is supposed to denote that other worldly strangeness. It seems to seep in and hang about, its constant use here cheapens the effect to being a bit of a pain. Whereas Kurosawa used that SFX so effectively on, say Roshomon, by using just once or twice.\n\nI could see elements of the Brazilian &apos;Black God, White Devil&apos; and like others have commented, Kurosawa&apos;s &apos;Seven Samurai&apos; and Tarkov&apos;s &apos;Andrei Rublev&apos;. Maybe some of the black magic in Bergman&apos;s late medieval classics, such as &apos;The Virgin Spring&apos; and &apos;The Seventh Seal&apos;. But more psychotic, more manic and disturbing than all these put together. Like madness itself, there is a real beauty deeply ingrained amongst the mayhem.\n\nMy conclusion would have to be that if you get the chance, go for it. Take it with a large pinch of salt and sprinkle sparingly. None of it is truly horrific or unpalatable to most adults and don&apos;t worry if you don&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;. Be slightly proud and immodest that you&apos;ve found a tarnished gem that hardly anyone else will have seen or are ever likely to.",

      "reviewBody": "I was too young for Woodstock, but I heard of it spoken in reverent tones over the years. I also heard great things about Michael Wadleigh&apos;s 1970 documentary-concert. Despite this, I put off seeing the film. Maybe because I thought it was going to be some roll-your-eyes groovy experience, man. I don&apos;t know, but I didn&apos;t get around to viewing it until the late 90s and I was blown away. I&apos;ve seen it three or four more times since then and it always has the same awe-inspiring effect.\n\nThe concert took place over 3.5 days in mid-August, 1969, at the height of the Vietnam fiasco and the counterculture movement. Twice as many people attended than expected and it was the biggest gathering of people in one place in history, about 400,000, only beat by the infamous Isle of Wight concert in England a year later.\n\nThe film shows the good and bad of the hippie culture. Generally speaking, the movement was a reaction against the Vietnam war and the sterile legalism that America and similar countries had devolved into by the early-mid 60s. The youth wanted freedom, peace and love and you can see this in the movie. It was a good thing. Yet you can also see the bad -- like the bad acid situation (&quot;Hey, it&apos;s your trip, man...&quot;). Both Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix appear at Woodstock, and they&apos;re great, but they&apos;ll be dead in a little over a year, both only 27 years-old. Jim Morrison and the Doors didn&apos;t play because they declined at the last moment and later regretted it. Jim died shortly after the other two, also only 27. Interestingly, Jethro Tull declined because Ian Anderson didn&apos;t like hippies and was concerned about things like inappropriate nudity (?!).\n\nBut I don&apos;t mean to put a downer on Woodstock because it was an amazing event, never to be repeated. They tried to repeat it at Altamont Speedway in California, less than four months after Woodstock, and also at Isle of Wight, but both festivals turned out badly and put the the kibosh on the movement&apos;s noble ideals, even though it was pretty much inevitable since freedom without wise parameters naturally devolves into chaos and self-destruction.\n\nRegardless, as a snapshot in time, &quot;Woodstock&quot; is fascinating and supremely entertaining. Half of the appeal is the incredible magnitude of the event itself and the footage of the people -- the hippies who came and the adults who lived there and tried to help or, in a couple cases, complained. This includes the fun and sometimes outrageous escapades of the festival. A good example would be the skinny dipping or, in many cases, semi-skinny dipping. Although this may have been a cool experiment at the event it never caught-on in the culture at large. Why? Probably because few people want to see someone else&apos;s Captain Winky and, unless a female has the body of a starlet, who wants to see it? (lol).\n\nBut what can explain the mass appeal of Woodstock? What made the hippies come out en masse? Was it just the music? The filmmakers ask this very question of a guy at the festival who looks about 16-17 years old. He says it wasn&apos;t just the music, at least not for him. The hippies crawled out of the woodwork, so to speak, like zombies seeking some kind of solace, a sense of community, a reason to... live. And Woodstock met that need. \n\nThe other half of the appeal is, of course, the performances and music. What&apos;s amazing is how diversified the styles of music were and how non-heavy. Don&apos;t get me wrong, many of the performances are seriously energetic, but they&apos;re light compared to what rock/metal evolved into in the 70s to the present. There was acoustic folk, Caribbean, blues, rock, gospel, pop, 50s, Latin rock, jazz fusion and psychedelic rock. Some of it I like and some of it I don&apos;t much care for, but they&apos;re all entertaining in one way or another. Since I&apos;m into metal, my favorites are Santana, The Who and Jimi Hendrix, but I also enjoy a lot of the lighter stuff, like Joan Baez (&quot;Swing Low Sweet Chariot&quot;) and Arlo Guthrie (&quot;Coming into Los Angeles&quot;). And then there are the acts that come out of left field, like Sly and the Family Stone and Sha Na Na, even Ritchie Havens.\n\nWhat&apos;s amazing is how brief the classic hippie era was. It started around &apos;65 and its apex was Woodstock in August &apos;69, a mere four years later. From there it was all downhill with Altamont, Isle of Wight and the deaths of the movement&apos;s principal musical icons. As such, it only lasted some eight years.\n\nThankfully, we have this film to see the good aspects of the period -- some bad, some eye-rolling -- but mostly good, and definitely entertaining.\n\nThe film was shot in White Lake, New York, and runs 184 minutes while the 1994 Director&apos;s Cut runs 225 minutes. I&apos;ve only seen the latter.\n\nGRADE: A",

      "reviewBody": "Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a &quot;pre-crime&quot; unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.\n\nWe learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.\n\nSpielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black &amp; white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noir&apos;s morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.\n\nBut this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that&apos;s going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.\n\nThis is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.\n\n&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; ~ film noir &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; ~ science fiction &quot;Blade Runner&quot; ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)\n\n***** out of *****"

      "reviewBody": "I went to a preview screening of this film, so the version I saw may not make it onto the screen. I was pretty hesitant when I heard that Mr. Diesel was in it. I have to report that he did justice to the role. OK, he was no young Al Pacino, but he was certainly better than the old Al Pacino would be in the role. And Pacino has to be the patron saint of the film. His performance could have been loud, it could have been slick, instead he adds surprising depth to an essentially obnoxious character.\n\nThe story isn&apos;t surprising, but it does carry a bit of a cultural wallop, and Deisel, using dialog drawn from actual courtroom testimony is able to convey a real sense of outrage over being societal discrimination. It is a testimony to Lumet&apos;s direction, that the film never veers into the didactic or preachy.\n\nThe real surprise to me was Annabella Sciorra. The print I saw had no credits, so I wasn&apos;t expecting her and it took me a bit to place her face. She was electrifying. She truly lit up the screen in her 5 minutes. In an extended dialog with Diesel as her husband, she goes from dispassion, to jealousy, to outrage, to sexual hunger in the most nuanced and natural performance I have seen in a long while. Sciorra is a major talent and needs to get some larger roles, maybe even a few where she isn&apos;t the Wife/Fiancée of a N.J. mobster.",

Curtis&apos; sexy arrangement is discovered by envious old pal Jerry Lewis (as Robert Reed). Mr. Lewis plots to take over the satisfying arrangement of women, after he learns Curtis may be transferred to New York. But, both men are threatened when the stewardesses&apos; flight patterns change; and, everyone heads for the apartment bed! \n\nFunnier than its reputation; perhaps, the film&apos;s celebration of pseudo-promiscuity distanced it from other sixties sex comedies - the &quot;romance&quot; between Lewis and Suzanna Leigh (as Vicky &quot;British United&quot; Hawkins) comes closest to &quot;acceptable&quot; for the genre. The other two women, hefty knockwurst-loving Christiane Schmidtmer (as Lise &quot;Lufthansa&quot; Bruner) and wispy soufflé-loving Dany Saval (as Jacqueline &quot;Air France&quot; Grieux), are more funny than romantic. Curtis is finely frantic; however, Lewis, in a lower key, and Thelma Ritter (as Bertha) are more outstanding.\n\n****** Boeing Boeing (12/22/65) John Rich ~ Tony Curtis, Jerry Lewis, Thelma Ritter, Dany Saval",

(Five Weeks In a Balloon) The turn of century period setting is pleasantly brought to life by expert director Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia.Toto plays his part (a baron who hoards a treasure chest full of valuable jewels supposed to help build an elementary school) to the hilt, constantly reminding fellow citizens that he really has no money and that any time there is a cost, &quot;Io pago!&quot; (I land up paying) Silvia Pampanini lends able support as a pretty traveling music hall singer cajoled into pretending to be a phantom spirit who will guide the supposedly dead Toto in the afterlife to...the hidden box of wealth.",

Ray Milland is very good as a man battling a recent personal tragedy, who must then also try to sort out a series of mysterious and hazardous events in which he has suddenly become involved.\n\nThere are a lot of characters, and the story gets a bit complicated at times, making use of the W.W.II setting while introducing some quirky elements which generally come across pretty well.  There are also a couple of good surprises, and for most of the way you have to guess along with Milland&apos;s character as to what will happen next.  As with most such films, you must occasionally suspend disbelief, but that does not really detract from the atmosphere and tension.\n\nIf you enjoy film noir and/or thrillers, give this one a try.  It&apos;s not one of the best of its genre, but it moves quickly and works well, at least as light entertainment."

The Clash footage is great, the sound is really good. The character Ray is very believable and a realistic portrayal of the hangers on that bands attract and can&apos;t seem to get rid of! Even though the acting ain&apos;t great. So while most of the film&apos;s value is historic and sociological in nature, it does hold the attention.\n\nWell done to London Live for finding this one!",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Tender is the Night&apos; remains one of F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s most important works, but, sadly, he, today, is not recognized as one of America&apos;s truly formidable writers. Film representations have not always worked, but his characterizations are etched superbly when given to the right performer e.g. Alan Ladd&apos;s extraordinary depiction in &apos;The Great Gatsby&apos;. The film of &apos;Tender is the Night&apos; had been criticized for all the wrong reasons, one of them, perhaps, relating to the fact that some critics continued to misinterpret the work of Jennifer Jones, surely as fine an actress of the era as is Meryl Streep today. Perhaps Selznick did limit her access to some of the best scripts offered, but, here, in &apos;Tender&apos;, she is still so absolutely right in every movement and shading of Nicole&apos;s character. Jason Robards, a brilliant actor, may not have been perfectly cast, but Joan Fontaine, in the latter part of her career, expertly captures the selfish, ego-involved woman of the era. Jill St. John and Tom Ewell are only adequate, but, in total, the film works because of the expert script, the cinematography, the music, King&apos;s direction, and the ever-important work of Fontaine and Jones. Both of these women essayed numerous kinds of roles in their careers. Here, Jennifer Jones is still in top form, and the film deserves to be reevaluated.",

      "reviewBody": "Steve Jobs(R.I.P) October,5th,2011. \n\njOBS is not a biography movie like Citizen Kane, Gandhi, The Last Emperor, The Last King of Scotland, Malcolm X, and Gladiator. But it takes all the genre clichés from these movies, while following the same story structure of Social Network. \n\nSince I mentioned David Fincher&apos;s movie Social Network, I will start my review with the major problem in jOBS: Considering Social Network was an aptly marketed everyone&apos;s hero style of an average business-drama movie, in order to market a Steve Jobs life story appropriately, this wasn&apos;t the right choice. The cause of this marketing errors are the trailer, the poster with Ashton Kutcher on it, and the movie itself with Ashton Kutcher starring in it. \n\nThen what is jOBS about? jOBS is just a simple telling of a person&apos;s epoch-making achievement like Schindler&apos;s List, Spartacus, Raging Bull, Braveheart, Papillon, The Pianist, and even David Lnych&apos;s The Straight Story. jOBS has more than a few things in common with those movies including the pain of sacrificing your beloved ones in order to succeed in your career, including similar character traits, similar ethical beliefs, similar moral decisions. jOBS is only a brief telling of what Steve Jobs gave to the Macintosh computers, just like what Oscar Schindler gave to Jews, and what Braveheart gave to Scotland. You can&apos;t expect to see the birth and death of Steve Jobs in this movie. This is not a biopic, instead it&apos;s a drama, poorly marketed good business-drama. \n\nThere are both strong and weak points in the technical side of jOBS. As a start, having no narration is a strong point, yet having not explained why Steve Jobs dropped out from college is crucially a weak point. Ashton Kutcher takes his girlfriend and goes behind bushes in the country and smokes weed. Then we get to figure it out that Steve Jobs has dropped out from college because he smoked weed and got his girlfriend pregnant. Refusing the birth of his first child due to his busy work schedules, Steve Jobs character has been made more weaker and weaker minute after minute. There is certainly a rule of character growth followed in this film, but none of this film&apos;s audiences have really bought that character growing incidents. \n\nThis is an average business-drama movie, set in the world of entrepreneurial minds. You&apos;re lonely, you always keep a positive mind but always looking for a person to trust, you are goal-oriented, you take maximum risks for every little achievements in your life, you are a reliable friend to your colleagues but they are always afraid of you, and you see every step in your life as a competition with someone else&apos;s steps in their lives... \n\nThis is a strong premise that killed the sense of making a Steve Jobs movie to honor his memory. This movie should have been made in 1997, when Steve Jobs have become the de facto chief CEO of Macintosh. And this movie could have been titled &quot;Think Differently&quot; as this is what it is only about. If this has been a movie called &quot;Think Differently&quot; made in 1997, then it could earn some recognition. Now people would come to you and ask &quot;What did Steve Jobs do for the last 14 years of his life as a CEO in Apple?&quot;",

Charlie Sheen, Valeria Golino, Cary Elwes, and Lloyd Bridges provide the starring roles, and are all hilarious in every scene they carry.\n\nFor some people, this type of humor is childish and won&apos;t elicit much more than a simple chuckle. For others (myself included), though, the sight gags and hilarious physical comedy will have you in tears of laughter. The chemistry between Sheen and Golino is incredible, Elwes is at his maniacal best, while Bridges basically steals the show as the hilarious old general who always seems to save the day in the end.\n\nThis is a film that is kind of hard to explain in print. You really just need to sit down and watch it to determine if it is the right kind of comedy for you. You&apos;ll know within the first few minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "Gary, for that movie, was Doc Joe Frail. Maria, sister of Maximilian Schell, became Elizabeth Malher. Everything that happened to Frail seemed real. He healed Elizabeth&apos;s blindness but feared loving her because of his past. There was the guilt from the tragedy he carried, the fear of someone finding out. The jealousy and anger of people waiting and wanting to take Doc&apos;s life for his past and, mostly, the fortune. \n\nFrenchy Plante is played by Karl Malden. He is a fortune hunter with a drinking problem. Karl was one of two directors who made this film. Delmar Daves was in charge of the beginning and middle. Karl did the finishing work. By that time, Mulden had 20 movies under his belt.\n\nGeorge C. Scott is Dr. George Grubb, a Bible toting, Scripture spouting fiend. He is not a particularly nice person. He targets Doc Frail and goes after him. This is Scott&apos;s first credited role and he carries it off very well.\n\nJerry Livingston does the title theme. &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;. It was sung in the movie by one of my favorites, Marty Robbins. He, also, made it popular to the public through radio and records. Now I have a CD of &quot;The Best of Marty Robbins&quot; that I have introduced to my grandson. I want him (and our other grandkids) to know about something besides today&apos;s music.\n\nJust for some aside information: The only cast member, of this movie, still living is Karl Malden. He turned 94 in March of 2006. Wow, what a life he&apos;s had!"

      "reviewBody": "PUSHOVER is an underrated, little known crime melodrama from the mid-&apos;50s that introduced the blonde beauty of KIM NOVAK to audiences and gave FRED MacMURRAY another chance to play an authority figure seduced by the charms of a femme fatale. When the story begins, it turns out his accidental meeting with Novak was really a set-up, he being a cop assigned to keep track of her whereabouts after a bank hold-up results in the death of a police officer.\n\nHe suspects that her mobster boyfriend pulled the job and at first resists when she tries to convince him they can use the bank money for themselves. But eventually, he weakens and before you know it he&apos;s informing her that her phone is wire tapped and the two of them are just one step ahead of the police for the rest of the film.\n\nPHIL CAREY, as a fellow officer and E.G. MARSHALL as the lead detective are excellent in supporting roles, as is DOROTHY MALONE in a pivotal role as a girl occupying the apartment next to Novak in a U-shaped building that enables MacMurray and Carey to keep an eye on both gals through binoculars (shades of REAR WINDOW).\n\nConveniently, no one ever draws the blinds in these sort of thrillers and spying is made so easy for the sake of plotting, as the 24-hour surveillance occupies much of the story. The noir elements are present throughout, the dark rainy streets, the shadowy photography during car chases, the clipped delivery of lines, the murder scheme gone awry, the femme fatale angelic on the outside, bad within.\n\nBut somehow it never becomes a major film noir, relegated to its place in obscurity over the years and not really a title that pops up when one speaks of film noir--but it does qualify as noir, on a minor scale, and it&apos;s given some taut direction and tight suspense by director Richard Quine.\n\nKim is as easy as ever on the eyes although a bit robotic in her acting technique and never quite convincing as a mobster&apos;s moll. MacMurray has a less interesting, more one-dimensional role as a cop corrupted by beauty.\n\nAll in all, definitely worth watching.",

Imagine that for just a moment - what would you do if you were told you got to do the one thing you&apos;ve loved since you were a child and share that with the world?

And this film&apos;s heart is bigger than any blockbuster on the market. That counts for something. I don&apos;t want to be elitist and say that if you don&apos;t like this film then you just don&apos;t get it, because honestly that&apos;s too easy. I&apos;ll say instead that if you don&apos;t like this film, then you simply haven&apos;t seen enough movies. Enough to know the difference between a movie made for profit versus a movie made for sheer love and devotion for the medium; for the idea and for the experience. Those movies are not for everyone, they can&apos;t be. They&apos;re for the ones of us who enjoy the unique and random exposure to something original and are willing to take a chance that it might be a total bomb. The zombie genre isn&apos;t original. But this film is. And it made this fan feel like a kid again. That is why I love it, why I own it, and why I re-watch it often.",

      "reviewBody": "Before I start this comment, I might take a minute to state that I know very little about the country of Albania, nor about the communist politics that go on in that state. Living in a big city in a capitalist country, interpreting this film is somewhat difficult and can be called into question, at least as far as I&apos;m concerned. So bear that in mind as I write.\n\nThe film &quot;Slogans&quot; is set in a remote Albanian village, in a communist state. It is viewed primarily through the eyes of Andre, a young teacher recently arrived in the town and hence under constant scrutiny from the citizens. The plot revolves largely around him and his fellow teachers as they lead their students in building huge slogans for the communist party in rocks on the side of a hill. If this plot intrigues you in a slightly whimsical kind of way, you&apos;ll know what my motivation was to watch it in the first place.\n\nOn the surface, the plot seems to be nothing more than a tale of alienation and politics revolving around the somewhat tedious occupation of building these slogans from rocks and painting the rocks to make them stand out. But deeper down there are more inner workings.\n\nThe way I see it, the film is simply a satirical piece on the failure and hollowness of communism as a governing rule. The slogans are symbolic of this; the whole job is done for the purposes of this supposedly wonderfully fulfilling pursuit, but in the end, all they are is just words. The fact that so much of the plot revolves around these words seems to suggest that, in a similar way, the communist system itself revolves around words and little more. The brave and inspirational words are supposed to incite the masses to enthusiasm, and yet, as the film illustrates, the words are so fragile that a simple flow of rain or the trotting of goats can unsettle them and they lose all meaning.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting to note the other ways in which the writers have stressed the importance of words (ie. propaganda) in the workings of the Party. It is done mainly through the use of single, isolated aspects of the story. Firstly, the fact that there is only one character who retains notoriety for being a detractor, an enemy, of the communist Party, and that character happens to be illiterate; in other words, he can&apos;t read the slogans and therefore can&apos;t rally around them like the masses do. Secondly, the fact that, despite relying largely on school and teaching for its story, there is only essentially one scene actually set in a classroom, and it too involves nothing but reciting communist propaganda, and when the boy in question makes an honest mistake, his words are misinterpreted and an entire investigation is set up as a result.\n\nThe pathos present in these, among other aspects of this film, is what gives it its comedy and hence its satire. That said, while the examination of communism is very interesting, the film itself fails a little to really engage me. The comedy is there, but it isn&apos;t funny. The drama is there, but it isn&apos;t moving. I just don&apos;t think the right atmosphere was created to actually captivate me; there is very little music used to set the mood, and the acting isn&apos;t quite good enough to compensate. Similarly, the subplot of the romance between Andre and Diana doesn&apos;t quite work for me; there just appears to be no development of this relationship and so when it is consummated there is very little chemistry between the two. It just comes off as incomplete.\n\nThe only real drama is the subtle message of the sadness and worthlessness of this life; Andre is used as contrast, the voice of wisdom as it were, between this essentially brainwashed community and the outside, more civilised world. But in the end, the schoolkids, like the adults, are simply forced to completely immerse themselves in a lifestyle that serves only the purposes of the party (with free will eliminated from the equation), and in more ways than one the film illustrates the fact that this is an endless cycle. And to an external viewer, that&apos;s quite sad to see.\n\nIn summary, the film, and script in particular, are very cleverly worked to examine the life and politics of this isolated village. It is in the execution of the story where it fails to impress, but as far as I can see, that matters very little since I love a film with intricate underlying themes. As a political foray, it&apos;s close to perfect. As a film, it isn&apos;t. In very simple terms, four stars out of five.",

      "name": "D Day for Pacino",
      "reviewBody": "By the time Sidney Lumet&apos;s &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose. Forget the holdbacks of &quot;Serpico&quot;; here we get a glimpse into the real Al, the actor who would bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking in some of his lesser characters.\n\nThere&apos;s essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a character, and here he&apos;s the character, and it works splendidly. Al Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and a talentless director, which has been happening a lot lately, although fortunately his comparison, De Niro, has been lucky enough to generally avoid these blunders of older-age film-making.\n\nThis is based on a true story, like &quot;Serpico,&quot; only it&apos;s better and more involving. It connects with the audience more than &quot;Serpico&quot; because it doesn&apos;t jump through the same old hoops; it goes for the long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind it been lazy. The clichés are gone and the originality creeps in early on. Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in. It&apos;s more touching than it seems at first.\n\nPacino is Sonny Wortzik, a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in order to pay for his &quot;wife&apos;s&quot; operation. The wife is actually Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon who was Oscar-nominated for this, his first role in a mainstream film), Sonny&apos;s gay lover who doesn&apos;t have the money for a sex operation.\n\nThe bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema&apos;s greatest bad guys once described as a quick &quot;in and out,&quot; but Sonny gets held up inside the bank and soon he&apos;s all over the news and police are standing outside the building with guns drawn. It&apos;s like Denzel&apos;s movie only better and more original. Oh, and true. This one actually happened and we can tell.\n\nSonny&apos;s partner in crime, Sal (John Cazale), is worried that he&apos;ll be treated as a homosexual by the media outside. His fretting is comic relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience. Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation. His performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale&apos;s.\n\nPacino&apos;s performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic. He&apos;d display this same talent in &quot;Scarface&quot; again eight years later; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top. (Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence, just like Mel Gibson&apos;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.)\n\nThere&apos;s also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that rivals Montana&apos;s Last Stand in &quot;Scarface&quot; or the Baptism Scene in &quot;The Godfather,&quot; which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his &quot;wife,&quot; carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby. Watch Pacino delve into character here and you&apos;re immediately hooked. We like his character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real, and that&apos;s why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of all time.\n\nIs this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex change operations? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be increasingly invaded by the images of gay men? No. This is Hollywood showing us a true story, regardless of the homosexuality. Pacino could be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the movie affect us, not the background of its characters.\n\nSarandon&apos;s Oscar nomination was more than worthy; here he displays the smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years to come. Prince Humperdink from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is equally memorable but less realistic. Here he seems more real, which is good for this film and would have been quite bad for &quot;Bride.&quot; We don&apos;t like real characters in fantasy tales, do we?\n\nLumet, who ruined &quot;Serpico&quot; with his bad editing, out-of-place music, clichéd dialogue/events and unnecessary scenes, directs &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly heartfelt sense of emotion and care. This isn&apos;t exactly a good example of a perfect motion picture but it&apos;s pretty close.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m just not buying into the bad rating for this film, in 1996 Wes Craven&apos;s Scream reinvigorated an ailing genre and got fans back into the horror groove. The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.\n\nSidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...\n\nThe film&apos;s opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It&apos;s a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it&apos;s just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey &amp; Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he&apos;s hero or villain.\n\nThis is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.\n\nScream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Rather than be redundant with other reviews, I will simply say, Cosmic Journey (Kosmicheskii Reys: Fantasticheskaya - literally, Space Flights: A Fantastic Story) is an ntertaining, fascinating piece of cinematic &amp; cultural history. As with many Soviet science fiction movies of later decades, such as Nebo Zovyot, aka The Sky Calls (1959), and Mechte Navstrechu, aka A Dream Come True (1963), Cosmic Journey is an optimistic vision of space exploration, both with regard to the endeavor itself, and with respect to camaraderie among Soviet citizens and scientists, even if there are initially disputes with respect to motives and methods.\n\nAs an aside, I ordered a copy of this movie from Amazon from a distribution company called Video Dimensions. It&apos;s a 2011 DVD. The picture has the kind of artifacts one would expect from an older, unrestored film, but it is nonetheless very passible. It is a silent movie even though it was released in 1936. The orchestral accompaniment doesn&apos;t seem to have been written for the movie, and seems to be instead needle drops of classical pieces. They are matched pretty well with the action though, so it works. Intertitles are in Russian with English subtitles.)",

They are as different in approach and intent as are &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;The Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; which both happen to be set in the same prison.\n\n&quot;EDtv&quot; is meant to be a comedy with a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to the intrusive nature of the media.  The characters are very engaging and well-acted.  I laughed all the way through this movie.  That&apos;s all I think it was supposed to be.  \n\nIt isn&apos;t quite as good as &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; or &quot;Analyze This&quot;, but I still give it 8 of 10!!"

      "reviewBody": "Much like other sexploitation films of this period, looking back on them can be quaint. They have plenty of nudity, but it&apos;s not as if they ever get into hardcore sex. This adaptation of Dorian Gray promises tons of sex and depravity, but its fairly chaste when all is said and done. What&apos;s most surprising about it is that it&apos;s not a half bad adaptation of the Oscar Wilde story from which it&apos;s based.\n\nHelmut Berger plays Dorian Gray, an impossibly beautiful young man who falls for an actress named Sybil, but as he starts to make it way up through the London society crowd, he no longer has much use for Sybil and after he discards her, she kills herself. This leads Dorian to harden and only rely on his looks until people begin to get suspicious as to why he never seems to age after many years. Perhaps the secret involves a painting hidden away in his attic.\n\nDespite adding in some sex and nudity to spice things up, this version of Dorian Gray plays out, more or less, like the original story. It might dwell in the sexual depravity a bit more than most adaptations, but at least it works for the story it&apos;s telling. It&apos;s a bit slow at times, but at least it&apos;s trying to tell a somewhat interesting story.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard to tell just how striking &quot;Rashômon&quot; might have seemed to those who watched it in 1950, rather than seeing it after so many subsequent movies and other works have made use of its techniques and ideas. But it&apos;s clear that it is a technical and creative success. The story itself is not particularly satisfying, which was most likely by design, and the movie is carried by its structure and by the concept of the markedly different perspectives on the same series of events. The cast also deserve their share of credit for how well it works, and the photography is excellent, as it is in almost all of Kurosawa&apos;s films.\n\nKurosawa&apos;s expertise makes the interwoven sequences of past and present - essentially telling two different stories - not only work flawlessly, but fit together thematically. It&apos;s even more commendable when compared to some of the subsequent films that have tried to use similar ideas, only to come off as pretentious rather than creative or innovative. Kurosawa was also working with much less in terms of possible precedents.\n\nIn one sense, the choice of specific story material could seem a little odd.\n\nThe downbeat, rather sordid scenario makes the movie somewhat less enjoyable than several of Kurosawa&apos;s other pictures (which is, admittedly, a pretty high standard), and as a result &quot;Rashômon&quot; is more a film to respect and admire than one to enjoy and take pleasure from. Still, it does have significantly more substance to it than do most of the more recent pictures that have been deliberately downbeat or negative in their portrayals of humanity. Such stories are more trendy at present, and they often receive undue praise simply for so being.\n\nAt the same time, the lack of sympathetic characters and the paucity of hopeful developments bring out all the more its success in developing its ideas about narrative and about reality, ideas that are more fundamental and, in their way, perhaps at least as important as any specific story or events."

Of course it turns the other way around. The film starts with his corpse being carried off an airplane and Gregory escorting a very depressed wife down from it, then concentrating on Gregory to deal with the aftermath of the matter in the shape of hangover thoughts, turning to a long flashback, which is the major part of the film. Was it an accident or was it murder? Neither Joan Bennett nor Gregory Peck can anser that question, which will follow you out.\n\nHunting wild animals, especially when they are of the noble kind like lions, must be perhaps the most despicable sport in the world, especially today, when so many of those finest animals are facing extinction, but this film shows clearly the rotten turpidity and destructive meaninglessness of it as a sport. There is some comfort in that nowadays safari tourists don&apos;t shoot animals except by cameras, but there are still abominable poachers around, that should be shot themselves, everyone of them.",

The falseness and banality of these sketch-like scenes conflict awkwardly with the pseudo-documentary discussions of female sexuality that the director inserts with great earnestness throughout the film.\n\nThe film&apos;s saving grace is Marie Gillain, who pulls off the near-impossible task of making the infuriating, egotistical Louise both watchable and sympathetic."

      "reviewBody": "This film is a lost musical parody treasure that could bear to be rediscovered. Operetta meets swing, and the conventions of cross-dressing and sexual gender confusion gets the Comedia della arte treatment.\n\nLilian Harvey plays a young heiress in long-ago France (the costumes are Empire and Regency)named Madelon whose grandfather brings her up as one would a young man, so that she can make it alone and rebuff all who would chase her for fortune.\n\nUpon the grandfather&apos;s death, she is fooled by her guardian into a betrothal with a fat prefect when she is deceptively shown a picture of his young and good-looking rogue cousin. Before the wedding can take place, Madelon discovers the ruse and escapes in the disguise of a page boy.\n\nOn the road, she coincidentally meets the attractive young cousin and his best friend, who have just left the wedding celebration. The three become comrades after a scuffle with some ruffians and then set off on many adventures, including a visit to a brothel, during all of which the two men are under the impression that Madelon is a young man. After some problem with the law, they are all brought into court where all must be resolved.\n\nThis film is as light and fun as a soufflé--a terrific riff on operettas and the gender-switching gimmick. Lilian Harvey is in top form-and the film is whimsical, beautifully decorated and somewhat weird-at one point Harvey sings an entire song about her love affairs with women, dressed in male drag to a group of enrapt ladies of the night in a salon.\n\nThe musical numbers are both wonderful and weird--There&apos;s a very strange number in which a mother sings a song about the supposed rape of her daughter in order to compromise Harvey&apos;s character (whom she thinks is a young duke) into marriage. She sings the song pleasantly and jauntily trills the word &quot;vergewaltigt&quot; over and over.\n\nThe pacing is great and Viktor Staal is the perfect rogue leading man for Harvey. It&apos;s a pity they were not paired again. The film was hated by Hitler and Goebbels, but the director was powerful and it was released to glowing reviews and an enthusiastic public. After a very short time in theatres, it was pulled out of circulation.",

Yes, the main body of the story is rather a simple one but anyway the ride makes fun and is entertaining. I should add that I never read one of the original stories written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (note to myself: read one), so it is possible that readers and fans of the original stories, like some other reviews indicate, may be disappointed by the movie adaption.",

      "reviewBody": "Until ironically both stars of The Iron Petticoat died within a month of each other in 2003, this film may have had until June 29 of that year of holding the record for having its two co-stars survive the longest. That was the day Katharine Hepburn died and Bob Hope died on July 27 and between them they had 196 years on earth. That&apos;s the only distinction The Iron Petticoat has.\n\nBen Hecht got on Bob Hope&apos;s case for allowing his gag writers to intrude in on his screenplay and story. Personally I can&apos;t believe they could have loused it up as bad as what his idea originally was. Katharine Hepburn is a female Russian jet ace who defects from the Soviet Union, not because of any disagreement with Communism, but because she was passed over for promotion in the Russian Air Force.\n\nBut the Americans still think they can convert her for propaganda purposes and who do they assign to the task? Not real life American air war hero James Stewart, but Bob Hope who plays the jet pilot who forced Kate&apos;s jet down. Who here really believes Bob Hope as a war hero pilot? \n\nIt&apos;s obvious Hope did interfere and it probably cost Hepburn some of her scenes, but the premise was so ridiculous I can understand why he thought the film needed help. As for Hepburn she throws on an accent that might be described as Maria Ouspenskaya on crystal meth. \n\nEven such fine players as James Robertson Justice as the KGB man assigned to kidnap Hepburn back are wasted here.\n\nThe Iron Petticoat was a terrible idea made even worse in the execution. No wonder it&apos;s never shown in revivals of either Hope or Hepburn.",

They make a big deal about how hostile the surface is and how no one could survive on it, but damn it he has to go out and fight the alien. Then they override the computer and open a hatch to ... the south western US! Now we get to see some dude in a suit walk around for like 5 minutes while they blow smoke infront of the camera to make you feel like your in an alien landscape. I believe you can even spot tire tracks on the ground and a rv in the back ground. Then we get a close up of the actor&apos;s face looking surprised, a close up of some purple weird dragon head going &apos;ROAAR&apos; and then the scene of the dude running back to the hatch.\n\nMy friends in I had to break down and start laughing, it was one of the most inexplicatble sequences in film since the burlesque scene in Glenn or Glenda."

The film offers a decent watch but falls short of delivering a truly engaging and memorable experience.\n\nThe story revolves around a New York City cop, Harley (Robert Urich), who relocates to a small desert town after a tragic incident. He soon finds himself entangled in a web of corruption, murder, and deceit, as he attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding the death of a local Native American activist. The film&apos;s premise is intriguing, and the potential for a gripping narrative is evident, but the execution leaves much to be desired.\n\nRudolph&apos;s direction is visually appealing, capturing the stark beauty of the desert with its wide, open spaces and desolate vistas. The cinematography effectively conveys the sense of isolation and disconnection experienced by the characters. However, the pacing is uneven, with scenes that linger too long and others that feel rushed and underdeveloped.\n\nThe performances are a mixed bag. Robert Urich delivers a solid portrayal of the tormented and determined Harley, but the supporting cast is inconsistent. JoBeth Williams, as Harley&apos;s wife, seems underutilized, while Paul Dooley&apos;s over-the-top performance as the local sheriff borders on caricature.\n\nOne notable aspect of the film is its exploration of the complex relationships between the Native American community, the local law enforcement, and the corrupt forces at play. It provides a thought-provoking commentary on the exploitation and marginalization of indigenous people, which adds depth to the narrative. However, this theme is not fully realized, and the film ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying resolution.\n\nThe score, composed by Mark Isham, is a standout feature, with its haunting, atmospheric melodies that perfectly complement the film&apos;s desolate setting and tense mood. Unfortunately, the soundtrack cannot compensate for the film&apos;s shortcomings in other areas.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Endangered Species&quot; is a film with unfulfilled potential. While it offers some compelling moments and a unique setting, it is ultimately let down by uneven performances, inconsistent pacing, and an underdeveloped narrative. For those with a particular interest in neo-noir thrillers or the films of Alan Rudolph, it may be worth a watch, but casual viewers might find it a disappointing endeavor.",

Since it was a very late silent,it had a vitaphone soundtrack and even a theme song.The film tells the story of the romance of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton The movie has some lovely visual moments. The most memorable being,the two lovers on a swing and a battle at sea. But the film is a little slow going  and the male lead is stiff and lacks charisma. Frank Lloyd is best remembered for the 1935 version of Mutiny on the Bounty, which shares with  this film,historical characters and sea experiences.However, Mutiny on the Bounty is a much better film. For the best version of the story of Hamilton and Nelson, see the wonderful,Vivian Leigh- Laurence Olivier-movie-That Hamilton Woman.",

      "reviewBody": "An intriguing film with plenty of twists and turns , dealing with an aging widow : Geraldine Page who carries out dark and sinister activities with grave consequences . As a poor , eccentric widow develops an awful habit to inherit states from old women by stealing their savings . Meanwhile , an elderly woman : Ruth Gordon takes a job in hopes of solving a mystery . Whatever happened to Aunt Alice was more terrifying than what happened to Baby Jane ! . The only evidence is a growing number of trees by the drive ! . You&apos;ll know ..when the horror starts to grow ! .What makes her garden grow ...wouldn&apos;t you like to know !\n\nThis is a horrific tale with high body-count , violence , thrills , chills , plot twists and portentous interpretations . It packs an adequate cinematography by Joseph Biroc , as well as moving musical score by Gerarld Fried . Main and support cast are frankly top-notch . As Geraldine Page is terrific as the suspect widow who hires maids and hides a deadly secret which she will do anything to keep buried . She is excellently accompanied by the always great Ruth Gordon -of Harold and Maude fame- as Mrs Dimmock acting there just as odd , along with the beautiful Rosemary Forsyth , Robert Fuller and especial appearance by Mildred Dunnock . This film belongs to a sub-genre developed in the Sixties and Seventies , dealing with deranged widows or unsettling spinsters , middle-age women who often commit grisly killings , whose main representatives were Robert Aldrich with his big hit &quot;What ever happened to Baby Jane ?&quot; Stars Bette Davis , Joan Crawford, &quot;Hush ...Hush Sweet Charlotte&quot; stars Olivia De Havilland , Bette Davis and Curtis Harrington with &quot;Whoever slew Auntiee Roo ?&quot; Stars Shelley Winters , &quot;What&apos;s the matter with Helen ?&quot; Stars Debbie Reynolds , Shelley Winters , &quot;The Killing Kind&quot; with Ann Sothern and &quot;Games&quot; with Simone Signoret .\n\nThe motion picture well produced by Robert Aldrich was competently directed by Lee H Katzin and direction assistant Bernard Girard , providing a tense and competetent filmmaking . Rating : 7/10 notable . Well worth watching . Essential and fundamental seeing for the awesome interpretations of the magnificent actresses .",

Besides having the benefit of seminating from proved pedigree, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; manages that rare distinction of actually being quite amusing despite succumbing to that very Korean Achilles&apos; heel of parental melodrama. The truest moments of pleasure primarily stems from its protagonist, Oh Dong-gu&apos;s (Ryu Deok-hwan) absurd responses to his chauvinistic reality, and his flights of fancy involving an attractive teacher. For the most part, the film does approach society without preconceptions allowing itself a fair bit of leeway for fluff and fantasy. There&apos;s a sense that its secondary characters become too much of a handful when there&apos;s a discernible, almost portentous shift in tone whenever Dong-gu&apos;s miserable louse of a father shows up, upsetting the thoughtful equilibrium of its comedy that does occasionally become reminiscent of Masayuki Suo&apos;s &quot;Sumo Do, Sumo Don&apos;t&quot;.",

I was a fan of the first Timecop, and I thought the follow-up maintained the good action scenes and fairly interesting storyline that the first one possessed.  There are also some nice effects throughout the movie which complement the movie well. For people who liked the original Timecop, I recommend that you at least rent the dvd.\n\nOn another note, I am glad to see Jason Scott Lee back in an action driven movie.  Dragon was one of my all time favorite movies, such a fine movie, and I was expecting to see Jason star in alot more movies than he has been thus far.  Hope to see more of him!\n\n Thanks,\n\n John"

      "name": "You can agree with the filmmakers and loathe the product",
      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve seen the trailer for Last Ounce of Courage, then you know the roots and the morals of the entire picture. Some films like to persuade the audience down a different direction and have them possess a different idea of the film in their trailers. Not this one. This film blatantly comes out and tells you what it is, what it strives to be, and what lies behind its morality and its filmmakers&apos; cores all in the trailer. It&apos;s one of the most unsubtle films I&apos;ve seen in years.\n\nLet me give you an idea of how patriotic this film is; in the one minute and fifty-one second trailer I counted fifteen shots where the American flag was clearly visible, thirteen of them in the first minute. There&apos;s also an unintentionally corny sequence of Marshall R. Teague&apos;s character riding a motorcycle, draped in leather apparel, and proudly letting the American flag flow in the wind of the air. There&apos;s nothing particularly wrong with that, but as a whole, this is another tired, worn entry in the almost hopeless genre of American cinema, and when I say &quot;American cinema,&quot; I mean cinema that comes from this country boasting nationalism and simple, earnest, life-affirming values. See Broken Bridges and Seven Days in Utopia for schooling in the field.\n\nWe begin on an offbeat note that could&apos;ve been keenly directed into passable territory with development and humanity. The first character we see is Thomas Revere, a man who has a patriotic father named Bob (Marshall R. Teague), a loving mother (Jennifer O&apos;Neill), a young wife (Nikki Novak), and a young son on the way. He enlists in the war to fight for his country, like his father did, and writes letters and sends videos back to his wife and infant son during his deployment. Later on, in the middle of a normal day, Thomas&apos;s mom is greeted by the sight of two military men, in uniform, with an American flag and a wreath on her doorstep. Thomas&apos;s wife is now a widower with a young child. If this happened twenty minutes into the picture, and we had more development and interest in the character of Thomas, having him die would be a monumentally depressing plot-point. To have him die minutes after meeting him leaves the viewer emotionally deprived when it should leave us emotionally drained.\n\nWe move several years later, where Thomas&apos;s son Christian (whether the name is supposed to be coincidental or unintentional I can&apos;t say), played by Hunter Gomez, is a bright and curious fourteen year old boy, who is suddenly interested in all that has happened to his father, as if a fatherless kid never asked his mother just what happened to daddy. He digs through an old chest of his grandfather&apos;s to try and find more facts about him, and gets his family to watch old videos of Thomas&apos;s love letters to his mother.\n\nThen we take the incredibly abrupt topic of how Christmas has become a greatly limited holiday in the states, what with political correctness and the recognition of other holidays around the same time. Bob, who is the mayor of the small town of Mount Columbus, is sickened at how America has neglected the fact that Christmas is a national holiday, and while it isn&apos;t celebrated by every American in the country, it should nonetheless be recognized and we should have the broad freedom to wish people a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; without being scolded for arrogance.\n\nI&apos;ve noticed a barrage of online reviewers claiming those who will hate this movie are liberals and that&apos;s because they are not true Americans. I&apos;m not so sure about that. I consider myself a hardcore Libertarian, who has an immense amount of pride and respect for the United States, possesses a large amount of individualist opinions, and shares the same views as Bob on the idea of Christmas; we live in America, and saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; on Television or in public schools shouldn&apos;t be the big deal that it is. I&apos;m living proof you can share the same opinion as the filmmakers and not be a fan of the film.\n\nThe main reason is for the heavy-handedness of the topic at hand, and the complete bleeding heart, Christian-Conservative propaganda that becomes nauseatingly obvious and brutally contrived throughout the whole film. This is a picture that completely shortchanges character relations and depth in order to promote its ideology. It features capable acting by Marshall R. Teague and Hunter Gomez, but uninspired, wooden performances from the majority of its actor, and screenwriter that ultimately could pass for a heavily biased lecture.\n\nI suppose my main quibble with the film is that it makes an issue out of something that is so petty and foolish in real life that seeing a film pound in the morals and someone&apos;s biased ideology of the event makes it just as painful to listen to. I respect the filmmakers involved, I wouldn&apos;t object to watching other films by them, and I feel that with great material, they could all work wonders. But to make a ninety-eight minute film that does nothing more than paint an oppressive picture of an opinion held by the people involved, and utilize it as an attack for anyone on the opposite side of the coin is a colossal miscalculation in terms of a way going about an argument and in terms of filmmaking.\n\nStarring: Marshall R. Teague, Jennifer O&apos;Neill, Fred Williamson, Nikki Novak, Hunter Gomez, and Jenna Boyd. Directed by: Darrel Campbell and Kevin McAfee.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps best known for Ronald Colman&apos;s signature performance as Sidney Carton, this excellent adaptation of Dickens&apos;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; also has a lot of other strengths to offer. Colman is joined by the likes of Edna May Oliver and Basil Rathbone in a fine cast that brings the characters to life. The story itself is filled with good scenes, ranging from the exciting Bastille scene to courtroom showdowns to important confrontations between the characters.\n\nThe novel contains a lot more material than would ever fit into a normal-length movie, and the screenplay does a good job of selecting sequences that fit together and that work well on the screen. While differing in places from the original, it preserves the most important themes and ideas. The French Revolution is an interesting and multi-layered subject, and a good number of high-quality classic films are set in the period. The Dickens novel, in particular, lends itself readily to a cinema adaptation.\n\nThe role of Sidney Carton is almost an actor&apos;s dream, an unlikely hero who has to battle his own limitations as well as the situation around him. Colman&apos;s classic style does full justice to the role, making the character fully sympathetic without pretending that he is something he is not, and without drawing attention away from the overall themes and focus of the story. Most present-day actors would be far too self-absorbed to play the role as it should be played.\n\nAlmost everything in this version is satisfying and enjoyable. It combines plenty of drama with some good lighter moments and period detail, almost all of it done with skill. Colman himself clinches it with his memorable portrayal of a challenging and interesting character."

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: The Message",
      "reviewBody": "For those anticipating Lu Chuan&apos;s epic Nanking movie City of Life and Death which will premiere this week, you might also want to check out The Message, now playing in cinemas and also set during the turbulent days of the Sino-Japanese war in China in the early 40s. While Lu Chuan&apos;s film tried to portray history through an objective lens, lending to it a documentary-like feel, The Message showed how Chinese cinema has grown to tap upon those dark days to create what would be an extremely well made tale of espionage, with insurgent and spies working effortlessly to bring misery to their Japanese occupiers.\n\nBased upon the novel by Jia Mai, which Chen Kuo-fu has adapted the screenplay and shared directorial responsibilities with Gan Qunshu, The Message is a top notch tale of bluff versus bluff and dwindling trust, where a group of Counter-Insurgency Chinese troopers got called into a mansion for close interrogation, because one of them, codenamed The Phantom, is supposedly working for the resistance. It&apos;s curious times because you have the puppet Chinese government and their troops, the Japanese officers seeking to weed out traitors, and the resistance who have so far struck plenty of fear amongst the Japanese ranks because of their Basterds-like brutality, which the opening few minutes would let you have a taste of.\n\nIn essence it&apos;s a process of elimination, and while it is engaging on many levels - the story, the &quot;whodunnit&quot;, the opulent and richly designed sets and costumes, swooping camera-work that will leave you breathless and that pulsating musical score, it somehow felt a little dragged out in its mid-section as it lingered on playing everything out in relative sequential order, and looked as if it&apos;s headed for a very straight-forward espionage tale in smoking out the spy amongst their midst, with some ingenuity of scheming, counter-scheming and baiting involved of course.\n\nIt&apos;s also because we tend to equate the biggest stars here, Zhou Xun and Li Bing Bing, as probably the most highly suspicious, and as the story continue to develop along that line, which is why the film had this unfair sense of familiarity going against it, which doesn&apos;t do justice to the film. What more, the inter-titles that frequently appear, continue to provide one clue too many as to whether the Japanese have got their man, or not. And that&apos;s probably the reason why some films work a lot better when it&apos;s a bunch of competent unknowns so that star power (naturally to attract an audience) doesn&apos;t factor in manipulating you. \n\nHowever, it is the finale arc that elevated this film with its satisfying conclusion of the dangerous environment that resistance fighters often put themselves into. History has its fair share of tales on bravery and heroism, and I&apos;m game to see a lot more of such war/espionage films coming out of the Chinese mainland, especially those with a solid story backed by excellent production values such as this one. If through films one can exorcise demons of the past, often through some form of escapism and fantasy, then perhaps the time has come for Chinese cinema to do just that, and to wow audiences around the world as well with universal themes.\n\nThe Message clearly is that it&apos;s highly recommended, and Hollywood better watch out!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Camicia Nera&quot; or &quot;Black Shirt&quot; is a staged propaganda documentary/drama tracing the rise of Fascism in Italy and and made to celebrate its tenth year.  Made from the Fascist point of view, it  is an attempt to praise all the purported achievements of that regime from 1922 to the year 1932.\n\n  It starts with Italy as it had been in the year 1914, as World War I was about to explode.  The focus is on a family living in substandard dwellings in the malarial region of the Pontine Marshes, south of Rome.  The main character is a blacksmith who must go off to war.  His family and his little son will miss him and await his return.   But he is injured and suffers from amnesia at the end of the war, hospitalized in Germany.  \n\n The return of the veterans is shown against a background of social turmoil, with the enemies of society being the socialists and their general strikes.  Enter Benito Mussolini and his &quot;fasci di combattimento&quot; militias (thugs, actually) who strike at the Socialists and  who, in their view, will bring about the salvation of Italy from chaosthe Fascist State! \n\n That  state  will oversee the society like a loving father from birth to death. The youth are enrolled in regimented &quot;Balilla&quot; groups.  The Concordat is signed with Pope Pius XI, making the Vatican an independent state, a program of public works is instituted, the Pontine mashes of our blacksmith hero (who finally returns to his family) are drained and the water shunted into canals.  \n\nNew housing goes up to replace the hovels the peasants had lived in. Emigrants who had left the country during hard times now are seen as returning joyously to rebuild the nation.  The Fascist anthem of Italy, &quot;Giovinezza&quot;  - &quot;Youth,&quot; is sung everywhere.  Fascist Italy has reached its tenth year. \n\nFor what the film is, a self-laudatory propaganda piece, the film manages to maintain a good deal of interest.  Many of the scenes shot for the film are well photographed, particularly those of the agricultural areas, although he sound isn&apos;t up to snuff for that period.  \n\nDictator Benito Mussolini&apos;s speech near the end, filled with his typical arrogant bluster, is interesting to watch.  This is a period in which he was widely revered by the Italian nation, and many foreigners as well. The U.S. ambassador to Italy, Richard Washburn Child, even wrote an introduction to Mussolini&apos;s autobiography, that praised him to the sky!  With hindsight, of course, we can look at him and wonder what he would have thought if he had been able to see himself about thirteen years hence when he would be nabbed by partisans as he was attempting to flee Italy in German uniform, then shot and strung up from a gas station beam in Milan and vilified by the crowds.\n\n Another film of the period praising the Fascists was Alessandro Blasetti&apos;s 1934 &quot;Vecchia Guardia&quot; which was more of a dramatic piece than this earlier work made by Giovacchino Forzano."

I saw the uncut version,readily available at the Cleveland Public Library. It was indeed sexually graphic,reaching a point where the act seems to be driven by a kind of symbiosis that can only culminate in one way. The ending is one of the most horrifying things I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie. Do not confuse\n\nthis movie with the vastly inferior IN THE REALM OF PASSION."

      "reviewBody": "This film is proof that not every movie needs to have academy award winning performances, a gripping plot and special effects to be enjoyable. Mannequin is certainly not a spectacular piece of cinematic achievement, but its simplicity and light-heartedness is what makes it great! I&apos;ve loved this movie ever since I was a kid and I always, and still do, find it a fun and enjoyable watch, especially on a lazy Saturday afternoon.\n\nJonathan Switcher is a down-on-his-luck artist. He can&apos;t hold down a regular job because his creativity keeps on sabotaging his productivity. One day he saves a little old lady who gratefully offers him employment at the department store that she owns. Jonathan goes to work arranging the store&apos;s window displays, and happens across a mannequin that he built during one of his short lived careers. Low and behold, the mannequin he created comes to life when the two of them are alone and a fun and silly romantic comedy ensues. \n\nThe entire plot is quite silly and full of holes, but the movie is pure fun. Andrew McCarthy is cute and endearing as always and Kim Cattrall is fun and witty as the bubbly mannequin. This film is rife with great one-liners and hysterical situations and of course a great 80&apos;s style musical montage. Actual one of the most unfortunate things about this film is that the music is great and a soundtrack album was never released! For shame!\n\nOf course Mannequin isn&apos;t thought-provoking, nor is it clever or cinematic ally impressive. It&apos;s just a cute silly little film that will make you laugh as long as you don&apos;t take it too seriously."

She was also a distinguished painter and--had she been a man--her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens.\n\nIn addition, by the time she died in 1943, Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British Conservation Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her, remains as it was in Beatrix Potter&apos;s day for others to enjoy, is her bequest to the nation.\n\nThis is her story....

This movie is good, creepy, and Val does a very good job at being creepy as hell. I gave this movie a 7 stars review, because of general good acting, creepy atmosphere, gory death scene,and I had no high expectation for that movie, so it was a pleasant surprise. I do recommend people to watch this movie, don&apos;t be turned down by all the 1 star reviews. \n\nps: Watch it in pitch black with your girlfriend,and after the movie, whistle like Val, you&apos;re girlfriend is going to love you :)",

      "reviewBody": "A huge still from this film on a book of my father&apos;s on Epic movies had long intrigued me but when I had tried to watch it one afternoon several years ago (almost to the day) on Italian TV, I was put off by its utter daftness. Now that I&apos;m on a mini-marathon of filmed epics in time for Good Friday, I thought I&apos;d give this celebrated Italian wartime spectacle another look.\n\nAnd what a look it turned out to be: this must certainly belong among the most sumptuous and ornately mounted fantasies ever put on film and, in hindsight, it&apos;s interesting that each major country involved in the ongoing struggle up to that time invested in a splendidly escapist (but not apolitical) extravaganza - the others being, of course, England&apos;s THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1940) and Germany&apos;s MUNCHHAUSEN (1943), which I had rewatched last year.\n\nAnyway, the plot is a convoluted mix of The Nibelungen (its Teutonic visuals), William Tell (the protagonists&apos; prowess with weapons), Macbeth (the doom-laden prophecies of a soothsayer in the forest) and even Tarzan (the son of a slain king, abandoned in the woods as a child, is eventually raised by lions and reappears after many years donning a loincloth!) but, thankfully, it moves at such a lightning pace that what one remembers most is not the court machinations but the splendid pageantry and impressively-staged action and crowd scenes, never more so than during the remarkable, extended jousting sequence.\n\nThe performers are also notable: Massimo Girotti as the afore-mentioned &quot;Tarzan&quot; figure (who is also prone to giant leaps a&apos; la The Incredible Hulk!), Elisa Cegani (as a princess imprisoned in her own castle by her despotic father), Osvaldo Valenti (as a seemingly unbeatable knight at the joust whose winner will take the princess for his wife), Rina Morelli as the omnipresent soothsayer, famed wrestler Primo Carnera as a long-suffering he-man and, most of all, the larger-than-life villainy of Gino Cervi (as the illegitimate ruler, having killed his own brother to claim the throne, and calls everyone around him &quot;beast&quot;!) and Luisa Ferida (as Tundra, a sort of blood-thirsty Jungle Girl who is eventually reformed by her love for Girotti); it&apos;s worth noting here that the three leads each have dual roles playing the parent of the character they portray later on in the film.\n\nSurprisingly enough for such a commercial (if undoubtedly artistically valid) venture, the film emerged the winner of the Venice Film Festival where, ironically, it was greeted with contempt by the guest of honor, the Nazi Propaganda Minister Dr. Josef Goebbels! Incidentally, another person who was unimpressed with the film was director Riccardo Freda - who should know a thing or two about fantasy film-making, being the helmer of several &quot;sword-and-sandal&quot; epics in his time.\n\nDirector Blasetti would go on to make another celebrated milestone of Italian cinema, the even more elaborate FABIOLA (1949) and, unfortunately, given their considerable reputation, both of these marvelous films are as yet unavailable on DVD even in Italy - although, the same can be said of several other little-seen but equally outstanding Italian epics including LA NAVE DELLE DONNE MALEDETTE (1953) and VIVA L&apos;ITALIA! (1961)...",

Melody Anderson as Dale isn&apos;t exactly ugly either, and also gets to wear some very revealing get-ups.\n\nHell, even Blue Peter fans are catered for, with &apos;80s presenter Peter Duncan appearing as a tree dweller whose hand is attacked by a slimy vacuum cleaner bag with a poisonous sting in its tail. Now that&apos;s what I call entertainment!",

      "reviewBody": "Unwittingly it is my very first film from the universally acclaimed South Korean auteur Sang-soo Hong, by virtue of Isabelle Huppert. But out of my heart, the film is frustratingly bland and ineptly flippant. \n\nAll the setting is exclusively in a remote beach and a family hotel near sea side. After an informal conversation between a pair of mother and daughter, Park Soo (Yoon) and Wonju (Jeong), about their familial dispute. Then Wonju starts to write three short stories for her script, each centers a French woman named Anne (Huppert), respectively as a female director, an adulteress and a divorcée (conveniently dressed in blue, red and green), and Wonju becomes the hotelier. \n\nIn each scenario, Anne is pursued by Korean men, for the blue Anne, her friend Jongsoo (Hyo) expresses his beyond-friend affection to her despite he is with his pregnant wife Kumhee (Moon); for the red Anne, she is on a tryst with the film director Munsoo (Mun), who is late for their rendezvous, subsequently she has illusions of whether or not Munsoo will ever arrive; for the green Anne, who is accompanied by her friend Park Soo, out of her wedlock because her husband deserts her for a Korean woman, she is seeking help from a monk (Youngoak) but also seduced by the lecherous Jongsoo. \n\nYet in each episode, Anne encounters an amiable lifeguard (Yu), and looks for a small lighthouse, they almost have the same dialog typically instigated between a foreign tourist and a local citizen, which is pleasant to watch for the first time, but a third time is not a charm. In one hand, one can greatly appreciate the sharp-witted execution of the in-your-face hostility hidden beneath the ostensible amicability thanks to the language barrier, on the other hand, most of the time, the film entraps itself into its own dilemma-tic loop, only skirts along the surface of the inter-cultural clash. \n\nHuppert is criminally underused here, maybe she also took the advantage for a holiday here, the Korean cast is naturalistic at its best, Sang-soo Hong never give anything too demanding to perform, the film is a free-wheeling prose, it might fare better if it is projected as a screen background with its unobtrusive visual tenderness and lilted but minimal conversations while you can sip your afternoon tea with mini-cookies, but, it you want to carefully scrutinize its contents and its subtext with your full attention, it is an embarrassingly dreary one, and it seems Sang-soo Hong himself, did adopt a devil-may-care attitude long since its inception.",

We have tons of movies talking about greed, envy, family, success and love, but there are still very few examples for religious or sexual themes - and even less which combine these two. There is a reason for that. Sexuality is considered as dirty, Religion is considered as very private. It takes some wit to ignore both, and go deep down the rabbit hole to find some answers.\n\n&quot;The passion of life&quot; is an independent production which tries to shed a sophisticated light at this topic. And unlike many other, they manage to do so without using sexuality as an eye catcher, but as the very key to the main theme.\n\nIndeed this movie is NOT about BDSM, it is no blockbuster, and it is not trying to be. It is a movie with a strong connection to theatre and to philosophy. If you look for a kinky SM flick, look somewhere else. If you ever wondered if there is a deeper reason for sex than just breeding, look here.\n\nFor me, the most interesting part of this movie were the deep and intense discussions about lust and sin, which were far from being the typical black/white stereotype. And all the actors were quite charming in their struggle to fill their life with some sense - like we all are trying to do. Especially Marina Anna Eich as &quot;Eva&quot; convinced me as young, pretty successful woman, who is experiencing her new life with an amazement like Alice in Wonderland.\n\nDon&apos;t expect an easy movie here. But in my opinion there is little chance that you ever will get such a deep look at sexuality in a cinema again any time soon.",

His &quot;asides&quot; lines to us, the audience, almost had me in tears laughing. The man was unflappable, with a funny remark after each disaster. \n\nThis is the best &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; story I ever saw.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an impactful movie that I consider to be a cornerstone of modern Turkish cinema. It&apos;s title Pardon (Apologies) might as well be directed at the faceless millions who suffer(ed) under fascistic regimes whose human rights abuses will continue to be ignored for political and financial convenience.\n\nOn it&apos;s surface, Pardon is the story of three hapless mates but it&apos;s also the story of a continuous dark period in a quasi-democratic republic, marred with injustice brought on by self-appointed forces tirelessly working to protect the state from its citizens. As the story unfolds, we quickly discover that such protections are nowhere to be found when it&apos;s required to protect the citizens from the state, especially during intervals of uninterrupted accelerated authoritarianism.\n\nThis is such a bitter pill to swallow that it takes a master like Ferhan Sensoy to wrap it&apos;s bitter core up in his humorous candy, enabling us to digest the tragedy through comedy. Ancient Greek playwrights would be proud of his craftsmanship.\n\nIt&apos;s also a story of human perseverence and companionship which constantly forces its audience to invoke their sense of justice as our unwilling participants are dragged through the sham courts, having their spirits crushed blow after blow, bit by bit until they finally give up and accept their fate. The audience can&apos;t help but internalize the depressing feeling of the life being sucked out of these once spirited characters.\n\nIbrahim, our main protagonist serves as the primary means of conveying the collective humanity of the trio. Through a series of flashbacks We&apos;re given a background story covering his desires, hopes and plans for the future. While we&apos;re presented with many of his flaws, we also come to understand that he&apos;s fundamentally a well meaning person who is at times let down by his own detachment from reality.\n\nHis family, especially his father is typical working class with a strictly working class relationship with money and wealth which is also at the core of Ibrahim&apos;s problems since he can&apos;t seem to find the money to set up a small business of his own, which retards his growth as a person: He can&apos;t get married, he can&apos;t have a family and settle down so he chases unlikely sources of income such as gambling. It&apos;s thus additionally tragic that he has to be forced to grow up in prison, under such dire circumstances while life passes him by, leading to a downward spiral of despair.\n\nMuzaffer and Aydin are seemingly two opposite characters who compliment Ibrahim&apos;s personality. Muzaffer is a cynical, somewhat selfish person but he&apos;s not devoid of empathy and he always seem to have a soft spot for his friends so while it might take some encouraging, he eventually comes through and does the right thing. Aydin is a naive, optimistic romantic who tries to see the silver lining in everything thus as a reward, the universe in its infinite wisdom punishes him the hardest. He&apos;s only involved in this clusterfrack because the police need a third suspect and his name is the one Ibrahim comes up with, he is tortured and convicted for simply having made a good impression.\n\nHe also serves as a reminder that if we ever feel inclined to distance ourselves from Ibrahim, as peculiar a character as he is, and mistakenly assume this only happens to people like him who don&apos;t have a high regard for authority, we should realize that there is no difference when the blind eye of the justice points at random people to hold accountable for a crime they didn&apos;t commit. If you&apos;re at the wrong place at the wrong time, it really doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re the right or the wrong person.\n\nUltimately, this is an amazing movie not just because of the quality of the writing, the acting and the addictively quotable dialogue, it&apos;s a movie which, through humor, helps society face the abuses of the so-called justice system and perhaps serve to comfort many open wounds of those who were scarred by it.",

Conversational acting is better then the actual action, I think I would scream more if I was being nail gunned to the wall. If it wasn&apos;t for the amount of fake blood I think this could have easily been given a PG rating. Fair storyline but unlikely you will watch again. Some very funny parts. This film could have had the makings of a great horror but the plot was poor and only one good death scene. It isn&apos;t bad but it isn&apos;t good either.

      "name": "Life and Love, As Interpreted by Paul Verhoeven",
      "reviewBody": "There are many ways in which love and passion can be manifested in a relationship, but if it is to prevail, it is essential that both sides complement one another, physically, emotionally and psychologically; the feelings borne on the wings of romance must above all else be mutual and deeply instilled on both sides.  When they are not, the end result must necessarily be estrangement; it is a law-- not of man, but of nature.  In `Turkish Delight,&apos; director Paul Verhoeven dissects a relationship born of passion, examines the ramifications of the attitudes and actions of the individuals involved-- as well as the couple they become-- and offers the results to his audience for consideration.  Is it, though, a story of love and passion?  Yes.  But it comes via a route more analogous to the sensibilities of David Cronenberg than Ang Lee; it is decidedly more Craven than Capra.  So don&apos;t come to this film expecting tender moments; instead, prepare yourself for an offering that is provocative, that is sexually explicit, and finally, graphic in it&apos;s more violent moments.  This is a film for neither the fainthearted nor the modest, but for the discerning viewer only.\n\nIn the first few minutes of this film, we are introduced to Eric Vonk (Rutger Hauer), an artist with a passion for his work, but even more so for experiences that lean more toward the wanton and carnal in aspect.  We instantly become voyeurs as he proceeds to overindulge in a series of lusty encounters, an extreme display of irresponsible debauchery that cannot but impel a most unpropitious and subjective first impression on behalf of the viewer, who is forced to bear witness to a man of obvious and insatiable appetites and a tentative moral code.  Or so it would seem, initially.\n\nAs the story unfolds, however, we begin to understand Eric and what it is that compels him thus; and it begins with a photograph of a beautiful young woman named Olga (Monique van de Ven), the woman with whom Eric once shared his life, love, passion and, yes, his lust.  It is obvious from the outset that she is no longer with him, which evokes the question that has to be asked:  `Why?&apos;  And from that inauspicious beginning, a picture emerges that may not be pretty, and is, in fact, fairly disconcerting.  By the end of the film, though, all questions pertaining to Eric Vonk and the mysterious Olga have been answered.  The screen grows dark then; but the images to which the viewer has just been made privy are ones that are going to remain in the mind&apos;s eye for some time afterwards.\n\nWorking from a screenplay by Gerard Soeteman (adapted from the novel by Jan Wolkers), Verhoeven establishes himself as the antithesis of Nora Ephron, presenting his `love&apos; story in terms that are decidedly raw and primitive. Though he does manage to establish the fact that Eric does have deep love for Olga, it is lust that seemingly dominates the picture, and though there is a dramatic twist to the story, it all comes across more like a twisted fairy tale than anything else.  Verhoeven uses violence to express the same sentiments Ephron, for example, does through compassion and empathy.  But that is his style.  It&apos;s his prerogative; it&apos;s his turf; it&apos;s his film.  And Verhoeven as much as says to his audience that if you don&apos;t like it, you can leave.  It&apos;s not as if he doesn&apos;t have respect for his viewer, though; rather, it seems as if it&apos;s something he simply has not considered. \n\n If you can get past the baggage with which Verhoeven inexplicably saddles his own film, there is an interesting, if not riveting, story to be found. But, like Cronenberg&apos;s affinity for slime and things that ooze, Verhoeven apparently cannot escape his affinity for violence, even when it works to his detriment.  In the case of this film, it results in certain scenes that are too avant-garde to be effective within the context of the overall film. These are scenes in which Eric is hallucinating or day dreaming about particular aspects of his relationship with Olga.  They are abrupt insertions into the narrative that simply do not mesh with the flow of the film.  The seam left by the weave, as it were, is just too apparent.  Beyond the shock value (which is minimum), it just doesn&apos;t work.\n\nOn the positive side, Verhoeven does extract worthy performances from his stars, Hauer and van de Ven.  Hauer, in his feature film debut (and at this point some eight years away from his American film debut in `Nighthawks&apos;) displays a natural ability in front of the camera and seems comfortably uninhibited, which enables him to use his rugged good looks to the best advantage.  Eric is a complex character of single minded intent, which Hauer conveys quite ably in his performance.  Van de Ven also makes her motion picture debut here, and beyond her obvious beauty there is a definite indication of the talent that would soon bring her international acclaim (though her star has yet to rise above the American landscape).  Her portrayal of Olga is convincing, and her myriad charms are neither misplaced nor misused by Verhoeven here.  And commendably, she manages to transcend the mere use of her physical attributes and create a memorable character with a truly affecting performance. \n\nThe supporting cast includes Tonny Huurdeman (Moeder), Wim van den Brink (Vader) and Dolf de Vries (Paul).  This film is definitely not for everyone; it fails as entertainment, but succeeds as an examination of the extremes to which we, as humans, are susceptible.  `Turkish Delight,&apos; then, will be received in any number of different ways.  Some will be shocked and appalled by what they see on the screen; others will be offended.  And still others will understand that what is depicted here is a very real reflection of things that go on in a very real world, as interpreted by Paul Verhoeven. 7/10.",
