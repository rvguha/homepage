In all, it&apos;s interesting because Bukowski was such a good writer and you&apos;ll be pulled in.\n\nI read all of Bukowski&apos;s work and loved the stuff, especially Post Office: A Novel by Charles Bukowski, Factotum by Charles Bukowski and Pulp by Charles Bukowski.\n\nIf you don&apos;t like Bukowski then you&apos;ll probably be bored out of your mind. Some people have trouble because he drank so much and lived in some shoddy place in L. A. Bukowski was also an admitted dipsomaniac and barfly. At least the guy was honest. I like a writer who is honest. You really do find honesty in Bukowski&apos;s work.\n\nBukowski is drunk, reads poetry, talks about life amongst other things.\n\nYou&apos;ll be pulled in.",

Because of a promotion, Daniel is back in her life again - but out just as quickly.\n\nTo top it off, she winds up in a Thai prison, and while there, she teaches fellow prisoners the right moves to &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot;\n\nFinding enough of a plot to for a feature-length script was obviously tough, so tough, in fact, that large parts of it become music videos. Everyone is very good, but one can&apos;t help asking why someone like Mark puts up with Bridget. They&apos;re not a realistic couple. At all.\n\nI&apos;d have been furious if I&apos;d paid to see this in a theater; in fact, I would have been unhappy if I had rented it. I saw it for free on TV and on that basis, it&apos;s okay and fun to see the actors and listen to the songs. Alas, it&apos;s the only way to see it without feeling you&apos;ve been had.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, it is worth nothing that director Ken Shapiro seemingly hasn&apos;t been employed since this near-catastrophe was released in 1981. It&apos;s pretty safe to say that&apos;s a bad sign. Secondly, even a stellar cast cannot make a movie very good (what I like to call &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; syndrome). Now that I have gotten that out of the way, a quick synopsis : Chevy Chase (that in itself is a bad sign) stars as an air traffic controller who, after an encounter with nuclear waste, acquires telekinetic powers, which he uses against his romantic rivals. The premise in itself is engaging and open to the possibility of great comedy. So what happened?\n\nWell, Ken Shapiro could be blamed. The direction is sloppy; actually it is downright pathetic. The pacing is WAY too slow, the action is ineptly handled, and many of the actors seem bored. And worst of all, the special effects are woeful...I haven&apos;t seen so much camera equipment on-screen since the glory days of Ed Wood. Case in point...the scene with the Flying-Airplane-Ashtray (don&apos;t ask), where some strange, large object is obviously present in the close-ups, holding up the Ashtray next to the camera. I&apos;ve made home movies with better effects.\n\nWhat about the actors? Well, Nell Carter is an absolute hoot; she deserves better. And Dabney Coleman is entirely in his element here as a shady, egotistical author. Brian Doyle Murray and Mary Kay Place are also entertaining. Patti D&apos;Arbanville is a bit lacking in comedic talent; she is given nothing more to do than pout and screech. But the real problem here is Chase. He is just going through the motions here, playing the hapless bumbler bit to death and looking very bored doing it. There is no life to his performance, and it grinds the movie to a halt.\n\nTrue, there are some funny moments here...Nell Carter gets most of the laughs in a woefully small role, the scenes involving Chase&apos;s romantic rival Barry (Mitch Kreindel) are pretty amusing, and one reviewer here has already mentioned Chase&apos;s throwaway line &quot;Smells like feet,&quot; which for some reason made me laugh hysterically...but the funny moments are few and far between. There is so much BAD to sort through to get to the GOOD stuff, and it just isn&apos;t worth the time and trouble. Perhaps in better hands, &quot;Modern Problems&quot; could have been a good movie. This certainly isn&apos;t it."

      "reviewBody": "Why John Farrow decided there had to be a remake of FIVE CAME BACK (which he directed earlier) remains a mystery to me. The script here is pretty much the same thing--standard plane crash with survivors lost in the jungle--and all on a studio set that looks like no more than a studio set. So much for reality.\n\nBut the performances he draws from his cast are almost enough to make the film as engrossing as it strives to be. The passengers are a mixed lot--among them a beauteous Anita Ekberg who poses prettily but makes no real effort to act. On the other hand, Robert Ryan and Keith Andes, as co-pilots, Beulah Bondi and Cameron Prud&apos;Homme as an elderly couple, Phyllis Kirk and Gene Barry as a mismatched young couple, and Jon Provost (before his Lassie fame) do excellent jobs considering the fact that their roles are stereotypes. There are also less fortunate roles played by Adele Mara, Jesse White and Fred Clark. Mara&apos;s sudden exit from the plane at the height of the storm at least spares her the difficulty of facing the rest of the film as a stranded stewardess.\n\nTop-lined in the cast is Rod Steiger as a criminal facing execution once he is returned to authorities. In an ironic twist of fate, he&apos;s the one who eventually chooses who shall leave the jungle crash scene and who shall not.\n\nInteresting, but no real improvement over the original except for a few of the performances. All in all, good B-picture entertainment.\n\n The most convincing moments are the plane&apos;s anxious moments during a wild thunderstorm. This is by and far the most visually compelling part of the film in which Farrow&apos;s direction (and some good special effects) shows his capabilities."

It started well enough and seemed to be building to something profound. Instead, from a point it just drifts, and ends up going nowhere. At times it seems judgmental, then next moment titillating. Instead of objectivity the writer and director try to hedge their bets.\n\nOn the plus side, Ashley Hinshaw is great in the lead role. Stunningly beautiful, and convincing. James Franco proves yet again that he is vastly overrated as an actor, coming across as a clueless kid in a school play. He is may well be the male version of Kristen Stewart...\n\nHeather Graham does well in a supporting role. Dev Patel seems a bit miscast in his role.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Was anxious to see a big-budget Korean take on WWII, and overall came away impressed ... despite the shortcomings and annoyances. My history with Korean films have been limited to small, intimate stories told with quiet manner, and frenetic action flicks with sub-standard stunt work. Director and co-writer Je-kyu Kang attempts to combine an intimate story of two young men with an epic war film with a record body count and excruciatingly frequent number of cuts/edits.\n\nThe movie starts off by showing us how the lives of two boys first intersect. Jun-shik Kim (by Dong-gun Jong) is a farmer&apos;s son whose dad works on the estate of Tatsuo Hasegawa&apos;s (Jo Odagiri) grandfather. A wide class difference separates the boys, but their love of running generates a severe feud ... a rivalry that won&apos;t die easily. All of this takes place in Japan-occupied Korea, and it&apos;s clear early on that the filmmaker sets out to defend all Korean actions.\n\nInspired by a real life 1944 photo that shows a Korean soldier being captured while wearing a Nazi uniform, the back-story here is as strange and complex as any you have seen ... unfortunately, it is handled with the manipulative touch of a sledge hammer. As their marathon-running rivalry reaches a crescendo, both boys are drawn into the Japanese Army, albeit via substantially different routes. Tatsuo is an officer, while Jun-shik is an enslaved line soldier. Their bitter rivalry does not stop for a little thing like WWII and it leads to many moments of near insanity.\n\nWhat really is impressive about the film is the three main battle scenes, especially the storming of Normandy Beach. If you have seen Saving Private Ryan, then you know the model ... however, this one takes it even further. It is intense, loud and brutal. The question of whether the rivalry can survive capture by Russians and then Nazi&apos;s, or whether survival instincts take over is really the heart of the story.\n\nAs terrific as the battle scenes are, it is impossible not to mention the hyper-editing that lasts most of the film&apos;s 142 minutes. It is hard on the senses and makes the action difficult to follow ... which is a shame for a film that offers so much realism in war scenes. Still, it&apos;s not an easy film to watch and we care enough about the two characters to put up with the eyeball attack we get in most scenes.",

      "reviewBody": "After the flawed but fascinating &apos;Parallax View&apos;, Alan J. Pakula learns from his mistakes, and delivers a more logical and satisfying story in &apos;All the Presidents Men&apos;. Everything about this movie is of the highest quality. Another bravado turn from cinematographer Gordon Willis creates a world of intensely glaring lights and ominously inky shadows. Subtle and realistic performances from the entire cast create a believable pressroom atmosphere of rivalry, idealism and integrity.\n\nThe story has been the prototype for every conspiracy thriller since, establishing all the motifs that would eventually be exhausted by &apos;The X-Files&apos; and become cliché. The narrative flows smoothly, and Goldman does an excellent job of reigning in a potentially incomprehensible plot line, a feat that won him a much-deserved Oscar. The story does, however, slow down in spots, becoming repetitious, and could have benefited from a little judicious pruning.\n\nAn excellent movie, that not only sheds light on a historic episode without the usual glossy spin, but highlights the pitiful condition of modern journalism, a fall from grace that in time will prove to far more terrifying and long reaching than anything perpetrated by Nixon and his cronies.",

The stable is being rented by a dotty artist who specializes in religious paintings, and the sisters have been drawn there by a picture-postcard with the hopes of spearheading development in that area for a children&apos;s hospital. Skillful sentiment walks a nimble line between heartfelt religiosity and treacle. The nuns (Loretta Young and Celeste Holm, both Oscar-nominated) lack just two things in their quest--land and money--and the ways in which they acquire these necessities will warm even the grumpiest of viewers (they melt the heart of Thomas Gomez&apos;s surly racketeer--luckily for the sisters, he&apos;s a Catholic!). No weighty or ponderous agendas here, just simple, old-fashioned entertainment. Beautifully photographed by Oscar-nominated Joseph LaShelle, with music direction by Lionel Newman that tugs at the tear ducts. *** from ****",

      "name": "Vivid but dIfficult masterwork by Torre-Nilsson",
      "reviewBody": "Made during the peak period of his career, THE EAVESDROPPER is a politically charged melodrama by Leopoldo Torre-Nilsson. A very big deal at the time (local film awards and showings at New York Film Festival and other such events), it&apos;s been forgotten and might seem quite dated to first-time, latter-day viewers.\n\nMade as a U.S. coproduction with producer Paul Heller, the film stars Janet Margolin, who Heller had introduced so successfully in &quot;David and Lisa&quot;, paired with Stathis Giallelis, also an extremely hot property circa 1964 (when EAVESDROPPER was made) who had shared a Golden Globe award for Elia Kazan&apos;s &quot;America, America&quot; with no less than Albert Finney and Robert Walker Jr. in the &quot;most promising actor&quot; category.\n\nGiallelis, whose brooding, intense mien is on view throughout the movie, is cast as young Argentine neo-Fascist Martin, seen early on with his chums defacing various monuments and public buildings as a sort of right-wing opposition movement. A telling early scene has his thuggish pals terrorizing a car full of innocent folk who are driving too slowly in front of them on the highway. Martin meekly joins in the tormenting my letting air out of the front tire, but feels deeply shamed when he discovers the driver is a helpless, handicapped guy in braces.\n\nMartin checks in at the Hotel Venus on a prominent avenue, with mysterious plans. We later find out that a major fascist leader will be feted with a parade on this route, a key to the plot line.\n\nA friend of a girl he knows is impressed with Martin and moves into the hotel with him -she&apos;s Ines, played by Margolin who is truly lovely and glamorous this time out (and convincing in her post-synched Spanish dialog). The duo&apos;s torrid sex scenes are tastefully staged, not as explicit as Torre-Nilsson&apos;s memorable Isabel Sarli vehicle of a couple years before 70 TIMES 7, but still effective.\n\nA troupe of actors and musicians from Spain is staying on the same floor of the hotel and performing in a large ballroom/theater there. While Ines tries to befriend them, including a cute child (who has an animal toy bearing a human skull as its scary head -typical of many odd stylistic flourishes and &quot;wake-up&quot; calls Torre-Nilsson dots throughout the film -an obvious influence on Almodovar a couple of decades hence), Martin becomes the title figure. He imagines plots and intrigues on the part of the Spaniards and becomes obsessed. Looking forward to Leo DiCaprio as J. Edgar, I was impressed with the way Stathis embodied a similarly iconic role, South American style.\n\nSPOILERS ALERT: \n\nMartin finks on the Spaniards, having one of his chums turn them into the police for supposedly plotting against the fascist who&apos;s due on the parade route soon. The cops investigate and find the Spanish are merely innocent artistes, and Martin&apos;s identity as the fink is revealed. This results in a vividly staged, violent climax in which our would-be thug anti-hero gets a dose of his own medicine, reminiscent of the brutality by ordinary folks (in an extraordinary situation) that Hitchcock exploited in LIFEBOAT. This leads to an oddly romantic, ambiguous denouement as Ines surprisingly stands by her man.\n\nSeeing these two fabulous talents, neither of whom fashioned a career or achieved the stardom worthy of their initial films&apos; impact, is reason enough to discover THE EAVESDROPPER. Its local content and topical material (Torre-Nilsson forecasts the style of Haskell Wexler&apos;s classic MEDIUM COOL in several scenes deftly integrating real-life, documentary content with staged dramatics) were a bit impenetrable for me, especially viewing an untranslated Spanish-language print, but the overriding themes carry considerable bite."

      "reviewBody": "I can vividly remember the first time i saw this movie - it was during a festival of Japanese movies in an art house cinema here in Dublin. I must admit to never having heard of Ozu before, i went out of boredom and casual curiosity. I was embarrassed at the end to find myself in tears. I quickly wiped them away in that subtle way guys do when they don&apos;t want anyone to know, and got out to leave. What struck me was that even as the credits were finishing, I was one of the first to go. As i walked up the aisle I realized that most of the nearly full cinema was still sitting quietly, without the usual post movie chatter - and more than half of the audience had tears pouring down their faces. I have never, ever witnessed that in a cinema.\n\nSince then, i&apos;ve watched it on DVD, and had to think a lot about why such a simple movie is so powerful, and so many people rate it as one of the greatest ever. And why i find myself agreeing with that rating, i truly think it is in the top 10 ever made - certainly the top 5 of any I&apos;ve seen. But its hard at first to know why. It doesn&apos;t have the greatest script of any movie, there are few things in it that are truly original. The acting is great, but not the greatest ever seen, and the technical qualities are just average. I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that the reason for its greatness is that it comes closest to pure art in cinema. By pure art, i mean art that in its simplicity but technical genius still reveals deep truths about our lives. When i think about Tokyo Story I don&apos;t find myself comparing it to other movies, instead I think of a Rembrandt self portrait, a Vermeer painting, or my favourite short story, &apos;The Dead&apos; by James Joyce. It is simple, unadorned, and deeply wise. I realise in writing this I&apos;m rapidly approaching pseuds corner, but this is my genuine conclusion (writing as someone who is shamefully uneducated in most of the arts).\n\nOf course there have been many great movies about families, about growing old, about the nature of life.... but I think somehow Ozu achieved a sort of perfection with Tokyo Story. Thats why its the only movie I would give a &apos;10&apos; to.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though it is one of the weakest works of Hitchcock, the film surprisingly provides rich cinematic flourishes. For a 1939 film, it captures on screen the atmosphere and dark mood of the novel quite vividlythe stormy scene, the cave, and the inn (with the name board flapping in the wind). It is another matter that the albino parson of the book is transformed into a squire (with an unbelievable eyebrow make-up) in the film who commands his steed to be brought inside his dining hall. Daphne du Maurier&apos;s novel was adapted for cinema by the trio of Sidney Gilliat, Joan Harrison and J.B. Priestley, and reportedly the author did not approve of the end-product.\n\nAs in many Hitchcock films there is a recurring reference to marriage. Here a good woman remains faithful to her boorish and cruel husband through thick and thin.\n\nAs in most Hitchcock films there is a lot of sexual innuendo without any sex on screen, especially when Pengallen (Charles Laughton) makes the young girl (Maureen O&apos;Hara) his prisoner. (The only film where Hitchcock showed sex on screen was &quot;Frenzy.&quot;) And as in many a Hitchcock film, a bad guy turns out to be a good guy. This is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where the director does not make a cameo appearance.\n\nThe best cinematic flourishes were-the focus on the thin hands of the 17 year old who cannot be shackled by the soldiers as the handcuffs are too big, the opening &quot;prayer&quot; that serves as a grim introduction and finally the last scene of the film: Chadwick, the squire&apos;s butler, who thinks he can hear his dead master calling him for help in death.",

      "reviewBody": "Michael Anderson does a great job with this Hitchcockian melodrama, that even boasts a musical score reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann.\n\nTHE NAKED EDGE was, sadly, the against type epitaph to Gary Cooper&apos;s memorable career as an actor. Although he was dead by the time the finished film hit the screens, and he shows signs of some physical decay, Coop retains his economy of gestures and the expressive eyes. I found it odd that Kerr&apos;s name should come first in the opening credits, after all Coop had won two Oscars by then, while Kerr never picked up the statuette. At any, Coop and Kerr complement each other&apos;s acting, he as the hubby who appears to have something to hide, she as the doubting wife. The always dependable Portman as the heavy, Cushing as the prosecution lawyer, and Diane Cilento as the wife of the wrongly accused man complete the great cast.\n\nInteresting to compare Cilento&apos;s instinctive defense of her husband with Kerr&apos;s instinctive condemnation of hers.\n\nThe story is not that great or unusual, and you can easily spot some credibility holes, but it is very atmospheric. The sole drawback is that it pads the narrative with repetitive shots of similar facial expressions, and it could have done with 10 minutes less, especially the part where you see Cooper go into Portman&apos;s place, and then only shoes and trousers for a good 8 minutes, and suddenly everyone is back at Cooper&apos;s and Kerr&apos;s.\n\nUltimately, despite its flaws THE NAKED EDGE rates a must-see film noir, a definite must-see for the fans of that wonderful actor, Gary Cooper.",

When, at the same time, he loses his job on an Ostrich ranch and his daughter loses her hearing aid right before important school exams, he heads to Tehran on his motorbike to look for work. By accident, he becomes a motorbike taxi driver and begins to make more money than he ever dreamed of. But he also begins to change as his desire for things and his ethics collide. Having promised his wife that the first priority would be to replace their daughter&apos;s hearing aid, he finds himself tempted by the material life he now has access to. Several heart breaking incidents cause him to examine what he has become. While the story/parable may be familiar, what is special is the way Majidi presents it. The dialogue is minimal letting the non-verbal actions of the characters speak for themselves as well as the great cinematography. Unlike many (not all)American films, it does not insult your intelligence with shallow dialogue and unnecessary action. Majidi really develops the characters into believable human beings. Reza Naji is great as Karim and the children in the film are so delightful and photogenic. And if you enjoy learning about and experiencing other cultures, it is a great window into Iranian culture, in this case, both rural and urban. With most of us only getting the sound bites about Iran we hear on radio or TV, this will give an insight into the real people and culture.",

Kakoyianni&apos;s &quot;Stella&quot; , G. Javella&apos;s &quot;kalpiki lira&quot; and plenty worth-talking films produced on the 50s and 60s).The film is about a shady neighborhood in Piraeus , where most of the habitants are whores.The story is not the subject i am focusing on in this film ,(even though script is really well written). Main subject is atmosphere.. Most of the film is &quot;steamed&quot; by an almost underground, even mythical attitude , that leaves an irresistibly charming sense of decadence, &quot;forcing&quot; you to ignore any vulgarity that may seemingly exists .. The theatrical-like set is giving a quite real (although sometimes affectedly graphic) taste of the &quot;underworld&quot;. The heroines,(which have a lot of common characteristics with ancient-tragedies heroines), are incredible convincing at their prostitute-roles, (remarkable place posses Tzenny Karezi , whose acting power just ties the viewer down); also, two of the most acclaimed Greek actors acting , G.Fountas and M.Katrakis.Their acting is something more than the interpretations we are more or less used to.It is strong and genuine,without even a pinch of exaggeration, giving the impression that they were born in there.. I thing that what we have here ,in general , is some of the finest interpretations of the last 40 years. Viewing this picture,surely confirms the well-known &quot;rule&quot; that quality does not necessarily affected by &quot;low&quot; budget, as long as talented people exists that have desire and freedom to act at the highest level of their artistic skills.",

It makes no sense in any matter, and everything a director can make wrong, a scriptwriter can make wrong, and an actor/actress can make wrong, is made wrong. Every Teletubbie serial has more class and intelligence. It would make sense for a full drunken audience, but even filled with four bottles of wine I for myself would rather prefer to view a George Bush honor feature.\n\nAfter the first CGI disappeared and the first scene with people on a set begun, I realized that this is going really bad. It&apos;s strange that you can imagine how bad a movie will be already after a few seconds.\n\nI&apos;ve seen some bad movie&apos;s from the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s, they are great masterworks compared to The Terminators. Maybe in 200 years this movie is cult, but only in a future with the people from &quot;Idiocracy&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven&apos;t read the book, but I&apos;m considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn&apos;t help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn&apos;t, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn&apos;t exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you&apos;re a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don&apos;t be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it&apos;s an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don&apos;t miss this perfect film. 10/10",

Regardless of the easy critics: it&apos;s boring, there&apos;s no action, it&apos;s self-indulging, etc.., I would only add this. There will always be 2 kinds of people (whether they are film-goers, tourists, readers..): the ones who like to &quot;recognize&quot; things (the same stories being told, who is the hero, who is the villain? the same places to go to, the same food...) and the ones who like to discover new things. As to the film, why don&apos;t you try it? How many films have you seen that take your hand and take you to a place you&apos;ve never been before? On the contrary how often do you understand everything from the very first minutes of a movie? who is going to marry who, who is the bad guy, who&apos;s going to betray, will there be a happy end? Aren&apos;t you ever fed up with this? Try and see The Tree Of Life. It&apos;s about growing up in a family. It&apos;s about seeing the world through children&apos;s eyes. It&apos;s a very American story, and what it&apos;s like to be torn between religion, ideals and the lust for success and power and money. It&apos;s about betrayal by the people you trust. It&apos;s about love.\n\nYou may not like it but at least you&apos;ll have tried. Be curious! Stop being cinematographically correct.",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Borzage&apos;s films often take place in Europa .&quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; took the audience to France before and during WW1.And in the talkies era ,many of his works were depictions of Germany(&quot;Little Man What Now?&quot; &quot;Three Comrades&quot; &quot;Mortal Storm&quot; ).\n\n&quot;Street Angel&quot; is a Neapolitan effort.The follow -up to &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; ,with the same actors ,its first part is a bit erratic,recalling &quot;Heaven&quot; but without its focus and its intensity.But by the second third ,the movie really takes off ;it grabs you when Gino and Angela move into their small apartment in Napoli.And when the girl,about to be arrested,is given one hour&apos;s grace,Borzage&apos;s movie turns sublime.This hour ...this hour....If it were only for that scene,Janet Gaynor would deserve her AA hands down.This is really one of the most beautiful love scenes I have ever seen: you should see the actress smile ,laugh through her tears ,her intense happiness which she knows will be short-lived: and doing that without any words is a feat which is even more impressive today.\n\nOther remarkable scenes: When Angela is in Jail ,and Gino is desperately searching for her,the director makes a stunning use of the shadows.\n\nThe misty harbor &quot;where there are plenty of them (street angels)&quot; where the lovers meet again.\n\nAnd last but not least ,the painting (&quot;You should not have sold it,it was our guardian angel&quot; ) which plays a prominent part in the plot ;the final harrowing scene in the church is Gina&apos;s redemption.A sequence to rival the best of Murnau&apos;s &quot;Daybreak&quot; .\n\nFrank Borzage is the poet of the lovers who&apos;ve got to fight against a hostile world.&quot;On the street ,you will find people whose love and pain make great&quot; the director tells us before his story begins.",

      "reviewBody": "I attend to visit Weekend Of Horrors at Germany and let that place be the place to talk to German directors promoting their flicks. In 2005 I talked with Marc about his first feature Dungeon of Evil. The problem with that flick was the German language. Here we have the same problem. But there isn&apos;t that much spoken word in it and if it does you will understand 90% of it. The storyline is said in one sentence, it plays on a graveyard with living dead. You guessed it, you don&apos;t watch it for the storyline and you even don&apos;t watch it for the acting. But you just watch it for the gore and let me say that there is a lot of it in it. It clocks in at 90 minutes and that&apos;s maybe a bit too long. Some scene&apos;s are just made to promote some German bands with their song played in full length into the movie. Naturally the movie had a bit of reputation due Timo Rose as Ben having a small part in it (as promotion I guess). If you are a gorehound then this is surely one for you, it is really a splatter fest with some good effects. Another reason to buy the DVD is for the 5 shorts that are included as an extra. Here you see if that Marc can make a good story and flick like in Dark Awakening and Spider. Even funnier to see a remake of Spider done by Timo.",

Her acting skills came across quite well. I hope to see her in more mainstream films in the future. The other cast members did a good job of acting, too.\n\nThe music in this film is exceptional.\n\nAlthough this is by no means a fantastic movie, I think it deserves more than the 2.7 rating that the IMDb members gave it.",

The issues raised by the film are painfully highlighted by braindog&apos;s comments.\n\nDear &quot;Braindog,&quot;\n\nI went through a range of emotions as I read your comment on Twist of Faith. It began with anger, then disbelief, and finally pity. No, not pity for you. I don&apos;t know you at all. I feel pity for the endless line of children who are being sexually abused or will be in the years to come. A war on child sex abuse is like the war on terror or drugs; complete victory isn&apos;t possible, but that doesn&apos;t mean we stop fighting. Comments like yours are sheltered, insensitive, and dangerous. I pity the children who will be harmed because of a mindset like yours. The pedophile&apos;s best weapons come from other people. The public&apos;s silence, ignorance, and fear speaking against the popular view let pedophiles hide and endure because people won&apos;t attack child sex abuse head-on.\n\nHow old are you? How would you react if an authority figure, trusted, loved, friendly, advanced on you when you were 15? It&apos;s easier in today&apos;s instant-message, on-demand, Internet-savvy world to dismiss the filmmakers&apos; stories. It is harmful to think that because teens &quot;know&quot; about sex that they are mature enough to make the right decisions or have the strength to make sense of an insane reality, even today when sex and teens are synonymous in pop culture.\n\nDo you know the filmmakers? Do you know their families, go to their churches, attend their schools? I did. The film showed you the new reports, the testimonials, the tears, and the arraignments. What more did you want from it? This is a documentary, not a work of fiction.\n\nWhen you&apos;re older and perhaps have a teen-aged child of your own, maybe you&apos;ll begin to understand how young they are, how impressionable and vulnerable they are. You comments sickened me. They are children, and they need to be protect. And they need to be believed.",

      "name": "Jones and Samberg Forever",
      "reviewBody": "This film is pure candy. Rashida Jones wrote a story about a couple who love each other enough to call it quits while they&apos;re still in love. Both characters have flaws, but Samberg&apos;s character is to blame for the divorce because he&apos;s a child who is content to let his upwardly mobile wife carry the couple&apos;s financial responsibilities. As a result, Jone&apos;s character loses respect for him, and finds it hard to relate to him as a wife, but feels more like a mother. This is a common problem in relationships these days, and this script jumps right into the middle of the subject. The chemistry between Jones and Samberg is very believable, and they have the same quirk factor, so it&apos;s heartbreaking to watch their lives move in different directions when Samberg&apos;s beautiful one-night-stand-baby-mama shows up. The guy just can&apos;t do anything right. Then, he decides to do something right, and suddenly Jones&apos; starts back walking and taking inventory of what&apos;s out there versus what she already had. Elijah Wood was a nice touch as Rashida&apos;s gay business partner. Ari Gaynor played a peach of a best friend. In fact, all the supporting actors were perfect in this romantic drama comedy that required rapid fire quips, flippancy, and gut wrenching truths, culminating in a tearful confrontation between the two main characters that brought me to tears with its heartbreaking authenticity.\n\nSeems like Miss Jones is more than a pretty face, and Andy Samberg has range. If I had a criticism it would be that the film seemed primarily about Rashida&apos;s character, which made her character seem controlling and self absorbed. This made it a little harder to empathize with her character, however, she redeemed herself in the scene where she fell into and out of Samberg&apos;s trash can snooping, and got caught doing it. Hilarious. Chris Messina added a nice possibility.\n\nA very enjoyable and entertaining film.",

If you like your horror with a big fat daddy budget, this ain&apos;t for you. there&apos;s no CGI, There&apos;s no a-grade actors, there&apos;s no intense orchestral score by Danny Elfman. So, now, for the rest of you that are left - this movie is great. It has the same elements that made Peter Jacksons &quot;Braindead&quot; and &quot;Bad Taste&quot; so good, heart. the people who made this film obviously loved what they where doing and managed to pull off some great special effects and gore whilst doing so. i wish this film had another equally low-budget follow-up because the creatures are really great and after watching it you can almost smell all those 80&apos;s creature features looming round the corner. I would be very shocked if the people who made critters hadn&apos;t watched this first. So i recommend this anyone who likes mad little flesh eating beasties and lots and lots (and i do mean lots) of gore."

An old thief named Roy Egan (Harvey Keitel) , is drawn into the final jewel heist to Russian Mafia when his youngest brother named Lee (Timothy Hutton) asks him for a last score before they get out of the game . Lee forms a motley group (Keitel , Wade Dominguez and Stephen Dorff) to carry out the violent robbing . Unfortunately for him , Lee&apos;s picked one wrong partner and the events get worse . One of them decides he doesn&apos;t want to share the goods and betrays the group and happens murders and wreak havoc .The retired thief swears revenge on the lunatic who murdered his partners, while going on the run with the loot they stole.\n\nThis modern adaptation of noir cinema contains thrills , intrigue, explosive scenes of action and over-riding feeling of heat . Interesting premise in which takes places a moving cat-and-mouse hunt through the seedier sides of L.A . Exciting and stirring finale full of shootouts , violence and fights into a factory . Good performances from all-star cast as Harvey Keitel as an old pro robber who has vowed to avenge his brother , Stephen Dorff as a volatile , violent wheelman and Famke Janssen as a suffering wife . Nice musical score including an emotive song at the beginning . Colorful cinematography by Thomas Burstyn who permeates the whole movie even in the hours of night and darkness .\n\nThe motion picture is professionally directed by John Irvin with a well-achieved realization and elaborate scenes , though doesn&apos;t always live up to its promise . He worked extensively in TV before making his film debut with ¨The dogs of war¨ a cool rendition of a best-seller by Frederick Forsyth dealing with mercenaries in Africa. He went on directing ¨Ghost story¨ starred by old Hollywood-all-star and ¨Champions¨ about a courageous recovery from cancer stricken a steeple-chase jockey . After that , he realized a fine Vietnam movie as ¨The Hamburger Hill¨, ¨Turtle diary¨, an Arnold Szwenegger vehicle as ¨Raw Deal¨ and a good and realistic TV ¨Robin Hood¨. Finally , he made underrated films that not had the same inspiration since them as ¨Next of kin¨ , ¨Eminent domain¨ , ¨Freefall¨ and a sparkling comedy ,¨Widows peak¨ and is also of note a wartime genre as ¨When trumpets fade¨(1998). And of course , ¨City of Industry¨ , being one of the jewels in Irvin&apos;s crown , it results to be one of this most interesting works and an efficient contemporary Noir which had moderated success .",

Eleven years after his death, his music still holds a huge following and unfortunately exploited. In this movie, he plays a Bruce Lee-esque character who defeats the villains and suffers for it in the end. I love this movie because I&apos;m a huge fan of Tsoy&apos;s band &quot;KINO&quot; otherwise I wouldn&apos;t pay much attention to it. Great soundtrack and interesting photography. Unfortunately Tsoy was not an actor and he was pretty much playing himself. Pyotr Mamonov, ex-leader of Russian experimental band &quot;Zvuki Mu&quot; probably was the best actor but received a minor role.",

      "reviewBody": "I borrowed this tape from a friend of mine. He said this is an awful film and well, he was right... Only reason I was interested of this piece of crap was the music, it was made by Tangerine Dream. The music was a disappointment, it sounded like there was just one or two tunes (not even close to the best Tangerine Dream) repeated on and on and on... The acting was bad, filming was bad, editing was bad and the dialog was dubbed from German to English, which just added a one more bad thing. I just couldn&apos;t watch this without fast forwarding half of it.\n\nBest laughs I got from the ultimately bad action-scene where the bad guys were running away from the good guys on a narrow corridor and everything in that scene was so cheesy... The acting was just ridiculous, the filming and editing were bad and the whole scene just didn&apos;t work - not at all. And of course, this is one of those films where EVERY sound of footstep were added afterwards... So the walking and running are always a funny concert of multiple TAP-TAP-TIPPETY-TAP footsteps. Every shoe HAD to have a tap-sound. You can hear the same effect in 70&apos;s kungfu-flicks too.\n\nSo... I don&apos;t have anything good to say about this. I tried but... no. =)",

I just found out that the Robert Merle&apos;s book was adapted for the big screen - or even small one. What a wonderful surprise for me. So interesting and distrubing to put yourself into Rudolph Hoess - do not confound with the Hitler&apos;s sidekick who flought to Britain in 1941 - Rudolph Hoess&apos; head, the big executive of Auschwitz extermination camp who monitored it as a regular factory, with production goals, performances, to achieve, preserve or enhance,, the same with the work rate, pace, to increase. A man who was also a good family man, getting home every evening, as any normal worker or manager. This.contrast is the most disturbing for anyone. Anyone. There was no real hate in his behavior, only the taste of the.job well done. This film shows his story in a very accurate way. And WHO better than Germans can do this? Who? Russians, Americans, British?\n\nLET ME LAUGH!!!!\n\nNow I update this review by saying that, in 2023, another film was made on the subject, also involving Rudolph Hoess: ZONE OF INTEREST.",

It&apos;s quite watchable, has a couple of very funny moments, and the mostly good-natured story works pretty well.\n\nDonald Keith and Clara Bow are likable and believable as the two leads, although Keith and his character are somewhat one-dimensional - Bow gets less screen time but is more memorable.  The supporting cast are all pretty good, and represent familiar characters - the protective parents, the concerned coach, and fellow students of various types.  The story centers on Keith&apos;s character, an athletic star who falls in love with Cynthia (Bow) but soon finds that he cannot have everything at once.  To a large degree it represents some of the kinds of decisions faced in any era by those of college age (or what the film calls the &quot;Plastic Age&quot;).  All of the characters are presented sympathetically, which gives it a pleasant tone throughout."

      "reviewBody": "The year is 2127, and a descendent of the maker of the box that opens the gate to Hell is trying to figure out a way to open the box and trap the demons that come out of Hell. He has commandeered a space station (that he himself designed) for this task. He opens the box, lets the demons out, and is detained (people begin to investigate his questionable behavior on the ship) before he can capture them. Almost the entire film is told in the form of a story which he tells the people holding him, in an effort to get them to let him go so he can finish his work. Needless to say, it takes a lot of gory deaths to convince them. \n\nThere is a small bit of tension created by the fact that the entire time he is telling the guards what is going on, the Cenobites are out and are on the ship. However, this is largely forgotten about for the majority of the film because so much of it takes place in 18th century France, the time when the box was created. Basically, some toymaker makes the box, opens it, demons show up, and they terrorize his family for generations. You&apos;d think they&apos;d be grateful because he let them out into the world of the living. Anyway, the guy in 2127 has taken upon himself the task of building a NEW box that will be sort of an antidote to the first box, one that is designed so that it can actually trap LIGHT inside. \n\nIt&apos;s an interesting enough story, and it was actually fairly entertaining, but the film itself was still somewhat lacking. The acting was pretty bad (but at least Ashley Laurence was blissfully absent again), and there wasn&apos;t much effort put into the directing. The movement back and forth from the distant future to the distant past was also a bit detrimental at times to the tension of the story, but luckily the film did present a few cool new cenobites (one that was satisfactorily created out of a couple of idiot security guards), and Bloodline also displayed probably one of Pinhead&apos;s best performances ever. I would say that Bloodline is more of an informational movie than a good Hellraiser movie. While it is interesting to watch, it is almost more informational than entertaining. So even though the movie itself may have been disappointing, I think that it is a good addition to the series as a whole. It works better within the Hellraiser series than it does by itself.",

Typical story, guy (Fabian Busch) falls in love with girl (Monica Nancy Wick), everything goes wrong and somehow hes just living an awfully boring life where nothing ever works out. And I mean nothing. However ordinary I thought the story was in the beginning (although I almost fell from the seat laughing at that mullet memorial guy), it turned out to be very original. Wont be telling you, though... watch it yourselves. Amazed by what you can create with almost no budget! Its definitely worth having in your DVD collection. While you&apos;re at it, get the soundtrack too ;) Damn good music!!",

Fletcher charges him for a rent of US$ 200,00, otherwise he would be thrown out of his home. Although working washing dishes in a restaurant, whose owner Toad (Oliver Platt) humiliates him very often, Zig Zag does not have the money and becomes worried with the situation. Zig Zag sees Toad opening his safe, memorizes the combination and in the night he steals almost ten thousand dollars. When he comes back home, Fletcher takes all the money from him and uses it to repay a loan to the dangerous Cadillac Tom (Luke Goss). Singer (John Leguizamo) is the best friend of Zig Zag and when knows what he did, he decides to return the money to Toad&apos;s safe, otherwise Zig Zag would be sent to a reformatory. However, Singer is very sick, having a terminal cancer, and her uses the support of the prostitute Jenna (Natasha Lyonne) to accomplish his intent. This movie is almost good, but something does not work well in the story. The cast has a great performance, but the genre is too corny for a drama, too slow for an adventure and too dramatic for a comedy. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `Conduta Ilegal&apos; (`Illegal Behavior&apos;)",

Some of the dialogue made me mess my pontaloons! The story is boggo standard and many scenes are clearly influenced by the daddy of all adventure movies Indiana Jones but on a shoestring budget...nay even a sandal-string budget. The action fight scenes were woefully choreographed as though they were having a bit of a fun day out in the fields playing Japs and Commandos boys with guns but the photography, although it is wobbly and totally incoherent at times it is actually a bit refreshing and for some utterly inexplicable reason I did find some of the movie quite fun!\n\nYes it is dreadfully unoriginal and made on the budget of 10p and a bag of monkey nuts but it is different and I like different, I also like Dolph even though he cannot act worth a dime but he looks so good for a guy of 51 so I give it a fair 4 x AK47&apos;s out of 10 on my action-o-mometer!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;An incredibly powerful film creation. The sounds, the music, and the visual world are all familiar and authentic to me because I, too, was a novice worker around that time. I lived (live) in the Havanna housing estate and commuted to Kobánya to work under similar circumstances. At the end of the film, when Zsuzsa takes her daughter back from Jutka, it&apos;s heart-wrenching. Erika Ozsda delivered an outstanding performance in this scene (as well). Scenes played with such depth and elemental force are rarely seen nowadays. By the way, it&apos;s an excellent cinematographic idea to frequently show the main character&apos;s face in a wide shot because Erika Ozsda&apos;s face is exceptionally expressive. The subtle movements of her big, beautiful, dark, expressive eyes reveal her emotions well. Behind her simple, somewhat neglected appearance, her voice, and her behavior, there is intelligence, resourcefulness, and deep emotions hidden. She&apos;s an extraordinary talent, a shining diamond discovered by Pál Erdoss.\n\n&quot;Pál Erdoss started as a disciple of the founders of the Budapest School. However, his first film, &apos;Adj király katonát&apos; (1982), was a revelation, mainly thanks to the talent of Erika Ozsda, whom he discovered. The film takes us into an unseen world until now: a young girl from the countryside, orphaned even by her foster parents, moves from the village to Budapest and finds work at the Fonó in Pestlorinc, just as those like her almost inevitably found unskilled, cheap labor in the weaving industry at that time. She drifts alone, hardened by her own failures, and increasingly resists the world.\n\nThese films belong to the trend of the educational films of the 1980s. Unlike the educational films of the 1950s, here, the formal and informal re-education is not carried out in the name of a communal vision of the future, but rather, it is the impact of societal changes that shapes and forces young people onto certain paths of development. The fate of institutionalized children and young people without a family background thus becomes exemplary in the 1980s. This is how, through them, society&apos;s selfishness, hypocrisy, insensitivity, and the incompetence of its institutions for upbringing are exposed (e.g., &apos;Vasárnapi szülok,&apos; 1979, &apos;Kabala,&apos; 1981, directed by Rózsa János).&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Shot in Rome,usually known in the English speaking world as &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;(so like &quot;Thunderball&quot;!),this movie is an especially tacky example of the Euro-Superspy genre of the 1960&apos;s.Often these movies starred second string American actors to help US sales-and this has Anthony Eisley(best known as a lead in the TV detective series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;),who spent a lot of his career in such Euro schlock.Handsome,tough looking and businesslike,Eisley was suitable for these kinds of roles,but here he is immersed in a distinctly third rate &quot;Bond&quot; caper.The story has elements from &quot;Dr No&quot;(villain who shoots down US moon rockets-cue the grainy stock footage of Cape Kennedy which fills the movie),but here the tale is clumsily developed and full of absurdities.The villain,vaguely resembles Goldfinger,and is-wait for it-a fiendish beer manufacturer,just like the villain in the Matt Helm movie &quot;The Ambushers&quot;(1967).Eisley&apos;s hero &quot;Harry Sennet&quot; at times acts with incredible stupidity.He drives right on to a rocket launch site to try and stop it leaving-just as it blasts off!In another unprofessional moment,Sennet,captured and surrounded by thugs,goes into a rage and tries to attack the gloating villain,when it&apos;s obvious he will fail and just gets more battering from the bad guys for his trouble-007 would be appalled!And here is a hero who more than once tries to &quot;buy off&quot; enemies by offering them cheques!(a wonderfully absurd scene has him doing a cheque for a gunman who&apos;s ready to shoot him!). The English dubbing is clear but often incongruous(a renowned rocket scientist who speaks in a &quot;Barry Fitzgerald&quot; Irish burr?).To try to make the narrative more coherent,we have Sennet providing a frequently cornball &quot;tough guy&quot; voice-over at certain points.\n\nI did quite like the villainess with an acid squirting gun,and the &quot;underwater city&quot; hideout has a certain threadbare pop art mid 60&apos;s charm(with its ice-chamber where the villain stores his frozen victims).The final action and destruction scenes are far better done than the rest of the movie,the director seems more at home with fighting/mayhem than other aspects of film making.\n\nThere are a lot of better examples of 60&apos;s Eurospy out there,but &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; is tolerable if you are interested in the genre.",

      "reviewBody": "So often sensitive or taboo subjects are avoided, and it&apos;s better to be open and honest about them so we can gain a better understanding of ourselves and those around us.\n\nIf a person is 24 and is in a relationship with a 16 yr old, is that wrong? What about 30 and 16? 40 and 16? The film argues that girls mature sooner than boys, and for thousands of years our life expectancy was 33 so it made sense to reproduce as soon as the woman came of age (began menses) In the film, they interview a female pedophile. Her graphic story was difficult for me to hear. Another shocking moment is when they interview a woman who was repeatedly raped as a child by her father and a neighbor.\n\nThey also interview a man who is out about being a pedophilia. During that interview it is noted that pedophilia is an orientation, not an action. The man interviewed claims to be a non-exclusive, non-offending pedophile, meaning he admits he is sexually attracted to children, but is also attracted to adults and does not act on his attraction to children. He believes a lot of people are attracted to kids; they just won&apos;t dare to acknowledge it.\n\nWhat about the weird sexualization of girls in our society, such as making sweatpants for little girls with words like &quot;JUICY&quot; on the butt? Makeup for kids grooms them for future sexual advertising. And of course, there&apos;s the whole beauty pageants for little girls racket.\n\nA friend of mine went to jail for a year because his friend sent him a topless picture of his girlfriend. Turns out the girlfriend was 16 and he got busted for possession of child porn. When he got out of jail he found a job, but was fired two weeks later when the employer found out about his criminal record.\n\nChid porn is people under age 18 who are portrayed in sexual, lewd conduct erotic behavior. So wouldn&apos;t that mean that many magazine ads are child porn? This film digs into these topics and more.",

The fashion industry on the one hand sexualizes ever-younger girls while those who act on these instincts are reviled. The apparent hypocrisy at the heart of society forces the question: What do we mean when we talk about Pedophilia? \r\n\r\nThe film explores the many dangers children face and exposes the systematic violation of children rights by societies, presenting the testimony of both victims and perpetrators. It also looks at how the pedophilia hysteria that has led to the mass incarceration adults and children. In conclusion, we are faced with both the contradiction of a society which sexualizes youth and the question: Are All Men Pedophiles?",

      "reviewBody": "*1/2 out of (****)\n\n&quot;When in Rome&quot; actually looked pretty decent judging by its advertisements and the cast wasn&apos;t too shabby either. I thought I&apos;d leave my brain at the door and enjoy the film for its silly, nonsensical ride. It turns out that When in Rome is every bit as typical, dry, and unfunny as every romantic comedy you&apos;ve seen. Even when the film has its moments, which are very minimal, the energy that was once there, had been drained out. The problem isn&apos;t that the film is formulaic and predictable, because that&apos;s what we&apos;ve come to expect. The problem is that this film has no energy and basically no backbone. But the main issue is its script. The jokes couldn&apos;t feel more forced, empty, and missing more punch lines. For a comedy, you&apos;ll laugh maybe twice, if that. Although, here&apos;s the million dollar question: What&apos;s redeeming about this movie? It&apos;s formulaic, it&apos;s tedious, it&apos;s predictable, it&apos;s nonsensical, it&apos;s hollow, and its energy has been drained.\n\nStop me if you&apos;ve heard this before: Beth (Bell) is a workaholic, which basically corrupts her chances of finding that perfect man. Beth goes to Italy, Rome to see her sister get married to a man and there she meets the &quot;one&quot;, which is Nick (Duhamel). She picks up coins from the fountain and there a group of men fall in love with Beth, but there&apos;s a problem. She only loves Nick and the men keep ruining the chance of her being with the one. But another issue arises. Does Nick really love her back, or is it just because she picked up his coin from the fountain, which makes people fall in love?\n\nWhen in Rome&apos;s main issue is the dialogue. Not one piece of dialogue is note-worthy, memorable, or even watchable. The dialogue is completely inane and pretty much below average. The script, is also another issue. The script is dry, as predictable as it can be, and simply just awful. On a 1 to 10 scale, 1 being the lowest, 10 being the highest, the predictability level for this one, is easily a 10. I can see every scene coming from a mile away. Did I mention it&apos;s a chore to sit through? Well at least the performances are watchable.\n\nOverall &quot;When in Rome&quot; is nothing special, and in fact feels so much like every other film out there, that&apos;s it&apos;s pointless to see it. It&apos;s by-the-numbers, predictable, and disposable. There are a lot of flaws and very few redeeming qualities. I expected a mediocre film, but I also expected a fun time, which I didn&apos;t get here. Wow, what ever happen to the good romantic comedies? &quot;When in Boredom&quot; is a rental at best.",

The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn&apos;t invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn&apos;t care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that&apos;s worth the concession price.",

I could still recite most of the dialog from memory. This is much much better than the animated &quot;Jungle Book&quot; to me because it&apos;s so much more real. Real live animals, real jungle flora, it&apos;s just perfect. I also didn&apos;t know who John Cleese was at the time, but now I can appreciate his excellent sense of humor.\n\nMowgli and Katherine have such wonderful chemistry as well. They have a history, and it&apos;s easier to feel for characters who do. The soldiers were well cast, with Harley being my favorite. While I prefer Cary Elwes in &quot;The Princess Bride,&quot; he&apos;s still a good lead and bad guy. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn&apos;t seen it yet.",

And exploration of the human condition in extraordinary circumstances of advanced technology.\n\nSome may find this movie slow, but I thought it was beautiful.

But the reality is enough to make you say &apos;yes!&apos; at the end.\n\nVery earthy performances from the leads. Believable in every situation. Scott is well cast as an unassuming star,. Kurt Russell adds pulling power to the credits and has not been cast without reference to his ability to play characters we can all relate to.\n\nScott Murphy&apos;s character mirrors the perennially struggling farmers in not only USA but here in my home as well. He portrays admirably the shielded turmoil of men of the land fighting bad turns daily and then gritting , bearing and getting on with the job until all seems lost. Never allow this to impact his optimistic outlook for his children.\n\nTruly credible performance."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m totally baffled by the way Alex Cox&apos;s &apos;Walker&apos; has been ignored, vilified, criticised, ridiculed and slandered over the years. Maybe it&apos;s political message cuts too close to the bone, or maybe the mainstream movie critics are even more conservative and short sighted than you think. Maltin gives it a BOMB rating, and even the usually perceptive Ebert totally dismisses it. Forget them! Watch &apos;Walker&apos; and make your own mind up.\n\n &apos;Walker&apos; is certainly no masterpiece, it has many flaws and problems. It isn&apos;t subtle political satire (polemic?), it&apos;s often crude and ill advised. Some of the actors, especially Marlee Matlin and Gerrit Graham are under-used. However, it is FAR from a &quot;bomb&quot;! Cox is a passionate man, and any failings here are due to that passion. The movie is a cry for help for Nicaragua and its people, and draws parallels between America&apos;s involvement in the 19th century and the 1980s. \n\nThis movie is clever, stupid, rough, accomplished, funny and tragic all at the same time. Ed Harris is marvellous in the title role, and many cult actors turn up in supporting roles. Cox is a Peckinpah devotee and some of that great director&apos;s influence can be seen on screen. But Cox is no carbon copy he&apos;s a true original. &apos;Repo Man&apos; shows that, and anyone who enjoyed that or &apos;Sid And Nancy&apos; should take a look at this, one of the most unjustly ignored movies of the 80s."

      "reviewBody": "Along with War and Peace, Anna Karenina is one of the greatest Russian novels and one of the greats of 19th century literature, the story is heart-breaking and intense and the characters compelling. Anna Karenina has often been filmed, and of the film versions the 1967 Russian and 1935 Greta Garbo films fare the best and the 2012 Joe Wright-directed version the weakest. This 1997 adaptation from Bernard Rose (Paperhouse, Immortal Beloved, Candyman) has a good amount to like but is one of the weaker adaptations.\n\nVisually, the film looks absolutely stunning and along with the 1967 Russian film it is one of the most evocative adaptations period detail-wise. Although some of the editing is choppy, the cinematography is ravishing and the costumes and sets are some of the most beautiful and evocative of any adaptation of Anna Karenina, especially in the opulent ballroom scene and the gorgeous wintry landscapes. The Tchaikovsky-laden music score makes for an aural feast and couldn&apos;t have fitted more perfectly.\n\nThree performances are good. Coming off best is Alfred Molina, who brings authority and many layers to Levin, wish more was done with developing the character more in terms of writing but at least the film included the character and his subplot with Kitty. James Fox is a ruthlessly cold and haunting Karenin, the character played consistently well in all the Anna Karenina adaptations even in the not-so-good ones. Sean Bean is a handsome Vronsky, but brings a steely intensity to the role that stops the character from being wooden or tragic, rightfully avoiding the dashing heroic figure stereotype.\n\nSophie Marceau however I found miscast as Anna, she looks splendid but is pretty vacuous and lacking in passion. Her chemistry with Bean convinces in the latter and more turbulent parts of the relationship but dull in the early parts. Mia Kirschner is also rather too modern and lightweight for Kitty. This version of Anna Karenina is a visual and aural stunner with a few impressive performances, but is one of the least successful and interesting versions in terms of script and how the story is told.\n\nThe dialogue doesn&apos;t always flow naturally, and feels very dry in tone and with little depth and substance, and the narration was rather unnecessary. Rose&apos;s direction shows terrific technical assurance but lacks the same kind of momentum in telling the story. It&apos;s the story where the film most falls down, feeling far too short and far too rushed, with about half of the story (or so it feels) being told but all in Cliff Notes version, and it even feels like more of the film was filmed but cut due to studio interference. Neither of the romances are dealt with well, Anna and Vronsky&apos;s is too rushed and the very incomplete-feeling one between Levin and Kitty sometimes really slows down the film.\n\nOverall, not a bad version but a less than ideal one, as an adaptation and as a film on its own. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

A complete mess, salvaged only in a couple of scenes where blasts of happy music set the tone, rather than the actors. With the exception of Susanne von Borody, who gives a good performance. We should have known: this one was out of cinemas within a week. And number 3 is in the making.",

The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude women or bad acting, rent any porno movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is pure art, plain and simple. Even if the movie might not be to your taste (a lot of people don&apos;t like this film at all, and they find it boring and meaningless). Hopefully one can agree it is really nice to know that there was once a time and place when American Independent Cinema really had a heart and soul and it is in full exhibition here. Classification avant-garde.\n\nVincent Gallo wrote the story and screen play, directed the film, and was the main star. Vincent Gallo fresh out of a five-year prison stint who really needs to take a leak but can&apos;t find a bathroom anywhere.\n\nEasily one of the best contemporary actresses ever, Christina Ricci (who plays Layla), enters and is literally kidnapped by Vincent&apos;s character. This happens realistically, with a dark sense of humor-- (in a building where he almost finds a toilet), brings her to his family and poses her as his wife. We then get a wonderful half-hour of the biggest generation gap in history in which Gallo, Ricci and his parents, Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara, have the most complicated anti-bonding dinner in history.\n\nThis indie gem is downright brilliant with wonderful imagery, antique film stock, strategically placed camera-angles and split screens that all work to embody the dreamlike... or rather... nightmarish quality. Also, needing to be mentioned it the soundtrack of this movie which personally I believe to be among the best, featuring original music from writer, director and star Vincent Gallo as well as prog-rock artists like Yes and King Crimson. Buffalo &apos;66 is an exceptional film IMO.\n\n\n\nInteresting cinematography note: Buffalo &apos;66 was shot on a Reversal stock that the NFL used to use to film games back in the 1970s. It was out of production and Gallo&apos;s production gathered all they could to shoot the film and give it it&apos;s gorgeous wintery palette.\n\nIn real life : Ricci and Gallo did not fancy one another.\n\nModel, actor-director and sometimes singer Vincent Gallo has a very good memory ... and very, very loose lips to match. Gallo, who wrote, directed and starred in the darling indie film &quot;Buffalo 66&quot; in 1998, has reportedly talked smack about Christina Ricci, his co-star in the film, to a New York Post Page Six columnist, according to a Mr. Showbiz report.\n\nGallo: &quot;It was OK when she wasn&apos;t drunk on the set. I think she&apos;s an alcoholic -- it was either that, or she was on cough syrup the whole time,&quot; Gallo allegedly said about Ricci.\n\nHold on, it gets better/worse .\n\n&quot;I don&apos;t like her,&quot; Gallo reportedly blabbered on. &quot;She&apos;s an ungrateful c***. But it was OK. She&apos;s basically a puppet. I told her what to do, and she did it.&quot;\n\nAnd better/worse.\n\n&quot;She lost 17 pounds, and that was because I only let her eat one whole pizza pie every day,&quot; he said.\n\nAnd this was Ricci&apos;s response in an interview from 2007 (questions bolded this time):\n\nQuote: It&apos;s ten years since you made &apos;Buffalo 66&apos; with Vincent Gallo.\n\nI was seventeen, yeah. It was my first movie away without my mother. Not a wise choice. I really didn&apos;t understand what was going on most of the time working with a crazy lunatic man. I&apos;d never encountered such insanity.\n\nHe said some nice things about your weight.\n\nOh yes, I&apos;ve been there. Horrible things. He waited three or four years and then decided to make fun of my weight at the time that we were shooting &apos;Buffalo 66&apos;. He waited that long to make fun of a seventeen-year-old. It&apos;s so bizarre, and I hadn&apos;t seen him in years, I hadn&apos;t done anything to him. It was just like: okay, a. s . s hole.\n\nDid you get on with him when making the film?\n\nNo, not really. He&apos;s one of those people who sometimes he&apos;s so nice to you and then the next he imagines that you&apos;ve done something horrible and he&apos;ll start screaming at you. It&apos;s difficult to get on well with someone like that.\n\nDid you see his next film, &apos;The Brown Bunny&apos;? Oh, I didn&apos;t see it. I have no interest in seeing anything he ever does again.",

      "reviewBody": "Just as Veronica Guerin exposed Ireland&apos;s underworld drug dealers, Cate Blanchett&apos;s marvelous portrayal of Irish journalist-turned-anti-drug-crusader Veronica Guerin seemed to have the actress on a mission to prove that you don&apos;t have to look like a pop diva or act like a porn star to be a compelling female lead in a film.\n\nLike many films with an ethnic flavor, we get a supporting cast of ethnic actors in slightly elevated roles from the norm. Most notable from that category are Gerard McSorley as the evil drug-lord, John Gilligan, and Ciaran Hands as street thug John Traynor, who plays both sides of the fence throughout the film.\n\nThe story is painful, not only because of what happens to Guerin, but in our knowing that her courage is a direct reaction to our general apathy towards wrongdoing, with so many of us looking the other way that the Veronica Guerins of the world are encouraged to fight evil after the fact, but left as sitting ducks or thrown to the wolves while they are still alive and making noise.\n\nIf there&apos;s one lesson every viewer of this film should exit with, it is that those of us who are not part of the solution, are part of the problem.",

It&apos;s only in the supportive society of the maids that the film offers something unfamiliar.\n\nThe technical work is excellent with master editor De Roma on hand.

I was fortunate enough to have been a Project Engineer on the Apollo Program, and I am familiar with the technical aspects of the program. But this movie was not as much about the technical aspects of the program as it was about a thrilling, real-life drama that just happened to take place during a glorious time and a once-in-a-lifetime project. Despite all of the little technical errors, Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film, one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that present-day film-makers would concentrate on happy situations, like this one, instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we, the movie-going public, are made subject. Long live NASA and long live courage!!",

However, the style is a marked departure from the director&apos;s German work and the Hollywood treatment keeps this film from being as compelling as its older brother.\n\nHailing from the Midwest as I do, the Hooterville Junction take on small-town America rankled with me a bit. Gossipy housewives and self-important businessmen are played for laughs and then suddenly turn into a howling mob bent on the death of a man against whom the &quot;evidence&quot; is literally peanuts. It&apos;s a serious matter, as we&apos;re later reminded by the prosecutor&apos;s speech about the number of lynchings in America&apos;s then recent history, it should never have been treated lightly.\n\nDo watch it though, and keep an eye out for a very familiar Cairn terrier. Also, early on when Joe and Katherine are looking at bedroom furniture there&apos;s a distinct chuckle at the expense of the Hays Code (which was enforced starting in &apos;34).",

Don&apos;t get me wrong, the women in &quot;Bad Girls&quot; look great in their Western outfits, and they do a fine acting job as well, but only Drew Barrymore really convinces as a &quot;bad girl&quot; - you can see the fire of intensity burning in her eyes (Madeleine Stowe is a close second - at times she is convincingly defiant). And for a &quot;feminist&quot; Western, the women get mistreated rather frequently. But the biggest problem with this film is an unfocused script that never really takes off. &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was a big commercial and critical flop, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s such a bad movie - it&apos;s just not as good as it should have been.

I just wanted to add that I have recently obtained (on eBay) a Greek issue of the DVD which, while providing the option of Greek subtitles, ALSO provides the option for the soundtrack to be in German or dubbed English. In my opinion, the dubbing is very successful and, for an English fan of the film who is ignorant of the German language, understanding the verbal humour is a very special bonus.",

Rosa had to marry her younger brother-in-law after he turned of age, and she had to remain with her dead husband&apos;s family. I am just happy that laws like those do not exist in our American customs.\n\nI recorded this movie on a VHS tape, but thanks to today&apos;s technology, I don&apos;t have a viable way of watching the videotape. I donated boxes of VHS tapes and this movie was on one of the videotapes. The acting was good and the story was believable, and a few of the characters added some spice to the story line. I am happy that I located the title of the movie. I would think about this movie over the years. Maybe I will purchase it on DVD or perhaps get a chance to stream it. Good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The &apos;grunge&apos; explosion of the early and mid nineties was quite possibly the single most contrived piece of marketing in the history of western civilisation, neatly packaging raw emotion and powerful self expression, diluting it into managable and meanigless chunks, and then reselling it to emotionally challanged teenagers. All the bad stuff that came with that social mini revolution often makes us forget all the fun we used to have before 1991 and Nevermind. But this documentary provides ample reminder of that time. Fusing blistering live performances from some of THE great underground bands of the 1980&apos;s - 1990&apos;s (stand up Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jnr, Gumball and Babes in Toyland), with tiny snippets of backstage larks that truly portray the excitment of the period. What is truly exceptional about this piece is its subtlety in the presentation of the major issues of the time, namely the issue of old school punk ethics versus the attitudes of the increasingly main stream fans the bands were attracting. A good example of this is the way Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth dispenses a mocking impersenation of a grumpy Irish scooter &apos;fan&apos; (&quot;I&apos;m planning to put the front cover of &apos;Goo&apos; on me scooter&quot; Oh PLEASE!). The actual moment itself was so brief you could easily miss it, but it brilliantly sums up the attitudes of all the bands to this new audience they were attracting, and with whom they shared no common ideas or beliefs. Ao=nother joy of this film is that you get to see a pre-fame Nirvana, Shock Horror!, having FUN. Since his suicide the media has tended to paint Kurt Cobain as a tragic figure, consumed by inner - demons and constantly living under a black cloud. Yet here Kevin Kerslake shows a lighter, more human, side to this near mythological individual and also offers us what l feel to be one of the most powerful images of the century. After falling of stage and into the crowed, Kurt is pulled back onto the stage by Thurston, both with big smiles on their faces, having fun, and totally unaware of the tragedy that we, with the benfit of hindsight, know will soon befall them. Kerslake further emphasizes this moment by freezing it for just enough time to allow the full meaning of the image to sink in. A truly exceptional representation of the unifying spirit of the old, and sadly long gone, underground network.\n\n\n\n OR maybe they were just all having a laff. You know, a bunch of really cool bands with alot to say and a big noise to make who just wanted to get out their and make some eardrums bleed. Oh well, its only rock and roll but l like it."

      "reviewBody": "In Saigon, 1951, Thomas Fowler (Michael Fowler) is an English journalist, married in England with a catholic woman, and in love with a Vietnamese girl, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). Thomas meets Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) in a bar. Pyle is a doctor working in an aid mission, and pretty soon, he falls in love with Phuong. Pyle offers her what Thomas is not possible to give, i.e., a marriage and escape of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the political situation in Vietnam is boiling, with the French trying to get control again of the country, the communists trying to impose their system to the South, and the American secretly giving support to a third Vietnamese part. \n\nThis romance is perfect: the outstanding performance of Michael Caine in the first plane, and Brendan Fraser (in his best role, since &apos;Gods and Monsters&apos;) and Do Thi Hai Yen are fantastic. The screenplay of Christopher Hampton, based in a novel of Graham Greene, is wonderful. And the direction of Phillip Noyce is magnificent, presenting the story in right doses of romance, drama, action and special effects. An overwhelming movie for all tastes. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Americano Quieto&quot; (&quot;The Quiet American&quot;)",

The movie starts as a slow-boil suspense/horror movie, provides some decent jump-scares (at least in the theater) and spends some time building up character. The movie then switches gears and turns into a gritty, brutal horror movie more the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and further switches to gears to a action/revenge movie, but still with horror elements. It&apos;s scary, sick, nearly uncompromising (the unrated cut will undoubtedly be so) and disturbing, but also adrenaline-filled and riveting. Certainly NOT for the weak-stomached person. People were leaving the theater, and the IMDb boards are rife with people damning the movie for it&apos;s &apos;lack of moral substance&apos; and &apos;taste&apos;. This movie isn&apos;t for the average movie-goer. It&apos;s for the horror buffs. Alexendre Aja should be proud, and is 2-for-2 in my book having done this and High Tension.",

I think it testifies a typical mood of 60&apos;s, with sexual freedom, new forms of attraction, and mockeries about middle-class&apos; values. Here the author attacks the institution of marriage, and the conception of couple, playing with the characters as with the pieces of chess. Five main characters look for a balance of their sexual life, but the only solution seems to be the triangle, a new form of social institution, regular as the couple and the marriage. The film shows a very old style, no more valuable, with primary colours, heavy make-ups and some aged machine movements. And the characters are unbelievable, speaking by some literary style and far from any likelihood, but the subtended theory is interesting, sarchastic, acid, painful, and finally delivering and anti-hypocritical. And the cast is great, particularly Trintignant, Girardot and Musante. And what a marvellous score!!! Viva Ennio Morricone!!!",

Richard Gere is really extremely good and in  fact as time goes on his role may actually turn out to be one of his best.  He has such a fragile bravado in this tale of selfish loner turns good.  Debra Winger and Louis Gossett are also outstanding.  It is a movie that you either love or you hate and, over the years, the critics have very much wanted to play it down but there is no doubt in my mind that it is a classic tale well told with every aspect of &quot;the cinema&quot; used to its fullest extent"

Kudos and a clink of the champagne glass to all involved, a labour of love that delivered.\n\nFrom it&apos;s humble beginnings to it&apos;s controversial subtexts, revealing interviews piece together the history of the elm street series and paint a portrait of the horror community that made me stand up and applaud &quot;Yes I am a horror fanatic and yes I am proud&quot; Much we have seen before on the pretty comprehensive 8 disc set of Nightmares that New Line put out a decade or so ago, but so much new material and history has happened since then.\n\nThe lowlight for me was seeing former studio head Bob Shaye, a man broken after losing control of his studio due to politics. And when he broke down on camera, so did I, who would have thought, in tears in a documentary about the &quot;ELm Street&quot; series. SHeesh I must be getting sentimental in my old age. Every character actor from every movie is interviewed in depth and a running time of four hours - it still felt short! By the end the film had me standing and clapping at the screen like so many teen girls on their first Twilight viewing. Awesome Awesome Awesome. A Perfect 10.",

But she didn&apos;t do a lot of stuff as she becomes quickly till this day the queen of strip (for wealthy audience, as if money equals taste !!!). \n\nThis « pin-ups 2 » belongs to the bad Andrew Blake&apos;s movies. With this director, it&apos;s simple : either it&apos;s good and hot, either it&apos;s awful and not erotic. Usually, it&apos;s rather awful because it&apos;s all for visual, with no story, no dialogues and an annoying ethereal music. So, this one is from the latter : the wardrobe, hairs, sets are awful, too much like a doll house. The action is as flat as the horizon and the constant editing of having two scenes at the same time just give headaches after a few minutes. Worst, even Anita isn&apos;t hot : just two scenes are average (the bondage trio and the last one).",

All of these films star Graciela Borges, and so does _El infierno tan temido_.\n\nBased on one of Juan Carlos Onetti&apos;s best short stories, _El infierno tan temido_ revolves around Juan Risso (Alberto de Mendoza), a journalist who one day begins to receive envelopes containing Polaroid pictures of an erotic nature. The film chronicles his involvement with Gracia César (Graciela Borges), an actress, whom Risso first sees in the garb of Lady Macbeth, of all characters. The action is interspersed with a conversation in a café: seven colleagues discuss their co-worker Risso and relate past events that tied them together. The viewer is thus given a portrait of the main character through action and commentary.\n\nLike other masterpieces of Argentinean cinema such as _Breve cielo_ (David José Kohon, 1969) and _Sur_ (Fernando &quot;Pino&quot; Solanas, 1988), _El infierno tan temido_ features the unforgettable music of Astor Piazzola. Tango is the perfect type of music for this melancholy, deeply emotional film.\n\nFew writers explored the darkness of the human heart like Onetti. _El infierno tan temido_ is an excellent adaptation/expansion of his text. The pace of the film is a little bit slow compared to that of the short story, but the performances, the mise-en-scène, and the music keep the viewer engaged.",

Cary Grant and Tony Curtis shine amongst a wonderful supporting cast in this fictional story inspired by an actual incident that occurred during WWII.  So many war movies are depressing, while others are completely ridiculous.  This film, while full of sexual innuendo and lighthearted humor, still manages to keep it&apos;s humanity, with one foot planted firmly in the reality of the Pacific theater.\n\nA jaunty tale of an injured sub, a few army nurses, a group of lonely sailors, and some pink paint. The direction is above par for the time period and genre, the writing is bright and witty, even for today&apos;s standards, and the performances are thoroughly entertaining.  \n\nThis is a recommended must-see for fans of Curtis and Grant. Grab the popcorn and soda and enjoy!  I give this charming 1959 classic a 7 out of 10."

Everyone seems to concede that the young Debbie Reynolds was talented and spunky, but because of her girl-next-door persona, few seem to recognize that she had more genuine beauty and sex appeal than many overtly &quot;sultry&quot; or &quot;sexy&quot; actresses of her era -- or, indeed, of any era. The rest of the cast is quite adequate but it&apos;s Debbie who makes this movie a lot of fun to watch.",

When she meets Pierre (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing) in a night-club, she finds that he loves jazz and she believes he is her prince charming. But when Pierre sees Alice&apos;s sister Hélène (Marine Delterme), they immediately fall in love with each other and marry each other. \n\nYears later, Alice is a spinster that administrates the pharmacy that belonged to her father (Michel Aumont) and believes that movies can heal many diseases. However her father insistently tries to find a husband for her. When the alarm technician Victor (Patrick Bruel) meets Alice, she does not see any future relationship with him. But one day, Victor brings Alice to meet Woody Allen in Paris and the director gives an advice to Alice.\n\n&quot;Paris-Manhattan&quot; is a delightful French comedy and certainly cult for any fan of Woody Allen. Like the lead actress, I have watched all the movies of Woody Allen and my favorite is Manhattan (but fortunately I have never had a conversation alone with him like she does). When I started to watch the movie, I believed that it was a Woody Allen&apos;s film since even the letters in the presentation were very similar to his movies. But when Woody Allen himself appears on the screen, this was the greatest surprise I had. In the end, I loved this great little movie. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Paris-Manhattan&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "If Amelie had not been released prior to Dieu est Grand, this film would not have had the same exposure...\n\nAnd it&apos;s no surprise. The plot is simple though entertaining; a young girl (Tautou) searches for spirituality in religion and love. Having gone through Catholicism, Buddhism, she meets a Jew (Edouard Baer) and falls in love for him and Judaism... Well, I understood it like this, and I don&apos;t think religion plays a great part anyway. It is just a pretext for funny scenes and as a way to show some depth to the character.\n\nParts of the film are extremely funny, revolving around religion (misunderstandings...) and family troubles (Catherine Jacob as the mom is astounding as usual). However the film drags a bit on the conversion to Judaism and loses the edge in the end completely.\n\nAll in all, entertaining, light, but certainly not unforgettable... People who loved Amelie (like myself) will like it for the wonderful Audrey Tautou: she makes the plot ticks by herself. Not to forget Edouard Baer -a renowned and funny TV presenter (he hosts the French Oscar ceremony)- who is charming and credible when he could have overplayed his part easily! My rate: 6-7/10",

This movie is entertaining, easy to watch but has it&apos;s twists.

      "reviewBody": "This Spanish comedy follows actress Pepa whose boyfriend, Iván, has just left her. What follows is a comedy of coincidences and mishaps. Pepa accidentally sets fire to her bed shortly before her friend Candela calls, she is worried because she has just learnt that her boyfriend is a terrorist and fears she will be arrested for harbouring him. Then Carlos, Iván&apos;s son, and his fiancée turn up to look at the flat, which Pepa is planning to rent out; Carlos had no idea of Pepa&apos;s connection to his father till he sees a picture in the flat. Things only escalate as Carlos tries to help Candela with her problem in a way that only serves to get the police to the flat; but not before Carlos&apos;s mother, who was recently released from a psychiatric hospital turns up.\n\nIf you want a realistic story this won&apos;t be for you; just about everything that happens relies on unlikely coincidences. For me this unlikeliness only served to make it funnier. The characters themselves are only slightly exaggerated; one feels that in more normal situations they would be ordinary people. There are plenty of laughs from start to finish; highlights include gazpacho soup that has been laced with sleeping pills, a visit to a lawyer who may be able to help Candela, and a rather different taxi driver. Writer/director Pedro Almodóvar does a fine job successfully takes the comedy to a high level without tipping into silliness. He is aided by a fine cast that includes Carmen Maura, as Pepa; María Barranco as Candela and a young, pre-Hollywood, Antonio Banderas as Carlos. Overall I&apos;d certainly recommend this to fans of farcical comedy; it is very funny.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Spanish with English subtitles.",

This could have become an intense and exciting drama, but unfortunately it is mostly insipid and harmless, with a ridiculous ending, probably because the director couldn&apos;t think of anything better. Perhaps the idea was meant to explore male mentality, judging by the title, but the movie fails in that regard.",

This here is a documentary without re-enactments, no &apos;fakeness&apos;, just the bareness of living surrounded by water. Innocent children, fishermen, happy folk, sad folk, acting out of free will and forced to do what others than themselves want them too. \n\nThis picture Haanstra sketches, made me realize how insignificant and estranged we must seem to the people of past times. Raw and unrelenting as the water is, shaping the daily life of thousands. At the same time we get to see the contrast between the changing and the unchangeable. Forces of nature doing their thing, and the power of men, failing and succeeding (often in that order). \n\nThe Voice of the Water is not so much a film that&apos;s fun to watch - though it most certainly is - but more than that it&apos;s a feeling that you get. This is humanity, this is living, this is life, this is what it means to be living. And the water is our teacher, our guardian, our foe, our companion, it&apos;s own master.\n\nWatch it and enjoy the way Haanstra captures this ancient world, unaware of the ways in which it would change (in only a couple decades too). And that&apos;s what makes this movie work.",

I don&apos;t see how this can be a comedy. Non of these people are appealing. There is too much anger for that. Their problems are serious. Their dysfunctions are terribly unfunny unless getting your young son burnt is hilarious to you. Getting yourself burnt can be lots of hilarity but this is not that. This seems to be a lot closer to Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. I would be interested in treating this Tennessee Williams play as a much darker drama.",

Look past the economic limitations; the suspenseful and imaginative story involves the death of a humanitarian genius whose father (a famous surgeon) and brother (a robotics expert) team up to keep the genius&apos; brain alive in a robot body (well designed by ace effects artist John P. Fulton).  The film&apos;s message concerns the nature of the soul and the role which physical sensations play in making humans act humane.  Other affects by Fulton include one of sci-fi cinema&apos;s best death rays.  All in all, a moving and intelligent movie"

For the occasion, I gave in to an impulse and came home with the DVD in my bags ! This is not normal as I only usually buy DVD&apos;s of films I know and like.\n\nThe &quot;risk&quot; paid off ........ I thoroughly enjoyed the film, of course, I dearly love both of the main actors and am also fairly fond of Shirley Temple ( it&apos;s a change to see her as an adolescent instead of as a small kid ). Although the beginning of the film is a tad slow, the whole outfit soon warms up and of course viewer suspense is maintained by asking oneself when each one of the couple will discover the &quot;terrible&quot; secret of the other. It&apos;s an old and tried formula, but the hard fact is that it WORKS ! The only unpleasant moment is a frighteningly savage dog attack on Mr Cotten - which I wasn&apos;t expecting - and left me momentarily breathless (let&apos;s face it, those big white teeth were impressive !!!). I am happy to have this film as part of my DVD collection and would highly recommend it to all of you who are smitten with 1940&apos;s style romanticism !",

After that, you have to pretend that the primitive animatronic baby is real (at least in the movie).\n\nFinally, don&apos;t pretend to find Oscar&apos;s performances for the actors.\n\nAfter that, enjoy an excellent movie. The plot is good and believable, tha acting is OK, the music score is excellent.\n\nIn my opinion, it deserves a 5.0\n\nMy advice, look for it in your local video rental, and enjoy.",

The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I&apos;m aware of.",

      "reviewBody": "Van Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor did two films together during their tenure at MGM and The Big Hangover is the first of them. He&apos;s a young law school graduate, top of his particular class, who is applying for an opening in a very prestigious white shoe law firm. She&apos;s the daughter of the firm&apos;s senior partner Percy Waram and she&apos;s crushing out big time on Van.\n\nVan&apos;s got one unusual case of shell shock during the war. Two things happened to him, he had a close friend die in his arms in a plane being shot at with anti-aircraft guns and he nearly drowned in a cellar of a monastery that was being used as a hospital. The monks in the place made wine and after spending a good deal of time up to his neck in the stuff, the slightest taste or smell of liquor gets him cockeyed drunk.\n\nIt&apos;s an amusing bit for parties, but not at all social or business occasions. Liz turns amateur psychologist to discover what&apos;s ailing Van. \n\nThe Big Hangover is an amusing comedy from MGM, not hardly in the top ten of films for either of its leads. It does have an interesting subplot involving discrimination and the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws that were being passed by a lot of states at this time, New York among them where the story takes place. A Chinese doctor, Philip Ahn, is being thrown out of an apartment the owner is represented by Percy Waram&apos;s firm. \n\nWhich leads to the highlight of the film and the best performance in the film by Leon Ames who plays the city attorney who is charged with enforcement of the non-discrimination statute. After Johnson chastises him, Ames gives an eloquent statement about how money and success are the gods we cherish. \n\nThe Big Hangover is amusing in spots, is serious in spots, has a bit of trouble making its mind up whether it&apos;s a comedy or a drama of social significance. Still it is entertaining and fans of the two stars should like it.",

Yes it&apos;s a thriller, but it&apos;s way too comical to be a straight up action thriller, the humour is prevelant throughout, it&apos;s a black comedy, and for my money, it&apos;s one of the best of them, some of the situations are outrageous.\n\nIt&apos;s almost a little surreal at times, let&apos;s be clear, this is not based on any real life events, what it is however is thoroughly entertaining. It will make you want to watch the TV series.\n\nI will never tire of hearing the word &apos;Marge,&apos; and if you&apos;re watching for the first time, you&apos;ll hear it a lot, you&apos;ll also hear some curious accents.\n\nVery well acted, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi nailed it for me.\n\nI&apos;d have gone crazy at that lake too!\n\n8/10.",

After the scene is set, it goes back to the beginning of The Beatles and and see many familiar clips of performances of &quot;Twist And Shout&quot;, &quot;From Me To You&quot; and &quot;Help&quot;.\n\nThe most fascinating part of this documentary are rare home movies of John at home and of some news segments probably not seen since they were aired. A striking scene shows where an obsessed fan found his way to John&apos;s England estate. The young man is confused and may be on drugs but believes John&apos;s songs are speaking directly to him, asking him the meaning behind his &quot;I Dig A Pony&quot; song, John tells him it was just playing around with words, literally a nonsense song. John gently tells him the songs should not be mixed up with his own life and offers the guy something to eat.\n\nJohn is gentle when dealing with his fans, but he can have a temper when dealing with technicians in a recording session, or reporters who say they miss &quot;the old Beatles&quot;. It sure is intriguing stuff for any Beatles fan and definitely worth your time.",

      "reviewBody": "In Colorado, the lonely Milton (Nicolas Cage) hunts down a gang of worshipers of a satanic cult trying to find where their leader Jonah King (Billy Burke) is. King has killed Milton&apos;s daughter and abducted her baby to sacrifice him at midnight of a full moon in Stillwater and Milton wants to rescue his granddaughter. \n\nMilton reaches Oklahoma and finds that Stillwater is a deactivated prison in Louisiana. Then he helps the waitress Piper (Amber Heard) first with her damaged car and then he protects her against her brutal boyfriend. In return, she gives a ride to him to Louisianna. Soon they discover that a mysterious stranger called The Accountant (William Fichtner) is chasing them. What is the secret of Milton and The Accountant? \n\n&quot;Drive Angry&quot; is a brainless, but also a highly entertaining movie with the trash story of a man that escapes from hell to save his granddaughter and is hunted by the reaper. There is non-stop action and havoc, with car chases; shootings; and the hot Amber Heard. The cast has Nicolas Cage, William Fichtner in a parody of the role of Alex Mahone in &quot;Prison Break&quot; and David Morse. My suggestion is to shutdown your brain and to enjoy this funny movie. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Fúria Sobre Rodas&quot; (&quot;Rage over Wheels&quot;)\n\nNote: On 19 June 2015, I saw this movie again.",

My wife and I were just saying every step that was going to happen before it even happened. From the beginning of the movie, when the kids lost their parents in an accident, you already wished they were also killed in that accident. During the whole movie I was secretly hoping Jason Voorhees would appear and kill them all. Seriously this is an abomination of a movie. I still don&apos;t get why I watched it...",

If you don&apos;t have other expectations the film is decent and watchable, the acting is good, the production is good. Sure, the plot is predictable but it&apos;s a vampire movie! How unpredictable does the genre get? I wasn&apos;t looking for originality or innovation here, just a good movie to watch, and this was.\n\nWhen Lukas Moodysson directs a Swedish vampire movie, then you can expect some originality, some twists and turns, some things that you wouldn&apos;t think could ever be in that type of movie. Until then, pass the popcorn and enjoy Frostbiten for what it is.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of blood and gore, but it isn&apos;t shocking, just the usual vampire bites. No nudity to speak of, but hey, you can&apos;t have everything. There is some drug usage, but it&apos;s a plot device, not gratuitous. Fairly tame for a horror movie, really.",

      "reviewBody": "I rented this film cold at the video store -- and was very pleasantly surprised with a very well done movie. If you don&apos;t know anything else about Gattaca, the less you know, the better. Stop reading this review right now, go watch it, and come back when you&apos;re done!\n\nIt was after my first viewing of the film that several little details dawned on me:\n\n1) The term &quot;borrowed ladder&quot; is a utterly-brilliantly-conceived bit of future slang that carries a *double meaning*. I&apos;m still amazed that the producers didn&apos;t make more of this. Instead, they were content to leave this gem to be discovered by the thinking and missed by the vast masses. I was very definitely impressed. \n\n2) As I was explaining the film to my wife, it occurred to me in mid-explanation that this is really a film that has to do with what is properly called =eugenics=; one of the things the Nazis were about. Then my mind wandered to word etymologies: I recalled that the name &quot;Eugene&quot; = &quot;well born.&quot; And then I realized...\n\n!!!\n\n3) It&apos;s interesting the extent to which so many of the characters in the film *didn&apos;t* live up to their genetic destiny, one way or another.\n\n4) Because I hadn&apos;t seen any previews, I had no immediate reference for where the name &quot;Gattaca&quot; had come from. And then I suddenly realized...\n\n!!!\n\n5) It wasn&apos;t until I watched the movie the second time that I caught the effects with the title sequence letters...\n\nNow I had figured out by this time that there were likely to be other intriguing little details I&apos;ve missed, so I was fascinated to read from another reviewer here about the boy Vincent falling with a toy rocket in his hand. \n\nI wonder what else is in there?\n\nAll in all, this is a very well written, tightly woven movie. Seen cold, with no real prior knowledge of the film, it came off as a tremendous science-fiction SUSPENSE THRILLER. There were several scenes that just had me climbing the walls with tension. Fabulous job!\n\nAnd I&apos;m not the only one who thinks so. When my WIFE says she wants to see a SCIENCE FICTION movie for the SECOND TIME... well, I don&apos;t think THAT has EVER happened before!"

Hopefully this will be remastered for DVD someday and include extra moments from this 1976 Seattle show, such as Ringo Starr greeting Paul on stage after the encore.\n\nMy videotape leaves  out several songs present on the complete Wings Over America cd.  This is odd because there is a trailer at the end of the tape that includes &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; which was cut from the 1981 Thorn/EMI release, which I believe is the last commercial release of this video. A few years ago VH-1 aired the show in its entirety the week &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; was released. Sir Paul has gone back and remastered a few Wings cds in the new 5 channel stereo format, so hopefully this will finally become available again.  In the meantime, try to find the double cd &quot;Wings Over America,&quot; which is also out of print but not hard to find."

      "reviewBody": "SPOILERS Out of the cinematic versions of Emily Bronte&apos;s incredible tale, this 1939 version is one of the furthest from it. However, as a piece of cinematic art, it is the finest, a shining example of Hollywood craftmanship made at a time when so many classic movies were being churned out. Producer Sam Goldwyn said it was the best movie he ever made. It&apos;s certainly director William Wyler&apos;s best film, and that includes Ben Hur. While Bronte&apos;s novel is a lot more than just a love story, this almost reduces it to being just a love story. Never mind, because as a love story, this film works wonderfully. Like almost all great love stories, it&apos;s gloriously romantic, emotionally intense and ultimately incredibly moving. \n\nThe controversial decision to miss out almost the entire second half of the book allowed the filmmakers to concentrate on the Heathcliff/Cathy love story, and Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon both have incredible chemistry and strengh in their performances. No, they are not Bronte&apos;s characters, especially the film&apos;s version of Heathcliff, who here is FAR too nice, but are definitely one of the greatest of Hollywood&apos;s cinematic couples. This is especially notable in the scenes set on the moors, where we are definitely in that Olde Hollywood romantic never never land where the music soars and passion had to be, and was, encapsulated in a kiss. Olivier is impressive delivering some of Bronte&apos;s lines, of which there are a surprising amount, and the film does follow the book&apos;s plot very closely, it just tones down the darkness.\n\nThere are many superbly done sequences- the incredibly atmospheric opening where a traveller arrives at Heathcliff&apos;s house, all the scenes on the moors, Cathy&apos;s speech to Nelly &quot;I AM Heathcliff&quot;, and of course, more than any other scene, the death of Cathy. As Heathcliff takes the dying Cathy to the window to see the moors once more and she finally dies virtually standing up, all the while while Alfred Newman&apos;s love theme plays and plays. This is one of the moving and also one of the most beautiful and artistic deaths in Hollywood history, all the more powerful for actually being comparatively understated by Hollywood standards of the time. Only those who had read the book or knew of the missing second half would know there was more in the story to come, in the context of the film the tale seems complete. Some don&apos;t like the final scene of Heathcliff and Cathy&apos;s ghosts wondering in the snow, but it is actually closer to the book&apos;s actual ending than most seem to admit. It&apos;s also one of the best tearjerkers ever, period.\n\nMost people read the book and are than disappointed when they see this. It&apos;s therefore best to see this first, and to appreciate it as one of the great Hollywood love stories, before THAN reading the book. Yes, the book is still better, but than most books are."

It revealed a hidden part of Israeli cinema, with a lot of &apos;moving&apos; images predating the creation of the country in 1948, and many movies having nothing to do with the country&apos;s wars and conflicts. I came out of it with a craving for more, David Perlov&apos;s Diary for instance. Nadjari artfully managed to negotiate its way between common obstacles when it comes to Israel, I mean the self-flagellation or soothing discourses. Also I very much appreciated the comments on movie excerpts made by experienced Israeli academics: Israeli cinema has a prehistory and a history in its own right.",

Extremely average plot. So much so that it feels like Chat GPT wrote it in 30 seconds. The acting is so incredibly bland it honestly feels like a student film with a decent budget. The progressive car commercials are more engaging with their acting and that&apos;s saying something. There isn&apos;t a single character in this movie you&apos;re rooting for or care about and the motive of the film is so mundane and ridiculous you wonder if they came up with it like a school assignment you procrastinated with and wrote it the night before.\n\nVery boring 5/10.",

Most people expect to see an average Hollywood version of a cop movie and they will be very disappointed when seeing this one. No, it isn&apos;t about the good cop chasing the bad guys, making a beautiful little hole in the forehead of everyone that doesn&apos;t obey the law. This movie is much more subtle and probably a lot harder to understand for a lot of people.\n\nIn fact, the whole movie is created around only three actors. But not just three actors, we are talking about Chris Penn, Tim Roth and Michael Rooker, who all did an excellent job. Trust me, never have I been more fascinated by three men in a darkened room, pushing each other to their mental and physical limits.\n\nThis is how the story goes: A prostitute has been murdered and there is one suspect. He&apos;s an extremely intelligent, epileptic alcoholic who is able to deceive everybody, even the polygraph. His investigators try to make him confess the murder by playing little mind games, only to see that he outsmarts them time after time.\n\nThe dialogs are fascinating, the use of flashbacks very interesting. Add some tense interrogation scenes with a lot of psychological war fare and a huge plot twist at the end of the movie and you know you have something special. I guess those psychological games will not be understood by everybody, but you&apos;ll love it if you are intelligent enough to understand them. I know I did and I give this movie an 8/10.",

Very few people have watched this film has it had received its share of insults and bashing.\n\nHowever, I recommend to any one who loved either or both &apos;The Ring&apos; (American adaption) or &apos;Ringu&apos; (Original Japanese version) to watch this version. You owe it to yourself.\n\nI won&apos;t lie to you, the acting is poor and the actress who plays Sun-joo is so wooden it&apos;s frightening. Most of the scenes are dull and strange... But the scenes with Eun-Suh are handled beautifully. I watched this movie several times... And it really grew on me.\n\nIts nothing compared to &apos;Ringu&apos;, but like I said, it&apos;s worth a look.\n\n2/5 *** Stars",

It&apos;s tempting to try an relate it to Nazi ideology.\n\nIt is both a berg film with a brief roping down the mountain scene and a montage of music to go with clouds squashed with an anamorphic lens. It&apos;s also a heimatfilm, kicking off with Hatheyer and her dad Köck in Tyrolean costume reaping against a mountain peak back ground and rolling on through folklorico inn, funeral and festival scenes. This is not all that interesting but the story is worse. No one generates much sympathy. \n\nAdd in some odd developments. No one is disturbed about killing the vulture to steal it&apos;s chick and Hatheyer&apos;s romantic idol, a middle aged Rist mocks her as the Vulture Girl while her also over aged suitor Esterle goes about beating people with lumps of wood. Her dad also takes the stick to Heidemarie when she scorns Esterle, his choice of husband. She is banished to a solitary existence in a mountain hut accompanied only by the tamed vulture. The bird however comes in useful, tapping Lassie style on mountaineer von Schlettow&apos;s window to alert him to her lying in the snow.\n\nHatheyer becomes head of the house, in her turn a mean authority figure denigrating believed rival Markus. Then Heidemarie puts on her big fur hat and it&apos;s on again off again with Rist.\n\nHatheyer in heavy lip gloss is a presentable if rather stocky lead. Director Harlan is able to muster the heavy weight film making talent effectively but not able to present a compelling drama for them to deliver."

Igor is compared to a crane that has lost the support of its parents, as indeed Igor&apos;s father has lost the support of his employer and his mother has not exactly landed in a pot of jam either. There is not a lot of wildlife photography, but the human story, proceeding almost but not exactly along expectable lines, works all right.",

      "reviewBody": "Flightplan is billed as a psychological thriller, and director Robert Schwentke almost succeeds in bringing us just this. Schwentke had all the major ingredients to create something that would be a cut above the standard fair that is increasingly force-fed to an already bloated public. Jodie Foster, plays the recently bereaved Kyle Pratt, who accompanied by her young daughter Julia, (Martine Lawston) is flying back to New York with the body of her husband. So far so good, you might say. Foster is a fine actress who does not disappoint in her portrayal as a woman who is forced to question her own sanity when the disappearance of her daughter is met with a collective, &apos;what daughter?&apos; response from the passengers and crew.\n\nThis response to the missing child sets the stage for what Schwentke hopes will be a tense, claustrophobic, and frantic thriller, dramatically powered by the psychological meltdown of Foster&apos;s emotionally fraught Pratt. Unfortunately, this is not quite what the finished product turns out to be. Foster&apos;s performance is all that it should be (there are similarities with the role she played so well in The Panic Room), as is that of Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Air Marshall Carson. What happens then is a film that shows early promise - Schwentke initially establishes a grave, disturbed tone - descends into absurdity due to a plot which demands a level of credulousness that defies all reason.\n\nThe sheer stupidity of the plot - &apos;the holes are big enough to fly a jumbo jet through&apos;, according to one critic - not only undoes the hard work invested in the early part of the film, it ruins it completely. Peter Dowling&apos;s original script would have worked so much better. This involved the slightly more believable scenario of an aviation security agent being forced to participate in a straightforward hijack. Post 9/11, there remains a great deal of residual fear and paranoia surrounding air travel. Sadly, Schwentke has failed to exploit this in Flightplan. There is an attempt to address the issue of perceived Arab terrorism in the film but it seems clumsy and patronising.\n\nThere are a few nice touches in the film - the passengers&apos; unease at take off is shown well - but overall, viewers are forced to question the feasibility of the events taking place. Too many questions arise, such as why does Jodie Foster sound as though she is strolling along a wooden stage, in high heels? This is a minor point however, the major one being - and this is central to the plot - how can a plane full of passengers (and crew) not notice a six year old child? Or to put this another way, is it possible for a six year old to remain unnoticed on a plane? I don&apos;t think so Schwentke, as much as I would love this to be the case."

      "reviewBody": "In the 1970&apos;s and 80&apos;s, Kim Jong-il, son of North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Il-Sung, led the DPRK&apos;s film industry. He picked the subjects and led the productions personally. &quot;Kotpanum chonio&quot; (The Flower Girl, 1972) is often viewed to be the country&apos;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, though it too is made to serve the national Juche ideology. This was the only North Korean film to win a prize outside the country, and it was an audience hit in many Asian countries. The film is said to be based on a play by the leader Kim Il-Sung himself, no less.\n\nSet during the Japanese occupation, &quot;The Flower Girl&quot; tells the story of Kotpun, a young girl who is forced to sell flowers in order to make enough money to buy medicine for her sick mother. She also has to take care of her younger sister, which is not easy in a country run by the brutal Japanese imperial forces. The film is a melodrama, though in the usual North Korean fashion, every now and then we get a song that describes the plot to us, though it really needn&apos;t. This is part of the reason why the film feels slow and goes on for two hours. Halfway through, we find out about the existence of a spoken-word narrator, which is just bad film-making.\n\nDPRK cinema is a hobby of mine. I have seen about 50 films from North Korea. Though it is enormously beloved in its home country, &quot;The Flower Girl&quot; is not one of their best, at least in my opinion. It is less straightforward in its propaganda, which is good, but the film-makers should have toned down the melodramatic elements. The film is loud, and there is crying in nearly every scene. The plot is not half bad, and for once the nationalist flavor of a DPRK production stems from actually showing, how bad things used to be for the poor people. This could be a good film, had it been made better.\n\nFor me, &quot;The Flower Girl&quot; is more comedic than it is moving. It tries to make every scene into a climax by always picking the plot continuation, that has the biggest emotional impact. That&apos;s not how good movies work and it also makes the film very predictable for anyone who loves to watch better melodramas, like I do.\n\n&quot;The Flower Girl&quot; is a good introduction to DPRK film industry. It is an interesting curiosity, but not a classic of world cinema.",

To those who judged this harshly: You can go back to watching Transformers; you&apos;re in the wrong theater. Such people should be tied to the back side of a Bantha with tummy problems. ;D\n\nOkay, on to the serious review: Who doesn&apos;t recognize the term &quot;Gort, Klaatu barada nicto&quot;? This film set the bar for so many films to come, in an age when monsters were a guy in a gorilla suit and a space helmet, giant ants were terrorizing a city, and another guy in a rubber suit was stomping on a miniature Tokyo. Among that, we suddenly find a movie with actual meaning, a moral, a great plot and story-line, decent acting, an honest-to-goodness valid warning-- and one of the best robot presentations EVER.\n\nWas it perfect? No. I don&apos;t know as I&apos;ve ever seen a perfect film. Were there flaws? Sure. What do people expect? It&apos;s the overall cinematic presentation that is the thing here-- the experience of a movie capturing the audience and making them say, &quot;Wow&quot;. Relatively few films have accomplished that over the decades. This film did.\n\nThe special effects for that day were superb. The modern-day remake didn&apos;t come close to the quality of this 1951 film. The story has stood the test of time and is even more applicable today that it was back then (only now we can add the destruction of our own world to the mix).\n\nThis movie is as close to pristine as a movie can get (for that day) , and proudly takes its place among non-sci-fi classics-- and even sci fi classics that came later. Had the HUGO awards existed in &apos;51 I have no doubt this film would have taken top slot.",

In &quot;My Week With Marilyn&quot; Michelle Williams is full of light, the real light, the internal one, while everyone else is deadly opaque. The film feels like a very low budget TV movie and not even the grand manors and colleges manage to give it the production value, the story deserved. But Michelle Williams is truly enchanting. Not that she is a dead ringer for the real Marilyn. So much more demure, smaller breasts, smaller behind, only her strange kind of melancholia seems to match the original one and some of that magic essence appears to be in place. Eddie Redmayne, the narrator, whose POV drives the story is rather a cool fish. His grasp is so limp and small that I was kept longing for more. Kenneth Brannagh is very funny and Judi Dench, terrific, but Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh is just so wrong one wants to fast-forward, unfortunately, that&apos;s impossible right now. But, let&apos;s go back to Michelle Williams, the one reason to see this film and in itself she&apos;s reason enough.",

      "reviewBody": "Take Me Home Tonight was much better then I thought it was going to be, now don&apos;t get me wrong, from seeing the trailers I wanted to see this film and was excited to. The film itself has much the same feel as Superbad, two friends on an epic one night quest and one focusing on &quot;the girl&quot;. The film has a great, tight script that stays focused throughout. Topher Grace gives an awesome performance, I really enjoy him as an actor and think he&apos;s kind of overlooked. Dan Fogler also gives an awesome performance as the crazy friend. This also has a good amount of heart, especially right when it needs, Anna Faris and Topher Grace give great performances as twins, and the ending won&apos;t disappoint, it leaves a very John Hughes feeling at the end, which I think is what they were going for. Now the reason I gave the film an 8 is because it&apos;s not an instant classic, for instance American Gangster or The Departed gets a 10/10 for me. Also you might think from the commercials that this is going to be a parody of the 80&apos;s. Yeah, everyone wears their crazy 80&apos;s clothes and there&apos;s ton&apos;s of 80&apos;s references and a kick ass soundtrack, however if 5 years from now someone were to sit down and not know when the film was released and not recognize any of the actors as being from the late 90&apos;s/00&apos;s they would definitely think that this was made in the 80&apos;s. If they had tried to make this a parody of the 80&apos;s it would have been terrible, it would have had more of Wedding Singer feel to it, and I&apos;m glad that that&apos;s not what they went for. The fact that it&apos;s set in the 80&apos;s and everyone is wearing the cloths and their hair like that, it&apos;s almost more like a they&apos;re saying &quot;this is how people dressed&quot;, not &quot;THIS, is how people dressed&quot;, that said this was a pretty good movie, if you enjoyed any 80&apos;s movie made by John Hughes and more recent films like Superbad, you&apos;ll really enjoy &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Kurdish Persian director Bahman Ghobadi scores again at San Sebastian with the Kurdish language film &quot;Half Moon&quot;\n\nBy Alex Deleon image1.jpeg Basic Plot: Mamo, an old and legendary Kurdish musician living in Iran, plans to give one final concert over the border in Iraqi Kurdistan. Rounding up his ten sons, he sets out for the long arduous journey in a derelict bus while plagued by a recurrent vision of his own death at half moon. \n\nBahman Ghobadi&apos;s new Iranian-Kurdish offering, &quot;Half Moon&quot; (Niwemang) was in competition at the 2006 San Sebastian Film Festival. Ghobadi is a favored son here in Donostia where his last film &quot;Turtles Can Fly&quot; was unanimously awarded the Best Film Golden Concha two years ago. The current work, with a lengthy running time of just under two hours, again focuses on the stateless Kurdish community of Iran, and is rich in Kurdish cultural and folkloric material with the usual sparkling, natural performances he invariably draws from his predominantly Kurdish performers, and the huge panoramic landscapes of the barren mountainous Persian terrain which have come to typify his visual style. \n\n&quot;Half Moon&quot; might be characterized as a road movie in which a group of traditional Kurdish musicians consisting of Maestro Mamo and his ten sons, set out in a school bus from Tehran for the border area where Iran abuts against both Turkey and Iraq, hoping to stage a musical event with traditional instruments for their Kurdish brethren over the border in Iraq -- now a possibility thanks to the recent fall of the Saddam Hussein regime. At the border they run into unpleasant military confrontations with near disastrous results for their treasured project. Mamo, (Ismail Ghaffari) the handsome old man who is the leader of the delegation, is so distraught that he gets into the coffin where the Kurdish instruments have been concealed and asks to be buried alive. At the touchy border crossing they are met by a beautiful mysterious young woman who offers her assistance in getting them past the ominous border guards.\n\n&quot;Half Moon&quot; , while dealing with the precarious position of Kurds in this strife torn part of the world, is much lighter in tone than his previous &quot;Turtles Can Fly&quot; and is almost a comedy, but with serious political overtones. The beauty at the border is played by Golshifte Farahani. currently Iran&apos;s most popular leading lady of the silver screen. With her looks and on screen charisma its not hard to see why. She reminds me of a cross between Italy&apos;s Monica Belluci and Pakistan&apos;s former president Benazir Bhutto. With Iran&apos;s growing presence on the world film scene it seems to be only a matter of time before this striking actress is discovered by some Western director and breaks out into an international career. Golshifte was present at the press conference and speaks fluent English, so that language would be no hindrance. But if Hollywood gets their hands on her they&apos;ll probably change her name to something that sounds less shifty and easier to remember.\n\nPS: Golshifte later had to leave Iran after defying the clerics and has indeed broken out into an international career, without changing her name, notably in films by director Ridley Scott. Unfortunately not yet in the kind of leading roles that would properly showcase the talents and beauty of this remarkable Iranian actress, now 33. In January 2012, it was reported that Golshifteh would not be welcome back in Iran after posing nude in a French magazine. Britain&apos;s Daily Telegraph reported that government officials told Golshifteh that &quot;Iran does not need actors or artists like you. You may offer your artistic services somewhere else&quot;. This she continues to do while having taken up residence in France. Director Ghobadi has also been forced into exile after his underground film &quot;Nobody Knows About Persian Cats&quot; was viewed as subversive by the reigning powers in 2009. ------------------------------------------------------",

      "reviewBody": "This is the first sci-fi movie to be produced in Costa Rica. As such, there are clear elements of low-budget set and prop construction but they are not so blatant as to distract from the experience.\n\nIt was an enjoyable movie although convoluted. The timeline jumped back and forth with flashbacks within flashbacks that didn&apos;t even seem important, but if you focus on the main timeline it works for the most part. However, it tried to include too many sci-fi premises at the same time (earth extinction threat, post-apocalyptic earth, sentient AI, space, man vs. Machine, science gone too far) that kept it from fully developing and grounding any of them. In that regard, don&apos;t trust the trailer. It isn&apos;t a &quot;last man on earth trying to survive and rejoin his family in space&quot; type of movie.\n\nIt had some moving scenes with commendable acting that were ineffective because the stakes weren&apos;t clear. They spoke of inevitable actions and consequences, meanwhile the audience was never let in on what the threat was at that moment. The perceived &quot;threat&quot; was constantly changing as the movie progressed (re: too many sci-fi premises at once).\n\nIt emulated mainstream sci-fi stories so don&apos;t go into it expecting a special LATAM twist or messaging within it, it just happens to have Costa Ricans living through the events with presumably the whole world going through the same experience. This isn&apos;t a point against nor in favor, just an aspect to consider.\n\nOverall, it did surpass my expectations and I was immersed in the experience. At its core I believe the theme was that humanity is generally selfish in its quest to self-preservation but the effort of those who aren&apos;t can be enough to turn that around. Experience it as a whole and don&apos;t get hung up on the details because most of them won&apos;t matter, nor are they addressed, by the end.",

They focus mainly on character development, character interaction and the bond that develops during these manliest of adventures. Now, given this, what better combination of people is there than a nun and a cowboy? You&apos;re right! There isn&apos;t any!\n\nNow just because the leading lady is a nun, don&apos;t think there isn&apos;t any sexual tension. It&apos;s sexual tensions abound! Not only that but it&apos;s a fun, well-made movie. Shirley MacLaine was great and, lets face it, Clint Eastwood was born to make westerns. Well, maybe not &quot;make&quot; them ... but he&apos;s a great cowboy. Well directed, well paced, good story, good acting and it stars a nun and a cowboy. The opening music didn&apos;t &quot;do it&quot; for me but even that would probably grow on me. I fully endorse this movie. Look for &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot; T-shirts with myself in the background giving the thumbs-up.",

The story is cute, the drawings are more fully- rendered than they would be in a genuine Leica reel so they are nice to see, but &quot;innovative&quot;? I don&apos;t think so.\n\nThe Goofy &quot;How-to&quot; sequence is okay (I never cared for the &quot;How-To&quot; series, but I know a similarly-themed version in &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; with Goofy trying to be a Gaucho is funnier).\n\nThe title short - &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; - is cute and funny. I don&apos;t think it rates as a classic, but because it is such a rarely-viewed piece it needs to be watched by all Disney-philes.\n\nConsidering its historic value, this movie is hardly a waste of time. It&apos;s just not one that deserves repeated viewings."

      "reviewBody": "I only recently got to see this movie and  on the basis of the all-start cast and the still pictures that I had seen  I was expecting a well-made and slightly offbeat war film. I was very disappointed. This movie can&apos;t make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy or an action / adventure yarn, and in the end it largely fails to deliver on either front. Roger Moore is hopelessly miscast as the antiques-loving German (or rather Austrian) PoW camp commandant, and a number of the other characters such as Sonny Bono&apos;s Italian chef, Michael Sheard&apos;s oafish German sergeant and Telly Savalas&apos; Greek resistance leader are extremely caricature-ish. Even Richard Rowntree&apos;s PoW character comes across merely as Shaft in a GI uniform (coming out with expressions like `he&apos;s one cool cat&apos;). The character Charlie (played by Elliot Gould) is a civilian USO entertainer whose plane was shot down over the Mediterranean, with him and his female colleague being captured and placed in the PoW camp. However, when these two are introduced early on, we see them looking like a pair of well-heeled American holidaymakers. Both are immaculately groomed and dressed, and they certainly don&apos;t look like two people who have just been fished out of the Mediterranean after their plane has been shot out of the sky - the woman is even lugging all her suitcases behind her!!! I assume that we&apos;re supposed to believe that they too would have survived the shootdown without even a scuff mark and then floated up from the plane wreckage to be conveniently retrieved. I have to admit that initially I found the Charlie character fairly amusing and even laughed at some of his one-liners. But ultimately he became more annoying than funny. The action scenes later on were also fairly predictable and boring. I got the impression that the makers of this movie were trying to combine elements from those classic war films `The Guns Of Navarone&apos;, `The Great Escape&apos; and `Kelly&apos;s Heroes&apos; (we even had David Niven who appeared in the former and Telly Savalas from the latter). But this movie is not a classic in any way, shape or form. It oozes mediocrity in all areas. On the plus side, the Greek islands location is wonderful and the camera work is on the whole pretty good. And the beautiful Claudia Cardinale graces any movie that she&apos;s in. On balance though I&apos;d have to give this film just 3½ out of 10. Not the worst war film I&apos;ve ever seen, but definitely `below average&apos; and  given the amount of big names in it  the end result is a massive disappointment.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d heard nothing but bad things about this film; but decided to track it down anyway simply because it has so much promise. For a start it was directed by Brian Yuzna&apos; part of the creative genius behind Re-Animator and director of horror masterpieces Society and Return of the Living Dead 3; and secondly, the plot; which is based on a book by Matthew Costello, sounded like a great base for a horror movie. I figured that with these two elements in place, things couldn&apos;t possibly be as bad as I&apos;d heard. Well...to say things went wrong would be an understatement. The plot focuses on a Spanish village named Marienbad; a place where the locals are gradually succumbing to a Satanic cult lead by a man named Mordecai Salas. Someone or other has hatched a plan involving building a dam to flood the town and it&apos;s inhabitants; but the plan fails when a couple of no good kids end up freeing the cult leader before the town is engulfed in water. Fast forward forty years and the village of Desbaria stands in its place; though the cult leader is waiting for his revenge.\n\nThe film gets off to a really good start as we watch a couple of kids traverse across a flooded town and into a brilliantly realised Satanic church where they are greeted by a group of bewitched locals. But once this is over and we move into the present day, things start to go downhill. The main problem with the film is that it&apos;s a mess. There are a handful of good ideas but they haven&apos;t been put together coherently which takes most of the credibility away from the film. The film also feels very cheap; the poor acting doesn&apos;t help in this respect, and neither does the turgid script which is littered with trite lines of dialogue. The film does feature some nice locations, which is nice, but that&apos;s really the only good thing I have to say about it. Anyone who has seen more than a few Brian Yuzna films will know that the director likes to let things descend into chaos so he can show a wave of graphic images; and that happens here, but it&apos;s not as good as it was in the likes of Society and really just caps off a very disappointing effort. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to name this as Yuzna&apos;s worst alongside Faust: Love of the Damned, and only hardcore fans need apply.",

      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with an all-female pop group known as &quot;Momoiro Clover&quot; agreeing to appear in a documentary that requires them to visit to a haunted building in exchange for an opportunity to perform at an extremely well-known Japanese music show. Just prior to heading out, however, they are told that a specific ghost by the name of &quot;Shirome&quot; resides in this building and that it has the power to grant wishes to those who dare to petition him. The problem is that the person making the wish has to have a pure motive--otherwise their soul will be immediately sent to hell. In addition to that, the girls in the band are then informed that several people have recently died in this building as a result. And to make matters even more stressful for them, the group is then lectured by several authorities in the occult--to the point that they quickly become terrified about actually entering the building. Yet having said all of that, the girls are all determined to appear on this special musical show and they set out on their journey. What they don&apos;t realize, however, is that there is one person among them who is not only aware that the whole setup is a farce--but she has also agreed with those making the documentary--to secretly build up her colleague&apos;s stress levels in order to make a more successful final product. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, from what I understand, all of the members of the band were totally unaware that they were being setup, and as a result their reactions were quite genuine. That&apos;s the good part. The bad part is that, aside from the terror these young girls were subjected to, the director&apos;s by-the-numbers approach greatly limited the overall effect. So, there really wasn&apos;t much horror or suspense to be found here. That being said, while I don&apos;t consider this to be bad film necessarily, it wasn&apos;t something that really captured my attention either, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",

Stewart Granger actually makes a good hero - though starting to age, he has both a charm and a heroic presence that fits this particular &quot;Hand&quot; hero he plays. Other than that, it&apos;s more of the same - nice scenery, but bogged down by a leaden pace, blatant padding (especially toward the end) plus comic relief that&apos;s both utterly unfunny and childish. There is some interest in seeing a young Terence Hill, several years before he became a European superstar, and there is some amusement to see HIM being the one slapped and punched around for a change!"

      "reviewBody": "Knowing that MADAME ROSA had triumphed at the Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category when in direct competition with Luis Bunuel&apos;s superb swan song THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE had always made me want to check it out. As had been the case the previous year with BLACK AND WHITE IN COLOR and COUSIN, COUSINE, two movies shot in French found themselves among the final five nominees for the same award since, in this case, OBJECT was submitted as Spain&apos;s official entry for consideration!; for the record, the other nominees that year were A SPECIAL DAY (Italy), IPHIGENIA (Greece) and OPERATION THUNDERBOLT (Israel; which I will be catching up with presently given my ongoing Oscar-themed marathon). \n\nAs far as I am aware, there had only been a solitary Italian TV screening of MADAME ROSA over the years but no home video release in my neck of the woods; eventually I came across it by chance fairly recently via a hazy &apos;full movie&apos; video on &quot;You Tube&quot; – presumably culled from a Hen&apos;s Tooth NTSC VHS – which occasionally also suffers from white subtitles against a white background but, thanks to my grasp of the French language, that liability did not pose too much of a problem. Egyptian-born Israeli director Mizrahi had previously been among the Oscar nominees for both I LOVE YOU, ROSA (1972) and THE HOUSE ON CHELOUCHE STREET (1973) where it had deservedly lost out to another Bunuel effort, namely THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, and Francois Truffaut&apos;s DAY FOR NIGHT respectively; while the film under review remains his best-known work, he has at least three other entries of interest in his filmography: I SENT A LETTER TO MY LOVE (1980; with Simone Signoret, Jean Rochefort and Delphine Seyrig), LA VIE CONTINUE (1981; with Annie Girardot and Jean-Pierre Cassel) and EVERY TIME WE SAY GOODBYE (1986; with Tom Hanks and Christina Marsillach) – only the first of these, however, is available to me at this point. \n\nAlthough the film&apos;s original French title literally translates to &quot;The Life Ahead Of Him&quot; and applies to the character of a troubled Arab teenager named Mohammed but affectionately known as Momo&apos; (a quietly impressive Samy Ben-Youb – who, at one point, callously sells off an amiable mutt he had just acquired for 500 francswhich he then proceeds to throw down the sewer through a street grating!), it is understandable that internationally it was retitled as MADAME ROSA since Simone Signoret&apos;s moving central characterization of an overweight, moribund former Jewess prostitute-turned-&quot;wet nurse&quot; to the brood of whores dominates the entire movie; interestingly enough, she had already portrayed a whore-with-a-heart-of-gold in Luis Bunuel&apos;s DEATH IN THE GARDEN (1956). While at the very start of the film (adapted from Romain Gary&apos;s novel) Madame Rosa is shown caring for a dozen kids spawned by working streetwalkers, by the end of it only two remain – the others having been in the meantime &apos;adopted&apos; by families of their respective nationality and creed that have likewise emigrated to the Parisian &apos;red light&apos; district of Pigalle. Indeed, one of the film&apos;s highlights is when Momo&apos;&apos;s mentally defective and wife- murdering Muslim father turns up on Madame Rosa&apos;s doorstep after 11 years to claim him but she – in front of the boy&apos;s very own eyes – tries to pass off her other Jewish charge Moishe&apos; as his son; obviously, the broken man is horrified on learning that his Muslim offspring had been raised as a Jew, infuriatingly charges out of the room and expires at the foot of the steps from a heart attack! \n\nRosa herself – who is periodically afflicted by strokes (among other debilitating ailments) and is constantly being visited by a sympathetic medic (a fine Claude Dauphin) and doted upon by a friendly negro boxer- turned-transsexual prostitute(!) dubbed Madame Lola – does not want to be left alone or moved to a hospital and convinces Momo&apos; to let her die peacefully in her underground Jewish hideout. When she expires, he pretties her up with make-up and remains locked up in there with her corpse for a three weeks, until the deathly smell alerts the neighbours to the tragic event. Momo&apos; – who throughout the film was being schooled by a Muslim scholar fond of reading Victor Hugo&apos;s &quot;Les Miserables&quot; aloud to him (who eventually goes blind) – goes to live with an attractive female film editor (Mizrahi&apos;s own wife Michal Bat-Adam) whom he had befriended at a street corner puppet show; curiously enough, her live-in reporter companion, who also interviews Momo&apos; on his life experiences at one point, is played by Greek film director Costa-Gavras! Ultimately, having now watched MADAME ROSA, while definitely not superior to THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE, it is certainly better than Leonard Maltin&apos;s **1/2 rating and nowhere near as miserable a viewing experience as the plot outline above would suggest.",

The real fun is in the bizarre special-effects, the character references, the costumes, etc.\n\nTo enjoy this movie, make sure you know what the major players have done before.  Keep it in mind.  Listen to every word.  Have half-a-dozen other people there.  With lots of snacks or beer.\n\nOh, and the plot?  Who cares.  Much like a Batman or Addam&apos;s Family movie (for several reasons, both), this movie is about look, feel, and fun.  Plot is almost incidental."

Worried about his dad his son Hunter (Marsden) gives him a gift, a robot to help him remember things and help out around the house. At first Frank is opposed until he learns he can teach the robot to be his partner. I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect from this movie going in. It looked OK but also had a feeling it was going to be slow and a little dry. I was wrong. While the movie is not at all action packed or exciting it had an original idea that really kept you interested the entire time and I found it to be an enjoyable movie. There is comedy in this and the way its presented makes it seem like this thing could really happen. The movie is actually surprisingly touching and well worth seeing. I just don&apos;t know if I&apos;d watch it again, but I&apos;m glad I saw it once. Overall, a good and heartfelt movie that is well worth checking out. I give it a B.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the quirks of the English language is that although the words &quot;infidel&quot; and &quot;infidelity&quot; both derive from the same Latin root, meaning &quot;unfaithful&quot;, they normally have differing meanings in English. &quot;Infidelity&quot; generally refers to adultery or sexual unfaithfulness, whereas an &quot;infidel&quot; normally means someone who does not believe in the tenets of a particular religion. It would be unusual, to say the least, to use the word &quot;infidelity&quot; to mean religious unbelief or to call an adulterer an &quot;infidel&quot;. This film, however, is not concerned with the religious beliefs, or lack of them, of its main character, the writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. (He was raised as a Catholic but does not appear to have been a particularly devout one in adult life). I can only therefore assume that the title refers to his infidelity to his wife, Zelda.\n\nWhen I heard that the film was based on the life of Fitzgerald, I assumed that it would be about his wild and tempestuous life with Zelda during the twenties and early thirties. Instead, it concentrates on the last few years of his life, the period 1937 to 1940, and his relationship with his mistress, the journalist and gossip columnist Sheilah Graham. Indeed, Zelda does not appear in the film, although she is referred to. By 1937 Zelda was suffering from mental illness and was confined to a psychiatric hospital, but she and Scott were still married. Indeed, the two were never to divorce, and she legally remained his wife until his death.\n\nThe main problem with the film is that of miscasting. Gregory Peck&apos;s most frequent screen image was that of an authoritative, rational and gentlemanly figure, so he does not really seem a natural choice to play a notorious hell-raiser like Fitzgerald. Peck occasionally succeeded in his efforts to break away from his normal persona, as in &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; or &quot;Moby Dick&quot; in which he made a notable Captain Ahab, but in several other films attempts to cast him against type fell flat. A good example is &quot;Macarthur&quot; from the latter part of his career, in which he never succeeded in capturing General Macarthur&apos;s aggressive, combative personality. In the initial part of this film Peck portrays Fitzgerald as yet another quiet, charming gentleman, and his portrayal is certainly convincing, although I did find myself wondering how close it was to the real Scott Fitzgerald. His past struggles against alcoholism are referred to, but for a while it seems as though he has conquered his addiction. Midway through the film, however, Fitzgerald falls off the wagon after he is sacked from his job as a Hollywood scriptwriter, and Peck is much less convincing as a violent, abusive drunk than he is as a gentlemanly intellectual. \n\nFor a film made in the 1950s, with the Production Code still in force, this one is remarkably sympathetic in its treatment of adultery. Sheilah Graham is very much the heroine of the film, not its villain. (That is perhaps not surprising given that the film was based on her own memoirs. Fitzgerald had died in 1940 but Graham was still very much alive in 1959). She is portrayed as a kindly and understanding lover, patiently trying to help Scott deal with his problems, rather than as the heartless seductress which during this period was the standard cinematic image of women sexually involved with another woman&apos;s husband. Deborah Kerr was one of the screen&apos;s most famous &quot;good girls&quot;, although she also had the ability to portray characters who hid passionate natures beneath a quiet, reserved surface, such as Karen, the adulterous Army wife in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, the troubled Sister Clodagh in &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, the haunted governess in &quot;The Innocents&quot; or another haunted governess, Miss Madrigal in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;, in that case haunted by guilt rather than by anything supernatural. In &quot;Beloved Infidel&quot;, however, Kerr seemed unable to draw upon this ability, and her Sheilah comes across as a character who is all surface with nothing much going on underneath. Kerr also fails to make the most of another aspect of her character, the toughness and determination which enabled her to rise from poverty in Britain to become one of the most famous women in America.   \n\nThere are some good things about this film- the script is a good one and it is attractively photographed. For a film of its period it has touches of originality, breaking away from the traditional &quot;eternal triangle&quot; concept of marital infidelity, a triangle composed of a weak, erring husband, a saintly, long-suffering wife and a wicked other woman. (This concept was not confined to the fifties, or even to the Production Code era; &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; is a good example from the late eighties, and examples can still be found today). I felt, however, that it might have been better had alternative actors been found for the two leading roles. 6/10",

It has great setting and atmosphere, an intriguing plot and charm to boot. Such things scores a lot with me. The directing is at times questionable though, there is little sense of pacing and there are some parts that feel tacked on (the crazy flumride anybody)just because its supposed to be a summerfranchie. The cute little girl is completely superfluous, and Bill Murray and Treadaway&apos;s Doon doesn&apos;t make enough with their characters (or isn&apos;t allowed too). One thing is clear. Its strenghs of this film mostly resides within the source material(witch i haven&apos;t read though). Its really nice for a change to see a fantasy film without a lot of monsters, the enemies here are brain-stagnation, greed and selfishness. Some parts had me snickering. The parts where they are handed there jobs through lottery (a jab at communism?)and the old man with the pipes. THe story is actually pretty good, not original, but tightly woven and deceivingly fresh with a timely message. In short, the source-material had the brains, but the director lacked the guts (or maybe just the talent, or were assasinated by his studio) too go through with it.\n\nStill, it beats the latest Narnia installment, and the latest Harry Potter too for that matter. Also, Ronan, the kid from Atonement, turns in a good performance.",

Even though the first part of the movie is wacky to the point of rolling your eyes, there&apos;s enough to keep it going, even though it&apos;s clear this was made like a filler between more important jobs. The kids in these movies basically vanished from the big screen after this one.\n\nBrandenburg has a bigger part in this and shines here and there. He really needs another adult around to play his game, which the first movie lacked. There&apos;s an element of suspense in the movie which simply didn&apos;t exist in the first movie. There&apos;s also a sequence on a boat which is fairly amusing. The dialogue is also a step in the right direction. \n\nIf you must pick between the two, pick this one. Hands down.",

      "reviewBody": "Left in Darkness wasn&apos;t actually all that bad of a film. The description on the back left me very wary of what I was about to watch. The beginning was rather odd with the star as a little girl whose deafness to her grandfathers recommendations didn&apos;t bode well for a long life. The dreaded rape scene wasn&apos;t as horrible as I thought it would be, considering what some twisted directors have done with the subject. The story is about a woman who is raised by her grandparents after her mother dies giving birth and father disappears. She is killed at an animal house type of party by the typical drunken sociopath frat boys. She wakes up dead between heaven and hell and must fight for her soul using vague clues given to her by dead relatives and a guardian angel of sorts. It moves relatively quickly and has some good horror scenes. The editing was good and the camera work was good. The dialog was a little flat. The acting wasn&apos;t too bad and there were some seasoned actors in bit parts.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a picturesque afternoon in the park near the river. Kids run gleefully as parents set up picnic lunches and enjoy the sunshine. Young couples lay together on blankets, friends toss a Frisbee - it&apos;s just about perfect... except for the giant creature hanging from the bridge.\n\nParkgoers quickly gather to gape at the mysterious something. They ooh and aah when the great beast slides into to water and eases its way over to the shallows, idling just beneath the surface. No one senses any cause for alarm. They lean closer and toss snacks into the river, as if it&apos;s a cute family of ducks.\n\nBut ducks don&apos;t have teeth like this thing.\n\nThe crowd erupts into panic as the monster reveals its lethal force and ravenous appetite. Among the crowd scurrying for their lives are an old food shack owner, his young granddaughter, and her dad. The dad displays his bravery by facing the monster, but he also displays also his imperfections by... well, I won&apos;t spoil that part.\n\nDirector and writer Bong Joon Ho cleverly details the family&apos;s dysfunction through subtle dialogue before the monster chase and in the aftermath. This family is a ragtag group without much clue about what to do, but they are nevertheless relatable and easy to root for.\n\nThough the horror aspect is feature most prominently, the film contains layers beneath the surface for those interested in further examination. Bong Joon Ho manages to weave together elements of a family comedy, social satire, environmental conservation, and of course, a monster horror movie.\n\nThis is unequivocally Bong&apos;s movie. He expertly directs chase scenes with thrilling camera movements and engrossing framing choices that make you lean forward in your seat with excitement while you also partially cover your eyes in fear. It&apos;s a fascinating paradox.\n\nIn quieter moments, Bong unveils a novel&apos;s worth of background information through a few purposeful conversations between characters. Listen closely or you&apos;ll miss important details and have to watch the movie again. You&apos;ll probably want to anyway.",

The acting is very good, both by Jean Reno and Melanie Laurent as well. Even the child actors give good performances in general. There is nothing special or surprising regarding the plot, and most of the themes have already been presented effectively in other films, but this fact does not make the film bad in any way. The film manages to hold the tension and it succeeds in being moving at the same time. All in all, I watched this movie with undiminished interest from the beginning till the end and I think it deserves a higher rating than 5.6/10, as well as your attention",

Base on accounts of the social upheavals in various points and eras in Chinese history, it is filled with gorgeous cinematography, great score by Kitaro and great cast. Historically accurate if not, a few minor point may be incorrect, but as a whole, it shows you the big picture.\n\nWith some of the best stars there is from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Maggie Cheung, Michelle Khan and Vivian Wu portrayal as the three sister are excellent. But the most powerful in performance are from the men. Jiang Wen (outspoken Charlie Soong) also a favourite actor of mine, Winston Chou (charismatic Sun Yatsen) and Kuo Chiuwu (commanding Chiang Kaishek) are powerful and haunting.\n\nDespite an 18 minute footage cut from the original, still its a great direction from Mabel Cheung. As a loyal fan of great movies from China, in likes of directors Yimou, Kaige, XieFei and HePing, Soong Sisters to me will be one of my personal favourite masterpiece, one of the few from Hong Kong.\n\nGenghiz",

      "reviewBody": "Rainer Werner Fassbinder has long been honored as the &apos;bad boy&apos; in European cinema, a writer/director/actor who repeatedly has taken chances and because of his brutal honesty has succeeded in making a stream of important films. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS dates back to 1975 and remains one of Fassbinder&apos;s most successful films. As with all of his films, Fassbinder deals with the homosexual subculture in Germany but his main message goes far beyond the characters he creates: the examination of how people manipulate people for personal gain and the destruction that produces is a recurring problem and one that this film certainly explores.\n\n&apos;Fox&apos; - a nickname of Franz Bieberkopf - (acted with consummate skill by Fassbinder himself) is a lower class gay carny kid whose lover is arrested, leaving the carnival to collapse and leaving Fox without support. Enter handsome Max (Karlheinz Böhm), a wealthy antiques dealer, who picks up Fox, helps him buy the requisite &apos;lottery ticket&apos; on which Fox bases his hopes for financial survival (!) via manipulative means, and takes him home, introducing Fox to his gay friends who regard Fox as scum but show obvious physical attraction to his rawness. Surprisingly Fox wins the lottery and suddenly has 500,000 DMs and with his new money, Max&apos;s friends abruptly see a target for obtaining that money. One of the friends named Eugen (Peter Chatel) takes Fox in as a lover and talks him into investing in Eugen&apos;s family business of bookbinding. Eugen&apos;s father Wolf (Adrian Hoven) and mother (Ulla Jacobsson) tolerate their son&apos;s life with a low class wretch, ridiculing his manners and lack of culture and education, but willingly take his money to salvage their business.\n\nWith a lover and a business and a role model to make him suave, Fox dons fancy clothes, banters with his old friends in a tawdry club, and makes the pretenses that at last he is secure and happy. But in time Fox is blamed for problems at the business and when his funds have been depleted on expensive vacations and apartments by the smarmy self-centered Eugen, Fox realizes that now without money he has no &apos;fancy friends&apos;, no lover, no security and his life becomes unbearable: the ending to the film is a tragedy beyond description.\n\nSome would say the film is mannered in ways that depict stereotypes of the gay world (effeminate men, transvestites, opportunists, hustlers, etc), but Fassbinder is completely honest in his attempt to recreate a subculture of a specific time in Germany. And the characters are well written and well acted allowing us to look at Fassbinder&apos;s greater picture of depravity between social class antipathies. In many ways this is a difficult film to watch, but Fassbinder wisely places the main character whom he enacts in a place where his foibles and lack of higher class knowledge can be at once very humorous as well as pitiable. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS has some minor flaws but it has already become a classic in gay cinema repertoire. In German with English subtitles. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s impossible to recapture the absolute bliss of seeing this film for\n\nthe first time, in all its impudence and style; but watching it yet again this afternoon, I found a broad grin back on my face within minutes. Burt Lancaster&apos;s cocky Captain Vallo -- golden-haired, silver-tongued, and sporting a fine taste in trademark crimson trousers -- is a Technicolour pirate straight out of the pages of legend, and it&apos;s a toss-up as to whether it&apos;s more fun watching him dazzle and bamboozle his way through the ranks of the dastardly Spaniards, every sea-rover&apos;s traditional foe, or seeing him taken down a richly-deserved peg or two when events don&apos;t go quite as anticipated. If Vallo had it all his own way, he&apos;d be insufferable; but fortunately for the film, circumstances -- and the script -- conspire to unseat his schemes, with results both hilarious and touching.\n\nLancaster and Nick Cravat play off their old acrobatic routines against each other, separately and together, in a virtuoso display perfectly integrated into the action of the film. In &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot;, the acrobatics felt shoe-horned in to show off the star&apos;s abilities. Here they develop naturally from the conventions of the genre, and the grace of the big man and pugnacity of the little one make for a gifted double-act. In the role of the loyal mute Ojo (as the leader of their rebel captors observes dryly, &apos;this one can&apos;t talk and the other can&apos;t stop talking!&apos;) Cravat repeats his eloquent, quickfire mime from the earlier production, providing the last &apos;word&apos; for the film&apos;s ending and comic moments throughout.\n\nThe character of the first mate &apos;Humble&apos; Bellows, with his Quakerish speech and rigid adherence to the old ways, is also a triumph. Implacably opposed to his captain&apos;s flashy plans for a double- and triple-cross on the grounds that it&apos;s more like business practice than honest piracy, and unmoved by Vallo&apos;s gift of the gab, his doom-saying has the unpalatable habit of seeming to come true as one complication after another arises. Yet he has a stubborn integrity of his own, and his loyalty is to the ship&apos;s company where Vallo&apos;s veers like a weathercock. He is a complex character we cannot in a way help but admire.\n\nBut above all, the essence of &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; is that it&apos;s *very*, *very* *silly*. Gloriously silly. This isn&apos;t about realism -- this is comic-strip stuff, where battle consists of tossing your enemies overboard into the water, laying them out cold with a belaying-pin, or stacking them up one by one on the floor of the captain&apos;s cabin; where a man with a sword can duel a man with a swinging block on the end of a piece of rope, and an athletic fugitive can escape down narrow streets by using awnings as trampolines and washing-poles as parallel bars. Like &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, this film is both an affectionate spoof of its genre and a gripping contribution to that genre in its own right.\n\nThis is Adventure with a capital &apos;A&apos;, with a colourful unrepentant rogue of a hero, with devious Dons, thickwitted soldiery, heroic rebels, treachery, cruelty and gallantry against the odds - and generally an unexpected laugh around every corner. It&apos;s utterly impossible, of course, but -- believe only half of what you see... if that!",

The book is sort of difficult to read, but the movie is one big revelation. It may be because Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay for it and directed his own original brainchild that this film is so incredibly dense and gripping.\n\nMuch has been said about the plot and storyline, so I won&apos;t get on that here. The bottom line is, this movie is as original and authentic today as in 1971 when it was made (Vietnam war era, no less!), or even as in 1939 (at the eve of WW II!), the year the novel first appeared on bookshelves. A timeless classic if there ever was one, and a glowing testimony to the eternal insanity of war. Oftentimes subtle and subversive, its dialogs fully expose the madness of the whole concept of it. But it doesn&apos;t stop there, the film also examines the conflict between religion and war and the absurdity that ensues from justifying bloodshed through creed.\n\nI could go on forever trying to explain here why this movie is such a masterpiece to me, but maybe it&apos;s enough to tell whoever will read this to go buy the DVD. Like I said, it&apos;s a timeless anti-war classic that&apos;s worth every cent.",

Marcus did the song &quot; killing me softly &quot; because it was one of his mums favorites and even though the audience was banal and cruel he still had the gumption and heart to get up there an perform for his mom. life isn&apos;t about trying to fit in and be with the cool crowd, there&apos;s so much more important things in life then that and Marcus was mature enough to understand that, with help from Will of course. \n\nwell, i won&apos;t give anything else away about this movie, but if you&apos;re looking for a intelligent, heartwarming, tender, sad and funny movie, this is it. i would recommend this movie to just about anybody over the age of 10. this is one of those hidden little gems that has also a very strong positive message about what is right and what is wrong. there was not one dull moment in this movie and i think i must&apos;ve chuckle or guffawed about 50 times during the duration of this movie and it&apos;s not a long movie.\n\nif you like intelligent tender heartwarming comedic movies where all the actors and actresses were in top form...then you have to watch this movie. one of my favorite comedies all-time.",

They were bred from bears originally. But the experiment went wrong: otarks could crack logarithms and Einstein&apos;s theory but they were inhuman, they had no pity, compassion, friendliness. In the long run the reporter witnesses the ruin brought upon the local farmers, otarks hunting a girl,and hears a lot of blood-curdling stories. The otarks kill the forester, and eventually besiege the reporter in the abandoned building of the laboratory where the experiment began long ago. The film is about the responsibility of scientists and, probably, about the nature of a human being. It is positive that reason and thinking ability do not make a creature a &quot;human being&quot;. The film is almost forgotten, but not rightly so. It is worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "I live in Spain now and have nurtured an interest in twentieth century Spanish history, in particular the Spanish Civil War and the rise of the dictator Franco. I was completely unaware of this vintage Hollywood feature made while the war was still raging, starring an emergent Henry Fonda and the already established Madeleine Carroll.\n\nThe screenplay, as if you couldn&apos;t guess, is by one of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, John Howard Lawson, who wrote a number of left-leaning works for both the theatre and cinema at this time and I must admit I was surprised to learn that this one was nominated for an Academy Award this particular year.\n\nThe story is both simple and contrived. A lowly, young Spanish farmer, Fonda, with his oafish chum encounters Carroll after she crashes her car at breakneck speed on the road where they&apos;re walking their cattle. Just as you wouldn&apos;t guess Fonda was a native Spaniard from his accent, Carroll we later learn despite her cut-glass English accent is actually a Russian whose father, we learn is aiding the fascist Nationalist forces, presumably at the behest of Stalin.\n\nThen, of a sudden, the Spanish Civil War kicks off with Fonda&apos;s character seemingly unaware that it was even in the wind. Sure enough, he enlists on the underdog Republican side, although these descriptive terms are never used in the film and when he discovers Carroll&apos;s father&apos;s treachery to his country, shoots him dead. You might think that this would be enough to turn her forever against him but you&apos;d be wrong, although initially she of course has to see the error of her ways, even if she seems to have betrayed the starving native Spaniards by passing on intelligence which enables the oppressors to sink each relief ship, bringing in essential food and supplies, attempting to break the imposed blockade.\n\nIt sort of all ends up all right in the end thanks to a cunning piece of duplicity by the resistance with Fonda and Carroll now firmly committed to fighting for their poor countrymen, women and children with the last word going to Fonda making a rallying call directly to the viewer for other countries to help his beleaguered nation as they will surely be next to be threatened by the rise of fascism in the west.\n\nI&apos;m all for the political motivations behind the movie which must have taken some bravery for the cast and crew to produce but really it&apos;s very heavy-handed in its writing, seems to be directed in a very-slapdash fashion by William Dieterle and is acted over-earnestly by Carroll and in particular Fonda.\n\nI kind of wished the production had instead made the trip to Spain to film at first-hand in documentary fashion the horrors of this terrible war, but lame and stilted as this movie was, its heart at least was in the right place so I&apos;ll forgive some of its all too apparent flaws and give it a tacit nod of approval.",

Ervinka hangs with his friends all day and makes his living by ripping of people. He then falls in love with Ruti, the cop, and in order to win her heart he gets in constant brawls with the law. Ervinka and his friend decide to rob the lottery house, and... bla bla bla... The plot here is so redundant that it&apos;s laughable. This movie is all about the dialogue and the acting... It&apos;s a fun movie to watch, and at times is funny in a level that brings tears to your eyes. For those of you who like the Israeli version of camp movies (&quot;Burekas films&quot;) this is a must watch. This movie transforms the genre into a real form of art, with great use of camera, direction, acting and dialogue. Pure fun!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; is a surprisingly good movie that doesn&apos;t get shown a lot for some reason.   Greer Garson, Michael Wilding, Marjorie Main, and Fernando Lamas all shine in their roles.  Wilding&apos;s character convinces Garson&apos;s to team with him as globetrotting con artists who wind up in California trying to cheat a disarmingly candid (and as always, tough minded) Main.  Their plans are further complicated when Garson starts to fall for Lamas and starts to rethink her relationship with Wilding.\n\nThe comedy is light-hearted and avoids taking itself too seriously. Knopf, brother of the famous publisher, only directed a few films, and this was his only effort after the early 1930&apos;s.  He was able to get good performances from his excellent cast.\n\n1960&apos;s TV fans will recognize Natalie Schafer (Gilligan&apos;s Island) and Hayden Rorke (I Dream of Jeannie) playing small but noticeable roles.",

Those who dismiss it in the first glance will miss an unusually compelling, worthwhile science fiction film that belies its low-budget origin.\n\nLet&apos;s briefly rattle off some of it&apos;s merits: \n\n~It&apos;s got no annoying loopholes; everything works and makes sense. Odd how a &apos;small&apos; movie can sometimes do this better than a big-budget production.\n\n~The special effects don&apos;t get in the way of the story. And there is quite good photography, too.\n\n~The narrative itself, focuses on a human situation, rather than being pointlessly technological, or un-engaging fantasy. It&apos;s the same foundation that made &apos;Alien&apos; great. People are at the heart of this movie.\n\n~Set design is complementary in that is innocuous, unobtrusive, measured. Again, properly servile to the plot.\n\n~The actors are all low-budget actors from TV land. Once again, a case of &quot;less is more&quot;. They are unknowns, so they are abstracted for the viewer, and this allows for fluid, accessible characterizations.\n\n~Pacing is efficient, economical, simple, and linear, with no waste. The director takes us exactly to the emotional climax comfortably and confidently.\n\nWith all that said, I think its just a great little sci-fi story: an intriguing plot that, humbly executed in a no-frills manner, sticks with you over time. I would love to have this in my collection."

Attack from Space may be my introduction to Starman, but it won&apos;t the last time I pay him a visit.\n\nIn Attack from Space, the Earth is threatened by a race of aliens known as the Spherions. They show they mean business by blowing up one of the mountains in the Himalayas (odd choice, but whatever). A benevolent race of aliens from the Emerald planet send their superhero, Starman, to Earth to help defeat the Spherions. Starman discovers that one of the Earth&apos;s top scientists and his family have been abducted. Can he rescue the Earthlings and save the planet?\n\nRating and writing about a film like Attack from Space is difficult because, honestly, it&apos;s a train wreck of a film. Special effects, dubbing, lighting, acting, plot, logic, and just about anything else you can name is so bad it&apos;s impossible to put into words. It&apos;s bad, but it&apos;s also bizarrely fun. Things like the crazy looking council on the Emerald planet, the Nazi-esque aliens dressed like 1940s era US Navy officers, Starman&apos;s lumpy superhero suit, and, most of all, the ridiculous fight choreography - I can&apos;t describe what joy these things brought to me. Even though the fight scene between Starman and the Spherions overstayed its welcome by what seemed like hours, it&apos;s still the real highlight of the film. Starman has a style of fighting I&apos;ve never seen before. He reminded me of the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz trying to do Kung Fu. Hysterical. The use of silly looking guns, reversed camera shots, and the most obvious dummy I&apos;ve ever seen only added to the fun. Seriously, this is truly one of those &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; type movies. I&apos;m looking forward to the others in the series.",

Speaking of Mr. Greenstreet, he is FABULOUS in the film as the president from a soap factory with no soul. You MUST see the segment when he is first introduced, as it is one of the most memorable and disgusting scenes in the 1940s! You gotta see it to believe it! Also notable is the performance of a young Keenan Wynn as an obnoxious and untalented star. He does a good job of being annoying!",

Brown is very good in this comedy about a health camp that occasionally tries to go the crazy comedy route -- he and Winnie Lightner together sound like Wheeler and Woolsey -- but, despite many good moments, the whole thing is less chaotic than muddled.\n\nMr. Brown, who rose to prominence in SALLY, was moving out of the musical-comedy roles that had defined him on stage into the brash roles that became his type for the next ten years. Sometimes, as noted, he sounds like half of Wheeler and Woolsey, sometimes he sounds like Charley McCarthy and sometimes he seems to be channeling Bert Lahr. He is excellent at the physical comedy -- his circus background was a real asset to physical comedy -- and it&apos;s easy to see why within a couple of years he would be one of Warner Brothers&apos; biggest stars.\n\nMiss Lightner sings one song and scraps with Mr. Brown, who is in love with her and there is a considerable subplot with young lovers Paul Gregory and Claudia Dell -- he&apos;s quite good and she is gorgeous. Tom Kennedy has a nice hulking bit. But despite some nice comedy construction, the remnants of a standard 1920s musical comedy plot render this antiquated.",

To clarify where I&apos;m coming from, yes, I like many so-called art-house films, and don&apos;t mind long takes per se, but this movie had so many scenes where I was begging for them to end and move on to the next bit of business, because they were so tedious.\n\nMore problems: The leads are not particularly charismatic, nor do we ever really care about any of the characters. And overall, this film just doesn&apos;t really have much to say. About anything.\n\nHonestly, I cannot really even explain why I sat through the entire length of the film, other than to say I suppose I kept hoping for something to happen. There were no surprises here whatsoever. The only reason I&apos;m leaving this review here is so that other people don&apos;t stumble across it and get the impression from some of the other comments that it&apos;s worthwhile seeing. In my opinion, it&apos;s not."

      "reviewBody": "HIPPIE MASALA: Forever in India is a documentary film by Ulrich Grossenbacher and Damaris Lüthi about six people who went on the overland trail to India in the late 1960s/early 1970s and decided to stay. Cesare from Italy became a sadhu (a religious beggar) and spends his days chanting in the company of his Indian peers. Meera from Belgium did the same, though as a woman her experience has been quite different. Hanspeter from Switzerland settled down the Himalayas, maintaining a dairy farm and going hunting and fishing. Robert from Holland got into trouble as a youth running away from home and selling drugs, but once he made it to India he established a career as a painter. Finally, Erica and Gillian are South African twins who now design clothes in Goa, though we mostly view these two lushes enjoying their drinks.\n\nThe film has a number of interesting moments. Hanspeter and Robert have Indian wives, and the documentary discusses in some detail the cultural clashes of marrying a local. Some of the subjects speak of conflicts with their family that led them to leave Europe.\n\nHowever, what stops this from being a great documentary, at least in my opinion, is that it gives very little information on the years between the overland trail and wherever they are now, especially their changing attitudes to the counterculture of 40 years ago. Hanspeter, for example, complains about people seeking a good time in India and says &quot;Couldn&apos;t you have a techno party in Switzerland instead of coming here?&quot; but we don&apos;t get a deeper glimpse into how his feelings have changed. Furthermore, anyone looking for more trivia on the overland trail will be disappointed. The first couple of minutes of the film show some fascinating footage of e.g. the Pie Shop in Istanbul and roads in Afghanistan (I&apos;d love to know where these came from), but none of the interview subjects go into detail on this great migration.\n\nUltimately this documentary will appeal mostly to those interested in how foreigners adapt to Indian society and how they are accepted by the local people around them. The fact that these are hippies who came on the great overland trail four decades ago is pretty irrelevant -- the same sort of documentary could be made about people who arrived on a jet plane in the 1980s or 1990s.",

      "reviewBody": "Abslutely loved the first film and just as much &apos;After theThin Man&apos; and expected a lot from &apos;Another Thin Man&apos;. The second of five sequels (all above watchable) and the third of six films (the others being &apos;The Shadow of The Thin Man&apos;, &apos;The Thin Man Goes Home&apos; and &apos;Song of the Thin Man&apos;), this to me is not as good as the first film but still completments the first film beautifully. It may not quite be the hit that &apos;After the Thin Man&apos; was, but it did make me merry enough and has a lot to recommend, while not without its flaws.\n\nFirst things first, William Powell and Myrna Loy are always worth watching. Not just individually, and both (especially Powell) were immensely talented actors, but their partnership was/is a classic one, another classic one being Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, that can be seen in fourteen films. Including a further eight other than the six &apos;The Thin Man&apos; films. &apos;Another Thin Man&apos; on the most part serves them well and doesn&apos;t waste them in any way.\n\nIt&apos;s not a perfect film. Do agree that it is somewhat too plot heavy at times, with some of it being a touch convoluted and not as clear as it could have been. Occasionally the pacing could have been crisper.\n\nDo feel that although the mystery is fun and suspenseful, the interplay and banter between Powell and Loy are much more interesting and entertaining and would have liked even more of it. Neither are done badly, far from it, it just could have been better balanced. Once again Dorothy McNaulty overdoes it and came over as annoying\n\nThere is a lot to like however. The photography is both elegant and moody, once again some of the best of the series, while the sets are simple but tasteful and appropriate. Continue to love the costumes and fashions, once again Loy looks fabulous in clothes that suit her perfectly and the camera clearly loves her. The music is jaunty yet atmospheric, with some great songs that have aged well, and the direction is more than competent.\n\nScript is quite rightly so full of wit and sophistication, in a way that is hilarious and charming. The banter never fails to entertain and the more physical comedy never feels overdone. Also thought that there was a lot of relatability in Nick and Nora&apos;s situation. The story execution isn&apos;t perfect but mostly it is engaging, with a mystery that is fun enough, suspenseful with some nice twists and an ending that is far from predictable. As others have said, one of the film&apos;s highlights is the dance scene.\n\nPowell and Loy are on top form here once again, with Powell clearly has a great time being charming and suave. Loy is glamour personified and the easy-going and magnetic chemistry between her and Powell is what makes the film, and the whole &apos;The Thin Man&apos; series for that matter, work so well, for me it is one of film&apos;s most legendary partnerships. The supporting cast are also great, with Asta coming close to stealing the show.\n\nOn the whole, enjoyable and worth watching if not as good as &apos;The Thin Man&apos;. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "West Germany, late 1950s: Lola (Barbara Sukowa) is a singing prostitute working in a brothel that the town&apos;s bigwigs, even the mayor, like to frequent. To the annoyance of the corrupt construction entrepreneurs, especially a crass man named Schukert (Mario Adorf), the town&apos;s new building commissioner von Bohm (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is an honest and idealistic man who tries to clean up the building license politics from bribery and cheating. One day Lola approaches von Bohm, piques his interest and eventually leads him to dream of marriage with her – but how will he react when Lola&apos;s true profession is eventually revealed?\n\nLola was my first Fassbinder film, so I don&apos;t know how it compares to his other works or the other two films in the BRD trilogy, but I can say that I was impressed by the unique style. Almost all of the scenes are lit with very bright and coloured lights, frequently painting the characters in different colours even when in the same frame. The music is also light in tone, often highly comedic, making the serious-sounding tale of corruption appear as silly and petty games of fooling each other. Various characters also provide plenty of over-the-top comedy; particularly Schukert whose dancing in the brothel with the singing Lola on his shoulders provides perhaps the most outrageous scene in the whole film. Nevertheless, it&apos;s not all comedy, as the characters&apos; serious emotional development is also examined. Besides von Bohm&apos;s realization of the true nature of things, Lola&apos;s confusion about what to do with the men surrounding her is also absorbing to see.\n\nAll in all, Fassbinder&apos;s exaggerated and satirical approach to Germany&apos;s era of post-war rebuilding is thoroughly entertaining thanks to the visual style and the lovely music. The actors, from the obnoxious Mario Adorf to the enigmatic Barbara Sukowa, do a good job too, and I consider the film a both delightful and thought-provoking piece of cinema that has definitely got me interested in seeing more of the director&apos;s work.",

Schools in the poorest sections of New York City are still under funded. The Calvin Coolidge High School appears more like a prison than a school. The atmosphere reminds me of going to the unemployment office where its grim and depressing. How can anybody believe learning is going on? Of course not, schools are supposed to prepare our students for the future but are terribly let down. Today&apos;s students believe technology will solve everything. We can&apos;t teach how to think as teachers. This film should be shown to all aspiring teachers about the reality of urban school teaching.",

      "name": "A great comedy for people who love the movies",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Bowfinger&quot; is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years.  It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other&apos;s personalities, without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well, because that&apos;s what it&apos;s really about; how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences, and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.\n\nThe movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie, to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger, of &quot;Bowfinger International Productions&quot;, a hack film &quot;studio&quot; in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team; he&apos;s unscrupulous, infinitely resourceful, and isn&apos;t daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid, stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.\n\nHis accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don&apos;t ask, just watch the movie.  The movie is called &quot;Chubby Rain&quot;.  Bowfinger wants Hollywood&apos;s leading action star, Kit Ramsey, to play the lead.  As Ramsey, Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of &quot;Mind Head&quot;, one of those many Scientologist-like groups, where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears, like that of, of course, aliens.\n\nNaturally, Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn&apos;t stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever, if risky, idea: follow Ramsey around, shoot him surreptitiously from a distance, using his own actors to play their parts with him, without Ramsey&apos;s knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real, while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey&apos;s &quot;style&quot;.\n\nEventually, a stunt double is needed for certain scenes, and a Ramsey look alike, named Jiff, is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character, played also by Murphy as a slow-witted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time, to Murphy&apos;s credit, and a great movie character.\n\nI liked a lot of things about the movie, especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a high-powered executive played by Robert Downey, Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin&apos;s phone; he may not take him seriously, but he&apos;s not likely to forget meeting him.\n\nI also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  &quot;That&apos;s too cerebral for an audience,&quot; shouts Ramsey.  &quot;We&apos;re making a movie, not a film!&quot;  He points out that in the script he is reading, the letter &quot;k&quot; appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three, so &quot;KKK&quot; appears &quot;486 times!&quot;\n\nWhat is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke, improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly, even if he bends a few rules along the way."

      "reviewBody": "Summer again and probably most of you think Flashpoint is the one to watch this season. Maybe, but now it sure has its work cut out for it, with an amazingly satisfying, over the top, touching and down right honorable release from dear old Benny Chan.\n\nMr. Chan&apos;s New Police Story was an admitted wink at good action things past, and Invisible Target bears the same hallmarks of quality only much better implemented.\n\nOstensibly, it&apos;s a promising flick with a strong cast finally heralding the return of two of this reviewer&apos;s fave tough guys: enigmatic and oft crazed Shawn Yue and sulking, intellectual trouble maker Nicholas Tse.\n\nOf course a lot could still go wrong but it dawns on one that Invisible Target is an awesome movie right from the first scene when they proceed to blow things up with extreme prejudice smack in the middle of Hong Kong&apos;s Central business area, namely Queen&apos;s Road.\n\nYes, Eye in the Sky had a heist taking place in the same locale, but that one was pale and forgettable. Here we have a ballsy depiction of crooks on the loose that brings a tear to the most jaded of eyes as you sit there reminding yourself that this isn&apos;t merely how they used to make them, here they are, making them like that in this day and age.\n\nOh yes, just like New Police Story, Invisible Target has kick ass villains, headed by martial artist Wu Jing, whose deranged but respectable streak was previously flexed in SPL. The guy&apos;s simply spectacular as a bad guy, as is cool dude Andy On. Andy shone in New Police Story alongside Daniel Wu, and here he&apos;s even better, adding a sensible, human side to his nefarious character.\n\nIndeed, the antagonists here are all well done and conspicuously Putonghua speakers. Hmmm. Regardless, they help make Invisible Target an excellent release you must not miss out on.\n\nAs we behold, the baddies wreak havoc in jolly HK, setting in motion a storyline that has Inspector Tequila-inspired Shawn and Nicholas go after them with a vengeance, aided by Jaycee Chan who for once is truly impressive and adds much to the story.\n\nThe three cops engage with the demented robbers across a variety of locations, using fists, feet, guns, cars and a variety of other tools. This movie is a field day for makers of breakaway glass everywhere, as literally not a single sheet remains intact for more than a second.\n\nInvisible Target isn&apos;t a dour-faced, overly serious affair, it gets the balance between crime drama and lunatic fantasy just right as cops and robbers leap huge heights and take more punishment than your average WWII battleship could ever hope to withstand.\n\nWith good supporting appearances from Sam Lee, Lam Suet and even Aaron Kwok, this is out and out a fun, thrilling and gripping film. It&apos;s aggressively cartoonish at times but always professional and never coming across ridiculous. It&apos;s also atypically long for its genre or for Hong Kong releases in general, coming in at a hefty 130 minutes, which still isn&apos;t close to enough.\n\nIn the end, good triumphs but there really isn&apos;t any evil here, as even the vilest of people seen in the story has an explanation for what they do and a tale to tell, which is an added bonus not to be overlooked.\n\nPlus, how can you say no to the first SDU sighting in a long, long, long time? Yes, they return to battle Wu Jing and his crew, and of course promptly get their posteriors handed to them.\n\nInvisible Target is a frenzied, beautiful assemblage of classical themes (there&apos;s even a British cop in the briefing room like in the good old days), gorgeous stunts, mind-boggling explosions, intricate fight scenes and ever-shattering glass partitions.\n\nThe macho-sensitive cast is a perfect fit and we&apos;re delighted to see them together and on screen again. In fact, aside from giving logic and physical reality as we know it the finger, there&apos;s nothing wrong with Invisible Target and I, for one, can&apos;t wait to get my hands on the DVD version.\n\nInvisible? Anything but! Don&apos;t wait for Flashpoint, get your summer kicks right here, right now.",

      "reviewBody": "Of all the film versions of Schnitzler&apos;s play, this is far and away the most faithful both to the letter and the spirit of the original. (Though the celebrated Max Ophuls version, LA RONDE (1950), is the greater film, it takes extensive liberties with, and rather romanticises, Schnitzler&apos;s text.) Veteran Viennese director Otto Schenk is perfectly attuned to the cultural nuances of the play, and evokes a wholly credible and finely-textured recreation of his native city circa 1900, free of the usual clichés and sentimentality. Refreshingly, he roots the work in its specific historical time and place (even the Viennese accents sound right) and lets the brilliant text speak for itself. There is no &quot;opening-out&quot;, and the dialogues are played out in their proper settings, which are very nicely realized.\n\nIn a departure from theatrical tradition, Schenk eschews blackouts or dissolves when it comes to the sex -- as it does in all but one of the ten two-handers that make up the cycle. Try as one might, the resulting bouts of matter-of-fact rumpy-pumpy call to mind the jolly German soft-core porn of the era, and do not entirely work; but it is a brave and worthwhile experiment, evidently undertaken in a Schnitzlerian spirit of frankness rather than out of a desire to &quot;sex-up&quot; a costume drama.\n\nThe strong ensemble cast do a generally fine job. The performance that stands out in every way is Maria Schneider&apos;s, as the &quot;Sweet Young Girl&quot;: inspired casting and a luminous screen presence.\n\nSadly, the current version of the DVD (as at 2007) lacks English subtitles, so non-speakers of German may need to bone up beforehand with one of numerous available English translations of the play. It&apos;s worth the trouble, though.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a movie that was made in the late &apos;60s, early &apos;70s period of Japan when Japan influenced by the Hippie culture was experimenting with their own brand of Avant Garde. These were experimental non-mainstream production that explored much about free sex, and anti establishment view of the world. Director Nagisa Ooshima always had Avant Garde taste to his movies. He was one of the directors that were part of movement called Nuberu bagu ( from the French nouvelle vague) or Japanese New Wave.\n\nThe movie were made employing all non-experienced actors. This was the first Ooshima film that didn&apos;t use any known actors, and his last black and white movie. Due to the lack of experience of the actors, acting is wooden, and dialogs are totally &quot;read&quot; from the script. The movie was completed from start to the theaters in exactly 60 days (April 28 1970 to June 27 1970). Even for the fast shooting Ooshima, this was exceptionally fast production.\n\nThe movie was targeted for the college students of that time, but poor acting, and somewhat documentary style didn&apos;t get support from its intended audiences. But maybe Ooshima and the producers knew that the intended audience weren&apos;t worth making lavishly produced movie, because they are (were) youth just like the people who were in this movie, who were rather shallow but opinionated about their world view. \n\nLooking back with 20/20 hind sight, this movie is rated high for it&apos;s accurate portrayal of the society of the time, and Ooshima might have had exceptional foresight to focus his attention on the subject the way he did in this movie. Not for nothing is he a medal of honor winner from both the Japanese and French government where he&apos;s directed many excellent movies.\n\nOoshima is probably the most talented of the director from the Japanese New Wave period, and certainly one of the most talented director to come out of Japan. He&apos;s like a mixture of Federico Fellini, and Roger Corman with crisp visual style all his own.\n\nFor most of the actors, this was their first and last film they appeared in. The actor who played the main character Kazuo Gotoh became a journalist, and his girlfriend Emiko Iwasaki appeared in few minor roles before she retired completely from the film business."

      "reviewBody": "Never in my whole life have I ever watched a documentary that was so detailed down to every last thing and has been so influential and haunting at the same time.   What Eleanor Coppola did was make a documentary that showed filmmakers not what to and how to solve the things that go wrong and also not to jump into something without realising it&apos;s outcome.  What she also did was collect moments on the set and off of the greatest film ever made.\n\nI have always made that known when reviewing a lot of films on IMDB how much this film means to me and when you watch Heart of Darkness without flickering an eyelid you kind of find out why.   At the beginning of the documentary you see Francis ford Coppola talking about Apocalypse Now at a press conference and he says the famous line `The film wasn&apos;t about Vietnam, it was Vietnam&apos; and after hearing it you are thinking what the hell is this guy on about and then you watch it and you think to yourself `Oh he was probably right bless him&apos; because no one apart from the cast and crew knew what he really meant.  Then you watch the documentary and you eat your words because we see how much pressure he was under and Brando and Martin Sheen&apos;s heart attack didn&apos;t help but he pulls through.   It was like he made a pack with the devil for his film to be an absolute nightmare to make but for the final outcome to become a glorified Masterpiece which is what it is.\n\nTo see what had happened when filming stopped in the jungle with the tribe and the footage of the cow&apos;s and pigs being slaughtered to death was extraordinary and disturbing that this really happens.  In the scene where the cow or bull (I don&apos;t know) gets hacked into pieces is well known for being real but it was well constructed before Francis said `action&apos; but on the documentary you see a number of men just go up to the animal and do what they have to do.  It&apos; really sinks in when looking at that part what kind of film Apocalypse Now is.   I would have liked to have seen a bit more of Brando but I think it&apos;s good that we don&apos;t because it just like the film in that respect that even in a documentary he continues to be secluded from the rest and kept in the dark.  Francis Ford Coppola was wasted after making Apocalypse now.   Never will Hollywood not even Peter Jackson ever see a director like Francis because films like Apocalypse Now will probably never be made again because of the financial side of the business but Coppola was beyond a director, he was a master that had no hold on itself and without his belief and madness we wouldn&apos;t be blessed with this outstanding film. It&apos;s not a point that I am making it&apos;s a fact and it destroys me to think there is nobody challenging the ways he did anymore, but in a way I like it like that."

That was the dot com boom era, I know and was in New York and couldn&apos;t leave coz my phone and email box were ramed with jobs every week - it was madness and the gold rush posse included many &apos;artists&apos; looking for a new cyber angle to sell their s**t..\n\nI consulted a lot for &apos;visual artists&apos; who were usually film guys looking for a new spin to get bucks to put thier ideas up. That&apos;s me, now this film is intersting coz it&apos;s from the UK, London who were behind NY in the cyber  media buzz.  Now   most of the interviews are with Americans P.Funk, Tate, Delaney etc. This poses the problem how do you make a documentary interesting when it is full  with folks who already have been interviewed tons of times, who already have bodies of work out there?\n\nWell these guys put in this Cyber detective character myth, that doesnot make much sense.  My mate said it didn&apos;t need to coz it&apos;s Sci Fi, but I don&apos;t buy that. My mate like that spin, I said it was a cheezy attempt to make lame music doc. interesting by adding a sci fi tinge to it. Check it for yourselfs. At the very least it&apos;s a one off, not many black made cyber docs with P. Funk  in the mix that I know of from Europe. PS: I just know the germans went crazy for rubbish like this, they went for David Hasselhoff"

This one concentrates on character development rather than excitement, at least that&apos;s how I interpreted it. This silent version is also a tribute to the hard work done by the unsung heroes at the Library of Congress to restore old movies in need of restoration. This one had been cannibalized by Warner Bros. for their remake , having removed many battle scenes, except for a rousing one at the end of the picture.\n\nThis restoration is clear and with hardly any flaws in the print. It has a cast of long forgotten actors, and, truth be told, is just not as interesting as the later version. Shown at Capitolfest, Rome, NY, 8/19.\n\n****** 6/10 - Website no longer prints my star rating."

Well he&apos;s topped here in my opinion by a gorgeous and very talented Robert Hoffman and a sexy and fierce Brianna Evigan (Sorority Row). This time around we are introduced to a competition called the street in which a group of MSA students gather to become a crew and compete. The politics are expected but effective and the dance sequences are electrifying. I&apos;d be lying if I said this wasn&apos;t a guilty pleasure filled with melodrama but it&apos;s the best of the series, overly entertaining and filled with some diverse, colorful characters. Funny, romantic and thrilling.\n\nBudget: $17.5M Box Office: $150.8M\n\n7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Most of the joint efforts between European countries that speak different languages are awful. Usually it is two directors with two different points of view that are only made worse by the language barriers, and the end result is edited together mish-mash of the best scenes from each director. By comparision, while this movie is a bit rough and choppy, it gets to all the points and ends well.\n\nChristopher Lee is excellent as Sherlock Holmes. Until recently (Jeremy Brett, Robert Downey, Jr., and Cumberbatch) most Sherlock Holmes movies were low budget. Basil Rathbone was great as Sherlock Holmes, but his movies usually had no props and very little action besides the great acting and the great stories. It was all low budget.\n\nProfessor Moriarty has an outstanding home office which is full of excellent Egyptian artifacts and serpent memorabilia. Moriarty is now a world known archaeologist as the cover for his crime syndicate. I thought that was a creative twist that made Moriarty a lot more interesting. While Hans Söhnker, playing Moriarty, was not as nefarious as George Zucco, Lionel Atwill, or Henry Daniell; he was no slouch either.\n\nThorley Waters as Dr. Watson tries hard to look and act like Nigel Bruce. Compared to Nigel Bruce, Waters is very wooden. His performance is a bit creepy. There are a couple of scenes were Waters is literally recreating remarks and gestures that are straight from Nigel Bruce. As a big fan of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, seeing Waters mimicking Nigel Bruce was a bit too much. I give Waters credit for good intentions, but he is way short of the Dr. Watson that Nigel Bruce was.\n\nOverall, the story is better than a lot of other movies that are not based on original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories. It has some good ideas, some good acting, and some good action. I appreciate that the actors did their best to create a united artistic effort between two nations that were bitter enemies during World War II.",

      "reviewBody": "This has been a huge week for &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, as it set a record for a female-directed movie with over $100,000,000 at the box office. However, in all the excitement over this film there is another superhero movie that debuted as well that deserves our attention as well&quot;Captain Underpants&quot;! And, after having seen both films, I have to admit that I enjoyed watching &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; more because it is something few superhero movies are these days.it&apos;s fun! Please understand meI am not saying it&apos;s necessarily better. However, it is a lot of fun and lightheartedthings you&apos;d almost never associate with today&apos;s very dark superhero filmsand reasons you might not want to take kids to see most of the pictures in this genre.\n\nIn order to enjoy the Captain Underpants movie it sure helps if you are a childor if you are a bit childish. My daughters grew up reading the Captain Underpants books and Dav Pilkey&apos;s character certainly has been a hit among kids. Why do kids love Captain Underpants? Well, it&apos;s everything serious literature is notit&apos;s filled with potty humor, bad jokes and silliness because Pilkey wrote and illustrated the books as if they were really created by mischievous childrenthe same George and Harold who are the stars of the film. And, having been a middle school teacher as well as a man who adamantly refuses to grow up, I had a wonderful time seeing it with my 22 year-old daughterwho also loved the movie.\n\nThe story begins with George and Harold being called into their very grouchy principal&apos;s office. As usual, they are up to no good and as usual the mirthless man is about to throw the book at the boys sending them to separate classroomswhich is horrible since they are best friends. However, in desperation, George tries out his cheap hypno- ring he got in a cereal box and amazingly it worksturning the principal into the boys&apos; slave. They decide to make him become Captain Underpantsthe hero in the comic book the boys have created. And, like this character, the principal begins running around town fighting crime.in his underwear! Little do the boys realize that they&apos;ll need his help when the evil Professor Poopypants arrives with his latest weapon!\n\nOkayI&apos;ll admit this does not sound like Shakespeare or Jane Austin. You&apos;ve got Professor Poopypants, comments about Uranus and fart jokes. But these are exactly what kids really loveand I heard lots of kids laughing throughout the movie. And, even though I am supposed to be sophisticated and above all this, I found myself laughing too.\n\nI also appreciate how the Canadian team who made the film managed to capture the look, style and spirit of the Captain Underpants books. While the CGI is not the most complicated I&apos;ve ever seen, it matches the characters perfectlyand even offers a cute added sock puppet show! Funny, well written and a lot of fun, this is NOT a good date night movie but a perfect film if you&apos;ve got kids (young or even grown like mine) who grew up with Pilkey&apos;s creation. Not to be missed.",

Hope is at his comic best, delivering every line with the sort of casual flair for comedy that served him so well during his early years at Paramount.\n\nBut having the most fun are VICTOR McLAGLEN as the hook-bearing pirate with a devilish gleam in his eye; WALTER BRENNAN as the maniacal, half-witted pirate called Featherbrain who relishes every scene and gives one of his best supporting role performances; and WALTER SLEZAK as the wicked man who wants the treasure map and Mayo for his own.\n\nNot to be outclassed by these comic performances, we also have HUGO HAAS as the cabaret owner who shares some priceless one-liners with Hope who auditions for a job in his cabaret. The drinking scene is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nDirected at a frantic pace by David Butler, this is one of Hope&apos;s most enjoyable romps and it&apos;s all dressed up in fancy Technicolor and lavish sets and costumes.\n\nNot to be missed, if you&apos;re a Hope fan.",

I liked that the kid had a There&apos;s Nothing Out There t-shirt -- That&apos;s self-referential, to a self-referential movie, before there was such a thing as a self-referential horror movie (Have I lost you? I&apos;m referring to There&apos;s Nothing Out There, 1991). I got a headache thinking about it. What is it with people complaining about sex and nudity in a B-horror movie? Tiffany Shepis is in this one. She&apos;s going to get naked. It&apos;s a given. Sheesh, how PC do you have to be to complain about sexual content in a genre flick?",

      "reviewBody": "About 15 minutes into this quirky film I was ready to proclaim it a must see and to bill it as the best movie no one has seen or even heard about. After all it was Coppola&apos;s masters thesis for film school. It has Elizabeth Hartman successfully playing against type as a sexy (somewhat psycho) Greenwich Village ingénue. It has Peter Kastner, Rip Torn, Geraldine Page and Julie Harris playing characters more bizarre than anything in &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (it reminds you a lot of that film and may have inspired it). It has Karen Black doing a toned down version of the Rayette Dipesto character she would play in &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;. It has a lively sound track by the Lovin&apos; Spoonful. It even has Coppola cutting in extensive gruesome footage from his first film &quot;Dementia 13&quot;.\n\nUnfortunately by the halfway point of &quot;You&apos;re a Big Boy Now&quot; it totally runs out of steam and you begin to understand that its obscurity is well-deserved. Coppola&apos;s script is the problem because the cast are generally excellent and you can tell they had a lot of fun making the film. Even minor cast members like Dolph Sweet do a good job and there are great little sequences like Kastner&apos;s after dark explorations of the New York City streets. But unlike &quot;Herald and Maude&quot;, Coppola says nothing with this film; consequently it ends up as a classic case of the whole being considerably less than the sum of its parts.\n\nI am not in love with Coppola as a director, but even those who are will acknowledge the incredible distance between his good stuff and the vast majority of his films. This is not his good stuff but is worth checking out if you like Hartman, Harris, and Page.",

What could have been a German variation on Chabrol&apos;s malicious little dramas, turns out to be a hollow nut. \n\nThe inept golfer played by Friedrich von Thun stands emblematically for the entire project: Verhoeven sees the target, but fails miserably in delivering the desired result.\n\nPlus: Mario Adorf gives his usual stiff performance. He must be suffering from a severe paralysis of his facial muscles. Qualtinger and Flickenschildt&apos;s charisma is not enough to save this disaster movie.",

      "reviewBody": "With the exception of films like The Oogieloves and the Fred trilogy, I claim Snoopers (or whatever the movie is even called really) to be one of the stupidest films ever made. Judging by the original title, I understand that the film was originally German given an English dub, but seriously there should be no excuse for such horrible lip sync--a problem that takes me completely out of the element of a movie or show. Speaking of dubbing, the line delivery is no better either. Say what you will about films like The Shaggy Dog or whatever, but at least the actors made their line deliveries more believable and not sound like the actors just learned how to speak the day before filming began--I have literally seen elementary schoolers in a school play deliver better lines than these people. However, that isn&apos;t the only problem I have with the movie, as there are others. The film is also lazy. How lazy? About as lazy as having the same actor play both the dead magician and that apothecary (or whatever he is--the movie is too lazy to even establish any clear-cut characters). Granted, there&apos;s nothing wrong with an actor taking on multiple roles in a single movie/show, but if you&apos;re going to act out two or more characters--each one completely different and unrelated to the other--at least make each of them sound different, especially in a movie like this! But the real frosting on the garbage cake which is this movie are the &quot;Vipers&quot; they supposedly use. I understand that the creators of the film didn&apos;t want to hurt anyone, but Pythons? Really? Did the creators truly think we as an audience couldn&apos;t see that? Did they think people would be stupid enough to think that a Viper and a Python looked alike? Remember the scene in The Black Stallion when the boy character found himself face-to-face with a real Cobra? You know how they pulled that scene without the actor getting hurt? Glass, that&apos;s how--and the film was made in like the early to mid 1970s. What, could the filmmakers not afford a sheet of glass to pull off something like that in ther 1990s dumpster fire film?\n\nOverall, the film had (in my opinion) a very bland plot (the leat offensive thing in the movie believe it or not), especially in comparison to the terrible acting and line delivery, the distractingly bad line-dubbing, and the insultingly awful use of effects. The film deserves nothing higher than a 1/10, and I highly recommend skipping it.\n\nIf I could recommend a movie where a group of kids are detectives, I would recommend films like The Goonies, A Series of Unfortunate Events, or The Adventures of Tintin--you can never go wrong with any one of these titles.",

      "reviewBody": "French sex symbol Brigitte Bardot occasionally alternated her standard titillating vehicles with films of greater substance (though, invariably, she was still required to shed her clothes!) often helmed by a top name within her native cinema – notable examples being Claude Autant-Lara&apos;s LOVE IS MY PROFESSION (1958), Julien Duvivier&apos;s THE WOMAN AND THE PUPPET (1959; the only one I have not watched, since it seems not to be available in an English-friendly version – but, of course, I am familiar with the three other adaptations of the Pierre Louys source material, as well as owning the novel itself!), the film under review (sharing disc space with the first-mentioned title on the copy I watched, after acquiring one on which the English subtitles did not work – that said, even here, translation for a slew of dialogue at a time is intermittently skipped – but, then, these are burnt-in on the print obtainable via &quot;You Tube&quot;!), Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s CONTEMPT (1963) – unquestionably the finest of the lot – and Louis Malle&apos;s A VERY PRIVATE AFFAIR (1962), VIVA MARIA! (1965) and the &quot;William Wilson&quot; episode from SPIRITS OF THE DEAD (1968). As for director Clouzot, this was his last mainstream film – since his next, &quot;Inferno&quot; (begun in 1964), would be aborted due to his poor health and a subsequent one, LA PRISONNERE (1968), was perhaps too &apos;specialized&apos; (read: extreme) to cater for other than &apos;underground&apos; audiences! For the record, I still need to watch his MANON (1949) and LES ESPIONS (1957) from the ones I own. \n\nTHE TRUTH – included in the all-time top 3,000 movies ranked by the &quot;Wonders In The Dark&quot; website – was the only title involving either to be nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar: incidentally, it is preceded by the Columbia logo and, apparently, was simultaneously shot in English as per contemporary posters!; for what it is worth, the film deservedly missed out to Ingmar Bergman&apos;s beautifully stark parable THE VIRGIN SPRING (1960) – even if they actually emerged joint winners at the Golden Globes! Anyway, what we have here is the trial of a crime of passion (with the star herself in the dock), the backstory of which is then seen in flashback – triggered off by the interrogations of various witnesses. Clouzot managed to rope in an impressive supporting cast for his plethora of characters: Charles Vanel as Bardot&apos;s practiced Defense Counsel, Paul Meurisse as the showy Prosecutor – incidentally, both these actors had already appeared together for Clouzot in one of his greatest works, DIABOLIQUE (1955) – and youngsters Sami Frey and Jacques Perrin among the uninhibited (what else?) protagonist&apos;s numerous lovers, the former being also the victim in the case.\n\nThe director&apos;s renowned clinical eye for detail is well in evidence throughout – but the film&apos;s two sections do not necessarily jell in this particular instance (perhaps tellingly, the 122-minute movie had as many as six scriptwriters assigned to it!). The narrative proper, then, seems to belong to the &apos;wasted youth&apos; trend kickstarted by Federico Fellini&apos;s I VITELLONI (1953); indeed, despite their highbrow aspirations (musician Frey juggles a relationship with Bardot and her &apos;saintly&apos; elder sister, all the while attempting to set up his own orchestra!), these singularly colourless personages come across as low-lifes more than anything else: the crime itself, followed immediately by the heroine&apos;s attempted suicide, is easily the standout here. Conversely, the backhanded tactics prevalent in the over-crowded courtroom lend much cynical enjoyment – thus countering the necessarily static nature of the cinematography during these sequences.\n\nStill, the film is considered as the one in which the star gave her best performance (she even won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar for it as Best Foreign Actress): though the events leading up to the night of the crime and where the real guilt lay (hence the title) are hotly debated by both sides, it is inconceivable to accuse Frey (who could hardly be blamed for lusting after Bardot) over her (whose feelings for him – whether genuine or merely to spite her &quot;square&quot; sibling – are never properly defined)which is perhaps why the trial ends abruptly as it does! In retrospect, the movie can be seen to have much in common with the afore-mentioned &quot;Inferno&quot; – whose troubled shoot was delineated in a feature-length documentary released in 2009 (after Claude Chabrol had already impressively refashioned Clouzot&apos;s original script for his own 1993 effort L&apos;ENFER).",

The middle part may be lacking a bit in pacing, but it is a minor quibble, since this, for my money, is a masterpiece. And it still looks great, with impressive set design and an abundance of atmosphere. The finale is simply sublime, and stays in the mind for a long time afterwards, one of my favorite movie moments of all time. A movie everyone should see."

How can any fan of British horror from the 1960s fail to be enticed by such a top line-up?\n\nAs it happens, Curse of the Crimson Altar is actually an OK film. It was critically mauled and failed to impress at the box office, but it has some enjoyable moments if you&apos;re prepared to forgive its rather dated feel. The story is unoriginal and bland, with a young antiques dealer visiting a spooky looking house in search of his missing brother, only to uncover a witchcraft cult. But there are still plenty of moments to savour, such as some deliciously over-the-top sacrificial rituals, plus expertly acted scenes between Karloff and Lee.\n\nThe lead character played by Mark Eden (eagle-eyed viewers may remember him as nasty Alan Bradley in the British soap Coronation Street) is a crashing bore, and is nowhere near as handsome as he clearly thinks he is. However, some of the more bizarre characters in this film are really well delineated and make the film worth watching at least once."

I mean that in a really good way. You see, way back when, before all this CG crap, filmmakers had to use ingenuity and talent to craft their films. They had to tell their story through... Well, telling a story.\n\nThis is not a film for anyone seeking a fast paced, mindless, mess. It&apos;s a film for hardcore sci fi junkies like myself, who grew up on Star Trek, The Outer Limits, and The Twilight Zone.\n\nIt&apos;s more about the story and characters than special effects.",

      "reviewBody": "Sara Matthews (Minka Kelly) is starting her freshman year of college at ULA. Upon arrival, she meets Tracy Morgan (Alyson Michalka), an avid party-goer, and Stephen Morterelli (Cam Gigandet), a drummer who plays in a band for a fraternity who later begins to date Sara. After a party at Stephen&apos;s fraternity house that lands Tracy drunk, Sara arrives back at her dorm late at night and meets Rebecca Evans (Leighton Meester), her new roommate, whose parents live only 20 minutes away and who is great at drawing portraits of people. Initially, the girls begin to bond very well as Rebecca learns more about Sara&apos;s life. Sara had an older sister, Emily, who died when Sara was nine. She keeps a necklace that belonged to Emily as well as her sister&apos;s name tattooed on her chest. \n\nShe also has an ex-boyfriend, Jason (Matt Lanter), who keeps calling her to try to get back together with her.The history behind their breakup is that Jason and Sara agreed to both go to Brown University or not, and when only Sara got a spot, she declined it and chose ULA. However, when Jason got accepted to Brown at the last minute, he accepted to go without Sara, reneging on their agreement. Against dorm regulations, the two girls secretly adopt a stray kitten which Sara found. As time goes on, though, Rebecca begins to become more obsessed with spending time with Sara and wants to have her all to herself. She is willing to keep at bay anyone who wronged Sara or who she thinks is stealing Sara away from her....\n\nThe Roommate is your run of the mill thriller. There is absolutely nothing new or original here. The film slowly builds up to reveal that a certain character is the &quot;bad guy&quot;, well, it builds up to reveal how bananas the character truly is because, you know from the beginning where each character stands, and then comes the action which is predictable and not very exciting. The acting wasn&apos;t bad although I wish Minka Kelly had a little more personality.She&apos;s great too look at but she&apos;s also somewhat boring. Leighton Meester did a fine job. All in all it&apos;s a decent little film, but I wouldn&apos;t waste my time on it.\n\n6/10"

Everything I mean everything is so subtle, calm and human that one falls in love with it. One can fell the joy and pleasure in self.\n\nDirection is yet again top notch and Mifune&apos; shows the world, again, that he is among the very best if not the best. Music needs special mention as it is the least bothered area in Kurosawa&apos;s movies. Every sub plot has its own density, cheers and insight into human social values. The way movie paces itself is brilliant. Kurosawa takes his time to establish his characters and once it is done emphasis shifted to story and sub-plots.\n\nOn moral grounds it teaches us all that humanity is the only sky above all humans and one must not forget this fact.\n\nAll technical aspects including camera handling, set designs, acting from supporting staff is very good. Wants to mention the acting of the little girl (I think Otoyo) is so close to life that it makes you believe of that.\n\nA must watch for everyone.\n\n9/10",

It&apos;s based on actual events, yet the story has all the right elements of a great action film.  Don Johnson&apos;s LA cop is up against tremendous odds, a renegade, a drunk, lonely, and yet an entirely likeable character.  Whether you like Johnson (the actor), or Frankenheimer (the director), or action films (the genre) in general, give this film a chance.  It&apos;s almost perfect.  Completely underrated by the scoring on this site.\n\n7.5 out of 10"

It stars Kirk Douglas, Simon Ward, Agostina Belli, Anthony Quayle and Virginia McKenna. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Erico Menczer.\n\nNuclear industrialist Robert Caine (Douglas) refuses to heed warnings that the Antichrist is closer to home than he ever could have imagined...\n\nCaine and Angel\n\nCasting aside the fact that it is a cash in on the success of the far superior The Omen, it simply isn&apos;t smart or good enough to make its own mark. Knowing what is going on in the first instance is not a great thing for the audience, it would be were the narrative strong enough to keep us on our toes, but it never is. The plot speeds along merrily following the same trajectory as expected; mysterious deaths, pregnancy, loads of ominous warnings, repeat sequence of doom and on to the unsubtle reveal in preparation for a less than satisfying ending.\n\nThe makers do try to add some salt to the satanic broth, such as having Douglas roam around naked in a feverish nightmare, and some moments are kinda fun in that tacky Italian/England production way, but the zip, the originality, is sorely lacking. Cast seem to be working off of a different screenplay to each other, though Douglas is at least working hard to make the duff regurgitation come alive. It looks nice on occasions, and it&apos;s fun for the wrong reasons, but its low standing reputation is fully justified and therefore near impossible to recommend to anyone but Kirk Douglas completists. 5/10",

I felt that VACANCY was a film I&apos;d seen a hundred times before, and the same can be said for this low budget sequel which takes the form of a prequel set in another motel.\n\nThe story is very predictable and aimed at the torture porn market. A travelling group of three teenagers end up staying at a remote motel (is there any other type?) and fall foul of a group of weirdos who decide to make a snuff film. There are no shocks or surprises here, and the writing is merely perfunctory. The characters act dumb and stilted, and the worst thing is that there&apos;s no sense of empathy; you never care as to who lives or dies.\n\nAgnus Bruckner (THE WOODS) is the typical pretty blonde heroine but her character is severely underwritten to the point that the villains are more interesting than the supposed protagonists. The direction is insipid and uninspired and despite the plentiful chase sequences there isn&apos;t an exciting moment in the whole movie. Can&apos;t say I&apos;m too surprised...",

It is filmed in color, and while it doesn&apos;t have the classic look of black and white &quot;Hard Days Night&quot;, the script is better, and the Beatles appear more relaxed acting. The music is very good. Ringo, often in the background during in concerts and on recordings, proves he is the best actor of the Fab Four. Paul, John and George come across the screen as genuine and charismatic. &quot;Help!&quot; is filmed in different locations as well, which add to the film&apos;s quality.  To me, the Beatles are the greatest rock group in history. Before there was MTV, there was &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;. Nothing in music can top that.",

I&apos;ll just say that the ending is left open ended. That works really well for some movies but it kind of bothered me in this case. I was too worried about what the outcome would be to be really satisfied by the ending.\n\nThere was a really bad decision made by the distributors to make the gangsters talk with a New York Mafia style speech pattern. I got really tired of this and switched it to Korean with English subtitles. Sadly even the subtitles are written this way. It wasn&apos;t as annoying as the audio though.\n\nThe first two thirds of the movie was great but the last third was only okay.",

It&apos;s almost a full circle story, everyone looked awesome, Sneha did a wonderful job seeing as this is just her second movie (and she acted much better than in Lucky). I think anyone should watch it, however if you ONLY like chick flicks, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it. It is not like Veer Zaara or Rang De Basanti, so if those are the ONLY types of movies you like, I wouldn&apos;t think you would like this movie. Personally, I like any good movie with a good plot and good/hot actors. Like I said, the actors, especially the leads, looked very good, the plot was interesting and unique, and the overall movie was gripping and entertaining. Many people probably said that there are some adult only ideas in it, but those are easily overshadowed and they are not too much for say a 10 year old to watch. Again, if you are home on a rainy Friday/Saturday night, and you are looking for an entertaining, griping, original, unique, and overall amazinggggg Hindi film, watch Aryan. I am almost positive that if you fit the basic mindset I described, you will not regret watching this movie.",

CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is the granddaddy of course, and JAWS the milestone against which all over movies have been judged/attempted to rip off over the past thirty-plus years. AQUANOIDS is somewhere between the two plot-wise, as humanoid-type creatures kill surfers and bathers at a beach, but there the resemblance ends. This is no-budget filmmaking at its very worst, utterly devoid of talent and interest and only worth watching to see how worthless it really is. The hardest thing to like about this film is the camera, which looks little better than your average home video; the shot on video format works against it, lessening the experience against other, better B-movies of the past.\n\nA number of those films are referenced by characters in one SCREAM-like post-modern conversation, giving away the fact that the filmmakers are fans of this sub-genre. It&apos;s a shame they couldn&apos;t do anything with the tired script and awful execution. The creatures are barely seen, and boast rubbishy PREDATOR-style vision; the attacks involve laughable gore effects and one rip-off &quot;monster birth&quot; sequence. The jokes are flat and the acting awful, and brief nudity does nothing to keep you watching. The film&apos;s so cheap that even the guns rarely fire and explosions are effected via some lame CGI work. As the leading bimbo, Laura Nativo is attractive enough, and strangely resilient to the perils of the poor script, but she can&apos;t save this wishy-washy monster flick from being a total disaster.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; is a western from 1962, an era when this genre was suffering changes. If you are to judge the movie from the plot outline you might consider it to be an old fashioned western, but this is not the case here. This aspect can be noticed from the beginning, when the character of Jack Burns (Kirk Douglas) is introduced. He is a lone cowboy, traveling across the land on his horse, caring little about tomorrow. He seems to be out of place in the modern world and this modern world is hostile to him and his old ways. \n\nOne of the strengths of the movie is that it has a well developed central character. Kirk Douglas manages to create a believable cowboy, one that is stuck in the past refusing to acknowledge that the world has changed and he needs to adapt. Jack Burns is indeed a lonely cowboy because his way of seeing things is not shared by the others. The film also has the advantage of having a good screenplay, written by Dalton Trumbo (&quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Papillon&quot;), one of the best screenwriters of his time.\n\nThis was Kirk Douglas&apos; favorite movie of his own and you can surely tell that because he gives here one of his best performances. The acting is generally good, the roles of Walter Matthau and Gena Rowlands being worth mentioning. You can also check out George Kennedy in one of his early roles, as the brutish deputy Guttierez.\n\nThe movie may have its flaws, but it is definitely worth seeing by everyone. Due to its style and content the film also marks a transition from classical westerns to modern ones, so fans of the genre should not miss it.\n\nMy rating: 7,5/10",

      "reviewBody": "William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he&apos;s tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.\n\nClint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture, the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West.\n\nIt&apos;s striking that the makers here have lured us in to being firmly on Munney&apos;s side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood&apos;s part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney&apos;s obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way lay the bad guys - in fact salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it&apos;s with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with.\n\nIt&apos;s not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is one of the critical characters on show, this even though we didn&apos;t expect that to be the case. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derring-do heroics, gunslingers with a glint in their eye who deal death as some sort of heroic encore. This gives Unforgiven an excellent sleight of hand, for this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions and it&apos;s not controversial to say that this is indeed a good thing.\n\nEastwood is greatly served by the actors around him, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman (winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before!), Rubinek, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman&apos;s win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot; Daggett, Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction, Best Picture, Best Editing and it was nominated in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green&apos;s cinematography, which now, in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema, can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the Western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes.\n\nUltimately though, Unforgiven is a lesson in adroit film making, where across the board it works so well. Why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre inside out, he was after all the sole flag bearer for practically 25 years. He learnt from his peers, and thus Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark. An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema, regardless of being a genre fan or not. 10/10",

Her chemistry with Steven St. Croix (playing her secret agent husband) is evident and of course her sexiness impressive.\n\nMany other busty beauties like Veronica Rayne, villainess Nicole Sheridan and Audrey Bitoni flesh out the cast in a silly story of foiling terrorists in the Middle East, obviously shot on California locations.\n\nWorth checking out, especially now that such well-crafted, larger scale Adult features are no longer made."

Presenting the questionable back alley living conditions for slum kids was pretty harsh for moviegoers back then, but they were won over by the sympathetic group of kids working to solve the crime, where their lovable janitor was unjustly put to prison. Whether Bjarne and Astrid Henning-Jensen was inspired by the British Hue and Cry from Ealing Studios the same year I do not know, but the theme of describing hard living conditions was a natural theme for them to handle. The year before they had successfully released Ditte Menneskebarn set in the countryside, and now they turned to the harder concrete jungle. The villain actor in the film got so unpopular, that people shouted at him in the streets. In those days actors were unfortunately looked upon as more closely connected to their film roles than nowadays.",

My only problem with the film was the rather absurd off camera narration by the horse.

I been a Adam sandler fan since i was a kid! His movies always makes me feel good even if it were a flop film! But this film is something different! Specially when it comes to soundtracks! This movie has some of the amazing 80&apos;s songs on their track lists! The cameo of steve buscemi was one the best part of the film! Also the climax scene made me cheer like a kid lol!

Really painful to think of how bad the situation is in Assam, but more so because how heartless some people can be. And all of this - poverty, selfishness, greed is all one vicious cycle from which there seems to be no escape.\n\nActing and direction is perfect.

      "reviewBody": "This movie is currently playing in Paris as &apos;Happy End&apos;, hence my summary. Tautou has great presence and luminosity, no question, and equally obvious is that she has the makings of another Audrey Hepburn. But this isn&apos;t it. Someone has obviously seen the grosses on Breakfast At Tiffany&apos;s and figured, okay, let&apos;s do another adorable kook in Manhattan, let&apos;s have another writer manque become enamored of her and write about her successfully. Okay, it may be dated by now but Breakfast at Tiffs had STYLE. How else could they get away with making Hepburn WORSE than a hooker, a hooker who took money from guys on the tacit understanding that she would come across later and then powder via the powder room. True, they were more up front with the George Peppard character, he WAS a gigolo any way you sliced it, but they could get away with contriving a WHOLESOME romance between two slightly sleazy people because of the Style with which it was done. It was a pity there was no believably chemistry between Hepburn and Peppard but given that Peppard was a graduate of the Forestry Commission School of Acting that was always going to be a problem and given that Hepburn actually married a pygmy Redwood in the shape of Mel Ferrer, she couldn&apos;t complain. In this one, Tautou is cast as the adorable kook, French style, come to Manhattan to make it as an actress. She is reduced, however, not only to cleaning toilets but also sleeping and peeing outside the house of Justin Therouze (who he?), a would-be leading man clearly destined to go the same way as Nathalie Nattier. There would be more sexual chemistry between Golda Meir and Yasser Arafat than these two mismatched lovers. See it if you like Tautou, the camera loves her, but that&apos;s the best you can say for it. 3/10"

The promoters were pleased (I&apos;m sure) that one of the many names on the venue actually appeared and entertained! Cedric is a real LADIES man. He is always smiling and the attention is received with positive feedback. He was the life of the not so organized event. He could have walked but, he knew there was much disappointment in the air with all the no-show names on the venue at Kartuche night club in Jacksonville. Some like me paid $175.00 for VIP passes that were entry to An upstairs room filled with herbal essence in the air! An area Cedric and Pimpen Ken did not enter! Cedric saved the show by taking over and handled it like the PRO Entertainer that he is. Despite the no show names of various artists and players scheduled to appear. The man has it going on. It&apos;s no wonder he is so loved. The life he leads is that of a respectful man who cares about all of his fans! He is a top notch fun guy to KICK-IT with. I had my digital camcorder and got a lot of good footage of the camera friendly ENTERTAINER- My kids are really excited about all the great stuff I got on camera. We will cherish the recorded footage of a real down to earth CEDRIC &quot;THE LADIES MAN&quot; ENTERTAINER! All his movies are GREAT and will be watched for many years to come by his adoring fans! Barber Shop is my favorite I think- THANKS CEDDIE! Jodi Chambers-Wilson Jax Bch., Florida"

      "reviewBody": "In New York, the elder employee of the post-office Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) has a rampage and kills a client, shooting him with a Luger. The rookie reporter of the Daily News Tim Boyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) follows the detectives that are investigating the case and they find the valuable head of the statue Primavera in his wardrobe. Tim decides to interview the catatonic Hector, and out of the blue, he starts talking about the 92o Division &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; in Tuscan, Italy, in World War II. Hector and three other black soldiers - 2nd Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), Sergeant Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy) and the slow Private First Class Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller) – cross a river but his company is destroyed by the German soldiers. While trapped in a village, Train rescues the eight year-old boy Angelo Torancelli (Matteo Sciabordi), who survived a massacre in St. Anna village, and become connected to each other. Along the days, the platoon interacts with the villagers and Hector discloses a story of prejudice and betrayal in times of war. \n\nIn &quot;Miracle at St. Anna&quot;, director Spike Lee uses his traditional flag to disclose the situation of the black American soldiers in Italy, and how they were treated like second rate soldiers. I did not know that they have this type of treatment, and I was surprised why this theme had not been explored yet by other filmmakers. This movie is very engaging, and my only negative remark is the too long running time (160 minutes). My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Milagre em St. Anna&quot; (&quot;Miracle at St. Anna&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "The Beat That My Heart Skipped has the pulse of a major film, a certain energy that pulls you in, makes you interested in what it&apos;s doing. Its director, Jacques Audiard, gives one the impression that his is a big-league talent; there&apos;s a hum to his images that recalls Inarritu, without quite the same manic intensity, and for a brief moment or two puts one in mind of Scorsese, particularly GoodFellas (an early bar-fight scene recalls the dreamy, fixed-in-time feeling of some of Scorsese&apos;s violence). His lead actor, Romain Duris, has something of the young De Niro&apos;s quality of pent-up violence and greasy charm, but leavened by a more intellectual, less visceral Europeanness. Like Scorsese and De Niro in Taxi Driver, Audiard and Duris conspire to create a memorable study of a low-life seeking to emerge from the slime, though this time the low-life is armed with talent and confidence, and seems maybe capable of turning his dire situation around.\n\nThe low-life, Thomas Seyr, is a real-estate broker who&apos;s involved in all sorts of shady business deals; he and his slimy partners, Fabrice (Jonathan Zaccai) and Sami (Gilles Cohen), spend much of their time chasing squatters out of the buildings they&apos;ve procured (planting rats in their room is a favorite tactic), and trying to work their way around government housing regulations (when a group of homeless come to take up residence in one of their tenements they hurriedly smash everything, rendering the rooms uninhabitable; the script seems to be taking advantage of certain sore social issues here). Thomas, a button-man who happens to sometimes work in an office, was born to this kind of work; his father, Robert (the marvelous Niels Arestrup), is also involved in less-than-legitimate enterprise, and sometimes calls upon Thomas to take care of unpleasant business (like beating people up who refuse to pay). Thomas, however, has an unexpected artistic side; his deceased mother was a concert pianist, and one day while driving around the city he encounters her old manager, Fox (Sandy Whitelaw), who encourages him to return to his study of the piano, which he has nearly given up. This awakens in Thomas some latent ambition, a desire to escape his sleazy circumstances; he re-commits himself to his art, which leads him to the door of a recent Chinese immigrant, Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham), who tutors him, somewhat awkwardly as she speaks no French and he no Chinese. Thomas&apos;s less-than-honest life has saddled him with numerous obligations however, ones it will be difficult to leave behind.\n\nThe movie&apos;s theme is a familiar one: the impossibility of entirely escaping one&apos;s past, especially when one is still actively engaged in living the life that has caused one to have a shady past in the first place. Rather than deal with this in some abstract way, Audiard tackles the theme organically; we see what a bundle of unspent nervous energy Thomas is, and realize how his essential personality, his craziness, is the thing that really keeps him from being a pianist instead of a thug. This is not a story of fate being for or against anyone; it&apos;s not some cosmic force that keeps Thomas from leaving behind his old life but his own nature, and that of the people around him, especially his father, who is fundamentally a coward and needs Thomas to take care of things for him. Thomas&apos;s artistic endeavors are hindered by his inability to focus himself; he can&apos;t sit still for a second, and when he plays, the frustration drives him to hammer the keys like he should be able to beat a tune out of the instrument the same way he beats money out of people who owe. His personality is all jagged edges, and what he needs is to smooth them out, to reign in his impulses, his anger. This makes his introduction to Miao Lin all the more fortunate, for she has the patience of a saint, the quiet firmness needed to help tame his immature nature, to bring his fires under control. Romain Duris gives a live-wire performance as Thomas, something reminiscent of the Mean Streets De Niro, and that other great seventies sleaze-ball actor Warren Oates. He&apos;s basically an overgrown kid; he seems like his system is always pumped full of sugar (or maybe something stronger), and he has no inhibitions whatsoever which makes him a kick to be around, yet there&apos;s something doomed about him, the quality of a ticking time-bomb. Thomas might be a fun guy and a loyal friend (his loyalty is one of his failings), but you just know that sooner or later life is going to blow up in his face.\n\nAudiard and writing partner Tonino Benacquista have smoothly transplanted the plot of James Toback&apos;s &apos;70s cult item Fingers (which starred Harvey Keitel), and tweaked it to make it work in modern-day France. The pair seem to have an affinity for rough-edged-but-lovable characters coming under the influence of tender-but-firm women; their earlier film, Read My Lips, dealt with a similar situation, but was more straightforwardly a thriller, and didn&apos;t seem as refined either narratively or thematically as The Beat That My Heart Skipped. Audiard is a fantastically assured director, able to infuse a scene with energy without resorting to empty stylistics, and able to elicit dynamic performances that never edge into showiness. Audiard has a feel for the natural energies his actors give off; he taps into Duris&apos;s nervous charm, the nagging inadequacy of Niels Arestrup as Thomas&apos;s nuisance of a father, the radiant stillness of Linh Dan Pham as Miao Lin. This is one director who makes good movie-making seem easy, rather than making it seem hard on purpose so people will appreciate it more. Add Audiard to the list of modern directors whose next film is a must-see"

But if you want to experience real awfulness, then watch a german one like this one, although it gets a bit better towards the end. Unconvincing entertainment to say the least. As comedy the movie is average at best, I suppose it may be better suited for children.\n\nHere to see Liselotte Pulver I concede she gave a good acting performance in this lightweight comedy within the given context. A pretty appearance for sure, here in the figure of a kind of amazone. But my guess is, she had too many of those lightweight comedy appearances to be able to get out of them finally for more serious and challenging roles. A pity.",

The talent assembled for this production is why the film withstands the test of time and makes Dead End a movie which I never get tired of viewing. Greg Toland&apos;s cinematography is masterful. Max Steiner&apos;s musical score is brilliant. He perfectly blended the feel of a fast paced urban theme which then becomes a beautiful and dramatic orchestral piece. Max Steiner had a real genius for bringing the right mood to whatever the film demanded. Of so many brilliant Steiner scores, I find this to be among his finest. William Wyler&apos;s direction is awesome, as always. I particularly like the constant background flow of pedestrians going about their day throughout the entire picture. The movie&apos;s cast is stuffed with talent. Character actors like Marjorie Mane and Esther Howard fill small segments with memorable scenes. Claire Trevor&apos;s portrayal of a sweet girl who became disillusioned and wound up as a prostitute, is poignant while remaining gritty and realistic. The Dead End Kids are great throughout the movie. Ward Bond brings a plus to the movie in his role as the upscale apartment&apos;s doorman. I like Allen Jenkins and think no other actor was better suited to play the sidekick to Bogart&apos;s character as the prodigal gangster, returning to his old neighborhood. Dead End is one film that has countless elements to enjoy. The level of talent on both sides of the camera keep me watching it over and over again.",

      "reviewBody": "Thought I reviewed this the other day, but apparently, that never posted. This is probably Deanna Durbin&apos;s best effort. She is most natural in the role; one suspects that the director brought out the closest expression of the real girl, here. It gains further power from the remarkable performances of a strong supporting cast. For example, the Baker--played by a well known supporting figure in movies over a couple of decades, also seems most natural here, compared to any other role, in which this reviewer has seen him. His story nephews, here, are far more natural, far better developed than they were in a W.C. Fields movie released in the same era. So too, are other familiar performers from the same era. Was Deanna, the Director, or a combination, the spark that brought out the best in almost everyone? Who can say. But the movie, on a modest budget, perhaps, communicates real joy to the viewer--real cinema magic, that has held up for me from the time I saw it first (seven times) at age 6 1/2 and 7, till I bought DVD&apos;s for myself and some other members of my family, within the past year.\n\nIt was my favorite movie in 1941. Viewed again, frequently, over the past seven months, it remains my favorite movie. (And that despite the fact that I am usually not that great a fan of musicals!)",

      "reviewBody": "This film, like many others of the late 70s and 80s went unnoticed and stays a mystery for most of the Bollywood horror lovers, as most of them understand the horror domain with the name of a few successful flicks like Jaani Dushman, Band Darwaza, Purana Mandir, Veerana and many others that found their way to the theaters. Andhera, unlike most of its predecessors is a suspense-thriller, and takes many turns to imprint the impending horror. The film has a fairly impeccable storyline, strong enough to keep the viewers bound to their seats.\n\nTwo young men Deepak and Surendra are driving a vintage car on the road. They happen to see a car that&apos;s speeding up. The speeding car belongs to a dreaded gangster Ranjeet. Deepak and Surendra beat Ranjeet in the rash race and Ranjeet is impressed by Deepak&apos;s driving and asks him if he can be his chauffeur. Deepak doesn&apos;t pay attention to Ranjeet&apos;s offer at the moment, but soon finds that his brother Surendra hasn&apos;t submitted the examination fees and may be hence debarred from the examination. Deepak wants to help his brother and goes to Ranjeet for help. He tells Ranjeet that he is ready to work for him. Ranjeet in turn gives Deepak some advance, and thus destiny brings two of them together. Surendra scores good marks in the exams and soon applies for Police service. His dream comes true, when he passes the tests and is called for training.\n\nRanjeet often travels abroad and runs his international racket of smuggling and other illegal activities. He is assisted by few white-collared men, who are his business partners. They are 9 or 10 in number. During Ranjeet&apos;s one such absence, Deepak and Asha fall in love. Their relationship is objected by Ranjeet&apos;s partners. Since they don&apos;t dare say anything against Asha, they insult Deepak and tell him that love between rich and poor dies out with dire consequences. Deepak and Asha overlook the warning signs and choose to remain free-spirited love birds. After few days Ranjeet returns and discovers that Asha is pregnant. His partners tell him about Asha&apos;s ongoing affair with Deepak. A hostile and enraged Ranjeet summons Deepak to his saw mill and questions him about his intentions. Deepak simply says that everything happened unintentionally, but now that it has happened, he is ready to accept Asha and spend his life with her. Ranjeet is seeking a blind revenge. He disgraces Deepak and knocks him down unconscious. When Deepak regains his senses, he is horrified to see himself tied to a log, that is soon about to be flanked apart by the saw. Deepak tries to make Ranjeet understand but Ranjeet is simply seeking revenge and considers Deepak&apos;s punishment necessary to reclaim his lost honor. Deepak&apos;s hands are cut and he is thrown in a sewer pipe.\n\nIn the subsequent scenes, Deepak&apos;s deplorable and pitiable conditions are shown. His ailing mother is unable to support two of them. Deepak doesn&apos;t want to share all this with Surendra, thinking that Surendra would come to them leaving behind the golden path of his career. In a memorable scene Deepak is so helpless that he is unable to eat a crumb of bread from his own plate and a stray dog enjoys his meal. Soon Deepak&apos;s ailing mother is subjected to intense mental torture by the house owner, who makes fun of their pathetic condition and demands rent. Deepak&apos;s mother is ill but wants to support her family and so does handy jobs for her neighbors. The neighbors, however not so good, keep taunting Deepak and his mother on their misfortune. Deepak is also manhandled by some of the village folks on Holi. Unable to bear the bad times, Deepak&apos;s mother goes to Ranjeet for help. Ranjeet is nowhere to be seen, but Deepak&apos;s mother is ridiculed and badly insulted by Ranjeet&apos;s partners, who also try to seduce her. A bewildered Deepak arrives there and seeks truce but Ranjeet&apos;s partners drive him and his mother out. The same night Deepak&apos;s mother commits suicide. Next day, Deepak finds her dead body and also a bottle of poison lying on the floor. He cries a helpless cry. The same Day Surendra comes back from his training and is shocked to find himself in a highly grievous situation. Deepak, however keeps things to himself. When Surendra asks about the train of events, Deepak simply says &apos;There was darkness everywhere, and the same darkness swallowed all of us.&apos; \n\nNow the real horror begins, Ranjeet&apos;s partners are now being stalked by an unknown assaulter who is giving them dreadful deaths with his mysterious long fangs and claws as hard and sharp as steel. The death sequences are not quick and induce much horror. Some of the death scenes are specially memorable because they capture jinxed images of the setting Sun and are sepia tinted. Such color patterns remind me of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I am forced to remember a Chainsaw Wielding Leatherface! Andhera can&apos;t truly be compared with TCM, I am just talking about few scenes that give you somewhat parallel feelings. The storyline is very tight and doesn&apos;t go astray and one can easily speculate the impending horrors that may arise from someone&apos;s misfortunes. We also see the hypocrisy of so called &apos;big wheels&apos; of the society who themselves are engaged in all the illegal activities but consider &apos;love&apos; as an illegal or unsocial act. I really don&apos;t understand how such people draw a borderline between good and bad. I like this flick because of its enjoyable nature. I don&apos;t consider someone&apos;s misfortunes enjoyable, I consider those horrors enjoyable, which are inflicted upon the wrongdoers. I would like to say this to every ardent Bollywood horror fan, &quot;Find this flick somewhere! You won&apos;t be disappointed.&quot;",

It has an acceptable opening sequence, kind of comic in nature, and is followed by a weirdly comic (but infectious) opening credits song. However, just about all of what follows is done in a very serious tone. I could have lived with that change in tone had this seriousness been well done, but it really isn&apos;t. What follows is a rapid introduction of new characters and motivations that had me downright confused. It also didn&apos;t help that there is almost no action until the climatic sequence, which contributes heavily to the movie&apos;s main flaw of being extremely boring. Even if you are a fan of George Hilton, this is one pasta western that you&apos;d be better off skipping."

American promoter Max O&apos;Hara (Robert Armstrong) persuades the girl to bring her ape to America to take part in his show. You can pretty much guess how this will go wrong even if you haven&apos;t seen King Kong.\n\nFirst big role for Ben Johnson as a cowboy who falls for Moore. He&apos;s pretty wooden here but then again he was a fairly wooden actor throughout his career. He does his usual John Wayne, Jr. routine. Lots of &quot;Yassir&quot; and &quot;Ah reckon&quot; type stuff. Robert Armstrong plays a role very much like Carl Denham from King Kong, although a little more comedic. Terry Moore is more Helen Mack than Fay Wray. That is to say she&apos;s cute but not much screen presence.\n\nRe-teaming of many of the King Kong team for a story that is very similar to that film, although different enough to keep this from being considered a remake. The story is mostly kid stuff and fluff but cute nonetheless. The Willis O&apos;Brien/Ray Harryhausen special effects alone are worth checking this movie out.",

What provides the greatest pleasure in the film are the performances of Sizemore and Fenn, who are both terrific.\n\nTom Sizemore is a fast-talking, quick-witted cop who is deep undercover as a freelance hood &apos;recruited&apos; for an old-fashioned bank job, and whether he is quoting Jack Kerouac while seducing Fenn, savoring a high-stakes poker game, or trying to explain to his partner that he&apos;s not on the &apos;take&apos;, he dominates the screen each time he appears.\n\nSherilyn Fenn is a marvel. After surviving early roles best remembered for her frequent nude scenes (TWO MOON JUNCTION, MERIDIAN), she has matured into an actress of some range and a remarkable sensitivity. When she describes men&apos;s usual &apos;pick up&apos; lines (&quot;Nice dress...It would look great on my floor&quot;), there is a world-weariness and pain in her voice that is totally honest. At 37, she has achieved a balance between her still breathtaking beauty and growing dramatic skills that, in a &apos;kinder&apos; world, would provide her better roles in more than just &apos;Indie&apos; films.\n\n$WINDLE isn&apos;t a great film, but catch it, anyway, for Sizemore and Fenn. You won&apos;t be disappointed!"

      "reviewBody": "Does your other half have a hobby? Something that keeps them out of mischief perhaps. Out of your hair for a while. Or maybe something you find you can both share? Gentle-natured Daniel Bauer has a hobby that takes him pleasantly to another level. It gives his work environment a whole new purpose. He lives in a world where his boss makes fun of him. He feels disempowered at his job (as a gardener in the Botanics). He doesn&apos;t have many friends. So at first it&apos;s a worry whether his (rather conservative and rather gorgeous) new girlfriend will find out. She&apos;s a pretty clever cookie. But devoted to Daniel. Then again, this hobby thing can be a bit more unusual than sorting a stamp collection dressed in someone else&apos;s suspenders.\n\nDaniel&apos;s hobby is killing people. Calmly. Unfussily. With the same detachment as someone putting the washing out.\n\nHe starts off just dropping rocks off a motorway bridge. Nice satisfying crash. (He walks on nonchalantly.) Then Daniel sees a bloodthirsty hunt. A poor little fox is killed. He steals a gun from the unlocked boot. At work a bit earlier the next day. Catch a morning jogger. Right between the eyes.\n\nThis goes on for a while. It&apos;s an itch he likes to scratch. Nothing personal.\n\nDaniel&apos;s new girlfriend, a blonde co-worker named Jana, sees everything she wants in this shy young man. He at first rejects her, unable to handle the first date scenario. But eventually he gives in. It&apos;s a nice one up on the boss when the two of them are seen together. Daniel keeps the hobby secret. And he&apos;s discreet. Bumping off a botanics visitor here, tending the flower beds there. As if nothing unusual is happening. Daniel and Jana go on a short romantic break. Nice pastoral stuff, a romp that helps the pacing of the movie and also cramps his style. Just like the police patrolling the gardens now. Daniel soon feels poorly with the pressure. Jana takes time off work to care for him. And moves in with him. What devotion! I did enjoy Distanz. The casually conducted murders have a certain shock value. And Ken Duken, who plays Daniel, is almost a young Kevin Bacon. His character perfectly fits the psychological profile delineated in Copycat, where Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) links the apparent &apos;normality&apos; of serial killers with the invisibility afforded by white masculinity. The gory tabloid idea of a deranged serial killer is very distant from this. Distant from such cold-blooded reality.\n\nDaniel, although sexually active, is a very repressed man. The character still epitomises to a large extent the non-phallic sexuality of serial killers going back to films like Peeping Tom and Psycho. A feminist reading might wish to ponder parallels between Daniel&apos;s desire to defile his victims (by killing them) and his attitude towards Jana. Both are convincing expressions of how he needs to define himself by replacing his sense of emptiness with a sense of superiority. And power over others. The film draws us into identifying with him, to enjoying a scopophilic pleasure as he goes where we wouldn&apos;t. We are like voyeurs as the camera takes us behind the bushes where he, unseen by anyone else, aims the rifle. The victim is in our sights. The audience wills him to &apos;get away with it.&apos; A weak point for me is when Jana decides to stay with him after discovering his gruesome leisure pursuit. &quot;You have to stop doing this!&quot; she says. Which doesn&apos;t quite seem a strong enough statement from someone who&apos;s just discovered her bloke is murderously mad. Especially as she is not a Bonny &amp; Clyde girl and certainly no Natural Born white trash Killer. Just a nice, intelligent, respectable girl who works at the office. This heart (or loins) ruling the head doesn&apos;t quite convince in this case. Even if she is devoted enough to not turn him in, surely she wouldn&apos;t stay between his blood-tainted sheets? As a plot device, it could be forgiven in a less-than-believable box-office action thriller. But in such an otherwise stylish film it strikes a weak note. You might feel differently, of course. Be swept along. And, like Jana, forgive such apparent contrivance. Her attitude would make ideal wish-fulfilment in Daniel&apos;s warped world. But I didn&apos;t find enough evidence to suggest that I was watching a dream-projection of his fantasies. The naturalistic, verité style of Distanz seems to preclude such excuse.\n\nI find Distanz an interesting movie overall. I like the way it avoids overstatement and intrusive background music. And it displays some of the finer stylistic points of modern German cinema. But the genre is a limited one, and it is difficult for serial killer films to really stand out. Some of the best have been the freakishly unusual (Monster), the stylistically overpowering (Natural Born Killers), those heavy with double meaning (American Psycho), or ones focussing on the psychological battle between killer and detective (Silence of the Lambs, Basic Instinct). Distanz is a rather classier offering than, say, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. But it struggles to define itself in an increasingly overcrowded genre.\n\nThe competent directorial hand (this is a promising debut feature), the careful evocation of mood, and the well-honed lead performance hold attention throughout. Even if the movie doesn&apos;t quite hit the &apos;totally riveting&apos; highspot.",

      "reviewBody": "I can just picture how this movie came to be:\n\n&quot;So how else can we screw up our careers?&quot; \n\n&quot;I know! Let&apos;s take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!\n\n&quot;Perfect! We&apos;ll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey&apos;s original salary. We&apos;ll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!&quot; \n\n&quot;Brilliant! Let&apos;s put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!&quot; \n\nAnd really, that&apos;s what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it&apos;s original classic.\n\nNevertheless, if the movie didn&apos;t contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For all it&apos;s massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It&apos;s a good natured flick that really wants to scream out &quot;like me!&quot; but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.\n\nJamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It&apos;s too bad the character is wasted on this film, I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.\n\nThe plot is so much by the books, I won&apos;t bother to mention it here. It&apos;s all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.\n\nSave your money, this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel. Didn&apos;t dumb and dumberer teach them anything?",

There&apos;s also some minor nudity, just in case you thought a romantic comedy won&apos;t allow for such a thing. So while the movie tries to reach high, it never fully achieves that goal.

      "reviewBody": "Borat proves to be the Python of our generation. \n\nI say this as a die-hard Monty Python fan  not because the humour is on the same level or follows the same guidelines (in fact, the common ground is here is that it follows no guidelines)  but because both comedy teams mask their sketches in a feature film, passing them off as a story when it becomes glaringly clear that the latter is an elaborate pretext under which to have outrageous, absurdist and side-splittingly fun in a series of genius gags.\n\nYet for all of Borat&apos;s subsequent disorganisation and warped narrative, we are first served a gorgeously condensed introduction to our character in his village in Kazakhstan. This segment was possibly the biggest crowd-pleaser in my theatre and perhaps rightly so, for I would call it the film&apos;s goldmine in terms of sheer laugh-out-loud humour. Here we are introduced to Borat&apos;s sister (&quot;She is number-four prostitute in whole of Kazakhstan.&quot;), whom he kisses on the mouth, his main interests (ping-pong, sunbathing and &quot;watch ladies make toilet&quot;) as well as a wide variety of hilarious native Kazakhs. Undoubtedly the success of the introduction stems from a combination of novelty and a culture shock.\n\nOnce the sprawling surge of Kazakhstani culture subsides, Borat flies to New York City to make a movie-film about the glorious US and A. The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson&apos;s &quot;Everybody&apos;s Talking&apos; At Me&quot; and the film gets ambitious: it spoofs Jon Voight&apos;s incongruous cowboy character walking down Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy (1969). This I found a pleasant surprise, but the referential spoofs end here and the rest is all Sascha Baron Cohen  and we couldn&apos;t be happier.\n\nThe second half of Borat is arguably less compelling. It is hard to tell why, for the humour remains consistently good and there is an almost exponential stupidity with our Borat character as the sets out to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. I would not go as far as to say the novelty &quot;wears off&quot;, but we are a little more settled now and Borat has found his safe footing. Next, however, the film totally floors whatever safeness you may have with one of the most unspeakably graphic hotel room scenes I have ever seen. I won&apos;t give anything away, but rest assured that some viewers (*males*) will watch in horrified silence while others will literally cramp up from laughing so violently. I belong more to the latter category.\n\nAs Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people  members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews  all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Sadly, it was not always directed toward Borat (but most of the time) but toward some truly idiotic hick Americans. When I was informed the film used many candid takes, I can only hope the unreasonably creepy Jesus convention was *not* one of them.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)&quot; is a towering comedy achievement. It is apparent that Sascha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an anti-semitic, misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited, which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags, spoofs, bizarre one-liners and graphic jokes. The most fun I&apos;ve had in a theatre since...forever!!!\n\n9 out of 10",

It&apos;s slickly made and well acted, it&apos;s as slick or slicker than Gilling&apos;s Hammer films which suffer when compared to the perfectly crafted films of Terence Fisher done at the same time. He has his own style of writing and directing that does separate his work from the rest of Hammer in a unique way. So I was always wanting to see this final film.\n\nThere are few appearances of the Templars in this film and they are few and far between. The journey of the hero is to get to the spot his sister died where there is a Cross of the Devil. But it takes almost the entire length of the film to get there and people just talk and talk endlessly and when you are watching subtitles it&apos;s hard to even &quot;watch&quot; the nice scenery they travel through. The talk mostly is exposition about the interesting history of the Templars. But those stories all sound like they&apos;d make better more action filled films than this one. It&apos;s not the pace of the film that&apos;s slow it&apos;s the overly talking script and lack of much real &quot;incident&quot; in the film. There is some nice camera movement and the few wordless moments are effective. Few scares though there is a memorable sequence with a solitary eye emerging from the shadows. Frankly that&apos;s about as exciting as the middle part of this film gets. Again as you watch just expect very few Templars and that will help some. Nice music score but there isn&apos;t much sinister or scary action of score. One assumes Naschy&apos;s original script had less talk and more action. This isn&apos;t Gilling&apos;s worst film but it&apos;s not his best. Too bad he didn&apos;t get to make more films, but you have to hope if he had they&apos;d be more exciting than this one.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;There comes a moment when you look around waiting for the person in charge to help you and then you realize your the person in charge.&quot; After her father suffers a breakdown, Mona (Alba) becomes obsessed with math. Using it has an escape she becomes distant from reality until her mother kicks her out. After taking a job teaching math to elementary school kids she learns to grow up and help others. This movie started off very funny and entertaining then really started to drag. The ending was OK, very predictable though. The middle of the movie seemed to repeat itself and drag on and on and on. For those who like off beat quirky humor this is a movie for you. I would compare the humor to &quot;500 Days Of Summer&quot;, but not as funny. This did have some very touching moments in it, but overall this movie had the potential to be very good, but it never got what it needed. Overall, a good movie that could have been better. It was just missing something. I give it a C+.\n\nWould I watch again? - I don&apos;t think I will.\n\n*Also try - 500 Days Of Summer &amp; Music Never Stopped"

      "reviewBody": "Director Sam Mendes last movie showed a couple deteriorating right in front of our eyes in &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, and in a way he makes up for that depressing slog with &quot;Away We Go&quot;. The couple here are upstarts, two people with a baby on the way who for the first time find themselves wondering about where they fit in the world and what they&apos;ll be like as parents. They&apos;re hopeful, but you can see the fear plastered on their face. First time screenwriters (and husband and wife) Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida waste no time in making them two identifiable people, and in the way they survey life&apos;s odd, complicated, and wonderful little moments, &quot;Go&quot; never fails at being a funny, thoughtful and heartwarming little gem that you&apos;ll fall in love with.\n\nJohn Krasinski (The Office) and Maya Rudolph (Saturday Night Live) play Burt and Verona, a mid-thirties boyfriend-girlfriend (Verona has a marriage issue) who get the shock of their lives when Verona gets pregnant. Not only that but any roots they have in their little Connecticut town are about to be uprooted because Burt&apos;s parents (a funny Jeff Daniels and Catherine O&apos;Hara) are moving to Belgium a month before the baby is born. Having no reason to stay where they are, they pack up and take a road trip, stopping anywhere they know they might find a familiar face. Phoenix, Tucson, Madison, Montreal, and Miami are all marked for a trial period as the two try to figure out who and what they would like to raise their family around.\n\nIt&apos;s an odd blend of dealing with life&apos;s what-ifs and meeting a variety of broad characters. Allison Janney is the funniest of the broad, playing Verona&apos;s former boss Lily, an abrasive alcoholic who enjoys point-blank degrading her children and her crazy, paranoid husband, nicely played by Jim Gaffigan. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shows up later on as Burt&apos;s zen-like cousin who takes family closeness to a whole new level, i.e creepy. Mendes balances scenes like these perfectly with the richly written script. A scene between Verona and her sister (Carmen Ejogo) where the ushering in of new life forces them to confront the death of their parents, and another where Burt&apos;s brother (Paul Schneider), whose wife has just abandoned him and their young daughter, encourages Burt to think about the strength of his own bond with Verona have a rare power that speaks to the importance of family. There is a point where the interspersing of comedy and drama starts to get old but luckily a third act of genuine lessons and happy mediums lead to some of the movies best scenes.\n\nAnd these are star-making turns from Krasinski and Rudolph. He has a doofy charm that gets a couple good laughs but he also makes Burt a loveably doting and comforting boyfriend there for Verona no matter what. And Rudolph is a big surprise here as she turns in a performance of maturity, vulnerability, and depth. This type of performance is a long way from SNL. They are, for the most part, the straight-men to the quirky characters and are called upon to spend most of the movie&apos;s run-time just talking and they gel so well with each other that you really don&apos;t even mind. Ellen Kuras&apos; cinematography (rolling hills, sunrises, planes moving across glass window panes) and Alexi Murdoch&apos;s songs only increase the pleasure in this funny and effective indie rom-com.\n\nFor more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com",

      "reviewBody": "It is always great to see the circus setting in film, television and cartoons, and it is an exciting and nostalgic setting if also dangerous. Some films, television and cartoons handle the setting and its atmosphere better than others, with the atmosphere and spectacle often nailed but very variable in the story and writing departments. Another reason for seeing &apos;The Merry Circus&apos; was for completest sake, seeing the work of stop motion/puppet animation master Jiri Trnka.\n\n&apos;The Merry Circus&apos; is far from being one of his best and personally consider it one of his weaker short films. It is still good and charming and when saying that it is a lesser effort it is only because much of his output was very high quality and fascinating when it comes to how stop motion/puppet animation looked in his day. &apos;The Merry Circus&apos; nails the atmosphere and the visuals, but it is one of the Trnka efforts where the story is pretty wanting.\n\nElaborating more on this, the story is paper thin at best and often non-existent.\n\nAs a result &apos;The Merry Circus&apos; did tend to drag, it is only just a little over 10 minutes and could easily have been 5 or 6.\n\nHowever, what really makes &apos;The Merry Circus&apos; is the way it looks in the visuals. The visuals here are superb in all senses, at its best visual poetry, while the short may not be one of Trnka&apos;s best overall it&apos;s one of his best looking. It&apos;s fun and atmospheric to listen to as well.\n\nFurthermore, the circus atmosphere is very vivid, the excitement and danger of the setting perfectly captured. Really loved seeing the circus acts, which fascinated and enthralled, a major standout being the slack roping fish. The inhabitants look great and while the story may be little the personalities of the inhabitants and circus acts are big and colourful.\n\nIn conclusion, not great but definitely worth watching. 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I first noticed this film on YouTube in a series of videos that list &quot;scariest movie moments.&quot; One of the scenes selected was from this movie and since it sent a chill down my spine so I decided to give the rest of the film a chance. That&apos;s when my blood damn near froze.\n\nSeeing that &quot;Exorcist III&quot; is a third entry in a franchise in which the second film has a very low reputation and the fourth didn&apos;t exactly draw much noise probably gets many people to overlook this film. The fact is that it is the Exorcist label that works against it. This is not really an exorcist movie as the original source novel was similar in theme, but not a sequel to Blatty&apos;s &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; The exorcism scene was added in the middle of production and it feels slightly out of place with the rest of the film.\n\nHowever, it also provides an eerie element as the re-shot scenes has Jason Miller and the originally shot scenes had Brad Dourif and the final product cuts back between the two. It works in a creepy way, just watch and you&apos;ll understand. Though the film&apos;s best part is the incredible atmosphere. It is really something. Haunting music, dream sequences, and good mixture of the classic &quot;jump scare&quot; along with some brilliant &quot;quiet scares&quot; for lack of better word. The scene that drew me to this film is an almost update of the infamous &quot;spider-walk&quot; from the first &quot;Exorcist.&quot; It is a terrifically designed scene, among many I might add, so you begin to wonder why Blatty didn&apos;t direct more films? I am almost itching to see what else he could come up with on screen.\n\nThis is a thoroughly enjoyable and smart horror film with above average acting, writing, directing, and design as well as everything else. And it is best thought of as separate from the Exorcist series, just like the book was, even if it does include an exorcism. --- 8/10\n\nRated R for violent content/terror. Ages 13+",

      "reviewBody": "The film starts with a bawdy song unmistakably naughty and then follows ever so much suggestive but clever dialogue. There is wicked and mischievous goings-on in and around a beautiful home on the road between Paris and Avignon. This is where Denis Diderot (Vincent Perez) is compiling and printing his banned multi-volume encyclopaedia. My goodness! I had no idea that a 17th Century philosopher could have so much fun putting into print some of his thoughts and experiences.  &quot;If it&apos;s natural&quot; he says &quot;It must be good for you&quot;.  He not only says it, but practises it, and no woman seems safe from his ardent approaches.\n\nAmongst all the farcical nonsense, there is some heavy satire on the church&apos;s attitude to sex. exotic foods such as chocolate and caviare, musical scores (the pig organ is a delight) and banned literature.  Vincent Perez as Diderot plays the character superbly  wearing a delightful smile though not much else when he poses for his portrait by the beautiful Madame Therbouche, a so-called painter from Berlin though actually a spy arranged by the Cardinal.  Her mission is to locate the clandestine printing presses.\n\nThere is plenty of action in the film (and never a dull moment) as Diderot prances naked around the surrounding gardens much to the disgust of the Cardinal.  Much of the action is around the Cardinal who must be prevented from finding the printing presses.  This is easily arranged by recruiting as many ladies as possible to seek confession of their sins before the Cardinal.  Besides attending to his clerical duties, he seems not uninterested in their wickedness.\n\nFinally Diderot falls in love with Madame Therbouche as he seeks her assistance in the preparation of Volume X111. She agrees of course and why not?  The last volume is to be all about sensuality, a subject in which both of them are so well versed.\n\nAn absolute delight!",

The master of the tracking shot might have done so much more but this was his last completed movie.\n\nThe scenes are mostly well-directed and beautifully photographed but the main problem with &quot;Lola Montès&quot; is Lola. It is impossible for the viewer to understand how this plain, charmless woman (underplayed by Martine Carol) could seduce and inspire composers and kings. Where is the beauty, the sexiness, the vivacity of Lola? \n\nI am not asking for a documentary but the real life story of Lola is so much more interesting. I know that Ophuls is commenting on the downside of celebrity - Lola wants to be a star and ends up in a circus (if Ophuls made this today, Lola would appear in a TV &quot;reality&quot; show or sex tape) - but without a compelling central character the spectacle falls as flat as the cardboard cutouts of Lola.",

      "reviewBody": "Okuyama is an engineer whose face was horribly mutilated in a workplace accident. Feeling shunned by society and rejected by his wife, he shamefully hides his disfigurement behind layers of bandages. After consultation, a psychiatrist offers to make Okuyama a realistic prosthetic mask, to return some semblance of normality to his life. Okuyama accepts, despite the shrink&apos;s warning that the mask may alter his personality. Meanwhile, a similarly disfigured young nurse from Nagasaki travels to a seaside resort with her brother, where the depth of her disaffection with the uncaring world around her makes itself known in shocking and unexpected ways.\n\nBased on Kobo Abe&apos;s novel of the same name, Hiroshi Teshigahara&apos;s &apos;The Face of Another&apos; is a dark, intriguing drama examining notions of identity, appearance and personality, and how the three intersect. Abe&apos;s screenplay tackles these themes- as well as that of cultural identity- maturely and with great tact, while also retaining much narrative tension. In fact, if one wished to disregard the psychological and sociological aspects of the story entirely- interpreting the film simply as a horror with a lot of wordy dialogue- one could; and the impact of &apos;The Face of Another&apos; wouldn&apos;t be much diminished.\n\nIt is a rewarding experience, however, postulating on the psychological questions raised by Abe&apos;s narrative, specifically whether or not one&apos;s personality is influenced by one&apos;s looks, and the extent to which one&apos;s looks informs one&apos;s quality of life. It is commonly accepted that physical appearance does have a meaningful impact on people&apos;s life experiences and opportunities. Researchers like Daniel Hamermesh posit that the traditionally handsome and beautiful generally have an easier time of things than their less attractive counterparts. At the same time, according to the theory of facultative personality calibration, personalities develop in a way that match other genetic traits, so that one who is more handsome will be more assertive or confident, and vice versa.\n\n&apos;The Face of Another&apos; provokes contemplation around- and plays into- these ideas, as well as examining how Japanese cultural identity was irrevocably altered following WWII and the devastation of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Okuyama&apos;s loss of face and adoption of the mask suggests that one&apos;s face is not just a physical feature, but a means of communication with society and oneself. By losing this means of communication, Okuyama loses his connection to his original culture and sense of self. So too did the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima alter the face of Japanese society, ensuring that post-war Japan was- in some ways- indistinguishable from pre-war Japan. In this regard, the film suggests that identity- both personal and cultural- is fluid, and heavily influenced by external factors.\n\nThe film inspires rumination around these notions, whilst stunning with its visuals. Hiroshi Segawa&apos;s cinematography and shot construction is striking and strange, heightening the eerie tone of proceedings. His work, heavy in visual metaphor, lends sequences- such as a breath-taking, multi-masked crowd scene- an odd but undeniable power. Utilizing a wide variety of stylizations- including bizarre zooms, x-rays and jump cuts- he keeps things feeling consistently fresh, innovative and off kilter. This is only compounded by Arata Isozaki and Masao Yamazaki&apos;s surrealist art direction, as well as Yoshi Sugihara&apos;s assured, experimental editing, which holds everything together masterfully.\n\nOne would be remiss not to discuss the score from Toru Takemitsu, which fluctuates between the macabre and the mournful, while always remaining melodic. The main theme- entitled The Waltz- is particularly atmospheric and haunting, reflecting through it&apos;s bittersweet melody Okuyama&apos;s fragile psychological state. Furthermore, Taichiro Akiyama&apos;s sterling efforts crafting all the masks must be mentioned, as there are a great many throughout the picture and each one is spectacularly insidious.\n\n&apos;The Face of Another&apos; boasts a fine cast of actors all doing superlative work. Tatsuya Nakadai stars as Okuyama, bringing both sides of the fellow to life most efficaciously. Suppressing his characteristic charisma, he lays bare the crisis of personality Okuyama faces, creating a most memorable character in the process. Alongside him, Miki Irie showcases a great emotional perspicuity in her role as the disfigured nurse, stealing all the scenes she&apos;s in. Additionally, Mikijiro Hira consistently impresses as the psychiatrist and Machiko Kyo delivers a remarkably understated performance as Okuyama&apos;s wife- it&apos;s a pity she didn&apos;t have more screen time to further develop the character.\n\nA sad film in some regards, a tense one in others; Hiroshi Teshigahara&apos;s adaptation of Kobo Abe&apos;s novel &apos;The Face of Another&apos; has a lot to offer viewers. Featuring beautiful black and white cinematography from Hiroshi Segawa and a stirring score from Toru Takemitsu- as well as spellbinding art direction and tight editing- there is very little fault one can find with the picture. Powerfully acted and deftly directed throughout, &apos;The Face of Another&apos; is a macabre, melancholic masterpiece.",

He understands very well to show the audience the small things of life, that can be funny as well. Although nothing important or extraordinary happens in this movie, it is interesting for every minute. You won&apos;t find simple jokes and gags (like in a Zucker movie) in this film, but you will be fascinated about the subtle sense of humor of Loriot. The only thing to criticise is the very poor quality of scenery and camerawork what seems to be an effect of the low budget of this film. But I would consider &quot;Pappa ante portas&quot; (a German-Latin play on words that means &quot;Daddy in front of the door&quot; and is an allusion to the Latin figure of speech &quot;Hannibal ante portas&quot;) as one of the ten funniest German movies in the history of German comedies.",

      "reviewBody": "If Homer&apos;s mythical epic &quot;The Iliad&quot; is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen&apos;s 2004 epic &quot;Troy.&quot; In other words, don&apos;t expect any goofy &apos;gods&apos; or &apos;goddesses&apos; like Athena popping out of thin air because &quot;Troy&quot; is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.\n\nMore than that, &quot;Troy&quot; is arguably the best sword &amp; sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- &quot;Samson and Delilah,&quot; &quot;Spartacus,&quot; &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; &quot;Ulysses,&quot; &quot;The Viking Queen,&quot; &quot;Conan the Barbarian,&quot; &quot;Braveheart,&quot; &quot;Attila,&quot; &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; &quot;Gladiator,&quot; etc. -- &quot;Troy&quot; is superior. At the very least it&apos;s as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; and far edges out &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;Samson and Delilah.&quot; As for more recent sword &amp; sandal epics, like the overrated &quot;Braveheart&quot; or &quot;Gladiator,&quot; &quot;Troy&quot; blows &apos;em out of the water.\n\nRoger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of &quot;Troy&quot; is all wrong. Ebert&apos;s major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek &apos;gods&apos; &amp; &apos;goddesses&apos; and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film &quot;Ulysses,&quot; but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in &quot;Troy.&quot; His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer&apos;s myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).\n\nRegarding Brad Pitt&apos;s heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn&apos;t care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece&apos;s greatest warrior. No, he&apos;s not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he&apos;s fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from &quot;Hulk&quot;) is also great as Hector, Achilles&apos; Trojan counterpart, who&apos;s sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword &amp; sandal duel ever filmed.\n\nWhat&apos;s interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn&apos;t decide for whom to root. Maybe that&apos;s the point. Don&apos;t get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn&apos;t rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus&apos; wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the &apos;good guys&apos; or &apos;bad guys.&apos; They&apos;re just people at war, and in war there&apos;s no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.\n\nAs for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, &quot;the face that launched a thousand ships.&quot; Some have complained that she&apos;s too plain for the role, but I disagree. I&apos;m not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.\n\nI should point out that &quot;Troy&quot; was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, &quot;Troy&quot; is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome &amp; Coliseum scenes in &quot;Gladiator.&quot;\n\nAnother complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles&apos; comment that the &apos;gods&apos; envy people because we&apos;re mortal and &quot;Everything&apos;s beautiful because we&apos;re doomed.&quot; Thankfully, there&apos;s not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.\n\nJames Horner&apos;s score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; you&apos;ll love this one because it&apos;s just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector&apos;s showdown is magnificent.\n\nInterestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no?\n\nFINAL WORD: If you&apos;re in the mood for a sword &amp; sandal epic, &quot;Troy&quot; more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.\n\nGRADE: A+",

I wouldn&apos;t call this film a comedy at all, but that in itself is not a problem. The problem is that it is all very predictable and stereotypical: older lonely Westerner, desperate young Eastern European woman... blah-blah-blah, you name it. Yes, there were funny moments (mainly his meetings with other &quot;potential brides&quot;), but the whole picture is very bleak, just as the interior of the hero&apos;s house. Even Jan Decleir cannot rescue this film. You know in advance how it is going to end. You know exactly what the heroes are going to do next. Maria Popistasu is OK, but nothing extraordinary. And, most important, none of the heroes of this film deserves any compassion. In one word - boring.",

      "reviewBody": "NIGHT OF THE LEPUS is one of those movies that you simply have to see to believe. I am very glad that LEPUS has finally been officially released on DVD because for years, I have described it to fellow B-movie fans who have then accused me of making it up. Besides, I am now finally able to replace my bootleg DVD (recorded from foreign TV with Swedish or Norwegian subtitles, I&apos;m not sure which, running across the bottom of the screen) and enjoy this masterpiece the way it was meant to be seen.\n\nIn brief: Somewhere in the American Southwest, ranchers are losing their crops to hungry herds of Jackrabbits. A scientist, attempting to figure out a way to slow the reproduction rate of the rabbits, injects an experimental hormone into some test animals. One of the test rabbits escapes and begins mating with the local bunnies, resulting in a horde of giant killer mutant rabbits with a taste for human flesh. You CAN&apos;T make this stuff up, kids! From there it&apos;s long-eared, low budget mayhem of the highest order, with scenes of regular-sized bunnies rampaging through miniature Western towns (complete with dubbed-in squeals and roars on the soundtrack) and hungry bunnies (played by stuntmen in full body rabbit suits) attacking unlucky townspeople, until the military is called in to neutralize the threat. Anyone who makes it more than fifteen minutes into this movie without cracking up is a better person than I am. You can almost imagine Janet Leigh during filming, smoking cigarettes in between takes and asking DeForest Kelley &quot;What the hell are we doing in a movie about KILLER RABBITS? I worked with Alfred Hitchcock for cryin&apos; out loud! I am going to KILL my agent!&quot; I had pet rabbits growing up and never found them scary in the slightest. Maybe that&apos;s why I love this movie so much. To this day, I wonder if the studio person who green-lighted this project and allowed it to be made still had a job when his superiors saw the final product. Do yourself a favor and check out NIGHT OF THE LEPUS, an unjustly forgotten slice of early 70s drive-in cheese. You may love it, you may hate it, but I promise you, you will NEVER forget it!"

There&apos;s a plot: which concerns an invasion by alien insects who wish to turn Japan into a nest so they can spread their colonies all over. There are characters that are well-defined and interesting. There is suspense. There are realistic special FX, cool-looking monsters, and brutal kaiju battles. This film expertly shows Japan in panic and the effects of a kaiju on the country. It&apos;s also good to show how the military handles the situation. This film far surpasses the first movie in the series. Legion was a far more formidable villain than Gyaos. There are many classic scenes, including Legion&apos;s demise, Gamera getting covered with insects, and the destruction of Sendai. This can be either a great introduction to the genre or one of the quintessential giant monster films. Great fun throughout.",

On it contains many shorts along with this, his feature from 1921, to the audiences of today, to which I say Thank You Very Much! Because this film is just WAITING to be discovered! Max plays a ridiculously rich guy, who is about to get married, and how a single day&apos;s sequence of events could seriously jeopardize his engagement. I was surprised to learn that this is the first movie that uses the &quot;mirror&quot; gag that we&apos;ve seen countless times (most notably by the Marx Bros). Linder does this gag so astonishingly well, all other attempts in any other comedy (including animated!) pales in comparison. There are many other witty gags on display here, some fun with animals, some VERY clever disguise work (with some rather funny, but never offensive black person disguise) and some very amazing stunt work. And here&apos;s another reason why you should see this. With most silent movies nowadays, I don&apos;t find much particularly funny anymore. But with this, I was laughing out loud at least 3 times during the movie. And when I notice myself laughing, then it must mean something!",

      "reviewBody": "This is a masterful and faithful portrayal of Steinbeck&apos;s classic novel. The screenplay brings to life the tragic yet uplifting story of loyalty and the kind of bond that can grow between men that we are often reluctant to acknowledge, much less show.\n\nAside from the story, the cast is what really makes this film.  I have always held a soft spot for Gary Sinise after his role in Forrest Gump, wherein his character portrayed another facet of the bonding between men made brothers by cruel circumstance, yet can grow and flourish as the years and other circumstances come to pass.  Here, as Lenny&apos;s friend and protector against a world that baffles and confuses him, he shows the kind of rough-edged tenderness and affection that both endears us to his plight, and fills us with the dread of what we know must come between the men.  John Malkovich shows his depth as an actor by bringing to life the dull-witted but pure-hearted Lenny, in a way that will tug at your heartstrings.  I found myself both laughing (in a sad way) at Lenny&apos;s ineptness in dealing with a world clearly more confusing than his limited wits can manage, and crying over his being targeted for taunting and abuse by cruel and crude men, and ultimately done in by his brute strength when it was lacking the direction and temper given by his friend George.\n\nA pleasant surprise was Ray Walston as the aged but gentle and good-hearted ranch hand Candy, who has no one in life to love but his old sheepdog, who, like him, he knows, must ultimately be &quot;put down&quot; because of age and the wear and tear that a life of hard labor has worn down.  The scene of his finally surrendering his faithful canine companion to be euthanized by a gunshot to the back of the head by another well-meaning field hand is very heartbreaking.  Having grown up with the &quot;Uncle Martin&quot; of &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; Walston, seeing his adept performance in a dramatic role gave me a new appreciation for his versatility as a character actor.\n\nThose who watch this film should allow plenty of time alone to view it straight through with no interruptions.  Swallow your pride and keep a box of tissues handy, and some time afterwards for quiet contemplation and &quot;recovery&quot;."

We loved it!!\n\nOur child (nearly 9) loved it so much too.\n\nThe characters were sweet, the cat adorable, the storyline had a good message, and there were a lot of funny parts too. I even shed a tear near the end.\n\nSo much better than some of the other mainstream (big name) rubbish seen out there lately in the line of kids films which contain a lot of violence and nonsense.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the chickens/hens.\n\nWonderful Christmas film!",

      "reviewBody": "Like all Claire Denis films, &apos;Beau Travail&apos; demands constant vigilance and flexibility, never exactly forswearing narrative - there IS a plot here - but concentrating less on its mechanics than on the bits in between, the everyday rituals normally excised from the screen, a precise meditation on the landscape in which it is set, a rhythmic treatment of the titled beau travail, all seemingly irrelevant to the narrative, but making it inevitable, a linear narrative in a world of endless, pointless circles.\n\nLike &apos;Once Upon A Time In America&apos;, &apos;Travail&apos; opens with a sequence of seemingly random, unconnected sequences eventually bound together in an overpowering organising consciousness.  A shot of a silhouetted mural of soldiers marching over craggy rocks, which look like waves, an appropriately Melvillean image, with Foreign Legion chants blared over them.  The highly stylised rendering of a nightclub, which seems tiny, austere, minimally decorated, with lighting reflecting the rhythm of the music, and the soldiers between the local African women, their movements notably stilted, ritualised.  The officer seated alone.  The vast African landscape, a coastal desert, with abandoned phallic tanks, site of a military exercise, a group of topless men in rigid poses against the immemorial sand and sea, classical heroes.  An unseen hand writing.  A train travelling through the landscape as we follow someone&apos;s view out the window.  The same point of view after the train has moved.\n\nThese images do have an independent function.  They begin a pattern of dualities that are continued and complicated throughout the film leading to the eventual climax, always inscrutably observed by a third strand, Forestier, former informer turned commandant - water/desert; soldiers/locals; men/women; landscape/human; indoors/outdoors; play/work etc.  But this is an army, and these disparate elements must be controlled, as they are, by Galoup, the sergeant.  As the film opens, he embodies civilisation - he writes while others cannot communicate; he is the subject who sees, interprets, explains, while everyone else is an object in his narrative; he wears clothes while his soldiers go round naked; he is an all-seeing God who can decide men&apos;s fate, while these men are unthinking robots, sleepwalking through time-honoured rites.\n\nThe irony is that, because of all this, Galoup, the defender of discipline and convention, is the film&apos;s real outsider, not the mysterious Russian he seeks to expel, a man who learns another language to fit in, who quickly becomes one of the boys, who will defend his friends at the risk of his own death.\n\nIs this why Galoup abhors him, his humanity in this mechanistic unit of marital discipline?  Unlikely; Galoup is the only &apos;human&apos; character in the film, it&apos;s difficult to tell individual soldiers, even Sentain.  After all, that &apos;s what the Foreign Legion, in popular terms anyway, is all about: a refuge for the hunted, somewhere to hide your identity and past, become part of an anonymous mass.\n\nFor me, though, there is something missing.  For all the cool gazing on the masculine body, the absorbed interest in these very physical rituals, in the feminising of their military discipline (eg ironing; repeating the same tasks day in, day out, like housewives); there is a lack of the homoerotic charge lurching through Melville and Britten.  The gaze of the camera is, of course, Galoup&apos;s, the narrative a visualising of what he writes; and when he lies on the bed with his gun near the end, we can&apos;t tell whether the gesture will be onanistic or suicidal.  The rushed, hallucinatory climax, full of Leonesque stand-offs and ellipses, are framed by a shot of Galoup asleep, and a blazing white light when he awakes, as if he, like Noodles, has dreamed the whole thing, has sublimated his homosexuality into a murderous (but consummated) narrative, reduced vast geographical terrain (including three volcanoes whose explosive potential mirrors his own suppressed desire) to a narrow site for a private rite, a self-reflecting dance in an empty nightclub.\n\nAnd how cool is it that the real president of Djibouti is called Ismael!",

Wimmer comes across as being just as honest, caring and sincere as he needs to, which is considerable, since his character and performance depend on it. Berg, playing a somewhat-dimwitted man with a heart of gold is perfect, as he&apos;s often been in his minor, but memorable performances. The rest of the cast is more than competent, but the success of this movie depends on its two leads, and they come through with flying colors. You can&apos;t help but pull for these guys. One of the first thing a film-maker wants to do is get the audience interested and caring about the main characters, and trust me, you will be...\n\nFunny and sweet, this is the perfect movie for a quiet night alone with your honey. If you consider yourself at all a romantic (love conquers all...and the like), you&apos;ll love this movie.",

Beside her looks and sex appeal, her personality always shines through and she seems very comfortable on screen, even at a young age.\n\nA 7 out of 10. Best performance = B. Bardot. You never quite knew where this film was going to end up, but it reaches a touching ending of closure for all concerned.",

In fact this is a very German movie which is slightly based on Father Brown stories\n\nIf you see this film without regard of the period/place it was made, you might find the storyline and acting terrible backdated. However: this movie fits perfectly in the German 60&apos;s era of somewhat fuzzy detective &quot;thrillers&quot; after stories of Edgar Alan Poe and other English writers. For that era I find &quot;Das schwarze Schaf&quot; and also the second father brown movie &quot;Er kann&apos;s nicht lassen&quot; better than average.\n\nThe feeling of those movies (and especially the both Father Brown films) rely very much on the big-band jazz sound of Martin Boettcher, who was regularly asked to compose soundtracks during that period (later, Boettcher would compose the famous Winnetou soundtracks).\n\nAs conclusion: Do not watch this movie if you want to see the Father Brown of the stories. Do not watch it if you hate backdated films. For all others it is an old but nice movie, typically for it&apos;s era.",

Rarely has a battle of the sexes been so predictable. The story was filled with stereotypes and stereotypical behavior. The men came off as overgrown children. In any real world, their female counterparts wouldn&apos;t have put up with them for two weeks, much less years. It was painful to watch a game cast try to breath some humanity and originality into these characters. Moments intended as funny or telling merely smelled bad. Woody Allen covered the same ground years ago in a much better way. Try Hannah And Her Sisters. This particular would-be Woody update added nothing to the genre.",

His father was a British foreign-service diplomat; his mother, a nurse, was a crofters&apos;s daughter from the Scottish Highlands. The family spent much time moving from place to place, and Strummer spent his childhood in a variety of countries. At the age of 9, Strummer and his older brother David, 10, began boarding at the City of London Freemen&apos;s School in Surrey. Strummer rarely saw his parents during this time. He developed a love of rock music, listening to records by The Beatles and The Beach Boys, as well as American folk-singer Woody Guthrie (Strummer would even go by the name &quot;Woody&quot; for a few years, until changing his name to &quot;Joe Strummer&quot; a year and a half before the Clash was formed). Strummer was never very close to his brother David, but nonetheless David&apos;s suicide significantly changed Joe&apos;s outlook on life. After finishing his time in boarding school in 1970 Strummer moved on to London&apos;s Central School of Art &amp; Design, where he briefly flirted with the idea of becoming a professional cartoonist. During this time, Strummer shared a flat in the north London suburb of Palmers Green with friends Clive Timperley and Tymon Dogg.\n\nFor those who didn&apos;t know who is Joe Strummer and for those who haven&apos;t seen the movie yet..."

He meditates while doing handstands (guess this helps make him a better warrior, and you will be proved correct), then shows excellent swordsmanship by annihilating some &quot;half-people&quot; who appear to live in the sand. As &quot;Tremors&quot; (1990) later confirmed, sand creatures are nasty; besides, they threaten the life of our handsome hero. Looking like a romance novel cover model, Mr. Swayze must find sneering vigilante Christopher Neame (as Sho), the man killed his martial arts mentor...\n\nCooling his heels, Swayze stays at a farm with beautiful blonde widow Lisa Niemi-Swayze (as Kasha) and her cute son Brett Hool (as Jux), who just may be related to director Lance Hool. They live with brave Brion James (as Tark). Proving hairstylists will survive a nuclear holocaust, the Swayzes must protect her irrigation development from wicked Anthony Zerbe (as Damnil). His wells are running dry and she has all the water. This is highly derivative, but with good enough action. Swayze body watchers will be in more than pleased with his appearance. The soundtrack by Mad Max&quot; (1979) composer Brian May is adept.\n\n****** Steel Dawn (11/6/87) Lance Hool ~ Patrick Swayze, Lisa Niemi, Christopher Neame, Brion James",

      "reviewBody": "The Last Hangman Review\n\nMike Reynolds\n\nIt&apos;s a dirty job, but someone&apos;s got to do it. The clock strikes nine and the hangman goes to work, getting rid of criminals the old fashioned way. At the end of the day he puts on his cap and heads home to his wife like any other man. But what goes on in the head of an ordinary person who&apos;s job it is to kill? This is the question asked by Adrian Shergold, the director of The Last Hangman.\n\nThe film follows the true story of the rise of Britain&apos;s most prolific executioner, Albert Pierrepoint, and his struggle to be a lead a normal life. Pierrepoint is played by Timothy Spall, most noted for his great supporting roles in Vanilla Sky and The Last Samurai. Spall shines in this film, becoming both a calculating, intense killer and a jolly pub mate. As the film progresses, he literally transforms as his burden becomes greater. Juliet Stevenson plays Annie, Albert&apos;s arguably supportive wife. She portrays the guilt and paranoia of an English housewife painfully well. Through her, we see the full story of the couple&apos;s social and moral difficulties.\n\nPierrepoint&apos;s only real drive is that of any honest, hard working man. He just wants to be good at what he does. This keeps the audience in a emotionally conflicting state. The viewer desperately wants Albert to resign from his chilling career, while cheering on his incredible success.\n\nThe film is very nice to look at. What a feat. One can only imagine the difficulty of shooting a period piece independently. It was very interesting seeing the gritty grey streets of a wartime London recorded on 16. It seemed to give it a charming modern context, though there were jarring out of focus shots here and there. One memorable scene is brilliantly spliced with actual footage of a capital punishment protest.\n\nAside from the physical shooting of the film, there were strong symbolic devices at use. In order to hang someone efficiently, Pierrepoint would calculate the prisoner&apos;s height and weight. To do this he would look through a small peephole in the heavy cell door. Whenever anyone is shown through a crack, or a hole, it&apos;s a hint of grizzly foreshadowing. The method of passing time was artfully portrayed as well. Pierrepoint kept a logbook of all the people who he killed, their names written in perfect script. The stack of logbooks got bigger and bigger as years went by.\n\nFilms like The Last Hangman are important because they challenge our choices. This story makes us think of what we&apos;re responsible for in our lives and careers. Is the success worth the death of your inner self? That decision is up to us. Because the saddest thing about Albert Pierrepoint is that he applied for the job.",

I saw it when I was teenager (I&apos;m 24 now) and it has been a classic between my homies and I. Buddah help you if you don&apos;t like this film when I show it to you (GET OUT)!;-) I worry about people who dislike it so much. It means they are too serious. I suppose you need to be in the mind frame of a kid to really enjoy it, without jaded sexual expectations (and weirdoes, don&apos;t rent/buy this movie if you&apos;re just horny). Not the typical eighties sex fest. Rent it or buy it just to see the stupid mistakes (they are unreal) and the endless jokes you can get from it.  Classic! It&apos;s genius. So bad it&apos;s good. For instance, when they have the super cheesy 13th annual penguin run, then they say the key club has held the title since the 40&apos;s or something, IT JUST DOESN&apos;T ADD UP! and its GREAT! Or when they lock doors and three seconds later they just pop open. HILARIOUS, because it&apos;s not intentional!!! C&apos;mon now! If you cant find humor here, you are DEAD or just too damn serious. Don&apos;t expect an award winning script, it&apos;s about prune juice and telekinesis!!!!!"

All characters, especially the one portrayed by Shea, are portrayed exceptionally well. The plot keeps you glued to your seat, and you can&apos;t wait to see what happens next or how they will think of a way out of their predicament.\n\nThe only problems lie in the filming of the &quot;monster&quot; and to a lesser degree, the sound. I&apos;m not a personal fan of the &quot;flicker&quot; style of filming so it may work for others. I prefer a fluid style of filming throughout the entire film. It&apos;s hard to keep track of the events occurring when things &quot;flash&quot; around rapidly.\n\nBut if you can overlook it&apos;s extremely minor flaws, you&apos;re in for a treat with this one. The acting and the central theme of the plot are strong enough to overcome its shortcomings.\n\nMy final ratings: Quality: 7 Entertainment level: 7 Overall: 7 Consensus: This might be Toby Wilkins&apos; break as a writer/director and is a standout performance for Shea Whigham",

Through frequent off-hand visits to the local mortuary, she networks into a sub-rosa society of like-minded individuals who are more than eager to bring her &quot;into the fold&quot;. Unfortunately, her husband(CAROL BURNETT SHOW alum Lyle Waggoner) is unaware of her warped desires, and can&apos;t understand why he&apos;s not &quot;getting any&quot;.\n\nThe key issue making LOVE ME DEADLY such a memorably divergent trinket is the prudent sensitivity with which it approaches its grotesque premise. It plays like a schmaltzy, melodramatic LIFETIME CHANNEL movie with necrophilia in place of the customary, commiserative &quot;disease-of-the-week&quot; topic...never has a film been so characteristically at-odds with itself. Amazingly, this ill-advised wonder-work actually delivers in an all-wrong and rather dishonorable sort of way...it&apos;s not a great movie, critically speaking, or even an especially GOOD movie...but considering the unsavory subject-matter at hand, it&apos;s a surprisingly groomed and buttoned-down production which takes itself quite seriously(and for sheer novelty, what more could you possibly hope for?).\n\n5.5/10"

It really works.\n\nHow the director managed to edit down 4,500 hours of footage is beyond me but the final cut is excellent none the less.\n\nIf there ever was a film just about people , this is it.

Jacqueline Bisset&apos;s famous breasts are on ample display, but cannot maintain interest for 123 minutes of &quot;The Deep&quot;. I would hate to see the extended 176 minute version, because scenes, especially underwater, are stretched way too long as is. Reason number two is the fight on the beach cliff elevator. This is certainly a unique contraption, and makes for an exciting and well photographed confrontation. Reason number three is Robert Tessier&apos;s battle with one of Lou Gossett&apos;s thugs. This is about as intense as it gets. Reason number four is if you ever wanted to see the top blown off a lighthouse, this is your movie. The slow motion explosion is amazingly shot. That&apos;s about it for &quot;The Deep&quot;. The motives for all the treasure hunting mayhem are murky and the rushed underwater ending is disappointing. - MERK",

But my friend wanted to see it, so I agreed to tag along on opening night. \n\nI have to say, as a movie, it is genuinely enjoyable. The visuals are starkly entrancing without being distracting. The casting is pitch-perfect - Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield, in particular, do a great job. The ending is particularly well done (don&apos;t worry - it wasn&apos;t really spoiled by the trailer). \n\nThe problem is, it&apos;s really just a caricature of the book. The drama in Battle School moves too quickly, the characters of Peter and Valentine are almost completely absent, and even Ender&apos;s video game is sadly underdone. I&apos;m not usually a fan of splitting books into multiple movies, but this is one where two films would have done it justice. Also, the kids are just too old - there&apos;s an ironic moment in the movie where two officers talk about how conscripting kids under 15 &quot;used to be illegal&quot;, yet all the actors playing the kids look 15 or older!\n\nStill, it&apos;s a fun ride, and if you hadn&apos;t read the book these flaws really wouldn&apos;t be apparent. Definitely see it in the theater if you can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen.",

I&apos;ve seen four films by Hong now. I liked the first one I saw, Woman Is the Future of Man, a lot, but the other two, besides the one about which I&apos;m currently writing, I only barely recall. Woman on the Beach seems far too similar to Woman Is the Future of Man for me to like it a lot. I didn&apos;t hate it, by any means, though I did eventually grow tired of it. I liked the initial conflict, where a man brings along a woman whom he thinks of as his girlfriend on a trip with a film director friend of his. The director is kind of a jerk, and the girl is immediately attracted to him  either that, or she is so bothered by the meek guy that she just wants to spurn him. Later on, she discovers that the director&apos;s jerkiness is a pretty clear character trait. Well, duh. Much as I remember from Woman Is the Future of Man, Hong&apos;s major insight seems to be that men (particularly film directors) are jerks, and that women like jerks, but also think they can change them. It&apos;s a pretty trite observation, really, and, in the end, kind of hateful toward both sexes. It doesn&apos;t help that the woman becomes a completely jealous shrew. If I&apos;m remembering correctly, I liked the woman of Woman Is the Future of Man much better. She seemed, in the end, better and stronger than the men in her life.",

      "reviewBody": "Conceptually, the film actually doesn&apos;t hit its point until the final twenty minutes in which Baker finally confronts Ryder and accepts his fate. The final coffee shop scene and discussion conjures memories of Daniel Waters&apos; impeccable dialogue and pace ever-present in 1989&apos;s &quot;Heathers&quot;. Yes, this isn&apos;t &quot;Heathers&quot; and thankfully, it isn&apos;t &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; either, however, &quot;Sex &amp; Death 101&quot;, unlike both of the aforementioned films, doesn&apos;t stay with you, for better or worse. Again, the final scenes are well worth the wait and highlight exactly why Winona Ryder is everybody&apos;s favourite outsider. Her ability to present warped innocence and make it seem endearing is wonderful to watch. The moment that we see Death Nell writing in her journal (a throwback to Veronica Sawyer in Heathers) really emphasises this...Ryder&apos;s representation of the madness of youth and sex and sadness, all connected in one bizarre character. So, as a film, &quot;Sex &amp; Death 101&quot; isn&apos;t great, but as an example of good screen writing and character development (in the case of Death Nell), it is interesting to experience.",

      "reviewBody": "I went into watching this movie expecting another indie drama with a big ensemble cast and just enough quirk to be cool with the hipsters. Turns out, this is probably one of the best movies I&apos;ve seen in years. The plot revolves around Franklin Franklin, a bizarre man living alone in well, a small apartment, and his interactions and excursion with his various neighbors. I completely understand the negative reviews from critics, because the movie isn&apos;t perfect, There is some bizarre writing and story choices that might not bode well with audiences, but I honestly think that this movie is, in a way, a masterpiece. The characters all start off weird and somewhat repulsive, but as the movie progresses you begin understanding them and you begin to feel for them. There is rarely a movie that made me feel as much for the characters as I did in this movie. The reason for that is that the acting was fantastic, everyone played their character greatly, and there were little to no weaker parts to the performances. To wrap up, I highly recommend it if you can deal with some weird and bizarre, It&apos;s all worth it in the end.",

Why, pop a pill and turn into women, of course!\n\nNot all the performers are men in drag--the cast is filled out with quite a few busty-babes who are more than capable of giving their genderbending co-stars a run for their tassels--but if you enjoy drag queens, VEGAS IN SPACE is the movie for you. And for the most part, the male-to-female performers are expert in their work--which ranges ultra-high camp to occasional bouts of good old fashioned tacky. The script is silly, the cinematography, sets, special effects, and virtually everything else about the film is cheap. But the performers make it fun, with Doris Fish heading the line up.

The director must have realised that this was a bad move half way through making the movie so he added a few more of these unmemorable villains to make up for the fact he didn&apos;t have a big impressive killer robot in it and failed miserably.\n\nSorry but that sums it all up for me. There is of course a load of other faults that i won&apos;t go in to but that was the main fault when i watched it.\n\nA few little cool bits in this movie but the bad far outweighs the good.

      "reviewBody": "I decided to rent this only because I figured it would be a mildly-exciting venture into direct-to-video land, which I have ventured to many times and found some real gems.\n\nThis wasn&apos;t one of them.\n\nTheresa Russell plays Emily Russo, an art expert who is restoring some paintings at a church in LA. On her way home one night with her son Sam, carjackers posing as cops attack them, injuring Emily and killing Sam. Distraught, Emily soon finds that she is being suspected of the act, and who she claims attacked them perhaps never did so at all. From there, she goes on the run and undercover to find the men who attacked her, and to find out the all-important answer to why they did it.\n\nPlease, don&apos;t think that sounds like a good movie.\n\nThere is nothing to commend about this movie. All the characters besides Emily are come and go sort of people who you lose track of too easily. Not to say Emily is a great character. Theresa Russell is, well, annoying. (Is it just me, or does her voice sound like she&apos;s got a stuffy nose?) There are definitely unintentional laughs in her undercover scenes, with those wigs and clothes. I think when she was pretending to be Mexican may have been the worst scenes in the movie. She has this long dark red wig on, too much makeup, and this tight green slip dress, and once in a while, she breaks into street lingo and an attempted accent. It&apos;s painful. The kid who plays her son was mentally retarded, I think, with this permanent stupid look on his face, mostly seen when Emily imagines her son standing across the street, in the next room, in a doorway, etc. The best part of this &quot;plot&quot; is the reason for all of this. Don&apos;t read the next paragraph if you don&apos;t want to know. (Ooh, I&apos;d hate to ruin the shocking plot twists of this blockbuster hit!)\n\nSome corporation is trying to get rid of the Mexicans in LA, and a sample Emily took from one painting has something to do with that whole plot, I think there was a chemical in it that was involved. I can&apos;t remember, but it was something stupid that connected her carjacking to this painfully bad hidden &quot;shock.&quot;\n\nOkay, it&apos;s safe to read on, but all I really have left to say is that this movie is terrible, from beginning to end, and you won&apos;t be missing much if you just keep walking when you see it at the video store. I only wish I did that, but since I didn&apos;t, learn from my mistake and move on. You could do so much better...."

It&apos;s a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It&apos;s a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It&apos;s the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&apos;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&apos;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",

      "reviewBody": "The Specialist 1969 (Sergio Corbucci ) yey another revenge based Spaghetti Western, of particular interest in this one is its not directed by Sergio Leonne or features a soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone. What it does contain is French Singer Johnny Halliday, who was France&apos;s biggest rock pop (The French Elvis) star throughout 60s/70s and into the 80. He was known as much for his hell raising as his singing (there is a great documentary about him, made just after he died in 2017, if you able to find it) What about the film, well its a decent western, like most of the genre, there is a reason for all the carnage, in this case its, the return of the gunslinger Hud Dixon, to avenge the death of his brother by the town&apos;s folk of Blackstone . This Dead Man&apos;s Shoes but with cowboy boots and chaps. There&apos;s villain&apos;s El Diablo, the Mexican with one arm, crooked businessmen and politicians (aren&apos;t they all) and the love interest Sheba played by actress Sylvie Fennec who I&apos;ve never seen in anything before who is drop dead gorgeous.\n\nThere are also some random hippies and a pacifist sheriff who has flowers in the barrel of his pistol (it was film in 1969 after all) great stuff but not a great film. 6/10 . If you want to try a Corbucci film, try The Great Silence, at least it features a Morricone score, and is based in the snow, I&apos;m sure Tarantino got ideas for Hateful 8 from this.",

      "reviewBody": "Actress Clara Bow, so confident and frolicking in her silent films, looked upon talkies with trepidation. With no stage experience, Bow relied on her visual spunkiness to mesmerize the public. The Brooklyn born and raised actress felt her accent and a slight stammer had the potential of slamming her film career shut when she was placed before a recording device. One of Hollywood&apos;s top female silent movie stars faced an uncertain future when she appeared in a Paramount Pictures&apos; early talkie, April 1929 &quot;The Wild Party.&quot;\n\nDorothy Arzner was given the director&apos;s assignment to handle the skittish Bow. After her successful directorial debut in March 1927&apos;s &apos;Women of Fashion,&apos; Arzner directed three more silents before Paramount offered her the &quot;The Wild Party.&quot; When Bow heard herself on playback after she was given a brief screen test talking into a microphone, the actress said, &quot;How can I be in pictures with a voice like that?&quot; Assured she was fine, Bow was handed an 100-page script she had to memorize within two weeks before filming. On the set, the opening days were difficult for her. Today&apos;s viewers can readily witness her lack of confidence and uneasiness in the new medium. She immediately hated talkies. &quot;They&apos;re stiff and limiting,&quot; Bow remarked. &quot;You lose a lot of your cuteness, because there&apos;s no chance for action, and action is the most important thing to me.&quot;\n\nShe found herself on the sound stage more conscious about where the microphone was than delivering her lines. Arzner came up with the idea of suspending the microphone on the end of a fishing rod (one of many reports crediting a number of people, including Lionel Barrymore, of innovating the first boom mic) and having it follow her. The results were better, but the actress occasionally looked up to spot the mic. &quot;We had quite a time in the beginning,&quot; Arzner remembered, &quot;because to be aware of the pantomime which she was accustomed to, then have words to remember, was very difficult for her.&quot;\n\nPlaying opposite Bow was actor Frederic March, in only his second credited feature film. A banker turned actor, he first appeared on the Broadway stage, then turned to Hollywood in the late 1920s. In the film, he&apos;s a professor at an all-women&apos;s college who falls for Bow, even though her behavior is opposite of his. She&apos;s equally attracted to him, but several adventures occur placing roadblocks in their relationship. March ended up as one of cinema&apos;s most respected actors, nominated by the Academy five times for Best Actor, earning two wins.\n\nParamount premiered &quot;The Wild Party&quot; with a special public appearance by Bow at the 4,200 seat Brooklyn Paramount Theatre. Ever a comic, she said in a short speech before the movie played, speaking in her heavy New York City accent, &quot;I hope youse all prouda me.&quot; Variety didn&apos;t see anything particularly wrong with her voice, stating &quot;it was good enough to survive the transition to sound.&quot; But another critic lambasted her, describing her voice possessing a &quot;harsh tonal quality that is not very easy on sensitive eardrums.&quot; Her talking debut, however, was a financial success as the public continued to envelop her engaging personality.",

      "reviewBody": "Hélène is &quot;a simple housemaid&quot;, living a very modest life with her husband and daughter, who both take her for granted. One day, after watching a couple play chess in idyllic conditions, she decides to learn how to play. \n\nThroughout the film, chess is very much a symbol for Hélène aspiring to more in life. At one point, while trying to teach her husband how to play, her eyes light up as she says &quot;La dame est la pièce la plus forte... c&apos;est fou hein?&quot; which could be roughly translated as &quot;The queen is the strongest piece on the board... crazy, huh?&quot;.\n\nThis single sentence seems to encapsulate the whole state of mind of our protagonist. On one hand, the idea that she could accomplish anything, even be great or the best at anything seems far-fetched to her, yet terribly enticing. She is on a journey towards self-realization that is both exciting and a little scary to Hélène and those around her. \n\nSandrine Bonnaire is absolutely amazing as usual, and succeeds in showing the state of mind of her character in very few words. Kevin Kline is great as well playing Dr. Kröger, the man who teaches chess to Hélène and develops an unusual and complex bound with her. There are lots of nuances in their relationship and again, in few words, we as viewers can sense a lot is going on. Tension, attraction, challenges.\n\nCaroline Bottaro&apos;s direction captures very well Hélène&apos;s modest and quiet life and the implicit contrasts between social classes. \n\nI recommend this movie. If you are not convinced yet, give Guy Bellinger&apos;s review (here on IMDb) a read.",

The end song &quot;The Main Event/Fight&quot; sung by Miss Streisand is a showstopper."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is probably the best holocaust-movie ever made. Not operating with violent scenes or showing hordes of German soldiers or SS-criminals, gas chambers or concentration camps, but every single minute of the movie is full with fear, love, and struggle for a future. The shepherd&apos;s stubborn fight against his own destiny and the destiny of his people filled with so much plain human depth what is almost unbearable. I saw men crying like babies watching this movie (I must admit - I was one of them) because its beauty and tragedy are simply not conceivable. You feel hopelessly lost and helpless, but somehow being a better human being by the catharsis. The movie is also a trustworthy, authentic and accurate testimony of the destiny of hundreds of thousands of Jews from the rural countryside in Hungary. A must see.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s difficult to know how to take a film that begins with a history lesson (to the self-important sound of a beating drum, no less) and ends with a quote from Plato. Between the two is a narrative that wants to be both a conventional love story and an unconventional period film. It doesn&apos;t quite succeed at either, but for viewers of LADY JANE, the pleasure is in the details, and there are plenty of those.\n\nTo first dispense with the glaring historical inaccuracy that lies at the film&apos;s center, Lady Jane Grey, the Nine-Day Queen of England in 1553, did not in truth have a passionate love match in her husband, Guilford Dudley. Theirs was an arranged marriage, highly political in nature and masterminded by Dudley&apos;s ambitious father, the Duke of Northumberland. In reality, Jane resented and distrusted her husband, who was a spoiled and rather empty-headed young man with none of the high intellectual achievement so prominent in Jane.\n\nFor the second dispensation, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Jane, is still unskilled at acting in this, her first role. She can furrow her brow with admirable dexterity to denote every emotion from confusion to embarrassment to sexual fulfillment, but there&apos;s little evidence of much going on behind, in the furrows of an actor&apos;s brain. However, since those afore-mentioned details surround her, it becomes fairly easy for a more demanding audience to overlook her callowness.\n\nNow for the details, beginning with everyone else in the cast. Has John Wood ever utilised his supercilious half-smile to better advantage? As Northumberland, he&apos;s perfect - driven by the need to consolidate his power when Jane&apos;s cousin Edward VI falls into a fatal illness, he conceives a scheme that will require relentless control over nearly everyone at court. While his fellow ministers, all burly toughs, inevitably knuckle under to his combination of silken flattery and outright threats, he&apos;s thwarted by two seemingly weak women - Jane and Mary Tudor (played with real grit and bitterness by Jane Lapotaire). It&apos;s a tossup whether Wood is better at the threats or at two points of emotional breakdown - one, when he must cast the die and order the agonising prolongation of Edward&apos;s death to complete his plans, or when, mud-pelted and dishevelled following his defeat by Mary&apos;s army, he ends up in the Tower, where all he can offer to his sons and followers is a weary, `I&apos;m sorry.&apos; It&apos;s the rare film where Wood&apos;s comic instincts don&apos;t get the better of his serious performance - this is one of them.\n\nAs Jane&apos;s equally controlling parents, Patrick Stewart and Sara Kestelman are almost as good. Stewart&apos;s character, the Duke of Suffolk, isn&apos;t a bright man, but his pursuit of his ambitions never quite overrides his notion of family honor, and this keeps him sympathetic, as all the supposed villains of the film remain. That&apos;s another of the details that deserves cherishing - the refusal to go for simplistic characters. Stewart is especially good when he throws all caution to the wind and raises an army to rescue his daughter, overriding even the objections of his formidable wife.\n\nOther details are in the costuming, the suitably squalid tavern and brothel scenes, the bit where the aristocratic Kestelman chows down on her dinner, gnawing on a greasy chop and wiping her mouth with her sleeve, and the achingly beautiful winter deer hunt that runs under the opening credits. All this and more make up for a downbeat ending and a central failure to come up with a satisfying examination of that most enigmatic of queens, Lady Jane Grey."

      "reviewBody": "Derek Zoolander is stupid. So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry&apos;s plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn&apos;t know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.\n\nDerek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry&apos;s number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander&apos;s stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live&apos;s Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents&apos; Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller&apos;s father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek&apos;s agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!&apos;s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go&apos; playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson&apos;s `Beat It&apos; as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren&apos;s own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person&apos;s expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn&apos;t go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a very enjoyable if not completely accurate rendition of Harry Houdini&apos;s life. Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, young and in love in real life, do a great job of playing Harry and Bess Houdini. An amateur magician himself, Curtis gives a great performance in the first really good role of his career. There will be many to come. What&apos;s accurate about this film? Most of the escapes shown in the film such as when Houdini allowed himself to be hung upside down outside of a tall building while confined in a strait jacket, his offering and succeeding to escape from any pair of handcuffs that his audiences could produce, and his decision to go through with being locked in a box submerged in water while he himself is bound in chains.\n\nWhat&apos;s inaccurate in the film? It&apos;s more a matter of what is omitted. The film does mention Houdini&apos;s running battle with spiritualists. What it doesn&apos;t mention is Houdini&apos;s tiff with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over the whole issue. The depth and length of this disagreement is considerable, though, and it&apos;s understandable that in a film not of documentary length that it had to be left out.\n\nIt makes a good double bill with the1976 made-for-TV film &quot;The Great Houdini&quot; with Paul Michael Glaser in the title role. That 70&apos;s version of Houdini&apos;s life gives more details about what made the man tick, even if there is something about its atmosphere that transports one back to the days of disco.",

This is a very big deal because the government shouldn&apos;t be allowed to do that but they can.We see many different stories about how a certain crisis happened in America and how different peoples freedom of speech were punished. The documentary give a different view of our right to freedom of speech and how if they can&apos;t punish you for your speech then they&apos;ll find a different problem to accuse you with. When we think freedom of speech we think that we can say whatever we want but in reality the government can take away our ability to do so. This is a great documentary on how if the government feels like you are going to cause a panic in the society then they can take your freedom of speech and make it harder for you to say what you want without getting punished for it. If you are interested in learning about freedom of speech and the different ways that it has been used against people I recommend that you watch this documentary."

Besides being more or less ignored by her family, used that Tomlin simply have to take care of them, she has other serious threats that don&apos;t involve cats and spiders but something far more dangerous - humans. Along with quite inane plot, everything is exaggerated: this is not a kind, loving family but a bunch of spoiled brats throwing tantrums, husband and his colleagues are more concerned with profit, Mexican maid is non stop dancing and even neighbors are more concerned about giving interviews than actually giving Tomlin support. Any normal person would pack her bags long ago and run away, but Tomlin - being good wife and self-sacrificing mother - totters on, even as her steps became smaller and smaller. It sounded as a good idea on the paper but is not really funny, perhaps because main character is simply not likable enough - Tomlin is great comedian when given chance to be wicked but as a perpetually serving housewife she is simply annoying (only once, she appears as rude telephone operator &quot;Ernestine&quot; and that minute lightens up the screen). Perhaps great fun for teenagers who delight in obvious jokes but not particularly involving as movie experience and sadly, very far from thrill of 1957. original.",

In addition, i think that our parents took us with my brother to see it in theater as a kid ! Thirty years later, the movie is still funny : the idea is really original and is a pit of funny moments : a second class actor thinks he plays the killer in a movie while he has been picked up by real gangsters ! The cool dumb actor is played by Pierre Richard who belongs to the pantheon of the french funny comedians along De Funès, Michael Youn His personal trait would be his huge enthusiasm, so big that he can&apos;t control it and become clumsy ! The first part in the movie takes place in Paris and i can see now how french society has changed since (for the worst) ! The final takes places in Saint Tropez (again as usual) but the action is rather indoor and that&apos;s why i have always thought it happens in a mountain lodge ! In addition, Pierre goes with a lot of famous faces among them the French &quot;LHO&quot; from a recent previous TV review !",

This is a testament of its time and while its views of the &quot;future&quot;, which are depicted in pictures that are supposed to show us what is going to come - although now I guess what has come would be more true(?) ... and those pictures show large buildings and a boxing match.\n\nThe first one seems to be a quite accurate prediction, I&apos;m not sure what to make of the second one. Gladiator games were there in the past, so I don&apos;t think there is much symbolism there to be found. Whatever the case and whatever you may read into this, the movie/documentary will not make it too easy for you to digest what you see. It can all scratch the surface of many things, even when trying to get different perspectives (two parts of the movies).\n\nWhen this was made it also stir up some controversies. It&apos;s not just the voice over but the moving pictures that at least suggest certain things. Flaws in societies and humans. Allegedly some countries were not happy to say the least. One of them was apparently the US of A. Now there is more to be found that is almost as interesting as the documentary itself ... in a special on the disc version I have from America. But this won&apos;t be an easy watch either, running over an hour in Italian with subtitles like the film itself. It&apos;s up to you, what you take from this",

      "reviewBody": "Not that I felt the same thrill Thierry must have gotten while roaming the streets with street artists, I however admit to downloading the movie via torrent (yes its illegal), and so watched it in my own living room for anyone interested in the circumstances of the review.\n\nViewers should be reminded that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a documentary rather than a movie, but at the same time plays out more like an adventure movie than an educational one about street artists. Albeit being more down to earth, a fitting comparison could be Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.\n\nThierry Guetta is our main character and camera guy at the same time. While lurking behind the camera he tells us his intriguing story when his life took a sudden and distinct turn. He had became known as &quot;the guy with the camera&quot; - developing some kind of compulsive disorder after his mother passed. His argument that everything should be recorded or else abruptly might get lost at any point in life seems reasonable but his thousands of tapes, that nobody would ever watch, piled up in his basement confirms the maladaptive nature of his behavior. \n\nHis compulsive filming became a useful tool first when he met a street artist that he began to follow - filming every event of the artists creative process. He sank deeper and deeper into the world of street artists and that became sort of an addiction to Thierry. He seemed to almost forget about his wife and kids. Exit Through the Gift Shop tells us as much about street artisting as it does about Thierry himself. Despite being, as he himself points out, &quot;a ghost behind the camera&quot;, his character truly steals the show. This is by no means a problem but rather enrich the story with a greater purpose. Thierrys meeting with Banksy and the following episodes poses a lot of interesting questions about what art really is, what it means to humans, what talent is made of and even about complex group behavior. \n\nDespite being directed by a street artist and evidently put together from thousands of different tapes, Exit Through the Gift Shop is amazingly well directed. It doesn&apos;t feel hyped, it doesn&apos;t seem to lie or exaggerate the happenings and the fact that an interesting, motivated and special character gets to portrait everything from an outside view is fascinating to watch. My text is hardly enough to summarize it so the only tip i can give you is WATCH IT!",

      "reviewBody": "40 Days and 40 Nights could have been written into something interesting. In fact I&apos;m sure it started out interesting, then a series of re-writes probably ruined it. The film cannot decide if it&apos;s a sex farce, a date movie, or some kind of statement about morality. The cast seems generally appealing, and the idea of such a promiscuous young man suddenly abstaining from sex sets up some interesting possibilities. Ultimitely, it just goes down as another failed date movie.\n\nJosh Hartnett plays a young man who has just broken up with the girl of his dreams. He then becomes wildly promiscuous; sleeping around with anyone who will talk to him. After some time, his conscience begins to get the better of him, and he swears off sex for Lent. Yep, that means he cannot even masturbate or so much as kiss a girl for the time frame mentioned in the title. That seems like an interesting starting point for a film, but scene after scene never generates the results we the audience are after.\n\nOf course, Hartnett meets another wonderful young lady at the laundry mat. They obviously fall for each other instantly, but their relationship is nothing more than a ploy to see how much the young man can be tempted to break his vow. Of course the script doesn&apos;t give him the courage to be honest about why he can&apos;t sleep with his new girlfriend. This is only meant to cause tension between the two of them, and frankly it does nothing more than delay what we know will eventually happen.\n\nScene after scene reminds you that this is only a movie, and in no way do people behave normally or do things happen rationally. First of all, would it make any sense for a guy looking to avoid sex to hang around with a babe like Shannyn Sossamon? I think not. How about their first date? The two of them just ride around San Francisco on a public bus and make warm faces at one another while &quot;Chemistry&quot; by Semisonic chimes away on the soundtrack. Can we say &quot;date movie&quot;? How about the office where Hartnett works? All the girls are hot of course, further tempting our young man. All the guys dress like GAP models, and none of them talk about sports at all! Sure we guys talk about sex at work, but we always at least talk a little about sports, too. In another scene, Hartnett actually gives Sossamon an orgasm using only the petals of a flower. (He can&apos;t touch her, if you recall!) To meet a woman like that.... if only! On a more serious note, practicing Catholics will definitely be offended by one scene in particular. In it, Hartnett walks in on his brother who is a priest in training and catches him making out with a nun. If this were an intelligent film, you might make the case that the film is only lobbying for priests to be able to have relations with women; perhaps to help alleviate some of the child abuse scandals. Trust me though, this film is not that intelligent. The scene was included only for schlock value.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting idea, but there were just too many ridiculous scenes to make it watchable. The film comes off as being more than a little wrong headed in a couple ways. First of all, nobody is really as sex-obsessed as the people in this film. And second of all, going without sex for 40 days and nights is disappointing, but not the end of the world. Having sex with a condom..... now there&apos;s torture!!!! 5 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",

The music score is excellent.  The ending was rather sad though.\n\nThis is a must if you like dinosaur films like me.\n\nRating: 4 and a half stars out of 5."

There are some slow moments in the middling half and some of the writing gets a tad mawkish. That said, the acting is fine, Tina Majorino is really good as the animal-loving daughter who befriends the seal, and it was really nice to see Keith Carradine in a somewhat atypical role as he portrayed the most likable human character. The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is magical and the music is lovely.\n\nWhat makes Andre though is the seal Andre, played in real-life by a sea-lion. Andre is one lovable character, he is so cute, endearing and funny. His scenes with Majorino were very touching, and he just steals the film from everybody else with effortless ease. Overall, a very sweet but enjoyable family fare, and I just want to add I noticed no rip-off of anything, then again I am not as observant as some people. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

A noble sentiment, but a man would have to be completely out of his gourd to attempt that...its not like the park has a series of fortified bunkers and a moat around it!!! The most insane plot twist (no one is in suspense about this piece anyway) is that the &quot;authorities&quot; hire two Asian assasins to take out the hero. What the $%^#$^! is that all about? It is just one of the many warped plot contrivances that earn this work a lofty six on the Tango and Cash scale of implausability. Forgive the spelling."

The only redeeming factor is some nice red rock photography, and some really wild and impressive stunt work. I really can&apos;t recommend sitting through all the nonsense that precedes the aerial acrobatics however. If the story had been more logical and better developed, this could have been a fairly decent film, but unfortunately that was not to be. Ah me! - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "An amazing film, one of my favorites. I watch this regularly, especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming, just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.\n\nEverything in this film works toward one end: to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film, designed to create confusion and startlement, this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack, the juxtaposition of images, they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn&apos;t right, that something out of the ordinary is taking place, and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist, to pull away from, to not allow it to affect one&apos;s &quot;ordinary life.&quot; \n\nBut as the movie progresses, the tone begins to shift, and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn&apos;t about being afraid of the unknown, but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the &quot;subliminal images&quot; in life, allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous, only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.\n\nDreyfuss&apos; character takes us on this journey, met with resistance all along the way. His wife, his neighbors, his job, his community, all are working against him, and it&apos;s only when he&apos;s reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand, but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place, and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.\n\nThe ending of this film, when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience, brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the &quot;adult&quot; sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary, one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. \n\nPowerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating. I highly recommend this film for anyone jaded with life and seeking a sense of renewal."

      "reviewBody": "As a film Dr. Strangelove was so well received that a more serious film on the same topic, Failsafe, failed to find an audience. Yet Strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is the ultimate object of any great work of cinema.\n\nGeneral Jack D. Ripper has sent out the Strategic Air Command bombers and locked down Burpelson Air Force Base so that higher ups can&apos;t interfere. He&apos;s struck back at the dirty Communists for pushing fluoridation of the water supply which he feels has interfered with his bodily functions.\n\nRipper might want to have checked with the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Buck Turgidson who when we meet him seems to have all his bodily functions working just fine. A second opinion on Ripper&apos;s lack of bodily functions might have revised his reason on why his particular functions weren&apos;t doing well.\n\nOf course his actions have created a crisis and President Muffley of the United States is busy trying to talk to Premier Kissoff of the USSR to prevent a nuclear war. That is in case those SAC bombers can&apos;t be recalled. One of the bombers commanded by Major Kong is anxious to do battle with the &apos;Rooskies&apos;.\n\nDirector Stanley Kubrick went poaching on the black comedy normally that would be the province of Billy Wilder. But even Wilder in his wildest dreams never used those wonderful Dickensian names for his characters that Kubrick is so delighting in. My favorite however is the part played by Keenan Wynn as the army colonel commanding the tactical force that liberates Burpelson, Colonel Bat Guano.\n\nJack D. Ripper is played by Sterling Hayden a man consumed by his lack of bodily functions. This is a takeoff on Army General Edwin Walker who commanded US troops in Germany and was relieved when it was discovered he was indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society propaganda which included their fears about fluoridation of water. Curiously enough that cause was actually taken up by other than fanatic right-wingers, people like Ralph Nader. Could Ripper have been right after all?\n\nGeorge C. Scott is cigar chomping, bodily functioning spoof of legendary SAC commander Curtis LeMay. He&apos;s having quite the difficult time in deciding just who to root for in this crisis.\n\nPeter Sellers got an Oscar nomination for playing three different characters in Dr. Strangelove. Sellers is President Muttley, Colonel Mandrake of the RAF an exchange officer serving under Sterling Hayden and the crazed former Nazi nuclear scientist Dr. Strangelove. Watching the film, it&apos;s almost hard to believe this is the same man using three different voices and appearances that makeup alone could not explain. Sellers lost to his fellow British player Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady.\n\nIn fact Dr. Strangelove also lost as Best Picture to My Fair Lady. Of course George Bernard Shaw never put his legendary wit to the issue of mutual nuclear annihilation. Neither did Billy Wilder, but I have a feeling those two talents together couldn&apos;t have done any better than Stanley Kubrick.\n\nThe image that stays in your mind from the film I guarantee will be Slim Pickens as Major Kong riding that hydrogen bomb down to its &apos;Rooskie&apos; target like a bucking bronco.\n\nHopefully we won&apos;t meet Major Kong again, who knows where and who knows when.",

Other pleasures included seeing familiar actors playing against type: Eduardo Ciannelli as the sweet and loyal former valet of the Archduke, Henry Travers as Frank Morgan&apos;s dotty but perspicacious father, May Robson as a crude, cigar-chomping hotelier with a heart of gold and red drawers. The premise that the love of one&apos;s life can return and the affair will resume even decades later is examined wittily and touchingly in this cinematic version of Robert E. Sherwood&apos;s play. The former lovers, Barrymore and Diana Wynyard, are funny, sexy and heartbreaking. Frank Morgan, as the husband, is fine in a thankless role. And the music which contributes to the emotionality of the work is terrific. This little-known film deserves to be released on DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "From the outset, &apos;Hide and Seek&apos; promises more than it can deliver, and left me not only disappointed, but also a little disturbed.\n\nIt storms straight into the story with Anne (Hannah) kidnapped by an intruder. With a series of flashbacks we are told that she was expecting a child, only to be informed at the hospital that she has made a mistake and is, in fact, not pregnant. It transpires that the guy doing the tests is the kidnapper, and he and his wife plan to hold Anne captive throughout her pregnancy, ultimately killing her and keeping the baby as their own.\n\nThere is a glimmer of an original idea behind this, but it is so badly executed that after about 45 minutes it really begins to drag. Obviously, the comparisons to &apos;Misery&apos; are expected, but if you thought Kathy Bates&apos; performance was over the top, wait until you see Jennifer Tilly! - not so much a woman on the edge, more like 200 miles over it! She sounds like a demented &apos;Mickey Mouse&apos; (check out the bedroom scene, she even has the ears!) and grows ever more unbelievable, swinging from charming host to psycho killer in a flash. But this show degenerates into farce, particularly in the scene with the &apos;diaper service&apos;. I was in hysterics! A totally unbelievable character, and therefore lacking in any malice, and providing no suspense whatsoever. The rest of the movie is full of such glaring plotholes that it comes across like a cheesy TV movie, with the whole idea leaving a nasty taste.\n\nWatch it for Tilly if nothing else. You won&apos;t forget it!!"

The song &apos;Sukha Dukha&apos; still gets my eyes wet. The movie is too emotional and relatable, but it got limited to the first half. Once the politics came in, the movie became a fictitious drama and I got disconnected with the character once and for all.\n\nI respect the effort the team has made in this movie. But repeating the same thing starts getting boring no matter how good it is. Still, I wish to see the life of other common man in different context. Keep producing more of them with better story-lines.\n\nMy rating - 8/10 for amazing visuals and the performance.",

      "reviewBody": "I seldom watch horror movies - natural disasters such as volcanoes, tisuni, hurricanes or earthquakes, together with violent crimes, serial killers and terrorist suicide bombers, provide enough real horror to make any fictional additions redundant. This leaves me no time for films about aliens, imaginary new diseases, and monsters from the deep or the swamp. Once I would have included many films featuring man&apos;s inhumanity to man in this no-no category, and some friends felt I was squeamish in my movie selections. This changed when Cecil DeMille&apos;s &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; was again released after many years on the forbidden list. Although the scenes from the Roman Arena may be tame by the standards of modern horror films with their digital sequences of human bodies exploding into pieces, this film involved the viewer in the lives of the characters in a way that only a few Directors still can today and I reacted with abhorrence. Later I realized DeMille was reminding us how little human nature had changed over the past millennium. Historically speaking most people today live in a very stable society and only by remaining continually cognisant of the depths to which the human ego can drive our behaviour can we hope for this to continue. Roman civilization was a long lasting stable society in which citizens lived in relative security under the rule of law. Romans came to appreciate that in order to maintain this it was necessary for every citizen to be aware of the sheer horror of the alternative, and this need was met by gradual evolution of public entertainment in the Arena from poetry readings to barbaric exhibitions of violence. For us today horror films in movie theatres serve the same purpose as the gladiatorial contests of the Roman Arena.\n\nSo much for psychology, discussed here only to help differentiate between horror and sleaze in our entertainment. If you enjoy good sleaze it is irrelevant and unhelpful - this was written for the many reviewers who have condemned Naked Fear for being downright sleazy, which it is not. It is the story of a girl who is raped by a madman and then set loose naked in a forest knowing that she has a 15min head start after which he hunts her down for &quot;sport&quot;, and shoots her before she can tell the police. Films about people being hunted in this way go back a very long time but &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, filmed concurrently with the original King Kong over 70 years ago, is still far the best (see my review in this database). I well remember the sense of shock and horror I felt when I first saw it. It had very well controlled changes in pace, well rounded characters - not just cardboard cutouts - and many carefully planned details, even down to the knocker on the door of the villain&apos;s home. By comparison, the many remakes have all been relatively crude. Of them, Naked Fear, released in 2007, is probably the best. It is based on the story of Robert Hansen, an Alaskan who raped and hunted 15 girl strippers in this way before he was caught. There are always a few men who use the services of prostitutes, but still feel they are so disgusting that the girls should be killed. Making us aware of how far a hypocritical attitude towards violence to prostitutes has permeated into our society was one of the objectives of this film, and there is no reason for calling it a sleazy remake of TMDG just because the victim was a girl who was stripped before she was hunted. This not only provides a link to real events, greatly increasing its sense of reality, but also adds to the horror viewers feel when they see the totally unprotected victim being released into a forest replete with sharp twigs, thorny shrubs, and dangerous wildlife. I doubt if any viewer can watch it without sensing how impossible it would be to flee effectively under such a handicap. No doubt Danielle de Luca was provided with some sort of stick on soles for her feet during the filming, but she was still very brave to accept such a role and I greatly admire her for doing so.\n\nAlthough a few badly lit night sequences leave the viewer guessing, the quality of this film comes closer to that of TMDG than most (if not all) of the other remakes released over the years, with its powerful final sequence effectively showing the deranging impact such encounters have on any victims who survive. The introductory sequences are long enough to give depth to the characters, and the actual hunt sequences are not overextended lasting about 20min with Diana clothed again and, perhaps more important, something round her feet for the last five of them. But at 108min overall this film remains too long, and does not maintain the tension achieved by TMDG which had the tautness of a 63min film. Its ending was overlong, overdark and overdrawn - the main climax was the scene on the rocks, the remainder was probably designed to fend off sexploitation charges. Overall I rate it at a solid six.and recommend it to everyone who enjoys horror films - particularly anyone believing these films require mythical monsters and or supernatural events to create real horror.\n\nOne may hope films dragging such subject matter out from under the curtain of obscurity may make it much less likely that characters such as Robert Picton (believed to have fed the bodies of more than 20 girls he killed to the pigs on his farm) can operate for so long before their atrocities are revealed.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re looking for a horror movie that is just simple and a bit &quot;mindless&quot;, then Steel Trap may just be for you. \n\nI&apos;ll admit, I was only interested in this movie because I loved the PS3 game Heavy Rain, and when I discovered Laurence Pascal was in this movie, I had to check it out. \n\nIts starts off interesting with the use of children nursery rhymes to try to add a scary element to the movie, but then half way in, decides to forget about it. The title of the movie, and the cover, does throw you off. The scene in the cover never happened in the movie, and the movie didn&apos;t really had any traps. It tries to draw you in by making you believe it&apos;s going to be a unique horror film, but ends up being another slasher movie. I did not have an issue with the acting as much as I did with the script. It seemed like the writers were trying too hard to make the characters sound &quot;American&quot; with the overuse of profanity and the poor choice of dialog. Along with the poor development of the characters&apos; back story, it made the characters seem too unrealistic and unlikable to the point where you most wouldn&apos;t didn&apos;t favor anyone enough to hope they survive. This did hurt the movie towards the end of the film, when things were being resolved, as all the pieces of the puzzle didn&apos;t add up well enough for me. The movie even tries to hint itself at the ending and the killer, but as stated before, the lack of story development hurt the film&apos;s chance to give you that &quot;oh my gosh&quot; ending it was trying to go for. It wasn&apos;t a horrible ending, I just felt it could have worked itself to it better. As with Saw, the film tires to teach you a lesson at the end, but seems like the idea was thrown at the end to try to give it some explanation and closure.\n\nThe film lacked a lot of substance, but on the plus side, the film was very simple. As I said, it was very mindless. Not overcomplicated, nothing too confusing thrown at you, honestly, Steel Trap is good if you just want a B or C rated horror movie to throw in the DVD player on a night you don&apos;t have anything better to do. \n\nOverall, good for a one time watch.",

      "reviewBody": "What do you do when you&apos;ve saved Christmas (twice) and Halloween? Save Easter of course. This is a raucous family film with animal antics, bumbling crooks, and a touch of romance. \n\nThe Dog Who Saved Easter takes the Zeus (Mario Lopez)o n a whole new adventure and season. With both old and new characters you can jump right into the movie without having seen the previous chapters. Both the canine and human characters get a little romance while dodging the crooks who are about to turn Easter into a rotten egg. Dean Cain, Joey Diaz, and Patrick Muldoon are the most bumbling crooks since the Wet Bandits and in clever irony Diaz&apos;s Stewey eats more floor droppings than any of the canine cast. Catherine Hicks as Cressida (channeling her inner Cruella de Vil) heads the cast of villains as the mean, mastermind attempting to ruin the day, but she didn&apos;t count on Zeus, a big, huge mistake. But it&apos;s not just about the dogs, Beverley Mitchell as Alice not only struggles to keep her fledgling business afloat but also her love life. \n\nThe over-the-top physical comedy, sight gags, and of course the cuddly heroes make The Dog Who Saved Easter a welcome addition to your holiday and family film collection. Both our daughter (7) and son (10) were captivated and laughing throughout the story, especially at the poop jokes, and you can&apos;t have a dog comedy without poop jokes.",

      "reviewBody": "To cut to the chase, &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; was funny about half-way through, but then it became tiresome and predictable.\n\nDana Carvey plays Eddie Farrell, the world&apos;s most successful conman. Well, not really. He&apos;s a good conman, but he isn&apos;t rich. He and his co-conman Lou (Todd Graff) have been down on their luck lately. But things really escalate downwards when a vicious loan shark comes looking for the men. So they rob a home to get some quick cash. While they do so, an answering machine on a desk clicks on. Eddie and Lou listen to find out that not only is the owner away for a month or two, but that the person supposed to be watching the house has called saying he won&apos;t be able to come over to the home, due to a new job in another part of the country. So Eddie and Lou relax in the rich man&apos;s home until Milt Malkin (Robert Loggia) shows up--president of a hair-blowing company. Milt is a distant relative of the homeowner, yet he has never seen him before. Therefore, Milt mistakes Eddie for Jonathan, the owner of the home. Eddie, thinking this is all great, plays as the houseowner...and the shenanigans begin...\n\n&quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; is one of those movies with a decent premise, and some typical eighties&apos; comedies laughs. But even the half-baked laughs soon evaporate as the plot becomes tiring and thin. There gets to be a certain point of Eddie pretending to be someone he isn&apos;t that becomes unfunny.\n\n&quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; is Dana Carvey&apos;s first main starring role. We know what this means. Somewhere in there they&apos;re going to fit in a Bush impersonation. Luckily, they do it quite well, and it proves to be one of the most interesting and amusing, if not hysterical scenes in the film.\n\n &quot;Opportunity Knocks,&quot; despite some average laughs, has a certain charm to it that is attracting. Perhaps it is the characters. Perhaps it is just the style of the film. I&apos;m not sure. It&apos;s just a very charming film. Technically it is very typical, but if you look deeper it has a strange charm to it that is hard not to like. And besides, who cannot like Dana Carvey? Oops, spoke too soon--&quot;Master of Disguise&quot; just popped to mind.\n\nI actually was beginning to really get into this film, before the last quarter or so that is so predictable and stereotypical for the genre that it was quite disappointing.\n\nIn the end, &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; has some good potential, ultimately some good laughs, never reaches its full potential, yet is still charming and worth watching.\n\nHow&apos;s that for a confusing review?\n\n3/5 stars -\n\nJohn Ulmer"

That sorted, I settled down happily for what turned out to be a very enjoyable occult horror movie in a similar vein to Rosemary&apos;s Baby.\n\nAt age 16, Alison Findlay (Samuel) and two school friends decide to hold a seance, contacting Alison&apos;s dead father, who warns his daughter to not attend her 19th birthday party. Despite her friend Chrissie (Margie McCrae) dying during the seance (crushed by a falling bookshelf), Alison seems to forget about the warning, and, a few days before turning 19, travels to the home of her Aunt Jennifer (Bunney Brooke) and Uncle Dean (John Bluthal) to celebrate her impending birthday. Joining Alison for the trip is her boyfriend Peter (Lou Brown), who, as the party draws nearer, comes to believe that Alison is in danger from her Aunt and Uncle, who might not be who they claim to be.\n\nYes, we&apos;ve seen this sort of thing done before, and yes, the story develops as we expect it to, but with likeable leads, a strong supporting cast, and capable direction from Ian Coughlan, plus a neat, downbeat twist ending, what you have is a consistently entertaining 97 minutes of supernatural thrills. Furthermore, zero nudity and gore means that the film is ideal to introduce your kids to the horror genre.\n\n7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",

At some point his 11 year daughter played by Dakota Fanning&apos;s younger sibling unexpectedly turns up at his hotel. And a sign that reads: &quot;Let the bonding begin&quot;.\n\nCappola revisits with this movie her own legacy by making a Lost in Translation II, albeit with significantly less oomph than the successful predecessor starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. &apos;Somewhere&apos; does inspire to the same level of narrative flow (or intentional lack thereof) and it does kind of grow on you as the film progresses. But it never makes the same impact.\n\nThis is however still a watchable film in between the lingering shots that is, with some convincing acting by both Fanning and Stephen Dorff who is casted perfectly for the role.\n\n65/100",

However, in my opinion the movie does not portray the abuse of Sylvia Likens to the extent to fully represent the horror and suffering of her torture. In researching this case, I find the movie &quot;light&quot; on the true depth of this crime. Sylvia Likens had at least 100 burns, contusions, and cuts on her body when she was found. She was starved, placed in scalding baths, and suffered extreme and prolonged abuse. I&apos;m not voyeuristic, but I think that the film really lacks the details of the sequence and scope of events to provide the emotional and intellectual impact that the Likens case calls for. In contrast, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; appears to go a little too far in portraying a couple of events that may not have happened (I hope!) - but I believe that &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; will leave you with a better sense of the true nature of the tragic murder of this young girl."

They decide to throw their fortunes in together and try to escape the Yakuza and an assassin. \n\nThe credit sequence introduces you to the cast of the characters you are about to meet, and it was very worrying... so many characters, I thought &quot;it&apos;s going to get real confusing&quot;, but this is not the case at all. Even though there are a lot of characters, each one is well developed and unique - no problem following who they are and what their relationships are. It&apos;s one hell of a set of characters too... &quot;colourful&quot; hardly seems sufficiently descriptive, but they are all brilliantly conceived and portrayed. The main focus of the movie is the interplay between all these characters, with lots of sharp and witty dialogue throughout, and a generally black humour in the situations they get into and the way they get out of them.\n\n The movie is fast moving... very well paced in fact, and beautifully filmed &amp; edited too. There&apos;s a little bit of violence, but nothing that&apos;s going the slightest concern to anybody who&apos;s seen some Kitano or Miike. Almost wholesome in fact  \n\nIt&apos;s difficult to say what makes the movie so good - it&apos;s not really any one thing - it&apos;s basically just an all-round clever, funny and exceptionally well made movie.

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at the cinema in Israel just after it&apos;s release in 1994. I have an avid interest in the military in general and in the IDF in particular (later doing basic training there). As such this film was fascinating! It was about 5 hours long but seemed shorter. One of the things that I enjoyed about this film was it showed the soldiers as real people, as opposed to the faceless group you always see on the news, normally at a great distance. They talked to famous commanders like General Israel Tal, who were offering a wealth of information on the history and mission of this great organisation. Definitely recommended viewing. I have looked for this film on video/DVD for some years now without success.",

That he is slightly drunk and comfortable and you are experiencing him (or her).\n\nThat&apos;s one place you want to be in your life in films, and it is the basis for many of the film experiences I rate as &quot;must have.&quot;\n\nBut it has all sorts of dangers. The filmmaker must be more than skilled enough to connect, he must be actually interesting, worthwhile, engaged in life in ways that impregnate. There are few films that are well enough sculpted to be entered. And of those, there are few that reward your investing wet parts of your soul to it. You know who the good ones are.\n\nEven then, often you&apos;ll get what you have here, equal parts of fine wine and flat cola. I suppose it is impossible to be otherwise with Nazi-centered soft porn, but Jess Franco (when not drunk) can do pretty well.\n\nThe good here is that once in a while, you&apos;ll encounter some staging with some stark, clear composition and elements that are every bit in the class with Lang or Greenaway. These have ordinary camera positions: non-human in character but human in position. Its the creation of a staged imagination, of dramatic nuance not placed in the actor but in the cinematic frame. (The actors aren&apos;t bad, by the way; its just that the weight of the thing isn&apos;t on their shoulders  or other body parts.)\n\nSome day, commentors like me will be able to provide bookmarks to these scenes so you can experience them without wading through the rotted soup in between. Oh, and that is a ghastly experience, a walk in the dark through greasy fog from one brilliant view through a window to the next.\n\nHey, there&apos;s a story, but never mind. Its as irrelevant, stupid and disposable as its sisters, like &quot;Schindler&apos;s List,&quot; which this resembles in a few ways. And there&apos;s some nudity, though in most cases one wonders why. The chief actress is pretty and very German, different from Brasses usual big-bottomed Italian tigresses.\n\nI&apos;d really like you to see some of the good stuff here. But like much of Bertolucci, you would curse me for sending you there.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

      "description": "The most shocking and controversial of Italian director Tinto Brass&apos; films, SALON KITTY presents a serious, unflinching depiction of moral decay within the Nazi Party at the time of World War II, and of how power ultimately leads to corruption.\r\n\r\nNow, courtesy of Argent Films, the fully restored Director&apos;s Cut of this notorious film is being made available on DVD, presented in its original widescreen format, completely uncensored and featuring 21 minutes of never-seen-before footage. Finally, the extremely disturbing, bordering-on-the-hardcore content of SALON KITTY can be seen as originally intended by the film&apos;s director, Tinto Brass.\r\n\r\nBased on actual events, the story takes place in Berlin, in 1939, at the start of World War II. SS Officer Helmut Wallenburg (Helmut Berger) is instructed by his superiors to set up an elite brothel, the eponymous Salon Kitty, especially designed to serve high-ranking Nazi officials and foreign diplomats. In order to cater to the clients&apos; darkest perversions and desires sufficiently, Wallenburg is also charged with finding and rigorously training twenty beautiful and intelligent women, who are not only dedicated to the ideals of National Socialism but are also prepared to perform the most extreme acts of debauchery imaginable. What these prostitutes and their customers don&apos;t know is that the brothel is bugged and is being used to collect intelligence and to monitor the clients&apos; loyalty to the Nazi Party and its cause. Wallenburg exploits his position, feeding his insatiable need to dominate and using the information he receives to blackmail his way to the top. Meanwhile, one of the prostitutes, Marguerite (Teresa Ann Savoy), discovers the truth about the brothel when a soldier she loves is executed for revealing to her his plans to defect from the Party. With the help of the brothel&apos;s madam, Kitty (Ingrid Thulin), Marguerite plots to turn the tables on Wallenburg and exact her revenge.",

Then, the perfect casting of Bruce &quot;The Chin&quot; Campbell (THE EVIL DEAD 1-3) as decrepit, rest home prisoner, Elvis Presley, and living legend Ossie Davis as fellow inmate, John F. Kennedy clinched the deal.\n\nThe resulting movie is a beautiful experiment in sheer lunacy... that works brilliantly! Campbell shows what made him all-3-Stooges-in-one in EVIL DEAD 2, as his hilarious inner and outer dialogue make up the bittersweet, comedic heart and soul of the film. Obviously, a murderous mummy&apos;s rest home rampage is primo stuff for Campbell.\n\nHowever, what sets this movie apart from other horror comedies is it&apos;s setting, and the way it handles the bleakness of old age. In spite of all of the side-splitting humor and oddness, the true terror lies in growing old and being forgotten, making a cowboy hat-wearing mummy a welcome distraction. Coscarelli captured lightning in a bedpan here. Watching it is like whistling, giggling, and defiantly marching past the graveyard.\n\nEXTRA CREDIT FOR: Ella Joyce as Elvis&apos; no-nonsense nurse..."

      "reviewBody": "Sandy and Danny, their names alone mean nothing, together they represent the film we all know and love that brought us &apos;Summer Nights&apos; and &apos;Greased Lightnin&apos;. Grease is an infamous musical-play turned film, adapted and produced by Allan Carr, chartering the summertastic rock &apos;n&apos; roll of the 1950s, centring on the highs and lows of a group of teenagers at high-school, Rydell High.\n\nThe film begins with two people having a summer romance, Sandy (Newton-John) an uptight, naïve, nerdy Australian girl and Danny (Travolta), a &apos;jack-the-lad&apos; &apos;T&apos; bird. After the opening credits which are amusing cartoons of the main characters we see the two well known groups of teenagers, the Pink Ladies and the &apos;T&apos; Birds going back to school after summer vacation. The rest of the film centres mostly on the relationship of Sandy and Danny, the problems they face, and the ups and downs of their high school chums. The main characters and the unusual pairing of Sandy and Danny makes for comfortable viewing.\n\nMy favourite part of the film is the music, this film has such a brilliant soundtrack. If you have the chance to watch the film on DVD you get the added bonus of a songbook. However with a musical film you do find some parts unrealistic when they sing, why would a group of lads sing Summer Nights for example? Yet that aside the songs, mostly corny love songs are addictive and easy to pick up unfortunately will be in your head all day. Grease may not have had a lavish budget like films made today, but this 1978 film directed by Randal Kleiser still manages to have great audience appeal. Its&apos; scenes and costumes are basic and probably didn&apos;t break the bank to produce but this all adds to the realism of the film.\n\nI like the film and could watch it over and over again. Newton-John&apos;s debut performance is excellent but her character Sandy is too 2D and has no depth. Travolta&apos;s performance is to perfection and this film benchmarked his film career. Danny is 3D, he can be loving, self obsessed, a saviour and a winner, whereas Sandy to me is just a bore. All characters bring something different to the film making it a success. Rizzo is the hard nosed cow, bitchy about Sandy, possibly jealous, who seeks revenge on her boyfriend by going out with his arch enemy. There is also Marcy who loves the men and has lots of boyfriends, and Frenchy who becomes Sandy&apos;s best friend who is caring.\n\nThis uplifting, audience grabbing film may be slightly cheesy but there is just so much to love about it, especially the soundtrack and dance moves! This gives it longevity making it such a great film that could be the best musical ever made. This classic film deserves a 5/5 just for being groovy! But I just can&apos;t stop thinking why is it called Grease?!"

      "reviewBody": "Let me get this straight to begin with: FRANKENSTEIN is a horrible reinterpretation of the classic Mary Shelley novel, which attempts to modernise the story in a pre-flooding New Orleans. Everything about this production screams cliché: there&apos;s a murky, depressing visual style that constantly uses David Fincher&apos;s SE7EN as its source material (isn&apos;t that so late &apos;90s?) and a storyline that ends up going absolutely nowhere. The reason? This was the ill-conceived pilot of a television series that was never made, so don&apos;t go in expecting any kind of plot resolution or tying up of loose ends.\n\nThe tired story sees a couple of lame detectives (Parker Posey and Adam Goldberg, possibly the most uninteresting cops I&apos;ve seen in any movie) going after a killer leaving a string of bizarre deaths in his wake. Along the way, they come across Vincent Perez as a strangely scarred and hooded figure, and there are no prizes for guessing who he&apos;s supposed to be. There&apos;s also some pointless stuff involving ruthless scientist Victor Helios, played by Thomas Kretschmann. He&apos;s Frankenstein, but despite taking up a great deal of screen time he never actually gets involved in the main storyline.\n\nYeah, the film really is that muddled and disjointed: the detectives never catch up with Frankenstein, and we never even learn how he&apos;s still alive in the modern day. Talk about a con. Instead, the thrust of the plot eventually turns out to involve Michael Madsen, playing a fellow detective with a few secrets of his own. But there&apos;s really nothing to keep you watching: no interesting set-pieces, no special effects to speak of, no drama, no tension, not one bit of suspense. Director Marcus Nispel&apos;s work feels adrift and aimless outside of his preferred genre (remakes), and Dean Koontz wisely took his name off the thing. You can hardly blame him.",

Also convinced my friends to go along with me hoping that the movie would be good enough.\n\nI won&apos;t say I had hopes of watching something of &quot;maula jatt&quot; level as I had already noticed some shortcomings in the trailer but the movie was a complete flop. There was no proper character development, the acting was so bad by most of the cast ( had some exceptions like GURU, LAQQA and hamza ali abbasi) and there was no point to it.\n\nThe fight sequences ughhh... the first fight scene in the park was so badly choreographed that even small youtubers make better sequences than that.\n\nI am student at NUST university where some of the scenes were shot and that added to my excitement but it left me very disappointed.\n\nI am giving it a 4 because of the vfx effects and the effort they put on for visuals, but i hope they focus more on the story if there are any plans of a sequel.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Radio Patrol&quot; is a decent chapterplay derived from a comic strip and stars the stolid and dependable Grant Withers. The action revolves around the efforts to keep a radical new steel formula out of criminal hands. A standout in the serial is the city in which the story takes place. Not only does it have all the charm of a typical mid-century noir urban environment, it also has a thriving ethnic area. Instead of the usual Chinatown or European ghetto, we have an Arabian sector, a &quot;Little Cairo&quot; lifted from Egypt and featuring all the intrigue and exoticism you would expect from such an unusual locale. The chapterplay is fast-paced and action-filled. Fans of chapterplays, crime stories and comic strips will find &quot;Radio Patrol&quot; well worth the effort.",

There are some films included that have never been shown elsewhere or that are the only ones of their kind in existence. A couple of the early boxers, John L. Sullivan for example, are shown here in the only film ever taken of them. The film of the Dempsey-Willard fight is very violent. The history of Jack Johnson out of the ring is quite interesting. The narrator incorrectly states that Jack Johnson is seen picking a defeated boxer&apos;s teeth out of one of his gloves. That&apos;s at the end of pretty bloody fight. The attire worn by some of the early boxers is much more revealing than what modern-day boxers use, and to the other extreme, tights were even worn by some boxers.",

You can imagine that my expectations were quite low: a 5.2 out of 10 isn&apos;t that much and the 3 reviews out there were so critical. I decided to see it anyway imagining that I will at least have a different experience given that the movies I normally watch are Hollywood productions. I must say I actually enjoyed it! I took it as a comedy, not as a documentary! I saw people were complaining about the fact that the situations were highly unlikely or that the movie was inspired from a book and it didn&apos;t do it justice. Well movies rarely succeed in doing that as far as I know... Books and movies are 2 distinct experiences! I liked the fact that there was little or no vulgarity and a complete lack of fart/bodily fluids/coarse sex jokes that I see too often! I don&apos;t find those funny! It&apos;s way more difficult to make people laugh because of funny circumstances or truly intelligent or sarcastic lines! To wrap it up without giving anything away, take it as a light-hearted comedy and don&apos;t have too high expectations - you might actually enjoy it ;)",

      "reviewBody": "When I first put this on for my girls I thought I&apos;d bought a rip off of a Barbie film or something! This is so unlike any of the other Barbie films. I have sat through all of them with my daughter with a little bit of guilty pleasure as the songs are usually fun and the story lines are well thought out. As another reviewer mentioned, the voice acting is awful and almost painful to listen to. The story line is basic and it just seems like they must have really rushed this film to get it out in time for Christmas as there was so little thought that went into it.\n\nThey definitely need to take a step back towards their older films. I disliked the changes they made recently by giving them all giant heads (!) and they always did the classic stories very well. Having said that most of the films have been fairly fun and entertaining. This was not. They definitely need to bring back Kelly Sheridan for the voice acting. \n\nHowever, for a 5 year old this was good viewing. My children enjoyed it though I don&apos;t think (and hope) that it won&apos;t be one that gets chosen all the time.",

      "reviewBody": "Julian has lived off with the money he lures from his rich female customers. But now he faces usurious debts from a hasty expansion of his business, and he will be killed unless he clears the debt in one month. The only way to save himself is to pretend to be the long-lost brother of an heiress and kill her to get her huge fortune. Min, the blind heiress, cold-hearted like Julian, slowly opens herself to him, and he, too, falls for her. But Julian has to pay his creditor and what makes it worse for him is that the illness that took Min&apos;s eyesight relapsed, threatening her life. Reporter: How were you cast in the movie &quot;I Don&apos;t Need Love&quot; (&quot;Love Me Not&quot;)?\n\nMoon Geun-young: I watched the Japanese TV drama in CDs in my management firm&apos;s office when I came to Seoul after finishing the college entrance exam and found it very attractive. Maybe it&apos;s because there was an affinity between me at that time and the Ryu Min character.\n\nReporter: An affinity with the depressed character? You are so sunny and positive.\n\nMoon: Well, it&apos;s distrust in the world. I had received rewards for the efforts I made, and I lost any desire to do something when I wasn&apos;t rewarded for doing my best in preparing for the exam. I felt I could express what was pressing me down inside through Min.\n\nReporter: The evaluation of your acting in this movie seems significant.\n\nMoon: I&apos;m waiting for it. I&apos;ll accept anything: reproaches, critiques, or advice. That&apos;s what I can do and must do because I&apos;m now in my 20s. It will be an opportunity to take one step further.\n\nReporter: What do you think your weaknesses are as an actor?\n\nMoon: There are a lot. I feel I&apos;m not good enough in doing the basics like speaking, breathing, voice tones, facial expressions, actions and delivering emotions.\n\nReporter: Don&apos;t you have any desire to be in the so-called &quot;boring art movies&quot;?\n\nMoon: Frankly speaking, I&apos;ve had it. But I also think it is the right thing to do now to show what I can do best at my age. I don&apos;t want to consume myself fast. I want to go slowly.\n\nReporter: Last year, you said, &quot;An actor can become anything except oneself&quot;. It sounded a little sad.\n\nMoon: I wished who I am in my fantasy were real me because I didn&apos;t like real me. I wished I had certain aspects of the character I&apos;m acting, so I tried to find them within me. I found I didn&apos;t have them and felt I&apos;m not myself.",

Don&apos;t let the fact that it went straight to video dissuade you.\n\nIt is not a pretty movie. Watching the effects of child sexual abuse never is. Watching someone engage in self-mutilation to mask the pain is, in a word, painful.\n\nBello (A History of Violence, The Cooler) was, of course, perfect for the role. Rufus Sewell played the husband, who was more of an enigma. It was never clear whether he was just a jerk who was obsessed with golf, or if 15 years of marriage to Nancy (Bello) just wore him down.\n\nNancy finds Louis (Jason Patric), someone on the Internet she wants to kill her. They end up having a relationship, if you want to call it that.\n\nIn the end, I am not sure whether he kills her or whether she kills herself. It really doesn&apos;t matter. It was a dark, twisted film with very little music and washed out cinematography. It set the mood, but it is easy to see why this film would get no buyers at Sundance.\n\nPeople don&apos;t go to the movies to get more depressed, and this one will do just that.",

All are present and correct, making this pic solid enough entertainment.\n\nOkay, so the plot is pretty basic, and consists of characters escaping from one danger to another, and another, but with this budget what do you expect? The cast are all adequate, with Mortensen probably being most memorable as the cop. Stallone basically sleepwalks through his role, but it&apos;s the mumbling action man persona his fans know and love, and it&apos;s good to see him as an actual human hero (he&apos;s gasping and clutching his chest through exertion).\n\nThere&apos;s plenty of excitement to be had from numerous explosions, the old staple of the trapped survivors being in a location filling up with water, and also you get the opportunity to play the &quot;who&apos;s going to snuff it?&quot; game, where viewers place bets on who will be the next one to die. Let me say, it&apos;s not the dog, but then you could probably have already guessed that. With good SFX and some exciting, tense scenes, DAYLIGHT amicably passes the time if you want a film to relax and unwind with.",

Now my favorite character wasn&apos;t in the movie very much.  I have tried to imitate his life as much as possible.  He is the little actor who beat out the main character for president.  I believe he can be seen on Malcolm in the Middle and the newest series of All That.  This movie is great for parties and I highly recommended this.  At first we where all against it but once we watched we laughed and cried."

The plot, already described elsewhere, is ludicrous, the set looks like somebody&apos;s basement, and the effects are cheap.\n\nIt&apos;s always worth seeing Karloff, but otherwise the only attraction is the supporting cast which includes various beautiful women, including Isele Vega (best known for &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot;), who are called upon to add some sex to the mix. The lesbian scenes make no sense within the context of the story, but they may at least prevent you from fast-forwarding to the conclusion.",
