Travellers purchasing tickets worth $6(For young people 18-64 age \ngroup) may enjoy round trip to its both connected stations. We family \nmembers, utilising its another special feature, after reaching to the Pikes Market, another end of the Space Needle Centre, we enjoyed Market places. We also had a walk to the costal area of the Seattle Port, situated on the Pacific Ocean. While returning to station back we had a cup of Expresso Coffee from the oldest counter of the Starbucks Coffee shop.As expecteded the taste of the Expresso Coffee was not as tasty as expected.It's also may be a reason that we are not accustomed with the method of mixing cream and other supplements in proper proportions, which may resulted in bad taste. \n   We after walking away from the ups and downs of the streets of the famous Pikes Market and surroundings we reached back to the Pikes Market Mono Rail station and enjoyed ride back to the Space Needle Centre. No, doubt  the Seattle Space Needle Centre is a most exciting sample of the distinct structure of the Architecture at the heart of the Seattle City. It was came to know that this structure has been carved on the Canada's pattern. People were discussing that in every city of Canada such types of raised structures are the place of attraction for the tourists. Near the Space Needle Centre homeless people were attracted as a band party playing musical instruments and dancing on music. Though, they entertained up to extent with their ultimate motive to get tips for their livelihood.Finally came back to our rresidence.\n        The Mono Rail round trip remained a pleasourous ride."

This was a hint of things to come.\nThe driver was horrible. I have video of him on his phone while driving down the highway. According to the GPS in my phone he drove (traffic permitting) 5 to 15mph OVER the speed limit the entire trip, in the rain and on mountain roads. Several times I felt the tires \"Slip\". Twice he violently swerved to avoid hitting a vehicle in the lane he was trying to merge into. He went left of center over a double yellow line and off the right onto the berm so many times I lost count. Leaving Seattle the rear A/C was so cold people where bundled up in their coats and he never asked if we were comfortable. During our return trip he could not get the rear A/C to work and we were hot all the way back. The topper was the van was filthy. The windows were dirty. The floor was dirty. The ashtrays were full of trash.\nI would only recommend this trip as a gift to someone you hate and never want to see again."

I don’t know about you, but when I am on vacation I want to take pictures of the area. We had to go to China Town for our pick up. The pick up\nSpot was filthy, no businesses were open, the buildings were sprayed with gang graffiti and the driver pulled up, an ounces Leavenworth? Get in.  No Hello, how are, nothing. I think he wanted to get out of the neighborhood as bad as we all did.  The van was dirty, the inside of the windows were sticky from fingerprints, the ashtrays were full of past passengers wrappers, the floors had food particles in the seat legs. The driver did a slight explanation of the trip, gave us a verbal list of don’t do this, and drove so erratically and fast that even my husband was concerned over the drivers ability. Then we were forced to pay a $10 per person “service fee” aka tip. \nThe Falls, nice area, but when we arrived for our 15 minute stop, the gift shop and museum were closed.  Thank goodness the restroom was open because we wouldn’t be stopping for another 2 hours. \nThe Bavarian Village is disappointing. If you have ever been to Germany you will be disappointed. But if you like Italian, Mongolian and Americanized Bavarian food you will not be disappointed. The shops made me feel like I was at a flea market although there were a couple nice ones. The most we bought was a disappointing schnitzel sandwich on a soft bun with Swiss cheese and kraut and red potatoes as the side.  Not very authentic. \nFor the 6 hours on the road, and 2 -3 hours in the village, I would suggest skipping this tour and save your money. "

    "description": "Believe it or not, there is an old-growth forest in Seattle! We start at my favorite viewpoint in the city, perfect for your Instagram feed. Then we cruise the scenic shores of Lake Washington and learn the incredible history of how it was “re-plumbed” while on our way to Seward Park for fantastic views of Mt. Rainier (if the mountain is out!). This park is an incredible gem holding one of only 2 old-growth stands left in the city. The trail through the old-growth is flat, less than 1 mile long and it’s ‘flip-flop accessible’ We can walk as much or as little as you like. After that, let's get coffee in the beautiful, historic Columbia City neighborhood. This tour is mostly on foot, so wear your comfy shoes and appropriate weather gear. \n\nWith a max of 3 people, this is a personal \"best of Seattle\" tour that explores the places most visitors never see, places I take my friends and family when they visit! For a private version (1 to 4 people) please call/text 206-717-5797",

I would highly recommend this tour for anyone who enjoys being outdoors and learning about some cool history of Seattle."

It was fun to see the neighborhoods of Seattle, take a walk in the old growth forest, see the shores of Lake Washington and Pudget Sound.  In between we were given golden nuggets of information to be used that day as well as throughout our stay.  \nWe took her advice to use the ferry to see the sound, go to Bainbridge Island and do so for just over $8 per ticket.  We had a great time.  In addition, Lynn provided us cold bottled water, homemade ice tea (my wife loved it) and we had a local fruit and cheese stash while sitting on the beach and watching for otters and whales.  Could not give Lynn enough 5 stars!!!!"

As she is a native Seattle citizen for around 30 years she knows a lot about this city and its inhabitants. She explains everything in a very friendly, entertaining way and has a comprehensive knowledge of the city and places, that sweeping tourists are unlikely to see. On these tours (Lake, Old Growth Trees and Beach Tour) you may get to learn Seattle and nature surrounding Seattle. Together with Lynn we walked along Seattle Beach, had a typical American pick nick there, saw old trees, stones, Blue Herons, seals, hummingbirds and took a lot of amazing nature photos. \nBut the park with really high and old trees is amazing with moss and ferns everywhere. So if you are interested in both, the city of Seattle and surrounding nature your first choice should be a tour of Seattle under the Radar with Lynn. \nThank you Lynn for your patience while we taking so many pictures.\n\nK. and H."

It was the perfect start because I really wanted to see grunge-related places and she was excited to exceed my expectations. Lynn is super smart and shared knowledge that was relevant and interesting. I loved every stop including the quick stops for fantastic pics. Easy Street Records was a must-do and she pointed out so many more cool things that I would have missed. She allowed time for my purchases and for an ice cream. We had a yummy snack at Lincoln Park and we ended the day strolling in Alki Beach. Highly recommend Lynn and this tour."

Starbucks isn't the only good coffee.  My cappuccino with a shot a hazelnut was not over frothy, but perfect, smooth and delicious.  After a few minutes of chit-chat, Lynn took me on a worldwide tour of West Seattle.  I learned so much and her time and attention to detail is the absolute best.  Lynn is passionate about Seattle and it comes through again and again with each tidbit of information she shares with you.  When I told her that I am looking to possibly move to Seattle in a few years, she offered a ton of suggestions and I knew that I had to return, just to sign up for more of her tours.  And just when I thought it was over, she took me to this fabulous Seattle based chocolatier, where all of my will power went out the window and I loaded up on the good stuff.  After a day with Lynn, you will come to truly love and embrace the city of Seattle. \n\nHopping on a bus with other strangers is not a bad idea.  I did it, however, if you want an up close and personal, intimate touch, then I strongly encourage you to check out Lynn Curtis.  I know that I will reach out to her again!!!!"

She had lovingly prepared an itinerary for us that took us through the city. We saw the house boats, Gasworks Park, Kerry Park, the area around Pike Street, and many more interesting sights and parts of the city. There was time to step into the famous Elliot Bay bookstore, too. It was a very fun and educational experience for my daughters.\nAsk her to tell you about seeing Alice in Chains in her dorm basement! Highly recommended."

Along the way, we will check out a few of Seattle’s best book stores, some great record shops, sample locally made ice cream and confections, enjoy the best espresso in the city (in my opinion!) and see some of the most famous bars and live music venues in the city. This is a great way to plan your weekend agenda while in town if nightlife is your thing. These are the places I take my friends and family when they visit, I'd like to share them with you.\n\nWith a max of 3 people, this is a personal \"best of Seattle\" tour that explores the places most visitors never see.

She immediately brought us to Vivace, which I was very familiar with, but she recommended a drink that I have never heard of, which is now a drink that makes me want to go back to Capitol Hill! Then she brought us all over different areas that I never thought to go and showed me an amazing history that I never knew. Then we went to some of the local bars, but still she schooled me with really cool facts that I never would have known!

The whole tour was relaxed but not too slow, and I loved that we got to ask so many questions due to the small tour size.

Knowledgeable about the city, the history and the region, we had the best tour en famille we have ever had. Comfortable vehicle. Safe driver, very attentive to our questions ( of which there were many!). To see Seattle from the perspective of a local professional guide (Bryan has been doing this for over 14 years ...his skill is evident !) was worth every penny. In our time together we toured all the major areas and neighborhoods in with great detail and to the \"characters\" that built Seattle's industries and technologies. Viewing the city from many vista outlook areas gave the true perspective on the lay of the land. From Pike's Market area, through the business centers to the glorious residential areas to the port areas, we now understand the magic that Seattle holds for the citizens. For anyone taking a vacation here or a cruise from the port, THIS tour is THE tour to reserve. Customized to whatever wants to see that come up during our conversations. \"Let me show you that area\" was the credo. Yes, Bryan has his sights he wishes to ensure we see, but he went out of his way for a couple mystical areas like t6he floating homes ( and floating bridges) and the lakes areas. Thank you Bryan D. for a day to remember and nan education about your fine city. Bravo! Highly recommended. A MUST do tour ...  \"fer sure eh\" as we might say as Canadian guests ! Merci beaucoup de Montreal to Seattle."

Also would recommend wearing comfy clothes and avoiding jeans or anything that would be uncomfortable to break a bit of a sweat in! The waterfalls were gorgeous and the forest really was magnificent. We also liked getting to see some of the small towns we passed by while driving up towards the hike.

He was very patient. He provided all the tools we needed to go for a little hike. I can say that the elevation did cause me to feel alittle sick . Farshid, was there to make sure that my medications were sufficient and if I needed any further assistance, he was able to help. I really appreciate the patience and understanding we were able to finish the trip. It was beautiful and well worth every dime. I will do it again when I come back to Seattle. thank you so much!"

Then we traveled to North Bend to explore the Twin Peaks filming location and savor the iconic Cherry pie from the RR,  at the RR Twede’s  cafe. I cannot say enough about Slav.  He went so above and beyond for each of us.  He was very knowledgeable about so many plants and EVERYTHING.  Parts of our tour we could not do because of winter weather but Slav made sure he compensated us and we loved every second of the day.  Very special thanks to Slav.   Highest recommendation I can give."

The cheapest choice is not always the best.   The owner Daniel had reached out to us because of cancelations that left just my wife and myself on the tour.  He said that he had other options but not the Mount Rainier as it was just the two of us.  As we told him that was really what we had our hearts set on that we would just look else where, he would not have that. He wanted us to see Mount Rainier.   We ended up with a personal tour by the owner himself and it could have not been better.  It was absolutely breathtaking and beautiful.  Never felt rushed and Daniel was always ready for photos and any needs we wanted.  After our cruise we had 1 additional day to explore Seattle so of course it was an easy choice to reach back out to Oktaytours.  We were picked up from the cruise port and after our Best of Seattle Tour that day, they dropped us off at the airport.  Special thanks to Vlad for a great tour.\n\nThe Martins"

He was open to customizing our tour and made 9-10 stops with interpretive and historical knowledge.  Vlad allowed us as much time at each stop and we never felt rushed.  The tour included 2 other people who were also very friendly and willing to go with the flow.  Mt. Rainier is a very special place and deserves respect and admiration and Vladimir made sure our trip included as much time and awareness to get a full feeling of the majestic Mt. Rainier National Park.  Worth every penny!!!"

    "description": "The one and only tour of Seattle you'll ever need - in just 45 minutes! Explore the city's rich history, stopping by world-famous attractions and some hidden gems. We'll stretch our legs, do some food shopping in Pike Place Market - and build some uniquely Seattle snacks that showcase local cuisine and history!\n\nGuests love this tour because...\n1) We keep our group size small\n2) We have folks in and out in 45 minutes\n3) We eat awesome food you won't stumble across on your own\n4) Our guides love sharing local recommendations! Want to know where to get sushi? Where to grab a drink? How to get from A to B? We got you.\n\nMy goal is that at the end of the tour you will not only see some beautiful sites, but also understand how all that history shaped Seattle into the city it is today. This is the most fun \"lunch & learn\" you've ever attended!",
