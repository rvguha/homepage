      "reviewBody": "This is the sort of movie that will do if nothing else is on, but don&apos;t expect too much of it. I guess there is only one good reason to watch it and that is Kim Basinger. I really can&apos;t come up with something better.\n\nThis is a typical Hollywood bank robbery movie. Nothing wrong with that when it is done right, but The Real McCoy never gets above the average in the genre. The characters as well as the script are average and very shallow. You never get rid of the feeling that you know what is going to happen ... only to see a few minutes later that your feeling didn&apos;t betray you.\n\nThe bank robbery is perhaps the biggest disappointment. It&apos;s unbelievable how these top criminals always seem to know how to avoid every security system thanks to all the gadgets they use (they would make James Bond blush like a little school girl). And then of course we still have the security guards that look like a bunch of idiots that just want to be fooled. Spice this up with a love story that never really takes off and a lot of emotions about a little boy and you know what kind of movie this is.\n\nI just wasn&apos;t thrilled after seeing it. I reward it with a 5/10. It just isn&apos;t worth more. Too bad.",

This is a well made, well acted story that has a weird mix of humor and thrills. You have the crooks trying to steal the invention which is very good, and then you have things like the character of the dopey bill collector who seems to come from a very good broad comedy. The problem is that the two styles don&apos;t really blend and you end up with a movie thats neither, as well as being just sort of okay. Its a bland affair that never really held my attention.\n\nWorth trying if you run across it, but probably not worth running out to get.",

Thank goodness for Frances McDormand, whose superb acting makes this movie watchable long after the scenes start repeating themselves. Catherine Keener and Joan Cusack are also very good to watch, even if their roles do not allow for much development. Jennifer Anniston&apos;s role and her ability to carry the part are both severely flawed: Anniston brings absolutely no personality to the part, and the part itself doesn&apos;t ever really develop. For this movie, it&apos;s a fatal predicament, since Anniston&apos;s role is the central one.",

      "reviewBody": "The pace is set from the opening scene: the ocean with its consistent but gentle force splashing against the shore.  `Message in a Bottle&apos; follows this leisurely pace; it is not in a real hurry to give up all its secrets, but like the ocean, will surrender all in good time.  So relax, and allow yourself to enjoy!\n\nPaul Newman (Dodge Blake) and Kevin Costner (Garrett Blake) both deliver strong performances as father and son, initially content, though not really happy in their current existence.  Both have lost their love, for one reason or another, and are each other&apos;s companion and support.  Newman gets the fun punch lines, Costner gets the woman.  `If I were about 150 years younger&apos; starts one of Newman&apos;s lines  it must be different for him not to play the leading role.  Costner seems right at home playing a ship-building sailor who is lost because of his lost love.\n\nRobin Wright (Theresa Osborne) is equally strong, playing an independent and patient reporter, who follows her heart, and decides to find the author of the love letters from the ocean.  She gives Garrett distance gently when he needs it, yet pushes back equally hard when she needs to.\n\nMuch of the acting relied not so much on the delivery of lines, as on the body language, on looks, on the strained silence between a couple who is unsure of each other, often unsure of themselves, yet strongly attracted to each other.\n\nBoth Garrett and Theresa seem to struggle at conversation, both uncertain of how to discover each other, yet each finding an attraction they can&apos;t seem to deny.  Garrett is hanging on to the love he still feels for his wife, who died too early.  Theresa is still recovering from a divorce, and the busy life of a single parent.  Neither is sure they can be open to a new relationship, nor are they ready to say goodbye to something that is starting to feel so right.\n\nThe photography of the sailboats on the ocean were enough to bring out the romantic in me.  What could be a more peaceful setting than a sailboat anchored privately in a small cove of the ocean in the Outer Banks?.  We&apos;re given just enough peek into the unfolding world of a couple discovering love, without it feeling like an intrusion.\n\nTo talk more of the ups and downs would give away too many of the secrets that only the theatre, the bookstore, or the ocean will release.",

      "reviewBody": "No living director anywhere can build creeping, gnawing, raw nerve anticipatory tension like Kurosawa. Aside from that? Well, it&apos;s a mixed bag. His new film, English title &quot;Loft&quot;, twists slowly on your skin early on, digging deeper and deeper. And then it sort of just stops. The shallow breathed fear that he creates, having you flinch at every movement in delicious tension (What&apos;s that! Oh, it&apos;s a TV. Wait! What&apos;s THAT! Oh, just a shadow) is unique. His mastery of composition in the frame, of scene, setting, character movement, sound, are unparalleled. And in this he sets himself up. There would have to be one hell of a harrowing finale to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion. As it is, &quot;Loft&quot; creeps up on you, hypnotizing you in fear; and then it just waits a while, and creeps back away. Not to say that the (lengthy) conclusion is poor, in any other movie it would be great. He twists several cliché horror staples in unique ways, and even finds some delirious humor. But it just doesn&apos;t work well enough. You almost feel the plot stumble and come close to falling. Kurosawa&apos;s brilliance with horror is that he does not scare you with sudden movements, grotesque images and stunts. He creates dread, primal and powerful. His horror slowly leans over your shoulder until it stares you in the eye. Unfortunately, in &quot;Loft&quot;, the audience wins the staring contest.",

This film begins with the credits shown over a book with its pages being turned by a hand reminding me of Jeanne Cocteau&apos;s beginning for Beauty and the Beast (1946). Tullio (Giancarlo Gianni) is an aristocrat married to Laura Antonelli but he fools around shamelessly with Jennifer O&apos;Neil. He&apos;s a bullshit artist at high speed, but one day he gets his come-uppance. He seems not to care about Antonelli&apos;s feelings, and one day she cheats on him with a novelist/writer. She is left pregnant, and Tullio is devastated. He cannot accept the child (who all thinks is his own). Visconti&apos;s films always have a certain disdain for rich people, and here his contempt is risen to art while telling a very engaging story. Gianni&apos;s performance is powerful stuff, while Antonelli is both beautiful and sad in equal measures. Not as good as Death in Venice but excellent nonetheless.",

      "reviewBody": "What distinguishes stage from screen?  If a viewer had only Brian Friel&apos;s play, `Dancing at Lughnasa&apos; and its cinematic adaptation to judge from, he or she might be tempted to answer that, while stage is highly engaging and meaningful, screen is superficial, insulting, and thin in content.  Friel&apos;s play is structured in such a way that a film version necessarily provides a fascinating comparison of the two mediums.   However, director Pat O&apos;Connor&apos;s efforts tend to demonstrate the weaknesses of cinema rather than the strengths.  Adapting a play to the screen has often proved to be a tricky business; it involves some pitfalls which this film does not manage to avoid.\n\nScreen is extremely literal.  It allows for--in fact, often demands-- a sense of realism seldom conveyed on stage.  The makers of `Dancing at Lughnasa&apos; are clearly appreciative of this fact, and have made valiant, if not always successful, allowances for it.  The primary result of their efforts is a heightened sense of setting.  The world these characters inhabit feels real.  We get shot after shot of Irish countryside; set and costume design seem perfect for Ireland in the 1930s.  Mark Geraghty&apos;s production design is one of the best things about this film.  Additionally, excellent accent work by all the actors proves perfectly convincing and adds depth to the setting.\n\nHowever, such a literal medium has its drawbacks.  In particular, young Michael&apos;s narration, which was used to achieve a specific effect in the play, seems unnecessary here.  The play&apos;s Michael is full-grown and speaks young Michael&apos;s lines as his `memories&apos; take place in the action on stage. The film makers did well to recognize that there was no cinematic equivalent for this; having the adult narrator speak the child&apos;s lines would have seemed ridiculous.  However, in removing that aspect of the narrator&apos;s role, they stripped away most of his significance, as well.  The film&apos;s narrator seems like an afterthought, occasionally intruding into the action to tell us that what we are seeing is a memory.  We could easily forget that the events are, in fact, happening in flashback.\n\nWhile some of the abstract elements of Friel&apos;s original play do not translate well onto the screen, individual performances are only aided by the medium.  Since film is not hindered by the simple vocal requirements of stage, the actors are able to convey much more subtlety of meaning.  The players in this film version are, without exception, excellent.  Meryl Streep stands out as the proper, reserved Kate.  Her manner is nervous and slightly shrill, but conveys genuine concern for her sisters.  When Kate opens up and allows herself to dance, Streep shows a joyful abandon which is believable and pleasant to see.  Another standout performance is delivered by Michael Gambon in the role of Father Jack.  His lines are spoken with calm assurance, betraying Jack&apos;s senility only by their complete lack of relevance.  Gambon&apos;s distant eyes and quiet detachment reinforce the feeling that he exists in a world entirely different from the rest of the family, a point which is absolutely crucial to his character.  Supporting characters are also portrayed dead-on.  This film has some of the best acting that could have been hoped for.\n\nDespite these considerable advantages, the movie runs into trouble when it tries to adapt Friel&apos;s plot to the screen.  Film is so much more visual than theater that it demands a great deal of variation in order to keep the viewer interested.  Since we do not have the benefit of the actors&apos; physical presence, we need other things to hold our attention.  In attempting to add variety to the play&apos;s structure, screenwriter Frank McGuinness breaks up Friel&apos;s original dialogue into smaller scenes, most of which involve household chores.  McGuinness also tries to represent some events which the play&apos;s dialogue only alludes to.  The result is a film which is so fragmented that we lose sight its content.  Friel&apos;s dialogue is integrally important to his play, and the same is true for the film.  However, the way that the film breaks up this dialogue among tiny scenes is extremely distracting.  We lose sight not only of the dialogue&apos;s meaning, but of the relationships between characters.  Since the adapted structure requires that the five sisters rarely appear in the same scene together, it is very difficult to get any sense of the dynamic in the household.  Ultimately, so much time is spent with action rather than dialogue that the characters lose a great deal of their depth.  Perhaps film makers did not trust their audience to be as interested in the characters as in the events.\n\nIt is somewhat unjust to evaluate an adapted play simply in light of the original.  However, this cinematic version fails to hold up even on its own terms.  It is difficult to conceive what value those who have not been exposed to the original play could see in this adaptation.  What we get is a good-looking, but ultimately insubstantial, portrait of five women who could all stand to let their hair down a little bit more than they do.  I can&apos;t help but think that Friel had more in mind than demonstrating the value of letting one&apos;s hair down.",

I grew up with the wonderful &apos;80s TV miniseries Anne of Green Gables with Megan Follows. It&apos;s more faithful to the book and no doubt purists will prefer that. Still, this is an entertaining film with a charming performance from Anne Shirley, who took her stage name from this character. It&apos;s amusing that young Anne&apos;s being homely is referenced several times when the actress Anne Shirley is one of the prettiest to ever grace the screen. She&apos;s also one of classic Hollywood&apos;s most underrated talents. I&apos;ve never seen a bad performance from her. She ended her career at the age of 27. Her last film was the classic Murder, My Sweet. Not a bad movie to go out on. As for this one, the last 15 minutes or so squeezes a lot in and it&apos;s not as strong as the start but it&apos;s still a very enjoyable film.",

It is a decent enough performance, but barely matches the high standards of his earlier performances.\n\nThe film itself is typical &apos;60s Cold War stuff, with a complex plot and lots of cloak and dagger treachery. Clift plays a scientist who is blackmailed into working as a spy behind the Iron Curtain. His cover is dangerously thin from the beginning, but by the end it has been blown wide open and he has to flee for his life. Indeed, the film only really comes to life during that final half hour or so. The build up is mildly intriguing, but not sufficiently so to make this a great film. The location photography helps to give the film a sense of authenticity, if nothing else.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend The Defector to anyone other than spy afficianados or fans of Montgomery Clift.",

A simple story, but wonderfully told - with warm and endearing characters. Wahlgren and Sjöström tell the tale of a much-loved bear who is lost a few days before Christmas - and the little girl who owns him is inconsolable. The story is told from both the little girl&apos;s point of view, and also from the view of &apos;Noo Noo&apos; the teddy bear.\n\nFull of warm characters, the story relies on visuals as much as the dialogue, with some wonderful shots of a white, Swedish Christmas. The sub-plot of family reunion at Christmas is well handled, without being intrusive, and dovetails nicely into the main story.\n\nUnderplayed, like most Nordic movies, this still brings a lump to my throat at the very satisfying conclusion every time I watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "Visually stunning, extremely rich in detail, fast action sequences, innovative camera movements, and an historic interpretation of afro-americans settling in the west in the late 800&apos;s, this movie is highly unconventional.  The more recent &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; has some similarities, &quot;The Ballad of Cable Houge&quot; comes to mind.  Using comedy, fantasy, surrealism, the plot has a group of afro-americans traveling with a case of gold, chased by a posse.  They join a settlement of afro-americans in the West, which while free by law, are reminded by the neighboring white towns that their liberty of action does not border out of their free town, and their law does not apply to white people.  In a poignant scene, the only white man, who was in the original group of afro-americans with the case of gold, is brutally killed in public view by the white neighbors, almost to demonstrate that a white folk that joins the black folks has reached his lowest social status, lower that simply a black man, which by law cannot be killed without reason."

Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and John Carradine are the big four, and their presence alone makes seeing this film a must.  I don&apos;t think any other film had three of these men in the same film, same time, and same scenes(Scream and Scream Again has Lee, Cushing, and Price, but Cushing does not share screen time with either Lee or Price).  The men are all still great to see and brought a flood of nostalgia to me as they made their entrances into the film.  The film, however, is weak, and there really is no denying that.  I like the film because of the four boogeymen, but cannot say in good faith that it is a good film.  It is not.  The story concerns an author having a bet with his publisher to stay in a creepy place and produce a book in one evening for twenty thousand dollars.  It is a very worn plot, and to make matters worse, the scriptwriter butchers his way through the script trying to squeeze out anything that might have been thoughtful and original.  The male lead is none other that that master thespian Desi Arnaz Jr.  I know hearing his name makes you tingle with anticipation, but this man has no clue how to perform.  Plainly put, he is awful, and painful to watch as he delivers hackneyed dialogue with a smug manner.  He certainly canot hold his own with the reverent cast or even female character actress Shelia Keith who really shines in her small role.  Some of the dialogue is funny, some serious, but there are only four reasons to watch this film:  Price, Cushing, Lee, and Carradine.  They put in this film what little life this film has.  Of the four, watch for Vincent Price playing ever the ham!  He is superb."

      "reviewBody": "This series has become a genre in itself, and therefore, people will like it or hate it. Personally, seeing the original COTC when I was growing up, it was not a great movie, but it had originality back in the era of Jason, Michael and Freddy.\n\nIt also tapped into childhood car trips into the country, with all the country sounds and smells, and of course, the claustrophobia of endless open spaces (which this movie breaks with to it&apos;s detriment, with it&apos;s mountain background), with rows and rows of corn, just too high to see over. This what the concept _does_ have going for it.\n\nNow, it&apos;s just another vehicle for unknown actors to cut their teeth on, instead of daytime soap. Eva Mendez stands out, though, and her portrayal of Kir is both sensitive and fragile, while she is gorgeous to look at. She is being set up, though, and her killing herself over a boyfriend makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nBecause of the stale concept, there is very little suspense just there, and the director doesn&apos;t add any, either. You _know_ there is a cornfield possessed by a demon and a horde of &quot;telepathic&quot; children doing most of the killing for him. This being based  on the 80&apos;s slasher concept, you also know that most of the protagonists are going to die. And they do. There&apos;s no suspense in that. Also, little Adam Wylie needs a lot more acting lessons.\n\nWhat this series needs is more titanic battles, more ambivalent leads, more esoteric lore and simply more imagination on the part of the writers (plural). And a bigger budget too (which the original didn&apos;t have either). With the X-Files series running for 5 years now, I think there has been an over-exposure of horror, and what could shock in a movie a decade ago, now is something you&apos;re likely to see for free on week night television."

The best documentaries provide both (or more) sides of the story, show the conflict, allow the emotions to speak and inspire the viewer to decide or research further. Director Gaylen Ross does just that with this terrifying tale of truth ... a truth left open to interpretation.\n\nRezso Kasztner arranged for the rescue of 1684 Jews. That much is known. The bone chilling debates occur when one views him as a hero and the other views him as a traitor - a collaborator with the Nazi&apos;s (specifically Adolph Eichmann). Kasztner has been referred to as the Jewish Schindler, but also as the man who sold his soul to the devil.\n\nMs. Ross provides us access to many sources including his probable assassin! When this admitted killer sits down with Kasztner&apos;s family, it proves the adage that truth is stranger than fiction. His family, especially his daughter, are on a mission to see him portrayed as the hero they see. The problem is that many, including some of those he rescued, see him as a Nazi collaborator and are unable to forgive.\n\nSo many fine moments and interviews in this one that it actually left me wanting more. Somehow we never really got to know Kasztner as a man, but I do walk away admiring his daughter and granddaughter for working to get their side of the story out, and even more amazingly, having a touch of pity for the assassin.",

Lo and behold two princes actually survive the whole ordeal and they grow up and learn weird @$$ kung fu and seek revenge against some guy with some golden finger weapon or some crap and blah blah blah and so forth. This is one of three movies directed by Shaw Brothers veteran Tang Chia and yes I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the producers fed this guy crack before making these movies. I like this one because of the insane kung fu action and the insane amount of special-effects this movie has to offer which I think is a lot better than those dumb@$$ Marvel movies. &quot;Nyuh! CGI, special effects.&quot; So gay. The story was pretty good too and easy to follow but still follows the same formulaic pattern like all other kung fu movies do which is about learning kung fu and seeking revenge. But who cares. Highly recommended kung fu movie with a lot of crackhead crap in it. Enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "An underrated gem from the cannon of Anthony Mann. Two agents - one American, one Mexican - cooperate on an investigation into illegal immigrant farm labour. The bad guys are the people smugglers, and boy are they bad - evil, ruthless and sadistic. Contains scenes of extreme violence which Hollywood tolerated in certain westerns and noirs of the late 40&apos;s post-war era, and this is kind of a western noir crime movie with lots of vegetables. Its a movie that could give you nightmares, especially if you approach it unaware due to its age, that its actually quite disturbingly brutal and relentless.\n\nEasily ranks as Ricardo Montoblan&apos;s finest performance, and only makes one baffled as to how he became such a shameless ham later in life with the likes of Fantasy Island. George Murphy, who plays the American agent, had a fascinating career. Dropping out of Yale to become a coal stoker, he switched to a tap dancing hoofer in 30&apos;s pictures, then a solid supporting actor in war pictures. Following the lead of his pal Ronnie Reagan he entered Republican politics, rising to become a member of the US Senate for California.\n\nJohn Alton lensed this picture, and his monochrome work is a remarkably beautiful achievement. Only a year after this movie Alton would photograph An American In Paris - easily one the best Technicolor movies ever shot.",

It&apos;s Wayne at his likable peak and Hayes&apos;s Gabby is about three-quarters complete. Some great stunts, as expected from a cast that includes maestro Yakima Canutt, along with a leading lady who really can ride (one bad trip-wire stunt, my only complaint). Watch for the unexpected and humorous twist when Wayne takes a short-cut to nail Dwire. Sometimes these programmers can surprise you. I guess kids don&apos;t play cowboy anymore. Computers have taken away imaginary play. Too bad. Now, if I were just x years younger, I&apos;d strap on my cap pistol, get my stick horse and join up with the posse. But first I got to get me one of those really big, big hats."

If you ever find this movie in a store like Wal-Mart, you&apos;ll find it in a bin full of crappy discount movies on VHS. Bronson Pinchot does a good job with what he has to work with anyhow. Some of the child actors are okay, in fact, a couple have done more acting in Nickelodeon shows. \n\nAs I stated above, the quality is bad, though some of the acting is decent, and however they trained the sea lion is pretty impressive though. I think this movie does a good job at defining a message. That message is stay away from the discount bin and watch something much better.",

      "reviewBody": "Full review here: http://thewildbore.blogspot.com/2010/12/rare-exports-  Christmas-tale.html  Finland isn&apos;t known for it&apos;s film exports, so here truly is a &apos;Rare  Export&apos; but should we return it? It&apos;s not exactly in the spirit of  Christmas is it?  This film is rather a prequel to two short films that the director made  in 2003 and 2005 (both I will stick at the end of this article) where  Santa isn&apos;t the merry old fat man we&apos;ve come to know and love but is  rather a beast of the wild that is tamed and exported around the world.  But deciding that some short films weren&apos;t enough, Jalmari Helander  decides to make a feature film about his &apos;hunters&apos; before the events of  Rare Exports Inc. &amp; Rare Exports: Official Safety Instructions. I have  to put this film into context because when viewing the film, not  knowing much about it, it seemed very strange afterwards but now it  kind of makes sense. However, it might be worth watching without seeing  the videos included here, but it&apos;s your choice.  Either way, the story is about how some corporate diggers are  excavating something from a mountain near a remote village in the snowy  outdoors. But it is a young boy who works out what is buried beneath  and is taking every precaution just in case, whether it&apos;s taping  cardboard to your bum or carrying around a shotgun, he&apos;s not taking any  chances. I read somewhere that this harks back to the kiddie films of  the Eighties like The Goonies where the kids were always right and the  adults were idiots, but this has much more of a horror element to it.  In fact, it is very funny in different places for different reasons but  always keeps a dark, sinister edge whether it&apos;s the weird wooden dolls,  the crazy rich excavator or the creepy Santa they find, there&apos;s always  a tinge of horror at all times.  The film is very well directed and, like many have said (mainly because  of the snow) reminds people of The Thing, but all the set-up&apos;s are  there and around the whole thing is the myth of Santa Claus (or Claws  in this case). It makes for a very exciting, disturbing experience that  is set around a time where people are supposed to get together and for  someone who doesn&apos;t really enjoy Christmas, like myself, it makes a  welcome distraction to all the &apos;niceness&apos; of the Christmas season. The  acting is, for the most part, very impressive and the end sequences  with hundreds of naked old men running across the mountains is both  funny and breathtaking at the same time. The film finds a great balance  between horror, terror, humour and remembering that it shouldn&apos;t take  itself too seriously, the gag is that it&apos;s about Santa after all.  I always found something creepy about a fat, old man going into  children&apos;s houses at night and giving them presents, seeing if they&apos;ve  been &apos;naughty or nice&apos; and this plays on people&apos;s insecurities  especially at a time where paedophilia is all over the news these days.  It also has a rather serious, dramatic edge with an obviously painful  father/son relationship, a man who is frustrated with the world and a  &apos;coming-of-age&apos; element about sacrifice and becoming independent. It  could also be seen as a war of male generations, the son against the  father, and the father against his own father, which in this case is  represented by Father Christmas, it would make sense seeing as there is  no females in the whole film but rather a world of manly hunters where  soppy things like Christmas have no place.  Overall, the film is enjoyable and the last five minutes is rather  strange but makes sense once you see the short films. It might have a  few plot holes but has been well thought out, perfectly directed and  for something that could have so easily been one big joke, remains an  impressive piece of work that the director clearly cared about. I  recommend that you forget the usual Christmas ho-ho-Hell&apos;s and delve  into a dark place where being naughty or nice is a life or death  decision.",

      "reviewBody": "For a period there, in the late 70s, we came very close to having real life in films. More real than ever. Oh, we had blood and tears, and an occasional breast, but the state of affairs was little different than that Disney TeeVee world where no bathrooms had toilets and sex was something oddly remote from the eye, always around the corner.\n\nPartly, its that odd, odd American prudishness, that tut tut notion that invisible things are managed things. But partly there&apos;s the simple fact that no good case could be made for &quot;watching.&quot; So a simple balance is maintained. Since sex sells, we&apos;ll have wet lips and vamping and wild joining of invisible parts. But we won&apos;t have life the way it really is, with all sorts of skin, intimacies and gentle touches. And smells.\n\nInto this space you&apos;ll find various intrusions. I really thought &quot;9 Songs&quot; was immensely clever, justifiably cinematic. I also find from time to time clever ideas in ordinary porn. &quot;Private Teacher&quot; by an Orson Welles associate had some neat ideas sneaked in, as did &quot;La Foire aux sexes&quot; which was every bit a good new wave film.\n\nAnd then you&apos;ll have something like this, which perhaps by itself set back the whole notion of intimacy in film three decades.\n\nIts big, its loud, its stupid. Fortunately, this was before that insane silicone and shaved craze hit the girlie watcher&apos;s world. But its of the same ilk in a way. \n\nJust think: Peter O&apos;Toole, Hellen Mirren, John Geilgud for chrissakes! Not bad set design, in that Italian monstrosity tradition of Zefferelli. A script by Gore Vidal  who knows nothing about how to flesh out a film (ouch, sorry), but whose larger arcs are solid. And Tinto Brass is not a bad filmmaker in the small, meaning he knows how to make a good image if not craft things as a project.\n\nIt could have worked, because by the late seventies, audiences had plenty of examples of performances that referenced and encapsulated other performances, so we could have what this could have been: a (film) performance of a (porn) performance of a (historical, voyeuristic-in-its-time) performance. And the projection of genital reality across those layers could have been intelligent as well as whatever else you may want.\n\nFor decades after Kinsey botched things with flawed science, Playboy was the vanguard of the sexual revolution. I&apos;m not making this up; there really was a &quot;Playboy philosophy&quot; which boiled down to: &quot;sex is natural and pleasant and if it doesn&apos;t hurt anyone, why not?&quot; With hippies as a sort of mascot, this seemed intelligent, especially since the girlie pictures were surrounded with some of the best writing in print. Those centerfolds mattered.\n\nThen along came a sort of second generation magazine which exploited the fact that Palyboy&apos;s girls had no body hair or genitals and were too linked to a set of obsolete fantasies. Penthouse girls had hair and fluids and were aggressive. Fewer coy blonds; more adventure. It was an equally vapid set of fantasies which as these things go went obsolete as quickly. But in the period of 76-80, that magazine was in the forefront of vaginal honesty in life. A forefront, such as society would allow.\n\nAnd there was the Playboy tradition of wrapping things in intellectual goo. Which meant that this film could have been something that mattered, that changed things. It could have cast itself in the same useless space as the Romans it portrayed. But it made a strange bargain: the story has these acts as perverted, distorted life. Where ordinary films went way out of their way to not show certain things in sex, this went as far the other way to show them. Its a strange world where sexual positions and acts are arranged precisely so that you CAN see.\n\nSo I think like all great turning points in film, this film is important. Its not good, its ghastly. But its important because its mistakes hurt us in places that matter and missed an opportunity to make film better, richer.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

What is also negative is the quality of the effects and the film which is quite poor and seems to have been made long before its actual release date.",

One of the books tells of how, shortly after her marriage, the Count&apos;s mother was carried away by a wild bear. After she was rescued by a hunter, she found out that she was pregnant but became convinced that the baby wasn&apos;t completely human. Is the Count a Lokis, the half human spawn of the bear that attacked his mother?\n\nBeautiful cinematography and impressive camerawork make Lokis a feast for the eyes, but the film takes a long time to go nowhere and it doesn&apos;t always make sense, with quite a few seemingly pointless scenes. As a horror, it is severely lacking in chills and scares, and the ending is frustratingly abrupt and ambiguous: is the Count really a were-bear or is he just barking mad like his mother?\n\n3/10 -- Too slow and strange with not enough horror for my liking.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Geek&quot; is a prime example of the oddities which cropped up during the early 70&apos;s transition from sexploitation to hardcore. Lacking the prolonged exposition and, usually comedic, subplots of traditional sexploitation films, The Geek&apos;s bare-bones story arc doesn&apos;t really fit into the sexploitation genre. Conversely, the film doesn&apos;t remotely fulfill the, then emerging, conventions of hardcore; relying on a few ham-handed closeups for graphic content. One might say they didn&apos;t manage to hit the goal of either genre, failing to sell the sizzle or the steak with this effort.\n\nDespite The Geek&apos;s &quot;neither fish nor fowl&quot; status, the film does pull off a degree of entertainment, all be it of the &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; variety. Odd dialog, poor acting, and micro budget production values abound. We experience the inept, go-go dancer turned actor, talent of early 70&apos;s starlets Lynn Holmes and Nora Wieternik; plus, one of the earliest appearances by golden era adult film stalwart Ric Lutze (although he keeps his pants on in this film). However, the film&apos;s namesake monster is what truly stands out here; a poorly costumed doofus, that molests and brawls its&apos; way through the film with an Ed Wood level of gratifying awfulness.\n\nUltimately, &quot;The Geek&quot; is a mildly entertaining bit of bizarre schlock and snapshot of an awkward period in adult cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "As a more than passing fan of the Zorro movies that span the decades, I had been waiting since 1998 for a sequel to Martin Campbell&apos;s &apos;Mask of Zorro.&apos; That movie took much (though not everything) of the best of the various Zorro films, serials, and series and then stole from other sources (such as Dumas &apos;Monte Cristo&apos;, etc) to concoct a sexy, swashbuckling action adventure that had great pacing and strengths, with high production values and actors. Mr. Campbell and those high standards at last return to the story begun, and we now follow our heroes and their son as California fights to join a struggling Union. Zorro&apos;s character is not quite so impulsive and cool as he once was, but simply comfortable and ultra-capable, while his wife Elena complains that the man behind the mask knows not who their son is growing up to be. None of these character &apos;upgrades&apos; felt wrong to me; it was natural extensions of them from the first film, despite how adventurous Elena claims to still be (and for the most part isn&apos;t), but it does make the first act of this movie a bit tiresome after the initial (awesome) action sequence. This time, though, as the story and its many plot-points begin to move, the writers borrow heavily from Hitchcock to keep things interesting. It doesn&apos;t always work, as there&apos;s a lot going on but never QUITE coming perfectly, cohesively together, but ultimately it makes sense and spins a good yarn for the fighting to take over. Meanwhile the stunt coordinators take what has already been done in the best Zorro flicks and then go wild with it, giving us stunts and action of old-school-cool caliber, such as stage-coaches, leaps and horses jumping on to explosive-laden locomotives. Unfortunately there is not quite enough action, and while I do like the over-all story - with its subtle bits of murk and dirty grays underneath the battle of white and black hats - it doesn&apos;t actually pace perfectly, giving us bickering Vega family exploits and Zorro failures for a rather large portion of the picture. The sword fights are fewer and more far-between than I would have liked, sometimes degrading to fisticuffs instead of proper dicing, but then the explosions almost make up for it all. The humor is a bit silly, provided mostly by the horse(!!) and the sometimes-annoying kid, but the audience ate it up. The villains are good, if never entirely fleshed out, and the themes are handled well. It&apos;s the lag caused by the idea (which I never understood) that &apos;once a couple gets together they&apos;re not interesting anymore&apos; that slows things. Regardless of my small issues, the movie DOES deliver as a Zorro film, (with a good ending, for certain) and while it doesn&apos;t completely live up to its predecessor, it is a worthy sequel - just not entirely the direction I would have gone.",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.\n\nUnlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.\n\nGodzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.\n\nOverall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.\n\nWhat I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla&apos;s at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla&apos;s in two different countries.\n\nSince this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.",

      "name": "High-quality sci-fi; production values no longer feasible for new videos",
      "reviewBody": "Despite some obvious flaws, I greatly enjoyed Brad Armstrong&apos;s &quot;2040&quot;, an ambitious sci-fi project that literally looks like a million bucks. Today&apos;s dwindling market for quality porn means we won&apos;t be seeing videos on this scale again.\n\nMy biggest criticism stems from an overabundance of in-jokes, out of place in an otherwise serious-mood film. In the first scene Barrett Blade (oddly left out of the opening credits) as a second-generation porn director name drops &quot;David Lords&quot; as his dad, an allusion I found irritating -cronyism when a mention of a late giant like Damiano or Spinelli would have sufficed. Similarly, hero Randy Spears takes as an alias in the final reels the name of the real-life head of film&apos;s distributor Wicked Pictures. That stuff belongs in a backyard horror video shot in New Jersey.\n\nSelf-reflexive premise is a future where a pandemic killed off much of Earth&apos;s population and sex is now relegated to beating off. Hence Armstrong&apos;s unconscious wish that Adult Entertainment would graduate to a lofty place in society, needed as a stimulant for a world of wankkers (purposely misspelled: IMDb made that word illegal).\n\nAgain under the heading of wish fulfillment, Spears is one of a dying breed of veteran porn actors in the future who are seemingly the only humpers left in the world. As if to prove this point, he has two impressive sex scenes in succession to kick off the movie, resulting in two quality cum shots.\n\nBoth are with androids, something of a Wicked product placement for its line of sex dolls, but also the subject of the show. Though finished film runs nearly 3 hours, its storyline would do for a simple &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, summed up in the battle of our villain Caldwell (played by Brad himself in the tradition of Erich von Stroheim&apos;s &quot;Man you love to hate&quot; casting) vs. Morris (should have been spelled Maurice, but perhaps that&apos;s too erudite out of Merchant-Ivory land for me to expect from even talented pornographers) the inventor of a new breed of android lady, well-played by that talented Brit in Chatsworth land, Marcus London.\n\nNew model robot is played by star Alektra Blue, who makes the entire movie work. She is fabulous in her sex scenes (starts off rather than build up to anal sex), has the best body in the business and manages to pull off a very tricky feat of convincing you she&apos;s a machine yet making you root for her as a sympathetic being. Brad&apos;s script has a hip allusion to &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and Blue is more convincing than the players of Cylons in that classic series.\n\nArmstrong&apos;s biggest boner (no pun this time) is to adhere to company policy at the time demanding that fiction films and videos promote safe sex with condoms, when in fact that crusade should have been relegated to PSAs. So we have the ridiculous spectacle of porn actors like Spears&apos; character &quot;Ryan Spears&quot; humping androids with a condom on, and routine robots played by the likes of Tommy Gunn and Mick Blue humping Alektra or a human like star Jessica Drake also with condoms on. Since Brad&apos;s script makes a big deal (stated at least twice) that the new improved androids have self cleaning technology built in that keeps them ship-shape without even needing to towel off, this nonsense of using condoms spoils the otherwise carefully built up credibility of the show&apos;s sci-fi content and trappings.\n\nThose trappings include excellent, convincing lab sets for the fabrication and display of the androids, some nice scale exterior scenes including a helicopter landing on a skyscraper heliport, quality costuming and especially a lengthy, all-star cast which alone must have cost big above the line bucks. Unlike a mammoth production like &quot;Pirates&quot; there is not the overkill of CGI and endless visual EFX, but they aren&apos;t needed for this more practical story.\n\nQuality sex is delivered by Blue, Drake, Kaylani Lei, Kirsten Price,Mikayla, Janet Mason and others. One quibble is leaving out some of the best sex scenes, in particular a brief (4-minute) masturbation display by Alektra in a mirrored palace of a bathroom that is the best sex in the entire production (DVD has 37 minutes of missing footage devoted to this plus some orgy material of little interest unless one has an orgy fetish).\n\nBeyond the impressive physical content, I found Brad&apos;s resolution of his story both moving and quality storytelling, again due to Alektra&apos;s collaboration."

Whether today or in the early 70s, each and every viewer simply wants to stare at slim and perky naked teen bodies and drool over their very first sexual escapades (usually with much older, uglier and fatter men). &quot;Schoolgirl Reports&quot; was unimaginably popular in Europe when it came out. So popular that it got programmed in big city theaters and spawned 12 sequels. Twelve!?! I guess the huge popularity can only be explained with a cliché. Different times... In 1970, free pornography wasn&apos;t all over the Internet - heck, there wasn&apos;t even &quot;The Internet&quot; - and the only hope for people to check out boobs, and maybe a little of bush, were films like these.",

      "reviewBody": "Newlyweds Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) are honeymooning in Hawaii when they decide to hike a popular trail through the lush Hawaiian wilderness. Halfway into their hike, the two learn about the slaying of another newlywed couple on one of the neighboring islands. The killers? A man and woman. Soon after, they encounter another couple on the trail, Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and his girlfriend, Gina (Kiele Sanchez). The four continue on the trail as a group, but it isn&apos;t long before Cliff and Cydney begin to suspect their new acquaintances of being the killers. There&apos;s also the shady hitchhikers, Kale (Chris Hemsworth) and Cleo (Marley Shelton, looking particularly nice with braided hair), who seem to be following them.\n\nWhile I was able to correctly guess the identity of the killer&apos;s just from watching the trailer, I still had a great time with this. The performances are really strong. I&apos;ve heard others say that Zahn and Jovovich aren&apos;t a believable pairing. I&apos;ve seen several instances of stunning women with less attractive guys, so that&apos;s nonsense. Aside from that, they&apos;re terrific together. This is a dialogue-heavy film with several amusing character moments thrown in, all of which the actors nail. Olyphant is the standout as Nick, a former marine with a bit of a screw loose. The humor actually works, the quirkiness adding to the picture. I also thought that the B&amp;W exposition scene was well-done, better than most of it&apos;s ilk. These types of scenes are generally frowned upon, but here it winds up being a highlight.\n\nThe Puerto Rican locations (subbing for Hawaii) are quite lovely, though the dangers of the trail aren&apos;t played up as much as I&apos;d expected. It isn&apos;t an element that&apos;s necessarily needed, however, as I found the film to be plenty suspenseful as is. The killers were obvious to me, yes, but the I was more caught up in the situations than the reveal. For instance, the situation of the reveal made for a terrific moment. It&apos;s all in how it&apos;s done. While I could have done without the annoying screenwriter in-jokes, they don&apos;t ruin the suspense either.\n\nI&apos;d say that director David Twohy has more hits than misses, and this clever slice of pulpy entertainment continues that trend."

He threatens Kelly and her sister Toby (Stefanie Powers) to force her to heist $100,000 from her bank; otherwise he will kill her. Kelly does not see his face but notes he is asthmatic. Kelly succeeds to lure the criminal and contacts the FBI agent John &apos;Rip&apos; Ripley (Glenn Ford) that advises Kelly how to behave and assigns a group of agents to keep Kelly and Toby under surveillance. But when Toby is abducted by the stranger, Kelly tries to stay calm to help the FBI to catch the criminal.\n\n&quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; is an above average thriller from the early 60&apos;s in a noir style directed by Blake Edwards and with Glenn Ford, Lee Remick (whom we all miss so dearly) and Stefanie Powers on the lead roles. The story has flaws but the storyline is excellent and Ross Martin performs a great villain. When Lee Remick&apos;s character Kelly is attacked for the first time, her eyes are impressive even in a black- and-white film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Escravas do Medo&quot; (&quot;Slaves of the Fear&quot;)",

(A very nice play) A good movie , about drug dillers and a lot of military action against them, solo action , four/five man against a hole drug dillers. A little non-realistic, but over and all a nice , action pack film! See it if you like military movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Wonderfully shot Ford film with a lively look at the spirit of Navy , including glorification of military life , familiar drama , love and sentimental nostalgia with interesting character studio of a varied assortment of individuals . It&apos;s a first-rate war melodrama , including comedy , and masterfully directed by the great John Ford . It&apos;s based on the life of one of America&apos;s greatest air heroes , Frank ¨Spig¨Wead , an Air hero who wrote plays about the war . He starred some rousing exploits in the ¨Schneider Cup Air Races¨. But he suffers a home accident and is interned in ¨San Diego National Hospital¨, and despite being crippled and wheel-bound he subsequently made a substantial contribution to America&apos;s war effort in the Pacific during WWII. He was a famous aviation pioneer become Hollywood screenwriter and one of them was ¨They were expendable (1945) ¨ directed by the same Ford and also with Wayne in the main role . This is a great and stolid drama, a John Ford&apos;s lusty realization and marvelously constructed. \n\nThis classic picture ranks as one of the best of John Ford&apos;s work. It contains Ford&apos;s usual themes as familiar feeling , a little bit enjoyable humor, friendship and and sense of comradeship among people . Multiple highlights as the fights between Air and Army soldiers and of course the sensible final farewell on the carrier . Interesting screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface is written by Frank Fenton, John Ford&apos;s habitual, and based on the life and writings of Commander Frank W. &apos;Spig&apos; Wead . \n\nThis excellent film featuring a magnificent performance by whole casting . Awesome John Wayne in a larger-than-life character . Enticing and intimate Maureen O&apos;Hara in a sensible role with sensational acting . Excellent co-starring cast as War Bond as John Ford-alter ego, including pipe-smoking and hat . In the film appears , as usual , Ford&apos;s favourite actors as Ken Curtis , Mae Marsh , Kenneth Tobey, Willis Bouchey, Jack Pennick , some of them are uncredited . Good cinematography by Paul Voguel and jingoist musical score by Jeff Alexander. Rating : Better than average . Worthwhile watching .",

Guess they wanted to make a historic/Traditional movie.\n\nNevertheless, The movie is good. Those who were disappointed after watching an old Jackie in &quot;the karate kid&quot; will be really happy to see him in this movie, with a great new load of stuff.\n\nWaiting for the next action packed Jackie&apos;s movie in English.\n\nHope he pairs up to do another Rush Hour 4 or some cool movies where he doesn&apos;t drink much",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot; begins with some very cool opening credits. The font and backgrounds are quite striking and work well with the rest of the film. As for the rest of the movie, it&apos;s an odd little story about a strange woman who rubs other women the wrong way. While I thought this aspect of the story was overdone, the overall film is worth your time.\n\nThe story begins with a bunch of sexless old biddies approaching the local priest. They think that his housekeeper, Emily, is evil. Why exactly they think that is a bit vague--but apparently they hate her because men are inexplicably attracted to her (she&apos;s not THAT pretty by the way). Regardless, the priest is a wimpy guy who just wants things to be quiet, so he sends her to work for some far off folks. However, once in the new locale, once again the local women inexplicably grow to hate her. The problem is, you learn later that they have darned good reason--though they have no idea how bad she really is! \n\nThis is a good film but I think some of it was overdone. The way women almost automatically hate Emily seems ridiculous and making all this more subtle would have worked much better. Still, it is an enjoyable little film and worth seeing despite a few limitations.",

      "reviewBody": "Like most 1980s action/suspense movies, &quot;Defense Play&quot; is standard issue in nature:  the bad guys are Russians, the good guys are average Americans (living in a California style backdrop) who love racing their cars and playing rock &amp; roll.  In good 80s fashion, the plot revolves around a secret weapon which cannot fall into enemy hands.\n\nIn the Reagan-esque &quot;Defense Play&quot; storyline, we see the United States Air Force attempting to launch a top secret satellite into orbit (on a Saturn V rocket of all things).  To foil the US satellite launch, the KGB plans to steal a top-secret, remotely piloted stealth helicopter (codenamed &apos;DART&apos;) being produced at a local university.  Because DART is so small, it cannot be easily detected, and therefore would be optimal for use in attacking the well defended USAF Saturn V at Vandenburg AFB.\n\nThe hero and heroine of &quot;Defense Play&quot; are your classic all-American teenagers who get &apos;tangled&apos; in the nefarious plot and decide to take down the bad guys.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Defense Play&quot; is a good, half-decent low budget film which might appeal particularly to the teens, and follows in the fashion and style of such 80s films as Iron Eagle, My Science Project, Real Genius, The Rescue, and many others.  It serves as a good flashback to the days when low budget producers didn&apos;t have an F-117 (and tons of F-117 stock footage) to make as the centerpiece of all the action (the official &apos;blow up plane&apos; of the 80s was desert camoflauged F-16s).\n\n&quot;Defense Play&quot; is an obscure film, but well worth watching if you just want to kick back and have a few laughs."

      "reviewBody": "No, the story resolution itself isn&apos;t stupid. I&apos;m talking about the ridiculous over-the-top theatrics that turn this otherwise intelligent story into a carnival, heavy on the cotton candy. All subtlety is lost, and we&apos;re given a razmatazz final scene that beats the point home harder than getting your head slammed into a ceramic sink so hard that it breaks (the sink). Twice. By the way, that&apos;s what happens to a character, and the character still manages to walk away like nothing happened.\n\nThat little sink example is the perfect illustration of how this movie, which initially began so well I spent the first hour whispering to myself, &quot;how did I never hear of this awesome movie before?&quot; falls apart in the last 30 minutes and becomes almost a parody of every cheesy action flick you&apos;ve ever forgotten. &quot;Red Lights&quot; begins with one of the most suspenseful &apos;gotcha&apos; scenes in movie history--simply because it&apos;s the *opposite* of every thriller cliché you&apos;d never expect it. Immediately the film establishes itself as the true skeptic&apos;s thriller: a movie that&apos;ll scare the crap out of people who don&apos;t scare easily because they don&apos;t fall for ghosts and demons and spooky gags. This film sucks us into the intrigue NOT on the promise of supernatural gimmicks but on the opposite: a cryptic, real-world secret that explains all the fake supernatural stuff.\n\nFinally, I thought! A movie that can carry the suspense with pure, scientific reality. Almost like Mythbusters but with a dead person or two. Like a good political thriller (&quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot;), the film is tense and riveting even though there aren&apos;t any shootouts or car chases or space robots. But, oh dear lord, all of that gets flushed in a supremely preposterous climax that left me wondering if the real director died during filming and was replaced by JJ Abrams.\n\nNobody is more disappointed than I am, because I really thought this would become one of my top 10 thrillers. Great acting, excellent mood cinematography and a wonderfully original story had the deck stacked in its favor. I&apos;m still in shock that it turned so sour, most probably for the sake of dazzling the less attentive audience members who demand gratuitous fight scenes and pyrotechnics (literal pyrotechnics lol) to give us a wow bang finish."

      "name": "The best film about graffiti ever",
      "reviewBody": "It is a shame so few people have seen the 1982 PBS documentary &quot;Style Wars&quot;. It is not listed in either Lenny Maltin&apos;s or Videohound&apos;s giant books. This story of NYC graffiti writers fighting transit cops, their parents, and each other is still the definitive word on graffiti and early hip hop culture in the days before it became commercialized. This was probably the 1st film anywhere to examine break dancing and hip hop in any depth well before either became mainstream. For that reason alone it is an important part of hip hop history, to see what it was all about before corruption by cash and fame.\n\nSome standout personalities in this film include one armed Case, former NYC mayor Ed Koch, graffiti &quot;villan&quot; Cap, and Skeme and his mom. On the 2nd DVD many of the still living graffiti writers are interviewed in 2001, and although Skeme is now a major in the US army, his (now) little old lady mom is still afraid someone&apos;s kid is going to get hurt in the subway tunnel. Some of the kids from Style Wars are dead like Shy and Dondi (both have tributes),and some went to prison like Min. Some are successful 40 and even 50 somethings today. One or two even go paint the occasional subway car still.\n\nThe 1st DVD contains outtakes from Style Wars, some of which could have been removed originally to make the filmmakers look better. The transit authority cop says he thinks the film will encourage others to commit vandalism. It is also apparent when watching this DVD that Cap was made out to seem worse than he was thru creative editing. The 2nd DVD contains a great short film from 1976 (I think) called Classic hits by Tracy 168 (from Wild Style).\n\nOverall this film tries to look at graffiti from the perspectives of the writers themselves, citizens of New York, and the establishment. Even the artists saw the end of the golden age coming with barbed wire fences and eventually even dogs being employed to keep them out of the train yards. It&apos;s just unfortunate that such an original art form was so unrecognized by mainstream society. Maybe it had to be that way anyway, when the art community did notice and galleries did start showing the art on canvas, it tended to become fossilized. The scene in the gallery is funny because the artists who are planning to cash in on graffiti try to convince themselves that &quot;getting up&quot; can be be done on canvas as well as trains. A young Swedish woman at the art gallery correctly observes its not the same on canvas, that is an art form that belonged on the trains, not on a gallery wall.\n\nThe definitive book to go along with Style wars is &quot;Subway Art&quot; by Henry Chalfant who also produced style Wars. He and Martha Cooper spent a huge amount of time photographing NYC subways, and their hard work is well documented on the 2nd DVD which contains 32 artist galleries and a 30 minute loop of train photos. \n\nIf all you have ever seen about graffiti is &quot;Wild Style&quot; or &quot;Beat Street&quot;, pick up Style Wars. If you can find it. Stylewars.com",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was good and though it has not deviated from the masala style, Vijay has acted well enough to make it entertaining. The comedy in the first half, especially the one between Vijay and Anushka is good. If Vivek or Vadivelu had been inserted, it would have been more entertaining. Salim Ghouse has acted well enough to be a typical Villain in a Vijay film. But the few drawbacks are there which could have been taken care of. The villain doesn&apos;t over react or get tensed when he is facing even his son&apos;s death! Also, Anushka&apos;s acting is typical Telugu style which spoils the movie. The whole movie was made like a Telugu one, which should have been changed.",

Her parents are led to believe that their daughter drowned with the convict who kidnapped her and are devastated. However, the girl was really sent to live in another home as Peppina, their daughter.\n\nYears later, Peppina refuses to marry a disgusting old man that has paid for her hand in marriage, so she dresses as a boy and escapes.\n\nFor a 1916 film, this one has a surprisingly good plot filled with twists and turns. The photography is more advanced than one might expect; the film is not entirely shot far away from the actors.\n\nMary Pickford is good in her role, but her part is not very typical. Instead of being able to show off her vibrant personality, Pickford is restrained in the film, but effectively so.\n\nJack Pickford, Mary&apos;s brother, has a small part as her &quot;brother&quot; in the film, one of the few times the two were in a film together. In their scenes together, they seem genuinely close, but his character fades away near the end.\n\nMost of the actors use elaborate stage gestures throughout the film, but this is appropriate since the characters are supposed to be Italian.\n\nOverall, this is an engaging film.",

      "reviewBody": "Acting: THE GOOD. Richard Reeves and Virginia Grey. Although they both started the movie completely intoxicated, they suddenly become sober at the sight of a dead body. But I found them to be the only two characters with any hint of personality in this movie. THE BAD: Everybody else. Kathleen Crowly runs through the vacant city with a smile on her face, isn&apos;t she supposed to be frightened? Richard Denning is just the opposite. His face is so straight throughout the whole movie, I was beginning to believe HE was a robot. And finally, Robert Roark...ugh!! What is that?? A Humphry Bogart impersonation?\n\nSPECIAL EFFECTS: THE GOOD: You&apos;ll only have to look at the robots a few times,the rest is left to our imaginations. THE BAD: Is that robot bow-legged? Well, I have seen worse in other B-movies.\n\nCLASSIC LINES: FRANK: &quot;Take it easy, I&apos;m not going to hurt you!&quot; Just before slapping Nora in the face. And, FRANK: &quot;It&apos;s(Venus)covered by a heavy layer of clouds,that means plenty of water, oxygen, and hydrogen in it&apos;s atmosphere.&quot; VICKI: &quot;Say, where did you learn all this?&quot; FRANK: &quot;College.&quot; Overall, this is your average 50&apos;s sci-fi with more focus on character studies than on the cheap looking robot. Which saves it from the Ed Wood level of movie making.",

It handles much more sensitive material than the first movie and tackles some truly dark and heavy subject material, but manages to keep it from becoming a drama by dropping in comedic material in a manner that is never jarring, out of place, or desperate. Lord Shen made for one of the most delightful villains of recent movie history. His push against the future contrasting with Po&apos;s struggle with the past was wonderful to watch. Po&apos;s talks with his father brought a tear to my eye in more than one moment in the film. This company and production team have firmly established themselves as formidable storytellers and I&apos;m eager to see what&apos;s next.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;New Police Story&apos; shows how top production values, a well-known cast, a fine action director and a great director of photography can turn a pretty moronic screenplay into an entertaining action movie. One way to see the fine job done here is to compare Nicholas Tse&apos;s performance here in a pivotal role to the part he played in &apos;Goddess of Mercy,&apos; an HK movie involving police made in mainland China. In that movie Tse played his role as a bad guy as if he were overdue for a dialysis treatment, unsmiling and shabby looking. In &apos;New Police Story&apos; he is full of life, playing a key role that initiates much of the action. Charlene Choi, in a supporting role as an HK police woman, also helps keep the action moving (without overdoing the perkiness). If Jackie Chan wants to play serious his role as an inspector whose life has gone on the skids, he has the sense not to overdo it after an early scene where he is so drunk he throws up in an alley. As a star vehicle for Jackie Chan, &apos;New Police Story&apos; does the job. Next time, though, Jackie should make the villains more believable."

However, once Meg Tilly  finds her way into the deserted mosoleum, its a lot of fun, and a little gory (which is fun in itself, right?)"

The hallucination scenes are very complex and confusing and should have been simplified to bring the story forward. (why do the directors get so carried away by digital effects? they of all, should know that it is the story and the &quot;flow&quot; of the movie that is important, not the amount of digital effects you can put in it!) However, this movie is definitely worth watching, but don&apos;t expect a conventional action western!",

      "reviewBody": "The concept of joss should be familiar to many followers of Hong Kong&apos;s antics. Used profusely in James Clavell novels (Tai Pan, Noble House et al), joss relates notions of life&apos;s fickle randomness, as events remain at the mercy of capricious gods. Whatever those will, happens. Joss. Looking for a reason may be nothing more than a solid waste of time.\n\nAlthough no longer in vogue as a word, joss still holds sway over things HK. To wit, this spat of top-shelf action flicks that came out of nowhere following months and perhaps years of utter dreariness.\n\nAs if Dragon Squad wasn&apos;t good enough a couple weeks back, here comes SPL, or Saat Po Lang, which literally (should, if this reviewer&apos;s language skills are any good) mean &quot;kill the bent wolf&quot;. That particular translation does make sense in light of the film&apos;s plot, as does the Film Board&apos;s decision to waltz with danger and place a category III rating on another movie not far behind Election on the release schedule. This dalliance has us totally in thrall, for HK&apos;s censors have historically proved themselves to be timid scaredy-cats with the utmost adverse reaction to anything remotely good. And while SPL may not be the next Natural Born Killers or Bad Lieutenant, it does earn its three I&apos;s with more aplomb than a few lesser projects, and contains more than enough gratuitous bloodshed to sate action pundits.\n\nJust like Dragon Squad, so doesn&apos;t SPL shy away from all the things that have traditionally made HK an excellent source of frenetic action nutrients. However, while DS put itself in a somewhat-comedic, hyper-realistic version of the city, SPL takes place firmly in a Gothamite rendition of HK, brooding and awash with menace. Wilson Yip (Bullets Over Summer, White Dragon) and his posse provide just the right quotients of each ingredient, resulting in an atmosphere perfectly adjusted to its purpose. You can&apos;t avoid liking the HK seen here, with its Streets of Fire/Young and Dangerous-like roaming gangs, dark, desolate cityscapes and hapless police force.\n\nWhat the cops are so prostate before is Wong Po, master criminal and ruthless sadist cum family man, done by a delectable Sammo Hung. Sammo&apos;s always been good as a villain, and this Kingpin-esquire meanie&apos;s no exception. Wong Po combines the usual crazed bad guy with a loving husband, and of course possesses relentless martial arts skills. These are deployed against the movie&apos;s main protagonists, the good-but-shadowy police types everybody loves so much. They&apos;re headed by Chung (Simon Yam AGAIN), who&apos;s got it in for Wong Po after a family of witnesses under his protection got wasted on the criminal&apos;s bequest.\n\nBut Chung&apos;s naturally about to retire in order to care for his goddaughter (sole survivor of said family), so the stage is set for new captain Inspector Ma, another fighting machine in the form of ever-likable Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey, Hero, Seven Swords) to come in and join the fray. Others include abrasive, skeptic cop Ah Wah (Liu Kai Chi, pretty much in every HK movie over the last few years) and a nameless, lunatic killer employed by Wong Po (martial arts expert Wu Jing).\n\nSave for a few minor pseudo-surprises, SPL follows a normative mold as far as story goes, but succeeds mostly in terms of its superb pace and impressive mood-setting elements. The comic book characters fit their respective personalities, can take a whole lot of damage, and have this knack for seeming serious, like they&apos;re in a real crime story rather than fiction. Gunplay, hack &apos;n&apos; slash and fighting have all found a spot for themselves herein, and none overpowers the other, so that&apos;s all good, too.\n\nLikewise, Yip managed to add quizzical surrealism to the mix by telling us the movie takes place 1994-1997. Sure, the old colonial flag of HK is seen briefly, and cop badges read Royal Police, but beyond that, it&apos;s obviously the now, not ten years ago. Cars, clothes, and buildings are all contemporary. To some, this may be ridiculous. To others, it&apos;s a useful storytelling conceit, in synch with the story&apos;s overall fairy tale, fantasy mindset.\n\nAdditional assets in SPL&apos;s collection number generally strong supporting characters (Chung&apos;s crew and Wong Po&apos;s insane-clown head minion), a gorgeous soundtrack, and this perturbing ability to fuse components from action epics like Cobra and The Punisher with gangland hysteria a la Goodfellas or Scarface (just listen to the violins as they play in the background).\n\nPerhaps nostalgia and time won&apos;t be as kind to SPL as they were to the films that inspired it, but one can&apos;t hide from acknowledging we have before us another substantial action entry in a year that, for ten months out of twelve, was nigh on arid in the adrenaline department, and that&apos;s not even mentioning the years preceding.\n\nArchetypal tormented cops, obsessive villains, a city teeming with unrestrained violence and props so destructible they must have cost more than hiring Simon Yam and Sammo, who have been so prolific recently we have to wonder when they get any time off.\n\nIn short, and acronyms aside, go watch it.\n\nRating: * * * *",

      "reviewBody": "On the surface, &apos;Marty&apos; appears to be a simple love story about a butcher and a school-teacher, but there are many more layers to this film, which manages to be simultaneously funny &amp; deeply moving without ever getting corny.\n\nThere&apos;s so much about this film that stands the test of time half a century later. It&apos;s no wonder it won so many awards that year (including 4 Oscars.) In her autobiography, Betsy Blair mentions that &apos;Marty&apos; was the high point of her career; it made her a movie star overnight and she was never again in anything as important (though I thought her performance in &apos;A Delicate Balance&apos; with Katherine Hepburn years later was even better.) She won the BAFTA for her role here, as did Ernest Borgnine, who deservedly swept every award that year for his role as Marty, including the Oscar and the Golden Globe. Borgnine is flawless in his performance &amp; lovable from the very first scene. Esther Monciotti as his mother also delivers a standout performance. Some of the funniest and most memorable lines in the film belong to her and her on-screen sister. The rest of the supporting cast are also great to watch. The frank dialogue and the humanity of the characters make this a film you want to watch more than once.",

      "description": "Sentimental, heart-warming piece of Academy Award winning cinema...\n\nA beloved classic of American cinema, Delbert Mann&apos;s MARTY was the first ever recipient of the Palme d&apos;Or at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, one of only two films to ever win both organisations&apos; grand prizes (the second being Billy Wilder&apos;s THE LOST WEEKEND).\n\n&quot;I&apos;ve been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life,&quot; says Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine, THE VIKINGS, VIOLENT SATURDAY). Yet, despite all his efforts, this 34-year old Bronx butcher remains as shy and uncomfortable around women today as on the day he was born. So when he meets Clara (Betsy Blair, IL GRIDO), a lonely school teacher who&apos;s just as smitten with him as he is with her, Marty&apos;s on top of the world. But not everyone around him shares his joy. And when his friends and family continually find fault with Clara, even Marty begins to question his newfound love... until he discovers, in an extraordinary way, the strength and courage to follow his heart. \n\nAdapted from an earlier teleplay written by renowned screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky (Network), Eureka Classics is proud to present MARTY in a special Dual Format edition, that includes the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK. The Special Features include the aforementioned teleplay broadcast on NBC in 1953, also directed by Delbert Mann and starring Rod Steiger in the title role.",

Outrageously colorful and stylized, it&apos;s a tale of a girl trained as a sword-fighter who works as a cop, and a mysterious masked swordsman who may or may not be in league with a gang who is flooding the country with counterfeit money. The plot is confusing enough, but it really doesn&apos;t matter: it&apos;s just an excuse for some amazing set- pieces involving crowds of sword-fighters, fighters chasing through markets and dye factories, barroom brawls, and over the top humor. And swordplay as foreplay. Not likely to get a US release, but a lot of fun. Modern Korean cinema, in my opinion, is leading the world in terms of set and scenic design, and innovative cinematography. Catch this film to see what I mean.",

Wonderful cinematography, magical camera technique, and a highly unique style of story telling as the titillating plot unfolds with unending suspense and timing.

      "reviewBody": "I had to wait more than 10 years to finally see this one. Not one single copy seemed to be available over here in Europe. That was until 2007, when I finally got my hands on a Region 1 DVD copy.\n\nIf you like anthology movies, then you have no excuse for not seeing this one. One of the best anthology movies of the 90&apos;s (it&apos;s up there with &quot;Tales From The Dark Side: The Movie&quot; and &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, if you ask me). And probably the best horror movie from the hood with a nearly all Afro-American cast ever made (because I can&apos;t really say I&apos;ve ever seen a ghetto-horror flick that was actually any good). Three hood-rats, out to collect some &apos;shiiit&apos;, visit a freaky coroner who tells them 4 terrifying tales of the supernatural.\n\nThe first tale is about three corrupt white cops who had it coming... Wings Hauser is especially enjoyable in this one. He already evoked my interest at the time after having seen his enjoyable performance in &quot;Night Shadows&quot; (AKA &quot;Mutant&quot;). And by know I simply love the man. Second story is about a boy and his bruises, which are being caused by... a monster supposedly living in his house. Great and fascinating conclusion this one had. The third tale has some killer-puppet action going on in it of which Charles Band could easily be very jealous. Corbin&quot;The Dentist&quot;Bernsen stars in this segment that revolves around voodoo and slavery. The fourth and last segment gives a big nod to Kubrick&apos;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Enough said about that one. The wrap-around story wraps it all up nicely, and has a very satisfying conclusion. \n\n&quot;Tales From The Hood&quot; is actually more than &apos;just a horror movie&apos;. With Spike Lee being executive producer, you can rightfully expect that this movie will carry important themes &amp; topics like racism, politics, police brutality, guilt, child abuse, brothers killing brothers, etc. The message always comes across, but possible statements &amp; points of view never become too dominant. This film&apos;s primary goal is to entertain a horror audience. And it splendidly succeeds in that. The filmmakers also clearly know the rules of the horror-anthology-genre as well as the tricks of the trade, all to great success. Need I even say that the make-up and special effects are darn excellent too? The tales from this hood, are all winners.",

Shankar and his father believe that the plant should be built in Maharashtra and persuade people of the villages where the plant is to be built to accept the plans. But events turn ugly, when one day Avantika, Subash&apos;s daughter  in  law is killed when her car is detonated by a bomb.\n\nThe movie stars Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Supriya Pathak, Victor Bannerjee and Tanisha.\n\nNot as good as the original, Ram Gopal Verma, still has managed to put in some ghosts of Mario Puzo&apos;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; more so with reference to bombing of the vehicle and to some extent, he has put in some ghosts of &quot;Sarkar&quot; as well. What was a bit disappointing was that sound track, &quot;Govinda&quot; has not lived to the expectations as it did in the previous one and this is where, perhaps, the music director, Amar Mohile, could have done more to revive the original version.\n\nBe warned there is violence but never the less a good movie to watch with elder children and adult family members.",

While this isn&apos;t going to win any Oscars, for a small budget direct to DVD feature, it&apos;s really pretty good fun. The 3D shows off the beautiful scenery and the story, while somewhat predictable, has fun tie ins to Jack London&apos;s book, The Call of the Wild through Grandpa reading his granddaughter the story at night. It has a good message, and the acting is really quite good. There are some cheesy parts and some eye roller lines, but the kids thought it was wonderful, and my wife and I found ourselves pleasantly entertained. Christopher Lloyd plays it pretty straight laced in this one, but gives a good performance, and we were impressed with Ariel Gade&apos;s performance. It really gave the story credibility.\n\nOverall an enjoyable family movie for the kids with just enough weight to keep mom and dad entertained as well.",

Even her personal driver would be OK. Sounds strange? It&apos;s not over yet.\n\nThe driver is given his assignment without any background check. The general picks him up like a seashell on a shore and he doesn&apos;t mind him going after his beloved daughter. The driver is also threatened to regret his deeds if he doesn&apos;t take his approach seriously. \n\nAt this point you might stop watching this crap but you would miss the following plot gems: a record-breaking time for a child birth, the driver mating around on premises despite the warning, a cuban soldier abusing russian girls on cruise ship, the driver holding his car with bare hands while it&apos;s hanging over the abyss, a mighty KGB screwing up its operations by doing stupid (if not insane) things, a car chase ending with escape of unarmed and unskilled person from men in chemical protective suits, etc.\n\nAll of this is to remind you how USSR government was bad to its law abiding citizens. \n\nAs to pure cinema values this film definitely has one in Alyona Babenko. Her beauty is in 10 stars range so she balances everything else and I gave it 3 after calculating the average ))",

I cant understand how she got a role in a German low budget B-action movie with bad effects. Its fun to see how Heather tries to move her lips so it looks like german. Anyway this movie is above average german low budgets and its quiet good if you understand german, but the only reason you should try to get this really really hard to find movie is if you are a fan of Heather otherwise its not worth seeing. The only place you can find this movie is in Germany.\n\nHeather Thomas 4ever!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Smart Far Eastern horror uses chills, psychology and subtle intelligence to place itself a cut above many of its peers.\n\nJu-on 2 is obviously a sequel to Ju-on (The Grudge), a fairly reasonable if perhaps not brilliant chiller from the Orient, in which a murder had caused the house it occurred in to host a curse as a result of the slaying. \n\nFollowing on from this, Ju-on 2 uses the same trick as seen in the likes of Magnolia whereby a bunch of victims, related to one another in some way, suffer at the hands of said curse. \n\nIndeed, this is much like a compendium of tales, focusing on around 6 victims whose lives becomes inextricably linked as a result of circumstance, all of which harks back to the original house. \n\nHowever, rather than outlining the finer details of the plot, it seems fairer to explain *why* this is such a good effort from Asia compared to so many of its really rather derivative kin such as Phone, Eye etc.\n\nCertainly this also has more than a homage to Ring, and could be tenuous accused of slight plagiarism given many of the utterly blatant similarities, so what makes it a cut above the others?\n\nWell, one of the main strengths here is some fantastic psychological trickery. The direction itself is fantastically conducive to it, and without giving away the exact nature of the manipulation of the viewer going on here, it&apos;s fair to say that it does a pretty good job of conveying the same kind of &apos;wrongness&apos; that Ring exuded. There are plenty of moments here which create a genuine chill such is their effective defying of how we believe the laws of physics and biology work. When an event goes against all the worldly beliefs you have set in stone, it makes you take notice. Furthermore, given the distinctly psychological nature of much of Ju-on 2, it truly comes across as utterly twisted like some kind of awful nightmarish trip (Unlike Audition&apos;s frankly baffling last 3rd) but one which doesn&apos;t leave the viewer confused.\n\nThere are also a number of subtle tricks in evidence, many of which don&apos;t become apparent till later, all of which genuinely gathered an impressed reaction from me.\n\nI am not going to pretend this is a terrifying movie, because to me, while there were certainly moments which got the adrenaline going a little, it is not exactly all that scary if you&apos;re a fan of these movies. Basically, we&apos;ve seen it all before.\n\nNonetheless, as critical and harsh as that sounds, it still manages to entertain extremely well despite it, because it uses its own unique brand of originality to compliment the obvious nods to other movies.\n\nCertainly one of the best Eastern horrors I&apos;ve seen.",

It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own. The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case. It appears that the director or make-up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie. Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie. This was honestly an awful movie and I couldn&apos;t believe how badly it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like &quot;whats going on?&quot; The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen&apos;s joking around making a fake fight scene.\n\nIF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show&apos;s how awful it truly is. I wish i would have watched it before i rented it.",

Well, after this introduction you could think this movie might be really sad, telling you the story of many suffering people. But it isn&apos;t! It is full of grotesque. You just can&apos;t watch this movie without laughing a lot.\n\nPeople living in Dunaújváros (an industrial town expanded during the communism) already know how to behave themselves to avoid being arrested. Fearing of the terror they are used to not speaking about things one mustn&apos;t speak. They never miss taking part in the public feasts, where all of them seem (pretend) to be really really happy with all the benefits communism gives to them.\n\nBut there is an extraordinary man, Csocsó Bácsi. Somehow the rules seem not to apply on him. He is like a funny fool but he is simply not scared. He thinks different. And with his tricks  he makes the life of the ugly ÁVH-officer ( ÁVH ~ State Defense Agency) quite hard...\n\n If you haven&apos;t seen this movie yet, i recommend it to be seen. It is almost like Forrest Gump for US.",

      "reviewBody": "This forgotten 1968 sleeper &quot;Pretty Poison&quot; is an underrated classic. Directed by Noel Black (who hasn&apos;t really made a decent film since), this film is the story of a recently released Dennis Pitt (from a mental hospital), who&apos;s trying to begin a new life in the real world (while still stuck in his childhood fantasy world of his mind). Anthony Perkins plays Dennis Pitt, the nervously energized, accident prone, sapp that will be the victim to high school &quot;femme fatale&quot; Sue Ann Stepanek (brilliantly portrayed by Tuesday Weld). Dennis after being released, pretends to be a secret agent that&apos;s recruiting Sue Ann to assist in the sabotage of the factory he is currently working at. Sue Ann goes along with Dennis in playing out his fantasies, only to ensure that she adds more havok to his already goofy plans. What starts off as a childish prank (and most of his schemes are childish) turns into complete collapse of the factory structure and the death of one of the security gaurds, due mostly through Sue Ann&apos;s intervention. The search to find and question Dennis, leads to his hiding out with Sue Ann&apos;s help. Between dodging his old doctor (who&apos;s responsible for him since his release) Morton Azenauer (reliable actor John Randolf), and being manipulated by Sue Ann to kill her mother (a wicked Beverly Garland), Dennis has turned into a nervous twitching idiot. He really hasn&apos;t the bottle to kill anyone, and Sue Ann begins to use him as the patsy. What&apos;s interesting about this film is that the whole story of Dennis being set up as the sapp for a murder he didn&apos;t commit, can be connected with the time of the John F. Kennedy assasination and the country&apos;s suspicion to foul play. It&apos;s the losers like Dennis that the country won&apos;t believe, while honor role students like Sue Ann are looked at as nice girls. Sue Ann Stepanek is one of the few trully &quot;bad seeds&quot; of cinema. She has absolutely no morals or concience. She can commit murder, and resume living as if nothing has happened. But she&apos;s also terribly exciting. She&apos;s sexually active, she&apos;ll live out your childish fantasies and games, and she&apos;s very clever. But she&apos;s poison. Incidentally, the factory that Dennis works at dumps hazardous chemicals in the lake everyday. This innocent looking chemical (which has a pretty glow) is a toxic compound that is being dumped into the cities water supply. Not only is this just a metaphore symbolic to Sue Ann&apos;s character, but I can&apos;t help feeling that maybe Sue Ann&apos;s Mother was digesting some of these toxins while pregnant with Sue Ann. Because Sue Ann is trully a &quot;bad seed&quot; from birth. An intelligent sleeper, that never received it&apos;s fair dues. Highly recommended."

Cameron would probably like to forget this one, because it is sadly less perfect than Dante&apos;s original. In Piranha II: The Spawning you&apos;re no longer safe outside the water. This time they can fly. Now, with a premise like that you expect certain things. Evil, flying, man-eating fish just begs for comedy. But I assure you, this film is never played for laughs; and that&apos;s its downfall. Dante&apos;s Piranha had elements of comedy in it and this one should have followed suit (especially with flying fish!!!). Make-up legend Giannetto De Rossi did the effects for the film, however, the picture quality on the VHS I was watching was so muddled I couldn&apos;t appreciate them. The fish themselves are still accompanied by that menacing sound effect, so they still have that going for them. Unless you&apos;re a hardcore Lance Henriksen/James Cameron fan, I&apos;d say you can miss this one."

      "reviewBody": "Naked and Violent (1970) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nItalian Mondo movie tries to explain why America is a horrible place full of horrible people doing horrible things to other horrible people. In the film we learn that sex and violence is all that America has to offer and if people come here they will either end up on drugs or murdered in the violent streets, which are full of homeless thugs who will stop at nothing to get their next hit. If you think I&apos;m being a tad bit over dramatic then you haven&apos;t seen this film, which is also known as America HOW VIOLENT, HOW NAKED. The Mondo genre became quite popular after MONDO CANE so producers everywhere were jumping on the bandwagon and this here comes from the Martino clan with Sergio, best known for his future giallos, making his third stint behind the camera. A lot of Mondo movies take a look at poor countries or old fashioned countries that have strange customs so it was rather funny seeing a film take on America. Having lived here all my life I must admit that I had quite a few laughs at this film and the &quot;issues&quot; it tried to push off. By watching this film you&apos;d think the country was some toxic wasteland full of nothing but losers. The film mocks all the homeless people that can be found in New York and mentions that we leave the elderly people of this country to die in the streets. Again, I&apos;m not sure where word got out that we treat our elderly folks like this. We also see the various hippies smoking their pot and walking around naked, which again is looked down upon in this film. We learn that hippies have a mental defect that causes them to act like this and we learn that weed is one of the most dangerous drugs out there (I guess the Martino boys were watching REEFER MADNESS as a study course). As you can tell, the entire &quot;story&quot; being told here is pretty stupid and it makes you wonder if anyone involved in the production had any idea of what they were talking about or if they were just making these stories up as they went along. The portrait of the country is quite laughable and certainly doesn&apos;t show or tell anything the way it actually is. Having watched this it makes me curious how many other Mondo films are just 100% lies trying to push &quot;reality&quot; on those who might not know any better. Overall the film is pretty boring without any real good stories or adventures to go through. I think people living in America will get a few good laughs at a few of the stories here but I can&apos;t imagine too many others get any type of entertainment here. Fans of Martino won&apos;t find any of his style here either."

Her polish loving father reappears and wants the custody for her and get&apos;s it and takes her from Germany to Poland. The grandpa is angry and not able to understand how the youth welfare office could allow that. So he visits her and gets confronted with a different Poland than he had imagined but he is stubborn and grumpy and tries many shady actions and well the trouble continues. A very charming, thoughtful movie persiflaging the negative stereotypes that Germans have about Poland giving a fresh interesting view to a very close minded person. The acting is great, the drama and the thoughtful and funny moments fuse into a very entertaining and heart warming movie that I can only recommend.",

      "reviewBody": "Misión en Ginebra (1967) or Target Frankie or Feuer frei auf Frankie deals with an international scientist who discovers a new fuel for outer space . Then , he is murdered ; CIA chief (Waltere Barnes) assigns a dangerous mission to two important super-spies (Erika Blanc , Mariano Vidal Molina) to hire a playboy who &quot;just happens&quot; to look like his famous scientist brother . Posing as his brother , a known scientific , assistant to former killed scientist , he allows himself to be captured by the opposition, in order to thwart their schemes . After many car chases and intrigue, he arranges to get away with &quot;the secret plans&quot;. Our valiant , easy-going playboy/agent , takes on a powerful criminal organization commanded by Caldar (Tejada) and his hoodlums (Rik Battaglia , Eddi Arent, Tito Garcia , Tomas Torres) .   Ordinary Euro spy movie with usual tippings : pursuits , car crashes , chases , fantastic gadgets , strange artifacts , simple helicopters and explosive women . It has some flaws and gaps , as it does tend to get a bit old , including repetitive nature of some fight scenes , but it has big fun , so it cares . Joachim Fuchsberger gives a passable acting as a brave playboy turned secret agent who takes on an criminal organization that especializes in relevant assassinations . Joachim has an easy going air about him that makes him great to see . Co-stars two Eurotrash starletts as Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri .Along with a plethora of Spanish/American/German secondaries , usual in Spaghetti and Peplum , such as Walter Barnes , Rik Battaglia , Mariano Vidal Molina , Charles Fawcett , Oscar Pellicer , Tomas Torres, Gaspar &apos;Indio&apos; González and Tito García . \n\nIt packs a cololorful and evocative cinematography in Panavisión and Eastmancolor by Victor Monreal in terrific locations from Roma, Lazio, Italy , Geneva, Canton de Genève, Switzerland and Tremp, Lérida, Catalonia, Spain . And an atmospheric musical score in the seventies style by Piero Umiliani . The motion picture was regular wriitten/produced but professionally directed by José Antonio De La Loma , and it definitively worth checking out if you are a fan of Euro spy genre . Loma was a craftsman and real creator of ¨Quinqui sub-genre¨ ,. As Jose Antonio De La Loma , in his usual botcher style , filmed the successful trilogy : ¨Perros Callejeros I , II¨ and ¨Ultimos Golpes Del Torete¨ and he even made a female version : ¨Perras Callejeras¨ . His style is pretty much urban and realistic as well in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog and attempted to take a position in favor of outcast people . Jose Antonio De La Loma chose young and natural actors as Angel Fernandez Franco ¨Torete¨ and Bernard Seray who played their parts to the hilt , unafraid of filmmaker&apos;s unsympathetic camera and the particularity of the characters . In ¨Perros Callejeros¨ series we see their troubles growing in such streets , slums or &quot;barrios&quot; from Barcelona and outskirts and other coastal places and some fine locations . In these films Jose Antonio De La Loma showed the ugliness of those &quot;barrios&quot; , toughness and cold existence . In his youthful De La Loma worked as a teacher in the Chinese barrio of Barcelona and he lived poorness and isolation . As he hired true delinquents who used their peculiar slang and particular behaves , all of them give a certain realism to these offbeat films . ¨Tres Dias De Libertad¨ was absurdly directed by Juan Antonio De La Loma who had a long career including titles as a writer and a filmmaker in all kinds of genres , as Western : ¨Professional for a massacre¨ ,¨Texas Kid¨ ,¨Clint the solitary¨ , ¨Return of Clint¨, ¨The last Mohican¨, ¨Seven pistols for Timothy¨ , ¨Viva Carrancho¨, ¨The Boldest job in the West¨, ¨Blood at sundown¨or ¨Porque Seguir Matando¨ and Action : ¨Metralleta Stein¨ , ¨Razzia¨ , ¨Explosion¨ , Squadron: Counterforce¨or &quot;Playing with Death&quot; , ¨Goma 2¨ , ¨Tony Carrera¨, &quot;Playboy to Kill&quot; and several others",

Few movies can boast of leaving behind such a great legacy as this one, and still it remains very underrated and forgotten.\n\nThe story revolves around a man who time travels due to a series of unfortunate events. Though time travel is a very important part of the movie, its the human interaction and emotions that take the center stage. The concept is so unique and fun-filled that art amalgamates with commercial film making to create a unique blend of cinema. Traveling in both the past and the future is a brilliant thought, but a very dangerous one, since if badly executed it will be a big disaster. But, in this movie, past and future episodes are very well etched out and engaging. \n\nIf there is a sci-fi movie which is unparalleled in Telugu cinema, it is Aditya 369. The mother of all sci-fi in Telugu cinema. An easy 10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I guess I have a soft spot, a very small one, for this forgotten film, which was directed by horror icon Robert Englund. I think it&apos;s because it came out at the end of the 80&apos;s, which is the decade I saw the majority of my horror films, as I consider myself a horror buff. I&apos;ve seen it listed as either 1988 or 1989, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen many more horror films since then, as the 80&apos;s wrapped up my teen years. An interesting tidbit has star Stephen Geoffreys basically become a gay porn star not long after this film came out, no pun intended. You probably won&apos;t recognize anyone else, other than perhaps Sandy Dennis, and maybe Robert Picardo. I thought the premise of the film was fairly original; you call a &quot;horrorscope&quot; number, and you get to speak to the Devil. There&apos;s a catch though, if you don&apos;t do what &quot;he&quot; says, you get a strange sounding ring on a nearby pay phone(remember them?)and bad stuff may happen to you. Buyer beware! I&apos;ll get the bad out of the way; first off, I didn&apos;t like how Hoax decided to play a cruel, but deadly joke on Suzie, considering she was very nice to him, and even tried to protect him from bullies. Her death scene was pretty lame, as far as horror standards go. Also, the way the house turned into a foamy ice inside, and the fire effects under the house, were cheesy at best. I did like the creature&apos;s make-up for the most part, although the extra large hands and feet could&apos;ve been done better. I also thought the fish falling from the sky was interesting, and I haven&apos;t seen anything like it before or after this film. Mark Dark was a very cool addition, but I wish there was more background on his character. To finish this review, I&apos;ll reiterate that this has some late 80&apos;s charm to me, and was probably one of the last horror films I saw, at least from what I can recall, as the 80&apos;s gave me some really cool horror film memories, and I&apos;ll proudly include this film as well."

Ronnie Jackson is a San Francisco photographer specialising in taking pictures of babies. His great ambition, however, is to be a private detective, and hopes to be taken on as an assistant by Sam McCloud, a private eye whose offices are in the same building as Jackson&apos;s studio. McCloud has always resisted, but one day Jackson gets his big chance when he is mistaken for the great man by a potential client. A young woman named Carlotta Montay asks Jackson, whom she believes to be McCloud, to trace her elderly husband who has mysteriously disappeared. Jackson eagerly accepts the assignment.\n\nThe rest of the plot does not really matter. (It concerns a battle to control the mining rights to uranium deposits in South America). The whole point of the film is to parody the &quot;film noir&quot; style of film-making, particularly films based on &quot;hardboiled&quot; detective stories like &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; or &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;. (I am informed that the film to which &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; bears the greatest resemblance is &quot;Farewell My Lovely&quot;, which I have never seen). The film introduces a selection of stock characters from films of this type- apart from the private eye himself there is the sultry femme fatale (here played by Dorothy Lamour in a move away from her &quot;sarong girl&quot; image), the soft-spoken but sinister foreign villain (played by Peter Lorre, parodying the parts he played in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Man who Knew Too Much&quot; and other films) and the wheelchair-bound old man (like General Sternwood in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;). There is a typically convoluted noir plot, a gloomy Gothic mansion, a frantic car chase and the sort of cynical, slangy, wisecracking voice-over one could imagine being delivered by Humphrey Bogart. (The house is so big that &quot;you could shoot quail in the hall&quot;).\n\nThe film&apos;s central joke is that, not only is Jackson not a private eye, he is also most unsuited to that particular line of work. He is a character of a sort played by Bob Hope in a number of his other comedies, the man who pretends to be tough, brave and resourceful but who in real life is both cowardly and inept. (In his work as a photographer he even allows himself to be terrorised by a baby).\n\nSeen as a pure comedy, this is not the best, although there are a few amusing gags, such as the lunatic asylum inmates playing golf without a ball, Lon Chaney&apos;s musclebound but stupid warder, a joke at the expense of Hope&apos;s odd-shaped nose (&quot;I&apos;ll personally punch you in the nose so hard it will look like other peoples&apos; noses&quot;) and the scene where Hope, trying to record Lorre&apos;s confession to a murder, keeps pulling the plug out of the socket. Anyone, however, who is familiar with the conventions of the film noir genre will be amused by this affectionate parody. 6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Curse of the Demon&quot; (aka &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;) is one of those weird little lost films that everyone agrees is wonderful and yet very few people seem to have actually seen.  This is one of those rare British movies that is set, not in the city, but rather in the chilly, fog-choked countryside where little seems to have changed since Stonehenge was built.  Niall McGinnis holds sway here as the impish leader of a Satanic cult, who swiftly dispatches of his critics by summoning a huge, horrific demon to rip them to shreds.\n\nInto this isolated world walks psychologist John Holden, played by yet another seriously underrated actor, Dana Andrews.  Andrews, who made a name for himself playing tough guys in films like &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; is wonderful here as the skeptical, even slightly smarmy, American who absolutely refuses to believe in demons, even when strange, unexplainable things begin to happen to him.  Peggy Cummins is his love interest, the open minded schoolteacher whose uncle may have been a victim of the Demon.  Niall McGinnis is disturbingly likable as the head of the Demon Cult, chucking aside a chance to play Aleister Crowley and opting for Benny Hill instead.  He is very disarming as the films central villain, and Andrews confusion mirrors our own as the movie stalks relentlessly through a seance, a stormy Halloween party and a frightening hypnosis session to its surprisingly violent conclusion.\n\nThis movie is, by turns, sarcastically funny, suffocatingly tense and shockingly scary.  The demon looks a little corny nowadays, and was revealed much too quickly with no suspenseful build-up, but the movie is so smart, so moody, so creepy and well done with an excellent cast to boot, that one can easily forgive the demon, which looks a lot like a slightly deformed bear with a pig nose and goat horns.  \n\nThis is an excellent adaption of the short story &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; by M. R. James and still has the power to scare even 50 years later.  Highly recommended!"

Movies that call video their home do it for sometimes a much deserved reason: they stink. This is not the case with Phoenix however.\n\nIt&apos;s a breath of fresh air to take a chance on a direct-to-video quickie and have it turn out this good. The story is tight and look at all the recognizable faces in the cast. That helps me out. The whole police officer-gambling junky angle is different - Liotta as the lead carries it off well and Phoenix is just all around better than most cop boilers I&apos;ve seen in the last six months. It sure ain&apos;t lacking in clichés of the genre, but that has come to be expected. Phoenix is just a well filmed, nicely acted piece of work from director Danny Cannon who makes amends for the theatrical bomb Judge Dredd. Worth a look on a slow night or for Liotta fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Whether I was into the subject or not, there&apos;s always a filmmaker at work in a Spike Lee film... he&apos;s one moviemaker who never loses sight of being a filmmaker first and foremost, and he&apos;s absolutely outdone himself with INSIDE MAN, a taut thriller which avoids the colloquialism that alienated mainstream audiences from some of his earlier work.\n\nIf you&apos;ve seen the trailer or heard anything about this pic, you have been misled. Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I&apos;m going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.\n\nFrom the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven&apos;t seen in years. I&apos;d almost give this one a ten.. and I don&apos;t hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.\n\nThis is one film where there isn&apos;t a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going&apos;s supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius. I can&apos;t praise this one enough.\n\nChristopher Plummer is superb, in what is (perhaps coincidentally) an ironic bit of casting. Jodie Foster rises to a challenging persona with aplomb and ease, and my only complaint of the entire exercise is that her character&apos;s name &apos;Madeline White&apos; is perhaps a little cliché. Beyond that, there isn&apos;t a filmmaker alive who brings New York to the screen with anything approximating Spike Lee&apos;s vision.\n\nIt seems there hasn&apos;t been a lot of junket for this one, and that Spike Lee&apos;s presence has been downplayed... as if the studio downplayed the fact that this is a Spike Lee film slightly, until the word was out that this film is over and beyond what an audience might already expect from one of his films.\n\nSo... let me just say.. man o man this is a cinematic mind-blowing amazing one and a half hours... it&apos;s brilliant, tight, funny, articulate, intense, and high time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect.",

The demigod doesn&apos;t need to be told twice and takes the scheming schemer from Ithaca to task. Of course, this cannot be achieved without complications. In the face of impending dangers from outside, the two hunky musclemen pull together and realize the value of true male friendship...\n\nDirector Mario Caiano has presented an at least unusual approach to the peplum genre by essentially discovering the buddy movie in the sandal film. Of course, there are also beautiful women who need to be saved from numerous dangers. Alessandra Panaro, Dominique Boschero and the Italian television legend Raffaella Carra take on this task.\n\nIt was shot on the Canary Islands, which is also rather unusual for a sandal film. 341,000 tickets were sold in West German cinemas.\n\nCertainly not a masterpiece of the genre, but very varied and enjoyable!",

      "reviewBody": "Unfairly judged as a rip off of Gremlins from 1984, Critters should be thought of as a fun film taking all it can from the glorious peak of 50s sci-fi creature features. From the Critters themselves to every other character in the film, it shouts out as a colourised version of a 50s staple.\n\nCritters escape from a space prison and head for another planet, Kansas {well OK then, Earth}, here they intend to eat every thing that gets in their way. The inhabitants of a small town don&apos;t know what has hit them, but aided by a couple of intergalactic bounty hunters, they fight back to hopefully rid their homes of the furry maniacal Critters.\n\nWatching this is like watching a roll call for every stereotypical character ever put into a creature feature film. Cute kid who could be a hero, nice but dim farm hand, homely family with guts and verve, the sheriff who is just not gonna believe what is happening no matter what evidence is produced, and etc. Yet it works because they are homaging past masters, they aren&apos;t trying to kid anyone that it&apos;s a new idea, it&apos;s good fun that doesn&apos;t outstay its welcome.\n\nThe Critters are great, furry balls of fury with a shed load of teeth that are backed up by off the cuff subtitles to enthasize their grumblings. Genre babe Dee Wallace Stone gets to do her stuff, whilst M Emett Walsh has fun as sceptical sheriff Harv. It&apos;s not a classic genre piece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is fun {witness a delightful E.T. scene}, and I for one look forward to part two later in the week. 6.5/10",

It actually pushed me to create a channel and comment.\n\nI remember I put this movie on in the middle of my Banderas binge-watch, not expecting much, and - because of the rates - waiting for it to go bad any second. But to my delight, it didn&apos;t!\n\nThe plot got me involved. Sarah seemed to be surrounded with truly vicious men, so I started to suspect each one of being the bad guy. But I still didn&apos;t see the final twist coming.\n\nWhile pondering on the suspects, I also enjoyed the way a sexual tension between Sarah and Tony was pictured. They click with each other! Especially it&apos;s seen while compared to &quot;Original sin&quot; (another erotic thriller with Antonio). Even though I find Angelina Jolie astonishingly beautiful, in that movie I didn&apos;t feel any chemistry between her and Antonio at all, but here I saw a genuine passion between him and Rebecca De Mornay.\n\nI also really liked some power moves from Sarah - they were not that common for 90s, so they added spice to the picture.\n\nTo sum up - I recommend to watch this movie, if you are in the mood for light mysteries, blood-boiling sex scenes and esthetic of 90s. It&apos;s interesting, relaxing and pleasent for your eyes.\n\nI don&apos;t recommend it, if you are into super-scary stuff or expect to tempt your intelligence with highly difficult riddles.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I have just seen the movie on TV and I was a little bit curious to read what other has written about it.\n\nFirst of all, Total Reality is of course no good movie.\n\n It has stupid dialogues, some really dumb figures (e.g. the feds), awful sci-fi interior design, the story has holes you can send one of the spaceships through it, the photography is boring  and some details are annoying (e.g. the future handguns are simple 20th century weapons like Calico or FAMAS)\n\nBut, on the other hand: the space CGI are nice animated, it has no romantic happy end, Misa Koprova is indeed very beautiful (Sic Coyote is right!), the plot has some really interesting parts (the idea of a proto-fascist book becomes the bringer of world/solar war).\n\nThe reason, why I have watched the movie was Thomas Kretschmann, a not so famous german actors as the antagonist. His character (and his buddy) is the point I don`t understand. Why is he shown as the bad guy, although he wanted to save the future from the war?\n\n An interesting B-movie. Sometimes nice, sometimes stupid. If you are bored at 1am you can watch it. Or you can go to sleep. ;-)"

      "reviewBody": "The &apos;Krimi&apos; genre is mostly made up of films based on stories by novelist Edgar Wallace and many of the best of them were directed by the prolific Alfred Vohrer. The Monster of London City does not benefit from the input of either of these two genre luminaries and is undoubtedly one of the weaker films of its type out there. As mentioned, the film is not based on a novel by Edgar Wallace; but it does boast perhaps the next best thing as the story used for this film was penned by none other than Wallace&apos;s son, Bryan Edgar Wallace. Like many films of this type, the story takes influence from the murders committed by Jack the Ripper and we focus on a stage play about the serial killer. Unfortunately, someone has taken it upon themselves to begin copying The Ripper and is murdering girls throughout London. Naturally this means that a harrowing eye is cast upon the play; and the lead actor soon becomes the chief suspect in the investigation carried out by the London police.\n\nNaturally the film is set in London; and director Edwin Zbonek does a good job of capturing the fog drenched streets which help to give the film a thick and foreboding atmosphere. It&apos;s often the style that I like most about these films; and while this one is not so heavy on the style as some other films in this genre; the style is once again the best thing about it. The cast list does not include any well known actors; although as an ensemble there is nothing wrong with the performances. The story is the biggest let-down, however, as while there are certainly opportunities for a good, strong thriller here; it unfortunately falls somewhat short of the potential. There is very little in the way of suspense and therefore it is easy to get rather bored with the investigation. Naturally the murders are not very grisly; but they&apos;re not really memorable either and this also harms the film. The ending is a particular disappointment and can be seen coming a mile away. Overall, this film might be worth a look if you&apos;re a big Krimi fan, but I wouldn&apos;t bother with it otherwise.",

Sonny was raised with brutality by her father and is a traumatized woman that was submitted to therapy by Dr. Cloey (Lesley-Anne Down). Sonny&apos;s boyfriend, the DA Barrett Tanner (Sonny Marinelli), helps her to bring her things to her new home.\n\nOn the arrival, her next door neighbor advises Sonny that the paperboy (Daniel Ross Owens) is a dangerous weirdo. Sonny finds that the paperboy has broken in her house and might have killed her father, but Detectives Briggs (Ray Wise) and Sabatino (Tom Tarantini) do not believe on Sonny and think that it is her imagination. When Barrett is attacked and is missing, Sonny and her friend Paula Crenshaw (Lauren Vélez) call the police but he is not found in the house. Is Sonny freaking out or is the paperboy an evil being? &quot;Rosewood Lane&quot; is a laughable horror movie with terrible story and screenplay with many plot holes. I have already spent my time watching this garbage and it does not worth to spend more time writing about this awful film. If you do not believe on my words, do the same I did to feel how bad a movie can be. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Vila do Medo&quot; (&quot;The Villa of the Fear&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Margaret&quot; took years to get to us, seemingly even longer to play out, but tells a story so poetic and heartbreakingly real that you couldn&apos;t imagine it any other way. Lisa (Anna Paquin) is a teenager; she&apos;s lost in her own world by her own misguided arrogance, but she must come to terms with death and the true nature of a tragic accident.\n\nThe film starts with Lisa in high school determinedly getting her way even though she probably doesn&apos;t deserve to. Nonchalantly waiting &apos;til class is over and wearing a skirt too short, she saunters her way to the front where her math teacher, Mr. Aaron (Matt Damon), chastises her for her poor grades. But with a slightly flirtatious tone, Lisa settles the matter with a supposedly shared understanding that it&apos;s okay because math won&apos;t factor into her future.\n\nLater, Lisa sets out to find a stylish but functional cowboy hat in the middle of New York City. She is unsuccessful until she spies one on the head of a boyishly handsome bus driver (Mark Ruffalo) and jauntily jogs beside it determined to get his attention to both: find out where he got his hat; and also to quench a teenage girl&apos;s desire of just getting his attention. She succeeds; he drives through a red light, and kills a pedestrian in the process.\n\nLisa immediately feels the pain, guilt and remorse and tries to ease the woman&apos;s passage into the afterlife. The film then becomes a character study of a teenage girl determined to get past the pain and aftermath of a tragedy caused by a simple accident. The fascinating parts of this film involve how our lead character becomes less sympathetic but more fragile while remaining equally reckless.\n\nQuestions about the cause and nature of mortality are raised, and most interestingly what are the moral and immoral ways to respond to it. The film&apos;s title comes from the poem &quot;Spring and Fall: (Margaret, Are You Grieving?)&quot; written by Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1880. Margaret is a child who must come to terms with the loss of her innocence. &quot; And yet you will weep and know why. Now no matter, child, the name; Sorrow&apos;s springs are the same.&quot; Lisa&apos;s English teacher (Matthew Broderick) recites this poem to the class. Lisa is, at times, a typical teenager, bent on having things her way, always having her point heard. But now the shaky foundations which her arrogance is based on begin to crumble and we don&apos;t know and she doesn&apos;t know if she&apos;s still innocent or where she lost it.\n\nThe shortened released version of &quot;Margaret&quot; clocks in at over two and a half hours; edited down from the three-hour director&apos;s cut. But because of the universal tale of life and death that it tells, it needs the length. It doesn&apos;t have a simple plot, and Lisa is not a simple character. It can definitely seem errant with its uneven editing, but that&apos;s probably going to be an expected outcome of 6 years&apos; worth of legal and creative battles going on behind the scenes.\n\nBroderick and Ruffalo re-team from Lonergan&apos;s previous indie success &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; (2000), but don&apos;t expect any actor to show more range or emotion than Anna Paquin. Everything goes through Lisa.",

In fact, for the first 80 minutes, nothing much happens.  Yes, Taylor is quite handsome in his military uniform and, yes, Ms. Wynter is very fetching in her military uniform and, yes, a predictable romance develops with an equally predictable ending, but THAT&apos;S IT!!  That&apos;s the whole plodding film in a nutshell. Believe us, if movies about the greatest invasion in history are the sort of thing that floats your boat, you would be much better advised to stick with &quot;The Longest Day&quot;.  This over-processed turkey spread shoulda stayed in the can."

      "reviewBody": "For reasons explained in my review of &quot;Kickboxer 2: The Road Back&quot;, I STILL had not seen the first one when I wrote a review that included a plot summary. I have since found out there is another way to include a detailed plot summary.\n\nThis film is more of a comedy than the second one, and that&apos;s fine with me. Most of the scenes with David and Xian are funny, as are many scenes with Marcos. Even the villains give us some funny lines.\n\nIn the first film, Sasha Mitchell didn&apos;t seem that much like Cody. But he either hadn&apos;t played the character yet or hadn&apos;t played him very long. In this film, the Cody personality is there from his first line. That&apos;s not to say he is always there. Sometimes Mitchell is quite serious and tough. But either playing Cody all those years reduced his IQ or David has been getting hit in the head too much. Since I liked Cody, it was okay with me.\n\nDennis Chan isn&apos;t quite as good as in the second movie, in terms of quality, but he is a lot funnier.\n\nNoah Verduzco does a very good job as young Marcos, and unlike Joey from the first movie, a similar character, he gets to stay around for the entire movie.\n\nOne of the villains is in charge of some kind of holiday celebration involving dancing by the locals. They&apos;re quite talented.\n\nA woman selling some kind of merchandise has only a couple of lines but is very convincing as a real Brazilian.\n\nThere is nice music in Frank Lane&apos;s restaurant, where it appears wealthy men are being set up with hookers. Later in Frank&apos;s restaurant, there is more good music, this time with a female vocalist, and dancing.\n\nAnd there&apos;s a great fall out of a window. To which David responds, &quot;Now THAT&apos;s number seven!&quot;\n\nThe fighting is good, if you like that sort of thing. It&apos;s not nearly as bloody as in the second movie, and in fact this one had a TV-PG rating when I saw it while the other was TV-14. But don&apos;t be fooled: this still isn&apos;t family fare.\n\nIt&apos;s entertaining enough."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Black Butler&quot; is a beloved manga that my daughter and friends liked very much. So when a movie version came out, they were all excited to go see it. I have not read the manga &quot;Kuroshitsuji&quot; yet, so I felt I needed to see the film first myself before she does to see if it is okay for her age group. The local film classification board had rated it R- 13, but they had not been entirely consistent the way they classify films per appropriate age.\n\nThe beginning narration sets the film in a near future time, when the world was divided into East and West. The West was headed by a Queen who sent her &quot;watchdogs&quot; to keep her enemies at check. \n\nIn such a world, a &quot;Demon&apos;s Curse&quot; killer is going around killing diplomats by some sort of gruesome instant mummification process. Alarmed, the Queen chooses an orphaned aristocrat, Earl Genpo Kiyoharu, as her &quot;watchdog&quot; to get to the bottom of this matter. \n\nThe young Earl has under his service a butler of many skills, Sebastian, who does whatever his young master wills him to. It turns out that Sebastian&apos;s talents are because of his demonic nature, for which the Earl will have to pay for with his soul. \n\nI believe that this film deviates much from the book by making Kiyoharu to be actually a girl Shiori pretending to be a boy in order to secretly exact revenge on her parents&apos; killers. This also made it possible for a love angle to develop between master and servant, which of course was not in the original manga. The original setting in the manga was Victorian England, but here we only get the Victorian-looking grand manor and colorful gardens of the Genpo family instead.\n\nThe opening sequence alone where Sebastian takes on an entire warehouse full of gangsters only with his butter knife sets the incredible whimsical tone for the whole film. There would be violent fight scenes, murder scenes, death scenes, as well as scenes of drug abuse, and the disturbing demonic subplot, which would automatically make this film rated R-16 in my book. In between these violent scenes though, the film&apos;s momentum dips a lot with long talky explanatory scenes.\n\nThe acting department is on the campy side. The lead actors playing Sebastian and Kiyoharu are both androgynous-looking which seems to be the current rage among the younger generation. There was even more campy acting from the actors playing the clumsy maid Lynn and Kiyoharu&apos;s guardian, his Auntie Hanae. All the one-dimensional villains they faced also come from the same school of exaggerated campy acting.\n\nOverall, this is a confused film with a rather convoluted plot which did not have a clear direction that it wanted to take. If we were to only judge it with this film, it does make me wonder what those fans of the original manga loved in it. This film alone is occasionally entertaining anyway but it most probably could have been done or adapted much better than what came out now.",

The movie made us laugh out loud and reflect on how special it is that we&apos;re all together. We loved it and I &apos;secretly&apos; cried.\n\nBecause the movie starts with a scene describing how snowflakes are all different, my woke alert went off but luckily my fear was unfounded.\n\nThe theme of dealing with a loss in the family is brought very delicate and tasteful. The monkey cgi was surprisingly good and was never annoying.\n\nThe overall atmosphere, locations and set dressing are outstanding. The actors are dubbed but I forgot that quickly. So, don&apos;t hesitate if you&apos;re in for an inspiring, funny, feel good movie to watch with your kids.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a real shame.  &quot;Texas Rangers&quot;, Steve Miner&apos;s new take on the founding of the famous band of Old West law enforcers, was held back from release for almost a whole year, subjected to numerous re-edits, dumped into theatres without any fanfare, and greeted with apathy and pathetic grosses.  And you know what?  It&apos;s one of the most entertaining films I&apos;ve seen all year.\n\n The film stars James Van Der Beek as an upright Eastern inventor&apos;s son who, on his first trip to the wild west, sees his parents and brothers killed before his eyes by marauding bandits.  Desperate for revenge, he enlists with the Rangers, a more-or-less vigilante band led by Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), an ex-Confederate soldier with a vendetta of his own. McNelly&apos;s band of young gunslingers battle their way across the Texas border country, sniffing out bandits, doling out frontier justice, romancing the women-folk, etc., etc.\n\nIn other words, &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; does nothing you can&apos;t see in any B-western on Saturday afternoon TV.  It&apos;s just that it does most of it a lot better than we&apos;ve seen for quite some time.  After the rather too glossy &quot;American Outlaws&quot;, it&apos;s nice to get a Western with a gritty, authentic look.  The towns look appropriately small and weather-beaten, the costumes nice and trail-worn.  The only gloss here is on the guns...and I guess some of those young cowpokes are kind of glittery, too.\n\nMiner&apos;s direction is curiously hot and cold here.  He excels in quiet moments, dialogue and character, but his action scenes sometimes come up short.  He seems particularly to have a bad habit of always putting his camera in the wrong place when his quick action payoffs arrive (bullets hitting home, knives landing on target).  Still, the picture moves with lots of energy and excitement, and Miner is definitely to thank for that. Also, he scores in the big action climax, where the Rangers storm the desperadoes&apos; Mexican hideout.  Here, the camera always finds the right spot, and the result is a fast, pulse-quickening blowout.\n\nA fine cast gives a lot of luster to the material.  James Van Der Beek has never been just another WB pretty boy, and he takes to the Western with grace and conviction.  Ashton Kutcher is okay as a hayseed gunman, but at times comes off a little too much like he&apos;s still on &quot;That &apos;70s Show&quot;. Usher Raymond is nicely understated as a former-slave ranger, and while Rachael Leigh Cook&apos;s rancher&apos;s daughter is really superfluous to the plot, her gorgeous face is absolutely essential.  Fine supporting turns dot the picture, with standouts being Randy Travis and Robert Patrick as McNelly&apos;s lieutenants and Vincent Spano as a cocky, villainous gunslinger.\n\nReally, though, this is Dylan McDermott&apos;s show.  I have never been much of a fan of &quot;The Practice&quot;, and was stunned by the force and power of McDermott&apos;s work here.  He carries himself with solid-as-a-rock strength, and handles his quieter emotional moments with consummate restraint.  He also looks superbly the part, eyes glowering beneath his black hat, guns blazing away from the back of his horse.  Of course, it also helps that Scott Busby and Martin Copeland&apos;s screenplay turns McNelly into a complex and fascinating character.  Haunted by the memory of his wife and child, (stolen by bandits while he was off in the wars), dogged by a sickness that is bearing down on his soul, always trusting the gun and the noose over the badge and the lawbook, McNelly is a classic western hero, bigger than life and still movingly human.  It&apos;s a terrific performance, one of the best I&apos;ve seen this year, and it makes me wish that they&apos;ll keep making westerns just so McDermott can keep acting in them.\n\nOf course, they won&apos;t keep making them if people won&apos;t get off their duffs and go see the good ones when they come along.  And trust me, &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; is one of the good ones, a top-class B-picture with an A-list lead performance.  Give it a look, if it&apos;s still at your local theatre.  I guarantee you won&apos;t be sorry you did."

      "reviewBody": "Beware of Adult industry award-winners: a corrupt marketing ploy that has nothing to do with reality. This loser was gifted as &quot;best high-end all- sex release&quot;, an idiotic, made-up category with keyword &quot;high-end&quot;, right out of the p.r. toolkit.\n\nDirected by one &quot;Joshua&quot; for cameraman B. Skow, it&apos;s merely a round-up of top femme talent humping away in an industrial setting that reminded me of far better, far more atmospheric (and industry ignored perhaps out of unconscious racism) Alexander DeVoe epics shot for West Coast Productions a half dozen years earlier. DeVoe had a knack for putting his sex scenes into cold &amp; clammy locations filled with lathes and other artifacts of our nation&apos;s former heavy manufacturing presence, but Joshua &amp; Skow have no thematic pretensions -only interested in delivering 3 hours of mechanical sex.\n\nThe underlying gimmick here is: how can you go wrong by hiring the best femmes in the business? Skow &amp; company clearly never read &quot;Money Ball&quot; or saw the Brad Pitt movie, because they would have learned, just like the latter-day Yankees ball club, that just rounding up the most expensive and popular subjects doesn&apos;t substitute for creativity.\n\nSo we get six dreary sex sequences, each run into the ground for a half hour, with superstars like Sunny Leone, Eva Angelina and near-greats Alexis Texas, Teagan Presley, SHwna Lenee, Kagney Linn Karter and Lexi Belle pawed and manhandled by the current big-dick brigade including Mr. Marcus for IR purposes. Most videos have new faces or ringers for variety but not this one. Homework assignment: add up the credits for each performer and then add on an additional 25% or so (IMDb is far from complete) and see how close we come to 10,000 features or videos between them (counting overlap).\n\nWith zero content (story), there is the minimum daily requirement of group-sex, lesbian action, fetish, anal, you name it. Angelina and Presley are credited as executive producers, but this ends up strictly a bread job, adding nothing to the illustrious careers of those participating. I sat through it a couple of months ago and have no specific recollection (images) of any of the scenes, so ephemeral is this gonzo approach."

The crew of &quot;Belle&quot; are made up of a youth inflected cast of actors headed by the likes of Eric Stoltz, Sean Astin, Billy Zane and Matthew Modine, while John Lithgow and David Strathairn provide the mature acting weight on the ground hoping that the boys come back safely.\n\nIn truth it&apos;s all a bit too predictable, but never insultingly so, though research into the real exploits of the brave heroes involved reveals that Hollywood has, well, been Hollywood. Tech credits are a mixture of the brilliant and the poor, but when it involves the aerial sequences the film is stunning, and the makers do a sterling job of making &quot;Belle&apos;s&quot; final flight suspenseful and emotionally potent. 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "I have a copy of Witchfinder General from many years ago. Recently, whilst re-organising my collection, I happened upon it and watched it once more. This film still manages to induce general feelings of horror on account of its violence, even though it is not really a &apos;horror&apos; film as such. Watch it for its superb cinematography which lends it an appearance of freshness that belies its 35 years. It still looks as if it could have been made yesterday. Some of the more violent scenes will make you squirm. The cruelty of the period portrayed can only be imagined and the cheapness of life comes across as truly shocking. Vincent Price is excellent as Hopkins (though maybe a bit &apos;mature&apos; to portray him, since he was witchfinding in his late twenties and died in his early thirties). To think that this evil man really existed and operated unchecked for several years leaves one cold. A minor masterpiece that all lovers of the macabre should enjoy."

Before he entered the booth we saw Stu talking on his cell phone as a PR-man, constantly lying to people. The sniper has observed Stu and thinks he deserves to die.\n\nWhen the sniper demonstrates he is real by shooting a pimp near the booth the police arrives and thinks Stu is the shooter. Capt. Ramey (Forest Whitaker) slowly understands things are not as they seem.\n\nColin Farrell who is in almost every scene is great. First he looks so confident and slowly he becomes more and more desperate. The voice of the sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) is also perfect for the movie. It sounds calm but creepy, like a dangerous man who knows what he is doing.\n\nThe movie is not very long and here that is a very good thing. Scenes are not dragged to make the movie as long as most movies and therefor it doesn&apos;t get boring. It kept me on the edge of my seat. A very good thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "Saved! is a movie that will get to the hearts of people everywhere. It so poignantly captures the hardships and comedies of being a teenage girl.\n\nJena Malone is Mary, a typical teen attending a Christian school. After finding out her boyfriend is gay, a vision of Jesus provokes her to &quot;cure&quot; him by sleeping with him. But when Christian Mary finds out that she is pregnant, all hell breaks loose! She tries to hide the pregnancy, but it becomes difficult. Mary is shunned by her outgoing and devoutly Christian friend Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), and finds solace with the uniquely rebellious Cassandra (Eva Amurri), who also happens to be the only Jew in the school. Mary also finds a friend in Patrick (Patrick Fugit), the pastor&apos;s son. Mary puts up with a lot from Hilary Faye and her friends trying to save her- even the pastor gets involved: &quot;I want you to help&quot; ... &quot;You mean shoot her?&quot; &quot;No... I was thinking something a little less &apos;gangsta&apos;&quot;. But when Hilary Faye goes too far, Cassandra, Mary, Patrick, and Hilary Faye&apos;s cool but wheelchair-bound brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) team up to let Hilary Faye know that she can be &quot;down with G-O-D&quot;, but has to be understanding of others as well.\n\nThe movie is full of hilarious lines and activities, but it remains believable. Malone portrays a typical teenager who is just trying to fit in and have fun despite her differences. Parts of the movie had me cracking up and quoting it for days on end, other parts were tear-provokingly sweet. As a whole, Saved! is one movie that you can&apos;t afford to miss. It just may save us all.",

The hot breath of competition in the person of Jan-Michael Vincent is breathing down his neck. Reynolds prizes the fact that he&apos;s the best in the business, but it&apos;s a young man game that demands a young man&apos;s reflexes.\n\nBrian Keith knows how Reynolds feels, Reynolds dethroned him as number one and Reynolds keeps company with Keith&apos;s daughter Sally Field who would dearly love it if both of the men in her life would just get out of that rough business. \n\nHooper has little plot to it, it&apos;s a character study of the people who go into that line of work and a touch of insanity seems to be a needed ingredient for success. The title role is something that fits Reynolds like a made to measure suit\n\nJohn Marley is in the cast as your stereotypical ulcer ridden producer and Robert Klein has a great part as a truly obnoxious director, one of his early good ones. And of course the stunt work stands out on its own as well as being an integral part of the plot.\n\nHooper even got an Oscar nomination in the Sound category. A definite must for Burt Reynolds fans.",

      "reviewBody": "BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH is the story of a group of black friends who return to their hometown after a stint in Vietnam. Fed up with the harassment and abuse from the &quot;Nighthawks of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; they decide to organize black voter registration to take control of their town. Of course, the KKK (and their pink robed Grand Cyclops!) won&apos;t stand for this, and so the battle between the Klan and the black Nam vets begins.....\n\nWith the exception of the sympathetic Sheriff, the white characters are cartoonishly evil goons. What do you expect though? The soundtrack is repetitive, but funky, if you like that sort of thing. The only thing this movie might be good at is explaining civics to a group of fifth graders. The rest of you will probably be bored to tears....\n\nIf you pick this one up, check out the beginning and the end only. Or better yet watch the trailer, as it has ALL of the good scenes from the movie condensed into about three minutes.",

Someone out there decides to teach him a lesson by placing his bigoted noggin on the body of a black convict (former professional football star Rosey Grier). The heads fight, punch each other and go through many other genuinely (and unintentionally) hilarious slapstick scenes. Try not to laugh watching Grier running around or riding on a motorcycle with a ridiculous-looking fake dummy-head planted on his shoulders.\n\nNot to be confused with THE INCREDIBLE TWO HEADED TRANSPLANT (1971) or Andy Milligan&apos;s THE MAN WITH TWO HEADS (1972).\n\nScore: 5 out of 10 (Though a MUST for camp aficionados!)",

And I must say that I enjoyed it. Maybe it is a bit too long clocking in at 9à minutes. The could have gone for 70 minutes like the old ones. It&apos;s shot in black and white but it all happens nowadays. As I have said, there isn&apos;t any gore or almost no red stuff in it but I was surprised that they added some gratuitous nudity in it were one was a strip scene. It&apos;s weird that the producers dared to make such a old school one in a time were gore is hot.

Aubrey James (Parker Stevenson) is his ambitious young rival. Lugs (Jim Nabors) is his crew chief. He is taken with virginal Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson). She&apos;s Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty)&apos;s new employee. When Stroker loses his sponsor, he signs up with untrustworthy Fried Chicken king Torkle as The Fastest Chicken in the South. He grows to hate his contract and tries to get out of it.\n\nThis is Burt Reynolds at his most Burt Reynolds. As a kid, I didn&apos;t really mind the bad writing and didn&apos;t get some of the jokes. It wasn&apos;t my favorite racing movie but I didn&apos;t know the critical panning this received. I love Cannonball Run and I knew this is inferior. Watching it again recently gave me a few more problems. Loni is a big robotic problem. Her innocent act does not work. The writing is not that funny either. It&apos;s just a lot of camp from the cast. I don&apos;t actually hate this but it&apos;s not good.",

The basic storyline is that a shoe repairman loses his memory and has to remind himself of who he is based off looking at all of his possessions in his apartment.... shoes! It&apos;s really hilarious. It follows this neat short story kind of motif where he&apos;ll pick up a pair of say dancing shoes then it cuts to a little flash backesque kind of thing where he imagines himself as a famous flamenco dancer! GREAT FILM! Watch it with your entire family. I don&apos;t want to say anything about the ending, but let&apos;s just say he comes out a different AND better man than he was in the begging of the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "American director John Guillermin, known for several epic &quot;clunkers&quot;, pulls together this rather tense look at one of the most important battles of World War II: American forces clash with the Germans at Remagen, where the last intact bridge over the Rhine stands between the two opposing forces.\n\nThe script divides attention evenly and fairly between the two forces. George Segal (&quot;The Longest Day&quot;) is Lt. Hartman, a burned out and pretty tired junior officer who doesn&apos;t want to accept the responsibilities of command when his company commander is killed. The war is almost over, and Hartman is concerned with getting his men home. On the other side of the river, German Major Kreuger (Robert Vaughn) is equally concerned with saving lives  German lives. He becomes obsessed with keeping the bridge intact in order to allow retreating German soldiers to attack, despite orders from the High Command to blow up the bridge to prevent its&apos; capture by the Allies.\n\nThe supporting cast is filled with fine performances. The standouts are Hans Christian Blech (&quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;) as Captain Schmidt, a weary Wehrmacht Officer who feels his duty is to protect the civilians whom Kreuger puts in harm&apos;s way by continuing a hopeless fight. Blech&apos;s acting ability ranges from quiet humility to occasional fits of rage, bringing a dimensionality to a role not commonly found in war epics. Joachim Hansen (&quot;Breakthrough&quot;) disagrees with Schmidt; he is devoted to the High Command and wants a battle with the Americans more than anything. Both actors bring passion to their roles and make these very believable wartime officers, not simply normal caricatures and stereotypes.\n\nGuillermin takes these characters and puts them in intense combat situations, making their humanity all the more believable. The best battle scene in the film has a platoon of American soldiers advancing onto the bridge under a smokescreen, but while they are in the open, the smoke begins to clear giving the Germans a clear field of fire. As some men are shot in the open, others move underneath the bridge to try and rip off as many explosives as they can before the Germans can ignite a secondary fuse to blow up the bridge.\n\nIn the aftermath of battle scenes like this, the human drama unfolds. Sgt. Angelo (Ben Gazzara, &quot;Fireball Forward&quot;) is a tough GI who loots the bodies of the dead and sees the war around him as a chance to get rich and take the wealth home when it&apos;s all over. But when he must shoot a Hitler Youth member who is sniping at his men, then weeps when he realizes he has shot a mere pre-teenage boy. During a lull in the siege on the bridge, Hartman faces off with Maj. Barnes (Bradford Dillman), who wants him to take his men onto the bridge and capture it despite enemy fire and the threat of the bridge&apos;s imminent destruction. Hartman argues that he cannot risk the lives of his men; Barnes states that it will help to end the war faster is the bridge is captured, thus saving more lives in the end. It&apos;s a tough choice to make, and both decisions have their drawbacks.\n\nThe performances are complimented by three crucial technical elements: scoring, scenery and cinematography. Elmer Bernstein provides a sweeping score which resounds with the troops when they are victorious, yet mourns and seems to cry during some heart-wrenching scenes, such as an important scene between Angelo, Hartman and Schmidt at the film&apos;s conclusion. The Czech locations look magnificent  the film looks and feels real because it was lensed in Europe, in a location which passes for Germany perfectly. The cobblestones streets, rustic villages, rolling hills and clear rivers look amazing. Finally, Stanley Cortez&apos;s cinematography is fantastic; the composition of every shot looks well-planned and detailed. There is action going on in the background and foreground most of the time. The focus is not just on the main characters, but as in real life, there is stuff going on around them. Scenes of the battle on the bridge are standouts, as the action is captured from every possible angle, it&apos;s very clear what&apos;s going on and who is where at all times.\n\n&quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; is a fine World War II film which succeeds in showing history, American patriotism and the horrors of war at the same time. It will leave you feeling glad that the Allies won the war and agonized over the great cost of such small gains. But when you realize how much a &quot;small&quot; gain really matters in the big picture, it won&apos;t seem as small anymore.",

      "reviewBody": "The easiest part to get of writer/director Alexander Payne&apos;s sci-fi comedy, Downsizing, is the allegory of shrinking ourselves and our possessions to miniature to save the planet from our excess yet become miniature plutocrats in the process. The more challenging part is to understand how he can pack climate change and economic decay also into his themes.\n\nPaul (Matt Damon), an occupational therapist who at best is just a nice guy, and his ambitious wife, Audrey (Kristen Wiig), decide to have a richer life by downsizing, but contrary to our conventional use of that term. To shrink means to have a bigger miniature mansion, the kind he couldn&apos;t afford in a regular size that his shrinking paycheck keeps him from. Of course, in his decision to help out the planet, he is really helping to mitigate his envy of his richer friends in their McMansions.\n\nPayne and co-writer Jim Taylor deftly move the Twilight-Zone story into a melodrama that stresses the humanity of a man who forsakes family and friends for a seemingly higher purpose such as saving the environment. However, it still comes back to greed.\n\nAt least until Paul experiences caring for those less fortunate than he, for those shrunk but still with relatively nothing, viz., the poor, the immigrant, and the sick to name a few disadvantaged souls living in a ghetto-tenement world far from the eyes of the advantaged. Once Paul witnesses real poverty he can never turn back to his truly shrunken life of excess and worthlessness.\n\nWhere Payne veers from the staples of his drama is bringing in an apocalyptic climate change, a danger not even appearing earlier. More than that misplaced motif is that he has nicely set up already the humanity that will save Paul, who must choose between survival and being together for however long with the ones he truly loves.\n\nDownsizing is rare, a comedy in sci-fi mode with a toolbox of social concerns. It&apos;s a child of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with a Twilight Zone spirit, and it&apos;s a pleasant holiday diversion."

Most of them have all of the facts wrong which leads me to believe they were on the phone instead of paying attention to the movie.\n\nYes, there is a talking skateboard. The skateboard is so cool! I have one just like it now. It talks and everything! I found it on ebay.\n\nI really have never seen such a funny, dramatic, and action packed film that was made with a low budget. There is even a love scene between the skateboard and Zack. It&apos;s kind of creepy the first time but it&apos;s really fun after you&apos;ve seen it.\n\nGo rent this movie! You will not regret it!",

Seeing Roberts sporting a short haircut, instead of his usual mane, is probably the most shocking element of the film. For Eric Roberts fans this might be tolerable entertainment, all others should steer clear. The conclusion especially is a real stretch, and what precedes it not much better. There is brief nudity, very little action, and a story that lacks momentum and credibility. For me, the best part was in the beginning with Roberts and Gedrick doing there &quot;shock jock&quot; routine, after that, it is a steady slide downhill. - MERK",

The movie&apos;s power comes from a level-headed and empathetic depiction of the pre-revolution conditions in Russia. Technologically Russia was a hundred years behind the western countries, with 65 million people living - in practical terms - in slavery.\n\nThe said conditions are rarely talked about, but they explain the desperate need for a change in the gigantic nation. It is a startling notion that even with the atrocities committed by The Party, Russians still had it better than before.\n\nThe Thorndikes use archival material to great effect in this well directed, still timely and intelligent film.",

Old school eh? I love this show. Coming off the back of the success of Grease, a real effort was made with high production values and new and interesting musical arrangements. Olivia&apos;s roster of guests is a roll call of the biggest stars of the time, and there is even the surprising appearance of a &apos;between Ike and Private Dancer&apos; Tina Turner! Olivia gets to show off her dancing skills with the legend that was Gene Kelly (the special was shown just before the release of Xanadau) and a couple of the best numbers (e.g. Olivia singing a medley that includes Cat Stevens &apos;Remmember the days of the old schoolyard&apos;) are simply not available elsewhere.

      "reviewBody": "Disturbing documentary that nonetheless raises a number of questions. My guess is that the film was produced for general circulation, to allay civilian fears of emotional trauma among returning vets. If so, that&apos;s certainly a laudable intent. For, as the documentary shows, many could be rehabilitated and returned to civilian life, despite the emotional wounds of war. In fact, the film conveys an optimistic tone throughout, as though eventual recovery is certain. That, plus the prologue assertion that no scene was staged, adds up to a generally reassuring note for anyone watching. After all, prospective employers need reassurance as well as family, while the last scene is as joyously uplifting as any Hollywood commercial contrivance.\n\nAs laudable as that intent is, I&apos;m still left wondering how representative the film is of what we would now term &quot;post-traumatic stress syndrome&quot;. For example, we know the scenes weren&apos;t staged, but we don&apos;t know how much editing went into the final cut. Nothing is said about editing in the prologue, and savvy viewers know how important editing is to creating desired effect. Then too, I&apos;m wondering whether there was pre-sorting of vets according to severity such that we only viewed the mildest, most remedial, cases. For example, the one session of hypnosis and regression appears a quick and easy cure. It&apos;s good that some cases are open to such efficient methods, but, again, how representative is this one case. Moreover, as another reviewer points out, nothing is said about possibility of relapse, even among the mild cases.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn&apos;t draw general conclusions about this terrible affliction from one documentary that may have been geared toward another purpose. The fact that the army withheld release for 30 years shows how wary they became to exposing the public to even this most optimistic rendering of the problem. Those early scenes of afflicted men are simply too wrenchingly real to be forgotten, and should serve as a reminder the next time our politicians start beating the now incessant drum of war. Perhaps that&apos;s why the film was withheld for so long."

      "reviewBody": "Decent intro for neophytes to the issues surrounding election integrity in the age of paperless electronic voting machines, especially if it motivates people to get more information on election integrity, or, better yet, to join an election integrity organization (search for &quot;election integrity&quot; on the web). Nice vignettes of interviews with Bev Harris, David Dill, and other experts. But the movie left me scratching my head at the end when it basically suggested that voting was enough to cure our problems with voting. This was particularly puzzling since the movie had shown a clip of activists Bev Harris and Andy Stephenson being told the same thing by an obviously apathetic assistant Secretary of State. Yes, vote -- but join an election integrity organization, demand commitment to election integrity from candidates, and serve as a poll worker or watcher. Was that judged too complicated for a sound bite?\n\nThe movie website indicates that it will be renamed &quot;Hacked,&quot; which is probably a better name. Hope there will be some editing and new material as well.\n\nFor a longer and more comprehensive film, see &quot;Invisible Ballots.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "While some DisneyNature documentaries are better than others, they are mostly very interesting and a common factor is that they are extremely well made. As well as having amazing animals. When it comes to the music and the narration (writing and delivery), those are the aspects where the quality has varied (mostly flawed). Saw 2012&apos;s &apos;Chimpanzee&apos; for DisneyNature documentary completest sake, as well as being a great fan of nature documentaries, Disney in general and the intimate approach to the storytelling.\n\nMy thoughts on &apos;Chimpanzee&apos; are very similar to those for 2014&apos;s &apos;Bears&apos; and 2019&apos;s &apos;Penguins&apos;. Except that it is marginally better than them. While they may look superior visually, &apos;Chimpanzee&apos; is a little more successful when it comes to the narration (although that aspect is not perfect here either), which does a little better at entertaining and educating. The strengths that those two had are exactly the same pretty much though in &apos;Chimpanzee&apos;.\n\n&apos;Chimpanzee&apos; succeeds a lot more than it doesn&apos;t, and has more good things than bad. The best of the good things fantastic. While not the most refined looking of the DisneyNature documentaries (namely the editing), &apos;Chimpanzee&apos; does wow visually. The scenery is stunning and captured colourfully on camera. The chimps also look wonderful and the way they are filmed is remarkably vivid. The music on the most part is fine, it fits well tonally and doesn&apos;t feel too overused or melodramatic. Did appreciate that some values and messaging were included, they were relatable ones and they were not laid on too thick.\n\nAbsolutely love the chimpanzees. Oscar is an adorable, very funny and rootable character, his mischievous antics were a joy to watch but it was also easy to relate to his struggles in survival. &apos;Chimpanzee&apos;, like &apos;Bears&apos;, does better than most DisneyNature documentaries on the educational aspect, where the information given was informative and illuminating. Also really loved the wide range of emotions shown by the animals, was touched by their journey and struggles, amused and charmed by their mischievous antics and inspired by how they deal with what they have to undergo. Also inspiring and honest was what was done with the values taught, which didn&apos;t come over as too preachy, and the tone doesn&apos;t feel muddled.\n\nBy all means, &apos;Chimpanzee&apos; isn&apos;t perfect. The music at times is intrusive and the editing at times is rushed looking and choppy.\n\nThe aspect that left me very conflicted was the narration, not uncommon with the DisneyNature documentaries as this was always the most variable aspect. It was entertaining and educational enough generally and Tim Allen delivers it amiably. It also doesn&apos;t spill out the animals&apos; emotions too much. However, for me there was at times too much juvenile humour, there could have been less of it (especially in the more dramatic moments) and can over-explain.\n\nOverall, good but not great. 7/10",

By the chosen way of storytelling and appearing as protagonist in his documentary, the director gave the thing a bad taste. It seemed more like an adventure-trip of a young German guy instead of showing the real story: young people fighting, hiding and living as rebels in a dangerous political and social environment. Maybe the director was just much too young and unexperienced for this kind of try. And maybe he felt hisself being on a guerillan warfare as he got so close to the young whiterussian activists. At least he seems to be supporting the right side and organizations.",

People do things you wouldn&apos;t expect, despite the slightly heavy-handed handling of emotions. There are areas where the movie is not perfect: it is so highly pessimistic and denounces the greed and selfishness of Egyptian men with so much vigor that it appears somewhat simplistic. It does tend to ramble a bit. But the power and the humor of the movie (it is quite funny, despite being tragic) transcends all that and makes those minor faults. I understand the director is very young, so he will have ample time to overcome and transcend these youthful imperfections. I didn&apos;t like Slumdog Millionaire because it told me everything about India that I already knew: it feels like a package tour where you are shown the sites you expect to see, and are whisked from one location to another. For a western viewer, Omaret yakobean is like a journey where you land at the airport and are immediately carried away by the atmosphere, the culture shock, the bustling streets, the misunderstandings, from which you emerge with challenged assumptions and a wider view of the world.",

All of this happens because the animals eat what appears to be hot marshmallow creme gurgling out of the earth.  The special effects are from what appears to be the caveman era, but it is still fun to watch.  Another movie that could almost work if remade with today&apos;s special effects (and a major script overhaul).",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; was a surprise when it was shown by TCM recently. This film brings together two talented men, Frank Capra and Bing Crosby. This light comedy, with some music, is seldom seen these days, and it&apos;s a shame. Although not one of the best films of the director, the film is entertaining and fun to watch.\n\nThe great achievement of Mr. Capra was the way he brought together a fabulous cast that work well together. Bing Crosby shows why he was one of the best performers of his time. He is always charming and generous to his fellow players. The other surprise in the film is Jane Wyman. Playing a light role she is delightfully playful as the woman who has found a rich man who wants to make her his wife, but she is still in love with the absent Pete Garvey, who just happens to reappear with two cute war orphans that immediately &quot;adopt&quot; her as their mother.\n\nThe other principals, Franchot Tone and Alexis Smith, are in terrific form. Ms. Smith, especially, is a delight to watch. It&apos;s a shame Hollywood didn&apos;t give her better vehicles in which to shine. Mr. Tone is suave as Wilbur Stanley, the millionaire who finds out in the worst way, his bride-to-be is in love with another man.\n\nAnother coup of Mr. Capra is the way he brings a lot of those excellent character actors that had worked with him in other films. Such is the case with Charles Lane, H.B. Warner, Charlest Halton, among others. There is a nice sequence that takes place in the plane that is bringing Pete back to America in which he sings a number with Phil Harris, Frank Fontaine, and Dorothy Lamour. Also in the early part of the film we saw a young and beautiful Anna Maria Alberghetti singing.\n\n&quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; shows why Frank Capra was one of the best directors, and it also helped that he had Bing Crosby on board.",

The original &quot;Cat People&quot; picture provides just the backdrop for this moving story about lonely people, both young and old.  There is a certain innocence and pathos that works very well alongside competent direction and acting.  Definitely not a horror film, this is a gentle fantasy and a very good one at that.",

He gets a good director and a dream cast of character actors to support him. And there&apos;s a line in the script to identify him as a Serb in case you need an explanation of his accent, but the line isn&apos;t necessary; his English is fine. \n\nStill, the burden is too much for Bekim. The film is a particularly dark Western. Writer/directory Kennedy, whose other films display a lot of warmth and humor, has given the star little to work with but grief and righteous resentment. You wish the hero well, but he doesn&apos;t engage you, and Bekim can&apos;t draw the missing sparkle forth from his own personality... not for an American audience, anyway.\n\nWe&apos;re left with a B movie, a movie that can command your attention but not your love."

      "reviewBody": "Alright, let&apos;s see. An intriguing and original story. An awesome leading lady. An absolutely chilling score. Shocking, intense, gruesome, gory, vile, and scary as all hell. Yeah, that basically covers everything. I&apos;ve finally found it. The Horror masterpiece of the decade. True Horror fans, I give you Sick Girl.\n\nIzzy, for the most part, is a fairly reasonable, dare I say nice person. Izzy lives with, and takes care of her 9 year old brother, Kevin, while her older brother serves in Iraq. All we ever learn about the parents is that they&apos;re gone. You could say Izzy has a lot on her plate, having to raise a sibling, and all. Not to mention Izzy misses her older brother a little too much, if you catch my drift. A lot of people go through life, having no idea what to do with their stress. With others, it simply comes natural, whether it be sex or drugs, or what have you. But with Izzy, she just up and realized one day that life would be so much more fulfilling if she could only kidnap, torture, torture, torture, rape, castrate, and kill whoever she wanted, whenever she wanted. So, anyway, that&apos;s what Izzy&apos;s been up to. Little bro, on the other hand, Kevin&apos;s got his own problems. The local bullies have been giving the little fella a hard time. If you think Izzy is above torturing and killing small children... well, she&apos;s not, which is all that needs to be said about that.\n\nI am in my late 20&apos;s, and I can honestly say that this is the first time a Horror movie has scared me since I was a little kid. Feeling that queasy, that shocked, and that impressed, all at once was not at all what I expected from a modern Horror movie. I just can&apos;t praise this dismal, graphic masterpiece enough. Besides being horrifying, original, and gory, another word also comes to mind. Interesting. As in, it&apos;s awfully interesting to observe how vulnerable someone who is already slightly disturbed, can be. All it could take is one disappointment, or tragedy, or even a bad day, for one to suddenly cross that line from &quot;slightly disturbed&quot; to &quot;ferocious killing machine&quot;, with seemingly no chance of return. It happens. Even to big sisters. Comparing this pitch-black diamond to pseudo-indy garbage like High Tension or Hostel, would be insulting. If anything, Sick Girl should only be compared to the elite, such as Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer, or Maniac. Sick Girl is a morbid little beauty, just waiting to be discovered, hopefully by someone who can appreciate real Horror when they see it. Lastly, I am totally counting on more from the refreshingly disturbing Leslie Andrews, who is ultimately what made this movie work so well. Now, that&apos;s what I call a scream queen!!",

Robert Donat as Dr. Manson, a highly-principled physician who struggles with the conflicting demands of his profession, provides an uneven central performance.  It is sometimes hard to understand his motivations and this is the film&apos;s biggest weakness. Rosalind Russell does a fine job as his ever-faithful, often suffering wife. Her performance is perfect, and does provide a moral core to the film. The film wisely avoids a lot of details of the novel that would have muddied up the storyline.  (In the book, Dr. Manson has an affair with one of society patients.)  The film also boasts some fine performances from a very young Rex Harrison and Ralph Richardson.  In fact, Richardson&apos;s role as an idealistic, though flawed doctor steals the spotlight every time he is on the screen.  The film also has a great look, especially the outdoor scenes of the British villages.",

      "reviewBody": "Very enjoyable, cleverly written and well-paced operetta-kitsch nonsense. Directed by Franz Antel, of whom I am never too kind, with a steadier and more capable hand than usual, but what would have been the result if a real good director would have directed the material? Still, the story quickly moves on, the situations change rapid to keep the interest, sentimentality is kept in check (though we could have done without it in the last 10 minutes), the script has a load of well-thought out (verbal and visual) funny ideas and there are a couple of catchy ditties. Nice cinematography and colours, beautiful dresses.\n\nThe viewer has to endure Rudolf Prack who walks about as if he does not really understand that this is a comedy (but maybe his uniform was too tight), but this is compensated by the rest of the cast who has great fun. Hannelore Bollmann is beautiful, Rolf Olsen at moments is a bit over the top but still very funny, Jane Tilden is a fine type cast as the extravagant countess (that voice!), to name but a few. And of course there is Hans Moser who is in great form here and has the one hilarious moment after the other; his handling of a telephone conversation with Vienna (Rolf Olsen on the line) had me roaring with laughter with tears in my eyes.\n\n In short: despite the drawbacks, the viewer also should have a ball."

This is just &quot;Anchorman&quot;, &quot;Ricky Bobby&quot;, &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;, or what have you, except in basketball.

      "reviewBody": "Last year&apos;s &quot;Kill List&quot; was one of the creepiest, most disturbing films I had seen in a long time. It&apos;s a film that stayed with me long after the screening, and one I encouraged friends and associates to check out. Some still haven&apos;t forgiven me.\n\nImagine the combination of dread/anticipation I felt about the chance to see director Ben Wheatley&apos;s latest slice of darkness entitled &quot;Sightseers&quot;. Described by some as a &quot;dark comedy&quot;, I would say that the only thing possibly darker than Wheatley&apos;s sense of humor would be the center of a black hole.\n\n&quot;Sightseers&quot; tells the story of a frumpy British couple off on &apos;holiday&apos; (as they say,) the problems that come up on such trips, and the unique way they choose to solve them. Saying any more would give too much away. Suffice it to say, may you NEVER come across a couple like this on your vacation.\n\nIs it funny? Yes, it is. But you may hate yourself for laughing. Is it violent? For sure. Exceptionally. But in the context of the story, it has to be. Is it disturbing? Oh, yes it is, but once again Wheatley has made a film that once you&apos;ve started it, you&apos;ll find it difficult to turn away. And, like &quot;Kill List&quot;, the ending packs a wallop from which it may take you a while to recover.\n\nFilms like &quot;Sightseers&quot; are tough to categorize, and even tougher to recommend. This is not the feel-good hit of the summer. It is a look into the blackest parts of human nature, and how that blackness is often camouflaged by the banality of everyday existence. I wouldn&apos;t call Wheatley&apos;s films &quot;entertaining&quot;, but damned if they don&apos;t get an emotional response out of me. So seek it out but you have been warned.\n\nwww.worstshowontheweb.com",

I LOVE Goldie Hawn!!! She&apos;s one of those actresses that I really believe is as adorable in real life as she is in movies. Goldies free spirited character and Susan Sarandon&apos;s up tight character played off each other so well. Jeffrey Rush was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! Who knew he was so funny!!!!!!! I&apos;d love to see him in more comedic rolls in the future. Run, don&apos;t walk to your nearest video store and rent this one tonight!!!!!!!!!!"

      "name": "Regular and routine Paco Martinez Soria comedy , this time set in Mexico city and Acapulco",
      "reviewBody": "Funny and fun Paco Martinez Soria vehicle with great entertainment and amusement enough . It is an agreeable picture concerning the silly adventures of an unfortunate as well as botcher sixty-and-some-year-old man going to visit his son in Mexico , but things get worse . As Ramón (Paco Martínez Soria) is fed up with his wife Socorro (Florinda Chico) wanting to see him dressed up and forbidding him food for his health . When he leaves Madrid and arrives in Mexico to attend the wedding of his son Carlos (Fernando Luján), Ramón takes advantage of the country&apos;s legislation to ask his wife for a divorce. Paco Martínez Soria believes himself to be a very happy veteran with his new divorce . Once there , he only encounters a bustling Mexican city and he has a lot of problem . When he notices that he is not very good at flirting with young girls and that his wife&apos;s advice was not entirely misguided , he becomes frustrated in his new condition.\n\nAmusing Spanish comedy with the great Paco Martínez Soria who steals the show with his Aragonese accent , and playing splendidly his usual role as a fast-talking , grumpy as well as sympathetic old man . This diverting movie deals with a recently divorced man , unhappy in his previous marriage , he attempts to encounter new opportunities and a better life , but things go awry , because he goes on loving his wife , Florinda Chico . In this family comedy is often used the ordinary formula about ¨Fish out water¨ , as the film is made to entertain , and this movie , especially for a good time and a pleasant entertainment and is also pretty darn funny . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylishly enjoyable . There are some nice jokes in the film and the cast , playing eccentric characters , make a cosy fit . The flick interweaves fun comedy along with a social criticism about the Mexican social habits . Based on a play from the 1930s written by Pedro Muñoz Seca and Pedro Pérez Fernández (&quot;Anacleto Se Divorcia&quot;), this film creates its comic gags with an outdated anti-divorce orientation . This movie packs customary images of the social life from the Seventies with nutty situations , but it especially contains catching touches of humor , tongue-in-cheek and irony ; adding the typical Mexican and Spanish idiosyncrasy . At the same time it shows a large sightseeing , taking place a tourist tour of he populous capital, Mexico D. F. , or the touristy Acapulco , in which there is no lack of the habitual images of diving in La Quebrada .It includes an atmospheric and functional cinematography by Fernando Colín . And an evocative and catching musical score by Antón García Abril , with soundtrack typical of the sixties and early seventies , adding some Mexican songs . Only for fans of Martínez Soria that may enjoy it.\n\n¨El alegre divorciado(1976)¨ was a Spanish/Mexico co-production and regular but professionally directed by Pedro Lazaga. Lazaga directed various film with the popular comic player Paco Martinez Soria . Pedro was born in Valls , Tarragona , Catalonia , and died on November 30, 1979 in Madrid . He was a prolific director and writer , specially known for Los Chicos del Preu (1967), María Morena (1951), Cuerda De Presos (1956) and Posición Avanzada (1966). Pedro was a craftsman , a notorious director and writer who directed all kind of genres such as Peplum : Siete Espartanos , Wartime : Cuerda De Presos , Posicion Avanzada , Torrepartida , La Patrulla ; Drama : Rostro De Asesino , Otro Arbol De Guernica , but especially known for comedies in low budget . Director Pedro Lazaga made , during the fifties and early sixties , eight films , mostly comedies : ¨Muchachas De Azul¨, Ana Dice Si¨. ¨Luna De Verano¨, ¨Económicamente Debiles¨ , ¨Trio Damas¨ for screenwriter and producer Jose Luis Dibildos and his ¨Agata Films Productions¨. The best of all them resulted to be ¨Los Tramposos¨. He continued making comedies such as Patrulla De Los Once , Los Tramposos , Sabian Demasiado , El Vikingo , ¡No Firmes Más Letras, Cielo! , Vente a Ligar Al Oeste , Hasta El Matrimonio Nos Separe , La Amante Perfecta , Fulanita y Sus Menganos , Vota a Gundisalvo , Terapia Al Desnudo , Tres Suecas Para Tres Rodríguez , Yo soy Fulana de Tal , 5 Almohadas Para Una Noche , En La Cresta De la Ola and several others . His most known films were with the popular comic player Paco Martinez Soria , such as : Abuelo Made in Spain , Padre De La Criatura , Alegre Divorciado , Estoy Hecho Un Chaval , Vaya Par Gemelos , among others . Rating : 4.5/10 it&apos;s a pretty weak comedy, inferior than other Paco Martinez Soria movies.",

How they deduced that Laura will be at Martin&apos;s house is beyond me.\n\nMartin&apos;s doors were all open. Now who keeps their doors open man. At least not here in my beloved country India.\n\nOur lead guy (Eric) gets his face spit upon by a suspect and without washing his face he consumes coffee n then later has sex with Laura (a lousy one though). Hope he washed his face before kissing her.",

The gore effects are pretty good, there&apos;s a lot of filming on location on an island, on the streets of London. That&apos;s always a nice deviation from the annoying in-studio filming. I have no problem with the acting. Fiona in particular does a great job, considering the outrageous things she&apos;s asked to do. She&apos;s cute and seems like a fun girl who&apos;s up for anything. Most importantly, the script is excellent. You&apos;ll see things here that you&apos;ll never see in an American movie and it&apos;s quite creepy and there are a lot of surprises. But it&apos;s not perverse or mean-spirited. In fact, there could have been more nudity. If you&apos;re looking for something different than the typical sanitized PG-13 horror, or orgies of fake-blood, this is a movie worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "As many viewers I saw &quot;Always&quot;, actually several times, before I even learned about &quot;A Guy Named Joe.&quot; It is factual that the later film was a remake of the earlier one, but being in more modern times a significant story difference was depicted. I have no reason to compare the two against each other, for each one is a fine film on its own. \n\nSet in WW II England, &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; gets its title from a comment made by one of the British children waiting to talk to Pete after one of his bombing runs over Germany. He told one of the other children, &quot;that&apos;s what all American soldiers are called, guys named Joe.&quot; There was no actual character named Joe in the film. \n\nI had never seen Spencer Tracy in his prime, and he was quite a handsome actor. Now I understand why he was so popular. He plays Pete, the pilot who takes unapproved chances to get difficult jobs done. In &quot;Always&quot;, Dryfuss as Pete does the same for putting out forest fires. In both films Pete dies during a heroic mission and in heaven is sent to help a novice pilot, who ends up romancing his old girlfriend, Drinda. \n\nI understand that at least one viewer who was in WW II thinks this is not a very good or realistic film. Maybe not, but it is still entertaining, and for me interesting to see a film made the year before I was born. Worth seeking out, for anyone who also enjoyed &quot;Always&quot; to see where it came from. Two different films from two different times, both excellent."

      "reviewBody": "The word &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; has in cinematographic Germany of today not such a good reputation. But that is the kind of entertainment the people in Germany needed after the traumatic WW II. That Genre was totally produced for the taste of the masses and served well for this. It is a similar speciality of German cinematography like the Karl May films (Winnetou and friends) and the Edgar Wallace films of the sixties. Nothing that can be very interesting for Non-Germans, neither could be understood by other people so well. You should notice that Germans in the fifties were not politically interested. They just wanted &quot;Heimat&quot;, a manageable scope for daily life. Mostly the &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; plays in the mountain areas, where You could not see the damage the war brought to the German cities, the place as well where a short trip for holidays was possible for the people. If You went for holidays, You went to the Sea or to the Mountains. It is the same today. The Heimatfilm and the Bergfilm&quot;, which is another speciality of the German cinematography (films featuring mountain stories), are closely related, the first comes from the latter. That started already in the twenties. Even Luis Trenker was a German filmmaker, because the people of South Tirol did not regard themselves as Italians ( and still don&apos;t). German film-making has not been a successful story in the last 30 years, but in the fifties with the Heimatfilm&quot; and in the sixties it was nation wide, the fifties being a time with no TV! You could also grasp the meaning of these movies for the German audience when You compare them with the Bollywood movies. The Indian audience is also not interested in politics, they just want to escape into a hail world for a few hours. There are no more &quot;Heimatfilme&quot; for the cinema any longer, but there were always TV-series about the same Genre. What the &quot;western&quot; is for the US citizen is the &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; for the Germans. This is something for depth psychology. The Germans seem to have a strong inclination for having a nice time in a natural surrounding (natural but under control) where they can dedicate themselves to their &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; and cultivate their longing for peace and harmony (which should not be interrupted again). So far it is not alarming that violence-films are not produced in this country. Unfortunately they are shown on TV, made in the USA. The elder people look the harmless &quot;Heimatfilm&quot;, the younger look violence- and action-films. A new generation of violent-prepared Germans is brought up, with the help of US movie and TV productions.",

      "reviewBody": "Peckinpah has a rep and this is the film which provided most of it. I had the privilege of actually seeing this on the big screen once, in the late seventies. As the beginning credits end, Pike (Holden) tells his bunch &quot;If they move, Kill &apos;em!&quot; Then Peckinpah&apos;s credit appears. A woman seated behind me gasped, whispering &quot;oh, no...&quot; Oh, my. It sounded like the lady didn&apos;t know she&apos;d wandered into a Peckinpah film and she knew what she was in for. When you enter Peckinpah-land, you need to be prepared. There are no punches pulled, no sidestepping the unpleasant aspects of life. Peckinpah&apos;s characters are tough men; I mean, really tough, not phony-Hollywood tough. In this case, they are coarsened by what seems to be years on the trail, blasted by the sun, snapped at by rattlesnakes, and harassed by bandits. And at this point, they&apos;ve pretty much had it.\n\nNot that they&apos;re complaining, mind you. They&apos;ve lived their lives how they saw fit, this bunch, and they make no apologies for any of it. I believe the actual year is around 1913, just before World War I begins. Most of the action takes place in Mexico, where the Bunch becomes involved with a local general (Fernandez) with the usual delusions of grandeur. If you go by the name of the character Angel, the general can be viewed as a version of the devil. That would make the Bunch avenging angels at the end. But heroes? No, not at all. They have their own code, they know instinctively they&apos;re stronger together than on each own, but they reason this concept out also - Peckinpah wants to make sure it&apos;s clear these are not unthinking savages. They&apos;re just men, who&apos;ve reached a point in history where they must make a crucial turn. History, it seems, has no real use for them anymore. It&apos;s quite simple - they either fade slowly or go out quickly. In a film such as this, with its now insurmountable rep, you tend to wait for those big set pieces, especially the climactic battle. Wait for it, wait for it... here it is. Bam! - you&apos;re in Peckinpah territory. You&apos;re a part of history.",

      "reviewBody": "They certainly don&apos;t make movies like this anymore. Likable characters, good story, a very charismatic Burt Reynolds. As for the action, I would take well-filmed, exciting car chase and action sequences as seen in White Lightning over CGI special effects in today&apos;s films any day! Rural locations in the South are also used to great effect. You can almost feel the cold water of the swamp in a great opening sequence, the ears of corn bouncing off the windshield as Reynolds drives the souped-up Ford through a cornfield, and the dust coming off the tires. As also observed by movie critic Roger Ebert, today&apos;s special effects- laden movies have forgotten how to make the location of the story, the land, a character in itself. After seeing this film at a drive-in theater around 1975, White Lighting was a &quot;bad influence&quot; on a kid as I was in rural Wisconsin who had just gotten his driving license. I would discreetly take the parent&apos;s car and my friends out on dusty, dirt roads in the countryside to execute &quot;some Burt Reynolds style&quot; driving. In addition, some parts of the movie are even touching. These include when Reynolds meets his parents for the first time after spending time in prison. And when Reynolds prior to the big chase sequence at the end proclaims his confusion to a young woman at the &quot;Home For Young Mothers&quot; as to why his brother who tried to make something of himself was murdered while he &quot;had not done a damn good thing&quot; his entire life. Enough of my ramblings. In summary, a movie with a number of added dimensions to put it far above and beyond a standard action movie. A pure classic.",

      "reviewBody": "I think most people who follow American politics would agree that the Clinton administration was not hawkish. Many of his opponents criticized him for this, while many supporters applauded him  especially as he drastically reduced defense spending shortly after taking office in 1993. There is not a lot of controversy there, and whether you supported this or not, it was intelligible to a certain degree, since a US territory had not been attacked since WWII. Many Americans did not see a threat, and most were caught off-guard on 9/11.\n\nTherefore, by depicting the Clinton Administration&apos;s political cautiousness to not go on the offensive without precedence, especially during a scandal, and later a heated election between Gore and Bush, was not a political attack on Clinton, but a fair assessment of what was happening in Washington at the time. Clinton may have been weak on national security, and fearful of creating turmoil in the Middle East, but he certainly would have been criticized from the right by putting boots on the ground while campaigning for Gore. This was even acknowledged in the movie.\n\nAs far as the dialog, I&apos;m not sure if anyone involved with this movie had any first or second-hand knowledge of comments made by Secretary Albright or George Tenet; or if Barbara Bodine was really that nasty. However, I think the general description of where the main players stood was generally accurate, and is supported by the 9/11 report and what facts are known.\n\nOverall, I think this was a great movie, and if anything, I hope people realize that the real enemies are the terrorists, who are still a threat, and will attack if left alone."

Happily,Unfaithful rests more toward the upper end of the spectrum;based on a 1969 French film by Claude Chabrol(La Femme Infidele),the movie sports a continental demeanor that seems wholly appreciate,but as a whole we have seen this kind of adulterated behavior several times before. Diane Lane&apos;s standout performance is what elevates the first half,which could be easily dismissed as a straight-to-cable soaper or straight-to-video softcore porno assembly. A well to do housewife seemingly content with her husband(Richard Gere,is one of his best works here and one of his finest performances since the latter part of the 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s),her son (Erik Per Sullivan),and her home in a quaint New York(upscale Manhattan) suburb,unexpectedly enters into a torrid affair with a French book dealer(Oliver Martinez-who looks like something out of grocery store paperback novel and one of those daytime TV soap hunks). Lane&apos;s complex portrayal of a woman caught between the borders of reason and risk is simply smashing,yet eventually she&apos;s not required to carry the picture by herself,as the second half heads off in some interesting and unexpected directions that ultimately lead to the wonderful amibiguous final shot. Unfaithful works for viewers willing to put some thought into it that only works for those who want cheap thrills will probably be disappointed,but in all its a illusion of eternal bliss that will find this easily a satisfying picture."

This comical Herbie story concerns about Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) who is an ambitious property developer who has bought lots of blocks of land in the Downstreet district in order to build a shopping mall and apartments . There is one obstacle however ; an old woman , firefighter&apos;s widow named Steinmetz ( Helen Hayes) who won&apos;t sell the one remaining lot that Hawk needs to carry out with his gigantic plot . So Hawk resorts to all manner of traps , legal or otherwise, to get it. Fortunately, the elderly widow Steinmetz has an ace under her sleeve in the form of Herbie , the fantastic car which she receives from her niece , as she takes a magical Wolkswagen Bug named Herbie with a mind of its own . Miraculous Herbie takes her for a ride and stumbles into Hawk&apos;s evil hoodlums who pursue through skyscrapers , bridges and buildings . As always, Herbie the love bug , is helping the young couple (Ken Barry , Stefanie Powers) find romance but encountering all sorts of hilarious obstacles along the way . Meanwhile Herbie with the number 53 dreams that intervenes in the biggest race cars located in Daytona to compete in the Grand Prize , a challenge among top competitors circle the world&apos;s most famous racing circuits and quickly slipping in the ranking.\n\nThis ordinary Disney slapdash film displays great loads of amusement , fun , giggles , race cars and is pretty entertaining . It&apos;s an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who like cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps by Herbie . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Ken Berry and Stephanie Powers play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited owner Keenan Wynn , as excessive villain , is top notch . Colorful cinematography and jolly soundtrack including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie&apos;s series. This is a delightful film , the original film turns out to be : ¨The love bug¨ (1969) by Robert Stevenson , followed by ¨ Herbie rides again , Herbie goes to Montecarlo , Herbie goes bananas ¨ among others and a 1997-for-television-movie and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This &quot; Herbie rides again ¨versi on is amusing and with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture is correctly directed by Robert Stevenson .Worthwhile seeing , it&apos;s a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . It&apos; one of the best and funniest of ¨Herbie¨ series .",

I can still remember a long time ago on Sundays watching Wrestling at the Chase with Larry Madisick (The ringside announcer). Then, it was Crusher Blackewell, The Von-Eriks, and other various names that seem to have long been forgotten. Now, it&apos;s Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and women wrestlers like Chyna.\n\n     It was amazing to see the transformation from what it was into what it is. It was also sad to see the self destruction of Jake the Snake Roberts and to a certain point Terry Funk with his refusal to retire.\n\n      What was also interesting was the fact that the heads of the wrestling groups (like Vince McMahon)the movie did profile did not make light of what they did or even how they promoted it. This is sports entertainment plain and simple. They have tapped into a market not to be out done by any other mass marketed item except for PokeMon.\n\n      The only problem I had with this film was the fact that I did see it at the movie theater. Now after the fact, I believe that a documentary like this should have gone to video instead. It didn&apos;t diminish the quality of the subject, but it was just something not meant for the big screen.\n\n      None the less I did enjoy this film and I would recommend it for just about anyone who has the slightest interest in wrestling.",

If you have a free afternoon, watching this on cable might be OK, but don&apos;t waste your money purchasing this. \n\nIf someone who has seen this could explain the final scene with Alex and his final doctor, Olivia Hussey, I would love to hear it.

But this picture was so spectacular in all respects that I was taken aback by its sheer accomplishment. Critic Kenneth Tynan said that one must &apos;suspend one&apos;s disbelief&apos; to take part in the movie experience. If that is the case, this picture became real; it was not a play on the screen performed by mere actors.\n\nThe story is familiar but the production is not. Direction is skillful and the photography is perfect. The picture moves quickly and the acting is superb. Francis Lederer was good, Brigitte Helm was even better, and Warwick Ward, who plays Col. Beranoff, spit and polish and bent on revenge, was outstanding. He was the glue that held the cast together and was a riveting presence whenever he was on screen.\n\nI could go on and on, but enough. I am rearranging my own top 10 films to include this one. I caught it at the Capitolfest in Rome, N.Y.,8/09, in 35MM. That is the way it should be seen, as a small screen would diminish this picture in more ways than one.\n\nAnd I don&apos;t like Soaps."

      "reviewBody": "Well, &apos;Down With Love&apos; turned out to be a unexpectedly pleasant surprise. Love many of the late 50s and 60s sex romantic comedies, &apos;Pillow Talk&apos; being a primary example, and can&apos;t get enough of those with Doris Day and Rock Hudson which this film clearly was paying homage to. There was the worry though as to whether &apos;Down With Love&apos; would be just another heavily predictable film with forced comedy moments, no romantic chemistry and no charm with talented casts wasted.\n\nLuckily, &apos;Down With Love&apos; on the most part was not one of those films. It is a satire and celebration of the sex romantic comedies from the late 50s and in particular the 60s, being set in 1962, and mostly does a really good job, capturing the fun, kitsch, charm, froth and affectionate nostalgia of the period and the films with incredibly impressive results. Is it as good as the films it&apos;s satirising and celebrating? No. Are the two leads and their chemistry on the same level as Day and Hudson or even Day and James Garner? Not in a million years, but this is a tall order with not many actors and actresses today having the same amount of appeal and that special one of a kind chemistry that those stars had.\n\n&apos;Down With Love&apos; is not perfect. It is easy to dismiss the story as being slight and predictable, and it is. One does have to bear in mind though that the story was not exactly the strong suit in the sex romantic comedies of the late 50s and 60s, it was the production values, the stars, the supporting cast, the writing (on the most part) and the chemistry between the stars that elevated those films to a greater level.\n\nMostly the script is fine, but it is not without its clunkers. Especially that homosexual accusation, that was cringe-worthy, completely out of place and if it was made in either of the decades that are being satirised and celebrated it would have been anachronistic and would have been anachronistic in its 1962 setting. A few of the more twisty moments were too obvious and didn&apos;t serve much point and it occasionally affected the pacing. It was nice to see Tony Randall again, but he really deserved much better than a pointless cameo that gave him nothing to do, he might as well have not been in the film at all.\n\nHowever, &apos;Down With Love&apos; looks great and replicates the look of the late 50s and 60s perfectly, the glorious Technicolor, the super stylish photography, the colourful sets, the kitschy décor, sumptuous costuming, the CinemaScope logo. The split screen was clever in one scene. There are artificial painted backdrops and cheap back projection, but this was perfect and appropriate considering what the film is doing. The soundtrack is infectious and affectionate and the direction is controlled and super slick.\n\nApart from the odd clunker, the script is clever and witty while also being endearingly frothy. The characters lack depth but are not too shallow or annoying thanks to the charm of the cast. The story isn&apos;t perfect, but is mainly fun, charming and captures the spirit of the period and films it&apos;s satirising and celebrating perfectly and with clear affection.\n\nRenee Zellwegger gives a sprightly and likable lead performance and is well matched by a charming, understated and carefree Ewan McGregor in the other lead role. Their chemistry is nicely done, to me it was there but subtle. It may not have been Day and Hudson but that is incredibly daunting for anybody since to replicate. David Hyde Pierce steals the film, looking like he is having the most fun, he certainly has the most energy. Sarah Poulson is amusingly wise-cracking and charming, if occasionally a little too tongue-in-cheek.\n\nOverall, an unexpected pleasant surprise if not perfect. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re a fan of Gamera from &apos;90s trilogy, Gamera vs. Barugon may be the original Gamera movie for you.\n\nThe movie begins with Gamera&apos;s being freed from the rocket he was trapped in at the end of Gamera, the Gigantic Monster and returning to Earth to wreak havoc on a dam. He then disappears for a good 45 minutes while the movie follows a trio of treasure hunters to a tropical island on their quest to retrieve an opal the brother of one of the hunters hid in a cave during the Second World War. Not to give away too much, but the procurement of this opal leads to the emergence of Barugon, in the middle of Japan, who Gamera (eventually) fights in typical Gamera fashion.\n\nThree things immediately stand out about the second entry in the Gamera series:\n\n There are no kids in this movie. As in its predecessor, Gamera is apparently motivated purely by a quest for energy sources. \n\n Gamera is barely in the movie. He opens the movie, returns to fight Barugon, then comes back after another long absence to fight Barugon again. The bulk of the movie deals with the birth of Barugon and the Japanese&apos;s attempts to defeat him. (Maybe this was the genesis of the military&apos;s conflict in Gamera: The Revenge of Iris over which monster to attack first.) \n\n Finally, the movie is in color, and Daiei seems eager to exploit that fact. The opening titles are played out over shapeless colors, and one of Barugon&apos;s weapons is a rainbow beam emanating from his back.\n\nThe movie contains some silly moments (most notably the theft of the diamond), but the human conflicts and relationships are played surprisingly straight and adult, at least in comparison to those in a typical Godzilla movie; everyone doesn&apos;t necessarily agree on strategy, and it&apos;s probably safe to say the two leads don&apos;t view each other as siblings. The biggest problem with the movie is its odd pacing, but without a delusional kid and several characters who do virtually nothing running around, Gamera vs. Barugon is a decided improvement over the original.",

      "reviewBody": "Bruce Lee was perhaps the world greatest Martial Artist. His many films prove to his audience that he was indeed that. As for being a writer, there is much to be desired. This is one of Bruce Lee&apos;s written works and called &quot; The Circle of Iron. &quot; It was originally conceived to be a teaching tool for the young student. In this offering, David Carradine plays, The Blind Man / Monkeyman / Death / Changsha all of who are guides and teachers to Cord the student (Jeff Cooper.) Cord&apos;s task is to find and defeat Zetan (Christopher Lee). Roddy McDowall and Eli Wallach round out the cast and provide philosophical statements for Cord. This film itself is a hodgepodge of information and Zen philosophy, designed to instruct those who seek to learn the Path or DOW. For audiences seeking lots of excitement and physical Martial arts confrontation, this movie is somewhat of a disappointment. Still there is enough to keep the student from wondering off till the lesson is learned. ***",

      "reviewBody": "In late 1965/early 1966,a band from Austin,Texas,named The 13th Floor Elevators exploded out of the garage &amp; made a name for themselves in that era of rock &amp; roll. The Elevators were said to coin the phrase, &quot;Psychedelic Rock&quot;. One of the band members was Roger Keynard Erikson,coined &quot;Roky&quot; by his friends &amp; fans. Roky,in the spirit of the times,experimented with various drugs (Marijuana,LSD,Heroin,etc.). After an arrest (that was obviously set up by the Texas feds)for possessing less than an ounce of Marijuana,his lawyer sought out an insanity plea &amp; spent four years in a state psychiatric hospital,where he was diagnosed schizophrenic,emerged four years later &amp; returned to music,but with a much darker edge,until he retired from music in 1987 and became a recluse. This well documented film manages to shed light on a troubled soul that was yanked from the limelight way too soon. Candid interviews with several of those who either knew him closely (his brothers &amp; mother),as well as celebrities,such as fellow Texans, Billy Gibbons (Z.Z.Top),Gibby Haynes (The Butthole Surfers),Byron Coley (former editor of Forced Exposure),and a bevy of others. And then of course,the music (rare early film clips of The 13th Floor Elevators on American Bandstand,playing the film&apos;s title song,&apos;You&apos;re Gonna Miss Me,as well as other performance footage,including the last time he was seen in public at a concert where he stood there,doing nothing,and if that wasn&apos;t enough,some rarely seen home movie footage of Roky,and the rest of his family). A sad,but insightful film. Not rated by the MPAA,this film serves up a few rude words,as well as spoken testimony of the horrors of Roky&apos;s four nightmare years in a mental institution,and descriptions of some of the more sordid aspects of the 1960&apos;s hippie counter culture (drugs,sexual experimentation,etc.)",

Bring on the fantasy scenes, please.\n\nIt also badly needed a choreographer, but it had nice music here and there. \n\nNot the best romantic movie of the year.\n\n(Originally written 2/13/1999)",

It is sad that this little film hasn&apos;t been better preserved, since it is a fine example of lower budget film making from the thirties. Film features tons of depression era atmosphere (fancy dress parties, overdressed socialites) and pleasant performances by two fairly well known character actors (Herbert Mundin and Paul Cavanaugh, who portrays a slick gambler cum gigolo with a heart of gold). One major flaw here: the storyline overall is a bit thin to make for a really engrossing crime drama. Still, it is a pleasant diversion and and time capsule-like glimpse into another era. Six out of ten.",

It keeps the core elements of the 40&apos;s film, but adapts it to a distopic sci-fi action futuristic movie. Pamela Anderson plays Barb, a role similar to Bogart&apos;s Rick. The gender of the love affair from the past and of the third part of the love triangle have also been changed. The fictional town of Steel Harbor in the United States replaces Casablanca and the story is held during a futuristic Second Civil War rather than in the beginning of World War II. Both protagonists own a bar/nightclub, but Barb Wire is also a bounty huntress. As this remake is a sci-fi film, special contact lenses that cheat retinal scans substitute the letters of transit kept with Rick. As predictable, acting is worse in this remake, which has much more action. Off course &quot;Casablanca&quot; is much better, but surprisingly &quot;Barb Wire&quot; is not bad, in spite of the bad critics it has received.",

      "reviewBody": "A new maid is hired to do random chores around a residence in the Philippines. She is not familiar with the local customs, and learns that she has begun working during the month reserved for dead spirits to be honored. Innocently disturbing one of the ghosts, she begins to learn of a terrifying secret.\n\nThe cover of this movie compared it to &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;The Grudge&quot;, which I think does this film a terrible disservice. Yes, there are aspects of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (seeing ghosts) and I can understand the &quot;Grudge&quot; similarities, to a point. But I don&apos;t think a viewer should think of this movie in terms of these other films because there is something unique here that really allows it to stand out from other Asian horror films.\n\nThe lead character is interesting because she is both trying to solve a mystery and is herself a mystery: what does the ghost want from her? But also, why has she been summoned to be the maid for this new family (if you&apos;re like me, you&apos;ll quickly discover she never has to clean anything or watch any children). They&apos;re both interesting questions, and I think the viewer will like how they play out -- hints are dropped along the way, but I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll catch them all on the first watch.\n\nWhat might be a drawback for the film is the use of loud noises to startle the audience (doors creaking and such) and a few times where a ghost jumps into the frame completely unexpectedly. In some ways this was a cheap trick to get a scare out of the audience, but as someone who doesn&apos;t scare easily (I&apos;ve seen more horror films already this year than you&apos;ll probably ever see in your life) I have to admit I was a bit jumpy and had to grip the blanket a little tighter.\n\nA strength of the film was the creator&apos;s obvious awareness that Americans (and other non-Filipinos) would be watching this. The religious observances are explained in a way that is understandable but doesn&apos;t treat the viewer like a child or an idiot. I have no idea if the holiday observed here is real, but even if it&apos;s not I was convinced. The culture is very well captured.\n\nGive this one a chance -- I found it to be so much more than I expected. After I was starting to think all Asian horror followed such similar patterns (which is not to say American horror doesn&apos;t), this was so refreshing. Solid plot, great characters... and a puzzle piece ending that will leave you feeling this one comes complete.",

      "reviewBody": "Beyond and Back is one of the few movies that impacted me for years to come. I saw it with my mother back in 1978 or 1979 at a local theater. Since that time I have had an enormous desire to see it again. Unfortunately the producer of the film, Sunn Classic Pictures Inc. became defunct shortly after several of its top managers left to the expanding Tri-Star Pictures. Recently however, several of the original management members reacquired Sunn Classic Pictures Inc. and are in the process of redeveloping the company so there is a possibility that this movie will return on VHS or DVD. I recently contacted Sunn Classic Pictures Inc. to try and find out if the possibility is a real one.\n\nIt was only 14 years old the last time I saw this movie almost 25 years ago, but as I mentioned it made a bigger impact on my than any other movie I have ever seen, even to the point of encouraging me to try and obtain a copy now as an adult.\n\nThe movie as others have mentioned in their reviews was somewhat of a documentary with interviews of people who claimed to have died and then come back from the dead. The movie took the stories and then reproduced them into visual representations of what occurred and how the experience would have been observed from a first hand perspective.\n\nOne scene I can still recall is of a younger man who had died in the hospital and then while dead left his body thinking he was alive and o.k. only to look back and see his body dead on his hospital bed. After walking around the hospital out of his body he eventually ends up returning to his body at which point life returns to his body.\n\nSome reviewers have said the movie is to long. Personally I don&apos;t recall the overall length of the film, I only that in many ways this movie helped reaffirm my beliefs in life after death regardless of whether one ultimately ends up in heaven or hell. \n\nThis movie primarily tries to take you on a journey with the question of whether life ultimately ends when the physical body dies. Those who have seen this movie or may see this movie in the future and who enjoy it may also be interested in the books by Mary K. Baxter called an &quot;A Divine Revelation of Hell&quot;, &quot;A Divine Revelation of Heaven&quot;, or &quot;A Divine Revelation of the Spirit Realm&quot;."

Encountering art is a matter of deciding how to dance and carry, whether to digest or be wounded. For art to be powerful ,real art, you need both, which means that the artist has two challenges, the second of which is to seduce.\n\nThis is successful only in the first, the birthing. One can clearly see that we have someone who knows what he wants and has the ability to make it so. This film is a completely coherent creation, each part bonding to the others in a way that conveys perhaps a too understandable effect. In this, it is much closer to ordinary Soviet film-making than Tarkovksy, to whom this fellow is often compared.\n\nSo its a nicely machined object. There&apos;s craft, vision.\n\nBut it didn&apos;t convey to me at all, probably because no matter how much I open myself, I don&apos;t have the nightmares it depends on. I imagine this resonated with its intended audience: citizens of a country cobble together from grotesquely primitive regions and managed with mechanical brutality.\n\nI image that if you live close to Islam, or close to a supremely backward people, mixed in with the opposing violences of occupation... where everyone is underemployed and no art finds a happy garden... where paper matters and there&apos;s no escaping the heat... where all that you and everyone around you just want to do is run away...\n\n...it might resonate.\n\nMeanwhile, what you&apos;ll get is a dreamy meditation for others. He hasn&apos;t brought it to me.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

Adapted from the Wilbur Smith novel, it is based on a true story about a raid on the SMS Konigsberg by an ivory hunter in World War I. It is an opulent film, well photographed but pastiche, the sort of actioner that harks back to an older generation of films featuring exploitative, larger-than-life characters put through a cavalcade of action and unlikely situations, out of which humour and thrills naturally arise, with a cartoonish villain to satisfy all tastes. Lee Marvin plays wonderfully, a man on the make, out to plunder the environment, downing copious amounts of hooch in the process, and Roger Moore, as Sebastian Oldsmith, fits his part well, giving contrast as an establishment toff. Both commit and play amiably amidst some slack and silly slapstick comedy. Peter R. Hunt stages scenes with workmanlike efficiency, although some sequences are like longueurs. Overall, it is a treat as a postprandial Sunday matinee. As an aside, the full theatrical release is the version that garnered more credit for the fuller and more rounded characters it portrays, though some extra scenes are stark in portraying the ivory trade.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow - I had already read reviews of this movie, and with the writer being one of my favourite directors, Luc Besson, I just had to go see this movie as soon as possible...\n\nI was not disappointed... I&apos;m not sure if this was intentional but there were no trailers before the movie, so being thrown strait into the film unexpectedly with people whispering &quot;is this it then ?&quot; only helping build up some initial tension and excitement.\n\nThe film starts nicely, but with overtones of spy thrillers like &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot; coming to mind. Neeson seems a bit pityful at the start, but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thriller.\n\nThen, before you know it, it&apos;s over. 93 minutes, gone in a blur of fighting, fear, chasing and excitement at serious pace. The artwork and direction is nicely done, giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possible.\n\nIt was one of those films that I wanted to applause after the film, I actually clapped about three times, but no-one joined in... too afraid of being the only two people clapping I suppose...\n\nNeeson was great, and I can&apos;t wait to see the movie many more times. I only gave it 9 out of 10, as it was too short ! The film could have been easily stretched to 2 hours in my opinion, with some more development and intimacy with the characters. But I guess this may have not made it so exciting... still, well worth the money to see this in the big screen.",

We remember this as a boring film, and several times during the showing we thought it was ending and we were getting ready to leave, but no, it continued. We can&apos;t believe that it was only on for 101mins. It seemed like days. Since seeing IMDb giving it 7/10 we thought about finding it and watching it again. The thought lasted under a second by which time we decided we would prefer to watch the paint dry on our newly decorated door. This film may improve with age, but I doubt it. Not many films do.",

      "reviewBody": "Though on the surface it might be seen as yet another movie about poverty in Mississippi (which is, by the way, the poorest State in the US) or about the impact of the Vietnam War on the family of veterans, &quot;The War&quot; exceeds expectations on several fronts: presentation, complexity, candidness, and good acting. The story is narrated from the point of view of 12-year old Lidia, played excellently by Lexi Randall, with the acceptance kids usually have at that age (&quot;we are dirt poor, like everyone else in Juliette, Mississippi&quot; - she tells us right of the start). Though she is white, she befriends two black girls the same age, sharing social condition and taste for music, with some hiccup due to her use of language blacks don&apos;t like others to use on them. She is &quot;tough&quot; as kids in that environment usually are, yet &quot;girlish&quot; in step with her age. She is the one sensitive enough to realize how others feel and has the guts to naturally stand for them, though she struggles to understand her father. Her brother Stu, about the same age, played impeccably by Elijah Wood, is eager, as most boys at that age are, to get close to his father, and in the period they manage to do it he puts is heart in the basket, at great risk. The father, also played impeccably by Kevin Costner, is troubled by war nightmares and the lack of a stable job, but has the courage to eliminate violence from daily living, aiming to show it to his kids by example, against the pressure for violence from the environment they live in, and to be as good a father as he can in the given circumstances. The kids are at the front of events throughout the film, and the story brilliantly shows us how a rivalry with a group of poorer and tougher kids, centered on the use of a tree house made by the former with materials stolen from the latter, gradually escalates into a dangerous &quot;juvenile war&quot;, much the way political conflicts often escalate into wars among nations. &quot;No matter how much people think they understand war, war doesn&apos;t understand people&quot;, the girl concludes; thus we all lose. The War goes on at several levels: Kids fighting in the forefront, Vietnam in the background, and the inner struggles of the main characters, being this latter what truly gives depth to the story. Drama is sparkled with hope, humor and coziness, the way it is in life, with very few cheesy scenes. This movie is more that entertainment: it triggers our critical thinking, our capacity for understanding, and leaves a haunting feeling long after is done. Recommendable as a family film for discussion, meaning kids 12 or older with some level of maturity. Not for younger kids.",

The brutality of hindus upon untouchables and the denial of their human rights reflects the hypocrisy of hindu leaders who were demamding swaraj. The untouchables were not allowed to drink water from public wells.They were given rooms for rent.Dr Ambedkar himself had to suffer these ignominies when he returned to India after finishing his education in America to serve Baroda state.Gandhi ji whom we all considers a great leader opposed ambedkar&apos;s demand of separate electorates.The movie shows that even Gandhi was very apologetic of the chaturvarnya which is the root of casteism.The character of Babasaheb&apos;s wife has been also portrayed well.\n\nAll in all,the movie enriches our knowledge bank and also gives inspiration.",

The dialog was so bad, it was a relief that you couldn&apos;t understand the words.\n\nThe pace of the movie was so slow, it was almost 2 hours, 10 minutes would have done this movie better.\n\nI don&apos;t think this movie should be rented unless you want to laugh, because it is not scary",

      "reviewBody": "Snow Angels is set in a small town in America during a non-specific time. There are few details that define or accentuate time and place. It could be any small town, USA, and for all we know, it could be the present. All we really know is that it is cold and wintertime. Directed by David Gordon Green, Snow Angels is a somber, affecting meditation on sadness and fate, based on the novel written by Stewart O&apos;Nan. It chronicles two weeks in the life of the central characters, whose lives are all connected in some way.\n\nThe movie begins with striking images of winter, barren trees and snow. A high school marching band is rehearsing outdoors for the football game. They are lethargic and out of tune. Their instructor chides them, and we here the sound of what might be gunshots in the distance. Everything stops and the story goes back to two weeks prior, where the characters are introduced. We see Arthur (Michael Angarano) the high school student busing tables in a Chinese restaurant. He works with his older friend Annie, played by Kate Beckinsale, the newly separated mother who used to baby-sit for Michael when he was young. Annie gives Arthur a ride home when his mother forgets to pick him up. Arthur&apos;s parents, played by Jeanette Arnette and Griffin Dunne, are also going through a separation.\n\nLater we meet Annie&apos;s estranged husband Glen, played by Sam Rockwell. Early on we learn that he has had problems with drinking and keeping a job and even tried to take his own life as a result of his life apart from Annie and the baby. Somehow, he survived the suicide and has become a born again Christian, but his stability remains uncertain. We also meet the new student Lila, played by Olivia Thirlby, who befriends Arthur. Lila is the outsider who takes photographs as a hobby. She is on the outside literally peering in, like the audience. Early on, she shows Arthur her photographs of the town. Since her family moves around a lot, she likes to take pictures of her first impressions of the new places she moves to. They are beautiful portraits, all black and white, mostly of them empty landscapes and snow. Coldness and alienation is a constant theme that wraps around the characters to a nearly suffocating extent.\n\nGreen&apos;s direction is deliberate and slowly paced. The camera rests patiently upon the characters, giving them time to grow and breathe. Even in awkward moments, as there are in the life of a teenager, and in the tension rising moments of the adults who are enduring emotional pain, the shots are long and deliberate, with a quiet, gentle soundtrack that does not try to manipulate or force the action. Green allows the dialog and the performances of the actors drive the story. There is no melodrama, just painfully sad realities.\n\nSnow Angels has the feel of an independent film in its simple story-telling and without bloated production values or faux sentimentality or gimmicky performances. It feels like real life, real people in a real town. The only problem is that it&apos;s real, real sad. In fact, it&apos;s too sad. Despite the artful direction and nuanced performances, the film itself has little balance, nothing to contrast the heavy weight of angst that smothers the characters as well as the audience. Fargo, (1996), was a similar movie  a tragic tale of human failings, set in a vast, winter of emptiness. And yet, there were many contrasting elements which balanced the mood, such as hilarious dialog and mannerisms, a riveting, driving musical score and shocking, unexpected violence. Many aspects of that film were recognized for achievement in film-making and I believe it even received Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I would also dare say that this movie energized the careers of several of its little known actors and deservedly so, including Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy and Frances McDormand. But Snow Angels provides no such relief from its oppressive tone. I get the feeling that Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale needed an immediate retreat to a warm, tropic island after making this picture, (or at least a few sessions of therapy), and through no fault of their own. Their performances are great, but the movie, over all, leaves you with the need for immediate cleansing or escape, to anywhere that&apos;s warm.",

      "reviewBody": "Why almost every single movie I watched from the 2000s feels like it&apos;s dragging on?\n\nI suppose it was a sort of style back then. I have seen the remake of this movie twice, and I do see the resemblence. However, here, I did not appreciate the lack of story arcs.\n\nThe main motivation for our lead character is established, but the background and other, more broad information is lacking. I would love to know more about his past. If he started to learn how to actually handle a gun only recently, or if he has some past to back it up.\n\nI also missed the background on the whole crew of robbers.\n\nThe first half of the film, it feels like literally nothing is happening. Then it takes a turn, and the rest of the runtime is packed with story.\n\nIt is more of a drama, than an action film, but I could not handle the horrible visual effects, that were pulling me out of otherwise pretty well-handled action scenes. Even if there were only few of them.\n\nUsing smoke grennades as props for VFX flashbangs was definitely an interesting idea, but did not work out at all.\n\nThis movie came out 20 years ago, back then, quality VFX was much harder to do, and I am glad they attempted, however, when they saw it was not working out, they should have chosen a different path.\n\nThe concept of this film is very interesting, and I&apos;m glad it was chosen as a basis for a remake, which did add a lot, and covered a lot of what I missed in this movie. But it had to be a great foundation, for the later writers, to be able to build on something.\n\nThis movie deserves a watch, gives insight, into the &quot;low budget&quot; french cinema of the 2000s. I mean for one tenth of the budget for &quot;Wrath of Man&quot; this is a solid piece of work.",

      "reviewBody": "OK, the first thing that must be said about this movie is that yes, it is essentially the same exact premise as &quot;Paranormal Activity.&quot; Therefore, it loses serious points in the originality category right from the start. It is unsettling to me that a filmmaker would make such a blatant copy of another film rather than trying to make something truly original but nevertheless, here we are with &quot;Paranormal Entity.&quot; All that being said, I was surprised to find that this movie is actually good. Despite being upsettingly similar to &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot;, it does set itself apart in certain subtle ways that make an interesting difference in the overall mood of the movie. The &quot;real footage&quot; gimmick is starting to get a little worn out, but it&apos;s used very effectively here.\n\nWhile I think good film reviews in general should not compare films directly to another one, in this case I think it&apos;s safe to say that that&apos;s a little unavoidable, so I will say that next to &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; this film almost comes out superior, originality issues aside. While I found the first version of this story to be a solid, suspenseful build-up to a satisfying pay-off, I felt that the &quot;rip-off&quot; was in fact more suspenseful throughout. While there were few actual scares, several of the scenes were incredibly tense. It did a very good job of putting me on the edge of my seat and getting my heart rate up from anticipation. I normally don&apos;t expect to be able to say this about such an unoriginal film, but I genuinely felt nervous about what was going to appear on the screen next during 2 or 3 of the scenes, which I have to admit is horror the way it should be.\n\nUnfortunately it didn&apos;t quite pay off as well as &quot;Paranormal Activity.&quot; The ending seemed rushed and while it was a bit unsettling, it didn&apos;t leave me feeling as tense as some of the scenes earlier on, and most certainly didn&apos;t leave me feeling terrified. The acting in the film is nothing Oscar-worthy but I found it to be adequate and mostly believable. There are a few continuity goofs that some may notice. I personally didn&apos;t find them to be terribly distracting, though they do suggest a bit of laziness by the filmmakers. \n\nWhile some may feel that the obvious lack of originality should make this film completely dismissable, I feel that some of the content of this movie is indeed impressive and is worth checking out. Therefore, on a scale of good film-making i&apos;m going to give this a fairly lenient 6/10. However, on the overall enjoyment scale I would give it an 8/10, and had this film been completely original and perhaps had a more exciting ending I would have given it a solid 8.5 or 9 out of 10 overall.\n\nSo in closing, it loses significant respect for obvious reasons but gains a little back in certain ways and is worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "I Know: Robert Wagner&apos;s hairdo is sort of unbearable; Janet Leigh&apos;s white wig is too much; Valiant&apos;s sword looks over-sized; Sterling Hayden behaves like a contemporary New Yorker; it&apos;s very easy to imagine who the black knight is; vikings didn&apos;t have horns in their helmets; and so on.\n\nBut somehow I found this medieval story based on Harold Foster&apos;s characters entertaining and I even enjoyed it. In fact I think that for 1954 &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; takes the most of Foster&apos;s novels about knights and vikings in the times of legendary King Arthur.\n\nGood colorful locations, fine settings, good action scenes and a sort of &quot;sticky&quot; musical score that even sounds appropriate help the picture along with an acceptable script and Henry Hathaway&apos;s prolix direction.\n\nHighlights o the movie are James Mason&apos;s convincing villain, Brian Aherne&apos;s fine portrayal of King Arthur and a violent and smashing final duel between Valiant and the unmasked Black Knight.\n\nIf you like medieval costume adventures you&apos;ll enjoy this one too.",

      "name": "Self-referential early German talkie that is a series of spoofs",
      "reviewBody": "This film came out in August 1930, only 8 months after Melody of the Heart (1929), the first German talkie. It was basically an experiment with the new genre. Apparently it was quite well received at the time, but I think today it is of little interest except for film historians or Max Hansen fans.\n\nThe title suggests that this should be a parody of German expressionist silent movie The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), but it is not. I don&apos;t think a Dr. Larifari even occurs in the film. It is a series of short spoof sequences (parodying well known films or cabaret acts or spoofing entire genres) held together by a self-referential framing story. In the first scene, three men sitting in a café spontaneously decide to found a talkie film company to fight their boredom. None of them has any capital, but that is explicitly not an obstacle.\n\nThe remainder of the film alternates between scenes based on the three men&apos;s ideas of what directing a film company is like, and excerpts from various films that this company might produce. Unfortunately the pacing is rather slow and the humor too low-key by today&apos;s standards. For example, the Bavarian singing student scene, which is clearly intended as a parody of comedian Karl Valentin, is so boring that I wouldn&apos;t even call it a sketch. The film company interior looks grotesque as in an expressionist film, for example a ridiculously high door. That was probably quite funny at a time when expressionist films had been out of fashion for about 5 years and all the old silent films had become irrelevant anyway. But for us modern viewers, the difference between a black and white talkie from 1930 and a silent film from 1925 is far less dramatic, so the joke falls mostly flat.\n\nThe founders of the Trio Film Company, who are also its principal actors (besides being the principal chasers of the company secretary), were three contemporary stars who might have appeared in a Kabarett (political cabaret) together.\n\nMax Hansen was an operetta tenor, Kabarett singer and actor. Born out of wedlock to a Danish actress in Germany, he was technically Danish but grew up in Germany. His father was probably a Hungarian of Jewish descent. Today he is still somewhat known for his excellent pop songs, many of which also exist in later cover versions. (Although the original recordings are much better in my opinion.) One of them, &quot;War&apos;n Sie schon mal in mich verliebt?&quot; (1932), made fun of Adolf Hitler and caused him difficulties that forced him to emigrate.\n\nPaul Morgan was an Austrian actor and comedian of Jewish descent who would later be murdered at Buchenwald.\n\nCarl Jöken was a German tenor and occasional actor.\n\nThe Trio-Film GmbH was actually a real film company founded by the three actors in real life, but it never produced another film after this one. I doubt that it was because of a dispute over the secretary. More likely the funding ran out because their first film wasn&apos;t such a big hit, after all.",

      "reviewBody": "In approaching this film, one must bear in mind that, despite the historical setting, it is not a source of reliable biographical information on Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, not is it intended to be. In fact, practically all episodes shown in the film are fictitious (which makes it no worse than &apos;Amadeus&apos;, &apos;Immortal Beloved&apos; or &apos;Copying Beethoven&apos;). Nevertheless, this is a very compelling drama exploring the loneliness of the gifted and highly original creative genius struggling with the contradiction between the absolute demands of his artistic calling and the compromises required to please an audience and secure employment.\n\nAlthough the plot is not strictly historical, the film creates a very authentic mood and is free of glaring anachronisms (such as found in &apos;Amadeus&apos; or, far worse, &apos;Copying Beethoven&apos;); not only the costumes and props, but also the character&apos;s attitudes fit the period. Moreover, considering the time of production, this film is enjoyably free of propaganda.\n\nIn summary, this is a little known gem which lovers of mid-18th century music will find entertaining. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Side note: The animated short Paper Man was very good. The animation was a unique blend of CGI but made to look like hand drawn animation. The only slight issue I had with it is that the short got crazy at the end and became unbelievable. Still cute.\n\nBeing a gamer, I decided to go to this movie. I knew the movie was going to be good, but I didn&apos;t expect it to be really good. The action, humor, voice-acting, plot, and animation are all great. Since this movie is aimed towards gamers, I feel like a lot of the cameos and jokes are going to fly over most people&apos;s heads, such as &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot; written on a subway wall or &quot;Leroy Jenkins was here&quot;. Thankfully, the movie doesn&apos;t rely on cameos to be successful.\n\nThe animation in Wreck-It Ralph is very beautiful, and is great at expressing the video game world. I did not see it in 3D, but just from watching it in 2D I can tell that this movie would look amazing in 3D. The animators did really good in this movie because each video game world looks vastly different from another. Each world feels like an actual video game that I&apos;ve played. If there is one problem that I can pick out in this movie (and many others have noted this as well) is that the plot focuses on the Sugar Rush world a bit too much. Most of the other worlds are revealed at the beginning mainly for the sake of reference, with only a few actually being important.\n\nThe humor in Wreck-It Ralph is good because it hits a very large audience. A lot of the cameos and jokes are related to video games but there are also a lot of movie references as well, puns, slapstick jokes, and some crude humor. Some people complained at the crude humor but honestly it didn&apos;t bother me because it was coming from a character who looks like she is five, so it actually made sense.\n\nThe interesting thing about Wreck-It Ralph&apos;s plot is that it has very little to do with an external conflict, but more with an internal one (which is a pun in itself because they are inside of video games). There is a main bad guy, and a huge disaster, and all of these other conflicts but these elements are back seat to the character development. I thought it was neat since most animated movies do the opposite. The voices for all of the characters were really well done. There weren&apos;t any annoying characters which adds to the movie. Another nice thing about the plot is that main bad guy is not revealed until the very end of the movie which focuses the plot on the characters, not the action or the villain.\n\nOverall a really great movie. Spectacular animation, great voice work, emotional and even touching at times, and overall humorous. While the Sugar Rush world might get slightly stale after awhile, it is still excellent movie. Gamers, this goes to you, WATCH THIS MOVIE!",

      "reviewBody": "As a horror-movie fan I try to watch all significant novelties of this genre, especially those which are the products of my native cinema. And I can say that that the &quot;Power of Fear&quot; (or &quot;Vedma&quot; as the Russian title of it) is one of the weakest film among them. Firstly, it can&apos;t scary even a little kid, it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror. Frankly speaking, it&apos;s bad in all points: from the goofy plot (I don&apos;t know why the Russian producers/director decided to transform the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern-day-America thriller. I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it doesn&apos;t thrill a bit) and to the terrible and cheesy actors&apos; work. All actors including the leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are quite famous in Russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn&apos;t even bother to play at all, only spoke their English lines without any expression. And at the end I don&apos;t really understand why they filmed this flick in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could cast some American or English actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing. The same I can say about so called &quot;small American town backgrounds&quot; which were shot in Estonia and look like it. The only positive moment I found in the &quot;Power of Fear&quot; is the visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is OK, at least it doesn&apos;t irritate me. That&apos;s why I give it two stars. Overall, if you want to see good horror film  don&apos;t waste your time and money on this boring flick. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror I&apos;d advise you to find a copy of &quot;Viy or The Spirit of Evil&quot;. It&apos;s really the terrific movie based on the same novel as &quot;Power of Fear&quot; but much, much better.",

      "reviewBody": "Black is an unusual and interesting film in idea and visualization. It&apos;s a very special film and there is no doubt; Sanjay Leela Bhansali is among the best talents Indian Film Industry has produced. \n\nThere have been films like Sadma, Sparsh and Koi Mil Gaya and Sanjay&apos;s directorial debut Khamoshi - The Musical, where the protagonists of the films were physically challenged. KHAMOSHI - THE MUSICAL, was a tale of a deaf and dumb couple and their ordinary child. Despite the presence of matinée idols like Salman Khan, Manisha Koirala and Nana Patekar, the film failed. \n\nBlack cannot be described in sheer words. It has been handled with extreme kindliness and it does boast of a plot that&apos;s rarely attempted on the Indian screen. Before this movie, Gulzar made a movie &apos;Koshish&apos; in early 70&apos;s starring Jaya Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar for which they have won the awards.\n\nMichelle McNally (Ayesha Kapur/Rani Mukerji), born to an Anglo-Indian family, is deaf and blind. She is a bright and intelligent girl and she lives in the world of black and this frustrates her because she desires to speak. Therefore, because of her frustration she becomes harsh and cruel on numerous events.\n\nDebraj Sahai (Amitabh Bachchan) is a strange person. He is an alcoholic, a teacher to the deaf and blind children. The principal of the school believes in his ability and sends him to the McNally house to teach Michelle. Debraj&apos;s arrival at the McNally home is far from favorable, as he arrives intoxicated, annoyed and impolite. On encountering Michelle, Debraj realizes that the only way to tackle her is to distress her, be violent at times and at the same time, show her the love.\n\nDebraj succeeds and Michelle amazingly learns her first word - Ma. But this is just the beginning. There are several battles to be won. His dreams of Michelle going to a college with students without any disability. But, at this stage, Debraj starts to suffer from Alzheimer. He slowly forgets everything including all words and their meanings. The roles are now reversed!\n\nSanjay Leela Bhansali explanation of Helen Keller&apos;s outstanding life and the role Annie Sullivan played in her life. The real-life story was presented on the big screen in the 1962&apos;s Hollywood flick THE MIRACLE WORKER, which starred Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft for which both the performers won the Oscars.\n\nA film like BLACK relies heavily on performances and Bhansali has extracted award-worthy work from practically the entire cast. When you talk of BLACK, it&apos;s not just Bachchan or Rani&apos;s work you would like to extol, but Shernaz Patel, Nandana Sen, Dhritiman Chaterji and Ayesha Kapur&apos;s contribution as well.\n\nInternational Cinematography by Ravi K. Chandran. Each and every frame is laudable of a great compliment. Omung Kumar has created lively sets for the film. The Shimla shopping mall has been reconstructed to precision in Mumbai. Background music by Monty is apt. BLACK belongs to Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji primarily. After Khakee and Dev, this one is his best performance and for this role, he felt that for the last 25 years I have been working in the movies but this is the first time that I have shown such an interest. Bachchan comes up with a performance that he&apos;ll always be remembered for!\n\nThere&apos;s no denying that Rani delivers her best performance to date and her performance in this movie has topped on the number one spot and crossed her early performances i.e. &apos;Yuva&apos;, &apos;Hum Tum&apos; and &apos;Veer - Zaara&apos;. Rani has conveyed through expressions exclusively. Here&apos;s a performance that should act as a reference guide for all aspiring actors. And yes, she&apos;s bound to walk away with all major awards next year as well!\n\nShernaz Patel is exceptional. Her sequences with Bachchan are awesome. Dhritiman Chaterji is excellent. Nandana Sen impresses in a small but significant role. Ayesha Kapur is first-rate and she should be given a special award next year in every award ceremony. And also Best Perfromances award should be given to Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee. If Bollywood has to move ahead with time we will be open to experiments like this. A must watch for those who like different cinema. After Lagaan, The Legend Of Bhagat Singh, Kaante, Khakee, this is the movie, which can compete with any Hollywood Movie. Rating: 4 Out Of 5"

Later on I saw Wajda&apos;s &apos;Generation&apos; trilogy and could barely believe that this was the same director. I have subsequently seen it on the big screen a couple of times and it remains a favourite from its era. The reason was simply that the creative force behind &apos;Innocent Sorcerers&apos; is not Wajda but Jerzy Skolimowski.\n\nYou only need to take a look at &apos;Walkover&apos; to see the same callous and alienated attitude of the central character. However, for me, &apos;Innocent Sorcerers&apos; is a superior film to Skolimowski&apos;s earliest directorial works as, through the character of Pelagia, a much greater warmth and meaning is expressed.\n\nKrystyna Stypulkowska makes a perfect Pelagia - coquettish and flirtatious, but still innocent. The exquisite scene of &apos;tossing the matchbox&apos; is more erotic than all but a handful of &apos;explicit&apos; sex scenes from modern cinema.\n\nThere are few films from Eastern Europe in the Soviet era that ever make you really care about the characters - this is definitely one.",

      "reviewBody": "In January of 1940 nearly seven years after the release of the first film (a classic in every sense of the word), it&apos;s sequel &quot;The Invisible Man Returns&quot; arrived, this time he&apos;s played by an American actor - the late and great Vincent Price.\n\nIn The Invisible Man Returns the dapper and refined 6 foot 5 actor portrays the invisible man with a fair degree of effectiveness (though certainly not as spectacularly or as vividly as his British counterpart years earlier) and the film as a whole is a handsomely staged, big-budget sequel that features a good cast and an even better crew backing them up. To put it one way when the invisible man returned so did the renowned special-effects expert John P. Fulton; whose indelible contributions greatly enhanced the distinctive visual style of The Invisible Man film series and several other early Universal classics. If only the director of this film was as talented as it&apos;s special-effect guru, but that&apos;s certainly not the case here. The first Invisible Man film benefited from the masterful direction of James Whale, however, this film was directed by a far less talented director, Joe May (a veteran German director of temperamental nature) whose workman-like sense of direction clearly doesn&apos;t produce the same levels of energy or enthusiasm. However, if there&apos;s one aspect where this film is superior to the first film, it would certainly be from a musical angle, The Invisible Man Returns is blessed with one of the best efforts from the the renowned duo of Hans J. Salter and Frank Skinner; who at the time were Universal Studio&apos;s go-to team when a new horror score was needed. I&apos;d also say that The Invisible Man Returns has the edge in terms of cinematography, the sequel has a bit more spit and polish to it compared to the original, resulting in an overall smoother visual presentation. You certainly can&apos;t fault this films camera-work, it&apos;s beautifully shot from the opening frame to the last.\n\nHowever, every time I see The Invisible Man Returns it leaves me with the same impression, though it&apos;s a good sequel, it&apos;s certainly not in the same league as the original. It&apos;s obviously lacking much of the verve and excitement that the first film has in spades. But why is that? First off lets start with the cast, Vincent Price though visually more impressive at a towering 6&apos;5, but the actors voice is definitely not the equal to that of Claude Rains, maybe had he been 30 years older at the time that would have made the difference, as his voice became much more distinctive with age. Secondly director Joe May simply lacked the distinctive flair for sly and witty or &quot;impish&quot; humor that James Whale was well known for. Thirdly the movies script required that the invisible man&apos;s actions to be held much more in check this time around, because after all, unlike in the original film, in the sequel the invisible man is the &quot;good guy&quot; and as the rules stipulate the good guys can&apos;t be running around the countryside murdering and maiming. Those are three obvious reasons I could detect as to why this sequel fails to live up to the original - though there may be more. Even so there&apos;s still a lot to like about this classic film, such as, the invisibility effects which are every bit as good and in some cases even better than first film, you get a few good hefty doses of those distinctively ego-maniacal rantings and ravings (a side-effect of the invisibility drug), there&apos;s the aforementioned musical brilliance, then there&apos;s the humor aspect and though it&apos;s not as funny as one would hope, it&apos;s certainly not devoid of humor, as there are several funny moments seen throughout the film - people think they&apos;re seeing ghosts after all.\n\nAnd if the Invisible Man Returns doesn&apos;t move you, relax, because there were at least three other &quot;Invisible&quot; movies made shortly thereafter in the form of &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (1940), &quot;Invisible Agent&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Invisible Man&apos;s Revenge&quot; (1944). It&apos;s my opinion that none of those three are better than the first two films, but they too have there moments and not surprisingly The Invisible Woman is the lightest and most whimsical of the lot (having none of the demonic charm and vindictive fury that THE Invisible Man, a.k.a. Claude Rains, exudes).\n\nOne last thing, as of yet I still haven&apos;t heard a compelling answer as to why they changed the named of the drug from Monocaine to Duocaine. Personally I always preferred Monocaine, simply because it sounds like the more dangerous of the two.",

First of all, kudos to Pras for having the courage to go undercover and actually live on the streets with no food or shelter, and tape everything for the whole world to see. This film is extremely revealing. It introduces the homeless as people, it puts a face to the epidemic of homelessness- revealing who they are and how they ended up on the streets. I will never look at a homeless person the same way. Skid Row is not the usual boring voice-over/ talking head doc that many are acquainted with. In Skid Row, you see Pras as a vulnerable man, not as the untouchable hip-hop star of the Fugees that we are familiar with. This is honestly the best documentary I&apos;ve ever seen. Skid Row definitely deserves an Oscar!",

      "reviewBody": "Decent entertainment from &apos;The Wonderful World of Disney&apos;: this is a tale set during the waning days of the Civil War. Young Jamie McIver (Mitch Vogel, &quot;The Reivers&quot;) has become the man of the household after his father (Charles Aidman, &quot;Dirty Little Billy&quot;) went off to fight in the war. The first half has Jamie determined to bag a panther that has been terrorizing the community, the second half has the McIvers dealing with a truly despicable worm named Poss Timmerlake (Albert Salmi, &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot;), an Army deserter / troublemaker, and his evil bushwhacker associates.\n\nBasically a coming of age story, much of it focuses on Jamies&apos; intent on becoming a man, and his enlightenment as well; he learns that Yankees really aren&apos;t such bad guys after all. This, after his mother (Pat Crowley, &apos;Please Don&apos;t Eat the Daisies&apos;) insists on showing kindness and compassion to a Yankee officer (Richard Anderson, &apos;The Six Million Dollar Man&apos;) who&apos;s half-crazed and in bad shape. Later, Anderson returns the favor, impressing Jamie, as he and his troops join Pa McIver and his associates in taking the fight to the bushwhackers.\n\nAlthough nothing exceptional, this is easy enough to watch: well-acted, well-intentioned, appealing, and nicely shot. It helps that Salmi, a character actor always at his best when playing villains, is so convincing: you can&apos;t WAIT to see him get his. And Vogel is sufficiently likeable in the lead role.\n\nDirected by Vincent McEveety, whose other Disney credits include &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot;, &quot;Gus&quot;, and two of the &quot;Love Bug&quot; movies.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

For me personally, I never seem to agree with Crowe&apos;s casting taste (Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson never do much for me) but Cameron has a way with actors and a true vision for his story. He always seems to know exactly who can capture his characters and ultimately draw out your emotions that he&apos;s tugging at. \n\nIn We Bought a Zoo, there is a bit of a slow start and at one point I was worried Cameron had lowered his voice to appeal to a larger audience to please producers and critics alike (after his Critically-bombed but personal all time fav, Elizabethtown). \n\nBut let me tell you, pay your dues with the first half of this film because the second half will take you on a mesmerizing cinematic adventure you&apos;ll be heartbroken for more. Cameron ventures into a new family drama without compromising his voice, music taste or quality film making. And if you are still not a huge CC fan, the animals are sure to win you over. Their beautiful and natural moments on screen are as breath taking as they are tear-jerking.\n\nSpend an amazing two hours with this film and there won&apos;t be a person in your household that won&apos;t agree that this film is one to remember. From a fan and living-room-critic, I give it two thumbs up :)",

      "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) Three chipmunk brothers, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are living their lives in the forest storing nuts away for the winter when one day their tree is cut down and carried off into the city to become a Christmas tree. They must find a new home and they end up at Dave&apos;s house. The only thing that makes them different is that they can talk and even sing. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling song writer who has a great idea about making the chipmunks a new show act, singing his songs. The only thing is that you must remember is that they are chipmunks and they act like chipmunks by tearing up Dave&apos;s house and interrupting his love life. However, they also begin to bond as a family with Dave becoming like a Dad. The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. The record company executive Ian (David Cross) sees big money in his future and takes over the act and pushes Dave to the side. Dave must try to save his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster.\n\n(My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good memories. I can&apos;t believe that their first song was recorded 50 years ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were 50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of &quot;Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!&quot; and Alvin would say &quot;OooooK!!!&quot; Those two words just make you smile. Children of all ages can see this movie without any problem. I am sure that all the parents will like it, and I know your child will, because it is a fun movie. (20th Century Fox, Run Time 1:30, Rated PG) (8/10)",

The makers of such scream clones were obviously faced with a dilemma, how not to stray too far from a winning formula  yet be original at the same time  therefore in this one they give the story a little twist. Here, the preposterous twist is that the killer only kills virgins!  sending the youths in the local village sex mad  - in order to save their life, obviously!!.\n\nAs bad as it sounds, its not all bad, especially when the absolutely delicious Brittany Murphy is the lead role as the daughter of the local sheriff (Michael Biehn) who is investigating these grisly murders  and guess what, she&apos;s a virgin!!. The final twist is pretty good, although if you really think about, the killers motive for hating all virgins isn&apos;t really that convincing, Fun though if you take it for what it is, enjoyable rubbish!!",

      "reviewBody": "I liked this gritty and harsh exploitation/revenge feature, and don&apos;t quite understand why it&apos;s so unknown and forgotten (and the people who do know it don&apos;t even seem to like it). True, the script somewhat moves too slow and quite a few sequences easily could have been cut, but the main premise is fascinating, the two main characters are likable and the pivot scenes are often so full of tension you have any nails left to bite by the time they&apos;re finished. David and Jill couldn&apos;t be happier on their wedding day. Finally reunited after David spent two years in the hell of Vietnam and they even escaped Jill&apos;s family traditional wedding ritual where they &quot;hunt&quot; the newlyweds and hope to ruin their first night together. Whilst hiding in a sleazy Cajun motel, David and Jill witness the execution of a corrupt businessman by hired hit men. The crazed killers knock David KO and viciously rape Jill. After this tragedy they attempt to pick up their lives again, but Jill is an emotional wreck and David has exclusively set his mind on retribution. They embark on a search to find out the rapists identities, which leads them all the way to New Orleans. One of the great things about &quot;Nightmare Honeymoon&quot;  in my humble opinion at least  is that the character drawings are more realistic and identifiable. The reason why the film doesn&apos;t contain that much violent action or rancid sleaze is because Elliot Silverstein largely puts the emphasis on the series of emotions the newlyweds go through, together as well as separately. David becomes so increasingly obsessed with the idea of revenge, he&apos;s often frightening himself and Jill suddenly questions her marriage, her feelings and even her own femininity. The final confrontation with the deranged rapist Lee (excellent performance by John Beck) is rather overlong but atmospheric and you genuinely pray for the couple to walk out of the showdown alive. The performances are great with very convincing roles for Dack Rambo (awesome name, dude) as David and the cherubic Rebecca Dianna Smith as Jill. Elliot Silverstein&apos;s direction is tight and solid. He completed this little 70&apos;s gem in between directing his two most famous and much more publicly acclaimed achievements, namely the western drama (and predecessor of &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;) &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; and horror-favorite &quot;The Car&quot;, about a satanically possessed vehicle terrorizing the inhabitants of a small desert town.",

      "name": "A little Irish fairy tale of love and luck",
      "reviewBody": "Everything about Neil Jordan&apos;s Ondine, a middling good and very Irish expression of his unique vision, is soft around the edges, like the lilting speech of County Cork, where the action takes place, by the sea, whose gentle waters (hithering and thithering waters of, Joyce called the Liffey) deliver a girl into a fisherman&apos;s net. Is she a real girl (&quot;one of those asylum seekers,&quot; her finder asks) or a selkie or an ondine, a sea nymph, a mermaid temporarily gone human? The distinctions have gone blurry, and the movie swings between fairy tale and a harsh account of modern realities. Ondine succeeds or fails by virtue of its gentleness and deliberately blurred distinctions. It&apos;s a nice little story but a fragile one, so understated and gentle it could pass unnoticed if you don&apos;t pay good attention; and the accents are so thick we could have very much benefited by having subtitles. Once again it shows this director remains his own man, true to his literary roots and his Irish ones when he wants to be.\n\nThe fisherman is Syracuse (Colin Farrell), but his name has been rounded off to &quot;Circus,&quot; and Farrell has softened back his voice to an (often incomprehensible) Irish murmur. He says they call him &quot;Circus&quot; because as a drunk he was such a clown. He&apos;s been sober for two years, ten months, and 21 days and counting, but he&apos;s treading water, in need of something. Circus has a daughter, Annie, whom he cares for, but she lives with her mother, and he lives by himself, and he&apos;s too warm and friendly a fellow for that to be right for him. He lives on the edge, a bit uneasily, between sobriety and drunkenness, solitude and a marital state, happiness and bitter disappointment. When he pulls the mysterious female out of the water, she offers hope of something new.\n\nNeil Jordan has always had a gift for transformation and blurred edges. In his very first film, a mild-mannered musician, played by Stephen Rea, changes into a revenge killer, his trumpet morphed into a gun. A Jordan regular forever after and virtually his muse, Rea has been described by Todd McCarthy in terms of ambiguity: &quot;handsome-homely, decisive-passive, gentle-violent.&quot; It&apos;s true you don&apos;t know quite how to take Stephen Rea half the time, and that&apos;s the beauty of him. Jordan&apos;s most celebrated film, The Crying Game, veers with pleasing and surprising complexity between opposites of sex and politics, keynoted by the fascinatingly androgynous Jaye Davidson. The Irish novelist-turned-auteur filmmaker has dealt in the past with mythical transforming creatures in Interview with the Vampire and In the Company of Wolves.\n\nOndine is in a lower key, however. The shapely and mysterious young woman Circus catches in his net (Alicja Bachleda, a Polish actress born in Mexico) can&apos;t be pinned down. Not, at least, till till the action finale, which brings things to a conclusion with a series of happy accidents. As Circus may have hoped, she becomes a source of luck. Ondine is what she says her name is. When she goes out fishing with Circus, her singing seems to fill his pots with lobsters and his net with salmon. He desires her. He likes dressing her up in nice clothes. When the two of them make wishes, Ondine wishes for Annie to get well. Circus wishes for Ondine to stay. She doesn&apos;t want to be seen and he hides her in an isolated cottage once occupied by his late lamented mother.\n\nThe plucky, smart, and over-imaginative young Annie (Alison Barry) goes to the library and studies up on selkies. She rolls around in a wheelchair that gets stuck in the water at one point. While she&apos;s the most threatened -- she could die at virtually any moment -- Annie is, paradoxically, the strongest person around. The wheelchair she has to travel in hides that her feet are planted firmly on the ground. She&apos;s also like a sea-nymph herself, surviving life on earth uncertainly, only by constant dialysis sessions. Of course Stephen Rea is here, and this time he&apos;s a Catholic priest. Circus goes to him for confession, but not quite confession: he seems to confuse his sessions with the good Father with AA meetings. These are moments of contemplation, as are, perhaps, Circus&apos; attempts to tell Annie a fairy tale based on what he&apos;s actually experienced, but there&apos;s a feeling that events are moving forward rapidly and strangely. &quot;Curiouser and curiouser,&quot; Anne repeats, echoing Lewis Carroll. But really things are in a slow drift, till the end comes and they&apos;re rushed to a conclusion.\n\nThat final revelation when bad men turn up may not be so surprising, but what remains of Ondine is its delicacy and sweetness. Ondine herself does seem for a while a creature of the sea, in a very down-to-water fashion. She likes to get wet in the sea. She sets the fashion of wearing thin, wet dresses and she looks great in them, though there&apos;s a voyeuristic note in those scenes, as if she&apos;s just being posed to titillate the audience. The film seems, not for the first time in Neil Jordan&apos;s work, to be more interested in atmosphere than anything else; there&apos;s plenty of that, but not much depth in the characters or the action. Jordan pays good attention to his visuals and brings in the best d.p.&apos;s to help him. That first film was shot by Chris Menges and this one by Christopher Doyle. The appropriately feathery camera-work never strikes a note of Irish Tourist Office cliché. Too bad the images, though soft and blurry, are clearer than the dialogue.\n\n_________________",

It started out pretty good, but then it just became so bad we were laughing the entire movie. Even good actors can&apos;t save cheesy lines. The whole time we just kept saying that Trejo is in his sixties!! Unbelievable. That man is the epitome of the Hollywood dream. From criminal to D movies to great character actor and then starring roles. Awesome! This movie is great to watch Mystery Science 3000 style. We like to try and catch movie mistakes and look up actors while watching every movie. Its fun and funny. Don&apos;t try to make it more than that and you will enjoy it.",

I&apos;ll be honest, I thought this one wasn&apos;t going to be any good and I thought it would be toned down, I&apos;m glad to be wrong this time around. I&apos;m not going to go much into the plot except that it&apos;s simply a reunion as all the characters are here to return, which it what you&apos;d expect coming into this. It&apos;s just as sweet and crude as the previous three. Just like the other films, Seann William Scott is still the best part of the film. The rest of the cast did just as good as they did with the previous films. If you&apos;re a fan of the previous films, you&apos;ll still find something to enjoy. If you never were a fan, this isn&apos;t going to change your mind.",

      "reviewBody": "I approached Vases De Noces with sheer caution, knowing what would lie ahead of me and all the talk surrounding it, it remains as strange, quiet, savage and disgusting. It has scenes that are revolting and ugly, you could beg the film for mercy to end and it still lingers on the screen like smoke. Vases De Noces could be on a category of its own. We see things as bestiality, corophagia, urine-drinking, etc and it does not shy away on what we can do is just stare or just close our eyes. Others have said that it&apos;s disgusting, vile, nasty, and sick and I have to agree that the film is not so enjoyable. \n\nSure all of this could make out that Vases De Noces (aka The *beep* movie) is such a wretched film that could leave you nauseated and would make you not look at an animal for a while, why is there a movie like Vases De Noces around? Was it done to just shock, disgust? Or enjoy? I could say the first two, knowing what I would wouldn&apos;t see. It is a film that has disappeared from out of thin air, nowhere to be found for someone to see and if they did, they shouldn&apos;t. \n\nWhat I found so fascinating is how the farmer lives, he uses hot coals to take baths, prays before he eats, does his business in a portable toilet. Lingers about his farm tending to his chickens or putting dolls on them or just frolicking with his pig.Sure, frolicking with his beloved pig; chasing it around, rolling around the manure,until finally having sex that made me flinch in disgust, it&apos;s not too graphic but weirdly well done.Many reviewers have focus on the content and how tedious it is,never noticing how the sky and landscape shows how the post-apocalyptic the world is. After the pig has died and the Farmer burying himself with the pig, it is lurid.There is an amazing long shot of the black and white landscape fading slowly before the Farmer rises from the pigs grave. A strange but funny scene when the farmer eats and feeds his offspring, the little piglets run over to his plate. Refusing their food only to eat his and again and again he puts them back to their plate only to find them going back to his plate. \n\nThis review will make you think I enjoyed this film,although I can admit that I only enjoyed the cinematography and the isolation of the farmer.Watching this after watching the tedious Nekromantik 2 which went on and went on, I was engulfed from the loneliness of the farmer.Like the first original Nekromantik, the hero kills himself after it&apos;s horrific lifestyle in a very enigmatic way.Not much things are explained and I don&apos;t mind at all. I settle in giving Vases De Noces three stars out of four or a 6 1/2 out of 10, Not to saying I hated it or loved it, all I could tell you is don&apos;t watch it.",

There&apos;s no possible way a novel of the length and complexity such as &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; can be done justice to by the cinema, even given 145 minutes.\n\nThis 1959 Hollywood version deserves full marks for summarizing and depicting the plot faithfully, but since so much of the essence of the book is missing one cannot help feeling the pointlessness of the entire exercise.\n\nDirector Richard Brooks manages to sustain the emotion intensity of the piece, keeping the proceedings on an intimate scale, (David Lean no doubt would have blown it up to epic proportions). The cast are largely satisfactory with Yul Brynner is at his charismatic best as Dmitri and Claire Bloom is spot on as Katya. Iridescent Maria Schell is far too genteel for the earthy Grushenka, a part Marilyn Monroe somewhat misguidedly felt she was born to play, according to Hollywood lore. Lee J. Cobb tends towards hamming it up and an almost unrecognizably young William Shatner is a pleasant surprise as the mystically inclined Alexi.\n\nWhile there is some enjoyment to be gained from this movie, one can only wholeheartedly offer the recommendation  read the book.",

Just sit, relax let you mind wonder along the story. Especially if you have the privilege to have been in contact with rural setting and the benefit of a long life and can remember the days where things were simple, natural yet not so easy. I think then you&apos;ll enjoy that journey with this nomadic family where everyday life is moving together with the change of times with unavoidable anxious feeling for the invasion of a modern world. I too remember life with 15 milking cows in the East of France, and even earlier on &quot;minding&quot; grazing cows somewhere in open spaces as if time would stand still and i&apos;d never grow older than 10! But here the story is seen from the young children eyes, their loving and concerned parents and older people who seem beyond concerns and more resigned to the grandeur of life. Some comments speak much of symbols in this story. Yes they are, but only if you want to take notice of them, else let yourself go with the gentle tide of the story. It needn&apos;t to be too intellectual unless you enjoy the extra. I hate giving points but feel that most would enjoy this work. MB"

From romance to friendship, dancing to fighting, this French movie bring back good souvenirs of our childhood. It had been a while since I saw such a feel-good movie filled with sunshine and laughters. The characters were well defined and it does not take long before you get a good understanding of them. The dialogs were smooth but sharp, sweet but spicy. Truly a movie with heart and very well directed. Great job from all involved and props to all the young actors. It&apos;s was fun to see Omar Sy who was as good as always and there even was a guy from Quebec which is a plus for me. I strongly recommend it. 8.2/10",

Tey don&apos;t want you to pirate movies but do they care if you pay good money for garbage? I don&apos;t feel sorry for any of the studios.

Because it is not just what she is feeling, but how society (or rather the village she lives in) makes her feel about it. And there is quite some foreshadowing going on, that should be able to tell you where this is going.\n\nAnd it is not an easy movie to watch. Not just because the main woman is so troubled and therefor makes it an uncomfortable watch. But because of how people react and how things spiral out of control. Now all that is quite an achievement for the movie, but it probably will turn people off (no pun intended) with all the nudity. There is even erect penis at display (though no actual penetration can be seen, as far as I could tell, I didn&apos;t really bother checking). So if that makes you feel uncomfortable, be warned. But there is even something worse towards the end happening ... it&apos;s really despicable and there is social commentary. So there is something there - it just could have done with a better packaging, maybe a shorter running time. Overall decent and quite a punch in the gut ...",

      "reviewBody": "There are very few films I have seen that had the power to affect me as deeply as Nobody Knows. As highly as I recommend it, I must also forewarn, that this film has power, some very serious power. To call Hirokazu Koreeda&apos;s Nobody Knows anything less than a masterpiece would be an insult to the story it tells. The craftsmanship we witness here, from the masterful direction to the outstanding performances that the children were able to commit to, are all something of incredible proportions.\n\nNobody Knows, which is a true story, tells of four siblings, ages 5-12, from different fathers, who live in a small apartment in Tokyo. At first, they live in the apartment with their childish Mother who is hardly ever home. With the exception of the oldest, Akira, the mother snuck the children in to keep the rent lower and prohibits them from ever leaving the apartment, even the veranda, for fear of them being seen. The children do not go to school. As they look after each other, all they do is patiently and affectionately wait for their mother to come home.\n\nAs the story progresses, the children wake up one morning to some money on the kitchen table with a note from their mother saying that she&apos;ll be home in a month. As Akira steps up and takes charge of the apartment, the bills, and his siblings, the children still hold hope that mother will be home soon. And then, Nobody Knows hits you like a truck and goes right through you. Complete Abandonment. The smiles diminish and the childish affection for a mother that will never return is gone. Gone to play mother to another family, it is now entirely up to Akira, with money running out.\n\nKoreeda&apos;s direction of the children is exceptional, as if the film was shot entirely candid. The camera-work is sincere, as if we were one of the children stuck in that apartment. There are no gimmicks here, no slide of hand, or post-production miracles. Nobody Knows is raw, and thrives in Koreeda&apos;s ability to capture the distinct personalities of all four siblings, their hopes, and those secretive moments where Koreeda directs the children not for the stories sake, but for the sake of the children being children.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of Nobody Knows is the performances of the four children. All four children, who conjured phenomenal performances, were played by Japanese youths with no film backgrounds. After you see the film, it is likely that Koreeda preferred it this way, tapping into the honesty and energy that such youth had to offer. Their performances are so sincere and beautiful that on several occasions the tears will start to fall, the goose bumps will rise, and your heart will undoubtedly cry out to rescue these children, to grab them in your arms and set them free.\n\nWithout giving too much away, one of the most touching scenes to me, is on Yuki&apos;s birthday, the only thing she wants is to be able to go outside for a walk with her big brother Akira. So when the night comes, she puts on her little bear slippers, an ear to ear smile on her face, and with her hand in her brothers hand, they set her heart free for if not only a night.\n\nNobody Knows is a film that I will never let go of. This film impacted me so much and I found it so absolutely remarkable, that it hasn&apos;t left my mind since it&apos;s viewing. I almost feel that recommending this film just isn&apos;t enough, and all I can say is that I hope everyone gets the chance to enjoy this film for all that it is worth. As sure as it is to invoke emotion, it is as sure to please as a piece of cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw this in Seattle this week as part of Seattle Film&apos;s Global Lens series. To me this felt like someone&apos;s art/film school project. A lot of long drawn out pauses, and pseudo-artistic shots with very little character development. The story was decent enough, with the war in Beirut as a very dim backdrop at best (I was disappointed to not have been drawn into the conflict at all -- there were occasional shots of tanks, and a few scenes filmed in a basement with the sounds of artillery). Had there been a reasonable amount of character development, I might have cared more about what happened in the end. All of the Men in the film seemed to be characterised as selfish and cold, and most of the women seemed helpless (with the exception of the aunt who was an incredibly unlikable tyrant).",

OK, the acting is largly dire -  but is this not a horror movie tradition? The film excels in its MENTAL imagery, not physical: Tiffany&apos;s disturbing visions of babies with their mouth&apos;s sewn shut as Leviathan plays with her fears; Channards violent, acid flashback-style memories... they are all insightful and well-thought out as they deal with that which cannot be tamed easily - the human psyche. Director Tony Randall has a lot to live up to following  Clive Barker&apos;s &apos;87 epic, but he takes the reigns of the story with good grace and presents a slick and progressive tale - although I do agree with the general consensus that the Cenobites should NOT have been humanised.  \n\nAll in all though a great film, fantastic visuals - the fall of Leviathan at the climax has to be one of the most gripping and explosive deaths of a movie monster in horror film history - and one which should have ended the tale."

      "reviewBody": "In 1906, a 700-mile horse race in the Western wilderness is sponsored by a newspaper. The racers include two former Rough Riders (Gene Hackman &amp; James Coburn), a part-time prostitute (Candice Bergen), a punk &quot;Kid&quot; (Jan-Michael Vincent), an aged cowboy (Ben Johnson), a Mexican with a toothache (Mario Arteaga) and an English gent (Ian Bannen).\n\n&quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (1975) was written &amp; directed by Richard Brooks, who said the movie is based on several historical cross-country races subsidized by newspapers and cities from 1880-1910. The most well-known was a 1908 race from Evanston, Wyoming, to Denver backed by the Denver Post with a $2500 prize, which was his main inspiration.\n\nWhile this was a big budget production with a kick-axx cast it&apos;s not often cited on Best Westerns lists, probably because the long race makes it a one-of-a-kind Western that&apos;s not about a suspense-building story, but rather an episodic adventure with character-defining vignettes. Speaking of which, it helps if you utilize the subtitles to keep up with the sometimes mumbled dialogues.\n\nUnfortunately, the escaped convict subplot seems shoehorned into the last act. It&apos;s like Brooks tried too hard to concoct an &quot;exciting&quot; ending, but ended up almost ruining the movie.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot in Nevada (Carson National Forest &amp; Lake Mead), New Mexico (White Sands) and Colorado.\n\nGRADE: C+/B-",

But it is a very effective adaptation of a great story. Where the Wild Things Are is beautiful to watch, the cinematography is spellbinding, while the sceneries, character movements and colours are mesmerising for the visual senses. The soundtrack adds to the mood wonderfully, it never feels intrusive or generic, instead it is a poignant and reflective soundtrack.\n\nThe story is a beautiful and affecting one, with a touch of weirdness perhaps, and the writing is very good that doesn&apos;t jar with the film&apos;s tone. The characters also add to the film&apos;s success, I can understand why people can&apos;t warm to Max but he is a complex character, I found him easy to relate to and is written adeptly. The supporting characters are weird but in a wonderful way, while the voice acting and acting are terrific especially from Max Records who is just exceptional. Overall, a beautiful, poignant and haunting film, depressing it is but that was intentional. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "What marvelous Italian sensibility! Italians have to be muted for drama, but give them comedy and they soar, it&apos;s who they are, who we are in general down South and all over the Mediterranean - boisterous, frivolous, yelling past each other out of some need to stay afloat, lest the silence bogs us down.\n\nThe allegory is of course as obvious as the characters, a shrill rich wife and a grumbling sailor, a communist we&apos;re told, on board her yacht during a cruise get stranded in a deserted island. Of course the dynamics shift - we see how easy and quick it is for him to become a tyrant now that he has the upper hand, how degrading for her to be ordered about. But then sex enters the picture and that changes everything; she&apos;s beaten around, almost raped and comes to love the submission. \n\nAs thin as the politics may be, so much more subversive when it becomes sexual. Rape fantasies are common in men and women alike, no reason to hide, and nothing peculiar about it - sex is after all in a primal way about the swap of power. But here just as about the fantasy is about to be consummated, at the peak of sexual paroxysm, this is the moment the filmmaker chose to have the man pull back and be revealed a delusional fool - she must cherish him as her god and so on.\n\nThe question that looms, a deep deep one, is was it the island? Or is it civilization that obscures? Which of the two shows their true self? Eventually they bond as lovers, but that is based on everything else we&apos;ve seen. Do the limits imposed by being seen and known in public lead into delusions of self? Or does uninhibited freedom? Was it true love or was it a simple desire that found no limits to run up against? Who&apos;s to make all these impositions of truth anyway?\n\nAnd we have to counterpoint all this against the richness of how they hold themselves in each other&apos;s eyes, some of the most expressive eyes in film - it&apos;s perfectly cast anyway, but the eyeplay between the two is marvelous, starting from that moment they share on the deck one night.\n\nSo this is fascinating stuff, about limits of self, about a slippery passion and having no logical truth that can explain beyond it, the only thing it asks is that you don&apos;t be moral about it. I can only imagine it better in Pasolini&apos;s hands, this lover of textures and breezes of air."

They end up befriending a young reporter named April O&apos;Neill, who reads the news on the local TV station, after she is rescued from an attack from The Foot.  Once she is home our shelled friends find that The Foot has captured Splinter, and so must rescue him and face the might of The Foot&apos;s leader -- Shredder! I was already familiar with the cartoon series (that had apparently been censored somewhat on its arrival in the UK for fear that children would copy the martial artistry), so I was a little dubious as to whether this would work in live-action.  Strangely enough, even when I saw it for the first time in 1991, aged 18, I enjoyed it!  It was brilliantly done, Shredder looked particularly menacing (as did his right-hand man Tatsu), and Splinter&apos;s voice sometimes moved you almost to tears, especially with the charming musical score. The martial arts action is quite well done (although Michelangelo did not have his Nunchaku weapon that his comic-book and video game version does), and the dark look of the whole thing suits it perfectly. This is certainly worth a look."

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a saying I heard a long time ago... &quot;The person that&apos;s got everything has nothing&quot; and this movie kind of explains one way of looking at it (in my opinion).\n\nIn a materialistic influenced world we live in it can be easy to fall into how believing happiness and wellbeing comes only from having all the things wealth can bring i.e. the clean cut minimalist house walking out onto the white sand overlooking a beautiful serene sea, a selection of gleaming new sports cars, the tailored clothes etc etc. But I guess for some people who have reached this place/goal in their life have focused on the goal so much that they&apos;ve forgotten where they&apos;ve come from and what they may have been running from.\n\nNow what this gem of a movie does is carefully and meticulously unravel the story of a troubled man in this very situation, dealing with the daemons of his past, the spontaneous difficult decisions he had to make as a boy which has carved this stone cold embodiment of a man on the edge of existence.\n\nNow I&apos;m not going to break down and dissect this film and give a whole rundown on how and why I think this is a great movie but I will say this. The story of a nasty main character (amazing job from both Daniel Craig and Harry Eden) and showing the world that he lives in and lived in by slowly letting the viewer past his metaphorical protective wall while allowing the viewer to piece together how and why he is the way he is, is presented exquisitely.\n\nI don&apos;t want to give anything away on the plot and story but I have to say there where two parts that absolutely blew me away and I&apos;ll just give you a vague hint. One involving a shot of artwork with intention of displaying a contrast of relation between the background and foreground giving an artistic viewpoint on the real subject matter (works on so many levels) and the other being a close up shot which encapsulated a lot of emotion and made my heart just drop.\n\nall in all the whole production was done well, especially the editing (even though it&apos;s obviously apparent they had some great content to work with) and did, for me, what all great stories do, kept me entertained through demanding my full attention and rewarding that attention in the form of an emotional roller-coaster.\n\nLast note: please try not to second guess while trying to predict what&apos;s coming next and how it ends. Just enjoy the story that is being told because it&apos;s been executed very well.\n\nPS: I would have given this a 10 but wanted other readers to take this review seriously as I do love the art of storytelling, especially a good movie and it&apos;s unfortunate that there&apos;s too many marketing teams pushing up star ratings here on IMDb.\n\nThanks for reading my first review and I hope you enjoy &quot;Flashbacks of a Fool&quot; as much as I did.",

      "reviewBody": "The Great Flamarion is directed by Anthony Mann and collectively written by Anne Wigton, Heinz Herald, Richard Weil and Vicki Baum. It stars Erich von Stroheim, Mary Beth Hughes, Dan Duryea, Stephen Barclay, Lester Allen and Esther Howard. Music is by Alexander Laszlo and cinematography by James S. Brown Jr.\n\nBack stage of a vaudeville show and a woman is killed, the perpetrator of the crime escapes up into the rafters. Soon he falls to the ground, and cradled by one of the stage employees, he tells a story of lust, deceit, murder and broken hearts...\n\nThough it falls into a familiar subset of film noir that encompasses the obsessive dupe, reference Criss Cross, The Killers, Scarlet Street et al, Anthony Mann&apos;s film has a most interesting structure. Story is essentially told from the mouth of a dying man, his guilt set in stone, we spin to flashbacks and narration as The Great Flamarion (Stroheim) himself clues us in to the dangers of not following your brain, but what&apos;s in your underwear.\n\nFlamarion, wonderfully essayed by the acid faced Stroheim, is a sharp-shooter on the vaudeville circuit. Once burned in love years previously, he now lives only for his work and he&apos;s friendless, miserable and intolerable to work for. His two assistants are husband and wife team Connie (Hughes) and Al (Duryea) Wallace, he&apos;s a drunk and she&apos;s out for what she can get, and what she wants at this moment in time spells trouble for Flamarion and Al. So begins a treacherous tale as a once wise and closed off man falls hook, line and sinker for a pair of shapely legs young enough to be propping up his daughter.\n\nConnie Wallace (Hughes excellent) is one of the classic femme fatales, she&apos;s not just duping one man, not even two, her capacities for feathering her own nest are enormous. Watching her break down Flamarion&apos;s walls is pitch black stuff, as is Flamarion&apos;s pitiful descent into becoming a broken man, while Duryea&apos;s (another in his long line of great film noir losers) Al roams the edges of the frame as a pitiful drunk stumbling towards doom. The dialogue may not always catch the mood right, but as a story, performed and written, it&apos;s clinical noir.\n\nOut of Republic Studios, there&apos;s obviously budget restrictions, but Mann was a shrewd director in noir circles and crafts a tight and crafty picture. It&apos;s never overtly expressionistic but the all round effect garnered by the lighting techniques pumps the haunting like tale with atmosphere. There&apos;s also a gentle pulse of sexual politics in the narrative, and saucy suggestion as well, with the director asking us to peek under the curtain to spy a world of horny sad-sacks and dangerous females. \n\nIt&apos;s not front line Mann or as good as Scarlet Street (released after The Great Flamarion), but it is a little noir gem. With top performances, pitch black plotting and a message that tells us to never take our eye off the ball, it&apos;s very much recommended to the film noir faithful. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Shallow Grave, the debut film from director Danny Boyle (also from his fellow producer and screenwriter from other films he made in the 90s), has a fatalistic edge to it, but where it will really go is anyone&apos;s guess. It&apos;s practically impossible to identify with these three main characters- Kerry Fox as Juliet, Christopher Eccleston as David, and Ewan McGregor as Alex- as they&apos;re all cynical and sarcastic to the bone, rarely sympathetic, and friends through and through. The latter part might be a little more recognizable in such a very easy kind of story for these characters, who after finding their new roommate dead in his room have to &apos;take care&apos; of the situation. This becomes further complicated, both practically and morally, when a suitcase of money is found from the ex-roomer. This is at the core something of a simple dilemma kind of issue tale that could fit very easily onto a kid&apos;s show (minus all the death of course, as finding-money was also used in Boyle&apos;s film Millions). But Shallow Grave also happens to have the ingredients for a horror film as well as film-noir, tragedy as much as thriller, with bits of pitch-black comedy thrown in for good measure.\n\nOne of the cool, unnerving things about the film as well is how, after a while, you can&apos;t really be sure who&apos;s really sane or not. But even as it is a story of friends, it is more closer to being Eccleston&apos;s movie, as a character who goes through the darkest change out of the three of them. He starts out as the sanest of the uptight middle class three, or at least the most reasonable when the circumstances strike up. But through grisly turns of events, he becomes the most un-balanced of the bunch, and Boyle is able to get with his DP Brian Tufano some really powerful moments visually up in the attic. As further complications go on, it becomes not really a tale of morality but one of keeping a bond that is breaking always. But the psychological turns are made better, and not too circumspect or dumb, by the actors. In truth, some of what the characters decide and then go through is a bit too implausible even for a thematically violent film like this. But it&apos;s a fresh showcase for all three actors for their gifts- McGregor&apos;s Alex seems like a sociopath through most of the film, and his change doesn&apos;t make him more likable but still very intense by the acting. Eccleston has what should be one of the performances of his career as the mild-mannered and then loose-edged flat-mate. And Kerry Fox is good, if a little typical as the lady of the house. Her own role in the film is further complicated by lustful intentions and all that- she could be considered a femme fatale if it were that easy.\n\nAnd Shallow Grave is, above all else, a very good film at style trumping the substance, which itself isn&apos;t that bad as being B-movie fare, to which he would put to best use with Trainspotting. Here I&apos;m reminded of the cinematic freedom and inventiveness taken in such &apos;pulp&apos; matter by first time filmmakers in the 90s, and even in the story&apos;s weakest points (and there are a few in due to logic and the dialog sometimes) it&apos;s never boring. There&apos;s a cringe/funny kind of scene with Alex and Juliet using some new merchandise for some lewd and f***ed up purposes, and it&apos;s filmed in a perfectly amateurish way. And in dealing with the more disturbing subject matter, it helps that Boyle and writer John Hodge only show what is necessary (i.e. some of the &apos;grave&apos; scenes) so that it doesn&apos;t become stale or with that sort of kick needed for the material. By the end, too, as in other noir stories, there is a twist that comes, but it isn&apos;t even much expected as the characters have met their fates. But it has the advantage of not being a cop-out either. Shallow Grave is, when it comes down to it, that splendid of things- a directorial calling card that speaks to his skills with actors (more so in casting to a T), mixing comedy and drama, and hip use of camera-work. Nothing really &apos;deep&apos; or great, but it&apos;s a nifty little midnight movie from merry old England. 8.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "If you have seen earlier movies of Mrinal Sen and had an opinion about those movies and didn&apos;t like it, you must try to see this one. A completely different movie. Love affair between a husband and a wife, between an ex-husband and a wife, affection in a family and a traditional village in India shown completely unique and different way. Traditional use of Tagore songs (very popular among the art film makers of Bengal, India) is also very unique and different. Since there is no copyright on Tagore songs any more, Mrinal Sen has used it very differently and the tune suites the environment; it brings a different meaning to &quot;hope, joy, life, dance, death and birth&quot;.\n\nMuslim minority community of Bengal is shown in this movie. I was afraid in the beginning as I am tired of seeing those riot scenes of India. (for which there is no solution, each religion kills the other and no one listens to their leaders, or do they listen?) But this movie was very different. Even with all the formula elements of a Bengali art film like Tagore songs, village scenes, minority community, a love affair between a wife and someone else etc., its very different, I was never bored.\n\nI was also afraid in the beginning to see the name of only male voice singer..as I don&apos;t like the male voice in Tagore songs any more. However, Srikant Acharya has done an excellent job in these Tagore songs. Superb! After seeing the movie the very first time I am going to rate this movie higher than &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; by Satyajit Ray. I am going to watch it few more times in future (will update this review again).\n\nI didn&apos;t see this movie even nominated in Cannes. Are Cannes folks missing something? Are they following the Hollywood trend these days? thank you for reading so far :-), som.",

      "reviewBody": "The twenty fourth story from the first volume of Brothers Grimm&apos;s &apos;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&apos;, &apos;Frau Holle&apos; may not be one of my favourite stories or fairy-tales, being one that was introduced to me when quite a bit older rather than being one of those growing-up-with stories. It is however a very interesting story from a thematic standpoint and teaches good and important lessons that are valuable and relevant today still. Do like it very much, especially for the titular character who is very memorable and iconic.\n\nDEFA&apos;s 1963 version of &apos;Frau Holle&apos; is one of a number of a fairy/folk tale adaptations made in East Germany, some better and more popular than others but they are worth the look and better done than most fairy/folk tale adaptations, regardless of their age. &apos;Frau Holle&apos; is not one of the best of them, do prefer &apos;Heart of Stone&apos;, &apos;Three Wishes for Cinderella&apos; and &apos;The Singing Ringing Tree&apos; for examples, but it is still nicely done and follows the original closely and with respect.\n\nIt takes time to get going and there are times where it did feel on the stagy side, sometimes feeling more of a filmed stage version.\n\nAlthough suitably spiteful, Katharina Lind overdoes it a little as Pechmarie.\n\nHowever, it is a nice-looking, if very simple, adaptation of &apos;Frau Holle&apos;. The production design is suitably rustic and colourful and didn&apos;t look simplistic, while it is beautifully shot in colour that never looked too drab or garishly gaudy. Budget limitations show at times but not in a way that looks amateurish. The music didn&apos;t feel at odds with what was going on and fitted while not always enhancing.\n\nWriting doesn&apos;t become too cheesy or camp, while being fun enough to stop the treatment of the story from being taken too seriously. When it got going, the story had immense charm and was engaging, it was easy to follow without being too simple and nothing childish or too scary. It is a respectful as an adaptation as is the spirit, even if at times dramatically it could have had a little more kick in spots. Generally it didn&apos;t feel too long, with &apos;Frau Holle&apos; not being as slight as other fairy-tales so there is more story in it, and scenes didn&apos;t feel padded out.\n\n&apos;Frau Holle&apos;s&apos; characters are immensely engaging. Identified every step of the way with Goldmarie and Frau Holle herself is both benevolent and mysterious. Much of the acting serves the adaptation well, especially Karin Ugwoski as Goldmarie with Mathilde Danegger also the embodiment of Frau Holle. Elfriede Florin is an appropriately nasty step-mother and doesn&apos;t overplay too much.\n\nSumming up, a worthwhile watch and a good way to introduce one to the story if one doesn&apos;t know it already. 7/10",

This is a quite well-done film showing the programs of Tarte and Vivant, two Belgian movements. The characters could not better be represented than by the persons themselves. The director did his best to show as much as possible of the main ideas of the two groups. I personnally think it was necessary to show everything, there&apos;s no bad scenes that seem forced or off place in the narrative. I just found myself losing interest at the point the debats between Tarte and Vivant became a bit long-winded. Beyond this point I find La vie politique des Belges to be a quite fine film."

I think the story is great since everyone has been there, and the acting is real, so you don&apos;t feel that these people are just examples in some Lifetime film. I would of given it a higher rating except that during the middle, it slows down, and makes a person lose interest.  So, if you are going to see it, try fast forwarding through the middle for full enjoyment, because not only will you miss the boredom, but you also won&apos;t have to see Martin Short naked.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Captive&apos; is about a group of tourists abducted by al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf from a resort on Palawan in 2001. They were shipped to Basilan in the far south, and then herded through the jungle for over a year. Some paid ransom money calculated on their profession and country of origin, and were subsequently released, some died from strain or disease, some were killed by Abu Sayyaf, some by the army in repeated rescue operations, of which the last (and bloodiest) succeeded.\n\nThe film drew a lot of fire from the press, first of all because it was rejected by both Cannes and Venice, which created a somewhat toxic whiff - after all, Cannes built Mendoza&apos;s reputation with his win for &apos;Kinatay&apos;, so how bad could his first decently budgeted film be? As it turns out, it&apos;s not half as bad as could be expected. Mendoza avoids two mistakes he could have easily made: first of all, the camera isn&apos;t glued to Isabelle Huppert&apos;s face, even though she&apos;s the first star he&apos;s working with; he allows her character to gradually emerge from the group of hostages, which becomes decimated by disease, ransom payments, forced marriages as a shoddy excuse for rape, and deliberate execution. And second, he does not sweeten his barren naturalistic photography one bit because of the scale of the production; &apos;Captive&apos; is every bit as Cinema Verité as his earlier films. If anything, the money allows for some disjointed wildlife intersections, which however fulfill a dramatic purpose when, for instance, a lizard is seen hacked in two by a machete, instead of the head of a hostage being chopped off.\n\nThis kind of film language won&apos;t convince those who have their established ideas about what a Filipino film looks like - and to illustrate how fixated these ideas have already become, another section of the Berlin Festival screened the film industry parody &apos;The Woman in the Septic Tank&apos;. In that context, I would count myself among those who appreciate that Mendoza, who established these conventions, tries to move onwards stylistically.\n\nHowever, the story structure certainly puts the viewer&apos;s patience to test. There&apos;s zero background information about Abu Sayyaf and the domestic conflict in the Muslim populated islands in the south of the country. In one scene, villagers feed hostages and captors alike and receive some money for their troubles, making it seem that they are somewhat regarded as freedom fighters, whereas in reality they also raided and killed Muslim locals. In the film, Islam is used as an &apos;excuse&apos; for criminal actions, which is probably not so far from the disturbed mindset of these people, but leaves room for controversy.\n\nThe photography&apos;s realism makes the differences between truth and fiction appear a bit questionable: Why, for instance, was the American hostage who was later beheaded cast with a Caucasian actor instead of a Hispanic one, as it was the case? Also, the Abu Sayyaf were far more ruthless in their dealings with hostages, negotiators and villagers alike - while their brutality comes across, most of them seem strangely boyish. That Huppert&apos;s character is fictitious may be explained by the logistics of the production, but since much of the story follows real-life survivor Gracia Burnham&apos;s book &apos;In the Presence of my Enemies&apos;, it feels a bit unfair that her character is sidelined in the movie.",

The ensemble cast moves effectively throughout the movie without stepping on one another. There is a sense of comraderie and spirit that is engaging. The cameos of George Carlin and Richard Pryor actually digress from the action and the multiple stories at play. Obviously, this is not an Oscar winner, but it is good fun, sometimes touching, and entertaining from start to finish. It&apos;s also a good look at LA in the 70&apos;s. And, it&apos;s one of the few movies where voice over narration actually works."

This is a blockbuster of an idea that could well be put into practice in the near future. Its notion is horrific but potential in this barbaric world we live in these days.\n\nThe acting is strong and commendable and the pace is good and keeps you wanting more.\n\nIts cliché in places, predictable but in my view is well worth the watch; especially if you wear a tin hat like me! \n\nAll in all a solid low budget thriller that will have you thinking about the future that just might be around the corner for us all.\n\n7/10",

His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power, strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof, For the Moment, Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler, funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. (I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it&apos;s likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special &quot;effected&quot; and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!",

That&apos;s in fact part of its charm, a Star Wars type budget would have killed this film.\n\nThree British scientists who are on a project trying to communicate with other intelligent life forms out in space are about to get the plug pulled from their funding. They&apos;ve got three months to get some results from their radio telescope or the foundation that funds them will cut them off.\n\nOne night working late, the scientists, Zena Marshall, Simon Oates and Stanley Meadows actually achieve a breakthrough. It&apos;s while suffering the presence of auditor Charles Hawtrey from their benefactor foundation. Even the lunch lady Patricia Jones is around. But the scientists get more than they bargain for when they&apos;re teleported to an asteroid where some civilization has left quite a space station outpost to contemplate.\n\nThe space station was put there by some civilization long extinct like the Krells to guard against an invader whose got some space ships heading for earth right now. The premise is similar to the one for The Last Starfighter. \n\nWhat makes The Terrornauts fun and not some total Ed Wood type disaster is the presence of Charles Hawtrey and Patricia Jones. They&apos;re of absolutely no help whatsoever to the scientists except both as witnesses to what transpired and for comic relief to the audience. Hawtrey was on hiatus from the British Carry on series and in his droll fey way keeps the proceedings hysterical. He&apos;s aided and abetted by Jones who even though she&apos;s bewildered by what&apos;s going on, keeps a nice even keel about everything. They play beautifully against the oh so serious scientists.\n\nThe Terrornauts is a real sleeper of a science fiction film, a camp delight something Ed Wood would have liked to have had credited to his name. But just imagine if the scientists had not been teleported and it was just Hawtrey and Jones. Where would the world be then?",

      "reviewBody": "This first talking film version of the venerable Madame X takes a full one-third of its running time to get started as a proper movie. The first 30 minutes suffer horribly from atrocious miking, unbelievably stilted acting and frozen camera placement that was all too common in the early talkie era. It&apos;s as if the actors were on morphine laced with acid and performing under water. The one scene that takes place outdoors in a public park is crudely recorded and more jarring than revelatory in its effect. \n\nWhen the locale finally shifts to southeast Asia the juicy part of the story begins with the star Ruth Chatterton on the first leg of her debauched round-the-world journey to oblivion as the wayward official&apos;s spouse whose life is ruined by an extramarital tryst. Chatterton&apos;s performance careens from laughably, abysmally dated posturings at the beginning to incandescent hyper-realism as she portrays the dissolution and ravages of absinthe addiction and self loathing. It is a brave and even startling tour de force, especially for its time. And the extreme contrast between the awful and the sublime is itself a phenomenon worth observing for its own sake. It speaks to the transition in acting styles that was taking place in the 1920s, a time of deep cultural change. Usually a movie from this era will contain different styles of acting coming from different actors - but here the differences are all within Chatterton herself.\n\nThe rest of the cast simply falls by the wayside, although in the early minutes it is Lewis Stone who registers more strongly, due to his deeper and more mike- friendly voice. Raymond Hackett as Madame X&apos;s clueless son is suitably earnest and sympathetic in his bravado courtroom climax scene. Ullrich Haupt is effective as the con man who befriends the heroine in South America, but Burgess Meredith&apos;s rendition of the same character in the 1966 version was more chillingly repulsive. \n\nToward the end Chatterton&apos;s performance begins to slip back into treacly mode (not helped by the overwrought dialogue), but for about 45 minutes she delivers one of the most entertaining acting jobs of 1929.",

It&apos;s no wonder that someone from Texas does not understand this way of life, but we here, after 50 years of communism do understand it. Drinking, materialism, corruption, bribery, blackmailing, rape etc. These were the basics of our lives for decades and it is so sad to see that there is no improvement in Poland after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The events depicted are very similar to those that would take place in rural Hungary. The movie was quite amusing but very sad at the same time.",

      "reviewBody": "Ever Wonder what could have happened if Peter Jackson and the legendary, Andreas Schnaas had gotten together to co-direct an outgageously morbid splatter-piece (with humorous dubbing) that would impress, if not shock even the most hardened of gorehounds? Me either, but if such a thing had ever happened, such a love-child of exploitation would have no doubt, been named Premutos: Lord Of The Living Dead.\n\nAs it would turn out, Lucifer is not the only fallen Angel, in fact, he&apos;s not even the first. There have been two others. This apocalyptic tale revolves around the first to get a swelled head and turn on God. The Lord of the living-dead, Premutos has been summoned to wreak bloody havoc on humankind, off and on throughout history. \n\nThen there&apos;s Matthias. This poor guy has been plagued with traumatizing visions all week. Every time Matthias gets banged up, he&apos;s temporarily transported to certain era&apos;s involving Premutos, including the middle ages, the crucifixion and World War II. And considering how much the hapless Matthias gets banged up, it&apos;s been quite a week. \n\nThese flashbacks also speak of atrocities of the future, and when Matthias&apos;s homeless-looking/military-enthusiast father throws some book into the equation, Premutos&apos;s, somehow, is able to return to Earth (I never said it was coherent), along with the living dead, leading to the ultimate apocalyptic bloodbath, or at least something similar.\n\nThen there&apos;s the gore, let&apos;s talk about that for a second. I, for one, am extremely impressed. We&apos;re talking non-stop, jaw-dropping gore, not quite as gory as Dead Alive, but what is? Actually, Premutos ain&apos;t all that far off. Probably the 4th or 5th goriest movie I&apos;ve seen. Cheap, and excessive to the point of cheesiness (not unlike the acting), and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. If you consider yourself a gorehound, your collection will never be complete without Premutos.\n\nWhat a swell little movie. Really, just a pitch-black delight, no matter how you look at it. As a long-time collector of the gory and the obscure, finding something this hardcore makes all that searching well worth it. As far as 90&apos;s B-horror goes, Premutos is just about as good as you&apos;re going to find, not that that&apos;s saying much, considering the 90&apos;s was the worst period in B-history, (the dark ages) if you will. For more morbid apocalyptic Horror, Burial Ground or Leif Jonker&apos;s Darkness should do just fine, although, neither are near as much fun as Premutos. I can&apos;t recommend this inept gore-fest enough. 7/10",

The acting is fantastic (absolutely everyone is good) and the sound track is delicious, but there is absolutely no comedy, apart from strangeness linked to the setting and a few gimmicks, (all done in the first 5 minutes).\n\nThe film is even a bit depressing. But, as I mentioned before, I liked it. It&apos;s almost like a strange hallucinogenic trip.",

Linda Fiorentino played perhaps the most despicably rotten, heartless, conniving, using bitch I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of watching. Pullman was great as the reaper of retribution intent on giving evil for evil. Peter Berg may have stolen the show with his total inability to say no to his own destruction. It was hard to believe the abyss of stupidity these 2 dopes had the capacity to plumb. Guess that&apos;s what happens when the little head takes over the thought processes for the big head, eh? The picture started out a little slow but developed into a real blowout with a jaw dropping finale. All the folks got exactly what they deserved. All of them.",

I knew Audie quite well, we used to shoot together at the various &quot;fast draw&quot; contests in CA that were popular back in the &apos;60&apos;s. I can tell you this, anything you saw Audie do on film, he could do for real. He was one of the fastest guns in the movies, &amp; he could do it with real bullets, not just blanks or wax bullets! He became a fine horseman, even riding some of his own horses in his films. Watch for Flying John, his horse that he rode in &quot;Night Passage&quot;. Audie was a much better actor than he was ever given credit for, or allowed to be in Universal&apos;s films.",

Hippies on an island agitate for its independence as a revolutionary state as a journalist and his girlfriend are visiting to cover a political summit; sympathetic towards the rebels, the protagonists get targeted by the heavy-handed forces of conformity.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to imagine this movie getting made anywhere but Yugoslavia so soon after the events of 1968, even though the subversive content here isn&apos;t much more specific a critique than, say, &quot;Duck Soup.&quot; (Which nonetheless got famously banned by Mussolini.)\n\nThe film&apos;s more outre stylistic and plot elements seem a bit constricted by its B&amp;W photography, which cry for garish (even psychedelic) color. You might consider its political satire as being in the same general arena as &quot;The President&apos;s Analyst&quot; (which definitely made good use of color photography), and it has the same kind of parodic yet deadpan attitude towards hippies, &quot;the establishment,&quot; and the genre (espionage, romance, etc.) conventions it uses none-too-earnestly. It&apos;s a movie that doesn&apos;t quite blast off into greatness, but it has a lot of esprit, and a real commitment to its particular set of idiosyncrasies.",

The night scenes were so captivating I felt like I was there again. The subtleties in the script keep you thinking long after it has ended. I easily became emotionally attached To the characters and the general spookiness of it gave it a nice edge. The writer left out needless filler conversation leaving it to the Director to complete the moment. I was a little nervous about seeing Jennifer Beals again but her performance was outstanding. Refreshing to See a film less concerned with fast cuts and cheap fillers but Confident of it&apos;s slow pace and great writing.",

      "reviewBody": "Thirty years later it is hard to imagine &quot;The Story of Adele H&quot; without the then twenty-year old Isabelle Adjani as the title character. But at the time Truffaut&apos;s decision to cast the young French theatre star was very risky. Not because there was any doubt about Adjani&apos;s acting, but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue. Would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful, passionate, and intelligent were rejected? And could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer.\n\nBut Truffaut knew what he was doing because Adjani&apos;s Adele Hugo is 100% convincing. And rather than going for audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over Adele&apos;s self-destructive behavior. Adjani&apos;s breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as Truffaut wants us convinced that the world holds open unlimited possibilities for Adele if only see can let go of her obsession. Adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when Adele&apos;s madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering.\n\nApparently Adele Hugo (Victor Hugo&apos;s daughter) had other issues going on well before her obsessive quest for Lt. Pinson&apos;s love began. Her sister had drowned and her parents had always strongly favored the sister over Adele. She has recurrent nightmares about drowning and sees marriage to Pinson as the only way to escape from her father. Visually, Truffaut&apos;s stays with blacks, browns and blues; with much of each frame filled with shadows; not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little non-fantasy happiness during her life.\n\nThe camera loves Adjani, a good thing as she is on screen for over 90% of the film. She was the youngest nominee ever for best actress. It was the best performance of the 1970&apos;s, probably no one but Adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence. It is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound.\n\nAs Roger Ebert noted: &quot;Truffaut finds a certain nobility in Adele. He quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice: She writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover. He sees this, not as a declaration of love, but as a statement of a single-mindedness so total that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. Adele was mad, yes, probably - but she lived her life on such a vast and romantic scale that it&apos;s just as well Pinson never married her. He would have become a disappointment&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; begins in a purposely disorienting way--a woman walks around her secluded, South American villa, preparing dinner, when the power suddenly goes out. Her husband is returned home by a stranger after his car gets a flat; later, after assuaging his wife&apos;s spastic bouts of unexplained paranoia, the stranger returns with the husband&apos;s spare tire. The husband, wanting to reward the man&apos;s generosity, invites him in for a drink. The wife, who is extremely on edge, escapes the house undetected and steals the stranger&apos;s car, pushing it off a cliff and into the ocean below. After this, the film settles down into a three-character psychodrama of the highest order.\n\nRoman Polanski, a director who can mine tension with a bare minimum of means, uses deliberate lighting, specific camera angles, and a well-paced narrative to create a film where the suspense is endlessly being ratcheted up a notch, often in ways that are quite surprising. The wife, Paulina (Sigourney Weaver), suspects the stranger (Ben Kingsley) of raping and torturing her years ago; her husband, Gerardo (Stuart Wilson), is a lawyer who is enlisted to get the man&apos;s confession. The game of psychological cat-and-mouse that ensues is absorbing.\n\nBoth Kingsley and Wilson fare well in their roles, but it is Weaver who energizes the film. Her performance is absolutely (this deserves all caps) RUTHLESS, filled with moments of raging violence, icy detachment, and degradation (emphasized in graphic recollections of torture); if you thought Ellen Ripley was fearless in the face of the Queen Alien, &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; shows an altogether different kind of tough exterior for the actress. In a way, I was reminded of the graphic revenge that took place in the infamous rape drama &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;; while &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; is superior, it is just as similarly driven (though the rape and torture is left to our imaginations), and its psychological edge, matched with top-drawer performances, moves it further from a &apos;filmed play&apos; and into more visceral terrain. And, as he&apos;s so good at doing, Polanski keeps us guessing till the very end.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Filled with indelible images: The peacock in the middle of the snow, the awesome vision of the ocean liner--and the blind man crying out: &quot;What&apos;s it like, what&apos;s it like?&quot;, the belly-laugh inducing introduction to each of the instructors at school, the beautiful people, the grotesques. Like life itself, the movie can be perplexing and enigmatic, sometimes magical, sometimes, in the face of the political climate and history, frightening as &quot;simple people just trying to live get caught up in the times they were themselves creating&quot;. I don&apos;t think any film I&apos;ve ever seen has so completely captured with such profound insight and simplicity the experience of losing a parent: The visit by the father and son in the hospital in which the mother realizes the awesome finality about to approach, and the son is blissfully unaware in his adolescent &quot;immortality&quot;, and the total feeling of quiet and emptiness as the father sits at the dining room table, formerly filled with joyful, loud, noisy life--now emptier than could have ever been imagined before--this whole sequence comes as a powerful conclusion to a stunning film. With a final coda a la 8 1/2, Fellini embraces the audience, telling them not to worry--memories go on, life goes on, changed, altered forever perhaps, but it goes on, beautifully, enigmatically, magically.",

After that killing accident, Rick does not feel scared or nervous, but HAPPY?!  A few years later, the police suspects Rick of killing a witness and 4 cops in a trial court case. The trail turns into a cat-and-mouse game until the final stand-off.\n\n This movie is deeply emotional, for Rick&apos;s first kill brings a feeling of an addiction as he becomes a threat to the police. It showed how pitted rivals faced against each other, a cop afraid of shooting to kill pit off against someone who won&apos;t stop at nothing to kill. It makes you think whether killing  makes you afraid of being addicted?  Worth considered to check out.",

Plus, the matchbox and subpar effects are great in a kampy way and the star wars &quot;homages&quot; are funny!  It was definitely a show that fit right in on the SOL which kampy in its own way too!\n\nYou gotta love the conflict in this film...Ken and Star Wolves, Ken and Rocky..whereas this ragtag crew become earth&apos;s top defenders.  Do not miss the infamous &quot;forklift&quot; scene and the sequel: Starforce: Fugitive Alien 2.\n\nStill way better than Space Mutiny.",

Even the story to this one wasn&apos;t very good at all, I feel the director and writer which I both blame for this just didn&apos;t care about the story and just wanted to make a crappy movie I guess. \n\nI mean this film could have been good but the idea of Cash Reese being pregnant was stretching credibility, she can&apos;t she is a robot also I feel the sequels got confused on the cyborg/robot thing.\n\nIn the first film, Pearl Prophet was a CYBORG, but she was BORN HUMAN, she was ENHANCED with CYBERNETIC PARTS; Cash Reese is a ROBOT, an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, she is designed to LOOK, FEEL,and even ACT HUMAN. See, not the same thing.\n\nThis movie has it&apos;s small moments but this one is a disappointment, I first seen this with my friend on his laptop, I asked him to download it for me because I could not find it anywhere and my library couldn&apos;t get me it to order, originally I was planing on owning it, but I quickly changed my mind after I seen it. We both felt the same about this film, we didn&apos;t like it that much, he still hasn&apos;t seen Cyborg 2 yet, but he did agree that this one kinda sucked. \n\nOverall, a crappy installment that should of been a lot better. DON&apos;T GET ME WRONG, it did have it&apos;s MOMENTS, and some of the film I DID LIKE as well as my buddy. But tone wise, it had a disappointing ending, and the story wasn&apos;t that well written. I would have been MORE FORGIVING on it if the ending was better. In the future, I might give this film another chance.\n\nI give it a 1/10. It was pretty bad, it had it&apos;s moments but those are few and far between. I hope the forth film &quot;Cyborg Nemesis&quot; will be at least a little better than this one. If your curious about it; you could see it, but proceed with cation.",

      "name": "Small scale for Zhang Yimou, but still well made",
      "reviewBody": "There is no doubt in my mind that Zhang Yimou is one of the world&apos;s finest film makers. He manages to straddle the bounds of both art house and commercialism with his catalogue of works that show a beauty and grandeur that often earns the description &quot;painterly&quot;, whilst also telling a really good story. Happy Times is something of a departure from works like Raise The Lantern and Shanghai Triad, being a fairly realist comedy.\n\nHappy Times (&quot;Happy Times Hotel&quot; on the print) is about a group of &apos;retired&apos; (laid off) factory workers who conspire to hoax a young blind girl. Not as callous as it sounds though, as their intentions are relatively good. The main characters are a 50 year old bachelor (Zhao Benshan) and the blind girl herself, played by newcomer Dong Jie. A small crowd of interesting friends and the gargantuan love interest/stepmother of the leads pad out the cast, which mostly plays out in a couple of small locations - two cramped flats, a sprawling abandoned warehouse, and a delapidated bus.\n\nIt&apos;s very much a character piece, focussing mainly on the relationship that develops between Zhao Benshan and Dong Jie, thrust together under circumstances that neither planned. It&apos;s a tender story... a little bit happy, a little bit sad. Bittersweet I guess, but only slightly bitter.\n\nZhang Yimou forgoes his usual luscious cinematography for quite a naturalistic feel. Apparently he used &quot;hidden cameras&quot; to shoot some of it, but I&apos;ve no idea what that means (maybe the street scenes?). It&apos;s quite a simple piece, a light 95 minutes long, yet still crafted with the dexterity and care that Zhang Yimou always brings to a film. Being a character piece, it is very much dependent on the performances for success - Zhang could coax an oscar winner out of a mannequin, but Dong Jie here is especially good. If I hadn&apos;t seen her walking around the theatre unattended, I would certainly have believed she was genuinely blind (this is not an easy thing to act), and her emotional expression is spot on too. You couldn&apos;t possibly not care for her character, or that of Zhao Benshan.\n\nThe movie might be quite &apos;slight&apos; in Zhang Yimou&apos;s filmography - it&apos;s unlikely to win any oscars for him, but it is a nicely made movie that I think everybody can enjoy.",

He made a golden name after this film and he presented a spirit of Robert Taylor, Clark Gable , Tayron Power........ etc. If he completed his steps in Hollywood he will make a diamond name in the international cinema but he preferred returning to his home England to make many films in his country and to serve England with his experience he gained it from Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "Gerhard Polt plays Ferdinand &apos;Ferdl&apos; Weitel, an archetypical, working-class proletarian who falls for the lure of insurance salesman Herr Von Mehling. Von Mehling cons Weitel into signing up for eight insurances but Weitel realizes too late that the costs would not only eat up his monthly budget but that most insurances don&apos;t even apply to him. Having only a few days to cancel the contracts and this being the chaotic time of &quot;Kehraus&quot; (the Bavarian version of carnival), Weitel must now go on an odyssey into the heart of the Insurance business. There he meets characters that can only be found in real life: the petty, disgruntled office workers; lazy, scheming and jealous to the last man (and woman) and the aristocratic, champagne and caviar slurping yet no less petty managers that inhabit the top floors. And there are many the &quot;seemingly&quot; bitter people who inhabit the city of Munich. Von Mehling is able to elude Weitel during office hours, leaving Weitel with the only choice that he&apos;ll have to find the insurance salesman in the annual &quot;Kehraus&quot;-party. This party will be for Weitel what the odyssey was to Ulysses: either perish in the straits of Scylla and Kharybdis or win his Penelope (and have those pestering insurances cancelled).\n\n&quot;Fast wie im richtigem Leben&quot; was the name of the much awarded Satire with which Polt started his career – &quot;Almost like in real Life&quot;. The word &quot;Almost&quot; was a euphemism. The characters that Polt shows come straight out of life; over-played reflections of characters that will surround you if you happen to live in Munich. &quot;Bürgertum&quot; is the German word for both citizens and blue collar workers; most &quot;Bürger&quot; are proud of being &quot;Bürger&quot; – but it can also be used as an insulting term.\n\nPolt, in corporation with long-term partner, the director Hanns Christian Müller, has assembled a cast that consists of the finest (South)-German humorists, character-actors and comedians: Bruno Jonas, Dieter Hildebrandt, Karl Obermayr, Gisela Schneeberger, Jochen Busse. Hans-Günter Martens, to mention only a few – all cream of the crop.\n\nPeople not familiar with the &quot;Monaco of the South&quot; might have a difficult time understanding what the joke is all about. As almost all things Polt, this is an insider joke. If you&apos;re from the area and have an interest in intellectual satire, chance is that you&apos;re a Polt fan already. However, if you plan to visit Munich, you might well view this as a humoristic anthropological study about people who can laugh at themselves, despite of themselves. Hey, there is an Oktoberfest every year and the Hofbräuhaus is open every day; go for the pork knuckles and the white sausages; however, if you&apos;re a carnival fan – go to Cologne or Rio de Janeiro instead.\n\nPure brilliance and one of the finest satires ever produced in Germany – just don&apos;t call it Germany when in Bavaria – we are the &quot;Freistaat Bayern&quot;! God bless his royal highness, King Ludwig II from Bavaria! 10 from 10.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Dare&apos; is pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a low-budget indie film: Lazy direction and pretentious storytelling. The standards for indie films are pretty low and this movie is one of those movies that does nothing to change that.\n\nEvery character pits him or herself into the perfect mold of dramatic archetypes (minor roles included). The female lead, Alexa, played by a modest Emmy Rossum, is your typical high school overachiever who breaks out of her shell after a moment of foreseeable clarity. Playing a character that&apos;s easy to hate, Emmy works well with the distasteful card she was dealt. Ashley Springer&apos;s character Ben, however, doesn&apos;t get the benefit of the doubt. The unyielding character is completely unlikable throughout the whole movie and he falls victim to being portrayed by an inconsistent actor. Johnny Drake, the biggest cliché of film history, is the only likable character. Zach Gilford shows range in his acting abilities by breaking away from his awkward roles to play the &quot;bad boy&quot; with a heart of gold.\n\nEverything about this movie reeks of presumptuous &quot;raw&quot; perspectives of teen life and sexuality. Unfortunately, the unapologetic principle that drives the plot forward isn&apos;t enough to save it from the dull progression, simple dialogue and contradictory character development. The writer, David Brind, gives me the impression that he wrote this script overnight with help from a 13 year old companion of his.\n\nThe film is directed by Adam Salky, who&apos;s lack of any relevant experience is evident. The atmosphere of the film is nonexistent. The characters had might as well been in subspace. Salky does absolutely nothing to build an environment for the viewers. Mid-shots are as close as we get to a setting. The worst part is that the movie tries to feed off that false feeling of genuine temperance with its weary direction. It didn&apos;t work.\n\nI do, however, applaud Brind for having the courage to portray sexuality in ways that mainstream writers are scared to (even in today&apos;s more open-minded society). Unfortunately, all applauds come to an abrupt pause as the credits roll. The ending is yet another &quot;profound&quot; attempt at open-endings. Don&apos;t get me wrong. I don&apos;t always need everything wrapped together with a pretty little bow but there&apos;s only so many gaps that a viewer should fill on his own, don&apos;t ya think?",

The enthusiasm he shows for his many schemes to combine occupational stimulation for the patients with fund-raising for the home is infectious. The restless, driven nature of his character contrasts sharply with the sleepy surroundings of this rural backwater. Paounov&apos;s delicate touch allows the patients to emerge as rounded characters with real dignity, whilst I warmed to the self-deprecating humour of Georgi and his colleagues. There are moments of real humour in what could have been a grim story - the gritty reality of mental health provision in post-communist Bulgaria. Much of the humour comes when Georgi&apos;s strong conscience juggles the professional and financial requirements of his circumstances. The over-riding message is of the indefatigable human spirit - this charming film will leave you thoroughly uplifted.",

The larger family all have their pieces to add to this bubbling pot of individuals who all seem to have significant parts to play as the principals go through the steps of their routine. Not to be overly trite about the metaphor but speaking of dance it plays a larger than expected role in the movie or at least to me.\n\nThis is a lovely movie and one that should be watched by any person whose mind is stable enough to appreciate good story telling without the need for guns, killing and the mindlessness of the normal Hollywood dross.",

      "reviewBody": "Low budget horror. What else can I say...some are good and some are just plain bad. Now there are different levels of bad...there&apos;s the bad that&apos;s good (like House of the Dead)and then there&apos;s bad that should be shot into the sun (like Home Alone 3,Good Boy). I&apos;ve always been a big fan of low budget horror and I&apos;ve been lucky enough that all the films I&apos;ve checked out have been a real treat. I&apos;ve only been burnt once and I was afraid that Ghost Lake might be like that one. I wasn&apos;t really in the mood to watch anything, but I heard the Ghost Lake started with the lead going topless and I decided to at least watch that part until I figured out something else to watch. Well, I ended up watching the whole movie and liked it very much.It&apos;s a good little film with a good plot,some good effects and good music. But the only real problem is that some of the actors seemed off at times which really annoyed me at times.Some of the plot seemed to get lost during the explanation scene and while you trying to figure out what the hell they&apos;re talking about they&apos;re already moved on. If they would cleared up alittle more on the history of the lake(which is a real place) then I would have saved me some stress.Now the movie does have a lot of story to it, there&apos;s no real ACTION to speak of so those who expected a non stop action ride better go watch Dawn of the Dead (04) again. Because this film is more about the story, the history and the ghost are really there to serve the plot then being the plot. But if you stick it out and forgive afew laughable moment, the off acting moments(I swear all of the old people in this movie were dreadful), then you&apos;ll like this one. A big plus for for me is having the lead,Tatum Adair, naked is always a big plus for me. Could it have been better? Yes. But I think they did good with what they had."

Therefore he digs himself deeper when he starts acting like his a cop outside of the dance training to impress this lady. &quot;Off Beat&quot; is a pleasurably breezy, light-hearted 80s romantic comedy with plenty of familiar faces on show. The cast are indeed great, with Judge Reinhold and Meg Tilly in the leads. For me, the adorable Tilly is always a delight to watch, but she still can pack a punch. James Tolken sure finds out. A tolerable Reinhold is gawky, but likable as Gower. Loved the scenes he shares with the wise-cracking Cleavant Derricks, who plays his friend Abe. The sequence with them arguing in a change room and Derricks&apos; final word to the shop assistant is priceless. Most of the lively support roles with character actors are spot-on and do over-shadow the leads. Harvey Keitel and Victor Argo might only have small roles towards the end, but their chemistry together was hilarious with Argo truly stealing the show. Austin Pendleton as a gun shop salesman is quite humorous too. Rocket launcher for home protection?! Joe Mantegna is a true live-wire as fellow-cop / ex-boyfriend of Tilly&apos;s character. Also dependably showing up is Mike Starr, Amy Wright, John Turturro, Penn Jillette, John Kapelos, Anthony Zerbe and Fred Gwynne. But the list still goes on. Quite a macho lot, where the script seems to sarcastically tear apart at this bravado and the dialogues are fun in nailing it. Even questioning one&apos;s own comfort, by taking a chance outside that familiar zone. Its bubblegum soundtrack gives it much added bounce. Commonplace, but endearing comedy. \n\n&quot;I won&apos;t hurt them. I&apos;ll kill them. &quot;",

Its combination of images, scenery, characters, and themes provides plenty of things to think about, more than could be assimilated in any one viewing. Bergman is one of the very few film-makers who had the knack for making this kind of feature coherent and memorable at the same time.\n\nThe story could hardly be more efficient. The very small cast and the tight scenario place a premium on the writing, acting, and photography. The characters have a good balance of similarities and differences that makes for a wide range of possibilities, and the story makes good use of them. The seaside setting is used nicely, with the beautiful scenery and thematic images both complementing the story. The old shipwreck is skillfully worked into a psychologically harrowing sequence.\n\nThe setting is combined with the family relationships, biblical allusions, philosophical questions, and much more, to raise a wide range of interesting and thoughtful questions. Although &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; does not feature the extensive use of unusual imagery found in Bergman features like &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; or &quot;Persona&quot;, or the dream sequence from &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;, in its own way it is also effective."

      "reviewBody": "Come to think of it, quite a lot of things were &quot;blood-stained&quot; in the wicked world of 70s Italian cult cinema! I&apos;ve seen films that dealt with bloodstained orchids, shadows, butterflies, and now even a full lawn! The title, by the way, refers to a quote spoken by one of the female leads early in the film already. When she spots a field full of poppies/roses, she states: &quot;Oh, so beautiful, it looks like a blood-stained lawn&quot;. That also pretty much gives you an idea of how random this entire film is. I have very mixed feelings about &quot;Il Prato Macchiato di Rosso&quot;, and I can&apos;t help feeling somewhat disappointed because Giallo &amp; Euro-Cult are my favorite exploitation sub genres and this title stood on top of my watch list. The basic plot is terrifically twisted, the main characters are joyously eccentric, and many sequences are truly beautiful to gaze at, but still the overall feeling is that the full package could have been a lot better. Style is clearly predominant over substance here, whereas the true Italian masters of cult cinema (Bava, Argento, Lenzi, ...) always managed to keep the two in perfect balance. Writer/director Ricardo Ghione obviously isn&apos;t one of those masters. It already begins with the opening credits. Teo Usuelli&apos;s music is phenomenal and moody, but there are far too many images of one and the same sunset from various camera angles. Did Ghione already run out of inspiration at this point? The next half hour is familiar, if you&apos;re into Italian cult that is, but still very well-handled. The sleazy-looking Alfiero picks up a variety of lower-class drifters (a drunk, a prostitute, a fortune-teller and a hitch-hiking hippie couple) and brings them to the villa of his sensual sister Nina and her eccentric husband Dr. Antonio. The latter apparently has a wardrobe full of oversized and ludicrously colored bow-ties and drags a bizarre looking machine that looks like a robot around the house. The guests are treated to copious amount of booze, drugs and orgies, but it&apos;s abundantly clear that these crazed aristocrats have vicious plans for them in store. Meanwhile, an ambitious UNESCO-agent (I don&apos;t have a slightest clue what the link with this organization could be) tracks down the origin of bottles with human blood that are being sold as prestigious red wine. &quot;Il Prato Macchiato di Rosso&quot; is a frustrating film in the sense that you know what is going to happen, and you also really look forward to some nasty bloodshed and misanthropy, but it just isn&apos;t coming. Only the climax is rewarding in terms of gore and thrills, but the disappointment already sunk in too deep by then. Although, I have to say, it rejoiced me to finally see that blood-draining robot device in action! If the overload of dialogues doesn&apos;t give you a headache, Enzo Tarascio&apos;s increasingly flamboyant bow ties certainly will. Beforehand, I was sure that &quot;Il Prato Macchiato di Rosso&quot; would have entered at a reasonably high position in my Giallo top 100 (albeit not an actual giallo), but I honestly can&apos;t give it a good rating. It does receive one extra bonus point, however, for that utterly coolest (yet completely irrelevant) film poster with the blond beauty incorporated into the deep-sea monster.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; has always been among my favourite fairy-tales, Charles Perrault and Brothers Grimm versions, the story and characters charmed me as a child (through reading the story and various adaptations) and get just as much out of it now. Same with the Disney film, a personal favourite of mine, and Tchaikovsky&apos;s ballet, one of the quintessential ballets.\n\nDEFA&apos;s 1971 version of &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; is one of a number of a fairy/folk tale adaptations made in East Germany, some better and more popular than others but they are worth the look and better done than most fairy/folk tale adaptations, regardless of their age. &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; is charming and nicely done with a good deal in its favour, anybody who is familiar with any of the other DEFA fairy-tale films and liked them should find what they liked about them will be present here. As someone who is familiar with and has liked them, that was the case with me watching this.\n\nIt is a little draggy and stagy in spots, particularly when the prince is introduced. Burkhard Mann makes an already fairly bland character in the story blander.\n\nWhile the music score is nice enough on its own, part of me felt like the more modern touch to it didn&apos;t fit and dates the film a bit.\n\nHowever, &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; looks pleasing. The sets are simple and sparsely detailed, but are cleverly used and are still not hard on the eyes. The costumes are more interesting and are very colourful, the best thing about the film visually, and it&apos;s all complemented beautifully by the photography and lighting, the latter of which actually making the sets more interesting than they are. Walter Beck directs with a sure and loving hand.\n\nWriting doesn&apos;t become too cheesy or camp, while being fun enough to stop the treatment of the story from being taken too seriously. When it got going, the story had immense charm and was engaging, it was easy to follow without being too simple and nothing childish or too scary. It is a respectful as an adaptation (closer to Grimm than to Perrault) as is the spirit, even if at times dramatically it could have had a little more kick in spots. The strong message that the film has is either going to intrigue people or perplex others. More the former with me, and thought it brought some dimension. Also dimensional was the film&apos;s portrayal of the economy and the very different and very interesting portrayals of the Evil Fairy, or more the 13th fairy, and the King.\n\nJuliane Korén enchants in the title role, bringing a lot to a difficult character to not make dull, and while Vera Oelschlegel is the most beautiful &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; Evil Fairy (tending to be portrayed as ugly) imaginable you feel the character&apos;s menace but also hurt. Helmut Schreiber provides one of the most interesting &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; kings, the complete opposite to the character&apos;s usual portrayals including in the original story but portraying him this way it makes the Evil Fairy&apos;s hurt more understandable.\n\nAltogether, good. 7/10",

Was it &quot;Wizard of OZ&quot;? I had to dig deep in my &quot;sub concious&quot; to reconstruct the title of that movie begging to find it and succeeded after hours until the title &quot;re-apreared&quot; in my memories: Freak Orlando! Where can those original movies be found in theses days? This time I saw the movie with different eyes. Like a rediscoverd yewel which it is. I even bought Ulrike Ottingers corresponding Book to try and understand the thought process of her. This movie, though being part of a thematic trilogy stands for it&apos;s own I think and there are at least 2 ways one can recieve that film. The one is to try and grasp an intellectual dimension with all the philosophical and above all mythological aspects. The other one, which I even prefer, is to just falling into trance, allowing oneself to regress to a mythological level! This is where the magic unfolds the real potential. Thank you Ulrike Ottinger for such a great gift!",

While walking she sees a murder take place and is attacked by the &quot;Tear-Jerked Jack&quot; serial killer. After falling off a bridge she wakes up as the lone survivor. She also wakes up with a disease called face-blindness, a condition which affects you from recognizing any faces...even your own. Lately it seems like the lower budget movies are much better then the big blockbusters. This one is no exception. While this movie started to repeat itself to the point of being annoying it was still tense and keeps you interested and watching through out. Jovovich is becoming a very good actress and she continues to build upon what she did in &quot;Stone&quot;. A pretty original idea that if it weren&apos;t for the repetition of the problem would have been an excellent movie. That said even with the repeating this is still a very good movie that is very much worth seeing. Overall, a surprisingly good and tense thriller that deserves more of an audience that it will get. I give it a B+.\n\nWould I watch again? - I might, just to see if I can catch the clues."

      "reviewBody": "This film is also known as Sundance and the Kid in the U.S. release. Starting as early as the 1970&apos;s most Euro-Westerns started going downhill in quality and budget. So Italian producers started combining the usually dramatic Spaghetti Westerns with comedy and later in 1970&apos;s with martial arts! This film, Sundance and the Kid, is just plain awful in everything from the acting to the screenplay. This turkey was cranked out to compete with the more original Spaghetti Western comedies with Italian actors Bud Spencer and Terence Hill such as Boot Hill, They Call Me Trinity, Trinity is Still My Name..etc. and also perhaps to certain extent the quality U.S. film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid with Robert Redford and Paul Newman which is recommended if you want to see a quality made comedy-western.\n\nIronically, in my opinion, Italian directors made the very best westerns and the very worst westerns. On most all these Spaghetti Western-Comedies everything from the title of the movie to the names of the Italian actors, directors and sometimes even the production crew would change their names to American names and add awful English dubbing all designed to sound more American so it would sell better. In Spaghetti Westerns everything in fact is made in Italy but to make $$$ they had to make it look like an American made western as much as possible...but sometimes failed miserably as in this movie.",

Anyone who has played critic and mercilessly panned or trashed this movie is taking this romp and themselves way too seriously. That said, if you are looking for a way to spend about an hour and a half immersed in pure mindless satirical comedy, this will do nicely. The movie is a spoof of almost any major movie genre you can name with each scene extracting laughter, while setting up a gag for the next. Similar to the Scarry Movie, Naked Gun, and Airplane franchises,a number of well known actors at that time (but not Leslie Nielsen)lent their talents to producing this very funny film parody. Sure, the plot is predictable, the jokes are cheesy, and the overall vibe is cult classic, but this particular recipe works so well that at times, the movie becomes a parody of itself. My wife and I first watched this movie about 10 years ago on late night HBO plus a couple of times after that, and I have to say it gets funnier each time.",

Anyone with just one romantic bone in their body will enjoy the girl boy interplay, especially if you like science fiction (as I do).  The unusual pet they bring with them adds greatly to the story. The two &apos;alien&apos; girls are cute, the effects are quite good and Keenan Wynn, in his 174th movie, his last role, plays a very likeable and understanding, openminded grandfather. I found it to be great fun and when I realized today that someone really tried to badmouth it badly, thought I had to give that a counter. It is not a cerebral piece, but most movies aren&apos;t.  I am happy that I found it because I have never seen any advertising for it, which I found somewhat surprising. Also, it is something that kids can enjoy with its wholesomeness."

      "reviewBody": "An overly cheerful documentary about bisexuality that is more celebratory than informative. The documentary has you believe that there&apos;s a revolution going on, people are changing their minds about bisexuals and people are happy and comfortable with the fluidity of their sexuality. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the case, but if you ask many people, bisexuality is either an anomaly or non-existent. This doc doesn&apos;t touch on this issue except to say that times are changing and look at all the happy bisexuals out there! The overly manic joy of this doc signals something of an attempt from the participants and the documentary filmmakers to convince themselves and everyone else that bisexuality is great and accepted by a lot of people.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say there&apos;s aren&apos;t many happy bisexuals out there, and god knows there needs to be more positive attitudes of bisexuality beyond &quot;the exotic slut who can&apos;t choose a side.&quot; But the glossing over of the negative aspects of bisexuality (the stereotypes, the suspicion, lack of support, invisibility etc) somehow decreases the film&apos;s credibility as an informed source of information on bisexuality. But I suppose every Queer segment of the population needs its cheerleaders in film, and if it makes bisexuals feel welcome and OK about their own sexuality, then it serves a purpose I can&apos;t fault it for. Just be aware that this doc isn&apos;t exactly the most thorough investigation of the subject matter.",

      "reviewBody": "A decidedly lighter tone lingers in Tomas Milian and Umberto Lenzi&apos;s next pairing after the dark and demented MILANO ODIA. This time around, Milian plays Rambo, a drifter who rides on a motorcycle from town to town teaching things to kids and reluctantly getting involved in anti-gang activities. Once his goofball security guard friend gets killed after snooping around a little too close to a kidnapping scheme, Rambo decides to hatch his own Yojibo-like plan to get all the local gangs to kill each other. However, they unexpectedly prove slightly smarter than you&apos;d expect and end up teaming up to fight together against our hero, albeit with no better results than they&apos;d have otherwise.\n\nRight from the get-go, I knew it was going to be good just judging by the opening credits and how many of the usual &quot;Euro-Henchmen&quot; receive top billing. Riccardo Petrazzi, Adolfo Lastretti, Bruno Di Luia, Mario Novelli, Benito Pacifico, Claudio Ruffini, Giuseppe Castellano, and Luciano Pigozzi would go on to make type-cast careers as henchmen and goons throughout the rest of the 70&apos;s owing largely to how well this movie worked out. Even Antonio Casale, the &quot;Brion James&quot; of Italian 70&apos;s crime movies, pops by to lend us another sweaty, ugly face for our hero to beat to a pulp and put a bullet in. Sadly we&apos;re missing only Nello Pazzafini, Biagio Pelligra, Bruno Corazzari, any Dell&apos;Acqua&apos;s, Peverello&apos;s, or Sal&apos;s Borghese and Billa. Toss in a Sergio Smacchi and our henchman reunion would be complete.\n\nWith all the potential and solid cast of villains for Rambo to beat up and shoot, the film doesn&apos;t quite hit the high notes that later films like VIOLENT NAPLES or ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH would the next year. There&apos;s a distractingly silly Micalizzi score and the plot contains enough holes and slow spots to take this down a notch. Best for genre completists or those interested in seeing the true genesis of Milian&apos;s later &quot;Nico Giraldi&quot; character. Notable mostly for a demented scene in which a female character gets unintentionally beaten to death by a gang of clueless hit-men.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Abenteuer in Wien&quot; from 1952 should be regarded as one of the best film noirs produced in Europe and could compete with the best film noirs from the US. There is also an American version of this film with just a few actors changed under the name of &quot;Stolen identity&quot; where the soundtrack is in English. &quot;Abenteuer in Wien&quot; is a very difficult film to get hold of. The Austrian Film Archive issued some years ago a DVD which is of very good quality but I doubt that it is much known outside Austria/Germany. There are elements of the film which reminds of Hitchcock but in my mind this film is superior to many Hitchcock&apos;s films, as this film has also a poetic quality seldom found in Hitchcock&apos;s films . This film is both entertaining, funny, dramatic and have a fantastic atmospheric beautiful photography capturing Vienna five years after the war. Anybody enthusiastic about &quot;Third Man&quot; and its Vienna locations should not miss this film. The action take place during 12 hours during New Year&apos;s Eve in Vienna. The plot is very ingenious and all bits of the puzzle come nicely together. All actors are outstanding. There is no overt violence and the only shot fired is not even heard due to pneumatic drills in the reconstruction of the city after the bombings. There are fantastic scenes of New Year&apos;s Eve celebrations mingled with a chase in the labyrinth parts of Vienna which spins out to the bombed parts of the city. There is a very original touch of the movie like the murderer planning his deed while rehearsing Schuman&apos;s piano concerto in Musik Verein. In contrast the humble surroundings of the unfortunate taxi driver working without identity papers in the war torn city. By pure chance he gets involved in this murder plot. There are remarkably actors even in minor parts lasting just a few minutes which give a special colour and feeling of the film . The drunken New Year&apos;s Reveller with the balloon is a revelation lasting only a minute. These were hard times in Vienna with much of the population living of tips and bribes .There are fine vignettes of bureaucracy reminding of the old Empire I have not seen the American version of the film which seems to have only the main actors slightly changed but I doubt that the original can be surpassed. It seems almost sacrilegious that Viennese population should speak English instead of Viennese German, which is part of this picture&apos;s great charm. The director Emil Reinert died only a year after the film but his master piece deserves to be much more well known."

One minute it&apos;s the Czech Republic and then there is reference to how this disaster gives the US access to the Ukraine and then within, let&apos;s say an hour, they are surrounded by seemingly US troops already set up with a huge camp!  It&apos;s as coherent as a 3 year old&apos;s story. I have so much difficulty that anyone involved in this, from the producers to the actors, read this before getting involved? What about the director? It&apos;s just so horrible.",

Alice Cooper played the role good as hell, and the feel of the movie reminded me of movies I watched growing up. It&apos;s pretty easy to tell that it&apos;s an Italian director, but that&apos;s not bad, cause they can usually make a movie visual in a way that Americans can&apos;t.\n\nThe werewolf-look might not be the best around, but they did what they could with what they had. By showing it as little as possible, but still showing it, they made it seem like it looked cooler than it probably did.\n\nI&apos;m a huge werewolf fan, a 80&apos;s horror fan, Alice Cooper fan, gore fan, and a fan of a lot of other stuff in this film, and I wasn&apos;t let down. (Don&apos;t let the &quot;gore fan&quot; part trick you though, it&apos;s not a gory movie, but it has a couple of blood scenes) 7.5/10 (Giving it 8 on the vote above)",

      "reviewBody": "Although the closing titles contain the standard &quot;all characters are fictitious&quot; disclaimer, the scriptwriter Julian Mitchell has never denied that his main character Guy Bennett is a thinly-disguised portrait of Guy Burgess, one of the notorious Cambridge spy ring who acted for Soviet Russia. The film is mostly set in an English public school during the 1930s, based on Eton where Burgess was educated. (What shocked British society most about the spy ring was not so much the treachery of its members as the fact that most of them were from well-off Establishment families and educated at the country&apos;s most prestigious schools).\n\nAt the heart of the film is the friendship between Bennett and another student, Tommy Judd. Although they are very different in personality, they are drawn to one another because both, in their own way, are rebels against the system. Judd, a committed Marxist, is a rebel with a cause who despises the school and all it stands for. Bennett is a rebel without a cause whose attitudes are rather contradictory. He can see the absurdity and hypocrisy of the public school system and of the Establishment in general, but still wants to benefit from that system. His greatest ambition is to become a &quot;god&quot;, school slang for a senior prefect, regarded as the school&apos;s social elite. Much of the plot revolves around the machinations of various senior pupils to achieve this coveted distinction; Judd is virtually alone in disdaining it. At this stage Bennett is not actually a Communist; when Judd quotes Lenin&apos;s attack on Karl Kautsky, spouting a lot of Marxist jargon in the process, Bennett replies &quot;Oh, that&apos;s bad!&quot;, but in a sarcastic tone of voice which implies that he neither knows nor cares what Judd is talking about.\n\nBennett is also trying to come to terms with his homosexuality. He is engaged in a sexual relationship with another boy, James Harcourt, and there are indications that he has engaged in similar behaviour with others. The school&apos;s attitude to homosexuality, in fact, is fairly schizophrenic. Bennett and Harcourt are by no means the only pupils involved in gay relationships; indeed, another boy in Bennett&apos;s house has recently committed suicide after being caught in flagrante with his lover by a teacher. The greatest concern, however, of the staff and most of the prefects is the need to avoid scandal; gay relationships are quietly tolerated provided they are kept discreet. When one prefect, Fowler, attempts to crack down on homosexuality, motivated by Puritanical religious zeal, he makes himself very unpopular with his fellows, who fear that he might uncover things best left hidden. Bennett represents a challenge to this system of organised hypocrisy, not because he is gay but because he is temperamentally incapable of discretion. The greatest sin is to get caught, because that would force the authorities to take action they would prefer to avoid.\n\nIf scandal does leak out, the authorities prefer to insist that the boys were merely experimenting or going through a youthful phase. Even the otherwise nonconformist Judd takes this line. (Unlike some of his colleagues, he is firmly heterosexual and regards homosexuality with bemused incomprehension). Bennett, however, realises that being gay is an inescapable part of who he is, not a mere passing fad, and that he will never love women. The film&apos;s implication, in fact, is that Bennett/Burgess spied for the Russians not because he was a convinced Communist but as an act of revenge against the British Establishment for rejecting him on account of his sexual orientation. He never asked himself whether his sexuality would be any more acceptable to the Soviet Establishment than it was to the British one. (By the time the film was made in 1984, homosexuality had been legalised in Britain but remained strictly banned in Russia).\n\nOn one level the title &quot;Another Country&quot; is derived from a line in the hymn &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot;, which we hear being sung, although on another it refers to the Soviet Union, the state to which Judd and ultimately Bennett give their loyalty, with perhaps a hidden reference to Orwell&apos;s theory of &quot;transferred nationalism&quot;- the idea that supporters of Stalin and Soviet Russia were motivated by the same type of uncritical, unthinking nationalism as flag-waving British jingoists, with the difference that their loyalty was transferred from their own country to a foreign one.\n\n&quot;Another Country&quot; was made by Goldcrest, the company which has become most closely associated with the great British cinematic revival of the eighties, but unlike some of their other productions it has largely disappeared from view over the last thirty years. In 1984, controversy over the spy ring was still raging. Leftists, who might under other circumstances have been sympathetic to Communism, savagely attacked the spies as prize examples of upper-class treachery and corruption, whereas some rightists, most notoriously Peregrine Worsthorne, attempted to defend them on the grounds that loyalty to one&apos;s beliefs could be more important than loyalty to one&apos;s country.\n\nSince the end of the Cold Way we no longer care as much about the Cambridge Spies as we once did, which may explain why &quot;Another Country&quot; can seem unfashionable these days. It is, however, a very good film, distinguished by an excellent performance from a young Colin Firth as Judd, surprisingly likable despite his extremist views, and an even better one from Rupert Everett as the floppy-haired, nonchalantly rebellious yet secretly vulnerable Bennett. It also has a lot to say about matters of perennial importance- loyalty to country, loyalty to friends, political idealism and the rights of sexual minorities. An intriguing and thought-provoking film. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Memorable BBC &quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary which first appeared on TV in early 1975, documenting Bowie&apos;s 1974 U.S. &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; tour which morphed into something very different as he reacted to the soul music he listened to out there, which of course took him very soon to the &quot;Young Americans&quot; album, the album that really broke him in the States, including as it did his no. 1 hit &quot;Fame&quot;.\n\nBowie himself has looked back scathingly at his personal behaviour around this time, with a growing cocaine addiction feeding his success and with it his audience&apos;s expectations and his own insecurities. Indeed it was while watching this that director Nicolas Roeg decided to cast the singer in his upcoming movie &quot;The Man Who Fell To Earth&quot;, completely buying into the other-worldly mystery Bowie projects here.\n\nI don&apos;t know, but watching it then, as now, I personally still think he looks Uber-cool no matter how strung-out he might have actually been. The live clips are terrific and it&apos;s clear that nobody else was doing the ambitious things on stage with mime, sets and props that he was. He looks great, if gaunt, in his new-look classic tailored-suits, in so doing, staying ahead of his audience, some of whom are still caught up in the Ziggy look its creator gave up the year before. The music&apos;s great too, if sometimes irritatingly truncated and I personally couldn&apos;t understand the editorial decision to overdub his live performance of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; in his floating cockpit with the already well-known studio version.\n\nFor the interview inserts, Bowie occasionally gets above himself but is often just as quick to catch himself doing so and then puncturing the effect with humour.\n\nBowie was travelling at the speed of light at this period, my favourite spell of his long and often brilliant career and this 50-odd minute documentary gives the viewer at least a glimpse into his vivid existence. Really, the programme could have been twice as long but that&apos;s not to gainsay its value as a behind-the-scenes document of Bowie at his best.",

A really good film that tries to deal with the idea of a dehumanized black economy working for an ever increasingly fascistic USA. Some interesting idea&apos;s, some not so interesting. It definitely has a cyberpunk feel but being from Mexico it was always going to be different.\n\nI am unsure of the budget but the film holds it&apos;s own and the sfx budget seems to have been spent wisely. The acting was good with the lead and support actors being enjoyable enough to watch. I also liked the score which was essentially Latin pop/dance.\n\nThe ending is a little unrealistic given the portrayed future realism of the rest of the film. A good film that is not the greatest sci-fi ever but deserves higher marks considering the obstacles the production team faced. A low budget, sci-fi drama from Mexico is not something you see everyday so it should be applauded.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps more than most films, you&apos;ll either get this or you won&apos;t. Ang Lee seems to have conjured up the past with an accuracy that most filmmakers would spoil with reverence. Through a series of vignettes and very small references to Wadleigh&apos;s 1970 documentary, &quot;Woodstock,&quot; a legendary moment in culture gets celebrated with a sweetness that was part of the era that quickly evaporated.\n\nI was reminded of the film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; not just in the setting but in the tone. Ang Lee keeps the humor from becoming too broad in depiction of the locals whose lives were about to up-ended in a way that no one anticipated but few would not welcome. The actors in particular find a common level to play with that draws the audience into the excitement. We know what will happen, but as the momentum builds to the actual event the audience is swept away just as the characters in the film are.\n\nThe key character, a very unimposing Demetri Martin, never falters in this coming-of-age story that mirrors the culture changes swirling around him. He gives a very strong performance and is virtually never off the screen.\n\nI had read that the &quot;main event&quot; isn&apos;t recreated, and that&apos;s partially true. However, we &quot;see&quot; what most of the actual participants of the event saw of the performances on a stage set up in a cow field. It&apos;s a stunning moment in the film and as magical as the experience must have been. I was roughly the same age as the character, struggling with the changes of adolescence at a moment in time when there really weren&apos;t road-maps for the future. While I was far away from the East Coast, this event reached me in many of the same ways as the characters in the film. I suppose for most people my age that was also true.\n\nWhile I flinched a few times when a &quot;plot&quot; would intrude into this whole dazzling work, it served the purpose for the power and point of the final moments: Standing in the muddy aftermath the hope of what was going to happen next was palpable for a whole generation, but the next event, Altamont with the Rolling Stones, ended it all with crushing horror. Yet, the optimism is still alive, I think. Equality for many racial and sexual minorities were fulfilledor are being so fulfilled at this timeand one of the more ironic points of the film was actually scored during the trailers that preceded the feature: the previews for Michael Moore&apos;s &quot;Capitalism&quot; and that subject is what really ended the counterculture.\n\nBut for Ang Lee he gives the 40th Anniversary of the Woodstock festival an original and unsentimental celebration. (And if hippies annoy you, this isn&apos;t the film you need to see.)",

      "reviewBody": "In 1980&apos;s Chicago two attractive young people develop a very 1980&apos;s relationship. After falling into bed together on their first meeting they progress through a tentative relationship to moving in together, moving out again, and then possibly to some sort of reconciliation.\n\nThe film was made contemporaneously with the period it is set in and is one of those films that evoke their particular time with well-observed accuracy. Demi Moore and Rob Lowe deliver strong performances as the articulate, successful  and confused - central characters, with Moore in particular able to reflect on the developing crises with astute asides.\n\nThe film possibly has two structural problems. First, it is too long. Boy endlessly prostrating himself in front of Girl he has sent packing gets tedious, and the tension regarding what may happen starts to dissipate.\n\nSecondly, the more-or-less mandatory Best Friend characters are almost too strong. Lowe&apos;s buddy James Belushi is a chauvinist slob, but also a bit of a charmer - and with some of the best lines. Moore&apos;s confidante Elizabeth Perkins may be something of a shrew, but a damned attractive one. These two take an intense dislike to each other from the start, and as the main romance stalls their relationship becomes by far the more interesting one with its vague possibility that such a sparky loathing just might lead to something more positive - if pretty combustible!"

For those who don&apos;t know, this WAS a silent movie, and Hughes took so long trying to perfect the aerial sequences that sound came along, so then he had to try to rework everything else into sound, delaying things even further. Hughes was a &quot;bit&quot; of a perfectionist, ala Chaplin with &quot;City Lights&quot; and for every wonderful thing that does, it creates dozens of others you have to deal with as well... My favorite story of the making of this movie (recalling across 30 years from a book by Donald Dwiggins called &quot;The Stunt Pilots&quot; involved Paul Mantz (one of the lead pilots, later to die making &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; after being the king of the Hollywood pilots for over 30 years) and Jean Harlow waiting in an airport restaurant for Hughes to fly in from somewhere and Mantz placing a nickel Coca-Cola bottle under a table leg before Hughes arrived and telling Harlow to &quot;watch this&quot;. Hughes arrives for the meeting and being the perfectionist but also a bit ?, he never says anything about the table, never looks under it, but spends the whole lunch trying to eat with one hand and hold the table level with the other...."

In this sense it is somewhat of a more timeless tale of the greed and corruption of man. Through a well written script and a superb performance by Alfredo del Diestro El Prisionero 13 is a captivating film which encapsulates the sense of chaos prevalent within Mexican Society at the time of the Revolution through the means of a rather simple and small parable.",

      "name": "Survival for women in wartime at a terrible price",
      "reviewBody": "To begin with the end note: When the anonymous memoir adapted here (&apos;Anonyma - Eine Frau in Berlin&apos;) was published in Switzerland in 1959, it was greeted with such outrage among Germans the author allowed no further editions; she of course never revealed her name. Here we are, fifty years later, and the material is still incendiary and hard to get your head around. It concerns events that are unspeakable and incomprehensible.\n\nAs played by the strikingly handsome, elegant Nina Hoss, &quot;Anonyma&quot; is an ash blond who can wear odds and ends as if they were couturier fashions, a journalist fluent in French and Russian, at home in Paris and London, who comes back from assignment to be in the Führer&apos;s capital for the final victory she still believes in. The Third Reich for her and her pals seems a time of freshness and energy for Germany. The war is just a blip on the horizon soon to be done with. She parties with fellow supporters of the Fatherland&apos;s great endeavor who toast the troops and boast that the buffoonish Russians will fall by the wayside. They don&apos;t, and when they invade Berlin and begin the wholesale raping of the German women, she chooses to mete out her favors selectively for her own protection and that of her neighbors in the apartment building. This is the story of how that happens.\n\nWhen Berlin crumbles apartment dwellers are hiding in the basement, like ghosts; then, like condemned men and women given an uneasy reprieve, they return to living in the remnants of apartments. &quot;Anonyma&quot; moves in with a group of others in a large flat and turns over the studio she occupied with her absent soldier boyfriend Gerd (August Diehl), for whom she keeps a diary of what happens, to an unrepentantly Nazi young woman and the adolescent German soldier boyfriend she hides (Sebastian Urzendowsky), who is armed. This unwise gesture is the pistol we know will go off eventually, endangering everybody.\n\nThe film shows only two public events: the invasion, and the official German declaration that the Germans have surrendered Berlin. The period in between is the main focus of the diary and the film. It&apos;s not specified but it was about three months.\n\nThe film focuses on a handful of neighbors, who include ; two lively sisters (Joerdis Triebel, Rosalie Thomass), a strong-willed widow (Irm Hermann); an elderly bookseller (Katharina Blaschke); a liquor dealer (Maria Hartmann); a pair of lesbian lovers (Sandra Hueller, Isabell Gerschke); a refugee girl in hiding (Anne Kanis) and a stolid octogenarian (Erni Mangold). And there are more, not to mention a half dozen clearly defined Russians, including the high ranking officer&apos;s Mongolian guard.\n\nIt&apos;s a bit difficult to keep track of all these, and Woman in Berlin is best at making us feel close to the narrator and conveying a sense of the chaos and uncertainty when the invasion and the raping begin. There seems to be no control. It&apos;s hard to see that anything is going on. The Russians are just there, wandering free, and brutalizing the German women. When these women meet the question they ask each other is not whether but &quot;How often?&quot; Anonyma sleeps with various Russians, willingly and not. Protesting the violations and seeking a protective officer she first becomes involved with Anatol (Roman Gribkov), a pretty, frivolous man who turns out to be not a career soldier but a dairyman. He comes and goes and is no real help. She calls him &quot;a gypsy.&quot; Then she finds a battalion commander, Major Rybkin (the excellent, charismatic Yevgeni Sidikhin), who is unresponsive when she confronts him boldly in front of a lot of Russian soldiers, and then comes around to find her. Unlike the Germans, she says later in her diary (which we see her constantly scribbling in pencil), the Russians appreciate an educated woman.\n\nA strength of the film is that it alternates naturally between noise and violence, drunken celebration when Russians and Germans fraternize in the big apartment, and &quot;love,&quot; which has lost its usual meaning, but lingers on. These extremes never seem overwrought or manipulative. Here&apos;s a time when in a film the fact that nothing makes sense, makes sense. The protagonist recognizes that in the eyes of many she is now a whore, but she questions what a whore is. \n\nMarguerite Duras&apos; screenplay for &apos;Hiroshima Mon Amour&apos; is poetic and overwrought, ut in its rhythmic repetitions it strongly conveys a sense of the aftermath of trauma isn&apos;t found in the somewhat overlong &apos;Woman in Berlin,&apos; which is simply about the confusion of day-to-survival in a world where morality is turned on its head. As Anonyma knew however and as we see in the film, the defeated must capitulate or die, and the invaders have suffered horribly too. One young soldier reconts in Russian, demanding that she translate to all present, how invading Germans brutally slaughtered all the children in his village while he watched. Even Andreij&apos;s wife has been killed by the Germans. And the film shows the range of the then Russian people, the Ukrainians, Caucasians, Mongols, who are to be the Soviet Union.\n\nThough reviewers and commentators seem to think they know what all this material means and proclaim judgments if not on the protagonist, on the filmmaker, this is primarily an example of Germans taking hard looks at repressed material that formerly was too ugly to examine. This isn&apos;t an impassioned indictment or defense, but a movie that uses an extraordinary diary (only published in Germany in 2003) to present an admirably complex picture of a crazy time. If it is both remarkable in its focus and at times quite old fashioned in its methods, that&apos;s as good a way as any to get things across. The result is both specific and wide-reaching, because there&apos;s ample time to ponder a basic issue for civilians in wartime: what does it cost you to survive?",

      "reviewBody": "I remember many years ago on WUTV, originating from Buffalo, New York, a bunch of us would watch the Saturday afternoon &quot;Creature Feature&quot; and &quot;Monster Movies&quot; and laugh our heads off. How ludicrous they were.\n\nNow this was back in the late 70&apos;s, early 80&apos;s when we were &quot;grown up&quot;, so to speak. If we had see these movies when they came out originally in the theaters or drive ins, we probably would have been scared out of our wits.\n\nNow this movie, Earth vs the Spider, a true creature feature, stuck in my mind over many of the other ones. The scene that I remembered for years afterwards and hoped like crazy that they would show the movie again, was the scene when the band starts playing that real hot music in the gym with the spider listening in. I just couldn&apos;t believe how anyone would want to be in the same room as the spider.\n\nI was so happy when they showed the movie, I guess, maybe a half a year later. I was ready. I set up my tape recorder and waited patiently for that particular scene and when I got that music on tape, I got REALLY excited!!!!!!\n\nThat was the only thing that I had from that movie until about 3 months ago. I found a video store that had the movie!!!!! I couldn&apos;t wait to bring it home and play it in order to find out what was the rest of the movie all about.\n\nYes I did remember all about the spider itself and how it reeked havoc in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I remembered about the useless sheriff, Gene Roth, and his attitude towards the townsfolk and the kids (funny he plays a lot of those kind of parts). Plus I remembered the fellow who played Mr. Kingman, the &quot;hero&quot;. He used to play Commander Corry in Space Patrol which was on television in the very early 50s.\n\nThe scene with the band in the gym with the spider and the drama class still was very powerful. I just couldn&apos;t get over how funny it was.\n\nTo me, that made the whole movie a joy to watch!!!!\n\nFor Saturday afternoon fun, where you don&apos;t have to think, rent this one!!! You won&apos;t be disappointed!!!!"

This  picture called for downplayed artistry...and that&apos;s exactly what Jonas  Pate delivered. He knew well enough to keep this film grounded and let  the characters breathe.  And speaking of the characters; they were all beautifully written and  performed. I really wasn&apos;t familiar with most of the cast...but I felt  they all did their character&apos;s justice. Spacey wasn&apos;t the only one that  brought his A-game to the set.  Shrink is not a bundle of excitement. It&apos;s a beautiful, touching movie  that will be enjoyed by any adult with a taste for quality drama.",

      "reviewBody": "Czech director Juraj Herz is best known for his films The Cremator and Ferat Vampire...leaving this little gem to go relatively unnoticed (likely because it&apos;s hard to find with english subtitles).\n\nIt&apos;s a magical tale about a poor student, named Martin, who befriends a group of wandering comedians and puppeteers, after becoming infatuated with the head of the family&apos;s daughter, Toncka.\n\nAfter conning a cruel innkeeper into feeding them a feast, he becomes the target of authorities, who represent the local baron, in his attempt to find a suitor for his daughter- Princess Beatrix- who has been stricken by a sort of love curse.\n\nOriginally, he is arrested, and held in a cell...but uses a magic cloak, which endows him with invisibility to escape.\n\nWhich just seems like an excuse to employ some really great special effects...including some stop motion provided by the legendary Jan and Eva Svankmajer(ova)!!!\n\nEither way, the authorities return for him...but are unable to catch him because he is protected by an amulet, given to him by Toncka...resulting in a sort of slapstick chase scene.\n\nEventually, he gives himself up as a suitor for the princess, when the authorities threaten to imprison his friends.\n\nEight young men had heeded the call before him...and none of them were ever seen or heard from again...but he believes that, being the ninth, he has a good chance.\n\nWhat ensues is really quite weird.\n\nIt turns out that the princess has been mesmerized by the court astrologer, who exploits her lovelessness, to harvest the hearts of young men, which he requires in order to brew an elixir that will endow him with eternal youth and everlasting immortality.\n\nWhich clearly works for him, as he is over 300 years old at this point.\n\nWith the court jester helping him out, Martin seeks to free her from the confines of this torment...even though it involves entering a realm in which time is skewed...with six minutes, in the realm, equaling a year in the outside world.\n\nIf he is successful, he will win himself the hand of the princess in marriage.\n\nAnd, not only does he succeed in this feat, he also manages to save the other eight men, by stealing, and using, the astrologer&apos;s secret elixir to restore them back to life.\n\nHowever, upon their escape...the princess ends up falling in love with the new court astrologer.\n\nSo Martin returns to the countryside in search of Toncka, hoping that it hasn&apos;t been too long...and it&apos;s not too late...for them to fall in love.\n\nThe whole thing has a very magical fantasy vibe to it.\n\nWith some really awesome set designs, great costumes, wonderful special effects, and an expert use of that MGM glow.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely much more heavy on the fantasy, than it is on the horror, but it quite clearly plays off the whole Student Of Prague scenario- less the doppelganger bit- with a bit of Dorian Gray spun in.\n\nAnd it really is a rather fun and enjoyable family-type film, that is saturated with magic, and a load of alluring scenery.\n\nDefinitely check it out, if you get the chance.\n\nEspecially if you are Svankmajer/Svankmajerova fans...as they not only provide the stop motion effects for the film, but also a wonderfully animated intro, and the poster for the film.\n\n6 out of 10.",

And Dell&apos;s character is so loud, obnoxious, and unfunny, that the single best line in the film, and perhaps it&apos;s most dramatic moment, occurs when Greunier tries to get him to shut up.\n\nShari Belafonte is beautiful and Olivier Greunier looks good too, but good looks don&apos;t help a bad script. Some of the acting is poor, but mostly its the absurd script that makes good acting almost inconceivable. Belafonte carries her lines better than the rest of the cast. Greunier is pretty good at looking apathetic, angry and detached, but I have to say that the whole casting non-actors as silent unemotional heroes thing is really wearing thin.\n\nKnowing how low budget this film was, and knowing a little about how it was made, I have to say that the production values are really not that bad, and the directing is actually pretty good. The director, a tenth degree black-bekt and Undefeated Florida Full-Contact Heavyweight Karate Champion, has made some absolutely hideous films (The Watchers http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096425/ being the worst example), but Mars is a big improvement over his earlier works. The film keeps a reasonable pace and doesn&apos;t try to do very much with what it doesn&apos;t have (i.e. a useful script).\n\nThough I just finished watching this last night, I am struggling to remember the plot. Greunier is Caution Templer - a &quot;Keeper&quot; - a kind of corporate intelligence officer. His brother, also a keeper, has been murdered on Mars, where the company has a mining interest. Almost as soon as he gets to Mars to investigate, he connects with Belafonte, who has just made a startling and troublesome discovery, and people start trying to kill them both. There really isn&apos;t much more too it.\n\nI recommend this film for kick-boxing fans, and would give it a very mild recommendation of low budget sci fi fans.",

He is arrested but he does not denounce his friends. He goes to jail alone for a three years sentence and the team disassembles. One year later, they reunify and become aware that Gary was a volunteer of an experiment to reduce his period in prison. Later, they received an encoded message from Gary asking for help. The place where he is lodged is an abandoned laboratory and they decide to rescue him. Once in the location, weird events happen with each member of the group. This movie has a good premise, but something does not work well. For example, why the guys decide to smoke grass during their assignment? How and why exist live animals in a desert place? This forgettable film can be recommended for killing time only. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `A Ameaça&apos;  (`The Menace&apos;)",

      "reviewBody": "If The Beatles are the most inventive band of all time, then Queen must come a close second.  For thirty years now their music has entertained millions in every corner of the globe, with sell-out tours of the UK, Europe, America, Australasia and South America - even Africa was bitten by the Queen bug.  Their performance at Live Aid is widely regarded as the finest that day - and if they&apos;d given the world nothing more than &apos;Bohemian Rhapsody&apos; it would have cemented their names into the history books for all time.\n\nBut there is much more to them that the Rhap... and this dvd is a suggestion of some of that.  Twenty-two performances of some of their most famous (and not so famous) hits from the first eight years of their chart career, from early classics &apos;Keep Yourself Alive&apos; and &apos;Liar&apos; to the camp curiosity that is &apos;Flash&apos; (the signature theme for the 1980 cult hit &apos;Flash Gordon&apos;) - it&apos;s all there.\n\nEarly attempts at promotional footage give way to the land-mark &apos;Bohemian Rhapsody&apos; video, and then a dozen or so further promos along with tv footage and live performances.  Musically, this is some of the best of Queen - visually, they peaked much later on.  Most of these videos are simple lip-synch-to-the-camera routines, as opposed to actually playing with the medium (as they did in the 1980s and beyond), but while they might be a little bit too much for one sitting they make perfect viewing you can just dip into once in a while.\n\nOn a more technical front, the dvd could be much better.  The sound is impressive on the first disc - as sixteen tracks have been remastered into DTS 5.1 sound, and the backup PCM stereo track is adequate for the vast majority who don&apos;t have DTS (why there&apos;s is no Dolby Digital is beyond me). The audio commentary is just about worth hearing, but is really a one-listen affair.  The documentary &apos;Inside The Rhapsody&apos;, on the other hand is an interesting (if badly designed and split into segments) look into the creation of the legendary &apos;Bo Rhap&apos;, in which Brian May plays back different sections of what remains of the original master tapes.\n\nPicture wise, however - this dvd is a mess.  Whilst you can&apos;t improve some of the images that much (due to the videos being worn out and low budget), butchering 4:3 images into 16:9 by simply cropping the top and bottom has left several of these videos looking odd - especially on a standard television set.  The &apos;Bo Rhap&apos; promo in particular, with its kalidoscope imagery is ruined by the process - and it&apos;s not even consistent either, as of the six videos on disc two, four have not been converted and one has been altered to widescreen only to be mastered as a fullscreen image, stretched onto your tv set as a result!\n\nOn the whole then, this dvd is a great disappointment. For a band known to be perfectionists, this is sloppy.  However, the chance to own these videos on a digital medium may win many people over, and if it doesn&apos;t, the alternate takes of &apos;We Will Rock You&apos; and &apos;Bicycle Race&apos; (now with uncensored fat bottomed, naked girls racing on bicycles) will grab many a Queen fan.",

The story has a simple premise: what if, one day, for unknown reasons humans are unable to survive out in the open? &quot;Los Ultimos Dias&quot; tackles this premise head on and cleverly plays out the consequences of how humanity would deal with this problem, how would it move about, how would it find food, etc. The acting is solid throughout, as is the cinematography and the special effects, which were never unconvincing or distracting. The story itself is very well told, nicely paced, and never stretches believability. I&apos;d also like to mention the wonderful musical score that beautifully complemented the visuals. This was an engaging, intelligent, and beautiful film that I can&apos;t wait to watch again.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently picked up a full, subtitled copy of &apos;Miracles&apos;, and I must say that the original is better than the dubbed version I had previously seen, and that version was also around half an hour shorter than the original version. The dubbed version cut out some not-so-important scenes, but things still got confusing at times, and some very funny scenes which did not make into the dubbed version, and at least one of the fight scenes was significantly edited in the dubbed version.\n\n&apos;Miracles&apos; a very different movie to most of Jackie&apos;s work. There is the trademark Jackie Chan action and slapstick, but fights and action sequences are not as frequent as they are in his other movies, as &apos;Miracles&apos; is more about Jackie proving to critics that he can make a movie with extravagant sets and costumes, and complicated camera shots (Who can blame him? James Cameron did the same thing, but &apos;Miracles&apos; is a both an enjoyable and a good movie, while &apos;Titanic&apos; is neither).\n\nThe movie is funny, and the action (what action there is) is excellent, and even the acting is great.\n\n9/10 A great movie. Check it out if you&apos;re a Jackie Chan fan, but make sure you get the full, subtitled movie (should be about two-hours).",

      "reviewBody": "I happened to chance upon the trailer and I thought that the premise of this story was a very fresh and interesting idea and the film seemed pretty interesting, that prompted me to catch this film without reading any prior reviews about it. It was only after watching the film and having a good impression of it that I read some pretty bad reviews about this film.\n\nThe premise of the film is very interesting, incorporating the supernatural and medical research to create a very real feel to the film. And there&apos;s a strong plot which sadly quite a number of horror films lack. The acting and emotions of the lead actors and actresses were very well executed, and their love for their child and the extent they went to protect their child was very touching. The supporting cast was very likable, which made the twists of the film very sudden and very shocking. The background music aided in the suspense of the film and provided an eerie enough atmosphere.\n\nOne thing different about this horror film that I liked is the tone down on the use of &apos;ghosts&apos;, in place was just the effects of the supernatural forces. I also like the use of in-your-face graphic images which was also something scary, and horror-filled on its part. The style of the film reminds me quite like The Eye.\n\nIn all, I feel that this is still a good film to recommend and a fresh change of the usual horror films palette offered.",

Just as bathtub gin was created during prohibition, crystal meth and newer drugs have been developed in this country in response to the decreased drugs coming from Mexico.\n\nThose opposed to decriminalization of drugs would do well to realize that 700,000 people die every year from alcohol (not counting traffic deaths), tobacco, and legal pharmaceuticals, while only 10,000 die from drug use, and no death has every been reported from marijuana.\n\nDo you know where 85% of the heroin distributed throughout the world comes from. The answer may surprise you, but not shock you after seeing this film.",

      "reviewBody": "I took my family to watch this movie, and really enjoyed it! My three year old was captivated throughout the movie as was my 10 year old daughter. I thought Justin Bateman did a great job with his character and the Special effects were top notch. Of course the story was fantastical, but I go to see these movies to escape reality for awhile, and this is a great one to share with the family. I had read some negative reviews prior to seeing the movie, but I decided to see it for myself. After seeing the movie, I feel that some of the previous reviews I read were unfair and in some cases a little mean spirited and thus not really helpful. Lastly, while watching the movie, I noted that many people were laughing and making joyful comments at some of the details they were noticing, and, the audience applauded at the end.",

      "reviewBody": "Quite a few adults will remember the exciting Japanese Cartoon, Gigantor. This black and white show with simplistic animation and wacky voice acting was one of the first of the now popular Japanese Anime shows to be produced and also one of the first to make it to the United States.\n\nAlthough dead here, Gigantor lives on in Japan as a cultural icon similar to how we view classic heroes like Superman, though across the Pacific Gigantor is known as Tetsujin 28 (Iron Man 28).\n\nIf you have any fond memories of Gigantor, this film will really bring them out. The characters and robots are designed specifically to look like their cartoon counterparts and though the tone is a little more serious than the cartoon had ever gotten the movie will still have you recalling the old show with the silly looking robots punching each other back and forth and chucking one another into buildings. \n\nThe story is slow at parts and the robot fighting becomes less exciting as the movie wears on once the initial shock has worn off. That&apos;s not to say it isn&apos;t&apos; impressive. The evil robot &quot;Black Ox&quot; will definitely have you drooling during his first attack on Tokyo.\n\nAlthough the robot computer generated graphics is odd at first, the sense of scale is incredible and far superior than most live action Japanese movies of this type (Name just about any Japanese giant monster movie). The acting is dry occasionally, and at times there is a lot of over-acting but keep in mind that this is a kids movie.\n\nEven so, if you&apos;re a fan of Gigantor you owe it to yourself to import a copy of this movie since it&apos;s doubtful we&apos;ll see it in the States. If you don&apos;t have many fond memories for the flying-metal-Homer-Simpson of a robot then you might want to stay away from this one.",

I wonder if they tried to cash in on the popularity of the more well-known Kickboxer franchise. With totally unknown actors who are certainly not among the best, fight scenes which was nothing special and nothing especially interesting in any way, you just don&apos;t get there. I guess the total result is OK and acceptable, but when there are so many other movies just like this it&apos;s really no reason to watch this at all. Try Kickboxer with van Damme, and even the sequel Kickboxer 2 before even thinking about this one.",

All in all this film is very similar to Stephan Kings &quot;The Stand&quot; although with more action, and it even has the strong religously orientated end as well which for me being a non-believer ruined the film just a little,i think this is deserving of 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Violet is a gangster&apos;s moll, living with Caesar, who launders money for the mob.  Corky is a ex-con who has been hired to decorate the flat next door to Caesar&apos;s flat.  When the two meet they slowly begin a love affair behind Caesar&apos;s back.  After a while Violet comes up with a plan to steal mob money and frame Caesar for it while she and Corky make off with the cash. However, there is no such thing as a simple plan.\n\nI saw this when it was released in the cinema where the overall view seemed to be of an enjoyable noir thriller with a lesbian twist.  A few years later, the Matrix has made the Wachowski brothers hotter than hot and everyone is clambering all over Bound and building up it&apos;s status and pointing to it as a hint of greatness.  Now, after two poor Matrix sequels, many will come back to this film as a sign of their ability before the dollars became more important.  That&apos;s the impression I get anyway, from the message boards, reviews and comments from proper critics.  However, I rewatched this and tried to meet it on it&apos;s own terms rather than be coloured.\n\nOf itself, it does the business quite effectively as a noir crime thriller. The plot is tough and, although not all that twisty, does easily engage and keep the audience pretty gripped.  The lesbian stuff is done a little cynically I think - where do you draw the line between stuff that is required for us to know that the two are lovers, and the stuff that is titillation? I don&apos;t know, the film does it all very tastefully and it is not the film&apos;s fault that some sections of the audience will come to this film because it has a lesbian love scene in it.  I acknowledge that it was done quite sexily and was part of the film, but the crime is the focus.\n\nThe brothers direct with great style - set mainly in a couple of flats, the film moves slickly around the place.  Some shoot outs do reveal a style that was later used in the Matrix films (albeit on a sci-fi level).  The slow-mo stuff is pretty good here and not overly used - little tricks like the shooting over the white paint added to the style of the film no end. Despite being bogged down in a story I believe they took too seriously, I don&apos;t think they need to prove themselves as directors - their films speak for themselves in that regard, and I do hope they get back in the saddle.\n\nThe cast is deep in talent but mostly they play it in the stereotypical characters of the genre.  Tilly is a great moll, at first she appears to be the delicate flower of the film, but she is as much a femme fatale as Corky. Gershon is very sexy, despite being very glamorous for a supposedly butch ex-con; she plays her role well although I would have liked to see her become more of a fall guy towards the end, in true noir fashion - fooled by love!  Pantoliano is enjoyable; his character may not have a lot of meat on it but Joe does very well with a powerful performance.  Support from Meloni and Ryan is good even if they all fit the gangster clichés required by the script.\n\nOverall this is an enjoyable genre film - no more and no less.  The lesbian stuff is a nice twist on the usual formula but it isn&apos;t pushed enough to be classed as exploitative (although there&apos;s no doubt that the film gained audience as a result of the love scenes).  The cast are good and the direction is stylish, making for a slickly enjoyable noir."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cadillac Records&quot; is a fun, fast, flashy introduction to the world of Chess Records. In the 1950s, Leonard Chess, a Polish-born Jew in Chicago, along with his brother Phil (not seen in this film) produced &quot;race&quot; records by African American blues and rock and roll legends like Muddy Waters, Howlin&apos; Wolf, Chuck Berry and Etta James.\n\nThese artists&apos; work had huge impact on popular music; the Rolling Stones are shown on a pilgrimage to Chess Studio. Their music is great and is played all but non-stop on the soundtrack, which is a very good thing. Flashy glimpses into the glamorous styles of the 1950s and 60s include loving looks at the many Cadillacs Chess gives as gifts to his star performers.\n\nJeffrey Wright is quietly compelling as Muddy Waters. Mos Def is a charming Chuck Berry; he really communicates the charisma that Berry exuded to his adoring female fans. Eamonn Walker is terrific, and appropriately intimidating, as Howlin&apos; Wolf. Walker electrifies the screen with his every morsel of screen time; I wish that after they&apos;d finished &quot;Cadillac Records,&quot; they had just kept the sets up and kept the cameras running and began a biography of Howlin&apos; Wolf with Walker in the lead. Beyonce Knowles is very beautiful and pays worthy tribute to Etta James, the singer she plays.\n\n&quot;Cadillac Records&quot; feels a bit rushed, and not as deep and probing as it could have been. Perhaps much backstory was cut out? A shame, because Adrien Brody, a brilliant and compelling actor, is not given enough to do.\n\nSo much more could and should have been said about Chess the man and his motivations, and the complex relationship he had with his singers. There is the story that Chess put Muddy Waters to work painting his ceiling. Some accused him of paternalism; curious viewers are advised to pick up Nadine Cohodas&apos; book &quot;Spinning Blues into Gold: The Chess Brothers and the Legendary Chess Records.&quot; Also, &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; can&apos;t avoid the clichés inherent in music biopics: the innocent character is introduced to drugs for the first time, and is ruined by them; the self destructiveness of brilliant people, the exhilarating, brutal, rags-to-riches-to-obscurity trajectory of show biz careers. For all that, &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; is fun and it makes you want to learn more about an important cultural moment in American history.",

      "reviewBody": "What can you say about the film that started it all? Where popular culture as we know it took shape in a &quot;let there be light&quot; Genesis kind of way? Where pop rock became worth listening and not just dancing to? Where John, Paul, George, and Ringo became firmly established as individual personalities as well as the premier entertainment troupe of the 20th century?\n\nOnly this: &quot;A Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; is good, yes, and significant, but it&apos;s fun, too. Still, and above everything else, it&apos;s a lot of fun.\n\n&quot;A Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; is probably more responsible for the Beatles&apos; enduring image in our culture than any single song they made. It came out in 1964, within a few short months of the Fab Four&apos;s sensational appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show that truly launched them globally, though they had been making great pop music for more than a year which was all the rage across Europe. &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; captures the band when they were still relatively provincial and innocent, not yet in the &quot;marijuana for breakfast&quot; phase they were well into the following year when they made the zanier &quot;Help!&quot; LSD, Yoko, and the Maharishi were not even on the radar, nor was the psychedelic era the Beatles would usher in less than three years later. Finally &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; clicked not only with the kids but the adults, who previously viewed the band as a motley band of overplayed haircuts. It gave all the generations of the time something they could agree on. These guys were good.\n\nThe story of &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; is thin by design. We see the Beatles in slightly fictionalized form, with a manager named Norm and a roadie named Shake, traveling by train across England and ducking into a studio to make a TV appearance. Paul has his grandfather along, a codgy old troublemaker who nevertheless is &quot;very clean.&quot; The irony of the movie is that the old guy, played by British TV star Wilfrid Brambell, is the one that continually ruffles the feathers of society while the Boys themselves play things fairly straight and legal.\n\nGrandpa has the best take on the meager storyline: &quot;I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery, and so far I&apos;ve been in a train and a room and car and a room and a room and a room!&quot; Brambell works very well in the film, a needful focal point in a film that requires some bearings in order to work. Of the Beatles themselves, Ringo makes the strongest single impression by showcasing his vulnerable side while John probably has the best moments with his wacky, caustic humor. George shines, too, in a scene with a trend-happy fashion maven, and married one of the girls on the train in real life, so he did pretty well here, too.\n\nIs it the best Beatles film? I think &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is better for what it&apos;s worth, but &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; is the best film actually featuring the Beatles for who they were and what they were about.\n\nGreat music, too. The sequence on the train with &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; still works as a video, with all the baggage-car bric-a-brac thrown in for ambiance. Then there&apos;s &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love,&quot; which shows the Beatles in full-tilt boogie mode after momentarily escaping their studio confines. &quot;And I Love Her&quot; has some of the film&apos;s greatest camera work, very moody and intense in its focus on how well the Beatles worked in a TV studio setting.\n\nAs a film, &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; lacks a bit of heart. Not that it&apos;s cold or cruel, just a trifle too detached to get enveloped by, the way one does with great cinema. I don&apos;t really miss the fact that &quot;Help!&quot; wasn&apos;t a true sequel; &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; works for its 90-plus minutes but doesn&apos;t leave you wanting more. The relationships between the band members, and with Grandpa, Norm, and Shake, are left unexplored, and you don&apos;t really miss that as much as you maybe should.\n\nBut as a collection of small, witty moments interspersed with great music, &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Night&quot; is a pleasure through-and-through. Like the scene where John cuts the tailor&apos;s measure (&quot;I now declare this bridge open&quot;) or has that absurd corridor chat with Anna Quayle (&quot;She looks more like him than I do.&quot;) Or when Ringo tells the crotchety train passenger who complains he &quot;fought the war for your sort&quot; that &quot;I bet you&apos;re sorry you won!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "... with an intern being shot in the face at point blank range outside of the hospital as he takes a smoke break after dealing with an emergency case. The cops investigate but can find nothing amiss and can find no enemies that the victim might have had. So they decide to plant detective Fred Rowan (Richard Conte) undercover as intern Fred GIlbert. Fred had two years of premed and spent three years during WWII as a medic, but he is NOT a doctor! He is given strict instructions by the superintendent of the hospital and by his superiors in the police department to try to fake it as best he can and rely on nurses, but if he is in a pinch to do something he is not qualified to do to a patient that he MUST blow his cover and get an actual doctor. This does cause a couple of close calls that Fred manages to think his way out of.\n\nFred rooms with the victim&apos;s old roommate who is not exactly the welcome wagon. He has invisible lines drawn down the middle of the room like he is WKRP&apos;s Les Nessman, and all he talks about is money - how much he needs it to go into private practice and how much he resents those who have it. Fred is trying to get the guy to open up when he also ends up dead - drowned in the river with a blow to the head. Maybe it was suicide - maybe it wasn&apos;t. So now there are two deaths for Fred to investigate, still no clues.\n\nThis was very cleverly done - a rare hospital noir so there&apos;s a lack of traditional noirish characters but plenty of suspense and a well written and intelligent script.\n\nSince it is obvious this was shot at and around Bellevue hospital, there is a prologue featuring Conte that brags on Bellevue and thanks the hospital for making their facilities available during shooting while explaining that this story could take place anywhere but it did not take place at Bellevue. During the film Bellevue is bragged on some more as the interns are taken on a mini-tour of the facilities. Recommended.",

It was a favorite. If anyone..like the idiot before me, thinks this movie is not suitable for children..and needs an R rating, should not be allowed to write comments on movies. This movie was amazing, and geared specifically for a child viewer. In fact, if memory serves correctly..Isn&apos;t this a Disney produced movie? If Children are allowed to play video games with guns and violence, I don&apos;t think a little National Geographic topless Indian women will be harmful to children. They&apos;ll probably not even notice.",

Surely, it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog&apos;s Heart (Russian film). Really, the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can&apos;t even say that they &quot;play&quot;. No, they LIVE as if it was happening to them. Notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. The hate and love in one piece. And the final scene!\n\nReally, i&apos;m still under impression of that film. It&apos;s very hard, even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson did) the impact would be twice strong.\n\nI compared it with &quot;ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO&apos;S NEST&quot;. I like this film either (and the novel itself is good, too), but after Frederikson&apos;s movie it seems simple. (the same difference I noticed after i watched the film &quot;American history X&quot; and &quot;ROMPER STOMPER&quot; - the latter is deeper). I mean Milos Forman only showed the material point of view of the problem. You watch it, then you say Yes, it&apos;s a good film, i like him, i don&apos;t like her, and that&apos;s it. But &quot;Angels&quot; leave you a wide base to think. There are no bad and good boys in the film. Cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do. Like the girlfriend of one of the patient. Of course she&apos;s young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger (the result is his suicide). Why ask him what have he done? Aren&apos;t you insane yourself to ask? Why do not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it is even funny when those people talk to each other. They say genius things! There are a lot of things I would like to say about this film, but i&apos;m not so good in english. But i&apos;m sure, those of you, who have watched the movie, understand me.\n\nGood luck!",

      "name": "Howard redeems himself with a truly compelling film that leaves its theatrical roots behind",
      "reviewBody": "It is a testament to Peter Morgan&apos;s humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard&apos;s ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling &quot;what will happen&quot; drama (as he did with Apollo 13) that Frost/Nixon succeeds as a film.\n\nThis is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof, Closer, The Producers, have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films, many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn&apos;t had the chance, but they weren&apos;t necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan&apos;s work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious, he has not tried to enforce his already successful stage-play onto a film director  he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference  the pacing is changed, the power achieved in different ways.\n\nFor this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film  one long two-hander scene after another, duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings, but Howard knows when we need quick cuts, when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a post-scene reaction, and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.\n\nFor some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can&apos;t escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the head-to-head scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary, but it sadly means that the supporting players, so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half, fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving &apos;Swifty&apos; Lazar, Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.\n\nFrank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb, as they were on stage, and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn&apos;t watching the real Nixon. It&apos;s not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you&apos;re watching an actor.\n\nPlatt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role  instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure, he has the most to do but he is completely in this role, he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this film.",

The film shows the viewer the whole process from planning, advertising to building a &apos;front&apos;. The only part that hasn&apos;t been done is the making of the actual supermarket. Through this film they show the power of advertisement, which is a multi-billion dollar industry and the influence it has on the common citizen and that corporate companies really know every button to press in order to successfully manipulate consumers.\n\nIn this film, thousands of people excitedly gather together, with family or friends, to &apos;raid&apos; the non-existent supermarket which is to &apos;open&apos; at 10:00. Some have even arrived as early as 7:00 a.m. &apos;Ceský Sen&apos; has sparked a lot of controversy. Many Czech people were infuriated as they felt betrayed and conned and infuriated that the government spent so much money on advertising. Vít Klusák and Filip Remunda have tackled significant issues and pointed out how people have almost become &apos;pawns&apos; to corporate industries.\n\n&apos;Ceský Sen&apos; is also a well made film. Shot in mock documentary style, Klusák and Remunda bring a lot of humour while touching on various issues relevant to today&apos;s economy. Even though they have angered a lot of people, they have awakened many through their poignant film."

Mahanagar is a fascinating dramatic case study of the collision of modernism and traditionalism that produced a sociocultural duality/dichotomy in twentieth-century India&apos;s urban landscapes.\n\nWe see all sorts of manifestations of duality in Mahanagar. The tension-cum-rivalry of Arati and Subrata is, of course, the most obvious manifestation. However, we also have the duality of the new- generation Arati/Subrata and the old-generation Sarojini/Priyogopal (Subrata&apos;s mother and father) and Arati, who wears traditional clothing and speaks Bengali, versus Edith, the English-speaking Anglo-Indian in Western dress. These instances of duality speak directly to the moment in which things began to make a 180-degree shift in India, when women became the breadwinners of the household and traditional gender norms became subsumed by sexual liberation.\n\nWith a leading lady as precise as Mukherjee, Ray was able wrap these complex coterminous processes up in a relatively tidy package. Mahanagar is essential viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "Drop Dead Fred is a difficult film to review. I saw it for the first time when I was 13 years old or something, and I absolutely loved it because I was right in the middle of the age group at which the film is directed. I watched it again recently, and while the film&apos;s slapstick comedy did not hold quite the same massive appeal (although I was still hugely entertained) as it did when I was younger, I regretted to discover that I had grown out of a lot of the goofy antics that went on in the movie.\n\nHowever, I was reading through some of the reviews written on the IMDb by other users, and was amazed at how offended a couple of people were by this film, revealing in their reviews a total detachment from their own inner selves and a complete misunderstanding for the little people that we call kids. No, for example, I would NOT recommend a seven year old girl to psychiatric help for making a mess. This is arguably one of the most ludicrous ideas that I have ever read on the Internet Movie Database in my entire life, and believe me, I have read some jaw-droppingly moronic comments on this beloved site.\n\nIf you read through the user comments for this movie, you can so clearly see the difference in the people who liked it and the ones who hate it that it almost makes you laugh out loud that these people can&apos;t see that they are exactly the kinds of people that the movie rebels against. Drop Dead Fred begs Elizabeth not to let her mother turn her into one of them because he doesn&apos;t want her to turn into the kind of person who is so uptight and frigid and barren that she would be incapable of enjoying exactly the kind of entertainment and fun that Drop Dead Fred is.\n\nThis is a movie that was made for people who are still in touch with their inner child, people who realize that a little girl with a mother who has absolutely no understanding of the mind of a child has every right to escape into the world of an imaginary friend if it will help her escape the grayness and responsibility imposed on her by her mother, who demands absolute perfection and hasn&apos;t the first clue about how to raise a child. Very similar things can be said about various IMDb users, such as ones who refer to Fred as a product of a deranged mind or say anything about psychos or brutality or insanity.\n\nDrop Dead Fred is not a film about an insane little girl. Indeed, I like to think that the world is populated mostly with people who understand that the minds of young children operate slightly differently than their parents&apos;and our own, and that they can be forgiven for getting into a little mischief. I am generally against grouping together people who did not like a certain film, but in this case it seems overly obvious that the people who wrote negative reviews of this fun comedy are simply the people who resent being pointed out as the kinds of people that they are.\n\nDrop Dead Fred is a movie that was made for fun, to be enjoyed, laughed at, and respected for reminding us that we need to lighten up occasionally and, while not necessarily flinging spaghetti in a nice restaurant, act like children every once in a while to prevent ourselves from being driven insane by the fast-paced society that we live in. And if you can&apos;t do that, if you hated Drop Dead Fred because you simply can&apos;t understand that concept, if, indeed, you think that Elizabeth is in dire need of psychiatric care, you may want to step back and look closely at your life and your views.\n\n YOU may be the one in need of therapy.",

It&apos;s somewhat akin to Psychology, where there are several right answers to every question.\n\nWhat was most amazing, however, was the actions of some of these scientists while they were out in the field. Studying a people is one thing, but apparently some are not content to do just that and started making changes in their lives. There were indications of pedophilia and even prostitution was introduced in some villages.\n\nThe value of this film lies not in the anthropological facts, which are quite interesting, but in the discussion of behavior of anthropologists that went clearly over the line.",

      "reviewBody": "Give Vishal Bharadwaj a solid pat on the back, and sit back waiting for his next movie. This man seethes brilliance in his film-making. His dialogues, his script, his music, and his direction - all are top-notch, and as I said, this movie proves that Makdi was no fluke. \n\nThe movie is based on Macbeth; and oh does it stay faithful to the story. For setting, Vishal trades the Lord &amp; Lady for &apos;Bhai&apos; (Gangster) and Mistress in today&apos;s Mumbai underworld complete with corrupt cops, loads of handguns and conniving politicians. \n\nThe story follows Maqbool (Macbeth: Irfan Khan), the right-hand man of Abbaji (King Duncan: Pankaj Kapoor) - the most powerful and influential ganglord in Mumbai. Abbaji&apos;s mistress Nimmi (Lady Macbeth: Tabu) falls in love with Maqbool &amp; inspires him to kill Abbaji and take-over his empire. What they did not expect was the surfacing of guilt, and loyals to Abbaji. \n\nVishal projects the story from inside the crime-family, playing with the loyalties of the viewer. Every character is built deep; you can&apos;t find yourself rooting for or against anyone, so justified is each in his/her actions. Add to that the wonderful dialogues &amp; screenplay hiding a mock to reality, society and movies. Watching this movie alone at home, I applauded on a regular basis - so fulfilling was the experience. \n\nThe best &apos;character translation&apos; of the play for me was morphing the three witches that haunt Macbeth into the two corrupt cops, as played by the brilliant-to-a-fault Naseeruddin Shah &amp; Om Puri. The two actors signed up for the smaller roles just to have a chance to work with each other after a long time, and oh are there sparks on screen. If this was Hollywood, we would see a spin-off on their characters. Most of the hum-our-draped satire comes from these two, and it is the kind of hum-our you shake your head at, not roll laughing at. Although I like Naseer more, Om gets and does the better part here. \n\nIrfan Khan IS the successor of these two actors. He again portrays a character as if he was born to play it. From his matter-of-fact way of delivering lines to the screamingly clear eyes, he is a treat to watch. Tabu plays Lady Macbeth as her usual self. Nothing beyond competent, but nothing below either. \n\nAnd Pankaj Kapoor: He again proves how under-rated he is. From the tormented scientist in Ek Doctor ki Maut to the hilarious possessive father in Chameli ki Shaadi, this guy has done all of the variety and is as good as the best, but never got the recognition that Naseer &amp; Om got. Indeed, Kapoor redefines the Indian gang lord, and surpasses all previous attempts at such a role. His Abbaji is the most captivating character in the movie, yet the most firmly rooted in reality. It defines: If Mumbai has a Godfather, this is he or how he should be. \n\nEach of the actors that have portrayed their respective characters, I can&apos;t think of even one major character being replaced by any other in bollywood. \n\nI rate this film 4.5 of 5 \n\n---- \n\nTrivia: - The first scene of the movie shows a minion with Naseer &amp; Om Puri. This thin faced bald actor is the co-screen-writer Abbas Tyrewala putting in a cameo. - Naseerudding Shah conducted a workshop for all actors in the movie for a few days before start of filming, to get everyone in character and for natural interactions. - Shekhar Kapoor saw this movie at a European (I forget which) Film Festival, and offered Vishal a movie then &amp; there. They discussed plans till dawn. - Macbeth is Vishal&apos;s favourite play. He wanted to make a movie for mature audiences after his debut with the children&apos;s movie Makdee (Shabana Azmi played the witch for free in that one!)",

      "reviewBody": "Rituparno Ghosh&apos;s The Last Lear is an artistic though slightly simplistic work. I did not really like the film being in English but obviously it wouldn&apos;t have been possible in Hindi or Bengali, considering it&apos;s about a Shakespearean actor. The story is interesting, and the idea of taking an old, Shakespearean theatre actor (Bachchan) and casting him in a motion picture is intelligent. Not less impressive is that despite the film being entirely about Bachchan, all the other characters are well-written. Every character is portrayed as a struggling person. In his way to become a film actor, we meet several characters through Bachchan&apos;s Harry: his co-star, Shabnam (Zinta), a model-turned-actress who does not know how to act and what to do with her film career, and who has problems with her jealous husband; Siddharth (Rampal), an arrogant independent filmmaker; Vandana (Shah), Bachchan&apos;s mistress (double-meaning); and his confused nurse, played by Divya Dutta. I think the film was well written, although it does become a bit slow at times. Harry&apos;s character is wonderful - an artist who insists to work on his own artistic terms. I liked Bachchan&apos;s scenes, I liked the scenes of the three women who have a nice evening on the day of the film&apos;s release, I liked the scenes of Bachchan and Zinta together, their conversations about what acting is.\n\nBachchan is extraordinary - one of his finest and most difficult performances ever. He is intense, generous, impulsive, and his English line delivery is spectacular. The film belongs to him completely, although the rest of the cast do a good job. Preity Zinta is extremely vulnerable as Shabnam. She lets go of her bubbly, vivacious image completely, and is portrayed as a very conflicted woman throughout. Although she gives a fine performance, I don&apos;t find it up to the level of her work in her commercial films - I generally prefer her in roles of vibrant and strong women who are full of life. Anyway, I liked the scenes in which she smoke anxiously, I liked the scene in which Bachchan teaches her how to release tensions by screaming, and she breaks down (this scene has appeared several times in different films), and she was particularly impressive in the film&apos;s last scene. Shefali Shah turns in a brilliant, exceptional performance, not that I expected any less from her. Arjun Rampal and Divya Dutta are very good as well. I knew from the very beginning that this film would not work for the wide audience, it&apos;s a film for people who like artistic films and festival stuff. This is not a particularly entertaining film, but I enjoyed it mainly due to Bachchan&apos;s performance.",

      "reviewBody": "From Terrance Zdunich, creator of &quot;Repo: The Genetic Opera&quot;, and Darren Lynn Bousman, director of the film adaptation of &quot;Repo&quot;, as well as &quot;Saw&quot; II-IV comes the short film anthology &quot;The Devil&apos;s Carnival&quot;, an insane, musical horror/comedy centering on three people who have died and ended up in Hell, where the must contend with various obstacles.\n\nThis is an entertaining, yet highly flawed film.\n\nWe follow John (Sean Patrick Flannery), a grieving father who committed suicide, Tamara (Jessica Lowndes) who trusts people too easily and was killed by her boyfriend, and petty thief Ms. Merrywood (Briana Evigan) whom was gunned-down presumably by police. All three awaken near the &quot;Devil&apos;s Carnival&quot;, a twisted sideshow in Hell run by and populated by various demons, harpies and oddball characters, and of course headed by Lucifer himself. (Zdunich)\n\nMeanwhile, Lucifer reads to a young child from Aesope&apos;s Fables, narrating stories that mirror the struggles of the three main characters as they are forced into dark, deadly tests.\n\nThe film is fairly simplistic and has a decent structure, and is populated by a handful of well-done musical numbers. (It is a bit of a Rock Opera, to be honest, similar to Repo) The musical numbers may not be too memorable, but they&apos;re an absolute blast, and are very well- written and performed.\n\nCharacters are developed just enough for it&apos;s short 50-or-so-minute run- time. Although the only character you will really care about is John, as he&apos;s far more sympathetic than Merrywood or Tamara.\n\nThe supporting cast (including Bill Mosely, Alexa Vega, Emilie Autumn and others as the cast members of the Carnival) are a lot of fun, but aren&apos;t really developed.\n\nAnd the camera-work, though decent for a short film, is a bit too chaotic at times. During the titular musical number &quot;The Devil&apos;s Carnival&quot;, the camera seems to randomly glide around rather than follow any sort of direction, which kind of distracted from it.\n\nI also take issue with the pacing of the story. Well it is well- structured, the film bogs itself down too much in the first 10-or-so minutes, making the rest of the film feel needlessly rushed.\n\nBut for what it is, it&apos;s worth seeing. The music is good, the characters are memorable despite uneven development, and it&apos;s a fine little short film.\n\nI give &quot;The Devil&apos;s Carnival&quot; a slightly-above-average 6 out of 10. Fans of Zdunich, Bousman or horror in general should check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "What a pleasant comedy! Here&apos;s a movie that brings back a subject which was specific to the cartoons from the forties and fifties: the game of the cat and the mouse. Here, there&apos;s a real mouse and the cat is epitomized by the Schmuntz brothers who wish to get rid of her in order to sell an old but expensive house. The more the film advances, the more the traps prepared by Lars and Ernie Schmuntz are worked out: it begins with the simple, trivial trap: the mousetrap and it ends with the appearance of the mouse-exterminator ( an unexpected and irresistible Christopher Walken). In short, what it seems to be a child&apos;s play at the beginning of the movie, ends up becoming a merciless fight in which there&apos;ll be no winner, no loser... Gore Verbinski adopted an inventive and clever making and he rightly choose his actors. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans form an ideal duo, not very far from the legendary Laurel and Hardy. They&apos;ve got a different personality but are united to kill this mouse. Moreover, the movie doesn&apos;t only focus on this &quot;mouse hunt&quot; but also on the Schmuntz brothers&apos; efforts to earn money in order to save their father&apos;s string factory ( a world without string is chaos...). Let&apos;s add some hilarious and efficient gags ; the movie pays a tribute to Tex Avery. Dialogs that kick the bull&apos;s eye and some cues are powerful such as: &quot;in this mouse&apos;s mind, you are the intruders&quot; says Walken to the Schmuntz brothers. At last, the real mouse is, of course, a little pest (she&apos;s even compared to Hitler with a tail) but in parallel, Verbinski attempts to make her touching. At the end, a comedy without too many claims but efficient enough to please to a large public.",

Cal suspects that his mother, long believed dead, is the madame of a local brothel, and when this is confirmed, the young man is convinced that he has found the reason why he is bad...\n\nHis awkward, unhelpful attempts to find himself and come to terms with his situation led young audiences to identify with him immediately, an identification that was compounded by his role in &apos;Rebel Without a Cause&apos; where again, only with more violence, he rebelled against his middle class family...\n\nThe impact he had made on the anxious, unhappy youth of that time was confirmed as much by his death as by the style and abandon of his life.. \n\nDean was a youth who rebelled against the riches of the American Dream, though he finally denounced it all in a reckless moment... Dean therefore embodied the confused attitudes of a generation who had never suffered through the Depression and rejected the acquisitive attitudes of their parents, while at the same time they hankered after the American Dream... Dean gave physical form to the perplexing confusion of ideals, that haunted the majority of postwar American youth...",

      "reviewBody": "Germany, 1977. A mature, rich and bored woman called Elisabeth (Elke Aufderheide) is taking a ride with the &quot;Rheingold&quot;, a first-class high-speed train of the seventies along the river Rhine. In the train she is meeting her old school mate and lover who is working as a waiter and falls in love with him again. Her husband, a busy politician, realizes what&apos;s going on and tries to catch the train to face his wife and her lover in a fatal showdown.\n\nThat&apos;s the whole storyline of this well-shot German independent movie, but director Niklaus Schilling (&quot;Nachtschatten&quot;, &quot;Der Westen leuchtet&quot; and &quot;Der Willi-Busch-Report&quot;) uses weird editing techniques and lots of flashbacks and dream-like sequences to explain what going on - and what could have happened. This is sometimes to much for the viewer, and you fastly get lost within the narration and plot, as Schilling becomes to fascinated by the sheer contrast between the fast-running train (perfectly shot in the beautiful Rhine valley landscapes) and the slow and paralyzed acting of the persons involved.\n\nIn the last 30 minutes, Schilling only shows the nameless woman sitting in her cabin, bleeding to death after a knife attack by her husband and staring out of the window while being watched by another well-looking woman and listening to the narration of an older passenger about the Rhinestone tale. This long-lasting sequence is only interrupted by moody flashbacks of her first encounters with her husband and lover and surreal love and sex scenes.\n\nThis extreme movie style is the strength of this movie as well as its weakness at the same time - the thrilling story and the beautiful pictures get lost in the slow pacing and the sometimes too lame direction. In the end you will fall asleep during the film is running, or you will stay awake and be confused and fascinated at the same time. &quot;Rheingold&quot; is not as good as &quot;Nachtschatten&quot;, but still one of Schilling&apos;s better movies. Give it a try.",

People go in with some expectations of a &apos;Yash Chopra&apos; type of romance and are not disappointed at all. It begins with a fearless army officer Samar moving all along Kashmir diffusing bombs without tinge of fear in his mind. The story flies in flashback after the audience is well settled for the movie. Shah Rukh Khan handles the role of a strict army officer and jolly youngster so well that it seems hard to believe that both roles are played by the same man. Anushka sharma is bubbly and &apos; happy-go-lucky girl&apos; who lives life to the fullest breathing every moment of her life happily. Katrina Kaif on other hand is exactly opposite to Anushka. She is a God-lover, believes in goodness,reserved, n filled totally with love. Yashji never lost hold of his directorial touch in the movie. The songs do deserve a thumbs up. Especially the romantic Saans and foot-tapping Ishq shava. Challa makes u groove a bit on your seat. Heer likely to trigger some emotion So for all the romance lovers, JTHJ is a perfect and &apos;go for it&apos; film.",

The film is uncannily realistic for anyone who has done a really long journey by train.  A few scenes were so convincing I found myself having flashbacks.  Funny, unpretentious, and humane - a &quot;romantic comedy&quot; that won&apos;t make you want to hurl.",

Bravestarr the legend is a feature length movie which introduces our sheriff of new texas. The film involves bravestarr coming to terms with his new found powers to fight the evil Spirit Stampede and his &apos;Minions&apos; led by Tex Hex. The show&apos;s animation may appear dated but dont let that fool you. so if you get a chance to see this fine piece of nostalgia do not hesitate\n\n Also i would like to point out that this was only released in cinemas in america to my knowledge the is no DVD or VHS\n\nA VHS was released in the uk so if you live there you&apos;re in luck",

      "reviewBody": "Bad Teacher is funny in ways it shouldn&apos;t be. Cameron Diaz owns the role of Elizabeth as the foul-mouthed, pot smoking, trashy blonde teacher with a twisted outlook on life. Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he&apos;s just awkward....there&apos;s no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake&apos;s characters as Amy Squirrel. Her over-the-top performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he&apos;s in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all, the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways. \n\nThere are some setbacks to Bad Teacher which stop it from being a great comedy. The plot devices used to move the story along are unconvincing and overplayed. Character transformations are equally unconvincing, uninspired, and rushed. Some scenes feel forced for the sake of cheap laughs or shock value. None of it though is shocking enough for this to be an effective method of comedy. Sometimes the characters feel a bit too weird even for the universe of strange the movie sets early on. Jason Segel&apos;s Russell is the most interesting character in the movie and yet for some reason is greatly underused. He pops up in pointless scenes simply to interject a laugh and then disappears for long stretches of time. \n\nBad Teacher is a funny movie. The critics have not been so generous with their reviews, but who listens to them anymore anyways? If you are into dark comedies or a raunchy brand of humor, you will find yourself laughing with this one. While the plot devices are forced and some of the humor could have been better with a more subtle approach, overall this is a decent flick to chill out on the couch and laugh with. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Well well...\n\nmy first &apos;review&apos; on IMDb. Until now I&apos;ve mostly read others opinions and reviews, usually ignoring well-meant and sincere advises to NOT watch certain movies. Let me just say: I hope I can spare some people 90 minutes of utter misery by saying DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! I&apos;m quite a fan of this type of movies, where usually some kind of animal or creature, created by some chemical waste or awakened from a centuries long slumber, is threatening a crew or city and killing/destroying everything in it&apos;s wake. I&apos;m used to such movies not rating too high on IMDb as well. But this one definitely beats everything when it comes to being complete crap.\n\nThe storyline... I&apos;m not really sure there was one. The special effects... imagine a 100foot crocodile making it&apos;s way into the water, without even the slightest ripple in the water surface; amazing? Not as amazing as how it stampedes around noisy like a herd of mammoths in one scene, yet manages to sneak up on our brave heroes without a sound in the next.\n\nOne other annoying thing was the sound; I don&apos;t know if my sound system was mucking up on me, but 3/4 of the dialogs were impossible to hear if you don&apos;t want to actively raise and lower your volume continuously. Especially when a &apos;background&apos; music or tune is playing (which is most of the time), it becomes impossible to hear what is being said. Learn to read lips or make sure you have the subtitles on.\n\nAh to cut it short, this really is a miserable attempt at a movie. Feel absolutely free to watch it, but don&apos;t say you weren&apos;t warned.",

It is such a joy to watch (and I&apos;ve watched it several times) that I can&apos;t help but wonder why others can&apos;t &quot;get it&quot; but must pick at points that are simply irrelevant. Do you question whether Superman can actually fly or where is the exact location of the Shire? Pontiac Moon is a movie for heaven&apos;s sake and it&apos;s hugely enjoyable, moving and entertaining. It encourages you to step out of your box and go out into the world because life is meant to be an adventure of the mind and body. This is not for people who wish to live average and mediocre lives of quiet desperation. I&apos;ll watch it again and again.\n\nThank you, Ted Danson.",

      "reviewBody": "Sleuthing in suburbia--Disney style--after a small town teller is kidnapped by two bank robbers. Not only does this comedy feature the least-objectionable performance by Dean Jones ever, it also has Hayley Mills and Dorothy Provine as a wonderfully kooky pair of sisters and a fantastic feline hero. This Siamese cat is just gorgeous, and it&apos;s a lot of fun watching the bumbling humans trying to tail him down alleys and city streets. The bad guys of the piece (Neville Brand and Frank Gorshin) are also perfect, threatening but not overbearing, with just enough menace to make the kidnapped woman&apos;s predicament a little scary. I also loved the wacky next-door neighbors (Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest), Hayley&apos;s surfer-boyfriend named Canoe (Tom Lowell), and befuddled Ed Wynn as a jewelry salesman. Simply put, a wonderful modern-day caper for parents and kids which puts the remake with Christina Ricci to shame. ***1/2 from ****",

Most car movies out there are entertainment-only movies for the general audience, so they are full of hammy dialog, hammy acting, hammy directing and inaccuracies about cars.\n\nThis is fairly accurate about cars (not perfect, but not outrageous either), has some hammy dialog but the acting and directing are quite competent compared with the Fast and the Furious.\n\nI highly recommend this film for lovers of cars and drag racing in particular. It&apos;s also good to see street racers take it to the track like they should; although there are scenes of irresponsible driving, those scenes don&apos;t go well for the main character and the movie leads the audience morally in the right direction: to the track.",

      "reviewBody": "Mid-sixties Istambul comes across as very European locations and serve as an excellent backdrop for most of the action . The plot was a satisfying mix of set pieces and unexpected plot twists . An agreeable all action sixties Euro-nostalgia trip , being fast paced and rightly developed . The film concerns about an American agent called Dick Malloy (Ken Clark) assigned by CIA Chief Heston (Philippe Hersent) to save an abducted scientific named Kurtz (Ennio Balbo) who has invented a weapon capable of disintegrating solid matter . The scientist is kidnapped by a tyrant criminal band led Goldwyn (Franco Ressel) , which intends to sell the scientist to the highest bidder and his disintegrating artifact to best auction . In the course of the investigation , Dick meets beautiful women as Romy Kurtz (Evi Marandi) and Dolores (Mikaela) , who will help him find the professor . Along the way , Malloy travels various countries as France , Spain and Turkey to find out clues about the scientist taken by the mean kidnappers . Shortly after , Dick Malloy and the scientist&apos;s daughter , Romy , set out to track down the abducting and rescue the scientist located at a hot island . But Russian agents equally will go to an island to free the scientist . \n\n¨From Orient with Fury¨ or ¨Agent 077 operation Istanbul¨ is a Spanish-Italian co-production about secret agents very usual by that time of the 60s . The origin results to be the ¨James Bond¨ series that caused an authentic flood of copies , imitations and rip offs , each time more awful . With the explosion of ¨007 agent¨ on to the movie world in the early 60&apos;s and particularly : ¨James Bond against Dr No¨ and ¨From Russia with Love¨ (Terence Young) , every producer attempted to duplicate that exciting genre . This multinational effort is relatively amusing as well as fast paced and doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously . Fun and moving snapshot in time and place in which a secret agent undertaking dangerous missions , at the same time falling in love with gorgeous girls . One of the main main attractions of this picture is the continuous and rapid action . It keeps stirring , covering a great number of locals , such as gambling clubs , casinos , hotel pools , boats, ferries public , auctions gallery , public baths , and involves a lot of brawls and fights . Moving film in which there are nail-biting action scenes , intrigue , blasts , suspenseful set pieces and mediocre European stars , if not much continuity . While obviously not having the budget of ¨007¨ movies it does its best to exploit the Madrid , Paris and Istanbul scenery . An action-filled European thriller flick in which the brave protagonist falls in love for attractive women and there are some thrilling chases along the way before the final takes a slight twist . So-so thriller that follows the exploits and moving adventures of a rogue secret agent , the Muscular American actor Ken Clark , a former model, he appeared in &apos;tough&apos; western roles under contract to 20th Century Fox and then had a solid run as the second lead of several low-budget, cult science-fiction films in the 1950&apos;s ; he , subsequently , moved to Italy during the 60&apos;s to star in spaghetti westerns and sword and sandal epics . As he starred all kind of movies as &quot;Hercules Against the Barbarians&quot; , ¨Maciste against Mongols¨, ¨Charada international¨ , ¨Operation Lady Chaplin¨ , ¨Desert commando¨ , ¨The road to Fort Alamo¨ and ¨Ringo of Nebraska¨. Sympathetic acting by Ken Clark as a type of James Bond as well as a young and adventurous seducer stunningly accompanied by the really charming women as Margaret Lee , Evi Marandi and Mikaela . In the picture appears habitual actors of co-productions and being a Spanish production here shows up several notorious secondaries as Tomás Blanco , Lorenzo Robledo , Mikaela and the great Fernando Sancho , Spaghetti Western ordinary . And Italian actors , customary actors of this kind of genres , Spaghetti or Eurospy as Franco Ressel , Luciano Pigozzi , Pasquale Basile , among others . Evocative cinematography by Juan Julio Baena , including the exotic &apos;60s atmosphere , though a perfect remastering is necessary , because the film copy is washed-out . Being shot in Paris , Madrid ,Istambul that are widely and marvelously shown . Lively and catching musical score by Piero Piccioni , though including dated songs from the 60s . The picture has action packed , suspense , tension, thriller but with lackluster and no much budget . The film is fast movement besides it is developed in various scenarios though specially on Istambul and the hot island . However the movie is a bit boring and there are situations and images that are ridiculous and embarrassing . \n\nThis fast paced and action filled European spy flick was regularly directed by Sergio Grieco , he often used the pseudonym Terence Hathaway who directed several films in diverse genres , as adventures and action , especially . Sergio was a craftsman who made all kinds of genres as Thriller and Eurospy movies : ¨The beast with a gun¨ , ¨Rififí in Ámsterdam¨ ¨Charada international¨ , ¨Operation Lady Chaplin¨, ¨Assault to England Crown¨ , ¨Operation Mogador¨ ; Adventure and historical : ¨Sargento Klems¨ , ¨Una Spada Per l&apos;impero¨ , ¨Julio Caesar against pirates¨ ¨Salambo¨ , ¨Le Notti Di Lucrezia Borgia¨ , ¨La Regina Dei Tartari¨, ¨Il Capitano Di Ferro¨ , ¨Il Diavolo Nero¨ , ¨Lo Spadaccino Misterioso¨ and Nunsexploitation : ¨The sinful nuns of Saint Valentine¨.

Anything with Walter in it is bound to be good, and this film has a lot of excitement and chases in it.  As well as a catchy title song that you&apos;ll be singing in your head for weeks. Great for kids and grown-ups."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; joins &quot;The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover&quot; as being yet another film that doesn&apos;t even come close to living up to its inspired title.  All are bad enough to make me angry at the thought of a good title being squandered.\n\nKevin Williamson&apos;s script suggests nothing so much as a man trying, and failing, to capture the charm of the first couple of seasons of &quot;Buffy, the Vampire Slayer&quot; - this is more obviously a good description of &quot;Scream&quot;, but &quot;Scream&quot;, and this may surprise some people who&apos;ve seen it, is better.  -Or maybe he wasn&apos;t even trying.  I&apos;m not sure which is worse.  I think Williamson WAS trying for a quality we might term &quot;cred&quot;, by having his central characters bitch and squabble all the time.  Friends in &quot;Buffy&quot;, on the other hand, genuinely support one another.  That&apos;s a large part of the show&apos;s charm.  It&apos;s a  charm that could only have helped Williamson&apos;s script, if only by making it more realistic: however much his central characters might have fought amongst themselves in the ordinary course of events, faced with a powerful EXTERNAL threat, they would surely have closed ranks.\n\nNeither this nor &quot;Scream&quot; is particularly bad.  The main trouble is that &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, as well as wasting a good title, also wastes a good premise.  Some teenagers feel guilty after their car accidentally knocks someone down; they hide the body and then they THINK they can just safely sneak back to their old lives ... the story could have gone in many good directions from here, and it&apos;s a pity all that occurred to Williamson was to head for regions slasher-horror so well travelled I&apos;m surprised they don&apos;t sell souvenirs.",

Together with by best friend, I had my first experience of the short going to see Spiderman. At that age it actually looked good. But the second time we dared to make use of our teenage freedom, we went to this film. The theater was foul. The audience was delighted. We were laughing all the way to the end of the function and some even applauded when it was over.\n\nI never forgot this experience. All the movies that followed had to be compared with this one.\n\nBack in the &apos;80s, in Greece, this film became a legend. French comedies were predominant in those days and we knew French comedians better than their American colleagues. A whole fashion of school movies was provoked by the success of this idea and several bad taste local versions were produced.\n\nToday, apart from me and my friend, probably no one else remembers the comedy that thrilled the country. Personally I still wish for more.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Operation Scorpio&quot; is not one of the best HK action flicks you can find. The story is only mildly engaging, and at times utterly confusing. The martial arts choreography is unique and fascinating (in one of the fights, superhuman strength is pitted against superhuman agility; in another one, we have &quot;scorpio-style&quot; kung fu vs. &quot;eel-style&quot; kung fu!), but a bit too &quot;exaggerated&quot; for my tastes. I&apos;d say there is about 40% wirework and 60% physical skill involved, but even that percentage is still to be admired. One other thing the film lacks is star power: Chin Kar Lok is likable, but not strong enough to carry the entire film as a lead (but that girl he rescues is incredibly lovely). Overall, if you just skip to the last 20 minutes and the three main fights, you won&apos;t have missed much. (**)",
