Fassbinder&apos;s &apos;fox and his friends&apos; is one of my favourite ever films so i will always be open to a Fassbinder film. i will watch this film again because i really think there is something special going on. i shouldn&apos;t have drunk 8 beers before watching this complex work but like i said, i still enjoyed it which i think says something about Fassbinder.",

      "reviewBody": "I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.\n\nAnyway, I embraced the journey and I&apos;m glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:\n\nIn Greta Gerwig&apos;s latest directorial venture, &quot;Barbie,&quot; the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.\n\nWith Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig&apos;s live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.\n\nGerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie&apos;s role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.\n\nCan a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?\n\nGerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.\n\nIn reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I&apos;m giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie was that good, however Emma Watson acting is like subpar and a bit of monotone. Her Belle is kind of different with the sarcastic, cartoon Belle. I missed the belle expressive face when facing Gaston being narccisist he is.\n\nFor The cgi, the music, i like everything. It still one of the best princess remake of disney tho Belle is not really good. The thing is, this is fairy tale, and the dress doesn&apos;t look ethereal or magical enough nor does it looks correct to the history element. It can be a better dress, their first dance was supposed to be perfect, i guess disney need a better dress designer.\n\nI hate of why it is Yellow when its supposed to be GOLD and disney can make it with some roses texture since its her signature and there are lots of better dresses in the movie, plus beast clothes are very gorgeous and historically close, while belle one are so 2D, no depth in color and underwhelming. The castle and others were magical but hers are so badly designed. They didn&apos;t read the why the old designer design stuff that way, which i think too bad for supposed bookworm like emma.\n\nI like the new beast altho i love the old look more because of his underbite which is more beast-ly.\n\nBut still i really love the new one.\n\n*edit i just find out that the dress looks ugly bcs of emma watson bad influence, now i hate her more in this role. She is forever my favorite Hermione but, Belle is my favorite disney princess and she kind of ruined it with her Wokeism. Corsets are not bad if it is used for supporting posture, and can be comfy.",

I would say given the time it is made it would have been a classic horror movie with a high reputation if it was made in English.\n\nIf you require colors to think a movie is good then skip it. If you don&apos;t mind subtitles then I would suggest to give it a chance if you can find it.",

      "reviewBody": "I was pretty excited when this hit theaters. There was a lot of buzz floating around about it being the next great martial arts film. Unfortunately, for everything it does right, it does equal wrong.\n\nFor starters, this is a martial arts film, so you would assume there would be lots of fighting. And there is fighting, just not all that much. Most of the film is littered with lengthy dialogue scenes that are intended to deepen the characters, but this fails as well. Character motivation seems to be limited to &quot;spur of the moment&quot; reasoning and the ultimate plot is nothing more than standard fight-film fare (boy gets beat up a lot, boy trains, boy beats up everybody).\n\nThis isn&apos;t to say that the film doesn&apos;t have some positive aspects. The film is gorgeous; color, cinematography, lighting, all handled with expert flare. As for the fights (when the film gets around to them), they are excellent. Eskewing the modern trend penchant for treating fights like elaborate dance sequences, here instead we get some real hard-hitting brawls that also maintain a look of grace.\n\nIf only the filmmakers had put as much effort into the writing as they did into the look of the film, this could easily have been one of the top martial art films, instead of mild entertainment destined to be forgotten.\n\nScore: 6/10",

There are some\n\nunusual twists, mostly toward the end.  The special effects are on par with Kevin Connor&apos;s assorted 1970s monster flicks (e.g. The Land That Time Forgot,\n\nPeople that Time Forgot, At the Earth&apos;s Core, Warlords of Atlantis).  While many find those films to be entertaining and campy cheese, this film lacks their humor and spark.  Nevertheless, it is a decent enough time killer, but is probably not worth recommending to the vast majority of viewers.  For what it&apos;s worth,\n\nKenneth More is a credible Lindenbrock.  The rest of the cast is at least okay save for Pep Munne who plays Axel.  During an extensive rafting trip, I was\n\nreally hoping to see Axel slip overboard for the duration.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Most married couples can probably relate to the grind of a life absorbed with work and parenting. Sometimes the fantasy turns into having a quiet moment of solitude. Heck, even &quot;date night&quot; can devolve into just another responsibility tacked on at the end of a long week. This is the premise for director Shawn Levy&apos;s film. The best part? It doesn&apos;t matter at all.\n\nThe reason this film works is not the plot or script, but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today: Steve Carell and Tina Fey. The two seem to have an exceptional comedic connection that brings out a timing that reminds of the best comedy teams of all time.\n\nSometimes what makes for the funniest comedy is putting &quot;normal&quot; people into exceptional situations and let them react. Here, Carell and Fey are just a typical suburban couple trying to re-ignite the luster of an all too comfortable marriage. The motivation comes when their friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) announce they are splitting. This starts Carell and Fey off on a series of skits that would make Seinfeld proud.\n\nThe nightmare begins when the couple &quot;steals&quot; a reservation in a hot new restaurant and assume the identity of, what turns out to be a couple of low level thieves. The multitude of skits that follow include supporting work from dirty cops (Common and Jimmi Simpson), the real reservation holders (funny James Franco and Mila Kunis), a mob boss (Ray Liotta), a corrupt city official (William Fichtner) and a &quot;security expert&quot; in the eternally shirtless Mark Wahlberg.\n\nThe approach of the film reminds me of &quot;After Hours&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; and &quot;The Out of Towners&quot;. Some of the best comedy occurs when the main players aren&apos;t tossing out incessant one-liners. Think back to Cary Grant&apos;s screwball comedies. He was not a bumbling idiot or a stand-up comedian walking through life. His characters were reactionary to the odd-ball situations in which he was placed. That is the approach of Carell and Fey, and I hope they pursue future projects together.",

      "reviewBody": "Casino Royale is a major step-up from the flamboyant Die Another Day. Pierce Brosnan has been replaced by a young-ish Daniel Craig, there is no Q, no campy gadgets, no silly naked women silhouettes in the opening credits, no world-dominating super-colossus villains, no Miss Funnyfanny (or whatever), and no silly one-liners after killing bad guys. Basically everything that can date Bond film very quickly is gone. I never expected international espionage to look the way it has in past few Bond outings and I&apos;m glad someone had the balls to go back to the hard-edged nature of the series, last seen in Licence to Kill.\n\nThe longest Bond movie so far, at 145 minutes, but it breezes by even though it reigns in on the normally excessive action scenes and depicts spying a more &apos;mundane&apos; and &apos;realistic&apos; manner (or at least as true as the series has been so far). But the one-thing that bugs me about action movies, particularly the Bond franchise, is that they are, most of the time, childish male fantasies with an indestructible hero who has fun shooting up the place and beds beautiful women. I would like something new for a change but Casino Royale does have Bond get hurt and go through more pain than he has previously.\n\nDaniel Craig got a lot of hassle over his casting as Bond but not only does he have his youth as an advantage (he&apos;s the first 30-something to be cast in the role since Lazenby), he&apos;s also pretty damn trim, has the intensity Brosnan lacked and is surprisingly loose in a role that usually requires actors to be stiff and unemotional. It&apos;s also good to a fresh face in the role and who cares if he is blonde? Or the shortest actor to play him so far? I would have preferred that composer David Arnold went too. They didn&apos;t seem to be holding back on the amount of regular production team members who got axed. Even Vic Armstrong didn&apos;t return. I&apos;ve never liked Arnold&apos;s work on the movies and I hate to think of it as something that&apos;s now exclusively HIS baby.\n\nUnfortunately, as good as this fresh start to the franchise was, all of the goodwill that director Martin Campbell earned was completely undone by the follow-up Quantum of Solace, which is not only the worst Bond film so far, but one of the worst action films, and one of the worst films overall, that I have ever seen.\n\nIf Craig and Co. ever get around to making another, they&apos;ve got a LOT to make up for.",

Every guy wears white briefs by design, I guess and about every 10 minutes or so it&apos;s like ground hog the movie, just a different guy but same thing over and over again and again. I suppose the only reason this was put in a Gay category was because of the guys in it. \n\nThey seem to focus on the guys chest and nipples. NO nudity or anything close to it and I can&apos;t see how they spent ! million making it. I think a 1st year film student could have come up with a better story.

A fantastic supporting cast ... Honor Blackman, Jack Hawkins, Trevor Howard, Robert Morley ... are consistently wasted in this really annoying comedy. I usually love George, but she is nails- on-a-chalkboard annoying here.",

This is not a film classic like Gone with the Wind but for me much more enjoyable to watch.   As with many of Shelley Longs films it was full of heart and good intentions.  It was nice to see the mayor from Spin City playing the romance interest and he was very good in that role though I would have loved to have seen more of him and Shelley Long on the screen, and Santa was good as well.   If you like a film full of violence and sex this is not for you.   There were moral issues raised in this film but not heavily and they were helpful and valid as well. I do recommend that you have a hanky with you in the last 10 minutes of the film because I found it a real tear jerker.",

      "reviewBody": "In some restaurants, the chef goes out of his way to create complex dishes, with intricate combinations of tastes, colours and cooking styles. Others specialize in simple dishes, that stand out because of the quality of the ingredients. A simple pasta pesto can be a treat if it&apos;s made with the best olive oil, freshly grated parmesan and homegrown basil. \n\nUnder the Hawthorn Tree is like such a simple, but delicious dish. It&apos;s a straightforward story of a forbidden love, told in a basic way, without many frills. But Zhang Yimou is such a craftsman, that he doesn&apos;t need much to make a great movie. \n\nThe story is set during the cultural revolution, a period of ruthless oppression by the communist regime. The young girl Jing is being watched by the authorities because her father was a &apos;reactionary&apos; and she risks losing her job as a teacher. During a trip to the countryside she falls in love with Sun. Her mother is afraid the affair will harm Jing&apos;s future career, and she forbids the two lovers to see each other. \n\nZhang Yimou tells the story in a simple way, focusing on the two lovers. He uses title cards to make the story go forward, a smart move because it prevents the script from having to explain too much. In this way, Zhang concentrates on the story of Jing and her lover Sun, and nothing else. \n\nChina in the seventies was a country where people led simple lives. Zhang emphasizes this by using simple props, like a goldfish key-chain made of yarn and beads, or a metal bowl with a special decoration. The hawthorn tree from the title also has a symbolic meaning, and in the very last image of the movie, when we see the tree blossoming, Zhang has an unexpected surprise that will make you smile. \n\nThe acting is wonderful. The two leads tell just as much with their eyes, their laughs and their expressions as with their words. Take for example the scene where Jing gives her goldfish to Sun, and the camera lingers on their faces to show us how they feel. Wonderful film making. \n\nWith this film, Zhang Yimou returns to his earlier style of film making, telling stories about the daily life in China. Under the Hawthorn Tree has more in common with his lesser-known films like Not One Less or The Road Home, than with his visually more spectacular films like The House of Flying Daggers, or even Raise The Red Lantern. \n\nSome people may be disappointed by the slow story, in which nothing spectacular happens. But some of history&apos;s greatest film classics are slow and subtle. In a way, Under the Hawthorn Tree made me think of David Lean&apos;s classic Brief Encounter, another story about a forbidden love, that stands out because of the impeccable directing and acting.",

It&apos;s not terrific, but it definitely will tickle your funny bone if you&apos;re in the right mood.  The only real flaw is the soundtrack, which doesn&apos;t accentuate the humor enough.  If you enjoy comedies about cute moronic characters who are too blind to see their own faults, you will love this."

      "reviewBody": "I caught this one on Encore while staying home from school, and I was surprised at the many twists and Hitchcock-like additions. It was really entertaining.\n\nDoris Day plays the role of Kit, an American woman living in London with her businessman husband Tony. Almost immediately, we are introduced to the story of someone threatening her continuously, first in a fog-shrouded park, then over the phone, countless times. It gets progressively worse and worse, and Tony and her Aunt Bea, who has come to stay for a few weeks, begin to suspect the credibility in it all.\n\nThis is a great movie. Fans of Hitchcock may be impressed. And the acting is great. Doris Day is thoroughly convincing, especially when she begins to go hysterical at it all after Bea picks up the phone on the mysterious caller. But thoroughout the film, she plays a strong character. Bea is also a great character, and very amusing. Overall, the film does very well. The ending has many twists you don&apos;t think to suspect, though, I would have expected more with the scenes on the scaffolding. Oh well. Still, I recommend this film to all Hitchcock fans and anyone who likes older suspense movies. This one is great."

      "reviewBody": "Karan Johar&apos;s directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is one of those films you can always watch and enjoy with your family and friends. In spite of being a bit of a fairy tale, it works very well within its limitations. It is one of those beautiful Hindi romantic comedies that actually form the unique cultural and artistic style of Bollywood&apos;s most famous mainstream flicks. This is an enjoyable and charming picture which can make you laugh, cry, at times even cringe with annoyance, but then it will keep you consistently entertained.\n\nThe film introduces Johar&apos;s famous statement that the first step towards love is friendship and does it in a slightly cheesy yet rather convincing way. The film is a poignant story of two friends, a guy and a girl, who understand they actually love each other perhaps too late. And that&apos;s how it goes on. It flows well, with wonderfully composed songs, nicely written characters, several clichés here and there, many comic sequences, some melodramatic ones as well, but more importantly, a lot of Bollywood-style colour and fun.\n\nShahrukh Khan and Kajol work with electrifying chemistry. Their scenes together are pure magic. Both give crafted performances. Kajol is more impressive as the cool tomboy who transforms into a womanly, attractive and sensitive Anjali. She displays the pain, joy, happiness and confusion that her character goes through with great conviction. Shahrukh is fantastic as the young, cool guy, friend and boyfriend and later on as a loving and caring father who has lost his wife and suffers her loss.\n\nRani Mukherjee is beautiful and vibrant and makes for a very effective intelligent and dreamy girl. This is not an accomplished but very sincere performance which deserves full praise. Salman Khan is very good and surprisingly enough, manages to impress even in a brief, seemingly insignificant appearance. It may be because his character makes a great impact on the film&apos;s story and on the viewer. \n\nI really liked the film&apos;s music, the title song being my favourite, and among other songs, the melancholic &quot;Tujhe Yaad Na Meri Aayee&quot; is very beautiful. Towards the end, there are some overly melodramatic sequences but they flow well enough to bring the long-awaited ending. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is overall great entertainment and a must-watch for lovers of Hindi cinema and its films. It is compelling, moving and memorable, and is always fun to revisit. I recommend.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Abraham&apos;s Valley&quot; may be the most extraordinary achievement of Portuguese cinema which confirms that Manoel de Oliveira is among the world&apos;s greatest filmmakers capable of creating an unmistakably personal style and sensibility while depicting the human condition. I agree with the first comment which pointed out that one cannot speak of a direct adaptation of Flaubert&apos;s novel, but it should also be mentioned that de Oliveira – comparable to Robert Bresson and his film versions of Dostoyevsky&apos;s works – conveys the theme into his very own microcosm, and leaves the source material behind while at the same time maintaining key elements of the narrative and the ambivalence of the main character. \n\nThe rigid and formal aestheticism which de Oliveira had been developing throughout his long career doesn&apos;t require camera movements, and stands out due to a brilliant sense for composition that actually seems to owe a lot to the staging techniques of early silent cinema as well as the eclectic rigours of C. T. Dreyer and Straub/Huillet. The few times the camera moves it creates an amazing effect on the viewer, as if de Oliveira were re-inventing the effect.\n\nThe antique interior decorations and the spellbinding landscape of the Douro valley reshape the overall baroque but vital feel of a film which is constantly guided by an omniscient voice over that funds Flaubert&apos;s Emma and the one played by Leonor Silveira. &quot;Abraham Valley&quot; is in my opinion one of the most beautiful and authentic masterpieces of recent decades, but since the critical world doesn&apos;t seem to give much credit to Portuguese cinema in general (aside those co-productions which feature international stars) the viewer might be lucky enough to catch this film during a retrospective at a cinematheque.",

Rapidity, haste: that&apos;s what&apos;s in François&apos;s mind now. He wants to deliver mail as faster as he can into the small communities he crosses everyday\n\nThis film has surely got an easy-going atmosphere; the gags succeed and are never totally alike. The mosquito each time comes back when you don&apos;t expect it. François riding his bike always finds something different to get you laughing! If you are French, then you&apos;ll understand villagers&apos; peasant accent, and you won&apos;t miss to giggle! Some gags may remember you Charles Chaplin&apos;s ones, except that Jacques Tati used speech and colors, but dialogs almost escape notice, and colors aren&apos;t shocking.\n\nI recommend this one to Chaplin&apos;s fans and other film-lovers."

      "name": "A Hitchcockian Thriller Played For Laughs",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Silver Streak&quot; was released the very same year the Master of Suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, released his black-comedy swan song, &quot;Family Plot&quot;. Though Hitch was in the very twilight of his long, illustrious career, his playful style was alive and well, and well appropriated, in Hollywood. The Master didn&apos;t make this movie - Canadian Arthur (&quot;Love Story&quot;) Hiller did - but the unmistakable fingerprints and shop-hewn template of Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;North By Northwest&quot; (amongst other classics) are in great display thanks to writer Colin (&quot;Foul Play&quot;) Higgins in the cheery, breezy action comedy, &quot;Silver Streak&quot;.\n\n&quot;Silver Streak&quot; is the first of four Gene Wilder &amp; Richard Pryor match-ups and certainly in retrospect, one of the best. Wilder is an ordinary Joe taking the titular Amtrak train across country. In the midst of his journey, he befriends and beds fellow passenger Jill (&quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;) Clayburgh, ends up witnessing a murder then is wrongly accused of the crime, and is thrown off the train many, many times in his pursuit to clear his name, save the girl from a mysterious villain and get to the other side of the country.\n\nThis is a very gentle but funny comedy that plays with the conventions of one of Hitch&apos;s favorite themes, the mistaken identity of everyday man in extraordinary circumstances. Wilder is wonderful, fitfully funny as usual and shines as both a romantic lead (!) and does his patented &quot;crazy&quot; guy when things start falling apart. Just watching Wilder&apos;s eyes as he exasperatedly tries to explain out the fantastic plot he&apos;s wrapped up in to unbelieving characters along the way is one of the film&apos;s funniest, simplest rewards.\n\nThe film&apos;s masterstroke, however, is the addition of Richard Pryor as a part-time thief. Pryor was in the midst of a very hot career in 1976, and although this film seems to restrain some of the imagination and language of his stage presence and TV specials, (this is a PG-rated movie, after all), he still creates an indelible extended &apos;cameo&apos; that fuses film with a hip, perfectly cool counterbalance to Wilder&apos;s mania and confusion. When Pryor is on screen he not only steals the film, but also elevates this old-fashioned adventure-comedy concept to something otherwise original... and you can&apos;t take your eyes off the guy.\n\nFilmed all across his native Canada (thanks IMDb for confirming this!), director Hiller pulls this fun little audience-pleasing gem along the rails to a bright and exciting climax. The supporting cast is loaded with wonderful character actors including Patrick MacGoohan, Ray (My Favorite Martian) Walston, Ned Beatty and Scatman Crothers amongst others. A very luxurious and memorable score by Henry Mancini is the capper to this sparkling comedy, perfect as a primer for, and a loving compendium of, many of the Hitchcock classics that wait for you to discover them on DVD, VHS or on the tube.",

      "reviewBody": "The first time I saw this film I had just finished the book. Simply loved the book and I was really looking forward to the movie adaptation. At first I found myself disappointed. The problem according to me was how they had handled the material. The movie just felt like a too trimmed down and simplified adaptation. I understand that you can&apos;t bring the entire book to the big screen, but this felt rushed and simple. Character that felt vastly different to their counterparts in the book. It took quite some time before I saw the film again. I decided to try being more objective, not keep irritating myself over the changes. Take it for what it is and not what it could and maybe should have been. I´ve seen it several times since often with long breaks between, meaning years. It seems each time I see it I like it more. Now I think it´s one of the best Swedish thrillers, at least of the ones I have seen. A really gripping movie about criminal underworld, themes of social status, gripping characters and thrilling events. This is a brutal film not just in the action but also the plot. It feels very realistic even if I don´t really know anything about the stuff. The author of the book has personal experience of the world he writes about. The acting is very good. Excellent casting choices. Not only in their performances but they really feel believable in this world. Joel Kinnaman is pretty much as I imagined JW and Matias Varela it totally believable. The actor which makes the best performance is Dragomir Mrsic, his performance is great and his is the most gripping character. The action is among the best in a Swedish movie. Visually great with suspense at the highest. Brutal and tense without overdoing it. Not wanting to bad mouth Swedish movies but the production is really on top. I think that even if you are not familiar with the book you will have little problem in following the plot. The pace is fast but not too much. It still gives time to give us understanding of the characters. Which is totally necessary as the characters are just as interesting as the events they are in, maybe even more so.\n\nSnabba Cash is a brutal, realistic, tense and gripping. They have done a movie that I think does the book justice but also works very well as a movie on its own.",

      "name": "Farhan Akhtar has raised the bar for future sequels and action thrillers. Great performance by Shahrukh in the best Indian sequel so far!",
      "reviewBody": "In 2006, Sanjay Gadhvi made a sequel to the 2004 hit &apos;Dhoom&apos; which was appreciated by most, but Rohit Shetty&apos;s sequel to &apos;Golmaal&apos; faced mixed reviews. However, Rajkumar Hirani got it compeletely right with the Munna Bhai sequel, which was the perfect sequel to the first film. So it can be said that the record hasn&apos;t been all that great.. but it has certainly got better now!\n\nFarhan Akhtar&apos;s Don 2 is a sequel to his 2006 movie Don, a remake of the 70s Amitabh film. However, the story was sufficiently different and the twists in the tale left viewers gasping for more. Five years later, Farhan Akhtar has returned in an attempt to fulfill the enormous expectations on this sequel. I can say that my expectations were not only met but surpassed by a considerable distance!\n\nThe story is strong and pretty special considering what we have previously seen from the Hindi film industry, but you wouldn&apos;t expect anything less from Farhan Akhtar. After conquering the Asian underworld, Don sets his eyes on Europe. Thrills are what you expect and thrills are what you get!\n\nThe makers have clearly gone to town here as the level of authenticity and realism is extraordinary, especially considering that there are quite a few formulaic Hindi films released every year that fail to differ hugely from films that have come out of India before them. This is certainly one of those films that possess their own distinct identities.\n\nThe performances are great. Shahrukh excels as Don and everything about his character is just awe-inspiring. I think this role is comparable with some of his best performances. Meanwhile, Priyanka Chopra too excels and Om Puri shows why he is regarded as a good actor. Boman Irani is impeccable as Vardhaan and Nawwab Shah is a revelation - watch out for him! Kunal Kapoor handles his role with ease, and is another one too look out for. The character development is superb.\n\nThe dialogues are really good. They fit in and serve their purpose in a variety of situations.\n\nThe songs of this film are not really the commercial type, but they fit in well in the various situations throughout the film. With this in mind, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have done a solid job with the music. The background score is great.Those who expect romantic music will be disappointed.\n\nThe action sequences have been finely executed and do fit into the narrative very nicely. They really do add to the overall experience.\n\nOverall, this is a sequel that is far superior to the first film. As an action thriller with world-class action, top notch performances and a western feel, this presents further proof that Hollywood has some serious competition. It&apos;s a gem of a film from Farhan Akhtar, who I regard as one of the top 5 best directors in India today. With Shahrukh delivering a great performance, this film will not disappoint fans of his and action enthusiasts. One of the best films (not just from India) of 2011! A must watch!!\n\n9.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Guilt while laughing is an unusual experience ... well except while watching Lars and Bianca. This film is hilarious, touching and insightful. The product of genius writing by Nancy Oliver (Six Feet Under) and solid direction by Craig Gillespie (&quot;Mr. Woodcock&quot;), this film will force you to step back and think about how you treat those who might be a little different or struggle with social interaction.\n\nRyan Gosling is absolutely amazing as Lars. His character redefines &quot;being in a shell&quot;. Wounded by the pain of losing his parents and literally frightened by human touch, Gosling exudes the humanity of a injured child. The real guilty fun starts once Bianca is delivered. Bianca is the anatomically correct molded doll whom Lars treats as a real girlfriend. The ride picks up steam when his relatives and then the entire town elect to play along.\n\nThe entire cast is excellent with standout performances by Emily Mortimer (&quot;Match Point&quot;), Paul Schneider, the great Patricia Clarkson as the very wise and very human doctor, and Kelli Garner (&quot;Thumbsucker&quot;) looking very homely as the co-worker with a crush on Lars.\n\nNot sure how wide of audience this will find, but I highly recommend to all adults ... it is not a film for kids. Hopefully the academy takes notice of the film, the writing and the acting ... all top notch.",

I&apos;ve said this countless times that I find Michael Moore to be a very talent filmmaker and I think he makes very entertaining films but there&apos;s no denying that he&apos;s a hypocrite and lies just as much as the people he goes after. This documentary tells Moore&apos;s story from his high school days all the way up to the release of his controversial film and the funny thing is that when this documentary is released, there&apos;s even more lies out in the open. Moore&apos;s use of fear is something that he often tries to go for yet he uses this against people claiming they use fear to push their points. In 2004 Moore was saying the draft was coming yet here we are four years later and this appears to have been a use of fear to try and sell your point. Another thing that I&apos;m glad got cleared up was the heated debate over the Charlton Heston sequence in Bowling for Columbine. I&apos;ve always felt Moore crossed the line in this segment and we get to see that the original speech from Heston was not made days after a little kid was killed but four months before it. There&apos;s a lot of debate on whether Moore really believes in freedom of speech but I&apos;ll let the clips in the movie speak for themselves. I&apos;m not sure if this movie was made to make one hate Michael Moore but it really didn&apos;t change my mind of the mind. I still think he&apos;s a great talent but as far as calling him a documentary filmmaker is a joke. There are three legendary documentary makers interviewed here and their comments are priceless."

The truly unbelievable thing was the casting of Herbert Marshall as Rogers Woodruff.  Hard to imagine one woman, let alone two having such rapturous feelings for that character.  Perhaps there&apos;s the reality in this story.  After all, these things are rarely understood.  I found, in this case, &quot;When Ladies Meet&quot;, to be quite entertaining and being a die-hard Greer Garson fan, I highly recommend it!!",

However, rewatching it today I&apos;m impressed what a clever little movie this is. Going into a genre which is clearly beyond its budget, arming its heroes only with a bucket of water, it plays virtuously on the classic doppelganger theme. Again and again, aliens and their flying saucer appear, but who will believe the eyewitnesses that they are among us? Cruchot and his team on their 5th mission (of 6 in total) are fighting an amusing battle, dedicated to the max. The flick was definitely better than I remembered it.",

I was already a Bud Tingwell fan from watching Catweazel, I liked John Hargreaves and I will always be a Chris Haywood fan.\n\nThis movie just hits the spot, simple, quirky, very very funny and with a bit of romance.\n\nColin Friels plays the simple and innocent, but brilliant Malcolm to a tee.\n\nTo some probably a forgotten gem, to me an old favourite that I have had the pleasure of watching many many times.",

      "reviewBody": "... before she was even well known! The outline makes this romantic movie sound like it could be a heavy melodrama: Mack Hale (George Brent) is a self-made construction engineer with no soft edges working on the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge - no person will get in the way of the construction of this monument. Lynn Palmer (Kay Francis) is a social worker with the Traveler&apos;s Aid Society - no monument will get in the way of her helping people. These two knew each other years ago when Lynn was 15 and renew their friendship and romance when Mack comes to the Traveler&apos;s Aid looking for one of his ace employees (Robert Barat as Stanislaus Janauschek) who has a bad habit of buying a train ticket back to Chicago to see his wife every time he gets drunk.\n\nAfter the two begin dating, Mack begins to resent the fact that Lynn is constantly having their dates interrupted by this or that emergency at Traveler&apos;s Aid, and tells her that she is wasting her time trying to help people who &quot;had their chance in life and couldn&apos;t cut it&quot;. Only when Mack is facing being ousted as construction engineer due to a protection racket that is causing trouble among his workers does he suddenly realize that no man is an island and everyone can use some help now and again. Although, like the congressman who suddenly becomes a champion of improving prison conditions after he goes to jail, his transformation seems a bit self-serving. \n\nAs in their other films, Kay and George have wonderful chemistry from the moment they are first on screen together. The film does give Kay an excuse for her gorgeous fashions and spacious apartment considering she is a social worker probably getting minor renumeration in exchange for her hard work - She has an independent income and is free to choose how she spends her time.\n\nOne of the most humorous scenes in the film is when Lynn is supposed to be on a date with Mack and she has to make &quot;a few stops&quot; first on behalf of her job. The two end up sharing a car with four giggling immigrant brides Lynn must deliver to their grooms and an expectant mother who has been abandoned by her husband that Lynn must take to the maternity hospital, with Mack&apos;s impatient comments being hilarious.\n\nThis is one of Kay Francis&apos; most likable roles as she deals sympathetically with all of the poor souls tossed about by the Depression, and could have been one of Brent&apos;s most unlikeable ones, but like Lynn, the audience realizes underneath all of that bluster is a good person just waiting to get out. I highly recommend this little programmer for fans of films of the 1930&apos;s.",

I find it impossible to find any way of excusing this nasty little piece of cinema by saying that it has some thought provoking undercurrent quite simply because it doesn&apos;t.\n\nThe story is of a couple arriving on a Greek island and instantly punishing the local residents for what the male lead see as sinful behaviour. Amongst the supposed sins are adultry (an ironic one given the nature of the stars vengence), homosexuality, lesbianism, drug-abuse and....well being a goat.\n\nThe scenes of violence are rather tame compared to many films of its time let alone some of the blood-soaked mainstream movies about today. But it is not the violence that shocks about this film still today. It is more so the notion of the acts commited and the seemingly pointlessness of them.\n\nSome have called it a nasty little gem, others have found it to be over-hyped and rather dull, I however found it to be a classic piece of exploitation cinema. If you can&apos;t enjoy the film for it&apos;s visual acuity, I defy anyone not to enjoys its heavy seventies kitsch soundtrack, Classic."

      "reviewBody": "While I think that everyone should see this film because of its vitally important subject matter, I feel that because of lax editing and meandering, incomplete story telling, it was much less effective than it should have been.\n\nAs just one example, and I have been studying Nazi persecution of homosexuals, the movie briefly refers to a gay man&apos;s friend who was killed by German Shepherd dogs in front of 300 people. I read a similar account on the Internet (I suspect it was the same case), in which graphic details were given of the brutality of the crime, details which, if you heard or read about, you would never forget. To just gloss over this compelling tale in the manner the movie does is inexcusable. How can one understand the true horror when it is glossed over.\n\nAdditionally, one of the major points of this film should be how many gay concentration camp victims were still treated as prisoners after the war, specifically because of Paragraph 175. It is barely a footnote in the movie. This is inexplicable to me.\n\nWhat is good is having a record of living survivors of gay detention during the Holocaust. It remains the reason for seeing this movie. But the narrative is very meandering and a few of the lingering close-ups of some of the survivors breaking down almost feels exploitative.\n\nBottom line: because of the important subject matter and the live interviews the film needs to be seen. I just wish it had been made more coherently. A film with this type of material will always be powerful. It could have been far more so had it been made by better filmmakers.",

The writing has nothing new and lacks funny jokes. The biggest problem may be Nikki Reed. She looks sexy in skimpy outfits but doesn&apos;t excel in comedic roles. She&apos;s better as the femme fatale. The movie is not quite dark enough to push the envelop of black comedies. This is all very familiar and simply less than good.",

But that thing is going to be done far better in New Police Story three years later.\n\nProbably the worse thing in this production is the scenario and the political goals. In a world where young people of low qualification and of foreign descent hardly gets any employment, in a world where most young people of that region can&apos;t find steady jobs even with good genes and an education, well, all the Yamakasi are employed if they don&apos;t have anything better to do. In this fantasy dimension the police knows them, wants them, yet they can&apos;t get them at home as they do in real life France.\n\nAnd if the prototype of the idiot is the cop in most bad taste jokes, the maghrebin cop has no contact with the outside world. He&apos;s precisely the virgin who&apos;s trying, hard, to run a brothel.\n\nReally, if there wasn&apos;t the purpose of propaganda nobody would have produced such junk. But, hey, the whole nation can see the darkies have it all: a fair chance for transplant, friendly police and jobs to choose from. It&apos;s only their evil nature that stands in the ways of friendship between the white majority and the others. And to keep things simple for the target audience to be able to follow the simple ideas they are fed all the targets live in the area of the same police district and the same cops are on duty on each event.\n\nMyself, I&apos;m disgusted.\n\nContact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"

It is short and seems simple, but there are sometimes strange things happening: has anybody the strength to go straight?  If one does really go straight, one probably do not even have dreams.  Dreams, wishful thinking and miracles like the improbable solution (by a little girl) for getting the bus out of the river with an ox instead of a tractor and the small miracle of the two vehicles that for no apparent reason suddenly CAN pass each other on the narrow path after a short meeting.  Furthermore, Buñuel incorporates a few modest but funny dream sequences to emphasize that people (secretly) can think of other things, while they are on their certain way to heaven (the righteous path?). The English title &apos;Mexican Bus Ride&apos; applies very well I guess: the whole is kind of low profile (probably also low budget :)\n\nThe acting is ok, but I never really got into the story, because the editing isn&apos;t good and there is no convincing mood to get into, although Buñuel uses some music in this movie.  Miniature cars and sets make it fun to watch, but also do not convince.  The movie feels more like an exercise than as a message from the heart, but I would like to see it again some time. 5/10"

      "reviewBody": "Directed by Kin-Lung Lam, &quot;49 Days&quot; presents a tale of tragedy and perseverance set against the backdrop of urban China. Despite its slow pace, the film captivates audiences with its extraordinary background score, offering a hauntingly immersive experience.\n\nThe story follows Lau Sing, portrayed by Stephen Fung, who ventures from his provincial home to the bustling city with aspirations of success in the pharmacology business. However, his dreams are shattered when a malevolent gambler sets fire to his establishment, resulting in the loss of his friends and fortune. Accused of the crime, Lau Sing finds himself entangled in a legal battle, fighting to clear his name and seek justice for his fallen comrades.\n\n&quot;49 Days&quot; may initially appear sluggish due to its deliberate pacing and subdued narrative. However, what it lacks in frenetic action, it compensates for with its atmospheric tension and emotional depth. The film&apos;s strength lies in its ability to evoke a sense of foreboding and unease, drawing viewers into Lau Sing&apos;s harrowing journey of loss and redemption.\n\nWhile the performances of the cast, including Gillian Chung and Steven Cheung, are commendable, it is the masterful use of sound that truly elevates &quot;49 Days.&quot; The background score, composed with precision and artistry, permeates every scene, intensifying the mood and heightening the suspense. Without resorting to gratuitous violence or gore, the film manages to instill a profound sense of dread, leaving a lasting impact on its audience.\n\nAs a horror aficionado, I approached &quot;49 Days&quot; with skepticism, expecting a run-of-the-mill supernatural thriller. However, I was pleasantly surprised by its ability to elicit genuine fear and apprehension, even without traditional horror tropes. Watching the film alone in the darkness of my room, the haunting melodies and eerie ambiance succeeded in sending shivers down my spine, a feat few movies have achieved.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;49 Days&quot; may not be for everyone, particularly those seeking fast-paced action or explicit scares. However, for those willing to immerse themselves in its atmospheric world and appreciate the power of subtle storytelling, it offers a deeply affecting cinematic experience. With its exceptional background score and understated performances, &quot;49 Days&quot; proves to be a haunting journey worth embarking on.",

      "reviewBody": "Christian Bale is an actor who is never orthodox. His string of films have in general been breaking moulds and testing his own ability, and more often than not you leave the cinema thinking that you had seen something special.\n\nHaving revived the Batman series and out-Lynched David Lynch in &quot;The Machinist&quot;, he has now tackled the troubled life of a war veteran who is trying to find a job in order to be able to settle down so he can marry and bring over his wife from Mexico. Alongside him is his best friend who is also in the same situation of finding a job but this time in order to satisfy his frustrated working wife. As always nothing goes as easily to plan.\n\nThe two lead actors end up struggling through job rejections, life, gangs, drugs and drinks, and also the struggle to move on from their carefree lifestyle when they were young. Responsibility is a difficult option for the pair of them. The problem is exacerbated by Christian Bale&apos;s character&apos;s flashbacks and hauntings to the war, which add a frightening and unstable edge to his character.\n\nThe film overall takes us on an unpredictable journey following the two men questioning ourselves what we would do if we were in their shoes, and watching the pair of them acting and opting for what they do can be unsettling. Acting is great, direction is interesting and you will not be disappointed. If you like Crash, then in some ways this is in the same vein but not alike to the movie. I thoroughly was interested and enjoyed this movie, and if you want a thought-provoking film then this is definitely for you.",

After meeting him while working, she has a one night fling with him and somehow decides she wants to live in his newly built house. The only problem is Newton Davis (Martin&apos;s character) has no clue to what she&apos;s up to. The tricky predicaments she places Martin and herself in, are a treat to watch....a zany, clever comedy in my opinion. Please don&apos;t be misled by the rating on IMDb, because it really is an injustice....it is an enjoyable movie.\n\nMy vote 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife is a romantic drama directed by Robert Schwentke, adapted from Audrey Niffenegger&apos;s bestseller of the same name. Adapting a novel with complex elements and undertones to the silver screen is a daunting task and director Robert Schwentke struggled to compromise between satisfying readers of the novel and making the movie accessible to people unfamiliar with the book. Overall, the movie has some significant directing and screen writing flaws but does make for an unpretentious and above-average romantic tragedy thanks to its two compelling leads.\n\nSypnosis: The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife is the time-defying love story of Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams). Henry is a librarian afflicted with a genetic disease that causes him to travel through time more or less randomly. Henry&apos;s random and unpredictable escapades are often dangerous, terrifying and sometimes life-threatening ordeals because he ends up buck-naked and starving in unknown places and times. For those reasons, Henry keeps himself in top physical shape and taught &quot;himself&quot; all type of survival skills such as pick-pocketing, street fighting, or picking locks. After a random while, he always goes back to his &quot;present&quot; but is largely unable to affect his future. At age 28, he meets 20-yr old Clare Abshire. He doesn&apos;t know her but she has known him since she was 6 and has been waiting for him all her life and will do so the rest of her life...\n\nThe main weaknesses of the movie can be traced back to trying to fit the book into 107 minutes. Director Robert Schwentke and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin appeared a bit over-matched and took the path of least resistance, oversimplifying the plot and characters. The book was a bit confusing at times because of its particular narrative structure and the movie inherits the same problem. Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin made some compromises to keep the movie from becoming excessively long or inaccessible to its PG-13 audience. The main events and characters of the book were translated to the big screen although non-essential characters such as Kimi or Ingrid were completely omitted and the ending was slightly altered (and I liked it). The supporting characters are a mere passing thoughts, the key relationship between Clare and Gomez is one-dimensional. Even the two main characters, Henry and Clare, are under-developed. Ideally, the direction of the movie should have been given to a director with better credentials, and the movie extended up to 140 minutes to develop the characters fully and take advantage of the terrific cast.\n\nDespite those shortcomings, The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife is one of those movies you can&apos;t help but like. It is at heart a simple star-crossed love story with a refreshing sci-fi twist that touches on universal themes such as fate/free will, true love, and loss. A story that focused on the depth of the characters&apos; love, not its showiness. Their will to move forward and enjoy every minute they have with each other before Henry&apos;s impending fate. This meant more close-up shots and a deeper and more realistic exploration of what it means to be Henry and Clare. The movie succeeds in moving the audience thanks in big part to moving performances from the two leads, who surrendered themselves fully to the premise of the novel.\n\nThe Time Traveler&apos;s Wife features the graceful Rachel McAdams as the title character. Most will have missed her terrific performance in the 2008 indie the Lucky Ones and this puts her back on the radar for mainstream audiences. Beside matching the description of Clare in the book, McAdams has an unusual ability to make her characters feel real against all odds. Overcoming an underwritten character, she carries the emotional weight of the movie and was luminous portraying Clare&apos;s spirit and unyielding love for Henry&apos;s despite being riddled with some terrible lines once again. Will someone give Rachel McAdams a meatier role for God&apos;s sake??? Eric Bana was a big surprise, exceeding my expectations and making for a very solid Henry. Although he does not fit the physical description of the book (Henry is more runner than football player) Bana&apos;s Henry was tormented, introverted, poignant, and more importantly, had considerable chemistry with his co-star. The only issue I had was that Henry was mostly a one-note character. The supporting cast was solid albeit given very little opportunity to be memorable. Gomez (Ron Livingstone) was a pivotal character in the book but merely a passing thought in the movie. Jane McLean as Charisse, Arliss Howard as Henry&apos;s father, Stephen Tobolowsky as Dr. Kendrick all did a fine job with the small parts they had.\n\nThe cinematography has a beautiful stark and cold quality to it which reinforce the tragic nature of the movie. The movie was beautifully shot by Florian Ballhaus and is the strongest attribute of the movie behind its leads. The crafty camera-work using motion and placement selection gave a particular tone to his scenes and Schwentke used that to his advantage in the film, giving the movie a light touch of fantasy. He created a nice immersing atmosphere that really highlighted Clare and Henry&apos;s impending fate. The CGI effects of Henry&apos;s time traveling are unspectacular but first rate while the overused musical score was melancholic, adding to the tragic tone of the movie.\n\nEnjoy the Time Traveler&apos;s Wife for what it is: an endearing love story with an unusual sci-fi premise. It may not be exactly like the book, it may have been darker and heavier on the sci-fi, and it may have been so much more with better direction. Even so, the premise of the story, and the perfectly-cast leads make this movie well-worth the ride and will keep your imagination lingering long afterward.\n\nB+: Boasting terrific performances and chemistry from Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana, the Time Traveler&apos;s Wife has some flaws but is a charming, endearing and bittersweet romantic drama nonetheless.\n\nhttp://anomalousmaterial.blogspot.com/",

Like &quot;Open Water&quot; this is a true story, which helps in the enjoyment of this. There really isn&apos;t much more to say about this movie, not too much to it, but it is entertaining. Overall, I liked it, but if you have seen &quot;Open Water&quot; this may be too much of the same thing to fully enjoy it.

Combining unknown actors with a very simple script is a recipe for disaster, in general,BUT not in this film.

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s something unique to film, something relatively new in the word that has had profound effect on how we relate to art.\n\nI call it noir, and define it a bit differently than the ordinary fellow, who thinks it has something to do with dark shadows and unhappy endings.\n\nFor me, noir is centered on the idea that the camera represents our eyes; that the nature of the world we see is bent by us watching it; and that the fate of the characters in that world are arranged  sometimes by extreme coincidence  for our purposes. The extreme photography is an indicator of that eye, and not necessarily a characteristic of noir. The camera might not be cinematically introduced, though of course it usually is.\n\nI&apos;m interested in the evolution of noir because its right at the edge of how we construct narrative, how we experiment with ideas and the stories we swim in. But what does a filmmaker do if that edge is always moving? Nearly every film I see that was made recently has some twist on the exploration  this is how genres mature today, and how we build tools to see ourselves.\n\nFor some reason, its the Spanish-speaking filmmakers that are doing the most interesting work in pushing this further, and effectively. \n\nWhat Iñárritu does is especially adventurous. I particularly appreciate it because instead of rattling around in established cinematic conventions, he&apos;s trying to extend to new ones. Well, not precisely new, but newly recast. I like his idea of narrative braiding, but that&apos;s only part of his adventure on the edge. Its what he leaves out that matters. The absences aren&apos;t noticed because of the way things are sliced and respliced. And people think the story is important, which of course it isn&apos;t, just a pointer: here generally misinterpreted as miscommunication. Deliberately so, I think.\n\nThose elided parts mean that we fill in more of the story than usual, that the container of a long form film can be bigger than usual. That it presents an open world. What&apos;s new for Iñárritu is the notion of referring to large sweeps of society as metaphors; and also new is the idea of lacing watchers in the story, here a disembodied global TeeVee audience. They &quot;watch&quot; but of course see almost nothing of what we see. \n\nIts about listening transformed into watching; each of the three threads involves watching. The Japanese episode of course literally has watching as listening and the lasting trauma of what has been seen. The Morrocan episode is triggered by a boy spying on his nude, colluding sister, and on the Brad Pitt side about a reluctant busload of watchers. The Mexican story has a woman going to see her son&apos;s wedding and having trouble with being seen clumsily.\n\nSight. Made explicit of course by the cinematic flourishes, the deliberate differences in the three camera stances, whose differences penetrate to primitives beyond grain, light, stance to the soul of the eye. Its as if Iñárritu decided to create three of the most elementary braids of sight he possibly could with the notion that their cleanliness would allow them to braid into a larger container than any other film.\n\nIts one of the most exciting things happening. Almost thankfully he underused Cate, who is one of the few actresses who could hint that everything other than her we see is in her mind. Almost thankfully he underplays the merger into one soul of three wonderful actresses. \n\nAlmost, but not quite thankfully, he only hints at the notion of detective work, three types of discovery.\n\nIts delicate, good, rich, dangerous without seeming so.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Yes, it&apos;s a comedy with zombies but that is as far as the similarities go. Based on a manga comic with the same name, apparently, the story is mainly about two workmates and their obsession with Jujitsu. Only there&apos;s a zombie apocalypse (yawn) so they&apos;re constantly having to deal with fighting off the living dead. Unless you are a fan of Japanese horror/comedy then this may not be your cup of tea. It is funny at times, tedious at others. Bizarre, or silly, is an apt description. There is plenty of violence but it&apos;s more comical than gory, tame enough for a 15 certificate (UK)",

Wounded Yankee soldier Eastwood is rescued from the field by several southern school girls. He finds himself in an isolated all girls school surrounded by young ladies from about 10 years old up to the middle aged school mistress. Kinky! Crushes and jealousy kick in as Eastwood attempts to get as much mileage out of his situation as he can. He&apos;s a nasty man, but these are some nasty girls. I remember when this came out at the drive-in. No one really knew what to make of it. A few months later &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was released and this out of step Clint Eastwood movie just disappeared. That&apos;s a shame. It&apos;s something really different. Directed by Eastwood&apos;s longtime collaborater Don Segal, the film has a highly stylized look and feel to it. It&apos;s just plain creepy and that feeling never lets up. There are no good guys or bad guys, just nasty people trying to take advantage of other nasty people who in turn grow nastier and nastier as the movie progresses. It doesn&apos;t cover all the ground the book did. (I read it during a tour of jury duty some years ago.) But it moves at a good pace and it&apos;s sometimes complicated plot stays reasonable easy to follow. (The book was very hard to keep straight!) Creepy and nasty and very different. Well worth a look, especially by Eastwood fans."

It is a simple and systematic explanation of how Fox works and why they report what they do.\n\nMy politics are decidedly all over the place. I am neither wholly liberal nor wholly conservative, it all depends on the subject. I do regularly watch Fox because I do like some of their reporting. However after seeing this I&apos;m left to question everything that they do on every level. Fair and unbiased indeed.\n\nThe film is light years better than the earlier &quot;Uncovered&quot; about the Iraq War. I would say that its a perfect position paper against Fox News except for the final ten minutes or so where the film shifts focus and asks the viewer to become active in changing how news is reported. Its a valid track to take, but it somehow takes away from the films central point of Fox&apos;s biased reporting.\n\n9 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "For an example of a fun movie to spend an hour with, see TRAPPED BY TELEVISION from 1936. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you want to spend that hour in abject misery you should watch ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A. from 1961. I can&apos;t say it&apos;s the worst movie I&apos;ve ever seen (that dishonor belongs to another) but it is most definitely one of the worst. I watched these two movies hour-long movies of bygone eras (TRAPPED BY TELEVISION and ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A.) back-to-back the other day and the two of them could not have been more different. ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A. is a spy movie for people who hate spy movies. And movies in general. And life. It opens with Russia&apos;s launch of Sputnik satellite into orbit and jumps immediately to the United States Department of Defense where people are worried that it will be used to collect data for the enemy. The decision is made to waste no time dropping a central intelligence agent, John Manston (John McKay), behind enemy lines to meet with a Soviet defector named Tanya (Monica Davis). Tanya will use her connections inside the Russian government as an official&apos;s mistress to get information on Sputnik&apos;s true purpose and the potential likelihood of an attack on the United States. Then a bunch of nothing happens, your interest most like declines to the point of physical pain, and after a while we get the inevitable missile attack against the United States in a film that I assume was meant to scare the American population into hating Russia even more.\n\nI don&apos;t know if I&apos;m even justified in commenting on this horrible, horrible film because, despite having actually seen it twice now (and this I promisenever again), I have no real idea what goes on once John makes contact with Tanya in Moscow because this movie is so incredibly dull and so horribly executed that I am incapable of keeping interest. I might be looking at the screen as the movie is playing but my attention begins dropping off exponentially until I&apos;m left glassy-eyed and slack-jawed. I&apos;m essentially comatose for twenty or thirty minutes until finally something of interest happens in the film and John sneaks (unsuccessfully) onto a Russian military base and finds the missiles locked and loaded for assault on the United States. Then we shift over to New York City where we spend some time getting to know a bunch of regular folk for a few minutes in a desperate attempt to add emotional weight to the final few minutes of the film. I haven&apos;t managed to find any sort of confirmation but, from the quality and content of ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A., it reeks of anti-Soviet propaganda. I really want to know if this movie was developed and released to help fuel the average American&apos;s fear of the Russians. Or maybe it&apos;s not and director Barry Mahon was venting some of his own personal fears through this film. I don&apos;t know and I&apos;ve already stopped caring. Regardless of what ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A. was supposed to be, it&apos;s garbage. Unwatchable garbage.\n\nI mean, come onit&apos;s just so poorly done. Movies had been around long enough that we had an understanding of character development, story structure, drama and creating tension. This uses absolutely none of it. The only characters we spend any real time with are Manston and Tanya, and I couldn&apos;t care less about either. John McKay seems as if he&apos;s genuinely trying to act in a spy film (and failing) while Monica Davis may as well have been pulled in off the street. She&apos;s just bad. So, right off the bat, I don&apos;t care about the characters. What about the story? If it&apos;s interesting enough, I might be able to forgive some of the film&apos;s other problems. Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Story&apos;s crap. What little bit I walked away with, anyway. You see, most of the film&apos;s exposition is delivered in droning voice-over narration. And some of the character motivation, too. Seeing as how no one in this film bothers to act, the narrator is left with the job of telling us how characters are feeling. It&apos;s insufferable and impossible to follow as a result. I dare you to find anyone who&apos;ll enjoy this movie non-ironically. Because this movie fails on so many levels, I can&apos;t see it being effective propaganda because I can&apos;t imagine anyone sitting through this movie at full attention. If anything, ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A. could&apos;ve been used to torture suspected Communist sympathizers into confession. Just stay away from this movie. Or don&apos;t. I don&apos;t care. But just remember I warned you.\n\n**ROCKET ATTACK U.S.A. Fun Fact: director Barry Mahon and &quot;actress&quot; Monica Davis went on to create a bunch of old-timey porn sounding movies (not necessarily together) including 1000 SHAPES OF A FEMALE, SIN IN THE CITY, UNHOLY MATRIMONY, and RUN SWINGER RUN.",

Why not use your &quot;talents&quot; in writing about what you LIKED about these Prime videos from Amazon? It has gotten so bad that I ignore most comments and go by the cast, directors and general plots. Just realized that I did not write enough to submit a review. OK, the actress who played Julie (Marie Villepin) is a heartthrob and the life of the Kazakhs and their beautiful carpets is very enlightening and attractive.",

      "reviewBody": "Have been on a roll re-visiting and watching Russian/Soviet film, for interest and nostalgia reasons, especially fantasy. Having started watching a lot, mostly fantasy and animation, six years ago and getting such a lot out of it. Some of which have touches of comedy and a good deal of which also being surreal. Have seen a good deal of director Aleksandr Rou&apos;s work, and have liked to loved all seen, which as of now has been most.\n\n&apos;May Nights&apos;, based upon the short story (the third in the collection &quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&quot;) by Nikolai Gogol, is among Rou&apos;s best to me, one of his most accessible and entertaining. It brought back all those fond memories seeing all the Russian fantasies and animation viewed six years ago, and one of my absolute favourites of the &quot;re-visiting&quot; period. Like Rou&apos;s other work, &apos;May Nights&apos; entertains and charms with enough imaginative touches to give it a sense of wonder. There is a strangeness at times, being another one of his surreal fantasies, but not in a way that gets too overly weird or affects the coherence of the storytelling. It is very short, running just a little over an hour, some may consider that length too short. Not to me, with the original story&apos;s content lending itself ideally to not being feature length.\n\nIt is a well made film visually and has held up well. The scenery makes one pine for a trip to Russia and the settings are the very meaning of wondrous, enhanced further by photography that is never too flashy or overblown nor simplistic or static and beautiful use of colour. The effects are not overused or abused and do have a magical charm, don&apos;t think they&apos;ve dated at all. The music is atmospheric, whimsical and infectious, as well as appealing to listen to and not detracting at all from what&apos;s happening.\n\nAlso highly successful is the writing and storytelling. The writing never becomes over-complicated and the comedy is very funny and deftly timed. The story has a sense of wonder and has a lot of heart and charm, moving swiftly and never feeling tiresome. Some of it gets complicated but it never becomes incoherent. There is more of a surreal touch here than in the original story, with the mysterious forces including witches, rusalki and even Satan, but not in a way that&apos;s too bizarre or detracts.\n\nCharacters are always engaging and ones worth caring for and while the acting is slightly theatrical, especially from the suitably obstinate mayor, it still suits the characters and their personalities very well and there is a lot of spirit in the portrayals.\n\nOverall, one slice of May Night mayhem that made me happy. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "You know something is wrong with a Snow White movie, when the evil queen is looking better than Snow White herself.\n\nBasically this is movie that is a very loose adaption of the brothers Grimm story, about Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Loose adaptation perhaps isn&apos;t the best way to say it. It&apos;s more of a very own and very different interpretation of the classic fairy tale, that changes lots of things around but unfortunately not in a very good or interesting enough way.\n\nThis project definitely had some potential in it but it doesn&apos;t dare to take things far enough. It now instead comes across as a lame, half attempt, at re-imagining, the classic fairy tale. What could had been a very atmospheric and perhaps also darker take on the story, works out as a lame and odd one instead.\n\nI don&apos;t even really know how to take this movie in the first place. It&apos;s not adventurous enough for an adventure/fantasy movie, not funny or entertaining enough for a comedy and not serious enough for a drama. It seems that they were mostly going for a comical and entertaining approach but the humor is often so incredibly lame, simplistic and predictable, that this movie is only funny to watch for some young kids, who simply don&apos;t know any better yet. I don&apos;t know, perhaps this also was the crowd this movie was going for, since it certainly feels like a live action Disney movie at times but I just can&apos;t say for sure, since this movie is taking so many different different kinds of approaches at times, to its visual style and story. \n\nReally, I like Tarsem Singh&apos;s his style and visual approach to all of his movies but he often seems to have some problems with the storytelling and focus of the story. This movie often goes all over the place. The first half is pretty much focusing on the evil queen, played by Julia Roberts, while the second half suddenly is all about Snow White. There is not a good enough balance between each of those two characters, as if Julia Roberts demanded she would get first billing and the writers, in a frenzy, changed the script around, which certainly went at the expensive of everything and everyone else in this movie.\n\nThere are still a couple of interesting visual moments in this movie, as you could expect from a Singh movie. However, yet the movie still doesn&apos;t feel like a very imaginative one, or like it is taking place in a magical fairy tale world. Instead the movie feels and looks like it is taking place in a studio, all the time. Besides, it also really seems like Tarsem Singh was holding back this time with his visual style, which was also really another disappointment about this movie.\n\nNot a great movie at all!\n\n5/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dracula&apos;s Daughter&quot; is a trailblazer in many respects. It&apos;s the earliest film I can think of that features a truly sympathetic vampire protagonist. It&apos;s also the earliest mainstream film that I&apos;m aware of with such a strong lesbian subtext. (Actually, it&apos;s not even a &quot;sub&quot; text, it&apos;s plain as day!) As you might expect, these rather surprising elements make it a highly memorable viewing experience - perhaps even more memorable than its predecessor, Lugosi&apos;s &quot;Dracula,&quot; which is basically just a truncated version of Bram Stoker&apos;s novel.\n\nUnfortunately, &quot;Dracula&apos;s Daughter&quot; misses the mark of greatness that it probably deserves. The film is only about an hour and ten minutes long, so there isn&apos;t sufficient time to fully develop Countess Zaleska, the title character. And it&apos;s extremely frustrating that the first fifteen minutes or so are basically squandered on a lot of painfully unfunny business involving two comedy constables. The humor has aged really, really badly, unless you somehow find it convulsively hilarious when one of the constables reacts to every strange and dramatic happening around him by saying &quot;oooh...&quot; \n\nI tend to complain that modern-day horror features too much dumb comedy that hurts its credibility, but &quot;Dracula&apos;s Daughter&quot; is living proof that studios were injecting silly rubbish into otherwise good horror material as long as seventy years ago! \n\nThe serious parts of the film work well, however. Countess Zaleska and her faithful servant, Sandor, have some interesting exchanges about the loneliness of immortality and the darkness of the vampire&apos;s universe. The scene when Zaleska burns her father&apos;s body is also very moody and dramatic. (How does one get a job like Sandor&apos;s, anyway? Don&apos;t you think it would be fun to play personal servant to a glamorous female vampire? No? Maybe it&apos;s just me, then.) \n\nIf the film has another flaw, aside from the comedy, it&apos;s the human protagonist, Dr. Garth. Otto Kruger plays the character as stubborn and really rather abrupt. He&apos;ll spew a few lines of psycho-babble at the countess, then charge out of the room and leave his job with her half-done at best. A more attentive psychiatrist might perhaps have made for a more sympathetic and proactive hero. As it is, he&apos;s basically just an irritating presence who distracts us from the &quot;villains,&quot; who are infinitely more interesting and more worthy of our time.",

The message of romantic love being timeless and one that can cross many generations was very well appreciated and felt. The scenery of Italy in the film is gorgeous. There are breathtaking shots that make you want to hop on a plane after the film is over and go there yourself.\n\nIt was also truly refreshing to watch a film that I don&apos;t believe contained a single cuss word or sexual innuendo. (We need more of these movies). You could see this movie with your teens or your grandmother without the slightest bit of concern about being embarrassed of what might show up on the big screen. You walked out of the theatre feeling happy and remembering your own love story -- or hoping for your own love story to come.\n\nDon&apos;t miss this one if you get a chance to see it. You will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "I was given the chance to sit down and watch the 2010 Thai horror movie &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot;. But I have to admit that I wasn&apos;t much fan of the 2009 predecessor &quot;My Ex&quot;, so it was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot;. But still, since it was a Thai horror movie that I hadn&apos;t already seen, of course I found myself sitting down to watch it.\n\nAnd as it turned out, &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot; was just as less than mediocrely entertaining as the 2009 predecessor movie. So there wasn&apos;t much of any improvement to the 2010 movie.\n\nFor a Thai horror movie then &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot; felt rather mundane and tame. It wasn&apos;t really a scary movie, though director Piyapan Choopetch definitely was making use of a lot of jump-scares, to the point where it was beginning to just wear thin.\n\nThe storyline in &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot;, while it was rather straight forward, just didn&apos;t really impress me, much less provide proper entertainment. Sure, I managed to sit through the entire movie, but this was definitely not an outstanding or impressive foray into the Thai horror genre.\n\nThe acting in &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot; was adequate enough, though I didn&apos;t really find any of the performances to be overly memorable. I am sure that the actors and actresses were doing their best with the limitations of the script, character gallery and dialogue.\n\n&quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot; came and went without leaving much of a lasting impression. And I can honestly say that this is not a Thai horror movie that I would recommend you spending your time, money or effort on. There are far better choices readily available, if you enjoy Thai horror. My rating of &quot;My Ex 2: Haunted Lover&quot; lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1948, the borderline in Eastern Turkey is drawn right through a small village. Friends and lovers are separated, blind bureaucrats are taking over and everyone - even the bureaucrats - has too deal with this new age they are not yet ready for, in their naive way.\n\nI really loved this movie and in my humble opinion it is one of the best Turkish pictures ever. It depicts the warmth and passion of the Turkish temperament, although it is a sarcastic comment on stubborn bureaucracy, not only in Turkey but everywhere! The cast is great with the beloved Kemal Sunal (died much too early like all good people) and the wonderful Metin Akpinar. They both are comedians who are usually playing funny, often touching parts with a moral-lesson, like to learn what the really important things in life are.\n\nIt is indeed a realistic picture, because in the 1940&apos;s people who thought they were neighbors were separated this way. Everyone handles this situation in a very naive way; even the officers do not really know what a passport looks like, because everything is so new. As for the pregnant girl who is still accepted by her family although she is not married: I am sure even in those days there were people who were not so dumb and stubborn to put family honor above love for the family members. The father-character portrait by Akpinar is a simple but wise man, who is loyal to his beloved ones.\n\nOne last point: This is a modern movie about old Turkey, so you get a bit of both worlds. You find the positive stereotypes as well as the negative ones. Half the Turkish population are modern, western-oriented people, who are aware of their own culture, but also open to others. The fanatic-islamist people are stubborn and intolerant and as such a group you can find anywhere in the world, and they will always be there, as you see in this movie. We should end all prejudices for a better tomorrow! But with each passing day, this feat seems to be more out of reach than ever. What a shame!"

      "reviewBody": "Several times during the movie, I noticed what the screenwriter had intended but couldn&apos;t be realized by the director. Whether it was due to a lack of time, budget, passion, or capability, I cannot say. The film&apos;s biggest weakness, in my opinion, is the lack of emotional depth in the characters, and thus their credibility. Time and again, I tried to immerse myself in the film, only to be pulled out moments later by absurd plot holes and erratic narrative jumps without clear motives. The occasionally poor acting, combined with the predominantly regional actors with a strong local flair and at times incomprehensible dialects, added to this. The succession of one film homage after another, without building the characters and their relationships, felt more like a Hollywood action documentary than a feature film. The first half of the movie gets one star from me, the second half a commendable five stars, resulting in an overall score of three stars. A highlight for me was the actress playing the refugee girl, whose natural charisma overshadowed all other participants in front of the camera.",

Scott. These two great but very different actors play wonderfully off one another--Scott&apos;s earthy energy against the elegant tones and sorrowful eyes of O&apos;Toole--who is on his way to destroy the sin cities of Sodom and Gommorah with all their inhabitants.\n\nThe other fine portrayal is of Nimrod, &quot;a mighty hunter before the Lord&quot;, by the late actor Steven Boyd. In a single, four minutes scene he captures all the kingly hubris of this biblical figure-- the first in the book of Genesis who does not represent a nation. He who built the Tower of Babel, and saw it destroyed.\n\nChildren would be entertained by the carnival of the animals sequence depicting Noah and the Ark.",

Add liberal amounts of nondescript English actors, add an officious bureaucrat who looks like G.I. Joe (the one with the fuzzy hair and beard) and a cute young blonde who spends much of the movie in her underwear. Fold in lots and lots and lots of talking and top off with Bryant Halliday in some pretty cool monster makeup, and you have this movie.\n\nWas it any good? Well, it was OK, but a movie like this seems like it should have been much more interesting. David Cronenberg could have done this much better. Heck, Freddie Francis could have done this movie better....",

The mother thinks that he needs a father&apos;s hard way ;the father thinks that a boarding-school is the solution ; but children from wealthy families (&quot;incompreso&quot;, where the father , a consul,leaves his children to a governess, or Eugenio (&quot;Voltati Eugenio &quot;) whose bourgeois parents sent him to his grandparents&apos; care in the country suffer as much as Mario, a boy from the working class.\n\nA working class which is not shown in a flattering light: under the pretext of taking in the brat,they want to get the father&apos;s big house .And the pair of lovers are not better.\n\nOnly Righetto ,a simple man ,asks for nothing in return ; alone in a word of selfish adults (a subject Comencini would often treat),he shows the straight and narrow.And thanks to him ,the window on Luna Park is wide open and the amusement ride restores faith in humanity.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Adventures of Pluto Nash&quot; was made and shelved for two years....a clear sign that the studio knew they had a box office bomb on their hands. The picture ended up costing $100,000,000 to make and earned back only a little over $11,000,000 worldwide! Because of this, it&apos;s the biggest financial disaster in film history. However, after seeing it I realized that is not that bad...even if it is on IMDB&apos;s infamous Bottom 100 List...and has a horrid overall score of 3,8!!\n\nAll this being said, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s really that bad a film. I think the problem, more than anything else, was that according to some sources, the star, Eddie Murphy, really burned a lot of bridges while making this film...insisting on re-writes and overruling the director repeatedly. And, it seems that the studio got sick of him and the controversy...and word of this leaked out and killed the movie. And, so, as often happens with movies like &quot;Gigli&quot;, people just start getting on the bandwagon...and heap tons of hate on the picture. However, after seeing it, I thought the movie was actually not bad. Would I pay to go see it? No. Would I pay to rent it? No. But if it was available to see for free on TV, then it&apos;s worth seeing.\n\nSo apart from its horrible reputation, there is one big problme with the film....it&apos;s not a comedy. Now perhaps it was intended as one....but there isn&apos;t a laugh in the story and it&apos;s more an unusual action/adventure film....and I can enjoy it on that level. It also doesn&apos;t help that it&apos;s very obvious that the film was written and re-written and edited and re-edited...with entire story lines dropped and inexplicably so!\n\nThe story is set in the future ...a future when the moon is colonized and is a nice place to live...unless you are Pluto. This is because some mobsters want to take his successful nightclub...and they offer him a fraction of what it&apos;s worth. He rejects their offer...and they almost immediately blow the place up and try to kill him. Most of the film consists of Pluto and his companions (Rosario Dawson and Randy Quaid...who plays a robot) on the run until the final boss battle.\n\nSo what did I like about it? Well, the film looks nice for 2002 with decent special effects, costumes and CGI. Compared to today&apos;s CGI it&apos;s kinda shabby...but that is to be expected after 17 years...technology simply improves and improves over time. Also, the story isn&apos;t terrible and the acting is generally decent.\n\nSo, on whole, the story just isn&apos;t funny, parts are obviously missing due to hack editing and re-writes but it looks good and isn&apos;t annoying or hellish....like a Bottom 100 film should be. Watchable.\n\nBy the way, a couple final comments. First, I saw a review which said that they &apos;laughed from start to finish&apos;. I can only assume this person laughs at ANYTHING....funerals, dramas, Coke commercials, etc....as the film simply isn&apos;t funny and doesn&apos;t look at all like a comedy. Second, it&apos;s become in fashion to hate Eddie Murphy in recent years. While he has had some serious box office stinkers, he&apos;s STILL amazingly talented. See &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; or &quot;Bowfinger&quot; and you&apos;ll know what I mean. But I also think he&apos;d benefit from realizing that he alone cannot make a great film...it takes teamwork and a good script.",

The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways, bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words, the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren,(Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However, the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it, if you decided to View IT !",

      "reviewBody": "The title comes from Samson&apos;s famous last prayer asking God to give him the strength one last time to take revenge. In a surprising exercise of symmetry, Avi Mograbi uses Jewish mythology to portray the Palestinian mindset. Against a backdrop of senseless daily persecution, Mograbi shows us lost people, clueless in a situation that nobody seems to make any sense out of. It is a fresh new approach void of the usual bloody violence and hatred, with no commentary or voice-over, where real-life people enact a macabre and surrealist play. It is this kind of documentaries that give me hope because I can see that there are still people in the midst of all this hatred that can still retain enough lucidity to recognize what they see for what it is : a shame. Two peoples with so much in common entangled in a death embrace that will consume them both. Just like the director of the documentary, we want to scream at them &quot; What are you doing ?!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Yes T-Force is a low-budget B-movie that went strong to video &amp; TV back in the early 90&apos;s but it&apos;s way better than it probably should be.\n\nMade by PM Entertainment, that Awesome cheap movie production place of the 90&apos;s, that created lots of truly awesome action-packed thriller&apos;s such as Zero Tolerance, Dark Breed &amp; many, many more. Often their films were a mix of sci-fi action &amp; thriller genres with lots of shooting, explosions &amp; brutal killings &amp; the excellent T-Force is no different. I&apos;m a fan of PM Entertainment &amp; their kick-ass output.\n\nT-Force is a slice of action-packed Sci-fi with a mix of the buddy-cop genre &amp; stars the cool Jack Scalia, he also made the Awesome Dark Breed &amp; The Silencers for PM Entertainment, who plays a hard-ass Detective in a futuristic Los Angeles &amp; isn&apos;t happy about all the Robots that live amongst humans. Jack Scalia has those looks of a chiselled 90&apos;s heartthrob but with a tough exterior &amp; a sarcastic attitude, basically a perfect leading man for the video store era B-movie genre.\n\nI felt vibes of Will Smith&apos;s Detective character Del Spooner from i,Robot (2004) here &amp; T-Force came out well before so i,Robot definitely copied some stuff from this flick.\n\nJack Scalia is a decent actor that was a big TV star during the 80&apos;s &amp; 90&apos;s &amp; starred in many B-movies &amp; i like him as he really looks like a hard-ass government agent or something lol. Scalia is great in Dark Breed &amp; The Silencers, both kick-ass ultra cool sci-fi action thriller&apos;s directed by the same director of T-Force, Richard Pepin.\n\nScalia is a tough no-nonsense cop named Jack Floyd (i really liked his hardened character) who has to deal with a new Robot partner (fun buddy-cop stuff here) to track down &amp; stop a team of super Robots called the T-Force (short for Terminal Force) that have gone rogue (Blade Runner style) &amp; are on a killing spree against, what they believe to be a corrupted government. The Robots &amp; wanting to be human stuff is done really well &amp; the robot team of super soldiers that are called into handle terrorist situations are all well played by very well by the actors. Everyone took it serious in a way, there&apos;s a dodgy cheesy sex experimental scene between two Robots that is corny &amp; there just for the steamy 90&apos;s Erotic stuff that 90&apos;s cheap movies did. This is actually a smart little film with that actually makes you think about what is the part that makes us...well us, is it the soul? Or our consciousness! This film asks questions &amp; from the Robots side. Even the reason this crack team of Robot soldiers turn on their creators is done well. The T-Force are to be destroyed after a hostage situation goes wrong &amp; some innocent people are killed but the Robots decide to fight back under &quot;Self Preservation&quot; that is one of their rights. These human looking Robots do not want to Die, just like a human wouldn&apos;t want to Die &amp; would fight back. The Robots trying to understand humanity is done incredibly smartly &amp; made me think. The material may be that of action &amp; explosions but there&apos;s definitely something more heartfelt underneath it all. A damn good script is &amp; top notch directing made T-Force a cult classic in my opinion. Great character actor Vernon Wells (Mad Max 2, Innerspace, Commando) has a little role as a terrorist at the Awesome explosive beginning action sequence.\n\nI really liked the good robot soldier called Cain played by Bobby Johnston, he did a great likeable job &amp; worked well with Scalia in an Alien Nation way.\n\nThere&apos;s lots of awesome 90&apos;s action sequences &amp; a feel of Albert Pyun&apos;s Nemesis with a touch of Robocop &amp; Universal Soldier &amp; of course both Terminator films but T-Force deserves it&apos;s place up there with those as a cult classic piece of action sci-fi Entertainment.\n\nI liked the music score &amp; loved how the film looked, the cinematography is typically cool of PM entertainment with everything bathed in cool blue lighting with lots of smoke around &amp; the combination works perfectly.\n\nT-Force is a top action thriller with an awesome sci-fi sheen &amp; a top hard-ass performance from Jack Scalia.",

      "reviewBody": "The trailer and opening voice-over (which I suspect was tacked-on by Troma after the film&apos;s completion) of &quot;A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell&quot; try to sell this film as a campy comedy, but it&apos;s actually a rather serious futuristic / prehistoric adventure. The story and dialogue are minimal; the film is slow and often boring, but the stop-motion animation effects for the various monsters, although dated, still have a nostalgic charm (I&apos;d take them over the clumsy CGI of contemporary B-movies any day of the week), and Linda Corwin is very sexy as the not-so-nymphoid barbarian - she has the lean, muscular physique of a track athlete (perhaps she was one), and she can fight too: in the movie&apos;s best scene, she chokes a mutant to death. Shortly after that, there is a fight between a deformed &quot;good guy&quot; and the main villain which is surprisingly long and exhausting. My total grade for this film is 4 stars + 2 extra stars for Linda Corwin = 6 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The genre known as &apos;Genius&apos; film, depicting the lives of those who have made an indelible mark on history, is eminently suited to the achievements of medical scientists whose brilliance, dedication and determination have triumphed over adversity to the betterment of mankind.\n\nDirected by Hans Steinhoff, this splendid biopic of Dr. Robert Koch, renowned as the founder of Bacteriology, is said to be Germany&apos;s answer to Hollywood&apos;s &apos;Louis Pasteur&apos;, the director of which, William Dieterle, also made &apos;Dr. Erlich&apos;s Magic Bullet&apos; starring the inimitable Edward G. Robinson and featuring a brief appearance by Albert Basserman as Dr. Koch.\n\nThe effectiveness of films of this type lies in the obstacles these pioneers have to overcome in pursuit of their life-changing discoveries and here the Koch of Emil Jannings is up against the powerful Berliner scientist, Reichstag deputy and Privy councillor Rudolf Virchow played by Werner Krauss. When, in March 1884 Koch announces to the Physiological Society Conference his discovery that Tuberculosis is an infectious disease and not hereditary, the previously sceptical Virchow finally acknowledges Koch&apos;s achievement and the final duologue between these two magnificent but since &apos;demonised&apos; actors is a real treat.\n\nCinematography is by Fritz Arno Wagner, famous for his classic collaborations with Pabst and Murnau and who decided to remain in Germany during the war.\n\nBilly Wilder referred to Hans Steinhoff as &apos;a talentless idiot&apos; but this viewer has not yet seen a film of his that he has not enjoyed.\n\nHe also directed Jannings in the excellent &apos;Der Alte und der Junge Koenig&apos; whilst the inflammatory nature of their last collaboration &apos;Ohm Krueger&apos; proved to be the final nail in Janning&apos;s career. Although Krauss continued working after the required period of denazification, he never shook off the stigma of collaboration and died in obscurity. As for Steinhoff, he was aboard a plane leaving Berlin which was shot down by the Russians.\n\nWhen watching films made during the Third Reich it is of course essential to have one&apos;s moral compass handy and this certainly applies to those of Herr Steinhoff! It must be said however that Dr. Koch&apos;s story is one that needed to be told and it has been done so here in tasteful and exemplary fashion.",

Family secrets and tense relations will surface and the dying old man, secretive as can be, will nonetheless give clues to what is really going on in the city without limits.\n\nThis Spanish and Argentinian co-production is a testament to the collaboration of nations to produce top-notch film-making with an excellent cast, great directing, deep and compelling storytelling, and the power of a incredible cinematic experience.\n\nThere are so many interesting stories intertwined that some will be left without clear answers, and this is particularly effective because of the care taken to flesh out believable flawed characters that make us attached and concerned about their lives.  Lives that are no less complicated and problematic than our own.\n\nYou will experience unexpected turns hand and hand with the characters and be able to not only relish the story and the denouement of the complex plot, but to appreciate this portray of the drives and constraints of men.",

      "reviewBody": "Gulati&apos;s &apos;Prince&apos; is pretty much another one of those horrible presents that are covered in beautiful giftwrap. It starts off with the title character stealing a coin (yes, of all things he steals a coin which is, as you&apos;ll see later, worth millions or whatever). Anyway, then he finds himself awake in his condo with no recollection of anything. Yup, he don&apos;t even remember his own name. A servant feeds his memory but that ain&apos;t enough. He goes to a nightclub and sees a hot slut performing an item number. She claims to be his girlfriend Maya. The morning after, he receives a phonecall from a seductress (Nandana Sen with overdone makeup), who also claims to be his girlfriend Maya. After some doubts and encounters, Prince is sure that seductress number two is the real Maya until it turns out that she&apos;s a &apos;chamchi&apos; of a pathetic crackwhore kingpin and the truth is revealed that kingpin and chamchi orchestrated this in order to obtain the coin from Prince. Prince is then rescued by seductress number 3 (played by a newcomer whose name I don&apos;t know but she looks hot and cannot act). Now this number 3 also claims to be Maya. Who is the real Maya? Why does everyone want the coin? What&apos;s happened to Prince&apos;s memory. \n\nMy proper answer would be: Who cares? But if you still want to waste precious time then just watch this horrendous movie which has very good special effects. The slow motions are quite retarded (as they almost always look in Bollywood movies). If the intention was to make a slick action movie why use slow motion at all? I really think Bollywood movies should avoid using slow motion. The camera-work is impressive and the songs are forgettable (some are downright horrible).\n\nVivek Oberoi is adequate. His performance mainly suffers from bad writing. I can only imagine he did this film because he badly needed a hit and hopefully he got that so that now he can focus on doing meaningful cinema. The rest of the actors are downright bad. Nandana Sen is unintentionally funny.\n\n&apos;Prince&apos; is all gloss and no substance. Enough said."

      "reviewBody": "Entertaining , moving and violent film set in Mexican Revolution in which a pair of two-fisted characters confront enemies in diverse sides . During the Mexican Rebellion of 1866 , an unsavory group of American adventurers are hired by the forces of Emperor Maximilian to escort a countess to Vera Cruz . Napoleon III, emperor of France , creates in Mexico a vassal state governed by Maximilian (George Mcready) of France . The French troops control the country and the fate of its inhabitants . There soon emerges a rebel leader , Benito Juarez, whose supporters took the name of &quot;juaristas&quot; . Two soldiers of fortune find themselves in different camps , as &quot;Benjamin Trane&quot; (Gary Cooper was 52 at the time of filming, although his character was only supposed to be a couple of years older than Burt&apos;s role) is the good guy and &quot;Joe Erin&quot; (Burt Lancaster) is the bad guy , both of whom along with their motley group (Ernest Borgnine , Jack Lambert , Jack Elam , Charles Bronson) decide serve the Emperor Maximilian . Meanwhile , Benjamin Trane falls in love for a beautiful Mexican rebel (Spanish Sara Montiel) . During a party celebrated by Marquis Henri de Labordere (Cesar Romero) they meet the Countess &quot;Marie Duvarre&quot; (Denise Darcel) , both gunmen must protect her from possible attacks of the revolutionaries . In fact , they are planning seize a stagecoach filled with valuable gold . The picture was partially based on historical events , as Maximilian was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico on 10 April 1864, with the backing of Napoleon III of France and a group of Mexican monarchists who sought to revive the Mexican monarchy. Many foreign governments, including that of the United States, refused to recognize his administration. This helped to ensure the success of republican forces led by Benito Juárez, and Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.\n\nInteresting as well as action-packed Western full of thrills, emotion , intrigue , shootouts and marvelous outdoors from Mexico . The two giants , Cooper and Lancaster , battle in the biggest spectacle of them all . Anthological performance by Burt Lancaster is fabulous , his character would influence profoundly in Spaghetti Western ; he steals every scene as the black-dressed , smiling gunfighter . As the roles are more cynical , selfish and unscrupulous than traditional western . In fact , this film is sometimes called the &quot;first spaghetti western,&quot; due to its reputed influence on the Italian directors such as Sergio Leone who popularized the genre . The screenplay by Roland Kibbee and James R. Webb is pretty basic but holds your interest until the exciting climatic Shotdown . Rousing as well as emotive musical score by the classical Hugo Friedhofer . Gorgeous cinematography by Ernest Laszlo , being the first film to be made in the SuperScope process. Luxurious sets and spectacular production design and one of the first major Hollywood films to be made on location in Mexico . Film-making legislation in Mexico meant that a local director had to be involved in the production in some capacity, though he wasn&apos;t actually used ; however , the Mexican authorities were appalled at the way their citizens were depicted in the film so any subsequent Hollywood productions had to conform to some strict rules . \n\nThe motion picture was compellingly directed by Robert Aldrich and produced by Burt Lancaster&apos;s own production company for $1.7 million, it went on to become a sizeable hit, grossing over $11 million. It was Robert Aldrich&apos;s personal favourite , he particularly enjoyed the fact that it had a hero and an anti-hero. Aldrich directed a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone and violent scenes . He was an expert on warlike (Dirty Dozen , The Angry Hills , Attack , Ten seconds to hell) and Western (The Frisko kid , Ulzana&apos;s raid, Apache , Veracruz , The last sunset) . Raing : Above average , it&apos;s a must see and a standout in its genre .",

      "reviewBody": "Not to make this all about me, but sometimes, when you&apos;re rummaging through the `box o&apos;fun&apos; sent to you by the Film Threat staff, you&apos;re never sure what you&apos;re going to get. `Necropolis Awakened&apos; is a perfect example of this. I chose it because it had the word `Necropolis&apos; in the title. Soon after I watched it, I found that everyone else in the world seems to have already discovered this indie zombie gem, leaving me completely out of the loop. Message boards I visited on a regular basis had info galore and praise singing out for this movie. So where the hell was I all this time? All of a sudden, the damn thing is everywhere!\n\n`Necropolis Awakened&apos; is a $10,000 uber-feature shot on DV and spawned from the wilds of Oregon, produced by a trio of brothers. The script and high-octane direction are courtesy of Garrett White, with all other duties relegated to Brandon and (yes, I&apos;m serious) Duke. These three guys pretty much encompass the entire movie, with the latter Whites each tackling a pair of roles and doing the quadruple production duty at the same time.\n\n Since this is a low-budget horror movie, it of course involves zombies. Virtually all debut feature horror films are zombie movies, and that&apos;s one of the reasons America is so great. Everyone with a camcorder can go out and make a reasonably watchable zombie movie, and there are numerous ways to play with the &apos;zombies-take-over&apos; scenario. And the Whites certainly have come up with a story that is both unique and cliché at the same time. I say &apos;cliché&apos;, but not in a bad way - you&apos;re still dealing with flesh-eating zombies, after-all, and you&apos;re pretty limited by the monsters&apos; very natures. At least zombies come with their own shorthand for the audience, so there isn&apos;t too much to understand about how they work.\n\nThe small town of Skyhook has been chosen as the new site for the biochemical company Neo-Genentrix, which annoys most of the townsfolk, including their resident alcoholic war-hero, Bob, particularly when he realizes that the town is now filled with the lumbering, rotting undead. When he starts making trouble for the company, particularly their CEO - a surprisingly nasty-looking Clive Barker-esque persona named (yes, I&apos;m serious) Nefarious Thorne - Neo-Genetrix hires a trio of assassins to take Bob out. Um, yeah, I&apos;m not sure why zombies need human hitmen to take out one lone human either, particularly when there are different classes of zombies - including `Proletariat&apos; - capable of speech and increased movement. But after a while, I stopped asking questions.\n\n The movie starts with a high-speed car chase, which is pretty darned impressive in and of itself, and the Whites must have thought so too, as it goes on for about ten minutes. Which is the biggest problem with the movie. Plot holes and hit-or-miss acting aside, the moviemakers&apos; most grievous miscalculation is that it&apos;s just too long. There are a great number of very impressive set pieces, the car chase just one of the outstanding examples of camera-work, suspense, and high-energy filmmaking. But every single sequence could have been trimmed to flow much better. You can&apos;t fault these guys for the coverage, and it&apos;s strange to even complain about `too much&apos; action, but it does tend to drag things down, as oxymoronic as that may seem.\n\n It would be easy, again, to pick on the script and the acting, but that comes with the indie territory. Garrett&apos;s strengths are obviously in directing, composing and staging of action. And the Oregon scenery is used to a great effect. But he&apos;d be well advised to work with, at least, a co-screenwriter in the future, someone who can tighten dialogue and limit his use of flashbacks - I was getting lost left and right in the story in terms of past or present. The strangest phenomenon to occur in `Necropolis Awakened&apos; deals with Mr. Duke White, who proves to be both the best and worst actor in the movie. As `Bob&apos;, he&apos;s terrific and comes off tough and heroic; as the villainous `Judas&apos;, he&apos;s over-the-top and snarling, his face contorted like he&apos;s trying to pass a tractor.\n\nOverall, the brothers do well with their limited budget, and manage to squeeze a lot of value out of their $10,000. It will most likely end up with a cadre of cultish fans, but it was sort-of designed to be a cult movie anyway. Faults aside, it&apos;s pretty impressive as a whole. If you&apos;re a fan of zombie movies, you&apos;ll find yourself a new favorite movie here.",

      "reviewBody": "Aldo Lado gives us a much lighter film that Night Train Murders this time around, with a tale of a bromance...a criminal bromance, with motorcycle racing.\n\nSandro (Massimo Rieneri from Death Rage) is a humble pastry chef who also moonlights as a waiter. He&apos;s bored working for the man and wouldn&apos;t mind a big break, and things start looking up once young, hunky Pericles (Dallesandro) robs a dinner party he&apos;s working at. This leads him to get paid off, but he does meet up with Joe again, and after being charmed by Joe&apos;s confidence and ambition, lets him stay at his apartment.\n\nLooks like a bromance is blossoming, although the way Joe walks about the place in the nude made me think Joe was wanting to take things a little further. Joe&apos;s excuse for the nudity was that he was having some sort of severe headache due to a prior motorcycle race injury, and that he just need fresh air. I didn&apos;t think Sandro looked that convinced.\n\nJoe teaches Sandro how to bag snatch and grift and before you know it the two of them have stolen a bag from Marzia, who doesn&apos;t have much money but does own a red-hot diary that makes Sandro track her down for a date on the pretence that he found her purse. As you can see, so far, things aren&apos;t that grim in this film. Mostly.\n\nSome kind of a plot arrives in the form of Joe&apos;s casual lover Marisa Mell (He even uses motorcycle dialogue while in the sack!). Marisa needs some money shifted out of the country and when Joe finds out how that&apos;s to be done, he comes up with a plan for one last heist. He also discovers there&apos;s a motorcycle race on, so he comes up with a plan for one last motorcycle race...\n\nGiven the lightweight material of the plot, Aldo Lado still manages to keep you interested in what&apos;s going on because of the chemistry between Joe and Sandro, and, let&apos;s face it, the immense amount of homo-eroticism between the two. Even when Marzia gets involved with Sandro, she wants Joe to join in! As this is a crime flick and not a comedy, there is an increasing amount of violence leading up to the end of the film, plus motorcycle racing if that&apos;s your thing.",

They are 13year-old teenagers in first place!&quot; With this in mind they tell a fascinating story about first love, taking part in a music contest and deep friendship. On the way through this movie you will get to know a lot about living in a German boarding school for the blind and the daily life of blind teenagers, but you will never feel like the director raises his forefinger and wants to teach you a lesson about &quot;blindness&quot;.\n\nWhen doing a movie with handicapped people many directors tell you in interviews all the time, that they &quot;wanted to show, that these people are just normal as you and I&quot;. Bernd Sahling does not need to stress this, because he made a normal movie for children - and it is a good one - in the first place with the only little difference, that his leading actors are blind - so what?!?\n\n9 out of 10",

      "name": "A notable Paella Western  with a  Spaghetti  great star , Peter Lee Lawrence , and being compellingly directed by Julio Buchs",
      "reviewBody": "This above-average Tortilla Western packs thrills , action , brawls , crossfire and drags at times , balancing in ups and downs ; though resulting to be pretty entertaining . This interesting as well revisionist Chorizo Western titled &quot;I&apos;ll Kill Him and Return Alone&quot; (USA title) is partially based on real events , it blends true events along with fictitious , the plot is developed on the following way : At the beginning Billy (Peter Lee Lawrence) lives happily with his widow mother (Gloria Milland) . Then Billy&apos;s mother is raped by Tom McGregor (Antonio Molino Rojo) and the young gunfighter kills to him . Billy is pursued by Peter McGregor (Miguel Palenzuela) and hoodlums (Luis Barboo) and takes place a gundown . Billy flees and he early becomes a cowboy in Lincoln County, New Mexico , for cattleman Tunstall (Luis Prendes). But in 1878 Tunstall was killed by a rival cattle outfit (Antonio Pica , Alfonso De La Vega, Jose Canalejas) led by Murphy (Carlos Casaravilla) and this began the Lincoln County War, in which Billy played a leading part and was one of the group that shot dead Sheriff Brady . Billy seeks revenge for his death and he converted an outlaw and nasty gunfighter with a price on his head . Bonney and his gang pull off a hot pursuit against the enemies . At that time the Lincoln County War was in progress ,a range war between rival cattle interests, the Kid was a leading gunman for one faction but Pat Garrett , a former friend of Billy , stayed out of the fighting . When Billy became a rustler, the big ranch owners, especially John Chisum , wanted him out of the way and the man they chose to do the job was Pat Garrett . Billy, his band (Enrique Avila, Luis Rivera , among others) were besieged but he went out firing his gun and made his escape . Then Pat Garrett (Fausto Tozzi) was elected sheriff of Lincoln County and set out to capture the young outlaw . The Kid was caught and convicted of killing but he managed to escape . Garrett went after him again and on 15 July 1881 tracked him to the home of Pete Maxwell at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, where Billy was along with his band and there Billy was dead by surprise . Legend says that Billy killed twenty-one men in his twenty-one years of life, the exact figure is not known but is thought to be much less .\n\nThis is an intense and moving Western about a known gunslinger, the most famous outlaw-gunfighter of the South-west . However , some moments is slow moving and contains a few flaws and gaps. This is a revisionist look about the known story of the West&apos;s greatest bandit. Contemporary-style Spaghetti Western with nice performances and fine direction by Julio Buchs who creates some good action scenes and exciting set pieces . The notorious Spaghetti actor , Peter Lee Lawrence is good in his usual tough role , here playing the known and very young bandit . The Kid is well performed , he plays as an avenger , violent young and favourite with girls , this time with Dyanik Zurakowska as Helen . Blond German youth Peter Lee Lawrence, who made his uncredited debut in Sergio Leone &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot; (1965), was the hero in many Spaghetti Westerns. His short cinematographic history can be enclosed in nine years of Italo-Spain co-productions such as &quot;More Dollars for the MacGregors&quot; , ¨Winchester justice¨,&quot;Pistol for a Hundred Coffins&quot;, ¨The man who killed Billy the Kid¨ , ¨Fury of Johnny Kid¨ and several others . Furthermore , a largely secondary cast plenty with Spanish secondaries , all of them ordinary in Chorizo western as Antonio Pica , Jose Canalejas , Alfonso Rojas , Alvaro De Luna , Simon Arriaga , Luis Barboo , Rafael Hernandez , Francisco Sanz , Milo Quesada , Frank Braña , Enrique Avila , Luis Induni , Luis Prendes and many others . Adequate photography by Miguel Fernandez Mila , being necessary a right remastering because of the film copy is washed out , filmed on location in Las Rozas , Manzanares Del Real , La Pedriza , , and of course , Almeria . The movie was produced in enough budget by Ricardo Sanz and being accompanied by a rousing musical score by Gianni Ferrio , including enjoyable songs . \n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Julio Buchs . Julio Buchs was an expert on thriller as he proved in ¨Salario De Crimen¨, ¨Alta tension¨ and ¨Trumpets of Apocalypse¨ and Spaghetti such as ¨Los Desesperados¨ or ¨A bullet for Sandoval¨ , ¨I&apos;ll kill him and return alone¨ also titled ¨El Hombre Mató Billy Kid¨ and ¨Mestizo¨ or ¨Django does not forgive¨ . ¨El Hombre Mato a Billy Kid¨ along with ¨A bullet for Sandoval¨ , are considered two of the best Spaghettis ; the Buchs&apos;s best film was ¨Encrucijada Una Monja¨ with Rosanna Schiaffino playing a similar character to ¨Audrey Hepburn&apos;s The nun&apos;s story¨ ; all of them were well directed by Julio until his early death at 46 years old .",

Like the original trailer says, &quot;five stories in one&quot;, the film is about five main characters, whose life are somehow related to each other. Jackie Chan does a different role in this movie. Role is similiar to Heart of the Dragons. There are only few fight&apos;s, but it didnt bother me. I didnt watch this as a Chan movie.\n\nMovie is touching especially the ending. Surprising is the violence level in this movie. Endings big shootout and some other brutal violence too. The way jail-staff(movie happens in jail)treats the main character&apos;s made me wanting them to die. Guards are real a***oles.\n\nMovie success as a drama too. Samo Hung&apos;s character is most touching. He desperately escapes from jail to meet his son and pays for it, with pain. Ending is surprising and shocking. This movie is very very good. I can recommend this movie to every one who likes HK movies. Great actors. Great plot. Great emotions. I loved it."

Even so, it&apos;s still a pretty lousy movie.\n\nAn emotionally unstable acting student takes her pain-in-the-rear acting teacher on a spur-the-moment &quot;I&apos;m going to get rich playing blackjack!&quot; adventure and gets picked up by a casino coaching Kevin Costner. The whole acting thing never gets brought up again, by the way. Without enough knowledge about the card game, it&apos;s hardly a gambling movie. And with the classic &quot;I got a makeover but I&apos;m still not really that pretty&quot; scene, it&apos;s hardly a romance. Oh, and don&apos;t forget about the &quot;let&apos;s laugh and throw snowballs at each other&quot; scene, and the &quot;let&apos;s dance like goofy kids in an 80s country dive bar&quot; scene.\n\nPretty much the only redeeming part of the film is getting to see Kevin Costner in a cowboy hat, smirking and saying, &quot;Hot diggity!&quot; That&apos;s it. Save yourself 90 minutes and just imagine it.",

I didn´t regret watching it.\n\nSome scenes offered topics of conversation that were awkward, strange or uncomfortable. And no, I didn´t understand every decision that the characters took.

And there are very few over the age of consent who haven&apos;t had to at one time or another. This isn&apos;t the laugh out loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle, nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love and yet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out for them -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they are both basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, but good people. This is a movie that doesn&apos;t just make it you laugh, it makes you think. A rare find indeed.",

Brandman also directs this stylish charmer and has at his disposal actors not usually associated with a more serious type of story.\n\nJames (Macaulay Culkin) and Heather (Alexis Dziena) are young, attractive and in love, though Heather is finally able to confide in James that she is unable to achieve orgasm in their otherwise satisfactory sex life. Ellis (Kuno Becker) and Renee (Eliza Dushku) are another couple whose intimate life has lost its sparkle. Each of the couples (who have never met) hears about sex therapist Dr. Wellbridge (Joanna Miles) who supports the concept of group sex as a means to strengthen relationships grown stale. Each couple meets with the doctor, reveals their insecurities and fears and Dr. Wellbridge arranges a &apos;session&apos; for the two couples to share an evening of intimate interaction. How this &apos;change&apos; alters each couple&apos;s relationship is the message of the film: some surprises are in store that are unsuspected.\n\nYes, there is comedy here and yes, there is thoughtful dialog, but the pleasure of the film lies in discovering the expanded acting abilities demonstrated by these four young attractive actors. The film may not be deep, but it does entertain and it most certainly has some useful information about love and relationships we all need to know. Grady Harp",

Walter is an escapist and daydreams into a world of fantasy many times along the day. When Walter is commuting, he stumbles in the train with the gorgeous Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo) that uses Walter to escape from her pursuer. Walter unintentionally gets involved with a dangerous ring of spies that are seeking a black book with notes about a hidden treasure.\n\n&quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947) is a hilarious comedy about a clumsy daydreamer that gets into a dangerous ring of spies. Last Saturday I watched the annoying &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (2013) with Ben Stiller and I decided to seek the original 1947 movie that is better and better, with many gags. Danny Kaye is very funny performing the clumsy and coward Walter Mitty. Forget the 2013 remake and prefer to see the original 1947 comedy. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

It also includes interwiev´s with some band members and common people with attitude. Anarcy is the main word! The title of the movie isn´t right thought, because it should have been called Punk in Reykjavik, because the bands performing in the documentary are actually all punk bands. Punk hit Iceland like an atombomb in the eightees, actually four years later than the wave struck other Vest-Euorpean contries. The film is a must see for all punk fans and fans of Bjork, because it´s really weird to see her as a little girl performing in a punk band.",

It&apos;s a really fun movie with great acting from the South Korean actors and not to mention, there&apos;s a mixture of Korean and English (which is bilingual). The skiing scenes are well done and fast paced. The cinematography is really good. I think the reason why some scenes had some fog is probably due to the visual effects.\n\nIt&apos;s not a perfect movie, but it does have a few flaws in it. If you&apos;re a fan of skiing or Korean movies in general, then I think you&apos;ll really have a huge blast watching this movie. I think Showbox did a great job making Take Off, and I&apos;m definitely giving it a very strong 8/10.",

You can walk in at any moment on this movie and it doesn&apos;t matter, you don&apos;t have to follow it to enjoy it.

No other movie portraying the pogroms that initiated the holocaust come close to the depth and cinematic verite that Shop on Main Street depicts. I first saw this movie in the 1960&apos;s and it has remained in my psyche ever since in a haunting unnerving memory. Every subsequent viewing I gave it reinforced it&apos;s depth and artistic strength. The directing is on a par with Ingmar Bergman, but more direct and devoid of artistic devices. The cinematography is breathtaking (Black and White). Note the scene when the protagonist&apos;s confusion is exaggerated by the camera circling around and around, enveloping the viewer in his emotional madness and guilt. This is a must see for anyone seriously interested in the very best movies of all time."

I had never heard about it before I stumbled upon it. And I must admit that the movie&apos;s synopsis did sound interesting enough. And of course, with it being a horror movie that I hadn&apos;t already seen, of course I sat down to watch it.\n\nWell, I am not really quite sure what writers Sandra Martin and Hugues Martin wanted to accomplish with the plot and storyline that the concocted for &quot;Djinns&quot;. But it certainly wasn&apos;t a particularly outstanding memorable moment in horror cinema. In fact, the movie fell short of providing much of any entertainment or enjoyment to me.\n\nThe storyline was just simply too mundane and slow paced. And with nothing much of any worth of interest happening throughout the movie, it was just somewhat of a struggle to sit through the movie as it moved ahead with snail pace and offering little or no excitement or entertainment at all.\n\nAnd when things eventually do start to happen, and you get to the see the creatures that are stalking the French soldiers, you just simply shrug and go &quot;huh, okay&quot;. Yeah, it was rather anti-climatic and not really the great thing that the writers were trying to set it up to be.\n\nThe acting in the movie was adequate, even though the actors didn&apos;t really have much of anything solid or profound to work with in terms of script, dialogue or characters.\n\n&quot;Djinns&quot; was a swing and a miss, and I must admit that I had expected quite a different movie than what directors Hugues Martin and Sandra Martin delivered.\n\nMy rating of the 2010 movie &quot;Djinns&quot; lands on a generous two out of ten stars.",

It&apos;s Kitano. It&apos;s Kitano showing us what he feels we know of him in his films. Explosive, comical, distant, a little off the hook.

The division seems  mostly geographical though: most Americans can&apos;t seem to understand the tongue-in- cheekness of this movie.\n\n Probably it has to do with the fake-documentary nature of the movie, which is clearly  western-european. Anyone who has ever seen American documentaries knows they have  a different pace and way of treating images. Those who are used to belgian/french/ dutch/german documentaries will recognise the style of the so-called &quot;intimate&quot;  documentaries.\n\n The pivotal point is the moment a relationship develops &quot;beyond&quot; the documentary  relationship of the filmmakers and their subject (they take Ben&apos;s money to finish the  movie).\n\n When watching this movie, try to imagine that this *could* be a real movie:\n\n documentaries about  terrorists, drugdealers, and even mercenaries (the closest thing to an actual serial killer)  have been made, and some of them were very close to their subject.\n\nIt is *not* a &quot;black comedy&quot; in the classical sense of the word; more like a &quot;Clockwork  Orange&quot; for the nineties. Where &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; bathed in the design of the  seventies, this movie bathes in  the &quot;larger-than-life&quot; invasiveness of modern-day reality-tv-style television. Anyone  who has seen shows like &quot;cops&quot; or &quot;Big Brother&quot; will know what I&apos;m talking about. It asks the big documentary question: in how far does the observed change the observer? It makes a statement, not about violence, but about the observer of violence. The way it is portrayed shows the art of the (very low-budget) crew: it grips your guts  without fancy effects or gory protrayal of gore: it shows fear, despair and psychological  emptyness, by showing emotions! This should be recommended viewing (and debating)  to anyone making documentary films."

Jay Cox, the writer of the hit comedy &apos;Sweet Home Alabama&apos;, comes a heartwarming and tender gay romantic drama that combines laughs, seduction, tears, and plenty of romance. The handsome Aaron (Steve Sandvoss), a Mormon missionary, travels door-to-door in Los Angeles spreading the word of his religion. Christian (Wes Ramsey), a cute West Hollywood party boy, goes from man-to-man without much commitment. Opposites attract when Aaron and Christian meet, and sparks begin to fly.\n\n&quot;Featuring two star-making performances from Sandvoss and Ramsey, the film also features a terrific supporting cast including Mary Kay Place, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and international screen legend Jacqueline Bisset,&quot; according to the DVD sleeve description. Not to mention some sweet vocalizations from Rebekah Jordan (as Julie), the stock sympathetic roommate. Debuting director Cox turns his otherwise ordinary &quot;Latter Days&quot; into a enjoyable and touching drama, due to some story surprises and an engaging team.\n\n******* Latter Days (7/10/03) C.

As he so often does, Duvall steals the film but he has tough competition from the likes of Cusack (brilliantly cynical), Meredith &amp;, of course, De Niro. I have watched this film several times &amp; have even transferred it onto DVD so that I may continue to enjoy it. If you&apos;re looking for thrills or excitement, rent something else. But if you&apos;re looking for good characters, a believable plot &amp; a strangely unforgettable film, I recommend this one."

      "reviewBody": "Director Mick Garris has commented on how &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; was a troubled production, and one only has to watch in disbelief to see what he means. Before its 1992 theatrical release, I remember the film being heavily hyped as Stephen King&apos;s first foray into cinema with a completely original screenplay (and as was true with most adaptations of his work--with or without his involvement--at the time, the reviews were less than sympathetic). Ironically, Garris would become better known for helming TV-miniseries versions of some of King&apos;s best-known works (&quot;The Stand&quot;; &quot;The Shining&quot;; &quot;Desperation&quot;), directing right from the author&apos;s own scripts. Needless to say, these made-for-TV works outshine &quot;Sleepwalkers,&quot; which simply further proves that King&apos;s writing style (heavy with internal dialogues and detailed, unspoken perceptions) is better suited to a format that can fully develop his themes and characters. This tale of an incestuous mother/son duo who shapeshifts into bloodthirsty felines, roaming from small towns to dine on virgin prey, is fairly decent for the first 50 minutes--King&apos;s use of &apos;local color&apos; (and the resulting humor) is well-rendered, and Garris does a fine job of creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. But just when &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; seems headed for the zone of good (if not truly memorable) King adaptations, its final third devolves into overblown, ridiculous action sequences (as though the producers chopped away 30 pages of King&apos;s script for explosions and shootouts) and a queasy imbalance between absurd humor and sentimental melodrama. The end result hobbles the overall experience--had King&apos;s ideas been thoroughly fleshed-out, &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; may have been a solid entry in his filmography...but as it stands, it feels like a lament over what could have been. The cats are incredibly cute, though.",

      "reviewBody": "On the verge of separation from his wife and crippled by harrowing writer&apos;s block, Richard Dunn (Jeff Daniels) settles himself into a friend&apos;s summer cottage to work on his second novel. His only companion is Captain Excellent (Ryan Reynolds), a Superman-like superhero who exists only in Richard&apos;s mind. Solitude doesn&apos;t seem to do the trick, however, and he soon finds himself looking for ways to procrastinate. On a trip into town, he meets and befriends Abby (Emma Stone), a local teenager with a haunted past and only one real friend, a strange boy named Christopher (Kieran Culkin). The two become an unlikely pair and begin to spend more time with each other against the advice of both Captain Excellent and Christopher. Soon Richard is forced to question his life, his relationships, and his profession.\n\nThis is a difficult movie to sum up. In essence, &quot;Paper Man&quot; is all about relationships and human interaction, though that may seem difficult to comprehend given that one of the characters is a figment of another&apos;s imagination. And yet the interconnecting relationships of Richard and Excellent, Abby and Christopher, and Richard and Abby serve as an illustration of human needs and co-dependence. None of the main characters are complete persons and as such, each needs the other. Directors Kieran and Michele Mulroney give us carefully crafted, well-honed characters that rarely stray from their tendencies as they grow together and therefore, apart. Likewise, all of the leads give outstanding performances and fit their roles perfectly. Daniels and Stone display a natural chemistry that embraces the oddness of their relationship. For perhaps the first time ever, Richard and Abby are allowed to be themselves in each other&apos;s company and that comes through beautifully. Stone, in particular, is perhaps more vulnerable and authentic here than in any other movie she&apos;s been a part of. Only Lisa Kudrow feels out of place as Richard&apos;s overachieving wife, a one-dimensional character who at times fits a tired cliché than she does embrace real humanity. That&apos;s more than a bit of a disappointment given than none of the other characters or their interactions stray into the cliché abyss. &quot;Paper Man&quot; is quirky and original with dark overtones that give it depth and edge and a tremendous collection of talent that doesn&apos;t go to waste. Quite frankly, I loved this movie and found myself drawn to it with more intensity than just about any film I&apos;ve seen recently.\n\nMy site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

      "name": "Fine documentary about stand-up comedy",
      "reviewBody": "This documentary follows Jerry Seinfeld during his efforts to become a working stand-up comedian again, after almost 15 years of absence from the stage. But even for a man his caliber, it&apos;s far from an easy job to come back on stage just like that. He&apos;s got the cheers upfront because he is a celebrity, but once the initial welcome applause is gone, it&apos;s the material that counts. But it seems behind every minute of stand-up comedy is a hundred hours of hard work, with weeks of brainstorming, writing, and trying out new material on hackling audiences. &quot;Twenty minutes in three months&quot;, he states. Seinfeld also talks shop with a number of friends and colleagues in the business, including Robert Klein, Ray Romano, Chris Rock, Garry Shandling, Jay Leno and Bill Cosby. \n\nDon&apos;t expect this documentary to reveal much about the private life of Jerry Seinfeld. He is self-assured and confident - no surprises there - and is always in control. He is only followed when working at his act, but we do get an occasional peek at his wife and kid, for instance before his appearance on the Tonight Show. But this documentary also shows us the struggles of Orny Adams, a young, cocky and insecure comedian, who tries to make to make his mark in show business. \n\nLet me state this now. Orny Adams is not a funny comedian. He&apos;s not funny at all. Off-stage, he has a few funny observations, but his act is terrible. But he did invoke some sympathy with me, or empathy, so you will, with a fascinating portrait of his struggles. But I never really understood why they chose him. Obviously, the crew used him for a documentary about Seinfeld, but not on criteria based on comedic talent. To me, it was astonishing and very revealing that Seinfeld never even met Orny Adams before the filming of this project started. I think there is one scene where they meet in a club and have a short conversation. On the DVD Seinfeld casually reveals he never spoke to him again since! Not because they had an argument but probably because he is not in the least interested in Orny Adams. Jerry Seinfeld is well known for not having many friends and not mixing work and private life, but this? \n\nBack to Orny for some final thoughts. I always wondered whether Orny actually was a real guy and not some actor? I still do think he is an actual comedian, but with a name like that? In a restaurant in Montréal, the waitress asks for his name and doesn&apos;t believe him and proclaims: &quot;Get out of town. No mother would name her kid Orny.&quot; He insists that it is in fact his real name. Well... perhaps one mother did, or it is his stage name. I don&apos;t know. Fact is, although he&apos;s not funny at all, I liked the portrait and I liked the whole film and found this a fascinating insight in the world of the stand-up comedian. Every Seinfeld-fan has probably seen this already, but I imagine this must be an enjoyable documentary for everyone.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 8/10"

      "reviewBody": "I was searching a review from a Japanese reviewer and found one, very tough with the film. It made me react here.\n\nFirst, I consider myself as neutral as nor American nor Japanese even if I know those two fascinating countries inhabitants a little. And I did not feel the same the Japanese reviewer did. In my sense the film does not mock Japan. It does not show Japan as &apos;inferior&apos; but as different. And this is all the interest of this film whose purpose in my opinion is to show the opposite mentalities and culture. Both sides are presented. The bad and the good ones.\n\nThe Bad : Japoneses are showed as ridiculous with red tape and bureaucracy matters, with shy behaviors, weird violence (for occidental people). But Americans too. Those are presented as brutal stupid beasts, for example when Charlie Vincent run after a motorbike without understanding the trap is going into or when Nick Conklin does not manage to restrain himself from knocking everywhere. Or when Nick signs a stupid sheet of paper without distrust. The two Americans are also presented as arrogant as they don&apos;t even think that foreigners could speak English .. because they don&apos;t imagine it is even possible. Even the American/Japanese prostitute rejects their arrogance. Also American police is presented as corrupted and messy ... So no one wins here I guess.\n\nThe good : Japaneses are also presented as good. Cops are straight but cooperative and honor respectful, mainly instructed, efficient. Even if they lack of adaptiveness and are bad inspired to reject the American cops help. The mafia is well presented too. Franckly, they really are scary guys but gain respect with their honor code. Sato is impressive. \n\nHere I agree with the Japanese reviewer : The Americans are glorified (music helps :). Nick manages on his own (yet with the help of Mas) to solve a difficult case in a country he obviously even doesn&apos;t know. This is clearly the weakness of the film.\n\nYet what I really appreciated was the oppositions between Mas and Nick. Wiseness and honor of Mas, for example when he feels insulted by Nicks thief behavior or when he learns from Nick. Humanity and pugnacity of Nick.\n\nI also liked mafia&apos;s leader speech with Nick. Here we definitively can&apos;t say the film only runs for America, obviously.\n\nOne regret. We definitively see too little of Japan. Even if the film does much in presenting a country that we mainly bad know in occident, it could have done more. That said, I think this was not the purpose of the director who just wanted to focus on mindsets.\n\nAnother regret : the ridiculous sounds of the motorbikes especially in the beginning of the film and in the last scene. \n\nThe actors are all perfect. The soundtrack is really cool. Contrarily to the Japanese reviewer, I appreciated the way the director represents Japan, with subtlety, as Japan is all about. And USA with strength, as USA are all about too, sometimes too much :). If the oppositions between the two countries are exaggerated, it is in the purpose of showing them better and make understand, I guess. This is a &apos;must-be-watched&apos; film for me. One of the best of Ridley Scott.",

Many people do not realize that she was also a singer, not just a dancer, until they watch Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, which she also starred in. Peter Lawford does his usual job as playboy-royale, but thankfully does not sing. Astaire&apos;s dancing feat of climbing all over his hotel room is unparralled. No one else could do it and still look good! A great family film."

      "reviewBody": "Context is an important element in viewing any work of art or commerce and movies are both.  &quot;Red Dust&quot; at it&apos;s core is about human weakness and strength, in degree and in full force.  Mary Astor, a star since appearing opposite John Barrymore in &quot;Don Juan&quot;, plays a repressed wife who doesn&apos;t believe in the strength of her husband (Gene Raymond) nor her own weakness when it comes to resisting the animal magnetism of rubber plantation owner Dennis (Clark Gable).  Conversely, Gable doesn&apos;t realize his weakness in letting himself get involved with the ladylike Astor and underestimates the strength of prostitute Vantine (Jean Harlow) who, when Astor shoots Gable, gives witness to Raymond that his wife is innocent and that Gable deserved shooting.  For it&apos;s time, 1932, &quot;Red Dust&quot; is sexually progressive, showing the freely running passions of Gable and the two women, while in retrospect, it&apos;s depiction of Asians is as poor stereotypes.  Willie Fung, who plays Gable&apos;s houseboy, is also derided as gay in the script by the line delivered by Jean Harlow.  Harlow notices Fung giggling at her underwear, to which she replies &quot;Gee...you even find them in the jungle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Red Dust&quot; has a tremendous &quot;back story&quot; as well.  John Gilbert was to play the part of Dennis originally as an attempt to bolster his masculine image which had been damaged by the higher-than-anticipated timbre of his voice as recorded by early sound equipment.  With the sensation caused by Gable when he returned Norma Shearer&apos;s slap in the face in &quot;A Free Soul&quot; Gable&apos;s star rose mercurily.  No &quot;hero&quot; ever countered the indignation of the leading lady before, and certainly not the divas at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  Gable was a whole new breed of leading man.  Jean Harlow&apos;s star had been on the ascendant after scoring a huge hit in &quot;Red Headed Woman&quot; a scandalous story of a secretary who sleeps her way to the top.  The realism of these two performers in those films made them a natural for the raw jungle tale of passion and betrayal.  In the middle of the making of the film, Jean Harlow&apos;s producer-husband, Paul Bern, was found dead.  The scandal that followed frightened the studio who thought that Harlow&apos;s career was over. Scandal had ruined the careers of Fatty Arbuckle and Clara Bow, causing their studio (Paramount) to loose millions on their films.  M.G.M. was surprised when Harlow&apos;s fame and popularity increased.  For her part, Harlow returned to the studio and never spoke an unkind word about her late husband.  Bern, it turned out, had a common law wife who had emerged from years-long institutionalization and confronted him about his new wife.\n\n Racism is not a key element in the plot of &quot;Red Dust&quot;.  For that, you would have to see &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; where the Asians are neither lazy nor stupid, but sexual predators, instead.  Or you could watch any number of other World War Two American movies with Asians in them.  But for accurate Pre-censorship Hollywood adult dialogue and plot, &quot;Red Dust&quot; will do nicely, thank you."

It results to be a strong rendition of H.G. Wells&apos; novel about an isolated scientific who has spent several years creating half-animals turning beasts into half-human . Good secondary cast as Fauriza Balk , William Hootkins and Temuera Morrison . Ron Perlman&apos;s sturdy acting , displaying a magnificent portrayal of one of the beasts . Watchable by excellent makeup by the late Stan Winston . Colorful cinematography filmed in Queensland , Australia , by the classic cameraman William A. Fraker and atmospheric musical score by Gary Chang . The motion picture is middlingly directed by John Frankenheimer and the director&apos;s cut version runs several minutes more . The movie will appeal to Brando devotees and Val Kilmer fans who will want to check out their excessive performances . Other adaptation based on H.G. Wells&apos; known novel are the following : The classic of 1933 titled ¨The island of lost souls¨ by Erle C. Kenton with Charles Laughton , Kathleen Burke , Bela Lugosi and Richard Arlen ; and 1977 retelling by Don Taylor with Burt Lancaster , Michael York , Barbara Carrera and Nigel Davenport .",

      "name": "It&apos;s probably never to happen to anyone in real life, but you would be duly entertained by this fluffy romantic comedy",
      "reviewBody": "This reviewer had always dreamed of meeting his true love while touring the streets of Paris. How romantic would that be, to experience love at first sight while strolling in the City of Love. Language barriers aside, this would be a dream come true for any die hard romantic. But what if this idealistic reviewer were to meet a fellow Singaporean who spouts the ever familiar Singlish phrase &quot;What are you doing here ah?&quot; – would things as romantic as he hoped things to be?\n\nThere is a similar situation in this Thai movie. Just when you thought that the Thais have nothing new to offer except horror flicks, Muay Thai action movies and kitschy comedies, here comes a refreshing romantic comedy set in Korea. Yes, the very accessible movie takes place in the country that has its boybands and girlbands taking over the international pop industry by storm.\n\nThe plot is simple: A guy and a girl visit the Land of Kimchi separately, and eventually bond together after coincidental encounters, sharing of rooms and confessions of heartbreaks. Do they end up going back to Thailand together to share a &quot;happily ever after&quot; together?\n\nDirector Banjong Pisanthanakun (Shutter, Alone) ditches his familiar horror genre to helm this entertaining holiday romance which will be a hit for all you couples out there – there is a reason why the 127 minute movie made big bucks in its home country and became the highest grossing movie of 2010.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven minutes? Yes, you read that correctly – running at over two hours long, this movie goes on quite a bit before you get to find out whether there will be happy ending for the two protagonists. Call this reviewer a unromantic Scrooge who has no one to share the lovey dovey moments with if you will, but there are many unnecessary plot developments which make this movie overlong.\n\nGrudges aside, this Korea funded popcorn movie is still a joy to sit through, largely thanks to its appealing cast. Headlining the production are Chantawich Tanasewi and Nuengtida Sopon, who are extremely pleasant as leads. Tanasewi exudes a boyish charm which makes him instantly likable, while Sopon has a sophisticated personality which makes her girlishly charismatic. The two of them are the kinds of friends you want to travel with, and that makes this journey extra enjoyable.\n\nAs romantic comedies go, you shouldn&apos;t expect much in terms of characterisation or plot developments. The filmmakers have played the game by the book and managed to chart a predictable itinerary around Korea. While it serves as a great date movie, the production also serves as a visual guide around some of Korea&apos;s prettiest sights (that&apos;s probably why the Koreans have decided to fund this project as well).\n\nWhat&apos;s particularly interesting though, is how the filmmakers have managed to portray a picture of how the Korean pop culture has taken over the world by storm – watch how a certain Bae Yong Joon is spoofed in a restaurant scene. You&apos;ll chuckle at the rather genius move taken by the scriptwriter, and hope that one day, it will be you experiencing an overseas romance as picture perfect as this.\n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n",

A group of sociologist filmmakers starts doing interviews with different people. They grab them on the streets, at their work, or anywhere else. There are little fascinating snippets like the girl who used to make fake antiques. There are a lot of rambling discussions about anything. It must have been unlike most cinema from that time. This may not be the absolute first, but it is pushing the envelope wide open. I do find myself falling in and out of the film.",

Sivan plays with the concepts of light and dark, shadow and sunlight to depict the ambiguities that underline human sexuality. Swetha&apos;s shock and incredulity at the idea of her beloved uncle being a woman in a man&apos;s body is a clever device to distance and familiarize the audience with the third sex. Often, the director&apos;s camera tends to flirt with exotica, but not at the cost of the plot. There are long passages of soulful visuals, for example the eunuchs huddled in a dreamy blur at the fair dressed in widows&apos; whites after marrying the deity Aravan...here the cinematographer in Sivan coalesces with a gentle jolt in the director. on the whole, this movie is a worth watching....",

      "reviewBody": "Five-year-old Glendale, California tyke Shirley Temple (as Shirley Blake) hitch-hikes to the airport to visit her godfather pilot James Dunn (as James &quot;Loop&quot; Merritt). Not many kids could do that today. While she&apos;s away, we meet the curly top&apos;s family. She lives with mother Lois Wilson (as Mary Blake), who works as the maid for a wealthy family headed by another former &quot;silent film&quot; star, Theodor von Eltz (as J. Wellington Smythe). His snooty wife Dorothy Christy (as Anita) decides to fire mother Wilson for receiving too many telephone calls. However, their obnoxious but deep-down softie uncle Charles Sellon (as Ned Smith) likes Ms. Temple. He calls her &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. The illustrious cast includes servants Jane Darwell and Brandon Hurst. But the most memorable member of the household is Ms. Temple&apos;s antithesis – the classic spoiled brat character played by Jane Withers (as Joy Smythe). She decapitates dolls and terrorizes wheelchair-bound uncle Sellon from her tricycle...\n\n&quot;Bright Eyes&quot; was a very successful early vehicle for Temple. The cartoon-like film captures all of her adorableness. Temple sings &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; with the girlish innocence (some say sexuality) of a bygone era. Her amateurish vocals balance the perfect doll-like looks. The film has all the subtext depression-weary audiences loved – most importantly, undeserving and insufferable rich characters are put in their place by the angelic, suffering poor. Temple won an &quot;Academy Award&quot; for her cumulative work in 1934; this film has been mentioned as the one most responsible for bringing her the juvenile acting award, but contemporary reviews and research give the honor to &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (1934). In the earlier film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; rated Temple&apos;s performance higher than co-star Adolphe Menjou. Until the end of the decade, Temple would play variations of her &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; character, ringing up box office cash registers like no other child star, before or since.\n\n****** Bright Eyes (12/20/34) David Butler ~ Shirley Temple, James Dunn, Jane Withers, Charles Sellon",

The humour does not rely on the dialogue, as there is hardly any, but it does not rely on physical humour either. Instead, the puns come from the way in which Tati sets up the shots. The mathematical precision of certain sequences, and the way that the actors are positioned within the frame, are what is amusing. The jokes are much more subtle, not hand-delivered, and therefore there should be more that can be picked up on multiple viewings. One of the funniest scenes gives a building two moving eyes, thanks to a clever set design and great lighting. The art direction is simply excellent, the music is wonderful, and the timing for every shot is just superb. Not everything is brilliant though. The continuity is a bit off at times, no thanks to some awkward jump cutting, and towards the end the jokes become a bit repetitive and tiresome. There is also little plot, but there is certainly a satisfactory amount of storyline, it being an original take on the fish-out-of-water plot line. The supporting characters are silly, but they actually benefit the film here. Characters such as the neighbour show just how out-of-touch some persons are in the technology crazed world. This film may not be for every taste, but I simply found it delightful stuff myself.",

      "name": "More than just a Hamlet Adaptation",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Banquet&quot; is a loose adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; which, I believe, is Shakespeare&apos;s most powerful literary creation, and one which has been adapted (as I count) 5 times in the silver screen (my personal fave is the version with Mel Gibson; I have yet to watch the one with Ethan Hawke). This adaptation is so loose that oftentimes it feels like it has its own originality and only drew inspiration from &quot;Hamlet&quot;. \n\nOne of the original aspects of the film is that of the character played by Ziyi Zhang, which is a product of a revision of the original script. A revision which added quite a depth to the storyline. Gong Li (Memoirs of a Geisha, Miami Vice, Farewell My Concubine) was originally supposed to play Zhang Ziyi&apos;s part. Maggie Cheung (2046, Hero) was also considered for the role. Due to scheduling conflicts. When Ziyi Zhang took over the part, the script was rewritten to make the character younger. Her character is a former love interest of the Prince Wu Luan (the main character) but was later wed to the Prince&apos;s own father and eventually, to become the Empress to his uncle. Such a character has given a large amount of dramatic tension to the storyline and further complicates it, making the story more unpredictable even though it is an adaptation. \n\nIt is such a wicked delight to see Ziyi Zhang play such a dark snake of a character in this movie, a character who claims a love which is actually of self rather than something pure. Since her breakthrough in &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; she has proved time and again that the potency of her talent doesn&apos;t easily wither, and in her youth she has already made great performances, more than enough to satisfy a cinema-acting retiree. Likewise, impressive performances from Daniel Wu as the Prince Wu Luan, (the alluring &amp; yummy) Xun Zhou as the Opheliac Qing Nu, Jingwu Ma as the wise Minister, and You Ge who also deserves much praise for playing the Emperor Li, a character who defies being generalized as black &amp; white; a character which is richly layered with many levels. THE BANQUET is mainly drama, You do not watch this film for the Martial Arts, even though Yuen Woo Ping has a hand in the making of this film as both producer and action choreographer (I would consider Yuen Woo Ping as the living god of Martial Arts movies, having directed timeless classics like &quot;Snake in the Eagle&apos;s Shadow&quot; &amp; &quot;Drunken Master&quot; until now, &amp; was given international spotlight when he worked as Fight choreographer of &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies), but you watch this movie for its beautiful storyline. Although there are moments that induce awe in some of the fight sequences, these are expected to be minimal compared to the dialogue-driving motion of the film. It may even be observed that the martial arts here is a mere icing on the cake. \n\nAlong with that icing is the amazing visuals that it presents. From flying stunts, to set designs to costumes. You can feast your eyes upon the visuals, which wakes up viewers from a possible boredom. It employs a semi-surreal style of setting. \n\nIt seems that ever since it broke into worldwide popularity, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; has opened the floodgates for Chinese dramatic epics which are done in &quot;closed form&quot; of movies, movies which such a forced unnatural ambiance that generally use wire-works to do fantastic martial arts feats and exaggerated vibrancy and style on sets which depict surreal environments (although this style was long used in Hong Kong, but mostly only for action epics). But this type of fantasy-like genre was getting old and it needed to be complemented with really good story lines. Such was achieved by Yimou Zhang&apos;s &quot;Hero&quot; (which starred Jet Li &amp; Donnie Yen). This same surreal &quot;closed form&quot; style is employed by THE BANQUET. \n\nTHE BANQUET is powerful, dramatically rich, and such a masterpiece of a work, as dark and beautiful as the Shakespearean tragedy from which it is based on.",

      "reviewBody": "STORM RIDER: CLASH OF EVILS (2008) is an epic animated feature co-produced by Hong Kong and China and is, I believe, the first animated adventure I&apos;ve seen that was based on a Hong Kong comic book. It&apos;s quite a spectacular swordplay fantasy, with intricately choreographed fight action and expertly detailed backgrounds that evoke an ancient and mythic China. It has a strong storyline and a host of interesting characters and never flags during its 99-minute running time. It was directed by Hong Kong director Dante Lam, who&apos;s known for such live-action thrillers as BEAST COPS, JIANG HU: THE TRIAD ZONE, and THE TWINS EFFECT. Why this film isn&apos;t better-known is a mystery to me. IMDb lists release dates in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, but I have found no information on how it was received critically or how well it did at the box office. As far as I know, it never got any release outside of those regions. I found my import DVD copy in a Chinatown video store in New York.\n\nThe film is based on &quot;Storm Riders,&quot; a comic book by Wing Shing Ma that has been published in English by a company called Comics One. The comic was previously adapted as a live-action film called THE STORM RIDERS (1998), which starred Ekin Cheng, Aaron Kwok and Sonny Chiba. The animated film is something of a sequel in that it follows the two main characters, Wind and Cloud, after the events of the earlier film.\n\nThe animated story is a little on the convoluted side, but once you get all the characters straight by the half-hour mark, it&apos;s simply a matter of following what happens to Wind and Cloud. In the earlier film, they had been seen as martial arts students under the tutelage of Lord Conquer, a villain who had killed their parents and taken them as pupils to fulfill a prophecy laid out by a character called Mud Buddha. In that film they nurtured their plans for revenge and carried them out at the end of the film in a sequence that&apos;s recreated in an entirely new fashion at the beginning of this film. In the newer film, the two heroes acquire the power of the sacred Flame Kylin Sword, but it comes with a price. Wind gets the lion&apos;s share of the power but runs the risk of being possessed by it to the point where he might lose control and become a murderous all-powerful monster. Cloud has been ordered to kill Wind if this were to happen. After the events of the opening sequence, the two heroes are separated for a long stretch, during which Cloud is afflicted with amnesia and aligns himself with a band of street urchins, acting as their mentor and protector and earning the affection of Ying, the oldest girl in the group. Wind joins a group in another village and begins a relationship with a woman named Mong. Both protagonists wind up in the same town and on the same side in a battle with a marauding gang before they are eventually reunited.\n\nThere are three major action setpieces. After the opening flurry of fight scenes involving the confrontation between Lord Conquer and his two vengeful students, there is a welcome lull in the action in order to deal with Cloud&apos;s sudden amnesia, introduce new characters, and build up to the two sprawling battle sequences later in the film. At around the 50-minute mark, the Bat Gang, a group of vicious bandits, attacks the main town and their leaders are confronted, on separate fronts, by Wind and Cloud, who are both still unaware of each other&apos;s presence nearby. Later, after Wind and Cloud reunite, the two must confront Ao Jue and Duan-Lang, two young martial arts masters who covet the Flame Kylin Sword and its power. It all leads to a knockdown, drag-out fight in a massive clifftop castle which results in Wind losing control, thanks to the power of the Kylin Sword, compelling Cloud to recognize his duty to stop him.\n\nThe characters drive the story here and incidents occur based on what a particular character would or wouldn&apos;t do. As a result, the viewer becomes more engaged and emotionally connected to the action. It helps that the characters spend significant downtime with their friends and allies and get a chance to relate normally to other people. This is most evident in scenes where Cloud interacts with his young charges, the street urchins, after he&apos;s rescued them from the bumbling town constables. After the two protagonists are reunited, Wind watches as Cloud plays happily with the children. He turns to Mong and makes the memorable observation, &quot;I never would have imagined his happiest times would come when his past is forgotten. When you leave the anger and stubbornness behind, life changes entirely.&quot; This leads to a romantic interlude between Wind and Mong that&apos;s remarkably touching and something quite rare in this genre.\n\nThere&apos;s a beautiful music score by Henry Lai Wan Man that perfectly matches the breathtaking artwork, particularly in scenes of sprawling landscapes of farms, villages, fields, mountains and waterfalls. The fights are staged by an actual action choreographer, Wong Wai Fai, whose credits include Dante Lam&apos;s JIANG HU: THE TRIAD ZONE. The swordplay is mildly bloody at times, but the gorier parts are all kept offscreen. The DVD comes with both Cantonese and Mandarin language soundtracks, with English subtitles. I prefer the Cantonese track because the sound quality is better and the caliber of the voice acting much higher.\n\nSTORM WARRIORS II (2009) is a live-action sequel to the 1998 film, bringing back Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok in the roles of Wind and Cloud, but it has points in common with the animated film, including the threat of Wind going out of control. It&apos;s much darker and more claustrophobic than the earlier films and relies much too heavily on computer effects and CGI-created backgrounds. I prefer the animated film.",

This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn&apos;t think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.\n\nThe way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That&apos;s why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.\n\nIf you don&apos;t feel like it, don&apos;t watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving &quot;carefully&quot;, that has to be seen to be believed ...",

      "reviewBody": "Stephen Frears has created some powerful and very well crafted movies: &apos;Dangerous Liaisons&apos;, &apos;My Beautiful Laundrette&apos;, &apos;The Grifters&apos;, &apos;The Queen&apos;, &apos;Prick up your Ears&apos;, &apos;Dirty Pretty Things&apos;, etc. One would expect that his experience in dealing with edgy issues would make him the perfect choice for adapting the famous French writer of &apos;naughty novels&apos; - Colette - but somewhere in the flow of this production, perhaps in the Christopher Hampton&apos;s adaptation of the novel to screenplay, the original stories become perfumed and sanitized. And the reasons why this happened remain obscure. \n\nThe story is simple: courtesans in Paris must eventually retire form their lives of becoming wealthy through pleasing men of the higher class, and either they live out their lives in the luxuries of fluff or they must confront their aging and feel pangs of remorse as they end their lives alone, without a man to bolster them. Lea de Lonval (Michelle Pfeiffer) has been longtime &apos;friends&apos; with Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates), even to the point of nurturing Madame&apos;s son Chéri (Rupert Friend) as he approaches manhood. Madame asks Lea to &apos;polish&apos; Chéri for other women and after what might have been a brief fling in Normandy, the young Chéri and the aging Lea fall into a six year relationship. But as Madame realizes she needs grandchildren, she eventually finds a proper girl Edmee (Felicity Jones) for Chéri to marry. The remainder of the story is how these two age-disparate characters adapt to the &apos;social rules&apos; of La Belle Epoque, suggesting that even under extraordinary circumstances the power of love is an issue that must be confronted. \n\nDespite the performances by Pfeiffer and Friend (and even the miscast Bates) the story feels somehow sterile. Perhaps it is the out of place use of a male narrator who gives the film an unnecessary feeling of being a documentary, or the somewhat overused musical score of Alexandre Desplat, or the emphasis on costumes that hardly add to the beauty of Pfeiffer as Lea that keep the production grounded. It is a pleasant enough film, but hardly a memorable one. Grady Harp",

And it is great to be reminded of a number of the top notch filmmakers who were all still at work at the time in that country&apos;s great industry. My favorite segment is Torino, an industrial city which is not usually thought of as a top tourist attraction.Veteran &quot;calligraphic&quot; auteur Mario Soldati is our guide, and he points out the hidden surprises in his city. It is wonderful to see and hear this maestro in person. It is also curious that Venezia, one of the two top Italian tourist destinations, is not covered but instead we get portraits of less frequented places like: Bari, Cagliari, and Udine. There are large parts of this largely visual tour guide that don&apos;t have either dialogue or commentary, so if you can&apos;t find a subtitled copy you will still be able to enjoy a lot.

Delaney and Jean Hagen as the abused Mrs.Conovan, wife to a brutal enlisted man and the company&apos;s laundress. These two players make the most lasting impression by their very adroit portrayals of two kindred spirits irrevocably drawn to each other under impossible circumstances. Oddly, everyone else on the base (including the other Mr. Taylor-Robert, the star) seem to fade into the background, not evoking anywhere near the empathy that Don Taylor and Ms. Hagen manage.

      "reviewBody": "This movie is available on video, and I recommend buying it.  A problem with the bad movie genre (subgenre? metagenre?) is that it is dominated by science fiction and horror.  Well, this movie has elements of both, but it is mainly an adventure film gone horribly wrong.  So, it is often overlooked as a source of unintentional laughs.  Here&apos;s 10 good reasons to see it:\n\n1. Look at the tattoos in the opening and closing title sequence.\n\n2. Is it a historical drama? A pirate adventure? A monster movie? Who knows?\n\n3. Bad narration -- lots of it!  Could be missing pieces of soundtrack.\n\n4. James Aurness (sic) -- He was more expressive as the carrot in &quot;The Thing&quot;\n\n5. Bill Kennedy -- the grouchy costar was later a popular TV movie host in the Detroit area -- a special Michigan connection\n\n6. Fight montage sequence -- there must be stuff from 10 movies in here!\n\n7. You know, you can MOVE that camera!  But this cinematographer obviously wasn&apos;t aware -- he just turned the camera on, and people walked in and out of the shot.  Guess he was in the can a lot.\n\n8. The monsters fight each other, but pose no threat to the humans.  They should get guest star billing!\n\n9. If you can tell the two lead women apart, you&apos;re doing better than me.\n\n10.  Last but not least -- the finale features the world&apos;s most powerful handheld telescope as a side-splitting topper.\n\nI&apos;ve said enough -- and last but not least -- it&apos;s SHORT!  The best quality a bad movie can have.  This one&apos;s a winner, folks.",

      "name": "The Mundanities of Life",
      "reviewBody": "Life is strikingly uneventful for Willie, played by renaissance man John Lurie, who refers to himself as a hipster and lives in New York City, and his interactions with his Hungarian cousin Eva, played by avant-garde actress-musician Eszter Balint, and his best friend Eddie, played by yet another actor-musician Richard Edson, who dresses exactly like Willie. Indeed, both males are swarthy with hook noses and fedoras. They have such little interest in or knowledge of anything that their eventual vacation is no different from home.\n\nThe quirky way to three-act story format is a succession of single-shot scenes punctuated by black leader, and the clear-cut partition of the story into three straightforward, facetiously named episodes. Yet there are other ceremonial characteristics of substance: Tom DiCillo&apos;s black-and-white camera work, which provides Jarmusch&apos;s acute impression for the American panorama; and the arresting appliance of music, which favorably apposes Screamin&apos; Jay Hawkins&apos;s I Put a Spell on You with the folksy tinges of John Lurie&apos;s score for string quartet. This is definitely a road movie, but one with a distinction: Different from most instances of the then still immensely fashionable genre, Stranger Than Paradise appeared simultaneously comprehensively American and strangely European.\n\nThe oddly enlightening aggregate of involvement and reserve may be found in the film&apos;s lovingly absurd view of Willie&apos;s chic affectations, its quaint posture toward some of the inanities of American culture and in the way it harmonizes a decidedly American genre and decidedly American plot---if a narrative as gravely sparse and as concentrated on dead moments may be dubbed a plot---with all form of un-Hollywood expression. The look, rhythm, cast and mainly dismal feel bring to mind not The Blues Brothers, or even the rather subdued Last Detail, but the beginnings of the degree of minimalism to which Jarmusch would take his later work.\n\nHowever he also loves various attributes of popular culture. See how Willie and Eva watch Forbidden Planet on TV or go with Eddie and Eva&apos;s discouraged fancier to see a bone-crunching Hong Kong martial-arts flick at a Cleveland grindhouse, and lets them neighbor more virtuous aspects of his films, in such a way that there is no discrepancy between high and low. And it&apos;s for that scarce but wholly judicious mindset that Jarmusch is to be particularly noted. It&apos;s doable to distinguish his connection with a gamut of later American indie directors, specifically in his desert drollery, his passionately entertained captivation with slackers of sundry kinds, his concern with sequential framework, his affinity for severely subdued stories, and his clever, antiquated references to popular culture. All these, at a time scarce in American cinema, are now pretty ubiquitous. But the rhyme, the unabashed regard for cinema as a quality, production, expression, a realm, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance, even the mundanities of life and the most everyday scenery possible, that can confront crucial, important matters is far more difficult to come across.\n\nConsidering, in the end, no matter how amusing, stylized, minute or insignificant his films may strike one at first, they are always about something. For all his cinephilia, they&apos;re inspired not, like Tarantino and Rodriguez, by other movies, but by life: by real people, encountering real feelings. And while this black-and-white deadpan pop culture satire may be a comedy, an dissection of cinematic storytelling, and a thoroughly cynical yarn, it&apos;s also a film about America and the people who live there. It&apos;s about those people&apos;s connections to each other, and their connections to the rooms they populate, the city streets, the suburbs, diners and highways. And it&apos;s made by someone who knows there may be reality in abstraction, who finds a visceral alliteration separating a snow-coated Lake Erie and a barren Florida beach, and who fashions an implausibly true character like Aunt Lotte, always jabbering to her tender company in Hungarian, whether they&apos;re listening or not.",

This sounds just like the old TV show we all know and love, right? This plot is fine if you&apos;re in a 60&apos;s TV sitcom, but THIS IS PORN!!!!!!! I can see that in a non-porn movie the &quot;master&quot; who finds a genie might not have his every depraved sexual wish granted, but for cryin&apos; out loud, THIS IS PORN!! Yes, there is sex in this movie, but it&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t seen in other porn, and very little of it involves Jenna (also, Jenna never looks remotely like she does on the cover, but I&apos;ve come to expect this deception from all movie covers; see my other reviews). Here&apos;s my problem with this movie: this is a porno that actually follows a plot. In this plot, the guy who finds a genie has no sexual interest in her, and doesn&apos;t avail himself of her powers in any way (sexual or otherwise) Whaaaat? Even the cover says &quot;Who hasn&apos;t dreamed of having their own personal genie... especially one that looks like Jenna Jameson!&quot; And yet, this master has his own &quot;personal genie&quot;, one that &quot;looks like Jenna Jameson&quot; right out of her bottle, and he wishes for... NOTHING!!! What would you expect the master of a porn genie to wish for: His five favorite stars on his lap? A 20-minute orgasm? SOMETHING SEXUAL?? I guess I was expecting something more creative from this movie. Very disappointing.",

The film is not perfect; and not anyone will enjoy it. But it features a great performance by Lon Chaney and nice photography (incl. creative use of backprojection).

      "name": "Tense and intriguing WWII submarine drama about an implacable sea chase",
      "reviewBody": "Inexorable duel of great stars into a submarine and a destroyer . During World War II, an American destroyer escort &apos;USS Haynes&apos; (it was played by the real &apos;USS Whitehurst&apos;) captained by a tough skipper (Robert Mitchum) meets a German U-Boat commanded by an intelligent captain (Curt Jurgens) . Both captains are good ones, and the engagement lasts for a considerable time . Both of them pursuit one another and square off in the South Atlantic . This movie&apos;s closing epilogue states: &quot;Twentieth Century-Fox wishes to thank the Department of Defense and the United States Navy for their assistance in the production of this motion picture.&quot; \n\nThrilling as well as exciting battle of wits between two skippers who gradually come to respect each other . Both of whom are a compellingly balanced match as two clever as well astute captains . This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the relentless sea maneuvers of a destroyer going after a submarine and vice versa . The film is famous as one of the best WWII submarine movies, though some scenes at sea, however, suffer from the utilization of obvious models in a just as obvious studio tank . Interesting screenplay , being based on the novel by D.A. Rayner and the book and it&apos;s dust-jacket can be seen at the beginning of one of this movie&apos;s trailers . German player Curt Jurgens made his major mark on the international scene and it was American movie debut for German actor . The cast spent about a month filming on board this vessel. Many of the crew of the &apos;USS Whitehurst&apos; appeared in this movie. Secondary cast is frankly good such as Theodor Bikel , Frank Albertson , Russell Collins , and this picture marks the feature film movie debuts for David Hedison -as Al Hedison- and Doug McClure . 20th Century-Fox production notes for this movie from the AMPAS Library declare that the &apos;USS Whitehurst&apos; was a battle-hardened veteran from the Second World War which had during World War II been stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Harold Rosson&apos;s colorful and vivid cinematography , including spectacular maritime scenes , though set in the South Atlantic Ocean of World War II, this movie&apos;s ocean scenes were filmed in the Pacific Ocean. . The motion picture was stunningly directed by former movie star Dick Powell who efficiently captures the claustrophobic up and undersea tension ,; this was one of the final theatrically released movies of director Dick Powell who soon after worked exclusively in television. \n\nThis suspenseful sea epic represents one of a select group of a few World War II submarine movies which have won the one single Academy Award in a technical category, that&apos;s just only the one Oscar in either special effects or sound editing. These movies include ¨Crash Dive¨ ; ¨Torpedo Run¨ and ¨U-571¨. The non-WW II sub-movie, ¨The Hunt for Red October¨ also won just the one Oscar as did the WW 2 part sub-movie 49th Parallel , but for Best Original Story . Furthermore , other important films about submarine are ¨Run Silent Run Deep¨, ¨Crimson tide¨ by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman; ¨K19¨ with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and the best ¨Das Boot¨ (1982) by Wolfgang Petersen with Jurgen Prochnow .",

The film ends with speeches by the then big names in the party .It&apos;s rather boring.\n\nFor historians and sociologists."

Hence the movie can be seen as a light series of social shafts of wit, something Renoir has always been good at showcasing. He delivers this, his nephew delivers a really nice cinematography but on the whole it looks artificial and vain.\n\nNot a great movie so, but it&apos;s always a pleasure to see Bergman smile.",

      "reviewBody": "The Director&apos;s Notebook, a very off-the-cuff, stream-of-consciousness documentary by Federico Fellini, reminds me of what Terry Gilliam said in his introduction on the 8 1/2 DVD, of which this is so generously included. He said that once he went and shot a film in Italy and more specifically in Rome, he guessed that perhaps Fellini was perhaps more of a documentarian of what he saw in Rome than he was making up incredibly outrageous and fantastical visions. This time we as the audience get about as close as that can be (though Amarcord, and to an extent La Dolce Vita, come close too in their own ways) to the Rome that Fellini sees as real. We may not, of course, but it is of course all part of subjectivity when going into many documentaries. This time, we get a view inside Fellini&apos;s film-making style, his actors, some memories and locations and shots and &quot;lost&quot; sets and footage, and the un-reality of it all just pours more truth to the gobbledy-gook that sometimes makes up the film.\n\nAs with even the lesser Fellini moments, he doesn&apos;t leave fans totally without some fulfillment. It&apos;s something that is very much what Fellini would do, given what he wants to show the audience as his techniques and approaches. Right away we know this will and wont be your usual auto-bio into a director, as he gets some comments off some &apos;hippies&apos; who happen to be traipsing around the ruins of a film he planned to shoot (or not, as case may be, I don&apos;t know). Then he and the American narrator go on between seeing things being shot- and the sets of which shot by Fellini himself with the usual peering and following and moving camera- on Satyricon. But it&apos;s not just that, to be sure, as it is basically a look through notes, ideas, and much of what might be considered almost conventional in the Fellini-esquire sense. But it&apos;s still entertaining through it all, and I loved seeing a partial re-creation and look at Fellini&apos;s inspiration from the &quot;Old Rome&quot; he knew through silent films as a kid. Or the moments with Mastroianni. A nice diddy, which is now no longer a lost scene but now restored, is the sack-man scene from Nights of Cabiria hosted by Masina herself.\n\nAnd all the while, in tricky English, Fellini leads us along in his very bigger-than-life though somehow modest way of talking to us as his audience, through Roman ruins, coliseums, actors in screen tests, scenes being shot, seeing some strange things (one of which, maybe not as strange, is his own office), and other fragments that are very reminiscent of Fellini&apos;s comedies and tragedies. Nothing too revelatory, but just enough to keep Fellini fans salivating.",

      "reviewBody": "Cancer stricken Laurel Hester was a police woman in the New Jersey shore town of Point Pleasant, New Jersey when she was stricken with lung cancer. At the time of her diagnosis, she fought for her pension to be given to her partner/longtime companion/wife Staci Andree. The documentary shows the woman&apos;s battle for life and to help her partner obtain a sum of about $13,000 which isn&apos;t much but it would be able to maintain their modest New Jersey home. Laurel&apos;s fight could be symbolic of many in the battlefield. It&apos;s not so much about lesbianism as it is about politics in the garden state that is the most corrupt in the nation. The freeholders was resistant in letting Andree obtain the money probably to pocket themselves. Laurel and Staci&apos;s fight went public because it had no other choice. Laurel&apos;s colleagues at the police department also supported her right to designate her partner as the recipient of her pension. With all the revelations about New Jersey politics, politicians such as the freeholders which are more like county alder persons are the last people to make such a decision. It was Laurel&apos;s decision and she fought hard just as she did for her life. In the end, this documentary shows a loving couple regardless of their sexual orientation who fight to obtain what is really theirs. The fact that she was fighting from her deathbed is really heartbreaking. Here, she dedicated her life to fighting crime only to be almost denied of what was hers all along. The Ocean County Freeholders should be ashamed themselves for denying a dying woman&apos;s last request. By the way, New Jersey politicians have been double-dipping (meaning that they could be collected 2 pensions under the current plan) which is another aggravating circumstance. Since I live in New Jersey, the corruption is just awful and all politicians (even the former governor known as a &quot;Gay American&quot; could have came forward help Laurel&apos;s cause but he is too busy and is part of the corruptive mess). He doesn&apos;t care and neither does most politicians about the people like Laurel who came to serve their community. That&apos;s the real tragedy here. It&apos;s not about morals, judgment, or what&apos;s right but about the power of the almighty dollar. Ocean County probably wanted to take what was so little and probably use it for themselves. Without Laurel&apos;s pension of only $13,000, her partner Staci would lose their home since the property taxes are about that much in our state. It&apos;s not that much money to the politicians but it is to somebody who has already lost so much.",

I thought it was a nearly perfectly crafted film, and learned from the extras the director was 10 years in to the project, and intentionally used 32 different cinematographers to create his vision. Well it works.\n\nI noted to my wife I won&apos;t need to see it again, because it&apos;s seared into my brain.

      "name": "Blackboard Jungle is a breakthrough film that brings up important issues about urban schools.",
      "reviewBody": "I chose to watch Blackboard Jungle after I saw Rebel Without a Cause in Film class. I enjoyed the first movie and after I learned what Jungle was about, I assumed that I would enjoy it as much as Rebel. I was wrong; I enjoyed Blackboard Jungle twice as much.\n\nBlackboard Jungle premiered in 1955, the same year as Rebel Without a Cause and historical milestones such as Rosa Parks&apos; monumental protest of bus segregation. In fact, race relations pay an important part in this film, which I will discuss later. The movie is about a teacher, Richard Dadier, who accepts a job at North Manual High School. At this school, he encounters a school-wide discipline problem. The two main perpetrators in Dadier&apos;s class are Gregory Miller, a black student whom Dadier comes to see much promise in, and Vic Morrow, the true instigator of violence, whose gang attacks Dadier. Over the course of the film, Dadier also encounters apathetic teachers, a principal in denial, and a wife who gives birth prematurely. Eventually, Dadier must decide if his pursuit to teach is important enough to endure the hardship.\n\nThis movie brings up some very important issues that were just important in 1955 as they are in 2001. Violence in schools is still a major topic, culminating in the Columbine shooting which everyone should remember. Also important is how teachers are to deal with this threat. Dadier dealt with it by reaching out to Miller and by confronting Morrow. But is this a realistic scenario? Sometimes students just cannot be reached, and it is irresponsible to ask teachers to directly confront weapon-totin students who have a propensity for violence. This just goes to show that solving violence in schools is difficult. It has taken at least 46 years; it will probably take many more.\n\nNo female students are portrayed in Blackboard Jungle. This contributes to the stereotype that usually teenage boys are the ones who instigate violence. Of course, the statistics show that male students are mostly responsible for school violence, and many stereotypes exist for a reason. Rebel Without a Cause demonstrates the female role in school insubordination well, by including a woman in the main gang. Still, I would have liked to see a female student element in Jungle, to show that girls are often involved, and that they also influence male student&apos;s behavior.\n\nFor the era, the racial attitude of Blackboard Jungle is very progressive. Dadier confronts racial slurs in the classroom. The principal, who was tipped off by a student that Dadier was using racial epithets (when all he was demonstrating was the dangerous consequences of such racism), is not happy with this report and chastises Dadier. Both situations show that two important protagonists object to racism, signifying the film&apos;s aversion to this social aspect. This comes just after Brown v Board, simultaneous to Rosa Parks&apos; significance, and long before the high point of the Civil Rights Movement. Blackboard Jungle should undoubtedly be recognized for its attitude on race relations and other controversial elements, such as rock and roll. At a time when rock music was still controversial and outside the mainstream, Blackboard Jungle opened and closed with Bill Haley and the Comet&apos;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock.&quot; This was a bold step to take and was one of the reasons that the film was banned from many theatres. The relatively violent content also contributed to the barring of the movie and probably contributed to many riots that occurred in theatres while the movie was shown.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie, both for the issues it addressed, its support for educators and their responsibilities, and for its entertainment value alone. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in educational dilemma, or someone who simply would enjoy a classic film with a progressive, realistic attitude. However, for anyone looking for a clone of Rebel Without a Cause, they won&apos;t find what they&apos;re looking for, but I guarantee they will enjoy it just the same.",

The Trauma Spielberg handled in his movie is not to be found in here, but it&apos;s still and nevertheless a highly enjoyable, also well photographed movie with believable actors and a nice twisted ending (improbable, yes, but still nice). Whereas in DUEL one just had the man (Dennis Weaver is his best movie) and a truck (without the driver ever to be seen), Dahl added more characters and a more visible (actually audible) driver + police, etc, but the basic plot, people running away from mad truck/driver, is left intact. I just wish more such movies would still be made today ...",

They did not show the mistreatment of the family while they were under house-arrest. \n\nThe acting is amazing, however. From the soldier refusing his superior&apos;s orders, to the person responsible for moving the family (against his will? ambivalence) to the Tsarevich&apos;s friend, sad to see the family &quot;go.&quot; \n\nThe children behaved like real children, the mixed feelings everyone had about everything... it&apos;s quite deep, even if the story is very straightforward. \n\nThe moment the monarch is dethroned it becomes apparent that there was no escape for the family. Dissolving the monarchy did not satisfy the Bolsheviks, so the writing was on the wall.\n\nAll in all, it&apos;s a great, light-hearted film even if it&apos;s very sad at the end.

      "reviewBody": "David Boreanaz is not the world&apos;s greatest actor. I know this. He has good instincts, and has even been decent in some projects, but without an experienced director to really tell him what to do, he does tend to come off looking a little amateurish.\n\nDon&apos;t know who Ari Ryan is, but kudos to him for getting a film made. I&apos;m sure he was paid very well. But his direction is simplistic and camera-work uninspired (and at times confusing), and for the first hour, all the characters do is bark at one another, whining about how they&apos;re not going to take part in a heist that we already know from the first scene is going to take place.\n\nThere ARE a few good one-liners... but veteran actors like Peter Weller, Bruce Dern, and even Henry Thomas (hey, he&apos;s been doing this since 1982) know how to make it work. Gary Busey managed to act sober for nearly all of his scenes. Vera Farmiga was a year away from &quot;The Departed,&quot; and certainly does her best with what&apos;s given her, though that isn&apos;t much. Her character takes an unnecessary u-turn late in the movie, and she motivates it as best she can. But left field is left field, and lousy writing is lousy writing.\n\nThe rest of the performances just kind of lay there. To even call Nick Lachey an actor is an insult to actual actors. The plot synopsis promised two gangs of thieves doing a heist at the same bank on the same day, but the reality is that (a) it&apos;s not a bank, it&apos;s a jewelry store, (b) they&apos;re not thieves, they&apos;re amateurs, and (c) we see a bit of the heist in the opening scene, then we flashback and they spend 90 minutes talking about it, to get us back there. We already know it&apos;s going to happen, so where&apos;s the dilemma? Get to the good stuff, man, it&apos;s fun to watch RoboCop berate people and all, but no one&apos;s going to see your movie just because of Weller in a supporting role.\n\nReally you could ditch most of the movies first half; Henry Thomas&apos; character is at least interesting (the lovable loser), but then the movie takes a giant crap on everyone around him in the final act, making all that set-up completely irrelevant. Boreanaz&apos; half of the movie isn&apos;t interesting at all; His character is a selfish, materialistic jerk, and he&apos;s surrounded by selfish, materialistic jerks. The audience isn&apos;t interested. Get on with it.\n\nAs a short film, this might work. It was a good idea. Unwatchable action sequences, too much exposition and too many bad actors nearly ruin the whole affair. The few good actors make it watchable... but when it ends, you&apos;ll wonder what the point of the first 60 minutes was, if the filmmakers care so little about the characters they took pains to create.\n\n6/10. Someone give Henry Thomas a better movie, already.",

Hunter&apos;s mumbling is very clear for mumbles and it does not have that dark documentary look weh they shoot at night (most of the film) great DVD ad ons as well. Don johnson (another lucky neighbor of Owl Farm) reads along with pj o&apos;roarke and some other sot and it is interesting to hear hunter&apos;s words with others voices. The insanity it tempered with a visible devotion to his work and it is too bad this was not filmed post 9-11 since i believe some of his best work has come about since. In the end it is the difinitve (to date) piece on the Good Doktor."

      "reviewBody": "The teenager Loomis Crowley (Milo Ventimiglia) is testing the underground game Stay Alive with his friends Sarah (Nicole Oppermann) and Rex (Billy Slaughter). When the game is over, the impressed Loomis finds in the middle of the night Rex and Sarah dead in their room, and his is pushed by a shadow from the staircase, breaking the banister and hanging the same way he died in the game. Loomis&apos;s sister Emma gives his games to his best friend, Hutch (Jon Foster), and he joins his friends Miller (Adam Goldberg), Phineus (Jimmi Simpson) and his sister October (Sophia Bush), Swink (Frankie Muniz) and Abigail (Samaire Armstrong) to play the unknown game together. When Miller and Phineus die the same way they died in the game, the survivors disclose that the game is based on the life of the evil Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who was buried alive in the tower of her real state in the Geronge Plantation. With the police chasing them, and after the death of October, the survivors reach the house and try to find the corpse of the Countess to destroy her fiend.\n\n&quot;Stay Alive&quot; is flawed, but it is very entertaining and underrated in IMDb. The story is not scary, but a pleasant adventure with good special effects, the actors and actresses have good performances and show good chemistry. The attitude of the police chasing the teenagers is the flawed and silliest part of the plot, and is simply forgotten in the rest of the story. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Stay Alive - Jogo Mortal&quot; (&quot;Stay Alive - Mortal Game&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "Several of Walt Disney Pictures&apos; best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life&quot;, their follow up to the hugely successful &quot;Toy Story&quot; ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, &quot;Antz&quot;, &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life&quot; suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as &quot;Antz.&quot; The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don&apos;t build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some &quot;warrior&quot; bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children&apos;s film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make &quot;Toy Story&quot; an animated classic."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gangs of New York&quot; takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.  Those who felt they were &quot;native&quot; Americans did not want immigrants to enter their great country, spawning hatred between groups all over the city where many of them landed.  In the story we see how much of the town is run by one man, with William Cutting (&quot;Bill the Butcher,&quot; played marvelously by Daniel Day-Lewis) being the most feared and well-respected man of the &quot;five Points.&quot;\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who as a boy watched Bill the Butcher kill his father in one of the Points&apos; great battles.  Now a grown man, he returns to the Points to find Bill pretty much running the show.  He gets on Bill&apos;s good side and eventually becomes his number one man, all the while still plotting for his father&apos;s revenge.\n\nWhile there is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore, the film does an excellent job portraying life as it was in New York.  You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you don&apos;t need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.\n\nI&apos;ve never been a big DiCaprio fan, but his effort here (along with his performance from &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;) have made my opinion start to waver a little.  He is good as Amsterdam, and believable in his actions and expressions.  Daniel Day-Lewis is simply phenomenal as Bill the Butcher and really should have won the Best Actor Oscar.  Overall, I feel this was the best film of 2002 and really was robbed at the Academy Awards.\n\n8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "After getting thrown out of their last job and finding employment scarce in the United Kingdom, the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang see an advertisement for employment in the gold strike town of Red Gulch in the Yukon Territory. It&apos;s from a newspaper clipping and on the back there&apos;s a story about Chamberlain saying the country better be prepared for war. Off they go to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits.\n\nBy the way, it&apos;s case of misplaced Chamberlains. The clipping is forty years old and it refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War rather than Neville in the current crisis. But that&apos;s typical of how things go for this crew. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake.\n\nOf course when they get there it&apos;s a ghost town inhabited only by young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott. He&apos;s getting on in years and is a bit touched in the head. Marriott&apos;s got a gold mine that he&apos;s misplaced somewhere that he goes to in his sleep, that is when he&apos;s sleepwalking. The Gang better help him find that mine or otherwise pretty Ms. Kent won&apos;t marry stalwart trapper Anthony Hulme, but rather saloon owner Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death.\n\nThis was my first exposure to the Crazy Gang and I can see both why they were so acclaimed in the UK and why they never made any impact across the pond. The jokes come fast and furious and then were a number of things that the Code in the USA just wouldn&apos;t allow. The jokes are also strictly topical British and a lot just wouldn&apos;t be gotten over here.\n\nThe sight gags are universal, the final chase scene is worthy of anything that the Marx Brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you watch The Frozen Limits, tape it if you have a working familiarity with British history and run it two or three times just to make sure you pick up everything. It will be worth it.",

My vote is that Chan, once allowed to choreograph the fight scenes, just went ahead and directed the film, much as what happened with Bruce Lee and The Chinese Connection, another film claimed by Lo Wei that he didn&apos;t actually direct. In fact that&apos;s pretty typical for Lo Wei - probably half the films he made were directed by the actors while he was off gambling, drinking, or sleeping it off.\n\nAt any rate: Although the film is heavy handed and a little slow, the story is not without interest (this is one of the few &apos;fu films where we see a potential villain repent and become a good guy), and the performances are all above standard for this genre in the mid-&apos;70s. I believe this film, I believe its characters. Certaily not a masterwork, but a worthwhile dramatic &apos;fu film.\n\nOh, and the fight scenes are all pretty good.",

There are a lot of good stunts and chase scenes in this movie, as well as a long brawl towards the end with all the Cannonballers against a gang of bikers, led by Peter Fonda!\n\nTo quote the Brain Gremlin from Gremlins 2:  &quot;Check it out one time, won&apos;t you!&quot;  You won&apos;t be disappointed.",

Many hilarious scenes are missing and the writers have taken too many liberties with the plot.\n\nJonathan Taylor Thomas is wonderful as Tom Sawyer. Unfortunately his charm does not last until the very end of the movie, but seems to fade after a while. It might possibly have something to do with the fact, that, even though this movie is based on &quot;The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer&quot;, it&apos;s actually Huck&apos;s character that steals the whole show.\n\nI had a bit of a problem with the way Huck Finn was portrayed in this movie. Of course Brad Renfro is a fantastic actor (his performance is probably the best thing about this film) and he manages to give Huck Finn many tragic and deep aspects. Unfortunately Mark Twain&apos;s Huck Finn is neither tragic or very deep. One can only wonder why Huck has been made the brooding hero, when it&apos;s actually Tom Sawyer, who is supposed to be the brightest star in this story.\n\nDespite the many sugar-coated scenes and the fact that both Tom and Huck are a bit out-of-character, this movie is still something worth seeing. Injun Joe and Muff Potter are both realistic and Rachael Leigh Cook makes a brilliant and not-so-girly Becky Thatcher! The sets and wardrobe look very authentic, but they alone are not enough to bring the evergreen story wholly alive."

      "reviewBody": "Some critics here are saying the movie takes itself too seriously - but I believe some people are taking it too literally. ... Saying that the topics that are addressed have no impact on society anymore, clearly misses the point. ... The 50s -- or more specifically, 50s TV -- is used as a metaphor, because of the way 50s TV portrayed life in America. ... Thematically, this movie is about &quot;Living Life&quot; to the fullest, whatever that means. More specifically, to live life to the fullest -- to truly feel &quot;alive&quot; -- you need to take the good with the bad. Sweeping things under the rug and just acting &quot;pleasant&quot; all the time, is no way to live. That&apos;s what Tobey McGuire&apos;s speech at the end to his &quot;real&quot; mother is all about. Bad things happen, it&apos;s part of life. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives -- but suppressing true feelings for the sake of &quot;pleasantness&quot; is an empty life. THAT is the key ... and that &quot;issue&quot; is everlasting to the human condition. \n\nAnother point: People fear change. This is universal from the start of time until the end of time. The film suggests that changing and growing as a society and as people -- even if scary -- is good. Just because the 50s were used as a metaphor for that, don&apos;t believe for a minute this isn&apos;t a universal issue that exists today and forever.\n\nAnother issue common for people critical of this film is the sexual issue. They say that Gary Ross is promoting sexual promiscuity, sex out of wedlock, etc...  Again, I believe it misses the point.  Is Ross suggesting that premarital sex is OK?  Yes, and I&apos;d agree - and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty of people who don&apos;t agree with that, and that&apos;s OK too.  But, again, the sex is just part of the theme - used as a high-profile example to making the overall point about &quot;openness&quot; - and not suppressing one&apos;s feelings.  Note that the Reese Witherspoon character was already promiscuous, and her transformation was actually something completely different.\n\nI can&apos;t make everyone like this film - I&apos;ll just say that, on a personal note, I was so floored by this film, I had to see it again the next day. That had never happened to me before, or since. Ross&apos; commentary goes on to speak of everything I felt about the film when I first saw it. It was great to hear that his reasons for what he did, meshed exactly with how I took it. I had to write him a letter to tell him so - another thing I&apos;d never done before or since.\n\nThis is not a perfect film. I liked its subtlety, but then the racism correlation, and the censorship stuff, got a bit more overt. The courtroom scene at the end is a bit cliche ... and I also agree with one poster who said that, to make the point about taking the good with the bad, we should&apos;ve seen a bit more about the consequences of their actions.\n\n Those are merely nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. This is a 10 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Julie Walters is great in this story of a woman who starts off life working in a café but ends up being arrested for living off the immoral earnings made running a brothel for the great and the good. It&apos;s loosely based on the rise and fall of the renowned madam Cynthia Payne (who consulted on the drama) and reaches inside the murky sex industry, laying bare peccadilloes galore as we discover a wide variety of kinks that keep all ranges of society entertained and/or employed. &quot;Christine&quot; is a shrewd business woman whom aided by her stalwart &quot;Dolly&quot; (Danny Schiller); &quot;Shirley&quot; (Shirley Stelfox) and the RAF veteran Wing Commander - in panties and a bra - &quot;Morten&quot; (Alec McCowen) is making quite a go of her elicit enterprise. The police pop up now and again, but for the most part Terry Jones left me with thinking that this is actually quite an empowering drama. Certainly some of the women taking part do so out of necessity - and perhaps that is rather underplayed here - but we are also presented with the inescapable fact that human beings are all different and that the Victorian-era proscription of sex, and of sexual practices between consenting adults is long outdated and certainly no business of the state or their agencies. David Leland has written a script that is peppered with realism, sarcasm and proves ideal for the on-form Walters and her well targeted delivery. It does meander around familial discord a bit, which I didn&apos;t need - but the last few scenes speak (or should that be spank) volumes about the hypocrisy and double-standards that prevail in a society that should enjoy sex and keep it&apos;s nose where it belongs... It&apos;s good fun and thought-provoking in equal measure, and well worth a watch.",

There are three episodes, each covering a period of his life. First episode documents his early years until he became prime-minister(1889-1933).  The second episode documents how Hitler ruled Germany until the second World War began(1933-1939).  The third and final episode documents the war, how Germany lost, and his death(1939-1945). The episodes are accurate, and show us how Hitler became obsessed with killing the Jews and getting the &quot;Lebensraum&quot;(space to live on) for the German people. &quot;Hitler-eine Karriere&quot; is an important production, and I recommend all of you to see it."

He made the crime film Wenn es nacht wird auf der Reeperbahn in 1967, and the prostitution drama Der Pfarrer von St. Pauli in 1970, which are both quite good, so you understand why he wrote and directed it.\n\nBloody Friday is a more German version of the stylistic Italian poliziotto. It is tougher, more direct and also more over the top, I mean, it is sometimes TOO SILLY. The escape of Heinz Klett (great acting by Raimund Harmstorf by the way) on itself might be believable, but why would Heidi incriminate herself suddenly for her boyfriend Luigi, or would her brother do just the same for her? Just robbing a bank with a maniac, what can go wrong? \n\nThe heart of the film is this violent character Heinz. He is the cause of everything. How he bluntly accepts these amateurs for nothing less than a bank robbery, that&apos;s typical Heinz. He is like a caricature of a man, aggressive, sexist, opportunist and over confident. People who die just deserve it because they are weak, in his opinion.\n\nBloody Friday might look terrible at some point, but this film isn&apos;t as bad as it looks. It actually brings some surprising social undertones to the genre, which are usually lacking in poliziotteschi. The desperation from the other robbers give the film an humanistic context. Heidi and Luigi want to escape from their shitty jobs, while the brother is a deserter. It is also (very loosely) based on a real story, as Germany had to endure a lot of violence in this period – terrorism from extreme left wing organizations and violent bank robberies, not only by professionals, but also by amateurs, like in this film. I rate it 7/10."

Mute dinosaurs walking around wouldn&apos;t be interesting at all and remember, this is a kid&apos;s movie. And yes, the animation might not be as good as in Jurassic Park, but this is a fully animated movie, JP used a mix of animatronics and CGI inside an otherwise live action movie, and in a interview I saw, Spielberg (or if it was a special effects guy, I don&apos;t remember) said that they would use the animatronics when ever possible and only cover up rigs and refine movement with the computer &apos;cause the CGI models looked like crap in comparison the robots. And yes, the story has been used before, but so has the story in most films we&apos;re watching today, only in varying degree and in different mixes and it&apos;s not like Disney is known for their originality story wise. As good as everyone of their Classics are based or inspired by other works.\n\nPersonally I love this movie. The CGI is still good, and at times more realistic than many rushed animations we see today, the characters are fun to follow, unlike Land before Time were they were unbearable and made me hate the movie (even as a kid the first one was never my favorite) despite a similar story to Dinosaurs&apos;, which I by the way like, and the moral of it is a really good one.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m afraid I was disappointed by &quot;Fire over England&quot;, having pinned too many hopes on this film of all those in the Olivier season: based on a novel I&apos;d loved as a child, starring Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth with names such as Raymond Massey, James Mason and Robert Newton among the supporting cast, and featuring Vivien Leigh as the real-life love interest of a Laurence Olivier described as channelling Douglas Fairbanks and John Barrymore as he does all his own stunts, what could hold more promise? Like &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;, it was a picture I&apos;d heard of and had long since been waiting to see.\n\nBut great anticipation places an insuperable weight on a film. &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; disappointed, and Olivier is no Flynn. The character is petulant and callow, admittedly -- but I couldn&apos;t identify with Michael emotionally (not aided by the fact that he appears to be trifling completely untroubled with the affections of two ladies at once, which deprived the love scenes of their conviction: it didn&apos;t come across as a conflict of loyalties, but as having your cake and eating it), and I found the action sequences uninspiring. The stunt dives look like belly-flops (presumably with an eye to the angle of the safety nets), the &apos;storm-tossed&apos; ships wobble along with their sails obviously providing no propulsion whatsoever (would it have cost too much to have someone blow on them?), and the palace guards at the Escurial display a degree of stupidity in their pursuit that even in the context of cliché is less thrilling than ridiculous. The only moments of the Spanish adventure that worked for me at all were the double-edged dialogue at the dining table, and the &apos;spy&apos; scenes with Raymond Massey.\n\nFor the true honours of this production lie not with the adolescent hero but with the ageing generation. Massey invests the workaholic, melancholic Philip of Spain with a lethally plodding efficiency that makes him truly to be feared. The quietly-weighted exchange between the older Ingolby and his friend-turned-captor holds far more emotional impact than young Michael&apos;s histrionics when he finally cottons on (about a reel later than everybody else, audience included). The Queen&apos;s relationship with her boyhood&apos;s Robin is far deeper and better-portrayed than Michael&apos;s with Cynthia, and the memorable struggle is not Laurence Olivier with a sword in his hand but Elizabeth facing the loss of her youth.\n\nIt is the grown-up drama that is worth watching here. But unfortunately this is not the main focus of the motion picture.",

      "reviewBody": "A Boy and His Samurai is a perfect example of how to blend comedy, drama and emotions all into one mixture of a delicious cake. This film has a rare and unique quality that captures the audience attention from the beginning to the very end. In the midst of the film, it also have the ability to make you laugh, cry little and finishes off with a bittersweet smile. In essence this is a movie made for kids, but also an enjoyable film for adults to watch together. This is the kind of movie that Ninja Kids!!! fails to be and should have been. Putting in a Samurai of the 1800s Edo period into modern day Tokyo is a smart idea, but full credit must go to the entire likable cast of Ryo Nishikido, Rie Tomosaka and Fuku Suzuki. In particular Fuku Suzuki steals the show with steady child cuteness and the trio (Nishikido and Tomosaka) plays off each other with chemistry and fun. All in all, A Boy and His Samurai is one of those films that allows the audience to enjoy the experience, laugh together, carefree, light-hearted and engages the audience at an emotional level. It is a rare quality and the pacing is much faster than most Japanese movies. In doing so, A Boy and His Samurai is fast becoming a contender as the most enjoyable movie at the 15th Japanese Film Festival. A must see.\n\nNeo rates it 8.5/10.\n\n\n* www.thehkneo.com\n",

      "reviewBody": "This movie had the potential to be a great black comedy with the idea behind it, but it falls very short.  There is very little in this film that impressed me or made me laugh.  It&apos;s like a black comedy without the black (the film tried to be violent and gory, but looked little more than ridiculous) or the comedy.  The film is about a woman (Angela Jones) who quits her job and decided to go work for a company called PFCS (Post Forensic Cleaning Service) when she becomes fascinated with a serial killer known as the &quot;Blue Blood Killer&quot;, a psychopath who goes around Miami beheading rich women.  The company is a cleaning service that is called in to clean up the blood and guts left behind in homes in the aftermath of a murder, after the Cops haul the body and evidence away.  The premise for a company like this is funny (one of the only moments in the film that caused me to laugh was their T.V Commercial), but the end result is not.\n\nI can see why Quentin Tarantino was attracted to a project like this.  Word on the street is that this was originally a funny short film that was shown at Sundance in the early 90&apos;s and after the success of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Tarantino bankrolled this full length version of the movie and released it later on video with his &quot;Rolling Thunder Pictures&quot;. Tarantino seems to be very amused and fascinated with the idea of a cleaner or cleaning service to clean up the mess of the deceased.  He surely watched Luc Besson&apos;s &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; many times in the later stages of his video store clerk days and used the idea of &quot;Victor the cleaner&quot; for his Winston Wolf character in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  The idea of a &quot;cleaner&quot; is quite funny and worked very well in both films, but here, it simply does not work beyond the admitted hilarity of the T.V commercial and of the mock-up sensationalist reality-TV show excerpt in the middle of the film.  The rest of the movie is boring and pointless and the acting, apart from Angela Jones, is pretty stale.  If you want to see real black comedy that will make you laugh (and cringe, that&apos;s another thing this film was missing), I would suggest seeking out the early works of Danny Boyle (&quot;Trainspotting&quot;, &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;) and the Coen Brother&apos;s &quot;Fargo&quot; over a boring film like this.  4 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "Eyes of Laura Mars -- Horror/Thriller -- 1978\n\nThis is an old supernatural thriller of sorts from way back in the 70s&apos;. It revolves around a female fashion/glamour photographer who lives to make crude photographic nudie art that sepcializes in scenes of violence. Some people find her &quot;art&quot; to be rather disturbing and horribly offensive. So someone decides to go around killing her friends and acquaintances. To make matters worse, Laura Mars can see the murders happening--through her own eyes!\n\nHere&apos;s the breakdown:\n\nThe Good:\n\n--Clever story, and fairly original. Adds a nice twist to the usual cops-hunting-murderer story.\n\n--Good acting all around. Brad Dourif is creepy, Tommy Lee Jones is cool, Raul Julia is... kinda weird...\n\n--Good atmosphere and cinematography all around, with some strong direction. The tense moments are generally pretty well done.\n\n--Some nice, genuine, surprises throughout the film. It does manage to successfully keep you guessing just who the killer is.\n\nDidn&apos;t Hurt It, Didn&apos;t Help:\n\n--Contains a decent amount of fairly well-known actors including Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif (better known as Chucky from the Child&apos;s Play series), Raul Julia, and Rene Auberjonois (famous for his Star Trek: Deep Space Nine role). It was also co-written by John &quot;Halloween&quot; Carpenter.\n\n--Quite a bit of nudity. She is taking pictures of naked &quot;victims of violence&quot; after all.\n\n--Somewhat grotesque 70&apos;s music permeates here and there.\n\n--Some decent character development and depth.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n--Not quite as scary or riveting as I&apos;m sure it was back in &apos;78. This review being written in 2006.\n\n--Some &quot;logic&quot; problems every now and then. For instance, when Laura Mars sees someone being murdered, that&apos;s all she sees--yet there are times when she seems to be able to move around, once even driving a car, with more competence than one would expect from someone who just instantly &quot;went blind.&quot;\n\n--Occasional dips in the quality of the atmosphere and writing.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n--The make-up used on the models in the 70&apos;s. Holy crap!\n\nMemorable Scene:\n\n--Nice climax to the film.\n\nFun Fact:\n\n--The photographic art in the film is actually from professional &quot;glamour&quot; photographer Helmut Newton.\n\nActing: 8/10 , Story: 8/10 , Atmosphere: 7/10 , Cinematography: 8/10 , Character Development: 7/10 , Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 , Dialog: 7/10 , Music: 6/10 , Direction: 9/10\n\nNudity/Sexuality: 5/10 , Violence: 6/10 , Gore: 3/10\n\nCheesiness: 2/10 , Crappiness: 0/10\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\nFinally, I would recommend this to hardcore horror/thriller fans or film buffs. John Carpenter or Tommy Lee Jones fans will likely enjoy it. The movie is not without its problems, small though they are, but may not be enjoyed all that well by many modern viewers.\n\nwww.ResidentHazard.com\n\nhttp://bartboard.proboards3.com/index.cgi (Movie themed message board)",

      "reviewBody": "To me, this film along with &quot;Replay&quot; are the best of the five film series and for wholly different reasons. A high school girl (this is Aoi Miyazuki) lives with her father. She is picked on by three classmates and leads a fairly solitary existence outside of school until she meets Tomie (both are named Tomie, this is Nozomi Ando) who, it turns out, was the other Tomie&apos;s first love. Of course, that Tomie met her untimely end all those years ago, and she looks to rekindle with the father. This, however, involves the father having to kill his daughter, which he can&apos;t do so he kills the reincarnated Tomie instead. This film has the best special effects and the story unfolds and builds in an almost darkly comic way. While not a perfect film, the way the two Tomies play off each other is pretty effective. I&apos;d recommend the whole series (which is available on DVD as a box set), but this one and &quot;Replay&quot; get my nod for the most watchable ones of the five.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie&apos;s a riveting excursion into the occult. In fact, the production pulls off the difficult trick of making occult happenings seem almost plausible, something Hollywood rarely cares about doing. Robinson&apos;s turn is first-rate as a stage magician suddenly burdened with the power of pre-cognition. Watching Triton (Robinson) slowly succumb to the terrible reality of foreseeing the future amounts to a dramatic triumph. He has no control over these pre- visions and they&apos;re almost always of dark happenings, especially when involving the sweetly vulnerable Jean Courtland (Russell). The climax is a stunner as the clues to Jean&apos;s bleak future slowly come true, while there seems no alternative to fate having its evil way.\n\nThis is one of the darkest of noirs, both literally and figuratively. Generally, the lighting is too shadowy to catch the ethereal Russell&apos;s pale blue eyes, a feature that would have added to the overall mood. It&apos;s also nicely ironic that the real occult would step into the life of a magician who only pretends to conjure other dimensions for the delight of paying audiences. It&apos;s like a punishment for presuming to toy with the surreal. I also like the way others remain militantly skeptical since that would be a natural reaction.\n\nIn my book, the movie&apos;s clearly underrated by the professionals and I&apos;m not sure why. If the production&apos;s got an overriding flaw, I can&apos;t find it, though I could have done with less of the theramin whose eerie sound is like gravy on soup. Nonetheless, for me, the overall result is one of the best to deal with a topic that&apos;s usually made hokey as heck by Hollywood, and that&apos;s besides having one of the most intriguing titles in movie annals."

Actually, you can&apos;t really call it a &quot;family&quot; movie - it&apos;s strictly aimed at the juvenile set instead of having something for kids AND their parents. Correction - make that a particular juvenile set that has its classes in the basement of a school. The dopey tone and the extreme exaggeration of the heavies will even have five year-olds rolling their eyes.\n\nPoor Chuck; looking at him in the movie, it&apos;s obvious that he&apos;s past his prime. Watching him in action during the (badly choreographed and edited) fights, it&apos;s obvious that 99% that it&apos;s a double doing the action - since you only see his face 1% of the time in these scenes! (This was also very evident in his TV series after the first few seasons.) Actually, it&apos;s hard to feel any sympathy to him when you consider that he actually isn&apos;t in that much of the movie. Also, he appears utterly bored in his scenes. Well, at least Norris for once is showing emotion.\n\nIt&apos;s no wonder that this never got a theatrical release. It&apos;s an embarrassment to everyone involved. That is, except for the underrated Roscoe Lee Brown. He enters and leaves the movie with his dignity intact, giving a conviction to everything he says. What a performer, to be able to survive this!"

      "reviewBody": "This movie has less depth than Paris Hilton. It&apos;s basically a very old John Wayne going to Britain and kicking butt just the same way he&apos;s done it in dozens of previous films. BUT, on that level, it is a very good and enjoyable film. In particular, the film had wonderful &quot;Dirty Harry-like&quot; lines and a dark sense of humor. In fact, I half expected him to say &quot;make my day&quot;--it was so much like an Eastwood film. And, the film was much better than Wayne&apos;s previous attempt to knock off Dirty Harry in MCQ. So, provided you can also turn off all sense of disbelief (after all, Wayne was WAY TOO OLD FOR THE PART), you can enjoy it much the same way you&apos;d enjoy one of his older flicks such as THE FLYING TIGERS or THE FIGHTING SEA BEES. In other words, this is a 70s version of an old Republic Pictures action film--with a few updates to reflect the times (such as Wayne being saddled with a &quot;dame&quot; for a partner). Overall, if you hate John Wayne films then I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll hate this one and if you like him, this film won&apos;t disappoint. It&apos;s just good old-fashioned fun!\n\nBy the way, according to Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies, John Wayne was offered the role of Dirty Harry BEFORE it was given to Eastwood! You could tell Wayne wished he had taken the part since he soon went on to make his own variations on the genre.",

Check out Dennis Wilson&apos;s &quot;Funky Monkey&quot; dance since he&apos;s not singing.\n\nAnyway, this is a breed of film I wish they still made - goofy but not really stupid, a cute teenager comedy with a little innocent flirtation here and there, some very pre-PC dialogue, and a monkey who disappears from middle 3/4 of the movie. Some continuity problems, but hey, if you&apos;re looking for great cinema you shouldn&apos;t be looking at a film called &quot;The Monkey&apos;s Uncle&quot;.\n\nIf you&apos;re into chimp films (and if so, I really don&apos;t want to hear about it) and you rented this one expecting to see a lot of monkey, you will be frustrated. On the other hand, if you think Annette Funicello was hot, this is your kinda flick. &quot;Lost In Space&quot; fans will also enjoy seeing Mark Goddard as the BMOC.\n\nOtherwise, it&apos;s a cute little film to watch with young kids or by yourself when you&apos;re busting out code at home at 3 AM and it&apos;s either &quot;The Monkey&apos;s Uncle&quot; or an infomercial."

      "reviewBody": "Monicelli always went beyond the Italian comedy genre. His movies mocked the worst habits living inside his characters, with grotesques but reflective stories in ancient and recent Italy. This one is probably his last masterpiece (he&apos;s 92 by now) and if you haven&apos;t seen it yet, go rent it ! A typical southern Italy family reunites in the native home in Sulmona (Abruzzo) for Christmas Seasons. Apparently everything goes marvelously: the parents, 2 sons and 2 daughters, 1 nephew and 1 niece, and 3 brother/sister in law (1 bachelor and 1 couple without sons). Spending just two weeks a year together they always pretended to love each other, acting like a model family. Getting old, the mother Trieste, thinking to his older, sick husband too, during the big Christmas lunch, decides to ask hospitality with ONE and just ONE of the sons. A tragedy.\n\nInstead of the the idyllic family of the first half part, in the second the sleeping grudges and resentments came out explosively, discovering the painful realities about each one, the reasons for which they shouldn&apos;t take their parents at home, OK, but yet too weak to get out of the task. Thought it was a right, correct query nobody wants that burden inventing the weirdest excuses. The war burst on different fronts, reckoning every old rancor.\n\nThe perfectly built dialogues create a nice spectrum of the variegated accents of Italian language (north/south), as it could have happened everywhere. Either watching several times you can&apos;t find a hole in the script, thank overall to the skilled actors (Marina Confalone&apos;s plane sequence is excellent!). The hypocritical social substratum (typical of small towns) where that family grew up and blamed as vile for years, eventually permeated through them and led the dear offspring to that evil ending.\n\nA trivia: Cinzia Leone was substituted for the last scene at the party having suffered a fit in the filming dates. She still carries the after effects of that time with a facial paresis.\n\nThe most poisonous dark comedy made in Italy in the last 20 years, and probably ever. I recommend it warmly to all of you !",

The action of the movie was there, but the plot was major stinker. Being convicted of killing a policeman in a traffic accident is bad enough. But when the details are sketchy, there&apos;s a chance of high hopes for the character to regain control of his life. When heard most of the details, I hear that the police officer that died in the crash, was drunk. That can clear Danny Holt(Don &quot;The Dragon&quot; Wilson) of vehicular manslaughter, however, more rogue cops hamper his chances on redemption. This police Lt. Garcia(Liz Torres) is terrible. She won&apos;t listen to anything. She is so hardened against Danny, she don&apos;t care about anything else. Maybe one day, she&apos;ll learn the truth about open her eyes, and see the error of her views. The action scene remain intact, and the the kitchen scene is unforgettable. Especially when the young woman gets burned on the stove during the fight with Danny. This movie was fine, it just a little downhill there. 1 out of 5 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "Being born blind necessitates accommodation to the sighted world from day one, but what kind of struggle does a person face when blinded much later in life.\n\nIn Hugues de Montalembert&apos;s case, not only was his sight taken away but it was the primary sense he utilized for maintaining his chosen profession as a painter. All it took was one mugger&apos;s desperate gesture to render him disabled and forever unemployed.\n\nRather than try to re-create the circumstances and do a straight interview with Hugues, director Gary Tarn has undertaken a much more artistic approach to show just what has been lost when you leave the sighted world for one of darkness or extreme blurriness.\n\nWhile Hugues retells his struggles during the intervening years, the screen is filled with images of life in New York city and occasionally the blurry view that Hugues would have of the same scenes the viewer can observe with perfect clarity.\n\nNot for all tastes, but if you&apos;re sick of &apos;talking-head&apos; fact-flicks then this meditation on loss and rehabilitation could be of value. You never know when you might find yourself struck blind either accidentally or as the victim of a crime. This film helps to fill in some of the details of that worst-case scenario."

      "reviewBody": "This Spaghetti/Faglioli Western is starred by two outlaws : &quot;The doctor&quot; (Bud Spencer in his habitual role , as always , and this time without Terence Hill) and the Indian Gironamo (a likable Amidou ) . At the beginning Buddy posing as Indian rescues Gironamo and after that , they rob a train . Later on , they come to Yucca City , where the citizens believe he is a doctor . Meanwhile , they are helping townsfolk to fight a gang led by Colorado Slim (Riccardo Pizzuti who usually receives kick ass) who is ¨Wanted : Dead or alive¨ and a suspicious sheriff named Bronson ( Joe Bugner who worked in various films as Spencer nemesis ) has discovered gold below the little town . At the ending takes places an exciting showdown in Leone style and under Morricone backdrop musical score .\n\nThis entertaining , engaging movie is crammed of fist-fights, punches , kicks, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of humor . Bud Spencer is top-notch as one army man taking on a group of bandits and as always he makes his own stunts with comic touches , as usual . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frenetic fight-sequences make up for it . It&apos;s an amusing romp plenty of brawls , including amusing bounds and leaps . This is a nice and funny juvenile story for Bud Spencer fans , as he&apos;s delight and likable . It packs action, fist-play, slapdash, humor with tongue-in-cheek and is quite bemusing . This release has some cool and several hilarious moments ; however the Terence Hill-Bud Spencer duo films are much better . The film isn&apos;t always good , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions , it&apos;s frankly delicious. The movie displays innumerable laughters , jokes and slapstick . In the picture appears ordinary secondaries from B Italian series seen in several genres as Spaghetti Western and Peplum as Giovanni Cianfriglia , Roberto Dell&apos;Acqua ,Octaviano Dell&apos;Acqua , Nazzareno Zamperla , Romano Puppo and Riccardo Pizzuti who&apos;s usual in Hill-Spencer movies . Acceptable cinematography filmed on location in Incir De Paolis, Rome, Lazio, Italy and Poblado del Oeste,Tabernas, Almería, Andalucía, Spain . Very good musical score by the classic Ennio Morricone in his usual Spaghetti style . The motion picture originally written by Sergio Donati , screenwriter of multiple Western , being middlingly directed by Michele Lupo who also directed ¨Bulldozer¨ and ¨Supersheriff¨ with similar protagonist and technicians . This is a passable entertaining juvenile that will appeal to Italian comedy buffs. In the 70s and 80s Bud Spencer starred various movies without Terence Hill , as he made three kind of films : 1ª he performed pictures with a little boy as partner as ¨Banana Joe ¨ , ¨Aladino¨and ¨The Supersheriff¨ ; 2ª about cop named Flatfoot or Rizzo, also called Piedone, such as, ¨Flatfoot in Cairo , Flatfoot in Hong Kong, Flatfoot in Egypt , Flatfoot in Africa¨, furthermore the ¨Extralargo¨ series 3ª about diverse characters as a medieval knight as ¨Soldier of fortune¨ , a swindler as ¨Mr Charleston¨ or a fisherman , ex-player as ¨Bulldozer¨ and an outlaw in this one. Rating : Average , only for Bud Spencer fans",

Winders set up a camera in a hotel room and he&apos;d ask various directors to come in and say what they thought about the future of cinema. Werner Herzog, Steven Spielberg, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Godard, Paul Morrissey and various others take part and offer their thoughts on the subject. The opinions very from Herzog not fearing the future to Spielberg showing high concern over the budgets of big movies, which are forcing studios to cut back on smaller films. It&apos;s funny because he speaks of being worried about the $10 million it took to film E.T., which he says could cost $18 million in a few years. It&apos;s also interesting to hear Herzog &quot;predict&quot; that one day you might be able to order movies through a computer or television. There&apos;s nothing technically good about this 45-minute film but it&apos;s interesting none the less."

      "reviewBody": "Disorder is very much like some of the other, more noteworthy, Italian dramas being made in the early 1960&apos;s. The plot is a loose series of bad parties and depressed states held together by an observer (in this case an unemployed waiter). La Dolce Vita and La Notte would both be fair comparisons. Disorder feels more like a cash-in, an attempt to exploit the foreign public&apos;s then fascination with the soulless lives of the Italian decadent. Like the journalist in La Dolce Vita, the main character of Disorder is not part of this world. Unlike The Fellini film, Disorder does give a fair amount of time to this outsider&apos;s problems (unemployment, a sick mother). Of course, the outsider&apos;s life is just as miserable as the well-to-do characters in the film.\n\nDisorder, which screened on 16mm as part of a campus film series this summer, is a mostly forgotten movie with a poor reputation. A certain falseness hangs over the film, which thinks it&apos;s more meaningful than it is. Still, the film has its strengths as well. The black and white cinematography is nice to look at. The photography is particularly striking in the moody first vignette where a dying man&apos;s son insists on throwing a nighttime party. There is evocative use of fog and darkness during and after the party. The actors do a good job as a whole, with only Alida Valli maybe going too far (a difficult role). I would single out the usually reliable Louis Jourdan, here playing a downtrodden man whose love has left him, for the highest acting honors. In addition, I also liked Susan Strasberg as an unloved daughter trying to prove her devotion by taking care of her dying father. Finally, the lovely Antonella Lualdi has the striking face one associates with this kind of upper-class heartache. I only wonder what her character, who could have nearly any man, would see in the jerk she was married to (played by Jean Sorrel). \n\nTo sum up, Disorder is no lost masterpiece. It is not a film that I would recommend anyone tracking down or petitioning Criterion to bring out on disk. However, for what it&apos;s worth, Disorder did reasonably hold my interest.",

      "reviewBody": "Just released on DVD, Gianni Amelio&apos;s 1998 film The Way We Laughed is a heartfelt chronicle of the fortunes of two brothers over a six-year period in postwar Italy that parallels the growth of the country from an agricultural to an urbanized, industrial society. Winner of the Grand Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival, the film derives its title from its constant reference to old-fashioned jokes on the back page of an Italian magazine from the fifties. Though I do not feel it is quite on the same level as Amelio&apos;s earlier work (L&apos;America, Stolen Children), The Way We Laughed is a soulful and captivating film that evokes a world little remembered except in the great Italian neo-realism films from the 40s and 50s. But the film is far from being a historical or political drama. As Sokurov explored the complex relationships between mothers and fathers and their sons in his Russian films, Amelio investigates the bond between brothers and the issues that result from self-sacrifice in a close-knit Italian family. \n\nThe film is separated into six parts labeled &quot;Arrivals,&quot; &quot;Deceptions,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; &quot;Letters,&quot; &quot;Blood&quot; and &quot;Families&quot;, each taking place on one day during the period from 1958 to 1964. While this technique allows us to understand the events taking place in Italy during this period, the sudden changes in the lives of the characters is difficult to follow and we are left having to put the pieces of the puzzle together on our own. As the film opens, Giovanni (Enrico Lo Verso), a poor illiterate worker arrives from Sicily to visit his teenage brother Pietro (Francesco Giuffrida) in the industrial north of Italy who is studying to become a teacher.  Determined that his brother Pietro will get a good education, he decides to remain in Turin to support him. \n\nIt is clear from the outset that all is not well with Pietro. He hides behind a pillar at the train station rather than meeting his brother, then goes out of way to help a Sicilan family who are lost until he finally gives up in disgust. He is very handsome but there is a haunted look in his eyes and it is never clear what his secrets are. Giovanni, magnificently portrayed by Lo Verso, is quite different. He is a giving person -- open and warm hearted. He sacrifices for Pietro, working low paying menial jobs but the younger brother seems unmotivated and does not take studying very seriously. Their love is not at issue, but each has an idealized picture of the other and they never fully come to grips with each other&apos;s reality.\n\nAs the years go by, Giovanni begins to move up the economic ladder and becomes a low-level Supervisor, then the boss of a cooperative. Pietro meanwhile has gone to a private teacher and has received his degree. The brothers remain close but when Pietro witnesses Giovanni getting into a fight with a presumed underworld figure, the consequences that result from self-sacrifice and the betrayal of morality are explored in a powerful conclusion. Like Giovanni&apos;s rise to a position of power through suggested shady dealings, The Way We Laughed seems to be saying that as modern Western societies have become rich, they have arrogantly forgotten the values it took them to get there.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m considering this Italian film as a &quot;first viewing,&quot; but this may have been one of the very first movies I ever saw in a theater when I was 4, I can&apos;t recall exactly. I know I definitely remember as a child seeing a rather grim TV commercial for it where a sad and solemn Santa Claus says: &quot;Christmas isn&apos;t coming this year&quot;, and it stuck with me ever since. I&apos;ve been meaning to track it down for years and I finally did, better late than never.\n\nWhen I was a kid there was a fun TV show called &quot;Birthday House&quot;, and its host was Paul Tripp. Well, Tripp wrote the screenplay for this film and stars in it as a good-spirited and kindly man who gets a visit from Santa Claus himself (Alberto Rabagliati) one year. Poor Santa&apos;s heartbroken because his mean landlord up at the North Pole (Rossano Brazzi - who also directed) is a tightwad who wants his back rent by Christmas Eve, otherwise Santa will get evicted and have to cancel Christmas. Since Santa doesn&apos;t have the money, he and Tripp get jobs to try and raise the cash (since Paul Tripp&apos;s profession in the film is a lawyer I don&apos;t understand that, but whatever). But it&apos;s also up to the kids to help Santa out for a change, as old St. Nick gets back some generosity himself this time.\n\nThis movie&apos;s got a pretty unflattering reputation. First off, it plays a little strange (well, to U.S. audiences, I mean) because this is an Italian production with sometimes plastic-looking effects, and dubbed into English. There are also pot shots taken against the actors, but I thought the cast was pretty well chosen... Paul Tripp makes for a really likable leading do-gooder, and Rabagliati as Santa Claus looks the part. Yet it&apos;s director Brazzi who steals the show as a really villainous ogre who hates Christmas and despises all children (we eventually learn why, in an ending that&apos;s actually pretty touching). This isn&apos;t a good film, but I found it had enough holiday spirit to probably merit repeat viewings every year. It&apos;s also a musical, meaning there a quite a few songs, only a couple of which are somewhat memorable. **1/2 out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "Artsy Musings are what inhabits this &quot;Selfie&quot; Film, Filmed in Black and White (of course). Sterility is Everywhere as is that Oldie but Goodie, Sex. These &quot;Techies&quot; and Nerds, no matter how Outrageous Their Hairstyles or Wardrobe, are still just like Everyone Else.\n\nMultitasking can&apos;t Mask the Fact that Mostly on the Mind is a &quot;Bit of the ole&apos; in and out.&quot; It all comes down to that when all&apos;s Said and Done. The Movie is Obsessed with the Thing. Just like the Past Generations of Young People these People try so hard to Distance Themselves.\n\nIt&apos;s all Slick Surface, Shiny and Reflective. Even the City Streets seem to have been Vacuumed of the Vile Stench and Debris. Everyone in the Picture is Perfectly Coiffed, Manicured, and ready for Their Inumerous Close-Ups.\n\nEven though the Story is about High-Tech and things that &quot;Everyday People&quot; find Frighteningly Frustrating, it somehow seems Mundane. The Commercial Shoot, the Yoga Classes, and Board Room Meetings contain Dialog that might well be in a Foreign Language, it&apos;s Numbed Down for the Masses. \n\nYou might Try Hard, in vain, to Understand anything Reggie Watts or the Yoga Instructor is saying in Their Extended Dialog Scenes. It all makes about as much Sense as an Acid Trip.\n\nSpeaking of Drugs, there are Plenty Consumed. In almost Every Scene something is being Smoked, Snorted, Popped, and Drank. Party On. \n\nThe Virtual Reality of the &quot;Augmenta&quot; Glasses is, of course, just like a Drug as Our Protagonist (Writer-Director-Actor, Multitasker, Benjamin Dickinson) gets so &quot;Turned On&quot; by wearing the &quot;X-Ray Specs&quot; that at times He can&apos;t separate the Experience from Reality (big surprise).\n\nOverall, this Indie is Worth a Watch for the Artsy Way it Displays its rather Pedestrian Postmodern Philosophy, but in the End, there really isn&apos;t Anything Post-Modern about it. It just Appears so, Dressed-Up in Hip Garb and Hairstyles.",

      "name": "Sensational neo-realist film with a moment of great surrealism",
      "reviewBody": "After his exile from his native Spain, director Luis Bunuel moved to Mexico in 1946, gaining citizenship in 1949. It was here where he would make his more generic films (by his standards), as he honed his own directorial skill while never straying too far from his surrealistic background. After the success of his comedy The Great Madcap (1949), he was commissioned by producer Oscar Dancigers to make a serious film about child poverty in Mexico City, and out of it came Los Olvidados, or The Young and the Innocent, to give it it&apos;s American title. Bunuel apparently spent months disguised as a homeless amongst the poverty- stricken children of the slums in order to research, and if that tale is true, it certainly came off, as Los Olvidados is one of the best and most realistic depictions of the innocent turning to crime in a fit of desperation.\n\nThe film follows three children in the same slum. Pedro (Alfonso Mejia) is a young tearaway who wants to change his ways and work, in order to help out his mother who neglects him due to her constant work. &apos;Little Eyes&apos; (Mario Ramirez) has been abandoned by his father, and is adopted by the blind beggar Don Carmelo (Miguel Inclan), a bitter man who frequently voices his opinions on the young criminals of the city. El Jaibo (Robert Cobo) has just been released from prison and immediately sets about gaining revenge of the boy he thinks ratted him out. Jaibo and Pedro corner the boy, only for Jaibo to bludgeon him to death, and the two boys flee. Pedro struggles to keep himself out of trouble and leaves home after being accused of stealing a knife, only to find his and Jaibo&apos;s paths repeatedly crossing.\n\nAt its heart, this is pure neo-realism, sharing its tone most obviously with Vittorio de Sica&apos;s masterpiece The Bicycle Thieves (1948) in exposing poverty and class divide as the main cause of criminality, due to the ill education and the hopelessness of the young. Although, out of nowhere, comes a surrealistic dream sequence so beautiful, and so haunting, that you know you&apos;re watching Bunuel, and his artistic creativity seems to bulge from the screen. Best known for his mocking of the upper-classes (the bourgeois were clearly as fascinating to Bunuel as they were repugnant), here he stays in the slums, promoting as much sympathy for its filthy lead characters as hatred.\n\nJaibo is a true monster, raised without parents, he bullies his way through life, grasping any opportunity that presents itself (he even manages to seduce Pedro&apos;s lonely and overworked mother, and rob a legless man). It is Pedro who is the beating heart of the film, especially when he leaves home and we witness the state of the lower- classes from his eyes and how they are viewed (in one powerful sequence, an upper class man obviously propositions him for sex, but we only see their exchange, as we watch them through a window). Bunuel then manages to deliver not one, but two sensational endings, that manage to move and shock as much as the famous and upsetting climax to Bicycle Thieves. Bunuel would go to France to create his greatest works, but Los Olvidados displays many of the attributes that made Bunuel one of the most important directors in the history of film, as well as being a great film in its own right.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "While the eighties was rife with weird sci-fi films and epic films, a simple and biting film about alien visitation made a nice little landing in 1988. Alien Nation was one of those films that expertly grasped the the sci-fi/mystery sub genre with a decent story and good visuals.\n\nThe casting in the film was rather perfect, with the subdued Mandy Patinkin playing Francisco while the normally hotheaded James Caan got his licks as a racist cop named Sykes. Either way, their polar opposites worked perfectly in the film, showing a growing bond between the two as they shook off their differences and made a rather capable team. What I especially liked was how each player sincerely became their character, which is something that is pretty rare in many sci-fi films. While I do wish the movie was a little longer and put some more scenes of George integrating into his new position at the beginning, the film was good as it was.\n\nAlien Nation proved to be one of the last good non-CGI sci-fi films. While Gattica is one of the few films that followed this ideal, at least we can look back at the genre before it became nothing more than an excuse to show off pretty effects.",

Urmila looks natural. BGM simply superb. best in 90&apos;s and made a way for many such movies.u don&apos;t get the feeling you are watching a movie, u just feel like its happening in front of us in real.later RGV made Satya movie with almost the same script which was super hit. ANTHAM movies many scenes and dialogs were seen in many movies .ex in POKIRI interval scene which heroin speaks to hero. overall ANTHAM movie is a classic in Telugu film industry. For me guys who are bored with routine Telugu movies must watch it",

      "reviewBody": "Black Cat 2, although a sequel from Black Cat 1, took quite a different turn in terms of the plot and the role of the main character in the film. In this sequel, Erica, the high-tech CIA agent, was once again activated by the government, this time to help track the killers of the Russian president. The film started with a scene where a group of doctors were performing a surgery to Erica. Then, it switched to a scene where Robin and his colleagues were protecting a Russian witness, then attacked by the terrorists, mixed with a good chasing scene on the snowy mountain, with exciting ski and snowboarding skills. Robin, another CIA agent, was assigned to partner up with Erica on this task to track down the killers. Unwillingly at first, Robin throughout the film, slowly developed sympathy to her and protested on the many experiments performed to her merely as a machine. Unfortunately, Jade Leung&apos;s performance as Erica in this sequel was not as convincing as expected. On the other hand, Robin Shou delivered a good, solid performance as Robin. Somehow, his strong character had overshadowed Erica&apos;s supposedly main role here. The ending was not conclusive. The scenes took place in USA and USSR. Sometimes it was funny to picture the film dubbed in Cantonese, especially during the conversation among the American officials.",

There is no right side, no good guys in white hats vs bad guys in black hats, it&apos;s way more complex than that.\n\nBut the story is not good. The characters are one dimensional. The events are too contrived. The whole thing is theatrical rather than cinematic - it&apos;s filled with overacting (acting and speaking for the last row rather than the lens), music, a tool of the filmmaker, is barely used, the story explains that war is complex and multi-dimensional, but our characters are simple and one-dimensional, almost clichéd. The cinematography is poor. There are very few (if any) establishing shots, the whole thing is brown, grey, muddy. Indoors, outdoors, it&apos;s all the same. There are no interesting camera tricks, moves or anything of modern &quot;film&quot; whatsoever. \n\nThe script is not interesting enough to be read as a screenplay, so why make a movie out of this? The lines let the actors down, who did nothing to save this film. With music playing no part and the camera doing the very minimum and nothing more, there&apos;s very little value in this film.\n\nThe jokes are few and far between, not enough to keep you laughing. It&apos;s also not absurd enough to hit that absurdic bone, unlike Apocalypse Now or Pretty Village Pretty Flame.\n\nThe production is quite poor, more like Yugoslav films of the 80s than something made in 2008.\n\nThe story is about a group of stage actors who go a war zone and discover that war zones are dangerous and terrible places to be. That&apos;s the synopsis and there&apos;s nothing to spoil because that&apos;s the whole film.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend it to anyone.",

      "reviewBody": "Bob (Regis Toomey) works for the Border Patrol. His nemesis is Zorro...a Mexican smuggler who keeps evading him. Now here is where it gets stupid. Bob cannot meet his sister when she arrives by train to visit him, so he leaves her in the care of his dog, Rinty (Rin Tin Tin Jr.). Soon Zorro arrives at Bob&apos;s cabin and the sister and Rinty are there....and Zorro kills the sister as Rinty attacks and tries to save her. When Bob returns, he&apos;s mad at the dog and throws him out...blaming the pooch for his sister&apos;s death. Now, Bob COULD have blamed Zorro or himself since he wasn&apos;t there to protect her. Instead, he treats man&apos;s best friend like dirt....what a jerk!!\n\nSoon after, Bob quits the service in order to devote his time to finding Zorro...which really doesn&apos;t make a lot of since when you think about it. After all, he was a Border agent and you&apos;d THINK some of the crooks in Zorro&apos;s gang would recognize him. Add this to the abominable way he treats his doggy, you can see why Rin Tin Tin Jr. Was billed above Regis Toomey when the film began!!\n\nAlthough the other two reviewers really liked the film, I thought it was a pretty typical B-movie and nothing more. Sure, the dog is cute....and that&apos;s really the only thing I thought the movie had going for it. Otherwise, it&apos;s passable entertainment and nothing more.",

      "name": "Fascinating farewell to film by the great Rex Ingram.",
      "reviewBody": "This was the final film, and only talkie, of one of the great visual stylists of the silent era.  It is a flawed work, but its virtues far outweigh its short-comings.  Like Pasolini many years later with ARABIAN NIGHTS, Ingram chose to film on real Arabian locations and with a largely unprofessional cast.  Both of these things were virtually unheard of in film-making at this time.  Both give the film a greater authenticity than a studio bound Hollywood fantasy like MOROCCO.  The location photography is sublime, and the real scenery extraordinary in its beauty.  If the non-professional actors are sometimes a little self-conscious, the magnificence of their faces makes up for it.\n\nBut it is the overly ambitious nature of the work that is its major short-coming.  While Hollywood was making its early talkies safely indoors, where the primitive sound recording equipment could cope more easily, Ingram wanted to give his first talkie the grandeur of a silent epic.  In the spectacular climactic battle sequence literally hundreds of extras fill the screen, but the sound recording does not match the images.  The sound effects are weak and ineffectual - crowd noise, gun-fire etc are all unconvincing.  As a result the scene is totally unbelievable and even unintentionally funny.  You really wish he had just shot it silent and added only music later.\n\nThe professional members of the cast are all terrific.  ROSITA GARCIA has real presence and an unusual beauty, and PIERRE BATCHEFF is really splendid as the young sheik.  His striking resemblance to Ingram&apos;s favorite leading man RAMON NOVARRO is hard to miss.  Batcheff apparently committed suicide shortly after this film was completed - I would like to know more about this truly charismatic actor.  REX INGRAM himself plays the second lead, and he is very good.  Perhaps less appealing is ARABELLA FIELDS as the &quot;mammy&quot; style black nanny.  As this was her only film I suspect she was a non-professional.  Her attempts at comic relief often fall flat.\n\nAs a final film of a master of cinema this is essential viewing.  It should be mentioned too that Ingram&apos;s wife and artistic collaborator ALICE TERRY is credited as co-director, and that this was also her final film.  One can only speculate what new ground Ingram and Terry may have broken had ill health, and a refusal to work in the Hollywood system, not prevented them from working again.  In the last moments of the film Ingram is seen waving toward the camera - it adds a sad poignancy to BAROUD.",

What I appreciate it how much his documentaries vary in subject matter, this man has a wide spectrum of interests and that keeps things fresh.\n\nCave of Forgotten Dreams has a very interesting subject matter and as always he tells a remarkable story, however the biggest flaw to it is simply that the subject matter didn&apos;t warrant 90 minutes. This would have made for a fantastic 20 minute short film, stretching it out to this extent with a lot of filler footage and extended interviews with people providing little more than speculation is not entertaining.\n\nI enjoyed Cave of Forgotten Dreams for what it is, but it&apos;s simply too long and what it brings to the table is as a result watered down.\n\nRants\n\nYou know one thing I do love about Herzog&apos;s documentaries (Or at least the ones I&apos;ve seen)? No agenda. An alarmingly high percentage of documentaries these days aren&apos;t telling you about something, they&apos;re telling you what to think about it. Much like the news, they don&apos;t report it anymore and leave the opinions to yourself they hit you with their opinions. I hate the words agenda and propaganda as people use them incorrectly and use them to describe anything that doesn&apos;t suit their narrative. Sadly however, some things emphatically undeniably are and I&apos;m so very tired of it.\n\nBreakdown\n\nWell made I always enjoy Herzog&apos;s narration Considerably too long Interviews could have been better.",

      "reviewBody": "As a former teacher, I see a lot of useful information from this movie. It shows many stereotypes that you see in everyday classrooms and schools: absent minded principals, matronly secretaries that truly run the school, highly idealistic teachers that have burned out, paper-hogs like Ditto and buttinski superintendents that won&apos;t let school progress like it should. For the comment by another poster about Ditto being absurd, not so fast my friend. I did my student teaching with a real life Ditto. That&apos;s all he had his students do and that&apos;s all he would let me do. These teachers do exist. Are they good? No, but they do still exist. I agree with many here that say it could be a good teaching tool for aspiring educators. I also think, today&apos;s educational institutions that prepare teachers would be too afraid to show it to prospective teachers because they are trying to make the &quot;perfect&quot; teacher. I think this would be a good example of showing different stereotypes of teachers that we saw in school and how to keep from falling into one of those holes as educators.",

      "reviewBody": "I really was expecting a &quot;skin flick&quot; based on its lobby cards when I first saw this film adaptation of Jean Genet&apos;s &quot;The Balcony&quot; in the summer of 1963, but I was definitely in for an awakening -- rude perhaps but definitely an awakening.\n\nI recommended the film to the owner of Gainesville, Florida&apos;s independent movie theater based on the original road show I had seen; however, I had to eat my words when he was only able to book the bowdlerized version that was available for distribution only a few short months after the film&apos;s original release. Perhaps too many people had been lured into theaters by the lobby card promise of a &quot;skin flick&quot; and were upset when they were greeted with a film that actually made the audience think for a change.\n\nI rented the DVD today and watched the uncut version of &quot;The Balcony&quot; for the first time since that original viewing some 43 years ago. I took notice of the grainy stock footage used in most of the exterior scenes and compared them with the crisp images of the interior of the TV studio sound-stage, Madame Irma&apos;s house of illusions, and I wondered if this might not have been deliberate -- reality is actually grainy and slightly out of focus while our fantasy world is crisply delineated but still patently phony as when Peter Falk as George, the Chief of Police, breaks through the kraft-paper door or when the rocks -- in the Leonard Nimoy as Roger fantasy -- oscillate when touched.\n\nShelley Winters was ideal as Irma; I cannot think of another actress working in 1963 who could have done better in the part. The rest of the cast was also exceptional.\n\nOne note concerning another comment about Peter Falk&apos;s accent being Southern and German -- surely this was said in jest? Falk&apos;s accent was a combination of his native New York accent and a put-on Latin American/Spanish accent if it was anything. Again, that mixture of accents was in keeping with the part and with the fantasy.\n\n&quot;The Balcony&quot; was definitely worth watching again some 43 years after I saw it during its first run. Will I still think so if I watch it after another 43 year interim? I think I probably will. . . .",

Yet each comedian that tells it has their own variation on the middle. And that&apos;s where the freedom (and generally the vulgarity) comes in.\n\nMy favorite renditions are by Kevin Pollak (doing a spot-on impression of Christopher Walken), Bob Saget, and Paul Reiser. Matt Stone and Trey Parker even animated a South Park version of the joke that had me laughing so hard I couldn&apos;t breathe.\n\nPaul Provenza and Penn Jillette filmed the movie over a period of 4 years and between 80 to 100 hours of DV video tape.\n\nThe film has been picked up for distribution by ThinkFilm. But don&apos;t be surprised if the MPAA slaps a NC-17 on the film for the language. Save your surprise for the theater."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Atlantic City&quot; is overall a well done film that&apos;s pays homage to the city itself and is somewhat a going away present for legendary Burt Lancaster. The film seems low key though even though drama is present it&apos;s not your typical gangster film of blood and violence and the plot is pretty simple and not to complex. Burt Lancaster is aging mobster Lou Pascal who takes care of an aging woman in fact a deceased mobsters wife, yet Lou is still in the business and collects at random on the boardwalk. Then enter Sally Matthews(Susan Sarandon) a waitress and card dealer in training for one of the casinos has her life turned up when her sister and ex show up from Philadelphia after finding a big bag of white powder! The paths of all the characters cross, yet as I said again it&apos;s mostly low key most important the relationship of escape routes develop for the lives of both Lou and Sally upon meeting. And the scenes of seeing Susan Sarandon wash and bath by rubbing lemon juice from squeezed lemons was very sexy! Clearly one of the more erotic memories in cinema history. Louis Malle wrapped it up well by being low key ending with both male and female lead characters getting what they wanted escaping to a new life. The scenes of A.C. was great and to top it all off Burt Lancaster was very classy and smooth in his performance.",

      "reviewBody": "You never know what you are going to get. With From Paris with Love, you see two distinctly different marketing strategies. One set of trailers and TV spot bills it as a hard-boiled action flick, with Travolta unleashing a fury of bullets. The other focuses on the much lesser known Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as he deals with the comedic situations placed on him through the Travolta character. If you can go in with an open mind, you&apos;ll see that both approaches ring true for better or worse.\n\nOur story starts with a long dose of James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). He&apos;s the personal aid to the U.S Ambassador to France. Known for book smarts, his side task of spying for his country affords him the opportunity to place bugs and switch plates. At his flat, his girlfriend Caroline (Kasia Smutniak) has to deal with being kept in the dark. When the opportunity for more dangerous work presents itself, Reece is given a partner in the form of Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Wax is a fast-talking, trigger-happy, manic whose order to do as he pleases may just be too much for Reece.\n\nThe two J&apos;s make for a great team. On one end you have Reece leading the audience into the underground world of mayhem while trying to keep his wits about him. On the other there is the everyman&apos;s adrenaline junkie who may not be too old just yet. And for what it&apos;s worth, in a throwaway action flick, there&apos;s a genuine sense of fun in the air. However, the emphasis on mindless chaos puts a damper on the mood. There are numerous moments where the pace hiccups all the way to 11. I sure would have appreciated a briefing of sorts instead of a simple kill everyone mentality. Even with the agenda to smite the terrorists, there is an explosive moment near the end that exists for zero narrative purpose. Maybe Wax was having so much fun flirting with diegetic sound that he forgot to fire his bazooka, opting instead to save it for a more dramatic moment. You just can&apos;t have the kill happy hero abort and purse a target at the same time.\n\nFrom the director of Taken, Pierre Morel, comes a tale based on a short story from Luc Besson. I&apos;m not sure what that&apos;s going to mean to the average moviegoer, whether you factor in Morel&apos;s short resume at the helm or the sporadic nature of Besson&apos;s screenplays. What I saw from a crew standpoint was a throwback to the &apos;80s and &apos;90s action genre. Gun use doesn&apos;t provoke bullet-time effects. You can bet Travolta has a stunt double. Most importantly you can understand what&apos;s happening during the fights. I can&apos;t even count how many films edit around the action these days to the point that you have no honest idea of who&apos;s still standing. If you are sick of The Dark Knight method of shooting fists juxtaposed with fallen bodies, From Paris with Love will be a good movie for you.\n\nWax is a character that is unfortunately placed in the narrative&apos;s backseat. To better understand what I&apos;m talking about, look at Lethal Weapon. In that film the two cop buddies have a developed background. We see their homes, we see Murtaugh&apos;s family and Riggs&apos; dog. Well in From Paris with Love the only character you get to know the history of or see the private love of is Reece. At 92 minutes, there certainly could have been time allotted to explore Wax, but the screenplay shuns it. Maybe some time to cool down with his side of life would have helped reduce the jerky pacing. Man, I feel the love for you Paris but I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;m getting it back.",

      "reviewBody": "A small-scale imposter / con man, making the rounds in 1950s New York, gets caught up in something much greater than his usual scam and decides to let it ride, if just to see where he winds up. In this case the answer is Italy, gorgeous vestige of the old world with just a few hints of the modern one, where he&apos;s tasked with convincing a flippant trust funder to return from a perpetual, fortune-draining holiday. That mission quickly goes by the wayside, just as soon as he realizes how much easier life is in the lap of luxury, and he merely exacerbates said money-letting as the wealthy playboy&apos;s new wingman. When things take a turn for the messy, though, his welcome worn thin and nothing to show for it but bittersweet memories, a panicked string of responses sends the entire comfortable lifestyle into a tailspin. At its root, Ripley is an example of how fear and rejection can press a normally smart, affable person over the brink into monstrosity, a surprise considering the playful tone of the first act. Matt Damon, still fresh from his breakout in 1997&apos;s Good Will Hunting, shows great versatility in the leading role (essential for such a complicated character), smoothly masking that twitch in his eye from all but the viewing audience. It&apos;s one of those films where you&apos;ll feel wrong about your rooting interest, knowing all along that the guy absolutely does not deserve a happy ending, with the final moments serving as your comeuppance.",

They are usually funny, selfishly misguided people, and Bateman fits the bill perfectly.\n\nThe Bad: Too much slapstick humor, had more potential, some scenes were unfocused and with no real purpose.",

      "reviewBody": "Strange little sequel filled with annoying characters and some horrible dialog. Poltergeist 3 is not really all that bad, it just suffers greatly from those two flaws. Story does wisely by switching the setting from the suburbs to the big city. The character Carol Anne now resides with her aunt and uncle and snobby cousin in Chicago, where they live in a high rise. Soon, ghosts start popping up again. This movie has some of the stupidest lines in it, it&apos;s often hard not to grin. O&apos;Rourke did a good acting job in the first two films. Here, not so good. I think that may be the fault of whoever wrote the go-nowhere script. A lot of the characters lines in this seem forced or overacted. Especially the character of Dr. Seaton. The special effects are impressive though. The makers used a lot of mirror tricks that really pull the movie through it&apos;s stupider moments. However, the chopped off head of Kane scene was atrocious. I guess this movie suffered because of severe budget cuts.A lot of scenes in this movie feel a bit lame(the kid who busts up through the ice and runs into the window, the &quot;break the mirror&quot; scene,the kid who flips off the security camera, etc., etc.). Nancy Allen, who plays the aunt, does not look happy to be involved in this. Weaker entry in the series, but it is watchable. Seems a bit rushed. Features annoying teenagers you would find in a Friday The 13th movie. A guy rips off Lara Flynn Boyle&apos;s cheek. And whats with that growling window pane in the end? Ya gotta see it if you saw the first two. Two stars."

Christian Slater was amazing as a very rare male romantic, and Mary Stuart Masterson was also endearing as his love interest.  \n\nThe only downfall was the trite script, but that was more than made up for by the wonderful acting, and the beautiful idea of the story.\n\n It makes you really think about what love is really all about.\n\nFor a wonderful romantic movie that gives you a reason to go out and look for that special someone, see Bed of Roses."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m always intrigued whenever a film director remakes his or her own work. What do they want to do differently this time? &apos;Der Onkel aus Amerika&apos; (&apos;The Uncle from America&apos;), directed by Carl Boese, is a remake of his 1931 film &apos;Man Braucht kein Geld&apos;. Each film gives an interesting depiction of Germany (and its relationship with the United States) at their respective moment in time: the 1931 version shows Germany on the brink of Nazism during the throes of Depression which was largely caused by American financiers, whilst the 1953 remake depicts post-war West Germany rising from the ashes (literally) under partitioning and U.S. military supervision.\n\nBoth films have nearly identical plots. In the remake, Thomas Hoffmann is a German expatriate who has reportedly made his fortune in America: now he is returning to his hometown for a visit. Schmidt is the head clerk at the local bank, which is on the brink of failure due to wartime problems and irresponsible speculation before and after the war. Schmidt believes that wealthy Hoffmann will invest in local industry (and deposit money in the bank) to save both the bank and the town. In the event, it turns out that Hoffmann is a failure and a fraud. Nevertheless, because Hoffmann is perceived to be rich, his mere presence attracts money: businessmen want to invest in his prosperous American businesses, unaware that those businesses are nonexistent. All is well until Hoffmann decides to turn honest and reveal the truth...\n\nGerman comedies usually manage to be unfunny, and this movie is meant to be a satire, which is even worse. The movie tries to make all sorts of clever comments about the United States, and big business, and German society, but most of these jokes fall flat. Still, this film is an interesting document of its time. I&apos;ll rate &apos;Der Onkel&apos; 3 points out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, &quot;I hope you like chicken. It&apos;s the only thing I know how to make,&quot; to which Kersey deftly responds, &quot;Chicken&apos;s good. I like chicken.&quot; If that&apos;s not English Grammar 101, I don&apos;t know what is.\n\nAnother thing about this Ms. Davis character: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him she wants to see him &quot;one last time&quot;(this being only the fourth time they&apos;ve ever met) before she moves to her sister&apos;s house in Binghamton,NY to get away from the creeps; then he really doesn&apos;t even bat an eye while her corpse is burning in the street only minutes later. Kersey never even says her first name through the entirety of the film. Not once. Never a &quot;Get over here, Katy,&quot; or a &quot;That&apos;s a nice dress you wearing, Kathryn&quot; or a &quot;Be careful, Katie, or the creeps&apos;ll get ya!&quot;\n\nAnd while this &apos;love&apos; is developing between the two, Fraker(Gavan O&apos;Herlihy) keeps his ever-watchful eyes on them. It&apos;s almost as if Kersey is using her as bait to get to Fraker, much as he uses the camera or the car. Sure enough, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites back hard...in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught on film! The final fifteen or so minutes are possibly rivaled only by the final thirty minutes of Delta Force in their brilliance. And that&apos;s giving Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other film can you see Ed Lauter take out Alex Winter in order to get Charles Bronson&apos;s back, a troubled gang leader seemingly calling a hotline to summon neo-nazi bikers to come to his aid, and nimble Broadway dancers wearing mesh halter-tops posing as street punks, all laid down to a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If that&apos;s not the highest of high comedy, then nothing is funny.\n\nTruthfully speaking, there are a thousand ways to state the unintentional comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to watch it and judge for yourself.",

Most of the blaxplotation boxes are ticked here, Shaft is super cool, the music is great, some of the lines are very funny, he gets the girls, the opening is great, the bad guys are mostly white gangsters with a lone black guy letting the side down, it&apos;s all there, but what this has that all others don&apos;t is the fantastic action-packed ending. As action sequences go this is one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen, it just goes on and on and I loved every second of it and it looks as if the director Mr Parks was given free control to do what ever her wanted and he really went for it. This could very likely be may favourite of the breed as along with &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, it&apos;s a fine example of what the series was capable of when everything slotted into place so well.",

      "reviewBody": "This is weird stuff! It&apos;s about a famous rock band from Quebec (French Canada), Offenbach, who was in France one year, in 1974. The filmaker shot them in day to day life, in a house were the guys lives and pratice their music. This is kind of direct cinema, with no script, no direction, no intentions. We see the musicians having a lot of fun with grass and beer, in a way that was very familiar to rock fans who were there in the 1970&apos;s.\n\nSometimes, lead singer Gerry Boulet gets bore with the constant presence of the camera. Drummer Wezo seems to do too much in front of it. At last, we, the spectators, are very very bored too. But, in many ways, this is an important document about the way of life of rock musicians in the 1970&apos;s, away from the stardom and\n\nlimousines. Very popular in Quebec, Offenbach was unknown in\n\nFrance. The live sequences are the best, but there are not many. We see the band rocks in very strange little places, like in a bar during a motorcycle race. We hear the band and the motorcycles! And there&apos;s fight betwen drunken French. The sequence where Boulet sings Edith Piaf classic L&apos;Hymne à l&apos;Amour is a must to see and hear! This is the true sense of soul and blues! I read that the band dislikes the experience of being stuck in this house with all these cameras all the times. They get angry with each other. About a year later, half of the band says goodbye and Offenbach will carry on with Boulet, Johnny Gravel and new musicians, while Lamothe, Wézo and Harel will form Corbeau. The soundtrack of this movie was a huge hit in Quebec at that time, but is now a very rare record ! Those were the days, you know...",

      "reviewBody": "There are several good Robin Hood movies, almost everybody who knows cinema would agree that 1938 &apos;The Adventures of Robin Hood&apos; with Errol Flynn is one of the best thus far, or perhaps even 1983 &apos;Robin Hood and the Sorcerer&apos; and 1922 silent film are also worth mentioning. Here we are with mid 1970s Russian version, and in my opinion it is worth watching. Lots of things go against this film - well, how easy was to create an authentic atmosphere of the medieval England in the 1970s Soviet Union. Not very easy at all. Historical authenticity aside, the treatment of a character is quite unusual. This Robin is almost Byronesque or rather a Lermontov type. The plot is a version of a familiar story, so not too many surprises there. All in all, the film to me always looked a bit weak with few brighter spots (e.g. evil knight casting and performance), but the songs of Vysotsky, are good songs. At times they fit well, and at times they are dissonant with what&apos;s on the screen, but no matter, they definitely add a dimension to the movie itself. There is something in the scenes very akin to Taganka theatrical mood of the time.\n\nThe first cinema release did not contain the songs, there were simply cut off, subsequently everything was restored, so if you come across the butchered version, it&apos;s not worth looking at.\n\nWhere is the release with the subtitles, you might want to ask? Once again - who knows. Yet another case of country&apos;s voluntary cultural isolation. And from what I&apos;ve observed, even in the most famous Russian or Soviet movies the quality of translation is unequivocally horrible, primitive, too approximate, certainly made by people not very well versed in both languages.",

The main problem with the film going past the halfway mark is that little of any real interest is happening, and nothing really stands out.

      "reviewBody": "Recently, Turner Classic Movies showed a bunch of films by Pierre Étaix--the first time they&apos;ve been seen in this country in decades. Because the films have been tied up in legal disputes, most Americans have no idea who Étaix is--and I was quite curious. So, I recorded them and have watched them over the last few weeks. &quot;The Suitor&quot; is the last of his films they showed--and so I have come to the conclusion that his films, for me, are only modestly funny. If you like the films of Jacques Tati (which I don&apos;t), then you&apos;ll probably like the droll films of Pierre Étaix.\n\nWhen the film begins, you see that Pierre is a nerdy guy who spends most of his times studying astronomy. His parents are concerned--he&apos;s getting older and should settle down and get married. The problem is that he is socially inept--though he is willing. Throughout much of the film, the character wanders about Paris--watching men picking up women and then he tries to imitate them. In every case, it&apos;s a disaster and I really, really liked the lipstick bit. However, some of the subplots went on WAY too long--particularly the obnoxious lady who laughs too loudly. Much of the film was very subtle and done much like a silent movie--but she didn&apos;t fit in at all. A little of her might have worked--using her as much as they did was, in my opinion, a mistake. She was funny but after a while she was just annoying--and NOT in a good way.\n\nFor me, this is a decent film but one that didn&apos;t excite me. However, it is important to note that many people LOVE Jacques Tati and Jerry Lewis--and these folks would probably love this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Action Western with lots of shots , gunplay , treason and realized in Spaghetti Western wake. Clips (Mimmo Palmara), a bounty killer, is after one John Coler (John Richardson) , who has fooled him , keeping all of a loot he should have shared with him . He finally catches his prey only to discover that the man is a Coler all right but not the expected one . He is actually the outlaw&apos;s upright younger brother Bill (John Richardson himself in a dual role), who works in a traveling circus along with a fatty colleague. And both of them set up a fake gunfight at a saloon in which both opponents are killed . They are two traveling entertainers offering a form of gun-play spectacle . Meanwhile , the bounty killer brother is mercilessly pursued by bounty hunters who are after the gold hidden by him . Being mistaken for his grey-haired and killer brother , the bandits to be able to find the stolen gold taking prisoner the good brother Bill , and the latter is submitted to cruel tortures until he get escaped .\n\nThis Spaghetti film packs action , shootouts , high body-count , go riding and high body-count . This so-so flick contains a story full of crosses as well as double-crosses , ups and downs pace , thrills and ordinary direction . Worthwhile seeing only for the strong and violent confrontation beetween the good and and bad brothers against the gang of vicious Mexican bandits . Weak acting by main starring John Richardson in a dual role , both as an outlaw who&apos;s been on the run, and his lookalike brother who&apos;s member of a circus troupe , being subsequently tortured by a horde of Mexican bandits . John Richardson&apos;s big success was Don Chaffey&apos;s One million years B. C. (1966) , produced by Hammer films , with Raquel Welch and in which he met his wife Martine Beswick . Later on , following the steps of some other actors , he went on to appear in various Italian movies , as he played 4 Spaghettis : Gringo, getta il fucile! , Johnny le bâtard, The Adventurer of Iguana, Execution (1968) and a number of films in regular Italain sub-gnrs as Euro-Spy , Gialli , Terror such as Torso (1972) , Frankenstein &apos;80 , Umberto Lenzi&apos;s horror Eyeball (1975), Michele Soavi&apos;s La Chiesa (1989) , Mario Bava&apos;s mask of the devil and many others ; but his recent movies filmed in the 80s convinced him to quit acting completely and , nowadays , he is a noteworthy photographer . Here appears ordinary secondaries and familiar faces from Spaghetti Western , such as : Mimmo Palmara as Dick Palmer as a nasty bounty hunter, Franco Giornelli, Piero Vida ,Lucio De Santis , and Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia.\n\nIt contains an attractive score with plenty of Spaghetti sounds by Coriolano Gori as Lallo Gori . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Aldo Scavarda , shot in Israel with a lot of mountainous landscapes that bear remarkable resemblance to Almeria, Spain. The motion picture was middlingly directed by Domenico Paolella, as it has some flaws, gaps and failures . He was a director and writer, known for filming all kind of genres such as Nunexploitation : ¨The nun and the devil¨, ¨Unholy Convent¨ , Peplum : ¨Maciste Nell&apos;inferno Di Gengis Khan¨, ¨Il Gladiatore Che Sfidò L&apos;Impero¨ , ¨Golia Conquista Di Bagdad¨ , ¨Ercole Contro Tiranni , ¨Maciste against Mongols¨, among others . Rating : 4/10 , very mediocre Macaroni Western.",

      "reviewBody": "Gummo is a nonlinear narrative centered around the residents of Xenia, Ohio. After a tornado devastated their town the surviving residents pass the time by any sadistic means possible. A long day of feral cat hunting ends with a brief discussion of crème brûlée before a session of glue huffing, followed by a visit to a local prostitute suffering from Down Syndrome. It&apos;s as if Deliverance and Apocalypse Now had a child, abused it, and left it to its own devices. Horrifying is a word that comes to mind when attempting to evaluate this film. Drunken chair-wrestling, random acts of molestation, and casual conversations ranging in topics from cat burnings to their general dislike of African Americans are pretty typical. The only thing more trash filled, filthy, and septic then their homes, is their gene pool. Life in rural Ohio has never seemed so nihilistic. Though disturbing, I found this to be a quietly beautiful film. Both hyper-real and utterly surreal, it&apos;s stylized aesthetic is perfectly suited for the subject and premise. Rich symbolism and unforgettable images demand ones attention in an unrelenting assault on the Status Que. Unsettling and humbling, we are given a glimpse of inbred Americana straddling the border of malignant sadism and total insanity. The story telling style of Harmony Korine reminds me of the work of Terrence Malick, with the addition of a little incest."

      "reviewBody": "ICE is one of the most attractive black-and-white achievements ever made, a remarkable film set in a totalitarian regime in the United states, that&apos;s centered in NYC. The episodic script revolves around an underground leftist organization as they plan guerrilla activities, imagining a mass urban insurrection in New York. They protest American influences in Mexico, deal with internal disputes, and eventually coordinate a major, city-wide, heavily armed offensive against the State.\n\nOften bizarre, dialogues act as a distorted segment of some philosophical discussion or move along absurd paths of a labyrinth from which there is no way out. Characters whose patterns of behaviour are unusual, the psyche is torn, emotions are pushed into the background, and some unexpected reactions quite understandably radiate coldness (and eventually come to a standstill), since they are completely separated from their environment. They are acted in Goddard&apos;s style, with occasional bursts of theatricality. What allows Robert Kramer to keep this (experimental) construction stable, and it becomes clear in the first few minutes, is the flawless and equally unconventional. Beautiful, fascinating, and ultimately inscrutable ICE is a film that haunts with its refusal to explain itself and is likely to reverberate in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. I recommend this to the fans of The Killing of America (1981), Peter Watkins Punishment Park (1971), Miklós Jancsó&apos;s Silence and Cry (1968), Haskell Wexler&apos;s Medium Cool (1969), Kazuo Hara&apos;s Extreme Private Eros: Love Song (1974), Gilles Groulx&apos;s The Cat in the Bag (1964), John Gianvito&apos;s The Mad Songs of Fernanda Hussein (2001), Memories of Underdevelopment (1968) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Vampires of Poverty (1977) directed by Carlos Mayolo &amp; Luis Ospina.",

      "reviewBody": "The Granddaddy of all soap operas, Peyton Place has its place in film and television history. When the steamy best seller by Grace Metalious and film by Jerry Wald and 20th Century Fox were converted into a television series, it set a standard for evening prime time soap operas that some will argue has never been equaled.\n\nTimes have surely changed. Set in New England as it is if Peyton Place existed it&apos;s now in the vanguard of blue state America. But in 1941 Peyton Place in New England would probably have enjoyed keeping cool with native son Calvin Coolidge and no doubt voted for Hoover, Landon, and Wilkie instead of that radical FDR in the White House.\n\nIn this prim and proper New England town it&apos;s all about keeping up appearances. Everybody knows everyone so if things aren&apos;t quite fitting the America of Norman Rockwell you keep them behind closed doors.\n\nLike Lana Turner never bothering to tell daughter Diane Varsi that she&apos;s an out of wedlock child, like poor Russ Tamblyn not being able to relate to the opposite sex in his teen years, like Hope Lange living with a brutal rampaging father in Arthur Kennedy who physically abuses her mother Betty Field and does more than that with her.\n\nLeon Ames as the town&apos;s employer, owner of the mill where most of the town works maybe the leading citizen, but the town&apos;s moral authority is Lloyd Nolan, a very wise and caring doctor, the kind of small town doctor who&apos;s a passing memory.\n\nIt&apos;s impossible to describe the plot of Peyton Place because there are so many strands in the plot fabric. It all works very well courtesy of screenwriter John Michael Hayes and director Mark Robson. The whole thing is narrated by Diane Varsi as Allison McKenzie who grew up and wrote a book about her home town.\n\nPeyton Place got nine Oscar nominations, but unfortunately lost a lot of awards it was up for to The Bridge On The River Kwai. Lana Turner&apos;s one and only nomination came in a year that the Academy voters gave the Best Actress Award to relative newcomer Joanne Woodward. Russ Tamblyn and Arthur Kennedy split the vote and Red Buttons won for Sayonara for Best Supporting Actor and the same thing happened with the Best Supporting Actress with Diane Varsi and Hope Lange splitting for Miyoshi Umeki to win for Sayonara as well.\n\nThe Code was still firmly in place and had it not been I think Russ Tamblyn&apos;s character would have been more explicitly gay. Here he&apos;s a timid young man not comfortable with the opposite sex and not real popular among his own heterosexist males. Then as now, gays are not real comfortable in most small towns.\n\nStill for those who like their big screen soap operas, you&apos;ll love Peyton Place, even with changing mores the film holds up well.",

The fault chiefly lies on Tashlin, who wrote and direct. He milks a gag endlessly, and there aren&apos;t very many humorous things in the movie in the first place. The music numbers consist of bad songs sung badly. Near the end of the movie, the movie looks like it went through some major editing, resulting in a number of things not explained or resolved. One good thing about the movie is the sets - they look lavish!\n\nI hear they are planning to remake this movie. Though I usually balk at remakes, at least here they are planning to remake a BAD movie - which means there is plenty of room for improvement."

Bryce acts as a perfect actor and a girl&apos;s real power is shown.Wrong impressions about the weakness of women have to be disappeared and this film may help those kind of thought&apos;s owners to change their ideas. After this film I am a fan of (not Steve&apos;s) Bryce&apos;s and expect many more films from him!..There must be more photos and movies of Bryce Johnson.This is the certain idea of my friends and mine. Although I prefer sci-fi films more than watching these kind of thrillers which include less action but the sense that makes us believe in the doubts is even enjoyable in some parts..",

      "reviewBody": "Seminal gangster film about the rise and fall of Enrico Bandello, a Chicago hoodlum, based on the novel by W.R. Burnett. The prototype for Enrico was, like so many other gangster heroes, mobster Al Capone. If you know a little bit about his life story, you got your basic gangster plot for practically all films that followed, like Tony Camonte in SCARFACE.\n\nThis film was the first of &quot;the big three&quot;, together with PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) and SCARFACE: SHAME OF THE NATION (1932) and provided the blueprint for the modern gangster crime flic. It was the first gangster film to reach a wide audience and launched Edward G. Robinson to stardom. The story is simple and straightforward and might feel a little overly familiar to modern audiences, but the film lost little of its power and still holds up pretty well. It&apos;s a tough movie, but mostly tough talking with not much violence on screen. \n\nBut the film would probably be instantly forgettable without Robinson&apos;s superb performance. Whenever he&apos;s on screen, his presence is incredibly menacing. The rest of the cast is so so, but Thomas Jackson as Flaherty, Rico&apos;s nemesis, gives a wonderfully cynical performance, mocking Rico and all the other gangsters. Like most other early gangster films, it lacks the real emotional depth and complexity that came with later films, like the French gangster films of the fifties or THE GODFATHER and was made primarily as popular entertainment. Pleasant entertainment nevertheless with Edward G. Robinson portraying the first classic gangster role in screen history.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 8/10"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Speed&quot; was a runaway success in 1994.  It was a block-buster in every sense of the word and critically speaking, it is an excellent motion picture.  The film deals with an LAPD swat officer (Keanu Reeves) who is playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with crazed ex-cop Dennis Hopper.  After Reeves stops Hopper from blowing up a high-rise building, the next obstacle is a city bus.  Hopper has rigged the bus to explode if the &quot;speed&quot; ever drops below 50 miles per hour.  Sandra Bullock, in her star-making role, plays an unlucky passenger who becomes the center of attention when she is forced to be the driver when the original navigator is accidently shot.  The great thing about &quot;Speed&quot; is the fact that it never tries to be more than it is. It goes for non-stop action, thrills, chills, and spills.  However, Dennis Hopper&apos;s character is somewhat complex and his performance probably should have garnered him an Oscar nomination.  A great film in spite of the fact it is from the action genre.  5 stars out of 5."

It isn&apos;t an adaptation of any one book of his, but rather of his writing as a whole. All the Kafka-esquire things you&apos;d expect are here: conspiracy, paranoia, mystery, and the like. What is so amazing that they come together absolutely fantastically. The cinematography is especially ingenious and really captures the mysterious and cryptic look and feel of a Kafka tale. The use of color and B&amp;W is pretty simple, but very effective. In fact the whole movie is pretty simple, there are no spectacular stunts or extraordinary set pieces, just a relentless, nail-biting, suspense as Kafka searches for answers to who murdered his friend. He receives help from a supposed rebel group who talks of a secret order and conspiracy that works from the confines of a mysterious looking building outside of town, but they are soon murdered...so Kafka goes to find the truth for himself. First-rate suspense all the way. 10/10\n\nRated PG-13: some violence and grim content",

      "reviewBody": "This is a terrific film, centered on the life of a family of Tunisian Jewish immigrants in the desolate Paris banlieue of Sarcelle (aka la Petite Jérusalem). We follow two stories : Laura (played by the ravishing Fanny Valette) is a 19 year-old philosophy student, committed to Kant and to rationalism in the midst of a pietistic household which, to put it mildly, does not share her enthusiasm for philosophy (as his pious sister remarks, philosophers take aim at their target and hit the bullseye : problem is, they&apos;re aiming at the wrong target). So taken is Laura by Kant that she imitates his daily promenade, every day at the same time...unlike Kant, however, Laura&apos;s stroll happens to lead her past the door of the darkly handsome Algerian clandestine immigrant alongside whom she works as a janitor in the evenings. The rest is not hard to predict, but Abdou&apos;s direction is always restrained, subtle, understated. There is never a moment in which here characters&apos; words or actions ring false. This is, by the way, one of the best portrayals of philosophy I have ever seen in a film : we often see Laura in her philosophy class, where a Derrida-lookalike prof discourses - rather eloquently - on freedom versus the law in Kant. This stuff actually *matters* to Laura, but the Law she is concerned with is, of course, the law of the Torah. Can freedom be reconciled with obeying the Law? That&apos;s Laura&apos;s dilemma, and Albou treats it with dignity yet without sententiousness.\n\nThe other main focus of the film is Laura&apos;s older sister Mathilde, played in an award- deserving performance by Elsa Zylberstein. Married with four children, she is deeply pious and sure of herself until she discovers her husband&apos;s been fooling around. Her only solace then is the ritual bath, and she seeks sexual advice from its wise attendant in order not to lose her husband. It would have been easy to treat this scene as slapstick, but instead it&apos;s done with the greatest respect for the characters involved : Mathilde, who is afraid of losing her modesty and giving way to the dark tendencies of her soul, is astonished to learn that yes, according to the Torah, she is in fact allowed to touch her husband&apos;s genitals. Watch also for the lovely scene where Mathilde asks for sexual advice from her mother (the excellent Sonia Tahar). Every dialog rings true, and the superstitious mother, who initially comes across as a domineering harpy, is revealed as a woman of depth and dignity : not because she evolves or &quot;sees the light&quot;, but just because we get to know her better.\n\nThis is a deeply humanist film, set against a background of the utmost contemporary relevance (a synagogue is burned and a group of soccer-playing Jews is attacked by a group of masked thugs ). It&apos;s impossible to come away from this film without a deeper understanding of, and therefore respect for, an entire aspect of Sephardic Jewish culture from a feminine point of view",

      "reviewBody": "The Sunday Disney early evening television show was a moment in most homes. Early fading memories of the original Disney film The Incredible Journey with my mother in the &apos;safer world &apos;for some that it was. Waxing nostalgia puts one in rose-coloured glasses yet it is a sheer delight to watch a new French-made A Cat&apos;s Life made for family viewing that illustrates moments of life in a non-heavy-handed way.\n\nThe story is simple yet profound in many ways as you have a young girl Clémence (Capucine Sainson-Fabresse) who rescues a kitten found in her Parisian attic. She names it Lou and throughout the film, they form an unbreakable sentimental bond. This bond is one through life that those who have animals in their home. The four-legged dependant quadrupeds become part of the family for years, seeing one through tough times, good times and life changes.\n\nLou like Clemence is timid, shy and in some ways naïve to what changes can happen rapidly. The family ventures to the countryside for a cottage vacation, where Lou&apos;s curiosity leads to life-changing adventures in the woods from a curious kitten to an adventurous cat much the same as Clemence who faces her parent&apos;s imminent divorce.\n\nThe city of Paris and the rural settings are lovingly photographed somewhat in the style of the Netflix series Emily in Paris. This is the backdrop of a personal voyage for all its characters, mainly through Lou&apos;s eyes. The French have a way of doing this style of live-action film earlier successes like The Bear and others with exquisite photography of the cats both large and small, Parisian drain gutters with rats and later the lush green forbidding forest. The picture also has little dialogue enhancing the storytelling with the images making it good for children.\n\nClémence and Lou both are in adolescence and the pursuit of independence. In many ways, this film shows often that Cats, adopt you. Lou&apos;s adventurous escapades and Clémence&apos;s evolving companionship needs particularly when her parents announce their divorce are both transition points to adulthood. A journey that one grows into sometimes at the price of a loss touching on a tough point that one never grows up until one buries a parent. A Cat&apos;s Life may seem a simple cuddle film yet there is more in play in the world of the film.\n\nAside from four-legged Lou and her friends who do steal the show in points, there is Corinne Masiero&apos;s portrayal of Madeleine, the secretive hermit artist who lives near the family&apos;s cottage property. Her role deepens the story with her role philosophical moments, talking to her dog Rambo as if he were human. She also coexists peacefully with nature with deep abiding respect for the cycle of life and Death that makes up the natural world. In one profound sequence Madeline reveals to Clemence that she has a hypodermic with the drug to put her Dog Rambo to sleep should his time come. She mentions it is cruel to keep animals alive for our Love and when it is Rambo&apos;s time she will do it with dignity. Madeline also is forced to kill a wild boar to save Clemence in the woods She is deeply distressed and angry about having to do this act laying her hands on the animal with reverence and regret.\n\nA Cat&apos;s Life is wonderful as a smaller version of themes from Born Free as it shows Humans and animals are not that far apart in some ways. People grow and change with time and so seek independence. Crafted with exquisite care with music and images the film is a narrative that is not just entertainment but a learning experience for some to choose to let yourself into the film world. Even the most hard-hearted unsentimental go through these moments in Life at one time. The reflections of love, loss, and deeper themes of growing up, and leaving bits of your past life even though it hurts deeply which we all do.",

The family, with six unruly children and additional extended family and friends, created a whirlwind of hijinks. The father (a well-known Spanish actor) dominated the screen, constantly responding to issues with their kids. The mother played a bit part and was very much a supporting actress. Oddly, neither parent seemed to have jobs or at least it wasn&apos;t clear what they did but that might have been lost in translation. The film, filled with silly and unbelievable scenarios, featured over-the-top performances and would suit fans of slapstick comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a film basically about crooked land trickery in the old west, specifically Texas in this case. Such activities historically were well documented for a time along the Rio Grande on the far south Texas border rather than so specifically the Pecos River area of Texas which was mostly just empty desert, but do form a footnote in the five hundred year history of the Spanish Colonial New World and its later ex-colonies the Republic of Mexico and Republic of Texas (later to merge into the U.S. and become a State). The colorful border atmosphere is somewhat captured in this otherwise routine western movie.\n\nEstablished star and real-life American hero George O&apos;Brien is strong in the lead role and young buck Tim Holt is an unpredictable and mercurial kid Ranger and they are both fine in their roles, ordinary as the roles may be. Veteran actors do good work in support.\n\nBut now the reason for my review of this movie: stunning young Rita Hayworth. Her beauty and screen presence jump off the screen. She has obviously got &quot;it&quot;. Her acting is forceful and her wardrobe ranges from pretty dresses to riding clothes that do not (or cannot) constrain certain parts of her upper torso. As a side note, I could mention that she does an impressive amount of her own horsemanship in this film. And if I was a rider in her vigilante justice group I would surely follow her to hell and back. Hayworth is a young actress giving a good performance here that sets her up for the launch of her soon to be mega-stardom, and deservedly so. \n\nOK, its only an ordinary b-western. But the film&apos;s three starring performers elevate it well above what it otherwise would be.",

As the doomed beauty , Anouk Aimee is perfect as the almost bland wife that unwillingly is slowly overwhelmed by her controlling husband. A tragic , but unfortunately true portrait of human defects left unchecked. The films&apos; overall feel and look of a haunted mind makes it compelling to watch , and immediately after-wards went to my computer to research the name of the &quot;european&apos; director. i was pleasantly surprised by Mr.Sidney Lumets&apos; name, and film.",

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t done this in a while, but for Star Pilot, I&apos;m going to use the plot summary from IMDb: &quot;Aliens from the constellation Hydra crash-land on the island of Sardinia. A prominent scientist, his daughter, several young technicians, and a pair of Oriental spies are taken hostage by the beings so they can use them to repair their spaceship&apos;s broken engine. With that done, they take off towards their home planet, taking the earthlings with them. However, the humans attempt to mutiny against their captors, inadvertently sending their tiny spaceship hurtling into the infinite beyond.&quot; \n\nI used the IMDb plot summary because, even after watching Star Pilot, I&apos;m not entirely sure what it was all about. The movie made very little sense to me. But even though I may have been confused during most of the movie, parts of it were still a lot of fun in a campy / cheesy sort of way. Instead of the usual write-up I do, here are a few random thoughts I have regarding Star Pilot:\n\n1. While the cast wasn&apos;t much to write home about, it&apos;s always cool seeing Kirk Morris and Gordon Mitchell outside a Sword and Sandal film. I just wish Mitchell had been in the film for more than 20 seconds. Other than getting his name in the credits, I&apos;m not really sure why the filmmakers even bothered.\n\n2. There&apos;s a decent size chunk of the film &quot;borrowed&quot; from Doomsday Machine. The differences in film quality, acting, and everything else is a little jarring. It&apos;s shocking just how good the stuff from Doomsday Machine looks in comparison. The clips include a scene with Casey Kasem - minus Kasem&apos;s very recognizable voice.\n\n3. Why bother with the Chinese secret agents? It adds absolutely nothing to the plot. It seems like such an unnecessary plot detail that amounts to nothing in the end.\n\n4. I suppose that if I had to pick a highlight, it would be actress Leontine May&apos;s ever-shrinking wardrobe. She begins the film fairly modestly dressed, but by the end, she&apos;s wearing a full body fishnet with a few strategically placed feathers. \n\nIn some ways, the 5/10 I&apos;ve given Star Pilot may not be fair. The copy I watched seemed to be horribly cut-up. IMDb lists a runtime of 89 minutes. The version I watched was only 81 minutes. I&apos;m not sure how much difference the extra 8 minutes would make, but I&apos;d certainly be up for giving it another go with a complete copy.",

As he grows, he looks different from the other penguins. Later, he mets Spanish - like penguins that are a hight light to the film because they add to the humor. As the story goes on, we learn there are less fish and the water is filled with garbage. Because of us humans, penguins are in danger.\n\nThe characters are all great and the animation is wonderful and very detailed. It is funny and it even has messages. It teaches us to accept who we are. It also tells us that the environment is in danger, but in a fun and entertaining way. This film beats Monster House and Cars as the best animated film of the year."

It features effective villains played by James Spader and Christopher Plummer. I&apos;ve always found Spader an easy guy to dislike, in any film.\n\nJack Nicholson is the lead guy, however, and is refreshingly low-key, especially for him. I don&apos;t believe he ever raised his voice in this movie, acting very subdued throughout.\n\nThere isn&apos;t as much action as you see in most modern-day horror movies but yet this is such an intense story that you don&apos;t lose interest. It&apos;s pretty good in the visual department, too, and it doesn&apos;t hurt to ogle Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nEven though the profanity is pretty low for a &apos;90s film, when it&apos;s there it&apos;s needless. They could could have done this movie, believe it or not, without any and it still would have been good. I&apos;m not complaining. I still recommend this, but not for people who are looking for an action--packed vampire film.",

      "reviewBody": "Beware of documentaries that value the producer&apos;s fantasies more highly than their commitment to accuracy! At least one INTENTIONAL error in this film makes me question the integrity of the entire thing. The live-action footage of the belly dancer completely misrepresents how the women at the Columbian Exposition would have dressed and danced in 1893. Although the vintage still photos ALL show the dancers wearing blouses, with their midriffs and upper arms covered, the modern-day footage shows the dancer with a completely bare midriff and a horrid enormous navel jewel.\n\nFor those who care, the bra as we know it was invented in 1913 (according to patents issued), and the &quot;jewel in the navel&quot; idiocy was invented by Hollywood after the Hayes Code was instituted in the 1930&apos;s. So why did the producer force these anachronisms into a documentary about an 1893 event? I am told that the dancer tried to push for wearing historically-correct costuming, but the producer, Mark Bussler, insisted on a &quot;1970&apos;s James Bond&quot; look. If Bussler knowingly insisted on a 1970&apos;s look for one of the elements of his &quot;documentary&quot; about 1893, what other inaccuracies did he knowingly insert into it? He completely destroyed the credibility of this entire project by depicting the dancer with a look that was 80 years out of context.\n\nFor a historically-accurate description of the dancers at the Columbian Exposition, don&apos;t view this documentary. Instead, see the book titled Looking for Little Egypt by Donna Carlton.",

Although it is a film worth watching, for River&apos;s performance if nothing else, its accredited greatness is no more than a wishfully constructed social myth.\n\nI wish I could say how truly remarkable the film is, but to be honest it lacks substance, it leaves you yearning for something moreI think much of the talent in the film is unexploited to its best potential and the dialogue, in its second half, written in a kind of impromptu, mock Shakespeare, is devoid of any magic.\n\nOverall the film is watch-able and has some great shots, like that at the beginning where the viewer joins Mike (River Phoenix) toward the end of a blow-job he&apos;s receiving from a john; when he comes the image of an entire house being dropped onto a desolate highway charges the screen.It&apos;s sad and beautiful, and, is a perfect statement on Mike&apos;s yearning for a home he never had.",

      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s to you Mrs. Robinson. Was it the song by Simon and Garfunkel made popular by the film, or did the film entrench the song into popular culture? Who&apos;s to say either way? It&apos;s a matter of opinion, and it&apos;s irrelevant really. The fact is, it&apos;s a great song and a great movie and the two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly, ham and swiss or May and December.\n\nThis movie is for anyone who&apos;s ever wondered what they are going to do with their future, anyone who&apos;s been in love with someone their parents didn&apos;t approve of, or anyone who&apos;s had an affair with one of their parent&apos;s friends. Granted, not many will fall in the latter category, but it throws an interesting spin on the film.\n\nThe film perfectly encapsulates and portrays the feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment and unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college. Dustin Hoffman is the only person we can possibly imagine in the role of Benjamin as his imprint and superb acting makes this film a great one. As reflected on in an interview with Dustin Hoffman on the DVD, &quot;The Graduate at 25&quot;, his life changed after this film, propelling him into something of a superstar status as his incredible talent found wide recognition. When I saw &quot;Rushmore&quot; I had a similar feeling about young Jason Schwartzman in the lead role. For him, time will tell. Although &quot;Rushmore&quot; isn&apos;t the time tested success that &quot;The Graduate&quot; is, anyone who enjoyed &quot;Rushmore&quot; would likely enjoy &quot;The Graduate&quot; if they haven&apos;t already seen it. They are, however, distinctly different films.\n\nThis comedy is something of a benchmark in many ways. Not many films of a comedic nature are so socially relevant and of such high quality that they make the A.F.I.&apos;s top ten of all time. The film by many standards is more than just a contemporary comedy. It is quite possibly the best one ever made, given its widespread appeal.\n\nIt is well shot with interesting sequences and hilarious segments that hold up against the test of time. It has been a long-time favourite of mine, and I can scarcely imagine growing tired of it.",

      "reviewBody": "Runaway Bride is just a good romantic comedy. Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film&apos;s 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. \n\nJulia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. \n\nBy the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie&apos;s wedding that it&apos;s a wonder that Ike wasn&apos;t honored for his &apos;false&apos; column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. \n\nRunaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni&apos;s face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.",

      "reviewBody": "World War I has been very neglected by the movie industry, so that fact in itself makes this film slightly &quot;unusual&quot;. While it&apos;s impossible to say how &quot;accurate&quot; this depiction of life in the trenches really is, to my eye the sets, the uniforms, the equipment etc. looked pretty impressive. However, I did have a problem with the gratuitous use of the &quot;f&quot; word, which all the characters seemed to use more and more as the film went on. I have nothing at all against &quot;bad language&quot; in a movie if it&apos;s in the right context, but swearing just for the sake of it just gets boring after a while - and more to the point, did young British men nearly 90 years ago REALLY say &quot;f**k&quot; all the time, as young men these days seem to? I would guess not. As a youngster I knew a number of old soldiers (elderly neighbours, great uncles and the like) who had actually fought in the First World War, and I don&apos;t recall ever hearing one of them use even mild profanities. So to my ear, much of the banter between the young soldiers in the movie seemed somewhat anachronistic. I also had a problem with the scene when the troops finally went &quot;over the top&quot; towards the end of the movie. Instead of marching across a devastated, shell-cratered moonscape which was typical of World War I battlefields, we had them marching across a very lush, green English field bearing not a single scar of war!!! This, and the complete absence of enemy troops in the movie (apart from the solitary prisoner brought back from a night raid) betrayed the film&apos;s low budget. A moderately interesting film that has you sympathising with the characters by the end, but I won&apos;t be going out of my way to give it a second viewing and I&apos;m glad that I saw it on TV, rather than spending hard-earned money on the DVD. 5 out of 10.",

The female lead role is played by Maryam Zaree and i think she has a great future as an actress if she keeps going like that. Her play was just excellent! Although the other actors where also very good. The movie takes place in Berlin (Germany) an shows the lifes of some people, while they struggle combining their western life and their Islamic religion. It gives a good perspective on the modern life of immigrants in Germany without judging anything. I highly recommend to go and watch the movie while it&apos;s still in cinemas. loved it!",

      "reviewBody": "There is a fleeting moment in THE POLAR EXPRESS where the title vehicle passes a department store with an elaborate Christmas display in the window. Everyone is excited by the sight, especially the story&apos;s protagonist, &quot;Hero Boy,&quot; until he sees the mechanical gears that reveal the display&apos;s Santa Claus to be a machine. That&apos;s the problem with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it is a splendid, wildly inventive machine, but it keeps on reminding us that it, quite literally, lacks a human face. \n\nBased on Chris Van Allsburg&apos;s slight but textured children&apos;s book, the film attempts to capture that book&apos;s subtle, albeit dark, visual tone. And for the most part the filmmakers do a stunning job. The artwork and animation, done largely with computers, is rich and detailed and often about as close to lifelike as any animation that I have ever seen. Therefore it is ironic that the remarkably high standards the film sets with most of the animation and artwork only serves to highlight the other aspects of the art that do fail so jarringly. The train, the snow, the sweeping landscapes and even the animals such as wolves and reindeer are all so incredibly meticulous in detail and movement, that it only makes the failure of the artists to replicate the human characters all the more startling and disappointing. The human beings in the story seem trapped in a limbo, being neither quite cartoon and certainly not quite human. \n\nIt is strange that the animators do an outstanding job of recreating skin texture and coloring and even the various subtleties of hair, but can&apos;t quite recreate the most revealing aspect of being human, the eyes. The mouth movements are disappointing too, but it is the eyes that are, well, just plain creepy. Like the characters in Japanese anime or the sad orphans painted on black velvet, these characters have eyes that have a cold, spookiness to them. They are a mild, if unrelenting, distraction in some scenes, but they quietly spoil many of the major moments where the film strives for an emotional intimacy. It is a serious problem when you literally don&apos;t want to look a character in the eye, especially if the character is a child. \n\nThe film uses a technology called &quot;performance capture,&quot; wherein an actor actually gives a three-dimensional performance which is recorded digitally by a computer, to then be manipulated into animated art. Performance capture is an extension of CGI and, as used in films like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, further blurs the line between what is animation and what is special effects. The process seems to work fairly well as far as body movement goes; the animated characters move with genuine lifelike grace that is far superior to previous attempts, such as the animated action sequences in SPIDER-MAN or THE HULK. Indeed, a dance sequence involving a band of hyperkenetic waiters is a showstopper. But the process just does not work as far as detailing facial features. \n\nCartoon humans from Elmer Fudd to Fred Flintstone are more simplistic, yet more human than the waxworks faces in THE POLAR EXPRESS. Their cartoonishness gives them a personality that is missing from the POLAR EXPRESS characters. I suppose that as the technology progresses, the ability to create totally believable human faces will be achieved to some credible degree. But the question is why? It&apos;s like making vanilla wafers with artificial flavoring; why seek a substitute for something natural and superior. \n\nThe director of THE POLAR EXPRESS is Robert Zemeckis, a clever and skilled craftsman whose work includes the brilliant WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, a film that blends real and cartoon images wonderfully. THE POLAR EXPRESS would have been so much better had they followed the lead of ROGER RABBIT and, like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, merged high-tech trickery with the simple honesty of the human face. Repeatedly throughout THE POLAR EXPRESS, I found myself wishing certain scenes were featuring real actors; I can&apos;t think of any other time where I thought a cartoon would be better as live action. \n\nDespite its optimistic Yuletide moral about the power of believing and its child&apos;s eye view of the world, the film really isn&apos;t a kids movie. THE POLAR EXPRESS has a Twilight Zone quality to it; not unlike the many versions of A CHR1STMAS CAROL or IT&apos;S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The film is dark, and even in its most upbeat moments the story and the storytelling are strangely subdued. Not quite brooding or grim, but far from joyful. While obviously directing the film towards children, the filmmakers don&apos;t seem to understand kids. Little things are telling, like failing to give the characters names other than generic titles, like Hero Boy, Lonely Boy, Hero Girl, Know-It-All, etc. Such a lame literary device as reducing a character to a nameless symbolic entity is lost on children; they want to know people&apos;s names. Children can&apos;t relate to nameless, faceless characters. Neither can adults for that matter. Humans have names, and for that matter so do cartoon characters.\n\nThough it is seriously flawed, THE POLAR EXPRESS is still a remarkable effort, visually stunning and ultimately even emotionally rewarding. But no amount of artistic talent can capture the simple beauty or honesty of a living child&apos;s face; it may have been folly for the filmmakers to even try."

      "reviewBody": "Fantasia 2016: &apos;MAN UNDERGROUND&apos;: Four Stars (Out of Five)\n\nAnother entry in this year&apos;s &apos;Fantasia International Film Festival&apos;, is this indie comedy-drama flick; written, produced and directed by first time feature filmmakers Michael Borowiec and Sam Marine. It&apos;s about an awkward conspiracy theorist, that enlists his friend, and a waitress he just met, to help him make a movie about his past encounters with aliens; while he was working for the government. The film stars George Basil, Pamela Fila, Andy Rocco and Felix Hagen. For a low-budget indie flick, that I had previously never heard of, the film is quite a treat!\n\nWillem Koda (Basil) is a retired geologist, that lives in a small New York town. He&apos;s constantly trying to spread his stories, about alien encounters while working for the US government, to as large an audience as he can find. His friend, Todd (Rocco), helps him post YouTube videos, about his experiences. Todd also suggests that Willem make a movie, telling viewers his life story. After Willem meets Flossie (Fila), a new waitress at the local restaurant that he frequently dines at, he feels inspired to make the film. Flossie has always wanted to be an actress, and Todd is talented with video producing skills. The three decide to make the low-budget film together. \n\nThe movie is awkward, funny and emotionally involving. The three lead characters are all very lovable misfits, that are both likable and relatable. The actors portraying them all give decent performances as well (Felix Hagen is really good too, as Flossie&apos;s jerk boyfriend). The flick is definitely a slow-paced character study, and you&apos;re never really sure of where it might be going; but it&apos;s always fascinating, and oddly involving as well. The filmmakers definitely show off some talent here, with very little money.\n\nWatch our movie review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA",

It&apos;s an affectionate (and, for Allen, atypically nostalgic) period piece, sketching with disarming humor the memories, anecdotes, and fantasies of an East Coast childhood in the 1930s and 1940s, narrated by the director himself and set against a collection of once-popular radio songs and programs. Television could never trigger such glowing memories, because TV numbs the imagination while the invisibility of the radio voice tends to enhance it. Allen includes plenty of jokes to that effect: the heroic Masked Avenger turns out, off microphone, to be the portly Wallace Shawn; the nonsense song Mairsie Doates recalls a neighbor brandishing a meat cleaver on a downtown rampage. The comedy is never more than feather-light, demanding nothing from its audience except uncomplicated laughter, but this is one filmmaker who has always been more effective on a smaller scale.",

As a previous reviewer said, it is more &quot;intense&quot; than an Inconvenient Truth, but I hardly think any of the concepts presented are hard to take in - in fact, due to the number of interviews, the film manages to take the viewer through a range of issues regarding the state of the planet, without ever losing focus of its basic message - that we must do something NOW. A well put together soundtrack enhances the narrative. Well worth the watch. But god, we&apos;ve really stuffed this planet up.",

      "reviewBody": "Movie Review: Eternal Summer (2006) By Ken Lee\n\nThis movie was a box office success in its native Taiwan when it was released late last year, garnering 4 nominations in Taiwan&apos;s Golden Horse Award along the way, and an eventual win for one of its male leads (Bryant CHANG Jui-chia, or ZHANG Ruijia in pinyin, who plays Jonathan KANG Zhenxing in a nuanced performance repletes with all the requisite repressed troubled mood), though a nod for its other male lead (Joseph CHANG Hsiao-chuan, or ZHANG Xiaoquan in pinyin, who plays the other-worldly Shane YU Souheng with tremendous vigour and enough *bling*), for the role of the high school jock and the object of desire of Jonathan, will be just as pleasing. \n\nBut the movie&apos;s success is less sterling in HK, where it just opens, presumably because movie-goers here typecast it with yet-another-melodramatic-Taiwanese-film association, and one with GLBT-theme at that, which is a shame, for it deserves a wider audience, even as it&apos;s one that isn&apos;t without minor flaws of its own, as befits the fate of most coming-of-age films helmed by relatively young directors (in this case, Leste CHEN, all of 25).\n\nThe plot is decidedly simple, and the narrative mostly linear, tracking the friendship and love of its 3 main protagonists (&quot;best friends&quot; Jonathan, Shane, and Carrie, played by Kate Yeung who shines in limited screen time) in their youth, from age 11 in a school in rural Hualian (in 1991) to age 18 (1998) to the college year in Taipei (2005), with all of their ensuing majesty, glory, anxiety, complicity, confusion, pang, angst, and a dreamy quality thrown in. \n\nThe film will benefit from some minor editing for a more even pace. Original music by Jeffrey CHENG is intrusive at best. These minor quibbles aside, cinematographer Charlie LAM&apos;s rendering of the rural locations is thing of pure magic and the theme song by Ah Xin (of the &quot;May Day&quot; rock band fame) blends in magnificently with the direction to which the film eventually takes. \n\nA friend asked if this is a tear-jerker to avoid at all costs. My answer to which is that hot and bitter tears may flow, not necessarily because of the inherent sadness of the human conditions, but may be because it deepens our understanding of those who are perceived to be &quot;different&quot; and living on the fringe. \n\nAnd if the measure of a film lies in whether the audience connects with the characters towards the end, and whether it leaves you with the sudden urge to be young and fell in love all over again, then it isn&apos;t to be missed; and so it seems &quot;Eternal Summer&quot; is a welcome addition to the growing list of Taiwanese films with GLBT content. \n\nRecommended."

      "reviewBody": "To tell you the truth, I didn&apos;t expect anything out of this movie. I watched it only because top name actors, so my surprise is big in here. We&apos;ve got all: money, power, love and murders. And a very good movie also. This is not brilliant movie, but it is very watchable. Let me tell you why.\n\nStephen Hopkins directed &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; with very low budget, cause Hackman and Freeman were payed little and they are also executive producers. That means that this movie is theirs. They wanted to act in their own way and Hopkins couldn&apos;t do nothing about it. It turned out that that is great. Gene Hackman adds another stunning performance in his long career and Morgan Freeman follows him. Hackman had harder role so it is normal that he will be remembered in a context of this movie. Hackman plays a lawyer Henry Hearst, who is called to come to the police station to clear up a few loose ends in his witness report of a murder of young girl. Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) is asking Henry all sorts of the questions, along with detective Felix Owens (Thomas Jane). That interview is said to be very short cause Henry has to make his speech on a found raising party. There his young wife Chantal (Monica Bellucci) waits for him, just like the creme of San Juan&apos;s society.\n\nAs the movie goes on we found out lots of things about Henry Hearst. About his marriage with young and beautiful Chantal, about their problems and about his job. Henry becomes first suspect for murder and raping of two girls because of his little lies in his testimony. Benezet and Owens thinks he is the murderer and they are not alone in that. Chantal also suspects and that&apos;s what hurts Henry the most. Their relationship is shown on all levels and that&apos;s why characters of Freeman and hostile Jane suffers. But I liked that cause Hackman grab the opportunity to shine. Maybe his role in here could remind you on &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, where Hackman plays similar role. But that is his brilliance. This character is so much different then that one, cause he didn&apos;t want to repeat himself. I also liked twist at the ending and all the scenes where Hackman or others are telling the story (Freeman always enters in their story, right at the sight). That was great, the atmosphere of interrogation room is good and the whole movie is very underrated. So I advise you to take a look on this movie; at least for Gene Hackman&apos;s performance.",

The film said copyright 2009 - so perhaps it was re-edited. Overall I liked the movie, though as a gay man, I realized right away that it was from the viewpoint of the straight daughter. The theme that families of all kinds are valid was the best part. I wish that there had been more understanding of the gay characters, particularly in the era that the film was set. The gay characters seemed dim-witted and incompetent of detailed conversation. Perhaps that&apos;s the way they were supposed to appear. I wish the daughter who was the poet had more lines. She was terrific. I do congratulate the producer for a great film on her first try.",

From there we are given examples of pimps who seem to rely on foul language (however Americans do have some extremely colorful metaphors), prostitutes, crooked cops and truckers who are more goofy than anything. I liked the film, I enjoyed the plot and the action, and thought that overall, the movie was solid. It just nagged at me the way we were made to look.

Its all of a rather low quality in virtually all respects, yet with Vincent Price as a diabolical lead, the many foibles are easily overlooked. Phibes has risen from suspended animation and once more has a bee in his bonnet for those who killed his wife and took away his face. He&apos;s not content with simply killing them. Oh no, each murder is creative, elaborate and basically nonsensical in their conception. But still horrific somehow. There&apos;s no sport in criticizing the plot, questions like why Phibes conjures these nasty deaths for the lackeys of his enemy who are all actually ignorant and innocent of any wrongdoing. Then he chooses to reason with the one man who is actually trying to destroy him. Very EC comic inspired, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like this film. Keep this away formt he impressionable kids though. I saw this when I was really young, and the images were emblazened on my brain for all time. Beware!!!"

      "reviewBody": "This classic ultra-stylized and (in the words of the NYFF blurb) &quot;insanely gorgeous&quot; 1994 martial arts or &apos;wuxia&apos; film based on the Louis Cha novel &apos;The Eagle-Shooting Horses&apos; needs no introduction to film fans now, though before Tarantino&apos;s release of &apos;Chungking Exrpess&apos; Americans had to go to Chinatown theaters or rent pirated videotapes to see it; I saw it in Chinatown in a double bill with &apos;As Tears Go By&apos; (1988). A cinematic icon today, Wong Kar-wai didn&apos;t get international recognition till 1997 at Cannes (for &apos;Happy Together&apos;), and the majority of US art-house viewers didn&apos;t notice him till &apos;In the Mood for Love&apos; (2000). Now ironically since the huge blowout and exhaustion of Wong&apos;s epic &apos;2046&apos; (2004), a summing-up of his 60&apos;s nostalgia themes and characters, he seems to have reached a point of exhaustion, and his English-language romance &apos;Blueberry Nights&apos; (2007) was a critical failure. Re-editing &apos;Ashes of Time&apos; looks like another example of treading water, but it&apos;s still great to have it; many have still not seen it, and any films as visually magnificent as Wong&apos;s are best seen in theaters. It&apos;s also fortunate that all his films can be seen on decent DVD&apos;s now with readable subtitles for English speakers, instead of the weird earlier Hong Kong prints with flickering titles in Chinese and peculiar English that disappeared before you could read them. &apos;Ashes of Time Redux&apos; has the best English subtitles yet both visually and linguistically.\n\nAccording to Wong, &apos;Ashes of Time&apos; negatives weren&apos;t in very good shape, and a search of various versions led him to a huge warehouse somewhere near San Francisco&apos;s Chinatown that contained the entire history of Hong Kong movies. He and his team put together various versions, adding a bit to what we already know, digitally cleaning up the images and &quot;enhancing&quot; some of the color and doing things with the sound, adding a new score and &quot;re-arrangement&quot; by Wu Tong including cello solos by Yo Yo Ma.\n\nExperts will have to comb over all this to explain the differences. The cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who was present at the press screening of the film at the NYFF, doesn&apos;t like the enhancing of the color and neither do I. A lot of yellows and oranges are heightened, greenish-turquoise touches are set in, and many of the desert sand landscapes seem to have lost their surface detail. This seems unnecessary and even obtrusive, but it&apos;s not enough to spoil the experience. Other images simply look more pristine and clear. Wong wouldn&apos;t say what specific changes were made in the editing. He preferred to talk about how he adapted Louis Cha&apos;s novel and how this film relates to his oeuvre. Both for him and for Doyle it was an essential milestone. The cast features the late Leslie Cheung, both Tony Leungs (Chiu Wai and Ka Fai) and Jacky Cheung, and has Maggie Cheung as The Woman and martial arts film great Brigitte Lin as Murong Yin and Murong Yang, the sister and brother. Lin, now retired, was responsible for the revival of the genre and is central to this film, though Maggie Cheung is its diva, its dream lover.\n\nCha&apos;s novel is a complicated 4-volume wuxia genre epic, very popular but little known or appreciated in the West. Wong studied it carefully (and made a parody of it called &apos;Eagle-Shooting Heroes&apos;) but then though he says this film unlike all his others had a fixed plan (and thus made for a story full of fatalism), he threw away the story and just took a couple of the main characters and made up another simpler story imagining what the characters&apos; lives were like when they were young. A simpler story. Well. The story has always seemed completely incomprehensible to me but after re-watching &apos;Redux&apos; it obviously is nonetheless a coherent narrative; it&apos;s just intricate and, above all, cyclical. It ends as it begins, with the narrator looking into the camera and repeating the opening lines.\n\n&apos;Ashes of Time&apos; was shot in the desert. Doyle had never done that. The film was long delayed and the shoot was difficult. Doyle knew nothing about martial arts or &apos;Jianghu,&apos; the parallel universe of martial arts fiction. He was under extreme constraints, having very little artificial light. Nonetheless he produced some of the most beautiful sequences in modern film, because he&apos;s a great cinematographer, perhaps the greatest of recent decades, as Wong Kar-Wai is one of the defining contemporary cinematic geniuses.\n\nWong is notable for his meditative and arresting voice-overs. Here is a sample: &quot;People say that if a sword cuts fast enough, the blood spurting out will emit a sound like a sigh. Who would have guessed that the first time I heard that sound it would be my own blood?&quot; &quot;You gained an egg, but lost a finger. Was it worth it?&quot; There are aphorisms or bits of advice: &quot;Fooling a woman is never as easy as you think.&quot; The film is anchored and structured by the Chinese calendar: the Chinese almanac is divided into 24 solar terms and the narrative moves forward selectively through these terms, which contain weather descriptions (naturally) and advice as to what is propitious or unlucky and in what regions and directions. There is also a great deal about oblivion and forgetfulness (which are linked with wine, including a magic wine that eliminates memory). The desert and drinking are visual touchstones throughout as are pairs, opposites, and contrasts; and there is cross-dressing and perhaps bisexual love. The images are full of flickering light. The sword fights, which do not begin until more than half way into the film, are without the acrobatic feats actually performed or digitally faked as in current martial arts films, though they are elaborately staged by the action choreographer Sammo Hung. They are a symphony of fast cutting, closeups, blurs, and slow motion (which Wong intended particularly to express the fatigue of the Blind Swordsman in the film).",

      "reviewBody": "Wong Fei Hung is a legendary Chinese hero (like James Bond) whoe has some 90 films about him before this movie.  In fact Jackie Chan plays Wong Fei Hung in Legend of Drunken Master.  So this movie is not merely a kung fu movie. This movie&apos;s main theme is of Chinese culture vs Western culture as it is embodied by martial arts vs guns.  How can China remain beautiful in its art that requires years of dedication to master, when success can be so cheaply purchased with Western firearms?  Wong Fei Hung must make sense of it somehow, and in the end shows that while you can&apos;t fight guns with kung fu, that kung fu in the right hands can be just as deadly as guns.  (It&apos;s not the gun... it&apos;s the bullets.)\n\nWoven into this main theme is the theme of a lost sense of Chineseness and lack of communication.  The characters who cut off their queues (their symbol of loyalty to the Qing dynasty) because of desperation or confusion or ambition.  The Chinese/American who cannot read Chinese.  The mistaken Lion dance.\n\nBeyond this conflict, the movie has countless inside jokes for the fans of Honk Kong cinema.  The trampolines at the end were a tribute to the early kung fu movies that used them before wire techniques were introduced.  The scene where the two disciples have to dress up in the Peking Opera: Sammo Hung (TV&apos;s Martial Law) traditionally played the role of the butcher in this series.  He, along with the other character who dressed up in the movie were originally trained in Peking opera and form there entered kung fu movies. So it was an inside joke.  The nerdy character is played by one of Hong Kong&apos;s most popular pop singers.\n\nThis movie is simply incredible, even though the kung fu is not as satisfying as in some of Jet Li&apos;s other movies (The Legend and Fist of Legend).  I recommend seeing it on DVD.  That way you can see the original movie with subtitles.  Then you can go back and watch it with a running commentary.  Stay away from the English dubbed version, as it cuts scenes from the movie."

      "reviewBody": "Watching Andrzei Wajda&apos;s war movie &apos;Kanal&apos; one is stuck just by how short the interval was between the making of this film and the horrors it depicts. And while there were plenty of British and American war films made in the 1950s, it was perhaps easier to turn &quot;our&quot; story into the black-and-white banality of heroic fable, besides which, &quot;we&quot; could also make movies without communist censors looking over our shoulders. Wajda here chooses to fashion a tale centred on the collapse of the Polish resistance to the Nazis: the last survivors take to the sewers, the Germans pump gas down, and you know as soon as the film starts that there will be no happy endings, even for the survivors. It&apos;s a tale whose laconic nihilism would be remarkable in any era: I was reminded of the (much later) BBC nuclear-themed drama &apos;Threads&apos;, another tale of underground life facing extinction, while the dialogue, stoical in the face of impossible fate, offers more direct echos, for it made me think of the films of another Polish master, Krystoff Kieslowski. The most remarkable things in this film are the poetically bleak sequence of scenes that end it; it&apos;s biggest failing is the score, that (as with many films of this era) feels the need to describe the plot, and not merely to complement it. Occasionally other aspects of the movie also give away its age, but what&apos;s much more notable is the modernity (and hopelessness) of its approach to its material. A fine achievement, dating from an era when the events it portrayed were the present, not the past.",

      "reviewBody": "EASY VIRTUE is a clear example of the fact that making an outstanding film just isn&apos;t all that EASY!\n\nWhen was the last time a Noel Coward play was made into a movie, anyway? I could&apos;ve looked it up, but I&apos;ll leave it to you, if you really think it&apos;s all that important!\n\nI&apos;ll wager the Producers, Director &amp; Screenwriter didn&apos;t see most of the screen adaptations of his plays done in the 30&apos;s/40&apos;s on TV when they were kids, as I did.\n\nHonestly... Seemed they were a bit out of their element...at times. The end result: It&apos;s EASY to see the film was being pulled in several different directions, which was most apparent early on.\n\nIn fact, EASY can be divided into 3 segments of roughly 30 minutes each. Segment #1 really didn&apos;t seem to know where it was going. It suffered from poor pacing and a pervasive tension on the set that permeated several of the scenes.\n\nWhat really had me close to quitting on EASY were the very awkwardly inserted bits of slapstick, obviously an attempt at comic relief, but which seemed utterly contrived and out of synch with most every other aspect of the film!\n\nSegment #2 was a definite improvement. Toned down considerably were the scenes involving slapstick. Only a few brief moments, which were much better integrated into the overall work.\n\nThe culture-clash, the true razon d&apos;être of EASY, between Jessica Biel&apos;s character, Larita, an independent &amp; free-spirited American race-car driver of sorts, and the lady of the manor, Mrs. Whittaker (Kristin Scott Thomas/The English Patient), who turns out to be one lady with an extremely controlling and manipulative manner, is handled much more smoothly in the second segment, and, as a consequence, these scenes are much more amusing, even occasionally funny!\n\nThe closing segment really had me in its grip. The ensemble cast really shone. Finally, we see evidence of why so many of Noel Coward&apos;s plays were made into movies. All the outstanding elements; costumes, sets and music among others, really contributed to a very fulfilling final ½ hour! Colin Firth deserves a mention, perhaps, for EASY&apos;s best performance. Had the entire film been at segment three&apos;s level, 8*--EASY! However, I feel 6* is a fair overall rating.",

Pretty much every scene was one that you figured out how it would actually be like 10 minutes before it would come up, not even meantioning the &apos;heart&apos; that appears on her chest.\n\nI didnt know the actors at first (as I cant describe myself as someone wastching the oh-so-great (german) soap operas), but yeah, the acting, in fact anything about the movie sucked. There where some moments in the movie where one could hope, it would turn to the better - but the audience was mistaken at every scene that seemed like it.\n\nDont spend money on this at the theatre, dont go rent it on dvd, in fact, dont ever dare looking at the dvd cover of the movie."

      "reviewBody": "Dario Argento has gone on record as saying that The Cat o&apos; Nine Tails is his least favourite of all his own work. I was a bit surprised to hear that, although I must agree it&apos;s a flawed film. It&apos;s worth noting that, while it&apos;s generally regarded as something of a minor early work among his filmography, in his native Italy it remains his most popular video rental.\n\nThe Cat o&apos; Nine Tails is a murder mystery thriller that strays far closer to classic Hitchcock and Agatha Christie than to Argento&apos;s own later works which focused heavily on extreme violence and/or the supernatural. While the &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;-style whodunit plot has some clever, interesting twists and turns to keep you guessing, I did feel that Argento got rather bogged down in the mechanics of his plot at times. Also, at 112 minutes it&apos;s one of the only Argento films that slightly outstays its welcome.\n\nKarl Malden is excellent as Arno, the blind crossword puzzle designer. I enjoyed his charming interaction with both his little niece Lori and sleazy investigative journalist James Franco. There&apos;s one strikingly tense set piece where Franco is trapped in a dark crypt. The film also has an amiably jaunty comic tone in places. Perhaps my favourite feature of the whole movie was the excellent musical score of Ennio Morricone. A jazzy prog-rock soundtrack that mixes bass, percussion and trumpets, it&apos;s probably the coolest, grooviest music in any Argento film before he began collaborating with soundtrack maestros Goblin.\n\nAll in all, The Cat o&apos; Nine Tails is for me not quite as lively, memorable or inspired as Argento&apos;s strongest work, but it&apos;s still an entertaining and clever thriller that&apos;s well worth a look.",

      "reviewBody": "I was happy to rent &quot;Boo&quot; after reading that it was from the same producer as &quot;Dog Soldiers,&quot; which I found wonderfully relentless. While &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; is on my list of films to buy, I soon found &quot;Boo&quot; to be tedious. It is the sort of movie I began to watch in bits for it was becoming too aggravating to sit through in one stretch. While I appreciate horror films made on a small budget (and therefore, it can be assumed, made out of a passion for the genre and not a mere eye on box office returns), recent films, such as &quot;Boo,&quot; rely on SUDDEN LOUD NOISES to elicit their scare moments. (It&apos;s the new &apos;screeching cat leaping out&apos; gimmick.) This film made me jump once. However, when a film uses a LOUD NOISE or sudden ghost/killer reveal a second time, the impact is usually lessened, and when this happens a THIRD time, and then again, the &apos;scares&apos; become predictable for the audience now knows the rhythm of the film, that whenever there&apos;s a quiet moment, there will be a JOLT, or whenever a character is about to move out of frame, the ghost/killer will be standing there. And really, what suspense can be given to a film when there is an overuse of a creepy little girl suddenly, without actually moving, advancing toward another character, accompanied by A LOUD SOUND. The squeaking, slowly moving wheelchair was much more effective for then a sense of dread was built, a &apos;What&apos;s going to happen?&apos; apprehension. JOLTS just become numbing, and then boring.\n\nI can forgive bad acting but there are certain true reactions to which we can all relate and when a character does not REACT the way that we would, that is when the amateurish performance becomes distracting. If my girlfriend/boyfriend or best friend is murdered, my reaction is horror and anger; in this film, there is shock (and one character gets very upset and weepy) but then everyone just seems to gloss over this and resumes looking for a way to escape the hospital. The murder then becomes a mere plot device, another &apos;reanimated dead&apos; complication for our remaining cast to soon deal with.\n\nGreat use of a particular costume however, and it&apos;s always wonderful to see Dee Wallace Stone on screen.",

He thought that it was good news that the Russians were coming closer. He could not m=keep that to himself so he went and told this to one of his friends who was not supposed to say anything. After a short while the whole Ghetto was talking about those news. Jakob saw that everybody was feeling much better so he continued to tell lies about the news. This is a movie that gets better and better as it moves along. It also gives hope to the Jewish people in the Ghetto and Jakob was having good intentions but it just complicated itself more and more."

His documentary style film illustrates the life of the internationally well-known and successful independent photographer Ziv Koren. His dramatic pictures right from the front-lines have covered a lot of top world magazines, like e.g. The Times.\n\nFor two years Avital followed the world photo press award winner Koren through his everyday-life.\n\nHe does not only show his work, where Koren sneaks into highly dangerous war zones, talks to Islamic top terrorists or takes photo of a bus who got blown up by suicidal assassin just an hour ago... he also contrasts this very cleverly and tense with scenes of Koren&apos;s wife ( an actress and model) and his two children.\n\nThe 45 min. lasting film shows how surreal life in those areas of the world has become and how people, living in the western world try to ignore it. Beyond that it gives the audience insight on the feelings of the master of photography Ziv Koren who risks his life every day for new, fresh pictures of Terror, War, Violence and Death.\n\nA great film - definitely worth watching, Patrick H."

The storyline follows Johnny Ringo trying to make some money however he can, as a hired gun or in the gold business but he doesn&apos;t take the law, or much else, seriously. Meanwhile, a Mexican and some Native Americans are about to arrive in the town Ringo is in looking for revenge for the deaths of the Mexican&apos;s brothers. An epic shootout is sure to ensue.\n\nThis movie is directed by Sergio Corbucci (Django) and stars Mark Damon (House of Usher), Giulia Rubini (David and Goliath), Andrea Aureli (The Loves of Hercules), Loris Loddi (House of Gucci) and Ettore Manni (War of the Zombie).\n\nThe settings and shootouts are the best part of the movie. The shootouts are well executed and entertaining. The dialogue is okay too; although, the comedic elements were a bit cheesy. The drunken Native American cliche was blah. This just wasn&apos;t as funny as it tried to be. The storyline could have been better, and the acting is inconsistent.\n\nOverall, this is a very average addition to the spaghetti western genre. I would score a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",

      "reviewBody": "No, it&apos;s not *good*, I won&apos;t go that far. When you think of what it *could* have been, you feel cheated. The remarks listed in reviews stand: the focus isn&apos;t always there, the supposedly main character was relegated to being mere support, the pacing is often off - for example, the chariot race manages to look way less exciting than it should be, so one can speculate where the fault lies - the camera-work, the editing... I think it&apos;s the direction. The director(s) and the producer(s) went to create a film for about a bazillion types of audiences (and I don&apos;t blame them, when there are 70+ million Euros to justify and return) but that&apos;s a pretty tough goal. It worked for the original comic where the kids get the gags and the subtle education, and the adults get the clever wordplay and densely packed historical, literary, and other references, but this doesn&apos;t mean it will necessarily work in another medium. So there are too many plots (patched together from several Astérix books - this was the demise of the first film too, so future takers, learn!), too many people to satisfy, and too many actors and celebrities. To hold all those egos in check one needs a stronger director or team than the newbies (sorry, but it&apos;s true) this film had. I have the impression that they went with the idea that if they throw enough money and enough famous names into the cauldron the film will make itself, but, eh, no. This film desperately needed somebody who could shape it better because it&apos;s obvious where things were cut (some scenes make no sense) and they should have used the *titular character* a lot more. It must be said however that for an amusing night&apos;s out it&apos;s a perfectly fine piece of entertainment. We laughed quite a lot. Depardieu and Delon deliver, Poelvoorde is a comedian I&apos;d not heard of before but now I&apos;m interested in his other work, and as for the new Astérix - Clovis Cornillac - well, he got the character down to a T: he&apos;s too tall and a little too fit, sure, but he looks pretty darn much like the guy in the comic book and he moves and talks just like him. I&apos;d never seen a fictional character recreated with such essential accuracy and since this must be even more difficult when the source material is based on grotesque and exaggeration, this is quite an achievement. Hopefully, Mr Cornillac will have (and accept) another chance to play in an Astérix film, this time with a bigger role.",

He wants the eggs, and he&apos;s determined to get them. They are being watched by Lieutenant Weber, who has been trying to get Ripley for years.\n\nFreeman and Banderas didn&apos;t have much chemistry, and Freeman, of course, is capable of roles having much more depth. So both kind of glided along, Banderas using his charm, and Freeman his geniality.\n\nDerivative story with a couple of twists. A decent rental.",

      "reviewBody": "This was a film that I obtained when I was trying to get the original one. I decided since I already had it to go ahead and check it out anyways. I did end up digging the original and I believe at the time of writing this it&apos;s been roughly a year since that viewing. The synopsis for this one is tax collector Ning (Shaoqun Yu), a clumsy and easily frightened man, decides to help a village by going up the nearby mountain. When he and his crew decide to stay in what they think is an abandoned temple, they discover a supernatural evil.\n\nFirst off, if I credit the wrong character to the incorrect actor/actress, I apologize. The Internet Movie Database names are slightly different from the subtitles on what I watched. We do start this off with a demon hunter, Yan Chixia (Louis Koo). He falls in love with a demon he is supposed to kill, Nie Xiaoqian (Yifei Liu). It turns out to be a test from the master demon hunter, Ha Suet Fun Lui (Siu-Wong Fan). They are trying to destroy a Tree Demon (Kara Wait). Because of Yan&apos;s delay, Ha loses an arm. She is banished, threatening to return.\n\nIt then shifts into the future. We have Ning Caichen (Yu) as he makes his way through the wilderness. He tries to use a well and is taken prisoner, dropping an amulet. Ti Nga (Jing Li) finds and grabs it. Ning is being treated as a thief by the village chiefs, Elvis Tsui and Hark-On Fung. Ti arrives just in time and they free him. Ning is confused to be help from the capital as this village is experiencing a drought. He is supposed to go up the mountain to fix the water supply. No one will come with him though, out of fear of something supernatural. They&apos;re very quiet about what though. Ning is accompanied by Ti and a group of prisoners that are forced.\n\nThey come to a large tree and Ning believes there must be water nearby. He finds a small white fox inside of it and gives it a piece of candy. A storm rolls in and the men must seek shelter. They use what they think is an abandoned temple. There&apos;s a pool inside of it and Ning starts to test it, to see if this is the answer he is looking for. His men are enticed away by demons that take the form of women. Ning also encounters Nie. She comes on to him pretty aggressive and he rebuffs her. He is smitten though.\n\nAll of the men are killed and Yan, who is much older now, arrives and killing many of the demons. Nie and Ning flee from the temple. Ning thinks he is a psychopath. The Tree Demon needs Ning to free herself, but Nie is torn on what to do. Yan tries to prevent her from taking Ning and releasing herself from banishment. The water from the pool in the temple also poisons the town and Ha must come back to destroy the Tree Demon for good.\n\nThere&apos;s where I want to leave the recap and I should point out there&apos;s quite a bit of things that I left out. This movie runs around 100 minutes, but I will say that it never really drug for me. Visually this movie is pretty great if I&apos;m going to be honest. I&apos;m glad that they kept what was done in the original, but just used more of the technology that is available to them.\n\nSince I&apos;m a story guy that is where I want to go first. I&apos;m interested in Chinese history, especially the Three Kingdoms era, but aside from that, I&apos;m pretty green with their lore. Now since I&apos;ve seen the original and this version, this story is told in very similar ways. It is interesting that their take on demons are just beautiful women that steal men&apos;s life-force. We do see that they harbor the more monstrous take that we get in the western world as well. That doesn&apos;t come out until provoked or they&apos;re killed. It is cool though having the Tree Demon that is powerful and wanting out.\n\nThere&apos;s also this social commentary here about forbidden love. It starts with Yan whose job it is to kill demons. Nie and him do fall in love in the beginning, but they know they can&apos;t be together. That prevents him from killing her though. The Tree Demon toys with this when dealing with Nie when she falls for Ning. With how it plays out in the end, it really does kind of feel like a love story that doesn&apos;t have a happy ending. I feel this can be correlated to things like marrying outside of your financial circumstances or race or a multitude of factors. Those are just the more common ones.\n\nEven though I really liked this movie, I still think that it is too long. I&apos;m on board for the set up that we get here. They don&apos;t go really that deep into the mythology, but we really don&apos;t need it. I do think there are some parts that just run a little bit long without adding a whole lot to the overall product. It does culminate with a pretty epic battle scene, which I&apos;m not going to lie, runs almost 20 minutes. We do get quite a bit of action throughout, but there are just some things that could be tightened up in my eyes.\n\nShifting this over the acting, I thought it was pretty solid. Koo is great as this demon hunter that has a sense of duty, which I know is important in Asian cultures, and wanting to be with his forbidden lover. He becomes a bitter older man which he does really well. Liu is quite attractive and I liked her in a similar vein as Yan. Yu does great as playing this bumbling guy. It really feels real that he is that guy and there&apos;s also an innocence about him that works. Wai is also really good. I love how villainous she is, but I don&apos;t hate her completely for whatever reason. She&apos;s a demon and she is doing what she is supposed to. She is also utilizing men and their desires which I can&apos;t blame her. The rest of the cast is fine in rounding this out for what is needed.\n\nThat will take me to the last thing I really wanted to go over which are the effects. Since the original came out 30+ years prior, they decided to use CGI here. I will say there were only a few times that it took me out of things. For the most part, I think they use to enhance aspects and it makes for some beautiful shots. It seems they couple it with the wire work that they were known for. I&apos;m not the biggest fan of it, I will admit that, but I&apos;ve come to appreciate what they&apos;re doing with it. I like the look of the &apos;demon essence&apos;. The tiny little fox is adorable. Even though there was a few times that I could tell it was CGI. Overall the effects are pretty solid. The cinematography is also beautiful as well.\n\nNow with that said, I&apos;m glad that I decided to actually watch this movie, because I&apos;ll be honest, I ended up really enjoying it. It has an interesting story with some commentary behind it. The visuals are pretty amazing even if all of the effects don&apos;t necessarily work for me. I&apos;d say the performances from all of the stars were pretty solid and the supporting cast helped to build what they needed. It does run a bit long in my eyes and there&apos;s some stuff that could have been trimmed to tighten it up. Aside from that, the soundtrack fit for what they needed as well. I would say that this is above average and a lot of fun. Be warned, this is from China and Hong Kong so I watched it with subtitles on. If that is an issue, avoid this as I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll enjoy it. If not, it is a fun little film for sure.",

      "name": "Disappointing BLONDES Never Figured Out What It Wanted To Be",
      "reviewBody": "Screwball comedies have been around for decades. There are many good ones, and, it stands to reason, that there are as many (if not more) bad ones. I&apos;m not particular fond of them; I don&apos;t dislike them, but I do think they&apos;re certainly hard to pull off with a winning script. And when you don&apos;t have a winning script? Well, then you spin it like you do, and that&apos;s largely what you get with something that&apos;s as banal and predictable as CONCRETE BLONDES – it isn&apos;t a total failure, but it probably won&apos;t win many converts to the careers of the involved talent.\n\nThat&apos;s a shame, too, because it could have. Perhaps if it hadn&apos;t been in the hands of such an inexperienced writer AND director – one who may&apos;ve seen the other&apos;s weaknesses in time to salvage this. I think everyone – audience included – deserved better.\n\n(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters. If you&apos;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&apos;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment. If, however, you&apos;re accepting of a few modest hints at &apos;things to come,&apos; then read on )\n\nDaytime accountant Kris Connifer (played by Carly Pope) can&apos;t quite catch a break. At work, she&apos;s struggling with clients who can&apos;t pay for her services in cash, while at home she&apos;s torn between the antics of her live-in-gal-pal Tara (the always lovely Samaire Armstrong) and their sexy roommate Sammi (Diora Baird). But when Tara and Sammi stumble across a drug deal gone bad, they find themselves in possession of a suitcase with over three million dollars. Could it actually be the answers to all of their money woes, or will it drive the girls to do unspeakable things all in the pursuit of untold riches?\n\nWhat hampers CONCRETE BLONDES the most is that fact that it never establishes a quality tone from the get-go. The opening scenes play like a bit of farce, and not much later – once the three ladies are thrown together – it vacillates between drama and downright screwball lunacy. Then – in the final act – it goes full bore farce once more before eventually succumbing to an almost dystopia-lite urban crime thriller. Simply put, BLONDES wanted to be more than it was ever capable of being, and that&apos;s logically the fault of writer/director Nicholas Kalikow. Instead of trying to embrace all elements of perhaps the films he most likes and/or respects, he should&apos;ve dialed back all of the influences, kept it simple, and then gone for broke.\n\nOf course, putting all of the blame on Kalikow&apos;s shoulders would dismiss the relatively inadequate performances he manages to eek out of these players. In particular, Armstrong is the only one I think far more capable of giving more than she did here (I&apos;ve seen her in a handful of projects, so I trust she did the best she felt possible with the material); and veteran character actor John Rhys-Davies served as little more than a functional &apos;heavy&apos; for the purposes of the mildly convoluted plot. As for Pope and Baird? Meh. Thankfully, all of the ladies are easy on the eyes, so much so that a tighter edit or a more tightly delivered tale would&apos;ve given this a greater chance to find an audience.\n\nUnless I miss my guess here, BLONDES is exactly the kind of film most regular folks want to like, especially when it comes to crime capers. You&apos;ve got good-looking ladies – each with a different version of the classic heart of gold – who&apos;ve all been wrong by that big, mean world outside. You want them to get their acts together. You want them to succeed, even if that means taking it on the lam and heading south of the border where no one will ever find them and their suitcase of stolen cash. Had it all started and stopped there, then I suspect this one would&apos;ve had a greater chance to win hearts and minds. Unfortunately, that isn&apos;t the case, and we&apos;re all left – like the girls – wishing for something most will never have.\n\nIt&apos;s a disappointment, but it&apos;s not awful. Just a disappointment.\n\nCONCRETE BLONDES (2012) is produced by CB Films North and Sacred Bull Media. DVD distribution is being handled through Inception Media Group. As for the technical specifications, this indie-style feature boasts the same quality sight and sound you&apos;d find associated to practically any other indie-style feature. As is often the case when these smaller films find eventual release, there are no special features to speak of, save for the theatrical trailer: I&apos;m not sure much is lost by having nothing extra, as there was little here of any great substance.\n\nMODESTLY RECOMMENDED as more than a &apos;curiosity&apos; than anything else. CONCRETE BLONDES isn&apos;t a bad attempt at trying to do something a bit avant-garde with storytelling: it has an interesting criss-crossing and out-of-chronological-order narrative, and it tries to mix a contemporary twist on screwball comedies with the gritty crime caper kinda/sorta like Quentin Tarantino likes. Sadly, it doesn&apos;t do either all that successfully – performances aren&apos;t quite manic enough when they need to be, nor are they &apos;screwball&apos; enough when it&apos;s required of the players – and it&apos;s all edited together with an almost &apos;who cares?&apos; motif. Sadly, it could&apos;ve been a tight little gem if someone had paid closer attention to what makes these uniquely twisted films work instead of going for the workmanship grade. Better luck with a remake. \n\nIn the interests of fairness, I&apos;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Inception Media Group provided me with an advance DVD copy of CONCRETE BLONDES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",

Will Paige and Edvard save Batlavia? The first Prince and Me was the best of the franchise. While this movie is cute, it is a typical sequel when a franchise tries to keep a story line going. The only time a sequel works, besides a good story line, is using the same actors with the same chemistry. While there is some consistency, it is always disappointing and gives the movie a &quot;B&quot; rated feeling. (especially when it doesn&apos;t go to theaters). It is cute and if you liked the second one, you&apos;ll like this one. I still prefer the original.",

      "reviewBody": "This is such a great film on so many levels I can&apos;t really settle on where to begin.  It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film&apos;s history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson&apos;s career/real life cameos/DeMille&apos;s involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today&apos;s film writers should take note.  If that weren&apos;t enough, there&apos;s even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era).  What&apos;s interesting is that now, so many years later, we&apos;re looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950&apos;s is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920&apos;s is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don&apos;t think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today&apos;s audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don&apos;t often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.\n\nIn response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): &quot;...we didn&apos;t need dialogue; we had faces&quot;, I&apos;d like to also add that they &quot;didn&apos;t need movies; they had films.&quot;\n\nThey truly don&apos;t make them like this anymore. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "K3, Kathleen, Kristel and Karen, are one of Belgiums best known girl-groups. For the first time on the big screen, they show no real talent for acting in this simple children&apos;s story about three young women which act like three kindergarten kids. They find a magical medallion, just as two villains arrive at their newly bought old mansion. The villains try to charm them out of their genie-bearing jewelry and later decide to just steal it, to bring world power to their master, an obscure villain. The rather short movie (59 Min&apos;s) seems much longer, for its dullness and predictable plot. Of course the villains are blundering idiots, of course the three girls only have infantile wishes, of course they (almost) run out of wishes and of course everything will turn out just fine in the end (that is: all returns to normal). Young children (from ages 4 up to 8) will appreciate this movie for its nice tone, fairytale wonders and of course the charming K3. They probably won&apos;t raise an eyebrow when seeing the three women share the same bed and even cuddle each other in their sleep... Their parents might doze off after a few minutes, only to be awakened by Dutch TV-host-turned-actor Paul De Leeuw as the genie - a hilarious, hysterical version of Robin Williams&apos;s same role in Disney&apos;s Aladdin.",

Mitchum also has a Southern belle wife who&apos;s locked the bedroom door against him for 18 years.  Simmering tensions and overcooked dialogue make this just incredible fun - see it if you can."

Intruders is filled with some good ideas however the story and pacing fall flat on it&apos;s face. The movie tries to twist and turn the viewer with it&apos;s twist-ish ending but however it fails to create any emotion because it keeps certain details hidden from the viewer. The acting is okay throughout the film nothing great, but decent. however the one thing that kills this movie for me is the scene&apos;s where hollowface is all cgi. It&apos;s completely uncalled for and looks awful. I wish this movie could have been better but unfortunately it&apos;s lacking.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very delicate subject and the filmmaker at hand might not have been the best choice. His directing (Moritz B. as Goebbels would have needed some guidance), his poor choices in staging some scenes and other flaws become very apparent.\n\nOn the other hand, he is not afraid to go places, that others might not have dared (an intercourse that is so absurd, it&apos;s almost funny, if it weren&apos;t tragic ... and a scene you will either love or hate). Of course the faux documentary style tries to recreate a feeling of what happened back then. But the fact, that he was just a director for hire, seems to apparent.\n\nHe did not really check or confront himself too much with the story. Instead opting on doing what he got from the script (or his interpretation of it). And it&apos;s a shame that some powerful scenes such a the one in a tent, were the movie is shown, with reactions, is getting sidetracked and completely dismissed by the next set-up outside the tent, when it seems to be a completely different movie, with no class or style attached to it.\n\nMoretti on the other hand (as most actors), try their best. You cannot fault him (or his &quot;wife&quot; in the movie) for any shortcomings of the end result. With a subject matter like this you could expect a better movie. Some parts are really good and it&apos;s ambiguity is still something I cherish (that&apos;s why I rated it so &quot;high&quot;). Still there is no constant flow and the mood is all over the place ... same goes for Bleibtreus Goebbels ...",

After getting to watch it all the way, I think that it&apos;s decent for a Hindi animated film distributed by Disney, even if I can&apos;t understand half of what they&apos;re saying.\n\nI understand that it&apos;s intended to be a comedy film, but some of it was either confusing because of the Hindi dialogue, or wasn&apos;t funny at all. The songs, because it&apos;s also a musical, and in contrast to the comedy, are fantastic. The first and second songs on the soundtrack have been stuck in my head for a couple days now; The soundtrack is simply that fantastic.\n\nI would want to recommend the film, but somewhat terrible comedy, predictable story, and confusing dialogue makes such a decent film slightly not worth it to watch, but the great soundtrack makes for a great time with Romeo and his friends.",

      "reviewBody": "What is a Western? The genre conjures up images of gun totting cowboys, reckless outlaws and fierce encounters in countryside saloons. True, this was the setting that prevailed during the 19th century American West.\n\nA few directors in the past have tried to present the West in a more refined way, giving importance to the settings and the characterization. Among them is Henry Hathaway&apos;s True Grit, an emotionally charged Western about a fearless; one-eyed Marshall named Rooster Cogburn.\n\nThe film very stylishly brings to fore the Western countryside, from the scenario at a public hanging to the courtroom drama. In the latter we see some tense and heated exchange of words between the prosecuting lawyer and the Marshall.\n\nThe intriguing plot unfolds itself very nicely on the silver screen. The story is simple. Tom Cheney, a cowboy, kills his employer. Maddie (Kim Darby), the headstrong daughter of the employer, vows to take revenge and get Cheney hanged for the murder of her father. For the mission she enlists the support of one Rooster Cogburn (John Wayne). Now this Rooster is the meanest Marshall in the entire territory. Having lost one of his eyes in the war, he is totally fearless in disposition, talks brazenly and has an unconventional sense of humor. Despite his hardened exterior, he is warm and benevolent at heart. This is evident in the conversations between him and Maddie.\n\nThe third angle to the mission comes in the form of Sgt Lebeof (Glen Campbell), an enthusiastic Texas Ranger, who is after Cheney for his own motive of collecting ransom money. At first instance, Maddie has reservations about Lebeof. He comes across as an ill mannered, uncivilized guy to her. Convinced that Maddie will not make him a party to the pursuit of Cheney, Lebeof, secretively, unknowing from her, teams up with Rooster. He takes Rooster into confidence and through him manages an entry into the chase for Cheney. \n\nThe character of Lebeof is an interesting study. He comes across as an inexperienced person who has a knack for saying something silly all the times. He is rebuked many times for such uttering by both Maddie and Rooster. \n\nRooster had his own reasons for going after Cheney. It so happened that this Cheney was an accomplice of Lucky&apos; Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall) and Rooster had some unfinished business with Ned. He recently had shot Ned in the lower lip during a confrontation but Ned had escaped. Now this chase provided Rooster with another shot at Ned. \n\nThe chase is beautifully picturized. Especially the final confrontation between Ned&apos;s gang and Rooster. The action sequence in this scene must be seen to be believed.\n\nThe reverberating and sweet music score by Elmer Bernstein forms an integral part of the plot. Glen Campbell has rendered the opening title song in his trademark voice. True Grit is a treat to watch for its believable depiction of the life and times of the West. Henry Hathaway, a specialist director of the crime, western and thriller genre has masterfully directed this flick. Re-uniting with Wayne after Sons of Katie Elder (1965), he has managed to extract the very best from his leading man. John Wayne has essayed the role of his lifetime. It is impossible to imagine anybody but him in the lead role as a tough, uncouth and drunken Marshall. Interestingly, Wayne won his only Oscar for this role in 1970."

The start of the movie provides already the thrill and as the story goes on, the thrill is more intense and provides the shattering effect the viewers needs to feel what the story implies. Apparently, the movie is very effective and it caters too to the majority class. It&apos;s not boring and it gives too the goose bumps!!!",

      "reviewBody": "We often watch world conflicts on TV and think they could never occur in our own country: we&apos;re too civilized to surrender ourselves to such brutal behaviour. This thought is one of many that haunts a group of Spanish peacekeepers in the embattled Serbian province of Kosovo. The troops represent a spectrum of personalities: the pacifist, the trigger happy, the professional soldier, the UN translator with conflicting loyalties, the soldier who wants no part of somebody else&apos;s conflict and who just wants to go home. As they undertake their duties - rebuilding a Church, restoring electricity to a town - the conflict becomes their reality. They are swept into it, and far from being the placid observers &amp; peacekeepers they think they ought to be, they now must fight for their own survival. They slowly begin to lose that veneer of civilization that they though only they possessed, the same patina these embattled locals once had, but lost long ago. The director based many of the stories on actual events as told to him by Spanish soldiers returning from the region. It is filmed in a very gripping and heavy way - drawing you into it all, along with the lost soldiers. It drew great acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival, 2002. For those who followed (or survived) the events of the last decade in the Balkans, it is a stark and honest portrayal that will leave many re-thinking the versions they may have formulated in their own minds, reading newspapers and watching TV, comfortable, in their own very civilized, and very insular, homes",

      "reviewBody": "I spent a day watching &quot;About Schmidt&quot;, with Jack Nicholson... and then the evening rambling through reviews, since my wife&apos;s perception of the ending differed somewhat from mine....\n\nConflict can often lead to enlightenment and discovery, but not so in the case of Warren Schmidt. In his case it leads to a life of complacency, denial, delusion, and passive-aggressive behaviors... and eventually, to a meaningless life of servitude devoid of passion or purpose.\n\nSince my wife and I are around the same age as the character, and we ponder the same issues of our lives, the film had more significance to us. I found the work to be a cinema-graphic piece of art laced with symbolism and dark humor (at best). I likened it to previous movies like &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, &quot;The Apartment&quot;, &quot;The Swimmer&quot; (Burt Lancaster), or a short filmed called &quot;The Bridge&quot;.\n\nAs a cautionary tale (or social comment) on the &quot;American Way&quot; of life, the messages it conveys are slightly exaggerated, but nevertheless there to be debated. We are talking about identity, achievement, interpersonal relationships, and the &quot;average IQ&quot;.\n\nIn the end, I believe this film will become one that is studied in future classrooms, and it was brave of Nicholson to participate in such a character study and a work intended primarily for writers, actors, and directors. If laughter is &quot;the sound we make when we are surprised (or shocked) by the truth&quot;, then the amount of humor you find in this film may be directly related to your own level of naivety or denial. After all, laughter can often be just another defense mechanism, right?\n\nSome movies are straightforward, some are magical, some are mystical, and then, some are symbolic. This movie falls into the last category. The use of time, space, cognitive dissonance, and Irony abound in this work and challenge us to look, think, and feel.\n\nNotes: we would have cut or altered the &quot;Percodan scene&quot; at the rehearsal (as overdone), also note- the cattle at the funeral who later appear on the freeway, inside jokes about Des Moines and Denver, Randall&apos;s &quot;Certificate of Attendance&quot;, the look on Jeannie&apos;s face at the end of Warren&apos;s speech at the Wedding Reception, the use of &quot;overstatement&quot;, details of wall decorations, and Warren&apos;s obvious attraction to the trite, idealistic, delusional, and superficial.\n\nIf you are a thinking, feeling, serious movie-lover, you should SEE this film once, and then STUDY it the 2nd time!",

      "reviewBody": "This was one of three fairly notorious &quot;Euro-Spy&quot; pastiches by the &quot;New Wave&quot; trail-blazer – assignments which he was forced to accept as director-for-hire after his more personal films did poorly at the box-office and even (unjustly) got cool reviews from the critics!\n\nAnyway, having watched quite a few substandard James Bond imitations over the years, Chabrol&apos;s involvement here certainly gave them a pleasant off-beat quality (not least in its settings, which include a wrestling ring, a flooded[!] hotel, a scrap-yard and even the opera house, where Stephane Audran appears uncredited as the soprano[!] unceremoniously stabbed in mid-aria). Conversely, I recall being underwhelmed (shocked, perhaps is the right word!) by MARIE-CHANTAL VS. DR. KHA (1965), the last to be released but actually the first one I watched, which was shown a few years back on late-night Italian TV; actually, although my original intention was to revisit it for this Chabrol retrospective, I had to bypass it – along with all the others that I was already familiar with – due to time constraints! Indeed, undergoing such a comprehensive Chabrol tribute entails that even apparently trivial fare deserves a nod as well – and I have to say that I quite enjoyed this one and (to a slightly lesser extent) its sequel AN ORCHID FOR THE TIGER (1965).\n\nThough star Roger Hanin (who also wrote them under a pseudonym!) could hardly offer Sean Connery competition as both action-man and stud, being beefy and all, he does alright by the former – especially as some of the fight sequences are rather violent for their time. Likewise, these being the famously uninhibited French we are talking about, the film uncovers much more female flesh (albeit entirely gratuitously) than the Bonds were ever allowed, then or now!! Incidentally, having mentioned 007, the luscious heroine of this one is FROM Russia, WITH LOVE (1963)&apos;s Daniela Bianchi – who, however, is given very little to do (her thunder stolen as much by Maria Mauban, playing the girl&apos;s attractive mother, as by Christa Lang, later Fuller, as the alcoholic &apos;dumb blonde&apos; moll of one of the film&apos;s myriad villains!).\n\nTypically, the plot (involving the signing of a deal relating to a new super-plane, or something: with the film atypically shot in black-and-white, the footage showing this &apos;weapon&apos; invariably recalls the opening moments of Stanley Kubrick&apos;s DR. STRANGELOVE [1964]!) is merely a &quot;McGuffin&quot; and, in fact, given Chabrol&apos;s predilection for Hitchcock, he clearly enjoys trying his hand at the spy comedy-thrillers for which the Master Of Suspense had virtually laid the template himself 30 years before.\n\nThe narrative features a couple of power-hungry factions who would just as easily double-cross each other as eliminate the hero in order to arrive at their goal: the most notable among the latter are the ubiquitous Mario David (funny how I had never heard of him before and now I see him turn up in one Chabrol picture after another!), sporting silver hair (thus anticipating Dirk Bogarde&apos;s Gabriel in Joseph Losey&apos;s equally-maligned-but-fun MODESTY BLAISE [1966]) and eventually eliminated via a much-hyped backwards-shooting gun that was also utilized by Dean Martin&apos;s Matt Helm in the similarly-spoofy THE SILENCERS (1966), and Jimmy Kharoubi who, as a midget, supplies the film&apos;s biggest laughs (especially when he dresses up in a kid&apos;s cowboy outfit to shadow our hero at an amusement park, attempts to strangle a much bigger man after hiding in a wrapped-up birdcage in his apartment, knocks at a door and is unseen through the peep-hole, and even asks the hero&apos;s side-kicks to lift him up so as to reach an all-important safe deposit-box at the airport!).",

It does seem a very strange mess of a movie if you browse thru it or happen to miss a scene while going to the bathroom, but I made myself pause it when I needed to and now I seem to get it!!!\n\nPart road trip, part romantic comedy, part wacky comedy, part fantasy, it&apos;s all about how the angel Gabriel (Dan Hedaya) is getting pressure from the Big Man Himself to arrange love matches that will actually last.\n\n Down on earth, oblivious to what&apos;s going on in heaven, a janitor named Robert (Ewan McGregor) has just been fired and replaced by a robot. His ruthless boss (a hysterical Ian Holm) refuses to even act apologetic about replacing hardworking men with mindless robots he doesn&apos;t have to pay. His reason completely gone, Robert kidnaps the spoiled princess daughter of his boss, Celine (Cameron Diaz) and hits the road with her, hoping to get his job, some money, or just an apology!!! \n\nThis is the kind of film which is perfect when you need something very fluffy and fun with no heaviness. There is some violence (one very funny scene involves Delroy Lindo forcing Robert to dig his own grave), but it&apos;s so funny and comedic that it&apos;s not going to fit in with the regular violence in movies, like in Die Hard or something.\n\nIt&apos;s a very delightful film for anyone who likes Ewan or Cameron. I think they had great chemistry and the whole movie was just pure fun!!!"

No! &quot;Fickende Fische&quot; is first and above all a love story among two 16 year olds with all the normal problems, and AIDS being &quot;just&quot; one of them. Getto and her young actors perfectly walk the narrow line between intimate feelings and unrelenting fate - and manage to make the viewer an intimate part of this relationship.\n\nJust as if we were one of the protagonists ourselves we feel our heart beat as they touch almost unknowingly for the first time; and feel with them each and every step of the following relationship.\n\n&quot;Fickende Fische&quot; is a small movie. One of those that ask the audience to become a 16 year old boy or girl and fall in love again - and to deal with AIDS not in an AIDS-movie, but tragically and comically at the same time in a little big love story.",

Rather, it&apos;s playful frivolity, and this spirit was hit perfectly by the movie. This also happened to be the mood most appreciated by the people in Germany&apos;s darkest years after the war. Yet even without those accentuating circumstances, the movie was great, with Strauss&apos; music, magnificent costumes, and - for that time - glorious color. One scene was often remarked upon, where Rosalinde, as part of her disguise, changes her hair from blond to red - on camera. In general, the movie played out more of the storyline than the original presents, which actually helped to make it clearer, and furthermore lent it an air of authenticity.\n\nThis movie, finished under the threat of the approaching Soviet Army, constitutes probably the high point of the old, well-oiled German film industry. When any German, who was of movie-going age in 1946, is asked thirty of even fifty years later, which film he remembers best from those years, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; is certain to come up. And thanks to the missing sensuality, youngsters like me under the age of eighteen were fortunately permitted to see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Find a Place to Die is a spaghetti western from director Giuliano Carmineo, who later on helmed the excellent giallo The Case of the Bloody Iris. This western is definitely less enjoyable than that thriller though. In it a woman seeks the help of a gun-fighter to avenge her husband&apos;s murder and to retrieve her stolen gold.\n\nIt&apos;s a fairly bog standard entry in the Italian western sub-genre with little to recommend it to anyone beyond spaghetti western fanatics. It is, however, graced by the presence of former Miss Italy Daniela Giordano, who appeared in a few interesting movies, most notably Mario Bava&apos;s fun sex comedy Four Times That Night. But she isn&apos;t really in this one enough, although she does feature in perhaps the most memorable scene in the film where she sings a song while strumming a guitar. This moment was at least a little different to the norm for these types of flicks but otherwise this one is business as usual spaghetti style. It&apos;s solid but nothing too great.",

      "reviewBody": "John Hough&apos;s horror films are a mixed bunch, but this one is far more interesting than its horrendous critical reception would suggest. It is ostensibly a detective story of a small town policeman (John Cassavetes) investigating a series of unusually vicious rape homicides.  Hough uses the structure to raise some provocative questions about penetration as violation.  Sex and violence as one, forged and bonded in repression, resentment, sadism and envy.\n\nThe film is riddled with hints of the incestuous desire the protagonist has for his daughter.  Hough thus plays with audience identification, seeking to implicate the viewer in a repulsive sexuality which, in a graphic morgue-table scene of a naked female cadaver, extends to incorporate necrophilia.  The otherwise conventional plot is spiced up by a contemplation of p.o.v. as moderating aberrant sexuality.  No wonder that critics and audiences found the film overly offensive and distasteful. Undeterred, Hough would treat similar themes in his equally maligned &quot;American Gothic&quot;.\n\nGraphic, contemplative and unrelenting in its bleakly oppressive visual style, this is a disturbing film experience: one of the more confrontational of taboo-breakers dealing with the always problematic theme of sexual homicide.\n\nIntriguingly enough, the film has some elements in common with Wes Craven&apos;s &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; released around the same time, and dealing with sex crime, isolated communities, deceptive innocence, female independence and role expectations, and the other-worldly demon, the Incubus."

It is a beautiful and youthful love story that involves rebirth (cosmic balance) as well. What to say about Nag, right from the roles as industrialist, rich landlord and as poor farmer he had immersed perfectly in these roles and has done a impeccable job. He did these roles with so ease like the way he has done for annamayya, ramadasu &amp; shirdi sai.He once again proved that he is a George Clooney of Tollywood.ANR&apos;s role is so pivotal in the movie, What can I say about him.100 years cinema History lo 70 years athanide. We should feel proud to have him. The scenes between, ANR, Nag &amp; Chaitanya are the best ever I saw. From the time ANR brought the industry to Hyd to Nag taking it further on to a new age cinema, this is what I called a great Journey. The only sad thing is ANR is not alive to see all this celebration. Thank you Vikram Kumar for showing us entire Akkineni Family in a single frame. There is a standing Ovation at the end in the theater I saw, which I doubt ever happens for a tollywood film. PS Vinod&apos;s brilliant cinematography and Anup Rubens&apos; background score are riveting. Lastly one thing I can say is a small, simple &amp; perfect cameo, debut from Akhil AkKineni. #ANRLivesOn #Manam #DejaVu #KingIsBack.",

If this film doesn&apos;t make you cry at the end- especially the bittersweet &quot;gift&quot; she receives- you are made of stone. Marie may be a tad hammy, but you believe her, none the less. I can see why she was a star.",

      "reviewBody": "Sydney J. Bartholomew Jr. should never be allowed to make another film again. How come people are giving budgets to people to make bad films when there are plenty of creative talented directors out there struggling to make their first feature?!\n\nThe only reason to buy/rent this film is if you think the Sprouse twins are too cute to pass on. Yes they are, and they don&apos;t disappoint here either. But trust me when I tell you, that is the only reason (and one other I&apos;ll mention in a moment)\n\nThe scenes are shabbily put together (everything looks rushed). They even used stills taken from the footage for coverage (UGH!). The music is crude with dialogue to match (this is little kid&apos;s entertainment?!)\n\nA good director would have noticed Cole mouthing Dylan&apos;s lines in a number of the scenes and given him some coaching. If he didn&apos;t pick this up on set, it definitely should have been spotted in the dailies? Their double-takes in the scene with Cobi Jones&apos; cameo were unbearable to watch. If I&apos;d have been on set... Well, never mind! Two ADs too! Didn&apos;t they have a creative brain cell between them?\n\nOne little gem I spotted in all of this mess was a young actor, Tyler Hervey. Look out for him if you watch this movie. Character is &quot;Mikey&quot; and he plays an angry cop&apos;s kid. Got wonderful on-screen presence and would be wonderful to see him in a major role.\n\nAnyway... Just for kicks gets 2/10.",

      "reviewBody": "What&apos;s it all about? (opening line from the original-movie 1966)\n\n&quot;Alfie&quot; is a remake of the 1966 British film that made an international star of Michael Caine. It takes a story very much associated with a particular time and place -- London in the swinging &apos;60s -- and successfully transplants it to modern-day New York City. The cockney lothario played by Caine has been turned into a working-class British émigré played by Jude Law, who makes Alfie a bit less cockney and a bit more self-aware.\n\nAlfie&apos;s a smooth talking Londoner in New York who does his very best to avoid succumbing to the dreaded &apos;c&apos; word commitment. Along the way, we&apos;re introduced to some of his ladies on the go  Dorie, Julie, Liz and Nikki, to name but a few. \n\nLike the earlier &quot;Alfie,&quot; it&apos;s the story of a sexually promiscuous man. Alfie (Law), a chauffeur, lives in a small Manhattan apartment and dedicates his life to seducing women. Talking directly into the camera, and preening with a self-satisfaction so complete as to seem a form of innocence, he expounds on clothes, the proper application of cologne and the various rules he employs in his libidinous pursuits. His goal, it seems, is to have sex with as many women as possible but to get close to none of them.\n\nEach one starts off as a fling, but somehow manages to influence Alfie&apos;s life. He slowly starts to realize that he is actually alone and that there is more to life than what he has done so far. \n\nLike the earlier &quot;Alfie,&quot; the new version could be called a cautionary tale, about a way of life that leads to the existential confusion embodied in the famous catchphrase, &quot;What&apos;s it all about?&quot; \n\nAnyone we know in it? Jude Law is fresh and funny as Alfie, with just the right amount of smug attitude. The stunning Sienna Miller is the beautiful but &apos;damaged&apos; Nikki, and Susan Sarandon sizzles as the sexy older woman, Liz. There&apos;s also Marisa Tomei (Julie), Nia Long (Lonette) and Omar Epps plays Alfie&apos;s best friend, Marlon.\n\nWould I recommend it? Definitely. Although remakes do not usually come through smelling of roses, this one does. It&apos;s fresh, colourful and funny. Jude Law is magnificent, introducing us to a slightly warmer side of Alfie than Michael Caine."

The confrontation of two different human kinds, the enterprising editor Fausto Di Salvio (Alberto Sordi) and his shabby book-keeper Ubaldo Palmarini, interpreted by an extraordinary Bernard Blier, is the main source of an intelligent and never ending comicality. The two protagonists reach Africa in search for Mr. Di Salvio&apos;s brother-in-law, Oreste Sabatini (Nino Manfredi), who disappeared in the Black Continent without giving news of himself anymore. The trip, full of unbelievable adventures, becomes also for the watcher the occasion to taste the beauty of an uncorrupted nature and to distinguish the true values of life from the silly and stressing habits of modern society. An elegant soundtrack signed by Armando Trovajoli is the perfect musical comment for this movie, skilfully directed by Ettore Scola, which confirms again his limpid talent of master of the Italian comedy."

Nazis used demonic hatred as their cornerstone belief and all the hysteria and the insanity and the cruelty of the Nazis is clearly observed in the lie-filled film.

But here there is as usual a problem with the language (being furthermore typical dialectal expressions), and also one with the political situation of those days between the West and the Comunist world. Aamof, the movie is divided in two parts: the first half is basically located in the same village and with the same rivalry as in the other movies of the series, while the second half changes completely setting and develops in a sort of mirror village beyond the &quot;iron curtain&quot; in Russia !!! One of the most amusing scenes in this film - and possibly of all the series - is the one related to the Don Camillo&apos;s &quot;hunger strike&quot; ... Many people among the youth may not recall the political climate of those days, between the western world and the East: there were attempts to make the peace, but there was also menace of a possible clash of titans with the threat of the &quot;bomb&quot;! ... This is why - maybe - some people don&apos;t catch all the nuances of this movie, and consequently find it difficult liking it ... I regret I can&apos;t help them, but I can assure you that - as an Italian - this is the one that likes me the most ... Zio Pino. PS. As already noted the title is completely misleading. Not only because Moscow has nothing to do with the story, but also because it completely misses the allusive intentions of the original one. A better solution would have been: &quot;Tovarisch Don Camillo&quot; or else &quot;Comrade Don Camillo&quot; and so on ...",

      "reviewBody": "Similarly to greatly renowned productions of Italian Neorealism that aimed at depicting the post-war reality in a convincing manner, this rarity of Polish cinema directed by Leonard Buczkowski appears to be a true surprise. Depicting the post-war period in the ruins of Warsaw, it surprises us with its realism and humor that, unlike many productions of the time, still create a desirable effect. Buczkowski, who made this film two years after famous FORBIDDEN SONGS supplies us with something different here but not at all less appealing. Bearing the same title as the famous silent classic by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, THE TREASURE offers a brilliant display of witty situations and satirical glimpse of society (not merely the society of the time).\n\nAn interesting note is how finely the film mocks the social drawbacks like greed, prejudice, jealousy and celebrates the values like honesty, youthfulness and determination. Let us have a brief outline of the content.\n\nA newly wed couple Krystyna (Danuta Szaflarska) and Witold (Jerzy Duszynski) are looking for a flat in the ruined Warsaw. As difficult as it may seem, the enthusiastic young husband finds a seemingly suitable flat to live. They desire privacy, no doubt about that. Luckily, they seem to have found it in a beautifully equipped flat owned by distinguished Honorata (Jadwiga Hojnacka). The silent witness of their joy is a little piece of paper where Witold notes...&apos;treasure&apos;...the spot where his treasure (his wife) will sleep. Yet, problems arise when it occurs that they are not at all alone and will never be left alone. There are more residents of the flat, some displaying exceptional humor, some highlighting suspicion, some depicting in-depth interest in what is going on. They seem to be individual phenomena to a certain moment...when it occurs to them that a &apos;treasure&apos; is hidden somewhere in the flat. The mutual quest combined with curiosity and greed will unite them...\n\nThe storytelling, as simple as it may seem, addresses certain values that have always been deeply rooted in the society. The witty, almost comical manner in which the movie develops that aspect may sometimes occur dated. Nevertheless, it never leaves a viewer totally indifferent to its gist. However, we can skip that point and see the film solely for performances where there is still much to be celebrated.\n\nThe characters are exceptionally clear, memorable and very convincing. They make the story vibrant and interesting. Danuta Szaflarska, the actress who has herself experienced the tragedy of war, does not resort to certain melancholy in her role but, like in FORBIDDEN SONGS, supplies us with a captivating portrait of a young wife with her dreams, desires, expectations. This role is very much alike the real Danuta Szaflarska with her ever present optimism and warmth. We feel the story with her. But, as an actress, she is never powerful alone and leaves much freedom to her co-star Jerzy Duszynski who portrays Witold. His determination becomes transparent in many scenes and an almost symbolic reference to the young generation - the eyes of the future. They are the couple of hope amidst the ruins of the old society. Among the supporting cast, a particular mention must be made of Adolf Dymsza who portrays Alfred Ziolko with excellent humor and some hilarious touches. His imitations of sounds, animals&apos; sounds long remain in the memory of the viewer. A great comedian! \n\nTHE TREASURE is a film highly worth seeing because it is far from any post war propaganda but rather depicts the difficult reality with a necessary element of humor that is a true &apos;treasure&apos; in our hands which always makes life more endurable. 8/10",

May&apos;s enduring creation was given the Max Fleischer special touch in this nostalgic cartoon. Johnny Marks&apos; infectious song leads into the well-known story of Santa&apos;s Winter weather troubles &amp; how the bullied little deer saved the day/night. A few of the graphics are reminiscent of Fleischer&apos;s splendid SUPERMAN series.\n\nThe cartoon adds some new details to the story - Mama Rudolph in a dress &amp; apron is a rather strange sight - but basically this version, narrated by Paul Wing, laid the groundwork for later adaptations. While rather obscure, if uncovered this would make a fine addition to a family&apos;s Christmas Eve viewing.",

This was the first film he was in after he won his Oscar and he proves it was not a fluke. He is absolutely chilling as a crazed cold blooded assassin who is out to kill the President. The only other actor who did a better job in this type of role is John Malkovich in In The Line Of Fire. This is a little known classic that really showcases Sinatra&apos;s acting talents. I think that this film and The Manchurian Candidate are the best films he ever made."

The relationship between the Turkish guests and the German hosts are idealistically depicted - the Germans love their Turkish hard-workers (if things are so happy, why Turkey has been time and again declined from joining the European Union?), the Turkish family is completely modern - like a normal Westernized family : they react tolerantly to their young daughter who gets pregnant from a non-German guy (no word on the common and prevalent honor-killings among the Turks in Germany, no word on arranged marriage which is also the very common among Turks in Germany, etc.) I&apos;ve been living many years in Germany, and the story this movie tells us is completely unconvincing.\n\nAs far as the artistic sides of the movie are concerned, it starts as a comedy and suddenly, with no seen reason, it turns into saccharine melodrama. The performance, the dialogs, the mimic and gestures reminded me of typical German TV commercials for Washing Powder, Yogurt, etc."

      "reviewBody": "By the early 70s, Mexican wrestler Santo was a huge figure in Mexican cinema. However, his formula of action and comedy that was very successful in his horror/action films of the 60s, began to take a campier, kitsch tone during the 70s. Taking away the previous mystical origins of Santo and with an huge influence of Bond films, &quot;Santo contra los Secuestradores&quot; (1973) started the trend of Santo as an special Interpol agent. The same year, &quot;Santo contra el Doctor Muerte&quot; followed up this trend and perfected it the style creating the now familiar image of the suave wrestler-by-day/agent-by-night that Santo carried during the 70s.\n\nThe plot starts as mysterious criminal (Antonio Pica), damages the famous painting &quot;Los Borrachos&quot; during its exhibition on a Mexican museum. Spain&apos;s government demands an investigation and soon the Interpol suspects that Dr. Mann (Georges Rigaud), the man hired for the restoration of the painting is in fact behind its damage. Since his wrestling tour will take him to Spain, Special Agent Santo is called to work incognito. With the aid of agent Paul (Carlos Romero Marchent) Santo will infiltrate in Dr. Mann&apos;s castle in Spain to discover the mystery behind the painting&apos;s&apos; damage, a mystery that involves the use of kidnapped women in bizarre scientific experiments.\n\nOwing a lot to the 70s bond films, the movie feels like an update to the Santo&apos;s character and a follow up to the humanization of his character. Santo is no longer the mystical warrior or the crime-fighting scientist, he is an Interpol agent who uses his status as Wrestling champion to make his work easier. Rafael Romero Marchent handles the Bond-style action genre competently even when his work had been mainly on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre.\n\nWhile not groundbreaking or particularly special, Rafael Romero Marchent makes a film that works despite its limitations and successfully mixes the Bond-esquire elements with the Santo mythology paving the way for the iconic figure Santo would become during the 70s. Like in his westerns, Romero Marchent makes good use of his locations and the film looks very good for its low-budget. Something very remarkable are the action sequences that, albeit short, work extremely well and are among the most realistic on a Santo movie.\n\nSanto looks more comfortable in this new take on his character than in his early films. He is now a less superhuman character and is relatively more believable than his previous incarnations. Carlos Romero Marchent is very good as Paul, but with the exception of some great scenes, the potential of his character is never exploited. Antonio Pica and Georges Rigaud are superb as the villains and they are probably among the best actors in the cast.\n\nAlthough not a kitsch extravaganza like the previous &quot;Santo contra la Hija De Frankenstein&quot;, the movie is entertaining and filled with Santo&apos;s light-hearted comedy (both voluntary and involuntary). The campy tone of the previous films is still here but the approach, as other aspects in the movie, is based on the style of Bond films. This may probably be a flaw as fans of Bond-style action films may not like the Santo elements and at the same time, fans of typical Santo films may feel like the Bond elements are not part of Santo.\n\n&quot;Santo contra el Doctor Muerte&quot; is definitely a love it or hate it movie. In my opinion the mix works and while it is not a perfect film it makes good entertainment for 95 minutes. 6/10",

If things regarding the delusional and irrational behavior of incest victim Millie Perkins had been more focused, the film would have benefited. As it is, the acting by Ms Perkins is convincing, and for a horror / psychological drama most of the acting is above average. The horror crowd will be disappointed, but those looking for the offbeat, will have found gold, with this twisted tale of hallucinations and mutilations. Special mention must be made of the poster art, which is outstanding. &quot;The Witch Who Came From the Sea&quot; is a bizarre oddity that has a limited, but devoted cult following. - MERK",

The script is wrought with hackneyed dialogue, predictable situations, and fan-boy in-jokes that serve to alienate most while entertaining few. But beneath all that is something you can&apos;t find in any Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster or Michael Bay monstrosity; genuine enthusiasm of storytelling. Every person involved in every element of this film clearly loved what they were doing. The sheer joy for the material leaps out of the screen and into the faces of the audience. You can&apos;t help but smile the whole way through this energetic and ebullient film. And for those of us to whom the film is directed, the current and former members of the cult of nerd, this film is a real treat.\n\nThe film is funny, not in the shocking way of a teenage sex comedy or the schmaltzy way of a romantic &quot;comedy,&quot; but in the same way that real life is funny. You laugh at this movie for the same reasons you laugh at your friend&apos;s bad jokes; the humor touches a nerve at the collective subconscious of all geeks.\n\nIf you are now or have ever been a nerd, geek, dork, or dweeb, do yourself a favor and find this movie. And if you aren&apos;t, see it anyway. You may catch yourself laughing along with the rest of us.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw &quot;Cowboy&quot; as a late night movie on television when I was a high school senior.   I really enjoyed the saga of how innocent, naive Chicago bell-hop Jack Lemmon becomes a man by way of his great adventure of driving a herd of cows from a Mexican ranch to the Chicago stock yards so that he can then swagger into the same Chicago hotel this time not as a bellboy in a monkey suit, but as a trail dust covered, gun tooting cowboy.    I enjoyed it so much that I took note of the TV Guide notation that &quot;Cowboy&quot; is based on what it termed the &quot;scandalous auto-biography of Frank Harris&quot;, the name of the character that Jack Lemmon plays in &quot;Cowboy&quot;.  I figured that the book was considered &quot;scandalous&quot; because of all the brutal experiences that Frank Harris had on the trail:  experiences which has the Glenn Ford character growling at Jack Lemmon,  &quot;You haven&apos;t gotten tough.  You&apos;ve just gotten miserable.&quot;  Therefore, when summer vacation arrived, I went to the public library and looked up &quot;Harris, Frank&quot; in their card catalogue.   (You see, kids, before there were computers, we used to look up things on rows of things called &quot;cards&quot; which were kept in these wooden pull-out things called &quot;drawers&quot; in a large furniture-like wooden thing placed in the middle of the library that was called a &quot;catalogue&quot;)   I found a card listing a book entitled,  &quot;My Life and Loves by Frank Harris.&quot;    But the book was not on a shelf, so I went to the front desk that Friday evening and innocently asked the ladies there if I could put a reserve on &quot;The Frank Harris autobiography&quot; for when it came back.   One of the ladies asked me,  &quot;What is the title?&quot; I was too embarrassed to say,  &quot;My Life and Loves&quot; so I shyly said, &quot;It&apos;s an autobiography.  Frank Harris.&quot;   The woman repeated,  &quot;But what is the title?&quot;  So I shrugged,  &quot;Well, the title is,  &apos;My Life and Loves&apos;&quot;   A younger woman in the cluster said like someone in a film noir,  &quot;We have that in the back&quot; and went to get it.   I kept wondering,  &quot;Why all this intrigue about the story of Jack Lemmon as a cowboy?&quot;\n\nThe young woman brought out a rather large, rather heavy volume which I signed out.   But instead of being the cowboy adventure story I had expected, it began with something like,  &quot;I remember my first sensual experience as being when I was 5 years old and I touched the calf of Mary Peterson in ....&quot;   It took some searching to find the short segment within Frank Harris&apos; some 900 pages of pornographic remembrances of every sexual experience he had ever had between the ages of 5 and 50, which had something to do with his one-time only escapade of joining up with a bunch of guys who went over the border to Mexico, stole some cows, and drove them north to make a few fast bucks."

      "reviewBody": "Period drama has long been a forte of the British cinema; prior to this one there had already been at least three excellent examples from 2009; &quot;Young Victoria&quot;, &quot;Dorian Grey&quot; and &quot;An Education&quot;. Traditional British costume drama has concentrated on the Victorian era and early twentieth century (roughly speaking 1837-1945), but Nowhere Boy, like &quot;An Education&quot;, is set at a rather later period, in this case the late fifties.\n\nThe film is about the adolescence of John Lennon, while he was at school and art college in Liverpool. Unlike his three fellow Beatles, who were all from working-class backgrounds, Lennon grew up in middle-class suburbia with his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George, who had raised him since he was five. He was the son of Mimi&apos;s younger sister Julia by her husband Alf Lennon (referred to in the film as &quot;Fred&quot;), but the marriage was not a success, and after Julia began a relationship with another man, Mimi took care of the youngster, then five years old. Julia did not reappear in Lennon&apos;s life until his teenage years when a cousin informed him that, contrary to what he had previously thought, she was still living in Liverpool, only a short walk from his home.\n\nThe film focuses on the influence these two very different women had on Lennon&apos;s early life. Although they were sisters, they had wildly contrasting personalities. Julia was a bohemian extrovert, liberal in her social views and keen to foster her son&apos;s musical and artistic talents. Mimi (actually christened Mary Elizabeth) may have shared a nickname with the heroine of &quot;La Boheme&quot;, but there was nothing bohemian about her. She was a strict disciplinarian who initially had little sympathy with John&apos;s musical aspirations and insisted that he get a &quot;proper job&quot;, although eventually she gave in and agreed to buy him a guitar.\n\nThe film also charts Lennon&apos;s musical development, including his first meetings with Paul McCartney and George Harrison (Ringo, of course, did not come onto the scene until a few years later) and the birth of The Quarrymen, the band which was later to become The Beatles. There is a vivid picture of the British music scene in the late fifties, a time when trad jazz and rock-and-roll seemed to be competing to become the music of the future. There was also a curious British musical form, skiffle (actually a revival of an earlier American variety of jazz) which was influential at the time; The Quarrymen started out as a skiffle band.\n\nThe film also captures the look of the period; although the late fifties were a time of increasing material prosperity, there was much about British life which had a drab feel about it, especially the clothes and the interior decoration schemes. There is a contrast brought out between Mimi&apos;s house, decorated in various shades of brown and cream, and the brighter colours of Julia&apos;s which look forward to the more garish tastes that were to predominate in the sixties. (I remember growing up in a house where the living-room combined dark green wallpaper with a bright orange carpet- hideous today, but unexceptional at the time).\n\nIt was not so long ago that Kristin Scott Thomas was playing romantic heroines in films like &quot;The English Patient&quot;; today, casting directors seem to see her as a middle-aged battleaxe in roles like Veronica Whittaker in &quot;Easy Virtue&quot;. Aunt Mimi at first seems like the bourgeois equivalent of the aristocratic Veronica, although she later shows that there is a gentler, more caring, side to her nature. (If Veronica Whittaker ever had a gentler side she kept it well-hidden, even from herself). Scott Thomas is even better here than she was in &quot;Easy Virtue&quot;, because the role she is playing is more complex. Anne-Marie Duff is also very good as Julia and Aaron Johnson as Lennon seems like a young star in the making. Johnson is perhaps rather more handsome than Lennon was in real life, but he is able to convey a real sense of what he must have been like, in part a rebellious tearaway whose idea of fun is going for a ride on the roof of a bus, part emotionally vulnerable youngster torn between loyalty to his carefree, fun-loving mother and to his aunt, the woman who had cared for him since he was very young. The title &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; is not just a play on the title of one of Lennon&apos;s best-known songs; it is also indicative of John&apos;s state of mind as he tries to reconcile these two influences on his life. Like his &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, he &quot;Knows not where he&apos;s going to&quot;.\n\nThe film&apos;s main appeal will probably be to those with an interest in The Beatles, although in my view it can also be seen as a moving coming-of-age drama which can be enjoyed by those who can&apos;t tell Lennon and McCartney from Rodgers and Hammerstein or from Gilbert and Sullivan. It contains not only some great music but also some great acting. This was director Sam Taylor-Wood&apos;s first feature film but it is a debut of which she (that&apos;s Sam as in Samantha, not as in Samuel) can be proud. 8/10",

This constantly gets in the way of their relationship, so she breaks it off. He realizes how much he misses her and takes drastic action -- offering to sell his Sox season tickets -- to prove his love. It all ends in some slapstick schtick on the field at Fenway Park. Fallon (I had to look up his name to remind me) lacks screen presence, although he might remind some of a junior Mike Myers. Barrymore is OK, if you can accept her in the role of a junior business exec whose biological time clock is fast running out. The two unfortunately lack any serious chemistry, and the movie is just a series of clichés. I gave it one more point that I might have due to a number of colorful character actors surrounding Fallon whenever the setting is Fenway Park, which it frequently is.",

      "reviewBody": "What saddens me most of all is how we fold reality into simple stories. It it isn&apos;t just movies of course, every political decision by anyone is based on fabricated but palatable reality. Its both the lesson of this movie and its own undoing because it breaks its only reason to be: that it is true.\n\nWe have things that happen. When these happenings involve humans, they are based on stories, stories about gods and tribes mostly. When we explain then to ourselves (by explaining to others), they go through further refinement and become more perfect as concise stories. And when Hollywood finally arrives, those already polished, but useless artifacts get further processed, strained and arranged to be not only stories we understand, but that work dramatically (so as to satisfy market forces).\n\nFew shapers of film stories are better suited to this than Mike Nichols. This film does work in enough of the basics, mostly carried by Hoffman&apos;s lines and delivery. But its reason to exist is that it somehow mirrors reality. And it does so far as showing a few dots, but the way they are connected is less fettered by truth than the necessity of having a clean package.\n\nIts all part of the great disappointment of filmmakers who have the ability to reach deep into souls and affect us, but who seem to merely be incessantly practicing.\n\nI believe it wouldn&apos;t be as easy for us to create fake realities if we didn&apos;t have all these attractive confections from Hollywood. (That same Hollywood that is the stuff of a similar fake reality: that it is &quot;liberal.&quot;)\n\nThe CIA doesn&apos;t care much for the permission or funding of Congress. The House isn&apos;t where the connection was in those days anyway. The business about Israel&apos;s participation was all wrong and involved South African complexities. The Texas motivations were profoundly stupid then as now in their God-centric notions of fate, and having nothing to do with the plight of refugees. Charlie Wilson is a dope. The Texas hussy had nothing to do with the story unless you ask her. The Agency did spend significant energy on the &quot;endgame&quot; to be flummoxed by successive administrations. The US had far less to do with Talibanizing than the Saudis and Pakistanis who arranged most of the weapons.\n\nBut who cares, if we can fantasize about the world being changed by a night of sex between Tom and Julia?\n\nThere are two good actresses here: Blunt and Adams. Their scenes matter. As with the Nichols formula, there&apos;s one breathtaking cinematic effect. We have our first shooting down of Soviet copters, set up expertly by introducing us to both evil mechanized Soviets and wildeyed Afgan idiots. A copter crashes in a narrow street and that street morphs to Amy Adams&apos; sexy legs, then her exaggeratedly sexy butt as we follow her, camera panning up to a redheaded ponytail perkily bouncing. She is on her way to report this joyful carnage. \n\nOh if we could only would reward this skill if it were turned to art instead of decor.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

Put your claws back in Catwoman, it&apos;s obvious who you are and what your motives are. Independent film-making is a challenge enough without public, slanderous comments like the fabricated comments from a hurt sole. \n\nThis film was beautifully shot on a combination of super 16 film and High Definition 24p. Both formats are high quality, preferred, formats for industry professionals and it shows because the film exhibits beautifully. The cinematographer clearly brings decades of award winning experience with him to this rich looking film. \n\nA few points about the film that cannot be disputed are: it is beautifully shot, the acting is tremendous - having earned two of the top awards from Outfest 2004 for &quot;Best Acting&quot; (and a third Outfest award for &quot;best narrative Lesbian feature&quot;), just about all audiences can relate to it for one reason or another (a clear fact once you&apos;ve been in an audience it has screened for) and, the sound and music quality are incredible. The film hasn&apos;t screened to an audience yet where at least a dozen or more people ask how to get a copy of the soundtrack. \n\nWithout a tremendous director, none of the above mentioned qualities come through in any film. \n\nCongratulations to a talented group of people for coming together to create a unique, award-winning film which is screening at festivals around the world and sure to land in the theaters and/or on the shelves of video stores for hungry audiences of sophisticated women and men (lesbian, gay, bi, transgender and straight) around the world."

      "reviewBody": "I have a feeling this isn&apos;t the only time that Cliff Robertson played the trans-Atlantic star beefing up a late British war movie for the US market. However, Cliff is NOT playing a British squadron leader! There were a large number of Canadian and Australian flyers in British squadrons during WWII. We also have the fleeting appearance in the movie of an Indian pilot. I suspect Cliff is representing a Canadian - though there were also a few US volunteers flying in the RAF in WWII (as late as 1944 and in a bomber I&apos;m not so sure about - but its not totally impossible!) The real casting problem is George Chakiris. Very Greek/Italian and not at all Norwegian in appearance or accent! Also he lacks the screen presence or acting ability of Robertson. Considering his sister&apos;s looks I can only assume that there was a Greek milkman in that Norwegian town in the 1930s! Maria Perschy looks suitably Norwegian (and stunning) and doesn&apos;t try too hard for an accent otherwise than educated English - which considering she was Austrian may well have been a very good thing! Oh but the film has real flying scenes of Mosquitos and a flying score to match the Dambusters March so its a film worth watching. The lack of CGI is a huge bonus (though it does present us with some very dodgy models in action and the memory they destroyed a few real Mosquitos making the film). It also has one of the most stirring old-fashioned closing lines in film history delivered as only Harry Andrews could.\n\nSo I&apos;d recommend watching it with critical facilities on &apos;mute&apos; - enjoy what&apos;s there to be enjoyed and ignore the rest of it!!!",

Roy Grant&apos;s 633 squadron is assigned the task, and Bergman plans a ground attack to coincide with the air strike, but he is captured and tortured by the Gestapo.

It somewhat follows the line of the real story but to make it it&apos;s own it is a little different.  The Phantom actually looks a little like Fabio with his long blonde hair.  He plays a very devilish character.  I thought at first that this a very old rendition of the movie but when I had searched forever to figure out which one it was, it was the most recent one made.  I like the bit of extra sexuality they threw in it. It adds more of a reality to the characters and their feelings for each other.  It is sort of like a tacky Italian version but that&apos;s what makes it good.  I really liked this version of the movie and I suggest people watch it.  Again, remember that it is not like the musical in every way, it is different, but it is still good!  People need to get off the bandwagon of every Phantom movie made has to follow exactly like the musical, if they were all like that, then there would only be one made, this is why they make several, different versions makes watching each one interesting to see what will be different."

      "reviewBody": "Walter Brennan stars as Judge Roy Bean, the legendary self appointed law west of the Pecos in Texas. He uses whoever happens to be in his saloon as a jury, and the penalty of death is often dispensed for killing or stealing the animals of others.\n\nAt this time Cole Harden (Gary Cooper) is brought to the judge for stealing a horse. Cole claims he bought this horse, although he admits the person he bought it from may have stolen it from the original owner. The judge is not impressed, and he can tell neither is the jury. So while the jury deliberates, Cole makes conversation with the judge, figures out he is obsessed with British actress Lillie Langtry, and talks about the time he met her, and about the lock of her hair that he has back in El Paso. Then the jury comes back with the expected guilty verdict. The judge defers Cole&apos;s sentence until he can look into matters more, since he says that no friend of Lillie Langtry could be a horse thief. Plus Bean really wants to hear more of Cole&apos;s tales of meeting Lillie Langry, and he really wants to see that lock of hair. Later, luck would have it that the actual horse thief wanders into Judge Bean&apos;s bar. When Cole shows that he still has the sixty dollars that he paid for the horse on him, there is a shootout and Bean shoots the actual thief dead, freeing Cole.\n\nWhat I just described is the best part of the film. And I really haven&apos;t spoiled anything by telling you this since the art of it is in Brennan&apos;s and Cooper&apos;s delivery and the chemistry that they had together. But because an entire feature film is needed, there is a significant subplot about the judge being pro cattleman and thus backing people who sabotage the farming homesteaders nearby. This subplot is not that compelling and neither is the romance between Cooper&apos;s Cole and one of the daughters of the homesteaders, played by Doris Davenport. Davenport wasn&apos;t a very interesting actress, and she had only one other credited role the same year this film came out before leaving acting entirely.\n\nI&apos;d say watch it for probably the best thing Walter Brennan ever did and the great chemistry he had with Gary Cooper, but that the rest of the film, when Cooper and Brennan are not interacting, can be a bit of a bore.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;EVERYTHING MUST GO&apos;: Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nWill Ferrell tries his hand at more serious comedy-drama again (after the likes of 2006&apos;s &apos;STRANGER THAN FICTION&apos;) with this tale of a relapsed alcoholic who loses his job and wife on the same day and resorts to living on his front lawn. It&apos;s based on the short story &apos;Why Don&apos;t You Dance&apos; by Raymond Carver and is written and directed by first time filmmaker Dan Rush. It co-stars Rebecca Hall, Michael Pena, Stephen Root, Laura Dern and Christopher Jordan Wallace (the son of Faith Evans and the late rapper &apos;The Notorious B.I.G.&apos;) in his second film. The movie is funny as well as depressing and emotional. It&apos;s a nice step in Ferrell&apos;s career, for exploring broader range.\n\nFerrell plays Nick Halsey, an alcoholic who&apos;s recently fell off the wagon. As the film opens he&apos;s fired from his job for apparently having an affair with a new employee and then left by his wife for the same reason. He&apos;s also locked out of his home (after his wife changes the locks), with all of his belongings left on the front lawn. His credit cards have all been canceled as well and his company car is repossessed by his former employers. With no money and no place to go he decides to camp out on his front lawn with all his stuff. His neighbors complain of him being a public nuisance though and he&apos;s reported to the police. Thanks to city law his cop buddy Frank (Pena) is able to give him five days to hold a yard sale before he has to kick him off the property. While trying to sell his stuff Nick befriends a new neighbor across the street (Hall) and a local neighborhood kid (Wallace).\n\nLike I said the movie is surprisingly dramatic for a Will Ferrell movie and he pulls off his performance impressively. The material isn&apos;t too much of a stretch for him given that it&apos;s still pretty comedic but it&apos;s definitely honest and set in reality (unlike the majority of his films, which are mostly slapstick) and there&apos;s some pretty hard hitting drama at times as well, especially towards the end. The movie still has a sizable amount of laughs though so traditional Ferrell fans shouldn&apos;t be disappointed. That&apos;s why the movie is the perfect step for Ferrell (to test out his range). A gigantic leap in to serious drama would be to sudden and the film works perfectly as is. A smart move for Ferrell and a decent film results because of it.\n\nWatch our review show &apos;MOVIE TALK&apos; at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEq_X_axUaU",

I have many memories of director Powell flying around in a rather unusual aircraft for the time, a helicopter. Being very young, I didn&apos;t have much interaction with the adults as they wanted to imbibe after the shootings for the day but I do recall having to be silent and not play in the front of the business. This is truly a unique story line for the early &apos;50s. The cold war was in full swing so any movie about this subject captured audience attention. I have since purchased video tapes for members of my family. Excelent example of the A-Bomb era genre. Others: The Day The Earth Stood Still, Godzilla."

The rest of the cast does not reach the same levels (with these 2, the challenge is not easy) and the choice of the leading actress did not convince me as a 18y young girl. The scenario is so so, but still displays Pagnol love for simple, modest people.",

Allen, obviously pretty unskilled in most everything, decides that he can do just what the title of the film says and achieve true happiness with his one true love. Documentary-styled footage makes the picture unfold in a quietly uproarious way as Allen uses corny techniques used by most news organizations to tell a story that would have looked very odd without his insight being involved. Allen&apos;s films only work because he makes them work usually and that is definitely the case with &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;. Once again he shows unlimited potential and would use this movie, more than any other, as a spring-board for much future success in the 1970s, 1980s and beyond. 4 stars out of 5."

Unable to concentrate in school, he has long dropped out. Despite his intelligence and above-average vocabulary, jobs are unavailable. So, using a toy pistol, he sticks up an armored car and takes off with a sack of quarters which spill all over the street she runs.

Although Hollywood has been critiqued in film before in similar ways, memorable scenes, clever dialogue, quality acting, and a surreal plot and setting, add together to make this an unusual and different film. Maybe another viewing might add a different dimension. This is by no means &apos;light entertainment&apos; and it leaves plenty of questions unanswered. But on the whole, an intelligent movie, if something of an enigma. My vote 7/10",

It&apos;s not my favourite Christmas film by any stretch but I enjoyed watching something a little bit different but still had lots of Christmas magic within.\n\nIt&apos;s very much an action/adventure/Christmas film all rolled into one. The storyline centres on the main characters quest to locate and return Santa Clause after he is kidnapped. Lots of adventure and jokes along the way. Some hit and some miss!\n\nLike all Christmas films of this nature, just enjoy it for what it is. These types of movies should never be about real life but just immerse yourself for 2 hours in a world of action and magic.\n\nOverall, a solid 7 out of 10 for me. Not the best or worst film I&apos;ve seen but for this time of year it is certainly one I&apos;d recommend.\n\nBut as I always say, don&apos;t worry about reviews! Everyone will see the same thing differently. Go and make your own mind up.",

      "reviewBody": "Cary Scott (Jane Wyman) is a middle-aged, wealthy woman whose husband recently died. Ron Kirby (Rock Hudson) is Cary&apos;s younger, independent-minded landscape gardener. Ron reads Thoreau, respects nature, and values simplicity and honesty. Cary and Ron are attracted to each other. For Ron, marriage to Cary is an easy decision. But for Cary, the decision to marry Ron is harder. She must confront the disapproval of her grown children, and the disapproval of friends whose materialistic, country club values are inconsistent with the values of Thoreau.\n\nIn a town where people know each other&apos;s business, tongues wag. Feelings get hurt. Conflict erupts. The film&apos;s subdued lighting and vivid colors, combined with soft piano and velvety violin background music, create a tone that is sad and sentimental. Viewers are right to say that this Douglas Sirk directed film is a melodramatic soap opera.\n\nThinly veiled behind the simple plot, however, lies a profound message: &quot;to thine own self be true&quot;. It is a message totally out of sync with 1950&apos;s America. Yet, the message would surface a decade later as the 1960&apos;s youth mantra: &quot;do your own thing&quot;.\n\nAs an archetype, Ron seems too pure. And Cary&apos;s children and friends, shallow, selfish, vain, gossipy, and judgmental, are easy to dislike. This sharp dichotomy is somewhat unrealistic. But it gets the point across. And that point is a blistering indictment of 1950&apos;s American materialism and mindless conformity.\n\nThe film was thus ahead of its time. Despite its high technical quality, it was snubbed by the Oscars. In retrospect, &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; is superior to all five of the Oscar best picture nominees from that year. And its message is just as relevant now as it was fifty years ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Before Austrian film director Michael Haneke got well-recognized and appreciated in the international film circuit with such films as &quot;Code Unknown&quot;, &quot;Time of the Wolf&quot; and &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; (all of which were made in France and shown in Cannes), he already made his mark with a number of films made in his native Austria, one of which is this film called &quot;71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance&quot;(1994). This work is the third installment in the director&apos;s &quot;glaciation trilogy&quot; (the other two being &quot;The Seventh Continent&quot; and &quot;Benny&apos;s Video&quot;), thus called because of the central theme of the fine line between barbarism and civility in modern urban life being completely, hopelessly blurred. The &quot;barrier&quot; has been broken, so to speak.\n\nAs the title suggests, the film consists of 71 &quot;fragments&quot; or vignettes, seemingly random, unrelated and mundane, of various characters going through the motions and vagaries of daily existence in urban Austria. But one can sense that this only seems to be so, as the film&apos;s prologue suggests that this is the event that will loom over the succeeding &quot;fragments&quot;. And that is, the 1993 Christmas Eve reckless shooting done by a 19-year-old student named only as Maximillian B. inside a bank and on the streets, before eventually shooting himselfone that is purportedly based on a real-life incident.\n\nNo explanations or back-stories are provided to the characters and their situations being shown &quot;episodically&quot; on the screen (a Romanian boy refugee, a bank delivery man, an old pensioner, a childless couple and, of course, the student himself). More often than not, a specific fragment is abruptly interrupted or ended by a black fade-out (an alienating technique Haneke once again utilized in the equally visceral and demanding &quot;Code Unknown&quot;). Some fragments happen for not more than a minute, while some last for as long as five or even eight minutes (notably the scene where the student practices ping-pong tennis facing an automated opponent and the scene where the old pensioner argues with his daughter over the phone, both of which vividly displaying a whole gamut of simmering emotions without ever resorting to histrionics). Even reinforcing the clinical, cold approachfor which Haneke is really knownis the utter lack of an accompanying soundtrack and the wordlessness of some scenes.\n\nThe sense of dread is punctuated by the ever-present television (as is the case in the two other films in the trilogy), from where a specific world news is being broadcast (like the ethnic war in Somalia and the child abuse charges against pop star Michael Jackson). This is as if to suggest that the looming event foreboded at the film&apos;s start is itself to become a subject of a TV news coverage which, albeit small in scale when compared to the news indicated above, is nevertheless not without a lasting cost to the human lives involved, physically, emotionally and psychologically. Having said this, how has the line separating civility and barbarism come to be completely violated in this thought-provoking film?\n\nThe trigger shooting perpetrated by the young student, which serves to be the film&apos;s denouement, appears to have been done for no apparent reason at all. It&apos;s senseless killing in its purest meaning (which arguably is the underlying essence of the middle-class family&apos;s suicide in &quot;The Seventh Continent&quot; and the teenage boy&apos;s videotaped murder of the girl in &quot;Benny&apos;s Video&quot;). And this is what makes the act all the more chilling. It&apos;s as if to suggest that such a self-destructive act is inherent in everyone of us, if not what makes up our essence, waiting only to be brought to the surface by a seemingly random and inconsequential spate of events (in &quot;71 Fragments&apos;&quot; case, it&apos;s to be rooted in the student&apos;s lack of enough cash to pay for his car gas).\n\nAnd when the &quot;event&quot; does finally happen, rather than to serve as an important food-for-thought, it&apos;s sadly reduced to no more than a piece of media sensation, regarded as the hot &quot;news of the day&quot;, focusing more on &quot;what&quot; happened than on &quot;why&quot; did it happen. The alarming incident thus becomes another piece of media entertainment, to be savored by mass consumers who always crave for what is sensational and controversial, without ever thinking of its deep-rooted incitations and implications. (This is a thought which Haneke is to delve full-blown in &quot;Funny Games&quot;, both the Austrian and American versions, though I really prefer the first one.)\n\nIf in Polish auteur Krzysztof Kieslowski&apos;s world, chance incidents and fateful encounters are all part of a grand design to convey deep layers of human emotional truths (like in the truly majestic &quot;Three Colors&quot; trilogy), in Haneke&apos;s (or at least in the world of &quot;71 Fragments&quot;), such randomness is to be put in order by an inherent barbarism that&apos;s only barely creeping out of the human psyche.",
