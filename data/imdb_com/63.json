      "reviewBody": "While Stan and Oliver sit at home eating dinner they get a letter from Oliver&apos;s mother with a picture of them with their twin brothers. Deciding it best to keep their brothers a secret from their other halves, they burn the picture. Unbeknownst to them though, these very twins have just arrived in town on a boat. Albert and Bert are not the smartest though and, before hitting the town, they allow Chief Engineer Finn to take their money to &quot;invest&quot; it. This means that they have no real cash when they go ashore to deliver a valuable ring for the captain. However when they meet two young ladies with expensive tastes they find themselves in a bit of a pickle.\n\nThe old &quot;twin brothers/mistaken identity&quot; plot is hardly the stuff of narrative gold, so I was a bit concerned that the plot would be terrible with this film. However this is actually very precisely structured for a Laurel and Hardy film and, although the plot is hardly convincing, it is very neat and tidy and moves along well. Even if the plot had been poor though, it is the laughs that matter and this film consistently delivers amusing moments even if it doesn&apos;t have much in the way of standout scenes. I was tickled all the way through it rather than roaring with laughter but this gentle humour was still enough for me.\n\nLaurel and Hardy are both good but they weren&apos;t totally themselves. Laurel enjoyed his usual character but Hardy was given fewer withering looks which is a shame as he does them so well. Finalyson has a bigger role than normal but really I felt him more effective in short film roles that relied on his physical work rather than his delivery. Hale is enjoyable as the waiter, while Housmann is a good drunk.\n\nOverall a solid and enjoyable Laurel &amp; Hardy film that is a pretty tight production by their standards. Not the funniest vehicle you will find for them but certainly more than enough to please their fans."

Four of us watched it and agreed that it was interesting, unique and original, but also rather dull. The story is a stereotypical (but very decent) fantasy fairy-tale, with the very interesting added element of the &quot;stringed puppet reality&quot;. It worked very well, with a quite serious and emotional story a bit reminiscent of Gormenghast - all immensely well produced. But it wasn&apos;t engaging enough to maintain that much enthusiasm in the viewer. It was a bit too dark to be for children, and somewhat too, I dunno, uninvolving to be for grown-ups. I appreciate it as an honest, very competently produced fantasy movie with a detailed and good-looking but also quite crude and limited universe.\n\nI do think it would be more engaging on the big screen than on a TV screen, because I was slightly bored through much of it. Granted, I was a bit tired when we watched it, and this is not a movie one should watch while tired. But it was a very interesting experience.\n\n7 out of 10.",

Also, the acting was terrible, how anyone justifies putting the time in to do something like this and then some other jerk justifies buying it and then some idiot at Rogers justifies putting it on the air? I don&apos;t know. To the actors of this film, take some acting lessons and dig deep, because the audience deserves it. Acting is not easy and if you think you&apos;ve done it here, you should probably quit. The whole thing is terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I could not even get past the first ten minutes. Michael Madsen is a good actor, but even the editing and shot selection made him look kind of weak."

Generally polite, the interviewers sometimes get condescending when the general public mistakenly assumes that the LDS still follows its original doctrine.\n\nOverall, this film better serves to highlight the fallacy of composition common in Mormon entertainment. Unoriginal, boring, and providing nothing more than another example of the blindered existence of a very deluded cult in the desert.",

If you find unbelievable things like a fat woman needing a rope to get out of bed funny this movie may be for you. Although I suppose that could have been for her MS too not at all clear /neither is funny. \n\nAlso early on it became obvious that they were using doubles for the nude scenes and ridiculous stuffing under the main actress&apos;s dress for the face scenes (seeing an implausible lumpy looking fat person in every other frame was supposed to be hilarious?)\n\nAnyway about half way through I realized it was a complete dud about the time the multicultural feel good stuff started to spin. The old man at the nursing home masturbating didn&apos;t help things along either---how riotously humorous eh?\n\nThis thing is as boring and colorless as the winter sky in Northern Europe--at least as depicted in this movie. Germany is one my favorite countries this movie makes Berlin look like some sort of future dystopia.\n\nThe scenery was so drab and dreary I can&apos;t even give it my usual extra star for a foreign venue.\n\nEven if you look at this thing as a character study movie rather than a comedy what character do we have? A woman who thinks a positive attitude changes every bad thing that can happen? It flops. Dull and boring like the character&apos;s life. The staged fake feel good PC multicultural stuff is like adding a root canal to this thing.\n\nAchtung! Avoid!!!!",

It&apos;s Tyrone Power in the role of his life and the tragedy of an ambitious circus apprentice becoming a con artist and gradually turning into a pseudo-religious guru. Both director Edmund Goulding (Grand Hotel, Dark Victory) and writer W.L. Gresham committed suicide, and one can smell suicide in this gem of a film, that is the story of the embezzlement of a gift. That circus operates as a good metaphor of the B-system Hollywood of the 40&apos;s, where geeks worked side by sided with geniuses. The tarot cards foresee the worst: there&apos;s a geek in every man&apos;s soul, no matter how big one can be, a downfall no imposed `happy ending&apos; can hide.  In this nightmare populated by fun-fairs, alcoholism and eccentric millionaires obsessed with the deceased, the film version makes use of the essential from the source novel and provides the best invention: an unscrupulous psychiatrist who records her patients on tape and then blackmails them, a device that Brian de Palma himself would have be proud of."

Jan-Michael Vincent did an excellent job too, even though his age is really starting to show in this film, but he did have a motorcycle accident the day before they started filming, at times in the film, you can actually see his hospital band believe it or not!  Jan-Michael Vincent, dominated this film, just like all his others!  Since now that his age is really kicking in, he makes a perfect bad guy or a psycho path (Hidden Obsession).  I recommend this film to all Hollywood B-movie fans!",

You really do have to wonder if this cameraman was simply returning to the studio after a day&apos;s work and decided to start filming and it ended up being released. There&apos;s certainly nothing too special to be seen here but it&apos;s interesting seeing the old advertising boards as well as the various houses. I think people from Brooklyn would get a kick out of seeing what the neighborhood used to look like. There&apos;s not too much entertainment purpose to be had from this film but fans of early cinema will at least find it fascinating."

Opening with Carlo Maria Cordio&apos;s endless credit title music (oddly reminiscent of Star Trek The Next Generation), we&apos;re then sold the aesthetically pleasing locations of the Mediterranean&apos;s Malta and Gozo. However, the sunny visuals take away from Iron Warrior some much needed atmosphere. Nevertheless, Brescia&apos;s Italian production doesn&apos;t shy away from brief nudity, some Lucio Fulci inspired make up and shock moments.\n\nBrescia while disregarding Ator&apos;s established character origins (in Ator Flight of the Eagle (1982) and Ator 2 - L&apos;invincibile Orion, released in America as The Blade Master 1984)) at best offers stylised 80&apos;s bold geometric shape makeup, and fan blown hair with vibrant costumes, reds, greens and flowing material passing the camera. There&apos;s a handful of beautiful women thrown including Iris Peynado, notable is the stunning Princess Jana, actress Sabina Gersak. Offering a poor mans Conan swordplay. There&apos;s Superman (1978) Krypton-like prison rings trapping a witch, with Ator played again by Miles OKeeffe, a chiseled lean He-Man, along with nemesis Trogar (Franco Daddi) a Skeletor meets with Action Force&apos;s Destro type sword wielding nemesis. He employs slow-motion, sped up film, wide shots and old Bewitched/Randall and Hopkirk vanishing editing tricks. The avant-garde mix of student-like experimental film elements is endless.\n\nIf theatrical, over the top, choppy Italian sorcery fantasy salami is your thing, Iron Warrior is a must see."

The characters are exchangeable (but then again, what slasher movie has great characters in them? Exactly!) and the death scenes are not overly inventively (not in my book anyway).\n\nWhat stays is a nice setting/atmosphere and an extra point for trying. Russian movies that are successful outside their homeland were mostly movies that are thoughtful (Solaris et al). Recently of course there was some Fantasy (Nochnoy Dozor aka Night Watch for example) and here we have a slasher. Nice for a try, but nothing to get too excited about.",

      "reviewBody": "A fascinating idea from Humphrey Jennings, to take a baby boy as representative of a nation soon to face massive decisions, is scuppered by the misguided choice of E.M. Forster as author of the narration.\n\nYoung Timothy proved to be incapable of holding the interest throughout a fairly long film, so other representatives were drafted in: a miner, a farmer, a train driver and a fighter pilot, to create an overwhelmingly masculine vision.\n\nBut not heroic. Forster&apos;s prose might have made a brilliant essay, but his Bloomsbury condescension and contempt for his fellow Britons, particularly the bourgeoisie and the working class, seems glaring in the democratic medium of film. He seems to regret that these very Britons being celebrated were on the verge of winning the war - consistent with his pessimistic statement in &apos;Two Cheers for Democracy&apos; that &quot;if fascism wins we are done for, and that we must become fascist to win.&quot;\n\nThe spectacularly downbeat section where the terrible defeat at Arnhem is juxtaposed with Myra Hess playing Beethoven&apos;s Appassionata sums up Forster&apos;s attitude. His internationalism may seem far-sighted and principled from a distance, but was this a message that needed to be drummed so unsubtly into his audience (many of whom would have been bereaved in battles such as this) at this particular time? &quot;If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country&quot;, as he famously remarked in &apos;Two Cheers&apos;. Well, if I was faced with such a difficult choice, I hope I would be less dogmatic about it than E.M.\n\nThe narration, contrary to the opinion of most of the other reviews, is terribly ill-judged. Declaimed in a gloomy monotone by Michael Redgrave, the viewer is left with the impression of moral equivalence between the allies and the Nazis. The hope represented by Timothy, that the form of the film forces Forster however reluctantly, to concede, is a slender thing indeed."

      "reviewBody": "The silvery Packard convertible Brian Donlevy drives is one of the most beautiful cars I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s basically all I&apos;d remembered from years ago when a local a cable channel that no longer shows old movies ran a bad print of this from time to time.\n\nDonlevy is not an exciting actor but he is fine. He plays an industrialist madly in love with his wife, who is not worthy of his devotion (to say the least.) She is played by Helen Walker, a specialist at cold, intelligent, sleek women. (She&apos;s the best part of &quot;Nightmare Alley.&quot;) We also have Charles Coburn as a detective and Ella Raines as a girl who wants to help cuckolded Donlevy out of a predicament I can&apos;t reveal. (But remember: This is a film noir.) In her early scenes, Raines smiles too much and looks like an ad for gum. (And speaking of ads, yikes! This has one of the earliest examples of product placement: Someone offers Donlevy a Coke and for quite a while, in the foreground, is a Coca-Cola machine!) Also on hand is Mae Marsh as Walker&apos;s mother. She looks great and is very good. And Anna May Wong, one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest, most poorly used stars, is fourth-billed as Donlevy and Walker&apos;s maid.\n\nThe movie is not exactly suspenseful but it&apos;s a solid piece of work. The acting ranges from good to excellent and the plot, though it wanders a bit from time to time, is intriguing. It&apos;s also unusually literate: The characters speak in impeccable (though never stilted) English.",

The teddy bear siblings, with the help of Flashy the flashlight and Charlie the compass, tried to give the two children who own them, Suzy and Tom, a Merry Christmas by bringing them a Christmas tree to the cabin where the family is staying because of the heavy snowfall. So that&apos;s all I could tell you. Spoilers, you know. You might have to watch it on YouTube or on video if you have it.\n\nAgain, I found this special criminally underrated! I mean that the next generation of kids, including my young nephew, should watch these for Christmas. Anyway, I love this wonderful Christmas special, and I wish it was on DVD, so I could share it with my nephew.",

The film refreshingly starts with a brief history of math and the philosophical stances of both characters on the subject. Then the first murder occurs, with of course the use of a symbol that begs the assistance of Professor Seldom and Martin in the police case.\n\n&quot;The Oxford Murders&quot; is good because it uses actual math and consistent logic. One of their only deviations is the use of Bormat&apos;s Last Theorem instead of Fermat&apos;s Last Theorem but that is just to keep in line with its fictional characters. There were perhaps a few too many twists but it was well enough written that most of them probably could have been predicted.\n\nIt plays out exactly like an old-fashioned murder mystery and set in compelling Oxford University. Like old-fashioned murder mysteries, there is no violence or gore but has a liberal use of profanity and sexual nudity (but Wood and Leonor Watling are very attractive so that&apos;s not an issue). I enjoyed the use of math and logic in &quot;The Oxford Murders&quot; and will likely search out future films from the writers and director.",

      "reviewBody": "Crank 2: High Voltage practically begs to be passionately loathed by absolutely everyone, with the notable exception of antisocial teenage boys. Its rank, nihilistic tone is relentless and exhausting. The misogyny is benchmark horrendous. The acts of violence are brutal, frequent and often blatantly homoerotic. Its flippant. Its homophobic. Its vulgar. And it feels as much seething contempt for its own narrative coherence as it does for its few prominent female characters.\n\nBut there is something bracingly brilliant about it. Films this fearlessly unhinged simply do not get made any more, and thirty years ago this would&apos;ve played, late at night, to packed houses for years on end, perhaps aptly bundled with the likes of John Water&apos;s Pink Flamingoes.\n\nOne fact that was suggested by the first Crank is set heroically in stone barely five minutes into its sequel - that directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor appear to be completely obsessed with pornography. There is a truly jaw-dropping amount of flesh on constant display, and the film&apos;s only female speaking parts belong to a prostitute and a stripper. This lends the film an air of uncomfortable, almost lavatorial sleaziness, until a bunch of actual porn stars turn up in the middle of a scene, starring as a bunch of disgruntled porn stars striking for better pay. Although it hardly passes as satire, it does seem like a sly dig in the direction of the producers that populate the Hollywood mainstream, who&apos;d surely relish the opportunity to make films like this if only the bastard machine would let them. Balls-out exploitation it may be, but if any film lives up to cinema&apos;s ancient adage of providing its audience with relentless sex and violence, its this one. \n\nThe second half of the film is where it really flies, and chooses to disregard not only its own plot, but any care for the patience or expectations of its audience. It goes, essentially, mad. And for something that was clearly deranged in the first place, it&apos;d be foolish for me not to offer up the only advice that will enable you to see exactly what I mean. \n\nGo and see it.",

Many gripping moments of self-realization, facing reality and appreciation for life and death.  The depth of relationships, self-sacrifice and lessons learned leaves the audience with a lot to process.  Overall, very inspiring and well-made.",

      "reviewBody": "Just for the record, I haven&apos;t read the novella this is based on, though I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s much better than this movie. As a movie alone, it&apos;s a very fun sci-fi thriller that looks downright incredible. It&apos;s some of the best sci-fi movie set design I&apos;ve seen, and the movie doesn&apos;t waste a centimeter. The story is basically about the implications of telekinesis, and uses the Alien &quot;trapped-onboard-a-spaceship-with-malignant-force&quot; set-up to exploit it (with much &quot;sturm und drang&quot;). The film has very well-drawn characters, like the loose-cannon telekinetic (Michael Des Barres), the wistful, elderly professor (John Standing) whose search for the mythical Volkind (itself a pity case from his colleagues) is the reason for the mission, and especially Royd (Michael Preed), whose unique, reclusive existence on the ship offers the main thrust of the story. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi and obscure cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Das Sams&quot; is based on an absolutely brilliant series of four children&apos;s books by Paul Maar.  When I saw it in the cinema, my eleven - year - old nephew as well as all the other kids in the audience really got a kick out of it.  Personally though, being somewhat more mature than the target audience and a seasoned cineast to boot, and not least because I literally grew up with the original books and the audio play, I must admit that the film didn&apos;t fulfill all my expectations.  I would have liked the film to have a slower pace, to focus more on the main characters rather than hustle from scene to scene;  especially so as Eva Mattes (as &quot;Frau Rotkohl&quot;) and especially Christine Urspruch (as &quot;das Sams&quot;) put in brilliant performances -- Ulrich Noethen (&quot;Herr Taschenbier&quot;), August Zirner (&quot;Herr Oberstein&quot;), Armin Rohde (&quot;Herr Mon&quot;) and Aglaia Szyszkowitz (as Taschenbier&apos;s object of desire, &quot;Frau März&quot;), on the other hand, are somewhat less stellar.  And I could have done without the soppy love story and the happy family ending. Oh well, as long as the kids are happy, &quot;Das Sams&quot; is well worth the price of the cinema ticket.  In any case, I can only recommend that you read the book to your children.  Before seeing the film, afterwards, or instead."

The black and white cinematography is gorgeous - it&apos;s actually rather difficult to capture sweeping landscapes on black and white, but here it looks easy, it&apos;s so well done. The story is interesting, the dialog well written, the acting is superb - the kids never get annoying and remain authentic throughout, well supported by the adults who display a remarkable naturalism. Certainly it&apos;s &quot;just for kids,&quot; that was its intent, and it succeeds admirably. If only one of the many versions of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; could have achieved such natural grace and energy! Has held up quite well after more than sixty years.",

      "reviewBody": "¨Il Coltello di Ghiaccio&quot; also titled &quot;Knife of Ice&quot; or &quot;Silent Horror¨ deals with a thirteen year old named Martha Caldwell who witnessed the death of her parents in a deadly railway crash . Barely surviving the tragedy herself, Martha was struck mute due to the shock . Now an adult, the still dumb Martha (Carrol Baker) lives with her uncle Ralph (George Rigaud) at a mansion in Spanish countryside . Later on , Martha&apos;s cousin Jenny (Evelyn Stewart or Ida Galli) , a prestigious singer , arrives to be with the family . There appears a sex maniac roaming the countryside and committing several murders . Meanwhile , Inspector Duran (Franco Fantasia) and Vice-commissioner (Lorenzo Robledo) are investigating the killings of pretty young girls but case results out to be far more difficult than it would first seem . In the little town live various usual characters : the doctor (Alan Scott) , the priest (Jose Marco) , the judge (Angel Menendez) , the pharmacist , the local junkie (Mario Pardo) and the chauffeur (Eduardo Fajardo) , all of them seem to be suspicious people . The already traumatized Martha seems likely to be the next victim when take place strange events .\n\nThis is a right Giallo where the intrigue, tension , suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room , corridors and luxurious interior and exterior . This suspenseful movie is plenty of thrills, chills , high body-count and well staged murders . This exciting film follows the American wake from classics as ¨The Caracol staircase¨ (Robert Siodmak) , ¨Wait until dark¨ (Terence Young) , ¨Blind Terror¨ (Richard Fleischer) in which a mute or blind girl is stalked or harassed by a series killer . The movie belongs to Italian Giallo genre that was invented by Mario Bava (Mask of demon ,The Evil Eye, A bay of blood) along with Riccardo Freda (Secret of Dr. Hitchcock, The ghost , I Vampiri) , they are the fundamental creators . These Giallo movies are characterized by overblown use of color with shining red blood, usual zooms, originally staged crimes , use of images-shock and a lot of plot twists . Later appears Dario Argento (Deep red, Suspira,Inferno), another essential creator of classic Latin terror films . Umberto Lenzi&apos;s so-so direction is well crafted, here he&apos;s less cynical and more inclined toward violence and lots of killings . It&apos;s a co-production Italian- Spanish for that reason appears Italian actors such as Ida Galli , Franco Fantasia , as Spanish actors such as Lorenzo Robledo , Mario Pardo , Jorge Rigaud , Angel Menendez and Eduardo Fajardo ; most of them usually played in Spaghetti/Paella sub-genre. Colorful and adequate cinematography by Jose Aguayo who photographed splendidly Spanish outdoors . Thrilling and suspenseful score by Marcello Giombini.\n\nThe picture was well directed by the prolific filmmaker Umbert Lenzi . Talented and versatile writer/director Umbert Lenzi has made a vast array of often solid and entertaining films in all kind of genres as horror, comedy, Western, and science fiction in a career that spans over 40 years .Umbert Lenzi used the pseudonym Hank Milestone and Humphrey Logan . Umberto made his directorial debut with ¨Queen of the Seas¨ (1961) . Other pirate/sword flicks followed, starting with ¨Pirates of Malaysia¨ (1964) starred by Steeve Reeves, which was part of the height of the career of fictitious tales of historic legendary characters including Robin Hood , Catherine the Great, Zorro , Sandokan and Maciste . He subsequently directed a ¨Fumetti¨ titled The mask of Kriminal (1966) . After directing a war film and two &quot;spaghetti westerns,&quot; Lenzi turned to the Giallo genre with ¨Orgasmo¨ (1969). During the 1970s, Lenz filmed a number of Giallo and thrillers , among them : ¨So Sweet, So Perverse¨, ¨Seven Blood-Stained Orchids¨ and ¨Eyeball¨ . Lenzi turned to the police thrillers called ¨Polizieschi¨, which rejuvenated his confidence and his popularity . Titles like ¨Almost Human¨ , ¨Free Hand For a Tough Cop¨ and ¨Brothers Till We Die¨ were the most popular and brutal of the thrillers . Lenzi is an expert on wartime genre such as he proved in ¨Desert commandos¨ , ¨Battle of commandos¨ , ¨From hell to victory¨ , ¨Young Lions¨ and ¨Bridge to hell¨. Prior to the Polizieschi, Lenzi directed ¨Man from Deep River¨ , which was the start of the Italian cannibal sub-genre . Later on , he directed two very gory jungle cannibal features , ¨Eaten Alive¨ and ¨Make Them Die Slowly ¨which was banned in 31 countries, made Lenzi distance himself from the cannibal genre . Then Lenzi directed ¨Nightmare City¨ (1980) , a zombie flick , and ¨Iron Master¨(1983) . In the 90s his films were extremely low-budgeted and failed at box-office .",

      "reviewBody": "While this movie is not going to be a masterpiece and held up in the future as an example of &quot;great&quot; film making, it was, in my opinion, a well made, albeit predictable, movie.\n\nI did appreciate the storyline was a bit of a formula, but it had enough in the sub plots to keep me interested all the way through.\n\nI got what I expected and a little more from the lead characters, but was a little disappointed in the performance of Jack Black. I am a fan of Jack, but am seeing a lot of the same from him in his facial contortions. Even so the character was &quot;lovable&quot;! The real surprise for me was the whole &quot;Arthur Abbott&quot; (Eli Wallach) sub plot. It was delightful and saved the show from the malaise that plagues the romantic comedy, that being predictability.\n\nI am not a romantic comedy type of guy, yet I was sucked into this movie well and truly.\n\nAs I left, I felt like I had been treated as a human being. I had not been assaulted by the violence, overt sexual references, gunfire and the explosions that seem to be everywhere. (Not that I don&apos;t like a good &quot;shoot the baddies&quot; or &quot;indecent suggestive action&quot; type of movie). \n\nThis was just good clean &quot;fun&quot;! And I would see it again (next year maybe!)",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t expecting to like The Unforgiven. Don&apos;t get me wrong I don&apos;t mind westerns and I am a fan of both Audrey Hepburn and John Huston. However, prior to seeing this film I heard a lot of negativity on it. After seeing it for myself, I think it is very underrated. It is flawed, but I do admire this film.\n\nIt does begin in a lethargic manner and I personally thought the final scene could have been better thought out. Also, despite my love for her, I was not entirely convinced by Audrey Hepburn. She is graceful, charming and elegant and I applaud her for taking on a completely different role to any other she&apos;s played, but she was never quite believable in her role, to me her accent sometimes came and went and she felt somewhat out of place.\n\nHowever, it looks gorgeous with the cinematography beautiful and the scenery magnificent. The music is very rich and wonderful, the dialogue is thought-provoking and the pace in the middle I had no problem with. I was pleasantly surprised at how ambitious the story was, the subject of racism could have easily been dealt with in a heavy-handed way like in Crash, but it doesn&apos;t thanks to the construction of the story which is quite impressive and it also helps that the characters are surprisingly credible. John Huston&apos;s direction is also terrific, and the acting ensemble is very good generally. Burt Lancaster is a charismatic presence, while Audie Murphy is a sheer delight in this movie.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a good movie despite the miscast(I do say this with a heavy heart) and one or two scenes that could have been better judged. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "name": "So-so Ravioli/Chorizo Western with the great Fernando Sancho who steals the show as a boastful Mexican bandit",
      "reviewBody": "Mediocre Paella/Spaghetti/Butifarra Western co-produced by Spain/Italy , with the unforgettable Fernando Sancho as a Mexican bandit . The film packs Western action , comical elements thanks to Fernando Sancho role , thrills , shoot&apos;em up , brawls , and results to be quite entertaining . It&apos;s a middle-budget film with ordinary actors , technicians , decent production values and average results . Two prisoners called Red (Luis Davila) and Carrancho (the braggart Fernando Sancho who would played same role in ¨Five Thousand Dollars on One¨ as a secondary and this sequel as starring and acting lots of occasions in similar character) go chained , escorted troughout the sunny desert and then they getaway . After escaping from prison reach the border to Mexico . Along the way they meet several dangerous situations and confrontation . Later on , they fight against some ruthless hoodlums (Antonio Molino Rojo and Renato Baldini) who are under orders a powerful employer and rich silver mine owner named Morton (Robert Woods) . Disgusted by the latter&apos;s brutality , especially against the local peones they are hired by Morton to find out his wrongs . The two support a revolt organized with the aid of Mrs . Morton called Viviane (Loredana Nusciak of Django) , spouse of the nasty tyrant . After that , the swanky Carrancho robs a military uniform and posing as a Mexican General assaults the Morton&apos;s mine .\n\nThis moving tortilla/Ravioli Western packs thrills , shootouts , hilarious situations , riding pursuits and several other things . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . Furthermore , there are also the ordinary brawls , punches , hits , slaps and kick-asses . Italian-Spanish co-production filmed in Catalunya , full of familiar faces , action , exaggerated characters , crossfire and lots of shots and fights . Charismatic performance for the whole casting , giving special thanks to the boastful Fernando Sancho , playing an illiterate as well as humorous Mexican outlaw , whose role would play lots of times ,as he starred multitude ¨Tortilla¨ or ¨Pipperone¨ Westerns interpreting the quarrelsome , swanky Mexican outlaw , such as : ¨A pistol for Ringo¨, ¨Return of Ringo¨, &quot;Requiem for a Gringo&quot; , &quot;Four Dollars for Vengeance¨ , &quot;Dakota Joe&quot; , ¨Winchester Bill¨ , &quot;One Hundred Thousand Dollars for Ringo&quot; , &quot;The Man Who Came to Kill&quot; , ¨Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace&quot; or ¨Pistoleros De Arizona¨ and several others . Here Fernando Sancho in an unusual main role , he is pretty nice , he ravages the screen , he shoots , kills , jokes , boasts and many other things . Co-stars Luis Dávila who gives a serviceable swift-shooting hero in his role , he starred during the sixties and seventies several action films as well as Chorizo or Paella Western such as : ¨Relevo para pistolero¨, &quot;Doc, Hands of Steel&quot; , ¨Viva Carrancho¨, ¨Tumba para Forajido¨ and &quot;Pancho Villa&quot; , some of them directed by Alfonso Balcazar . While the Spaghetti ordinary protagonist , Robert Woods , here holds a secondary character : a ruthless tyrant who enslaves unfortunate Mexican people . Robert starred several Tortilla/Ravioli Western such as : &quot;Seven Guns for the MacGregors&quot; , ¨Black Jack¨, ¨El Puro¨, &quot;Gatling Gun&quot; , among others . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation between Fernando Sancho , Luis Davila and Robert Woods with some looks that say it all , including a thrilling ending shotdown at the mine and the mansión . Support cast is frankly well with the regular familiar faces from Tortilla/Ravioli Western such as : Francisco Sanz , Carlos Otero , Renato Baldini , Loredana Nusciak , Antonio Molino Rojo , Gérard Tichy , Cesar Ojinaga , Gaspar Indio Gonzalez , José Luis Martin and several others . It&apos;s a two country co-production : Spain/Italy , but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing their product , though this one has penchant for hilarious happenings and roles . If you like Chorizo , Paella , Butifarra or Spaghetti westerns , this remains lightly watchable .\n\nThis picture &quot; Viva Carrancho¨ or ¨Man from Canyon City¨ (United States) or ¨L&apos;homme qui venait de Canyon-City¨ (France) or ¨Django - Die Todesminen von Canyon City¨ (Germany) being well photographed by Alfio Contini and Scavarda in Eastmancolor , Techniscope . As well as atmospheric , climatic and evocative musical score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino . Mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga , (Huesca) , similar to Almeria , and a Western village located in ¨Splugues De Llobregat¨ built by producers/directors brothers : Alfonso Balcázar , Francisco Balcázar , Juan Jose Balcazar though this Balcazar family went to bankrupt and had to sell the terrains , including the usual General supplies , Saloon , livery stable , wall paper merchandise , dressmaker , billiard parlor , barber shop , undertaker , General store , and other shops and buildings ; it resulted to be the locations where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar , J.J. Balcazar , Jose Antonio De La Loma , Juan Bosch , Xavier Marchal , Jose Maria Zabalza , Manuel Esteba , Ignacio F. Iquino , and Julio Buchs , among others , because Almeria was too far and the Fraga landscapes bear remarkable resemblance . There are also fine technicians , and writers as filmmaker/screenwriterJosé Antonio De La Loma , Film Editing by Teresa Alcocer , nice assistant direction and adequate production design by the usual Juan Alberto Soler , the latter creates an acceptable scenario .\n\nThis motion picture was middlingly directed by Alfonso Balcazar , and with no originality ; he managed to make a fluid and filled with punches , shots as well as fighting Western , though average . This Italian &amp; Spanish co-production qualifies as a low-budget, mid-brow western, a level before the seminal Spaghetti westerns . Alfonso alongside his brothers Juan Jose Balcazar and Francisco Balcázar produced and directed a lot of Chorizo or Butifarra Western , most of them starred by Jorge Martin or George Martin , Luis Davila , Daniel Martin or Robert Woods ; such as : 1972 The return of Clint , 1972 Judas... ¡Toma Monedas! , 1968 Sartana no Perdone or Sonora , 1967 With Death on Your Back, 1966 Dinamita Jim , 1965 Doc , Manos De Plata , 1965 Viva Carrancho , 1965 Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace . Rating : 5/10 . Average , regular and ordinary Spaghetti western .",

      "reviewBody": "Looking at the cast of &quot;The Other Man&quot; you could consider in buying this film: Liam Nesson, Antonio Banderas, Laura Linney and Romola Garai. The movie delivers? Yes. All that much? No. And if you consider that this was directed by Richard Eyre who directed great ensemble casts in &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; there are things that makes of &quot;The Other Man&quot; an inferior film than this two examples.\n\nNeeson plays Peter, a man married with a beautiful wife (Linney), that discover that she hides from him a long affair with Ralph (pronunced Rafe, played by Banderas). What Peter does? Tracks down this man in Italy and tries to see who he really is and what his wife saw in that men. His first idea is to kill this guy but he&apos;s always reluctant, so he keeps on playing games with his guy who seems to love Peter&apos;s wife very much.\n\nThe whole drama pretending to be a thriller goes well, it makes the story interesting until the ending which is quite disappointing and a little bit unexpected. But if you think I can buy the idea that these two guys reveal part of their lives to each other during chess games matches, well I did not buy it. And if they were drunk maybe but that was not the case. Two unknown figures sharing their romantic passages of their lives (with the same woman) is something unbelievable (or perhaps it&apos;s just me who likes to play the mysterious guy in front of other people so it&apos;s very difficult to make me really share something of this kind of nature). This scenes were great, interesting dialog, except for some angered reaction of Neeson throwing the pieces away after losing a match.\n\nIt&apos;s a very psychological work about how one can deal with adultery, different reactions might come from the audience, it&apos;s very interesting the way Peter does that, changing his persona all the way through this chase after his wife&apos;s lover. It&apos;s a great material for passionate people who can&apos;t forget a betrayal and feel a need to do something about it. This film will make that kind of people think again just like Peter changed his mind in the course of the story. \n\nThe acting is decent, the cast is at their best considering the material they were giving. More complexity, more realism and more thrilling moments instead of some bits here and there would make this film better. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s easy to imagine the 2007 drama Lions for Lambs performed on the stage, since the story is so dialogue-driven and only three simple sets-or merely four chairs, if a modern take was adopted-would be necessary. Three stories are all related, each including a dialogue between two characters, in a time-sensitive story during the current (depending on when you rent this movie) war in the Middle East. In one, a powerful Republican senator, Tom Cruise, tries to persuade a liberal journalist, Meryl Streep, to write a favorable piece on his efforts for the war. In another, a California university professor, Robert Redford, tries to get an apathetic student, Andrew Garfield, to care about current events. In the third, two soldiers and friends, Michael Pena and Derek Luke, find themselves isolated and fighting for their lives during a mission gone wrong.\n\nIf you&apos;re hooked already, like I was, you&apos;re going to want to rent this one. Plus, it&apos;s Robert Redford&apos;s baby (meaning, he directed it) so you know it&apos;s going to be well-made and full of top-notch acting. If this ever does get turned into a stage play, I think it&apos;ll be a great success. Many theatergoers will enjoy the witty dialogue and agree with the message. A word of warning, though: if you find yourself agreeing with Tom Cruise as the movie starts, you might not enjoy the rest of it. I wouldn&apos;t exactly classify this film as a &quot;message movie,&quot; but it definitely has a theme. If you&apos;re a Republican, there&apos;s a chance you might not like it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is basically a fantasy style movie that the audience has to just go with it. There is some parts that doesn&apos;t make sense at all noticeably. The plot is about a modern time boy who goes back in time somehow to Sengoku-era japan and is in pursuit of courage while dealing with the dangers of his surrounding. In fact the movie switches from modern time to tenshou year 2 or something like that. The premise actually sort of reminded me of &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot; except way more ridiculous because despite traveling back in time the story doesn&apos;t revolve around any mystical stuff. And this movie takes place in japan instead of china. But like I said it&apos;s a movie your just going to have to just go with or else your really going to dislike it, like the character Shinichi Kawakami&apos;s mother in the movie who just automatically accepts what is going on. When the movie takes place during Sengoku-era it just didn&apos;t seem all that realistic, it felt sort of like a live action Disney movie, even the interaction between characters seemed a bit childish at times. But than again this was probably aimed to be a family movie, and let&apos;s just say the acting was pretty terrible for this type of movie and even for a family movie. The problem about this movie is that it goes in a really cliché direction from the dialogue to the directions of the characters and everything else. And the movie just seemed to really drag with the characters just constantly infatuated with different time zones which is understandable but it&apos;s just really dragged on in this with nothing much going on. Even if it&apos;s a family movie little kids will probably get bored about 30 minutes into the movie, probably even less. There really isn&apos;t any good character development and the chemistry between the little boy and his surroundings wasn&apos;t developed very well either. The build up isn&apos;t good and there is little to almost not attachment. The plot is about a modern boy going back in time and building courage, but there is hardly a moment to build his courage and it&apos;s more leaning towards stupidity instead of bravery. Although it&apos;s a bummer the blend of the characters from modern time with the Sengoku-era time isn&apos;t done really well, I sort of enjoyed the last 50 or so minutes of the movie very slightly. Probably just because of the inspirational music and emotion even if the battle scenes got worse as it progressed.\n\n4.5/10",

I couldn&apos;t help but appreciate the fact the style and many elements were a lot like &quot;Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2&quot;, but more subtle and refined. Sam obviously made the most of the camera angles, scenery and lighting for specific reasons...the general &quot;darkness&quot; of the town versus the &quot;light&quot; surrounding Cate(the only one who could see the truth).\n\nMaybe some didn&apos;t see a lot of the dark humor or appreciate the fine acting with non-stereotypical southern accents by all, especially Cate.\n\nThis is a film well worth repeated viewings."

      "reviewBody": "Correct rendition of the most famous mystery novel written by Arthur Conan Doyle with an awesome Peter Cushing as Sherlock and fairly faithful to the source material. Holmes (Peter Cushing )and Watson(Andre Morell) are contracted by Doctor Mortimer (Francis De Wolff) for the investigation of killing Sr. Baskerville who is now inherited by his niece Sir Henry . Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to help protect Sir Henry Baskerville (Christopher Lee), who has returned to England to take his place at the family seat following the death of his uncle, Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died of cardiac exhaustion and Dr. Mortimer believes he was frightened to death. There appears to be a curse on the family dating back nearly 200 years to when Sir Hugo Baskerville was supposedly killed on the moor by a huge hound. Holmes dismisses the supernatural elements of the case but there are a sufficient number of odd events to pique his interest. Holmes soon realizes that someone is making sure the legend becomes real . Watson goes to the mansion ,there are the servants(John Le Mesurier) and he meets Stapleton and his daughter (Marla Landi). Meanwhile an inmate has escaped and on the moor sound the barking of a savage beast.\n\nThis is an excellent and thrilling film with horror elements in Hammer style based on the splendid novel by Arthur Conan Doyle .It&apos;s a genuine ripping yarn with much suspense and moody intrigue . The film gets mystery, tension, thrills , detective action and packs an exciting deal of outstanding surprises with great lots of fun despite to be a known story . Magnificent Peter Cushing&apos;s interpretation although the best Sherlock is forever Basil Rathbone. Cushing plays as Holmes as an intelligent, obstinate, broody, pipesmoking sleuth , his acting is similar to Jeremy Brett for TV or Nicol Williamson(Seven-per-cent-solution) or Christopher Plummer(Murder by decree). Here Dr. Watson isn&apos;t a botcher, bungler or clumsy partner incarnated by Nigel Bruce but a cunning and astute pal well represented by Andre&apos; Morell .The movie has a creepy atmosphere specially when is developed on the moor where lives the fearful giant beast ; besides the 223 Baker Street&apos;s house is well designed. Spooky and murky cinematography by Jack Asher . Eerie and creepy musical score by James Bernard . This atmospheric motion picture is accurately directed by the ¨Hammer House of Horror¨ master , the great Terence Fisher . Other version about this story are the following : the best version that still can be called a classic filmed in 1939 by Sidney Landfield with Basil Rathbone , Nigel Bruce y Richard Greene ; English adaptation (1983) by Douglas Hickox with Ian Richardson as Holmes and Donald Churchill as Watson and TV rendition with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke . directed by Peter Hammond .",

      "reviewBody": "The first few minutes of this film hooked me and I had hopes that it would be an excellent film. After all, the idea of a film set during the War of 1812 was intriguing--this is a subject rarely talked about in movies. However, after a short time, it became obvious that the film was high on the anachronism factor--in other words, having people behaving totally uncharacteristically from that time period. The notion of a lady sea captain setting off to attack and punish the British just never would have or could have happened in 1812. While this was silly, it still didn&apos;t mean the film couldn&apos;t have been exciting. Unfortunately, even if you ignore this plot problem, about a half hour into the film it also became amazingly dull and talky. Instead of an Errol Flynn-style adventure film, it just all ground to an almost complete halt. Sure, it picked up for the rousing conclusion, but by then I had really lost interest and just wanted the whole thing to end due to poor writing. Plus, in this conclusion, it made fighting in a naval battle look FUN! This &quot;fun&quot; element is pretty stupid as well as a bit disturbing--and further evidence it is a mediocre film.",

      "reviewBody": "With the demise of box office power for the action man and a loss of interest from the public to watch the bad-ass hero, who says little but kicks a lot of butt, the kings of the genre Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sly Stallone and Willis&apos;s careers as action men seems all but over. Van Damme and Seagal were gone long ago. Should the main three want to do mainly action movies for the rest of the careers then they may need to do so in the DTV market. However, it does seem like the action movie could be getting a second wind. We have a plethora of new action heroes, none of whom will have the staying power of Schwarzenegger and also respected actors who play everyday men like Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Nic Cage and Will Smith have turned in their fair share of action movies. The Rock does seem the ideal new action man, with his only real competition from wooden pretty boy Paul Walker and the now seemingly cursed to do crap movies, Vin Diesel (who in truth would be best as a baddie, like in Pitch Black.). The Rundown, while a box office disappointment has performed well on video but more importantly audiences really enjoyed it&apos;s delightfully 80&apos;s feel. It could almost be taken from Sly or Arnolds early career. It&apos;s not loaded with a hip new soundtrack, extreme sports or slick vehicles and loads of special effects merely to lure youngsters in to see it. It&apos;s modernised and stylised version of films like Commando (albeit much better than that.). The simplistic, one-liner laden films I used to love. Throughout the mid to late 90&apos;s as audiences got tired of that, and a lot of seeming re-hashes and Sly and co doing movies very similar to ones they had done before, meant that producers tried to give characters to these guys with more depth, without getting someone to write it decently and of course in the case of Schwarzenegger, trying to give a 3 dimensional person to someone who can&apos;t act. \n\nNow as for Sly and Willis they have wasted a lot of their career doing action movies because it doesn&apos;t stretch them as actors. They are good actors given good roles, people forget Stallone got an Oscar nomination. The Rock is more like Arnold. He&apos;s limited in his acting chops but has a charm and likeability and a good presence and we can expect no more from him than simple roles, where his prerequisite is simply to cause carnage and emote on the odd occasion. I am glad we could see a reinvention of 80&apos;s action movies, Jackie Chan breathed new life ot the martial arts genre throughout the late 90&apos;s and the first years of this decade, but they seem to be wearing thin now so it seems some good old fashioned superhuman carnage could be on the cards, there&apos;s even the possibility of a new Die Hard, Rambo, True Lies and some new films like Spy Hunter. Even Van Damme and co in DTV land are going back to basics and not trying to test their acting, because truth be told for 99% percent of these action stars it&apos;s a test where failure is inevitable and it&apos;s not what their fans really want. \n\nThe Rundown is simplistic stuff. You have a simple premise and a setting that is prepped and ready to be blown up. You have a strange mix of central characters, with The Rock and Sean William Scott. Meaning there will be plenty of fast jive talking and one liners. You have your thespian in their as the bad guy. Christopher Walken in this case and your ready, you have the basis for a good fun action movie. This is great fun. Arnold and Sly would be proud to have this on their CV. In fact it is on Arnies CV because he has a cameo at the start which is effectively him passing the torch on to the Rock. There are no twists and turns of any really note but the important thing is that it is nicely paced it has a nice glossy sheen to the cinematography. There are few hints at them aiming for a particularly young and hip-hop or Nu Metal demographic like Fast And Furious or Jet Li&apos;s films have done, thankfully. It&apos;s cool without going over the top and blowing it&apos;s wad. I like the fact this isn&apos;t made for pimply teenagers first and foremost. It&apos;s made for action lovers, it&apos;s a loving and subtle gift to young adults, 20 something&apos;s who watched the action films in the 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s when they were undemanding, untainted fun and far form the marketed tripe we get now. \n\nThe Rock is good here. He has improved so much from The Scorpion King. He has charisma he&apos;s got a natural screen presence and a charm. In fact he&apos;s more natural than Arnold with his acting, he even has more of a vulnerable side (although not that much). I do think that given time the Rock will be better than his sensei. He has after all only just started. He won&apos;t however have as high a standard of movies. Let&apos;s not forget Arnold hasn&apos;t only done good action films but good films and classic movies with the first 2 Terminators. What the Rock now needs is a box office hit. He hit it big with Scorpion King but since then his movies have not been hits, Walking Tall being a flop. His next, Spy Hunter which sees him team with action maestro John Woo has got fantastic hit potential and potential to be as good as this film. Sean William Scott is also good. He does his Stifler thing again and it&apos;s good. It&apos;s almost as much to do with how the Rock plays and reacts off him that makes his role funny. Of course Christopher Walken is good and he has a trademark and hilariously intense speech about the tooth fairy that will have you in stitches. Rasario Dawson is also good.\n\nThe action is great, some of the best this year I have to say. It&apos;s old fashioned carnage, not reliant on CGI. It&apos;s imaginative stuff and well thought out as well as being well edited. The Rock is a great ass-kicker. He performs most of his own stunts and has real natural ability to put on a show with his fights, thanks largely to his WWE background. Peter Berg handles the set pieces with poise.\n\nThis is a highly entertaining flick, bringing back pleasant memories and is one of the best action films in years. ****",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler&apos;s 2001 opus, &quot;The Double-D Avenger,&quot; is that it manages to unite three of Russ Meyer&apos;s mammarian marvels--Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix--in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing...or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there&apos;s plenty of it), is that this film--if it can even be called that, having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire, a total abortion, an out-and-out atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst pictures that I have ever seen. Look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, such as it is, deals with Kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oy), and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in L.A. Too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat, that there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all (other than some old photos of Kitten in her heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), does manage to, uh, stand out nicely. So why have I given this juvenile, unfunny, failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word &quot;breast&quot; from the 1,000+ on his Web site&apos;s &quot;Canonical Hooters List.&quot; The man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status!",

If you&apos;re into The Cure even a little bit, you&apos;ve GOT TO SEE THIS!! I also agree with the other person&apos;s comment about Robert Smith&apos;s voice in concert, WOW! He&apos;s soooo good! So extremely good with that guitar also, especially on &quot;Strange Days&quot; and &quot;A Forest&quot;. I melt every time I watch this.",

      "reviewBody": "The script is what prevents Joy of Living from being the fabulous movie it could have been. Did the audience of 1938 find Fairbanks character -a stalker, controller, manipulator - appealing? Did the audience cheer when Dunne dumped her grasping family and abandoned her Broadway career for Fairbanks and an island in the South Seas? An island escape is fine for a 2-week vacation, but will forsaking all one has worked for and achieved, and abandoning stardom for fun and sublimating herself to her husband&apos;s goals of having a good time be satisfying? Also, Fairbanks is not stellar. He&apos;s an OK actor but not equivalent to Cooper, Gable, or even Scott or McCrea, not that any of these talents could have made a silk purse out of this sows ear of a character.\n\nFairbanks introduces the career-oriented Dunne to the Joy of Living, which is accessed via getting intoxicated on pitchers of beer. She cuts loose, has a barrel of fun, and in her inebriated state finds him so appealing that she marries him. And then runs away with him. He&apos;s besotted with the Great Star, but she&apos;s spent so little time with him that she doesn&apos;t know him or have any realistic idea of what life with him on his island will be like. Had the film ended 6 months after their marriage, we would have seen a very unhappy Dunne back in New York filing for divorce and returning to the Broadway stage.\n\nWhat Dunne deserved is a husband of substance and merit who would have loved her - not just her public persona - and supported her in her career while pursuing his own career goals. Instead, as there were no other suitors, she tumbled to Fairbanks, who made noises like Donald Duck to show his displeasure and demonstrated his joie de vivre by whooping it up like an Indian brave going into battle.\n\nYes, I do understand that this is screwball comedy, but it falls far short of the great classics such as My Man Godfrey and Dunne&apos;s The Awful Truth. Still, despite the poor script, Dunne&apos;s performance makes this film worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Well for what it&apos;s worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year&apos;s MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn&apos;t like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It&apos;s explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don&apos;t fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians&apos; movies, but certainly not in a bad way.\n\nWhat makes this film so good is its associates. They&apos;re not out of place and they&apos;re not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, &quot;Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite.&quot; Well, overall, I think it&apos;s a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo&apos;s Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it&apos;s either a little forced or it&apos;s just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, &quot;Ehh.. okay&quot;, but for the most part, there&apos;s some solid laughs here and there.\n\nJeff Goldblum&apos;s role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don&apos;t know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he&apos;s pretty good. He&apos;s not amazing, but he&apos;s an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.\n\nThere&apos;s also a very good &apos;cameo&apos; like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn&apos;t lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it&apos;s first and foremost a Thor film.\n\nHere&apos;s what I didn&apos;t like (or, who I didn&apos;t like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they&apos;re not invalid by any means- she&apos;s annoying. She&apos;s boring. That&apos;s really all I can say. I mean, there&apos;s a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it&apos;s spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...\n\nOverall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it&apos;s one of this year&apos;s best.\n\n8.5/10"

Brilliantly written and acted i loved the acting and all the characters.  It shows that what you are thinking is not always good to write down for fear of someone finding it. It also show&apos;s her trials and tribulations going through 6th grade wanting to be a spy and having a nanny in the mix.  I loved Rosie O&apos; Donnell in this film she is truly an awesome actor and during the movie you can&apos;t help but get a little teary eyed and crack up when your supposed to.  I recommend for anyone especially a movie night for the family and/or friends! ~!"

      "name": "The Great Pedro Infante in an Episodic Uneven Film",
      "reviewBody": "Completed only a few years before the end of his short life, &quot;La Vida No Vale Nada&quot; earned Pedro Infante a Silver Ariel for Mexico&apos;s best male performance of 1955. Infante remains the primary reason to see this episodic, somewhat disjointed film. The Mexican star plays Pablo, an illiterate, alcoholic drifter, who has bouts with the bottle and interludes with several women of varying character: a loving widow, a generous professional, his saintly mother, and his father&apos;s lusty mistress. While attractive, Infante does not have stereotypical movie-star looks and is convincing as a common man who struggles with existence. Women play a significant role in Pablo&apos;s life and offer him redemption, love, and sex, for which he seems to offer little in return. Although he reunites with his mother, he bonds most closely with his beachcomber father, whose destiny he seems fated to follow.\n\nFortunately, the movie offers opportunities for Infante to sing, and his voice, rich and velvety in tone, provides another reason to see the film. In two scenes, however, the actor sings while he is supposedly intoxicated. Although enjoyable, these sequences are somewhat incredible because his enunciation and notes are perfect despite his inebriation. That a good-looking man with such a rich voice would have to scratch out a living with odd jobs also stretches the plot&apos;s believability.\n\nAlthough others in the cast perform well, the film is Infante&apos;s show, and his charm supports its weaker sections. Rogelio Gonzalez&apos;s direction is competent, although the transitions from episode to episode at times leave the viewer wondering if scenes were edited out. The IMDb plot outline for this film bears no relation to &quot;La Vida No Vale Nada&quot; and must refer to another film with the same title. Despite its flaws, this often-entertaining film is a showcase for the talents of one of Mexico&apos;s greatest stars. Although the movie is not worthy of his talents, &quot;La Vida No Vale Nada&quot; provides a showcase for the dramatic and vocal skills of the great Pedro Infante.",

      "reviewBody": "As part of a birthday celebration of the late Sir Alec, TCM placed this seldom shown character study in between two hilarious Guinness farces, &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; and &quot;All at Sea.&quot; In combination with &quot;The Malta Story,&quot; &quot;Scapegoat&quot; allowed Guiness to indulge both his more serious dramatic inclinations as well as play another double role, something for which he was a master. His &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; is the tour de force of this genre of multiple identities.\n\nThis adaptation of Du Maurier&apos;s novel has also the advantage of five strong female leads, three of them, Bette Davis, Irene Worth and Pamela Brown, known in their own right for their dramatic achievement. Actually, all of the supporting roles are excellently cast, even to the faithful manservant, Gaston, and especially the count&apos;s precocious and very articulate daughter.\n\n Bette Davis, as the matriarch, sets the tone for neurotic tyranny in this family; but it is a role that could have been less of a caricature if Dame Wendy Hiller had played it instead (See Dame Wendy in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; for the epitome of &quot;noblesse oblige.&quot;) In the role of the wife, Irene Worth gains some of our sympathy as the high-strung and beautiful, sensitive but persecuted spouse unable to give the count a male heir. Her mobile and expressive face is a perfect foil to Guiness&apos;s stoic reserve.\n\n As the count&apos;s sister, Pamela Brown&apos;s natural reticence and grave air, her huge luminous eyes and rich voice (which can be savored in an earlier role in &quot;I Know Where I&apos;m going&quot;) made her a likely choice in the role of a sibling, however, the differences she shares with her brother are not resolved nor explained, neither is her motivation for being so antagonistic toward him. In other words, through the eliptical, somewhat ambiguous dialogue, there is a history or subtext of sibling rivalry of which we must remain ignorant. (Perhaps the novel delineated this more clearly.)\n\nDespite the strong and balanced cast, I found the ending a surprise and a slight disappointment. For me it failed to resolve Guiness&apos;s relationship with the other females save one, his lover. Therefore, despite the putative attempt to plumb his character, it remained an identity problem hardly more than skin deep. Still, all in all, it is a fascinating attempt and a rare chance to see Guinness in a noncombative drama with strong females, somewhat like a diamond set among a ruby, emerald and pearl.\n\nOf four stars, definitely a strong three*** for the excellent cast."

This will amaze people who compare films of the twentieth century one hundred years from now.&quot;The Blue Max&quot; has better cinematography, special effects, acting, storyline, etc. In the end its a disappointing fact that today&apos;s films have taken giant steps backwards compared to those of the &apos;60s.\n\nThe flying sequences and scenes of aerial combat in &quot;The Blue Max&quot; have never been surpassed or equaled. Even in &quot;Flyboys&quot; with millions of dollars of CGI effects no movie has ever captured the feel of flying and aerial fighting like this one. The planes all look authentic, too.\n\nThe big scope of World War One does not swallow up the intense personal stories here either. This is one of the only films that explores the psyche of successful fighting men. The arrogance they need to maintain their bravery and aggression can also be their downfall. Here we also can see the politics behind the combat, both on a personal and national level. This is a very thrilling history lesson.\n\nThe actors are so good, and the characters so complex I forgot they were supposed to be my (supposed) enemy. Peppard does a good job of acting, playing a guy who is meant to be both likable, admirable, irritating and repulsive at the same time. The only problem is he looks too American for the role. Imagine if Brando had done it, but he had a hard time choosing really good parts. My favorite is James Mason, who played German generals better than they could play themselves off-screen. If you like flying, history, or personal drama you can&apos;t miss this one.",

      "reviewBody": "My wife&apos;s choice of film made me miss &quot;The Town&quot; and &quot;The Social Network&quot; which I preferred, but I&apos;m not regretting this night. As a mere film lover, I have no idea how the two leads managed to make this script believable, but they did. Katherine Heigl is a known, reliable entity who&apos;s graced many a movie, but the real discovery for me was Josh Duhamel who conveyed all of his feelings to me, another guy, extremely well in situations I&apos;ve never really encountered, perhaps better and more agreeably than any other male lead I can think of. Now I&apos;m not sure why. The guy&apos;s quite a bit more handsome than me and everything&apos;s done with a light touch, but somehow, he&apos;s effective and simultaneously non- threatening, if that&apos;s the word.\n\nAnyway, this film is far from perfect, but what it&apos;s attempting to explore is a bit mind boggling. How would two people who initially dislike each other find enough common ground to come together in the best interests of a child? You won&apos;t find a &apos;how to&apos; here, but all the small moves and incidents rang true to me, and the result in the end, seems quite plausible to me, at least. Things happen when two people get thrown together like this and I doubt you&apos;ll have it illustrated more enjoyably than this any time soon.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a huge fan of Burt Reynolds.  The man just won&apos;t go down, no matter what odds are stacked against him.  People can say what they want about him, he&apos;s certainly no quitter and he usually comes out on top.  He&apos;s been a hero of mine for most of my life and I&apos;ve grown up loving his movies.  Did anyone ever see the good ole boy flick &quot;White Lightning&quot;? Well this is the sequel. \n\n While this might be a strange sequel, I can understand why it is so different from the first.  First off, this was made mostly for the drive-in crowd who may not have caught &quot;White Lightning&quot;.  This allowed the sequel to be a bit looser, where it didn&apos;t have to deal too much with what happened in &quot;Lightning&quot;.  Basically, what you&apos;re getting is a a continuation of the Gator McClusky character.\n\nHere&apos;s a quickie on the plot:  Swamp rat, Gator McClusky is living the life after just being released from the State Penn.  He&apos;s currently spending his days moonshining with the old man, when the feds come to him with a proposition.  Infiltrate a group led by childhood friend, Bama McCall (Jerry Reed), get enough evidence to bust him, or go back to prison for making moonshine.  It&apos;s a hard choice.  Double cross a lifelong friend or go back to prison and lose custody of your daughter.  Needless to say, Gator goes with option A and eventually, all hell will break loose.\n\nThis was Burt&apos;s first shot at directing and, for the most part, he does okay.  I have a few quibbles though.  This is a PG-rated flick that was most-likely marketed as a comedy. There is plenty of comedy, in fact, from watching the first ten-minutes, you&apos;re going to think this is &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; done in the swamps with Jack Weston playing a New York Smokey. There are a lot of laughs in this film and almost all of the characters are likeable.  So this leads to my big bitch:  Why in the HELL did everything go from lighthearted to cold and violent in the last act?  Why did everything have to go down-hill in such a hurry?  Maybe it&apos;s because the film spends too long meandering in pointless situations and then, when time comes for something significant, it happens lightning-quick.  That is why I had such a hard time believing Jerry Reed as the bad guy.  His performance was top notch but the film&apos;s pacing makes him go from good buddy, to mean, crooked, bad ass way too quickly.  \n\nMaybe I&apos;m being a bit harsh, but it&apos;s all very cofusing. Maybe, had the film been edited and trimmed a bit better, all of this would have been a bit more believable and things would have ran more smoothly.  But being as it is, the whole thing has a very truncated feel.  Watch it and you&apos;ll see what I mean. \n\nI&apos;m giving this film a 7/10 because, despite it&apos;s flaws, it&apos;s a hell of a lot of fun and Burt gives the kind of performance that you&apos;ve come to know and love.  &quot;Gator&quot; is definitely a good movie, once you get past it&apos;s faults.  It&apos;s a real shame that movies with this kind of theme aren&apos;t made anymore."

If you&apos;ve seen My Name is Nobody, this might be a little similar. But that film was more of a family movie, and it had Henry Fonda in it. This one was like a Mel Brooks of westerns. At first, I thought it was just a silly movie, but the adult humor became evident, and I stopped watching after an hour. I don&apos;t have anything against goofy westerns, and some of the slapstick made me laugh a few times, but if you love westerns and want to share them with kids (I&apos;m 18 but I wasn&apos;t the youngest one watching so I had to turn), I recommend My Name is Nobody. Just as goofy and It has Fonda.",

Just a night of booze, babes, boom box, and, of course, black magic. They, naturally, end up waking a dormant evil force which proceeds to terrorize and kill anyone drinking, fornicating, or trespassing in its lair.\n\nSound familiar yet? It should. It&apos;s been the plot to countless other horror films including Night of the Demons, The Evil Dead, and Hell Night. Now add Cemetery of Terror to the list.\n\nI think this movie ranks up their with its contemporaries, though. It utilizes all the best techniques of a certified 80s horror gem. It&apos;s got plenty of blood and carnage, good plot, great atmosphere, and takes place on that wonderful horror movie time of the year: Halloween. The evil antagonist in this film is a superbly terrifying super-human Satanic slasher named Devlon who could easily give Michael Myers a run for his money. I don&apos;t recall Mikey selling his should to Satan, after all. And, as if Devlon wasn&apos;t enough for you, throw in a Necronomicon-type book which summons an army of zombies into the mix. Because what good is a spooky old cemetery in a horror film if you&apos;re not going to use it? \n\nMade for Mexican audiences and filmed in Texas,this movie is definitely worth looking into if you are a fan of all-out 80s slasher gore fun. It effortlessly compares with a lot of great American horror trash cinema classics. So bring on the booze, babes, boom box, and black magic and let&apos;s party!",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw The Boys in Blue at the cinema when I was a youngster. Even at that age I wasn&apos;t a fan of the comedy duo Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball, who I found quite clearly unfunny. But my friend was a big fan so I went along to the cinema with him and his granny, with little enthusiasm. But lo and behold, I remember finding it absolutely hilarious, my friend&apos;s granny declaring that she was also surprised and that this was definitely the best thing Cannon and Ball had ever did. So I always had a bit of fondness for this film and eventually saw it for the second time a few years ago, unfortunately that time finding it to be one of the worst films I had ever seen; I was staggered and disappointed in my ten year old self for having ever found it such a chuckle-fest. Anyway, recently I saw it once more and feel I can be a little more measured and say that the truth lies somewhere in between. It&apos;s a lightly amusing bit of nonsense that really isn&apos;t all that bad at all.\n\nIn it Cannon and Ball star as two policemen from a small crime-free town. They fabricate a crime in order to safe-guard their jobs but immediately find themselves in the midst of a scheme involving real thieves. The whole point of the film is to give the duo free reign to display their usual comedy thing. In the early 80&apos;s these guys were big TV stars you have to remember but the transition to the big screen never really happened for them and I don&apos;t think this film did particularly well. It&apos;s pretty broad humour to say the least so don&apos;t look for subtlety here. But really it&apos;s okay in a Tuesday afternoon kind of way. My friend&apos;s granny was right; this is the best thing Cannon and Ball ever did.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;ORBITER 9&apos;: Four Stars (Out of Five)\n\nA Spanish science fiction romance about a young woman who&apos;s spent her whole life in a space pod, and learns that the reality she&apos;s always known is a lie. The film was directed and written by Hatem Khraiche (in his feature film directorial debut). It stars Clara Lago, Álex González, Andrés Parra and Belén Rueda. I found it to be interesting and effectively involving as well.\n\nHelena (Lago) is a young woman who&apos;s spent her entire life (since birth) on a space pod sent from Earth to a distant planet. Once there she&apos;s told she&apos;ll meet other people and have a normal life. Her only communication has been with the ship&apos;s onboard computer. That is until a repairman, named Alex (González), arrives on the pod to make needed repairs to it. Helena immediately falls in love with him, having been the only person she&apos;s ever met, and Alex feels strong emotions for her as well. That&apos;s why he&apos;s compelled to tell her the truth, which will expose to Helena that nothing she&apos;s believed about her entire reality is true. \n\nThe movie proposes great questions about what the greater good is, morally, and how much is an acceptable cost to achieve it. Although the story feels a little reminiscent of other classic sci-fi tales, it still seems mostly fresh and original. The actors all give decent performances in it, and the visuals are beautifully shot as well. The film succeeds at pretty much everything it sets out to do. Still I didn&apos;t love it, but I have no real complaints about it either."

There is some blurring which I hope is the result of converting between 3D and 2D. The story is the only functional aspect. It&apos;s about being yourself and that&apos;s always good family fare. This is really old school and not in a good way.",

Next time I looked at the clock it was almost an hour and a half later. So lets just say some low budgets are better then big budget films. Haha, I&apos;m going to order this movie on ebay now! =) P.S. And it was pretty cool this was filmed right here where I live, according to the credits! This movie will next appear this Tuesday at 6 am on HBO, I suggest everyone check it out, even though it&apos;s a lot earlier then I like to get up!",

      "reviewBody": "INSIDIOUS is yet another one of those Hollywood ghost stories involving a possessed child. It follows a predictable format, with minor, isolated incidents gradually giving way to larger-scale, more pronounced apparitions and events before culminating in a full-scale onslaught of evil. And it&apos;s all rather silly.\n\nI enjoyed the first half of the movie. It&apos;s here where things are kept subtle and straightforward, with effectively creepy scare scenes and half-glimpsed figures spotted lurking in darkened rooms. So far, so good. But around the halfway mark, the film introduces a trio of paranormal investigators and things quickly descent into POLTERGEIST-style farce.\n\nThe problem with depictions of a hellish limbo or netherworld is that, in order to make something scary, you have to pretty much identify with the different fears of each viewer. Sorry, but I don&apos;t find tussles with greasy-looking hobos and Darth Maul from THE PHANTOM MENACE to be particularly frightening; in fact, there&apos;s something pantomime about the whole thing.\n\nThe actors, including the dependable Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson, do their best but at times in the latter stages they seem to struggle to keep a straight face while the ludicrous events increase in scale and speed. It&apos;s a shame that the whole thing goes to pot, because if it had been handled more sensitively (and with less sensationalism) by the team behind the SAW franchise then it could well have worked much better.",

      "reviewBody": "1951&apos;s &quot;The Strange Door&quot; is something of a throwback to the Gothic horrors of previous decades, except that it comes from Universal, which rarely did such pictures (1939&apos;s &quot;Tower of London&quot; and 1940&apos;s &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; instantly come to mind). Reuniting Charles Laughton and Boris Karloff 19 years after 1932&apos;s &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (James Whale English Gothic), Laughton especially has a field day, alternately menacing and comical, and always fun to watch. Karloff is sadly reduced to a tongue-in-cheek servant role, quietly speaking his lines while rolling his eyes with great frequency. The château was used as a torture chamber during the Middle Ages, featuring a dungeon full of armor and weapons, plus a cell where the walls come together (Lugosi made use of one in 1935&apos;s &quot;The Raven&quot;). Richard Stapley (later Wyler) makes little impression as the hero, but Sally Forrest captures the eye as the endangered beauty (even lovelier in &quot;Son of Sinbad&quot; with Vincent Price, where she dances in a skimpy harem outfit). Laughton&apos;s sadistic nobleman is ably supported by a terrific supporting cast of rogues (&quot;villainy binds men together!&quot;), with William Cottrell, whom I&apos;ve never seen in anything else, Morgan Farley, and Hollywood newcomer Michael Pate, who earns a piece of mutton for his handling of a bribe (he later starred as the vampire gunslinger in Universal&apos;s 1959 &quot;Curse of the Undead&quot;). Paul Cavanagh and Alan Napier have smaller roles, but are welcome faces nonetheless. This eternally underrated little &apos;B&apos; features music cues from &quot;The Wolf Man,&quot; &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,&quot; and &quot;House of Frankenstein,&quot; and was followed a year later by a similar Gothic, &quot;The Black Castle,&quot; also featuring Karloff and Pate.",

But where other films in the genre have used such tools as wit and plot to keep the more intelligent of the viewers amused, this film, um, hasn&apos;t.\n\nThe script is terrible. The acting (excluding Crowe, who only gets away with it thanks to a camp smile and some fortunate direction) is wooden. And the plot is illogical and frustrating."

      "reviewBody": "After 3 successful collaborations together, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor came together for the final time in Maurice Phillips&apos;s 1991 film Another You. The two definitely did not save the best for last in this story of mistaken identity. Maybe it was a case of wearing out a good thing, or poor directing, or something else entirely; whatever it was, Another You didn&apos;t work. \n\nAfter being in a mental hospital for 3 years, for his pathological lying, it is believed that George (Gene Wilder) is ready to be re- introduced to the world again. Eddie Dash (Richard Pryor) is a con- man trying to stay on the rehabilitated side of life when he is assigned to community service for the remainder of his probation. He is assigned to spend time with George, helping him find an apartment and aid him on his re-introduction to life outside of the mental hospital. On the way to the museum, George bumps into a man who mistakenly believes he is a millionaire to whom he owes a lot of money. George is wholeheartedly against going on with this lie as he is trying to rehabilitate himself from lying. Eddie, however, has no interest in becoming a better person and leaving the con game behind. Seeing this as a great opportunity for getting a lot of money, Eddie urges George to go along with the charade. George then meets the real Abe Fielding&apos;s wife and sees the beautiful mansion that he is supposed to live in. Going along with the charade proves difficult when it is revealed that the real Abe Fielding is missing and believed to be murdered. \n\nEverything about this film was disjointed. It&apos;s hard to believe, by watching this film alone, that there were 3 other film collaborations of the two principles. Another You is completely missable, likewise, miserable. A flat storyline that never fully develops or works enough to engage the audience, even my intense love of Gene Wilder&apos;s work wasn&apos;t enough to save this picture for me.",

And I rarely laugh out loud in the cinema.\n\nI think the reason people have been disappointed is that the advertising has been misleading - pictures of a half-naked Carmen Electra - when there isn&apos;t much of this in the movie itself. So if you want a soft porn movie with scantily clad women this isn&apos;t for you. But if you want great light hearted entertainment it is.\n\nAdmittedly the storyline is not a complex one, but after a long week that&apos;s exactly what one needs on a Friday night. I was thankful for being entertained without having to try.\n\nThe mixed cast works well. Great performances from two unknown leads supported by established actors such as Eddie Marsan and Mackenzie Crook carry this movie through. Overall, a great British feel-good movie which doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously.\n\nLook out for the bathroom scene!",

      "reviewBody": "Though the trailers and commercials made it appear to be a hard-core action movie, the end result is anything but. Aside from the (expected) opening action sequence, the first half of the movie is pretty devoid of anything resembling action! It mainly consists of introducing the characters, bringing them together, getting them to work together blah blah blah. Now, that in itself isn&apos;t bad, but what makes it bad here is that EVERYTHING about this has a ring of &quot;I&apos;ve seen this many times before!&quot; There&apos;s NOTHING about these characters or this material that seems fresh or even delivered with some liveliness. While it really can&apos;t be called downright terrible, it still has you muttering &quot;Yeah yeah, cut to the chase already.&quot;\n\nThough the &quot;chase&quot; isn&apos;t any better - in fact, I would say it&apos;s more badly done than the bland character development that unfolded for the first hour. For one thing we have a really boring bad guy being dealt with - sure, his &quot;100 me-llion dollars&quot; cry is a promising start, but other than that he is developed just as much as a generic thug. And the action sequences suffer from what hurts many Hollywood action movies these days - jerky camera movement, close-up shots, and quick cutting that makes it hard to get a sense of just what&apos;s going on. Even when it&apos;s something as simple as two men beating each other up, you can&apos;t tell who is who! Instead of watching this, track down the Hong Kong action movie EU STRIKE FORCE (a.k.a. THE BIG BULLET), a sometimes silly but energetic and *fun* movie about a S.W.A.T. team, with much more lively characters."

Alone and lost in the forest, they meet an old clairvoyant Indian that foresees their fate. Later, they are guided by the Indian The Hunter (Nathaniel Arcand) to a fort, and they seek for shelter with the men of the Northern Legion Trading Company. They note that the place is under siege of &quot;Wendigos&quot;, a sort of werewolf that has killed most of the dwellers of the place, and the survivals are very afraid. Their lives are put in danger by the deranged locals and by the surrounding beasts.\n\nI usually hate sequels and remakes, but &quot;Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning&quot; is a great movie and I liked it more than the cult &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot;. The cold cinematography is very sad and beautiful. The good story try to explain the curse of the two sisters, but is completely different from &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; and &quot;Ginger Snaps: Unleashed&quot;. It uses only the characters of Ginger and Brigitte, and werewolves of course, taking place in different time and situations. The costumes of the sisters, specially the dark &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; clothes of Ginger, are scary and complete the atmosphere imposing a sort of fear. The make-up of the werewolves is excellent. The DVD is full of Extras. Therefore, I liked this film a lot and highly recommend it to the fans of these cult characters. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Possuída  O Início&quot; (&quot;Possessed  The Beginning&quot;)",

Eminently predictable, less than horrific, with a meager human story, a mechanical and rote execution, and only a token appearance by rising star Potente, &quot;Anatomie 2&quot; pales next to it&apos;s predecessor. See &quot;Anatomie&quot; first and don&apos;t expect much out of the sequel. (C+)",

All human characters, including those of the children, are performed very well - in particular that of the wife, by Jutta Wachnowiak.\n\nThis film&apos;s plot always follows a path one can relate to. Thus providing a very human picture, with a clear &amp; common next-door character.\n\nFrom a wider point of view, &apos;Glück im Hinterhaus&apos; was shot between &apos;Sieben Sommersprossen&apos; and &apos;Und nächstes Jahr am Balaton&apos;. At a time when Herrmann Zschoche was at his peak.\n\n&apos;Sieben Sommersprossen&apos; is Zschoche&apos;s best-known film, and &apos;Und nächstes Jahr am Balaton&apos; is a very nice road-movie. Both films clearly display female nudity.\n\n&apos;Glück im Hinterhaus&apos; is much more modest in this respect, and probably therefore less known. But it stands out between its neighbors for its excellently acted plot.",

      "reviewBody": "Able Edwards is a great microcinema achievement. The story is set in a 1950s-looking B&amp;W near-future where earth has become inhabitable. Space colonies float around the earth&apos;s orbit. Deceased Media Tycoon Abel Edwards (An inspired mix between Walt Disney and Charles Foster Kane) is brought to life in the form of a clone sampled from the original mogul&apos;s body as a desperate attempt from the Edwards Corporation to regain the falling empire&apos;s glory.\n\nThis is basically a 21st century rework on Citizen Kane&apos;s story line with sci-fi overtones, introducing the theme of cloning, shot entirely against a green screen against still photography backgrounds (many scanned from a public library) and some occasional 3-D CGI. Sin City&apos;s fans will be inspired by the fact that you can actually shoot a whole epic in your living room.\n\nHowever, don&apos;t expect Hollywood FX hyperrealist environments, fancy camera moves, or baroque compositions. Director Graham Roberson purposely chose to do every single shot (even those which could have easily been made on location), with a green screen channeled background (whether still photographs, live action footage or CGI). You might say that at times the movie&apos;s mise en scene feels static: Some extra layers of compositing (and extra months of work in post) could have added more depth in making some of the photo backgrounds more lively, or create the impression that the camera moves a little more.\n\nHowever this does not detract at all from the story, on the contrary, it might even help it: The result is a prosthetic, unrealistic, yet harmonious, solid and consistent atmosphere that blends very well with the charming 1950s B&amp;W look and epic feel of the piece.\n\nThe acting complements the mood with effective performances from the whole cast. Scott Kelly Galbreath (Abel Edwards) manages to transport us to another era with his square jaw and Errol Flynn-esquire mustache. Everything here is at the service of conveying an entertaining story that despite the grandeur of the sci-fi aura, deals with the human condition and the concept of individuality: Is the clone going to behave the way the company has conditioned him to be? Or will he develop his own character?\n\nThe film was executive produced by Steven Sodenbergh, who basically donated his Canon XL-1 and Mac G-4 from Full Frontal. It&apos;s easy to see why the project caught his attention. Unlike many low budget sci-fi, this is not so much about the special effects or the action, but about concentrating on telling a engrossing story. Some might say that it follows way too closely that of Citizen Kane to develop its own voice, but I find much more interesting and fresh to imitate the storyline of Kane than that of Star Wars or Halloween. Besides this has the twist cloning, which adds a whole new dimension and makes the character unique.\n\nIf you love movies you will truly enjoy Able Edwards, as it is an inspiring achievement."

      "reviewBody": "I have not read any of Jan Guillou&apos;s Hamilton novels. I have thought about it but as of yet haven&apos;t gotten round to it. But from what I&apos;ve heard about this movie it is very loosely based on the books. Most of the Hamilton books were written from the middle of the 1980s to the middle of 1990s. One could compare it to the movie Casino Royale in the way that it has been modernised to the post 9/11 world. So what I mean is this movie is completely self standing, you won&apos;t have to read the books or see any of the previous Hamilton movies.\n\nSo what did I think of this movie? The short answer: it is no more than an average action flick.\n\nThe look of the movie is outstanding for a Swedish one. I don&apos;t mean that in a bad way but it visually has taken a big step towards international standards. Sweden makes good movies but the action ones hasn&apos;t been their strongest. The technical aspects of this movie are just so impressive. Both the execution of the action scenes and the overall look of the film makes me think of the Bourne movies. And yes there is some shaky cam in the action. Still it&apos;s not a problem, it works fine most of the time helping to create this brutal feel that the movie has. And talking of brutal that is something the movie really is. A lot of graphic killing scenes and the characters take down guys with little hesitation. Is it unnecessary much? No I don&apos;t think so but don&apos;t expect the lean back action blockbuster type of film. Music fits well for the tone of the film but nothing memorable.\n\nThose were the strong parts of Hamilton - I nationens intresse. Now on to the weak ones. The by far biggest weakness in it is the complete lack of a interesting story. It is something about private military companies and false flag operations. But half ways in to it one has pretty much lost track of what is really going on but it doesn&apos;t matter because the action is the only really entertainment you will find here. When I after the movie were talking to other about what story really was one realises that it is just the usual conspiracy stuff that you neither want nor need to follow. The only part where I saw the tiny glimmer of interest was Carl Hamilton as a character, so maybe I should go and read the books. But all this falls completely on the acting, oh the acting. It&apos;s a long time since I&apos;ve seen performances as wooden as these. I mean one knows how Mikael Persbrandt acts and it is no difference here. He looks cool and has really trained his body up for the part but he shows less emotion than the Terminator. But I must partly blame the director here because it is not just him. The entire cast are more stiff than statues. And there are many actors here that I know can act, having seen them in many other movies. There is absolutely no life beneath the good looking surface. Neither in the story or the characters.\n\nTo sum up my short review of Hamilton - I nationens intresse. The production is great, looks stylish and the action is among the best I have seen in a Swedish film. But the dull plot and some of the worst acting I have seen in a long time makes this fail almost entirely as a whole.",

      "reviewBody": "A post-modern adult fairytale like this cannot shows up every year and even today, when I have already seen all of Shunji Iwai&apos;s films, I still have no clue about where did this one surface. It is fairly easier to comprehend love letter&apos; or April story&apos;, based on a single good idea, or maybe a little more hard work and careful planning with picnic&apos;, but there is no fixed procedure to follow in order to conjure up a desperate complex like this.\n\nThe hand-held camera movements and those documentary-like jumping shoots, which make some people uncomfortable in other Iwai&apos;s film, are more balanced with montage here. Nevertheless, it is the director&apos;s favorite way of seeing this world and had been intentionally deployed just as a reflection of personal disposition but not a obligation in a drama. \n\nNote that it is vital to have all those cool figures, even the cameos, which is a test of originality almost all pseudo-filmmakers would fall short and, on the other hand, the audiences never fail to appreciate. However, unlike his contemporary Kitano, Iwai seems have been running out of sarcastic wits ever since then, or maybe just he was too much occupied by subtle tragedy-romance receiving enormous popularity among teenagers.Despite this, he remains one of the few promising film makers in new millennium Japan."

Luckily he isn&apos;t afraid to find work where he can but for some reason doesn&apos;t stand up for himself when wrongly accused of a crime. \n\nBasically in my opinion it is about two people who are very lonely and find each other in a sad, cold,unfair world but you never hear them complain. The actors don&apos;t seem to be acting but are just every day folk. If you want to see something completely out of the ordinary then I highly recommend you see it. I recorded it off of TCM channel and watched it twice in the same day then I saved it.",

      "reviewBody": "This isn&apos;t a great movie. It&apos;s a passable comedy, with some clever dialogue.\n\nThe real interest is Marion Davies. She is remembered, inaccurately, as the inspiration and model for Susan Alexander in *Citizen Kane*, which was evidently not altogether the case. (Yes, Kane was certainly based on William Randolph Hurst, Davies&apos; financial backer and lover, but Susan A. was evidently based on several women in her situation in the 1930s, including at least one actual would-be opera singer.) As a result, it is assumed that she had no talent.\n\nAs this movie shows, that wasn&apos;t the case. No, she was not a Judy Garland, or a Jean Harlow, or a Ginger Rogers, or a Jeannette MacDonald. But she sang and danced quite decently, and she did a good job with light comedy. (She was evidently in over her head when Hurst put her in historical dramas.) Gable is definitely the best thing in this picture, and does a great job creating the all-man prizefighter, but Davies holds her own.\n\nAs do several of the supporting comedians, especially Walter Catlett and Roscoe Karns.\n\nAs I said, not a great movie, but a pleasant comedy, and one that makes a case for Davies.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nI watched this again tonight. One thing that struck me about it this time was that, in the very large musical number in the second half of the movie, which just goes on and on and on - it&apos;s supposed to be part of the musical Mabel O&apos;Dare is appearing in - Davies is given almost nothing to do. She just stands on top of the elaborate stage set in an elaborate costume and smiles. I kept thinking: if this were a musical with any other musical star, they would have had her doing a lot more dancing, and probably some singing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Devonsville Terror&quot; focuses on a small town in New England where three women perceived to be witches were executed in 1683. 300 years later, a mysterious woman, Jenny (Suzanna Love) arrives in town as the new school teacher. She seems to be a student of the feminist movement, which doesn&apos;t sit well in these parts. Little has changed in Devonsville— the one room schoolhouse has a class of about 20 kids and still has a fireplace, and the people still seem to have retained a colonial mindset. The arrival of two other women (a scientist and a female sex radio host) gets the townsmen riled up and curious as to whether or not the witches have returned reincarnated. Meanwhile, a doctor (Donald Pleasance) spends all of his screen time pulling worms out of his arm and studying a curse bestowed on his family linked back to the executions.\n\nI&apos;m not even going to get into Uli Lommel&apos;s filmography of the past decade because it truly is that bad, but I will stand up for him on two counts, because he did make two decent horror films in the &apos;80s: this, and &quot;The Boogeyman&quot; (1980). &quot;The Devonsville Terror&quot; plays out like a Halloween TV movie of the week and draws from historical occurrences such as the Salem witch trials. Because of this, the script is actually pretty informed and intelligent in terms of logistics. It&apos;s a Lommel film, so some coherence has either been lost in editing or was never entirely present to begin with, but overall it&apos;s a mostly cohesive picture.\n\nIt&apos;s obvious from the get-go that this film&apos;s thematics are rooted in feminism, and it acts as a reiteration of the modern issue of cultural progress vs. tradition, which, for a horror film, is a bit sophisticated. All three of the modern female characters who enter the town represent three things that much of conservative America fears: feminism, sexuality, and science. That alone sets this film apart for me and elevates it above most horror fodder. Thematically, this film is far elevated above what it need be.\n\nAs for the horror— it&apos;s not scary. There are a few spooky shots and some really cool camera-work (the kaleidoscopic flashback shots of the witch executions are the things horror classics are made of), but I&apos;d say it&apos;s more atmospheric than anything. It has the autumnal New England setting down to a tee, and is a perfect October/November watch. The opening scene in the film where the witches are executed is perhaps the best scene in the film, and really sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Not only is it well shot, but it&apos;s also well acted and actually still fairly shocking.\n\nThe acting in the film is not great, but is good. Suzanna Love plays the vulnerable, educated schoolteacher and has a gentleness that juxtaposes nicely with the harsh, judgmental nature of the townsfolk who seem to be against her. Donald Pleasance has little screen time and spends all of it in a single setting pulling worms out of his arms (which is apparently the result of a curse by the witches tracing back through his paternal lineage), but he&apos;s a pleasure to watch as always.\n\nOverall, &quot;The Devonsville Terror&quot; is a shocker for those who thought Uli Lommel never made a decent film. This is not a bad movie. It&apos;s actually on par or even above average as far as &apos;80s horror goes, and it is a thematically sophisticated genre film. Not only is it well made, but it&apos;s also plain fun to watch. Definitely not something just anyone would enjoy, but if you like your witches and ghouls served &apos;80s TV movie style, then &quot;The Devonsville Terror&quot; is prime pickings. 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "No big secret I&apos;m not a big Jesus Franco fan. On the contrary quite really, since I believe he&apos;s the worst still living movie director and writer out there. But every now and then I come across a movie by him that I at least can stand and finish watching, without getting a headache.\n\nI was actually quite surprised how much I was loving this movie at first. I liked the movie for not really having a story in it, since it made the movie all about its atmosphere and there were no distractions from any bad actors, or horribly written lines, since the movie featured hardly any dialog in it at all. The movie felt like a good old fashioned horror production, that focused more on atmosphere than anything else really. It&apos;s a real shame that toward its end the movie suddenly decides to still focus on its story, which is just not all that very well written.\n\nTo be frank, I often had absolutely no idea what was going on with its story. This is a problem I have with basically all of Jesus Franco&apos;s movies and something that rapidly gets worse and more annoying in this movie, as it headed closer toward its ending. It will make you loose interest real fast and it makes you wish for this movie to end. Unfortunately it all goes on for far too long, which makes the movie feel overlong, even while its only 88 minutes short. \n\nIt isn&apos;t an all that interesting or original monster mash-up movie. It has Dracula, the Frankenstein monster and even the wolf-man in it but really, the movie does nothing good, with any of it. I know it sounds like every classic horror fan&apos;s dream but trust me, you are better off skipping this movie.\n\nI really liked the first hour or this movie for its atmosphere and overall approach but this got mostly ruined by a weak story, which was just too prominently present in the movie its second half. I guess that the most positive thing I can say about this movie is that&apos;s truly far from the worst thing, I have seen, done by Jesus Franco.\n\n5/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The story is both contemplative and very intense, with characters who draw you in emotionally even as you become horrified by the events that are playing out. The cinematography is beautiful, and the visual effects are simple, elegantly planned out, and just executed extremely well. They alternately creep you out and give you a sense of wonder and adventure as the main character discovers he can do extraordinary things. The story moves along at a good pace - taking its time in all the right places, leaving you tense and unsettled in others. Overall, well worth taking the time to seek out and watch."

Among the most enjoyable aspects present is the deranged atmosphere that allows for the various elements to exist together rather easily. As this combines slapstick comedy, martial arts, and brutal horror film within the same space here with an island full of murderous cannibals who attack and kill without discretion but are treated with a sense of mockery at times that produces genuine laughs. The idea of this taking place within the confines of an investigation into a criminal hiding out on the island and the search to find him getting interrupted by the cannibals bringing about the threat of capture and butchery. This carries over into the finale where it constantly features him about to be killed and eaten by the villagers to prevent his escape which has a lot to like about it. Still, the main thing here is the mixing of martial arts and comedy. The overall presentation of this one is a martial arts film, with all sorts of confrontations here that are impressively choreographed and visually exciting. Focusing on crowd attacks for the most part with multiple thugs ganging up on a victim only to have to fight off the gang. There&apos;s a lot to like with the ability to incorporate hand-to-hand striking, knife-play, and other weaponry in these battles to enhance the action, and to do this in conjunction with the typical Hong Kong flair for comedy in their battles is a real treat to watch. With scenes involving inadvertent strikes on friends rather than foes, clanging into objects around them in the field of battle, or using an unexpected boost to escape a confrontation, the comedy manages to be quite hilarious while mixed together with the action. That it still remains serious enough that there&apos;s a legitimate concern for him in the fights when he&apos;s on the losing side is a real testament to the film which has a ton to enjoy. While there isn&apos;t much in the film to dislike, there are a few issues. The main problem is that there&apos;s an unnecessary and wholly unfunny bit here involving a transvestite character that interferes in the action for no reason. The whole scene is presented as a comic chase around their apartment as she tries to put amorous advances on an unconsenting male that goes on way too long as well, it presents some horribly outdated and at times outright offensive stereotypes that have no place in today&apos;s society. As a result, this sequence stops the film cold and feels highly problematic in today&apos;s society. Furthermore, the film&apos;s wildly changing tone can be an issue as it wildly switches between campy comedy, martial arts spectacular, and tense horror film, oftentimes within the same sequence and can feel highly disjointing and distracting than if it had stuck to one or two storylines instead. However, this isn&apos;t that bad and doesn&apos;t hold this one down that much.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",

Yet, ironically, this is also the movies Achilles heel. Events and procedures are so close to the inner workings of a legal system governed by technicalities that Schmid occasionally abandons entertainment for frustrating boring reality. Points against the European Union are often well made, but, at times, lack balance, and his criticism is unconstructive in nature, yet he does soften slightly as the film approaches the credits, and so, in so doing, leaves his audience with the slimmest slither of hope.\n\nStorm is a dark, thought provoking drama that, having the courage of its convictions, aims high only to fall short at the final hurdle.

I haven&apos;t read the book, so I didn&apos;t know the plot line before seeing it.\n\nThe beginning creates interest right away and after that it just rolls on. In into the story comes all the characters and the subplot (Linda&apos;s relation to her father) is quite cliché, but it becomes apparent that it is needed to help the story.\n\nThe story has a lot of loose ends, and a while in I didn&apos;t understand how some parts were connected to the others. In the end, most of these ends are tied together, but some are still strange and never gets a real explanation. Most of the parts that were meant to be scary, or at least raise the pulse of the audience wasn&apos;t that scary, as most things were quite predictable.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed this, they managed to tie most of the loose ends together, and it was a quite interesting story, but nothing I&apos;d pay to see at the cinema.\n\n5/10",

They all appear to be wise and much more mature than normal teenagers, and they all have put some thought into death and dying, even little Lenni who suffers from Down Syndrome and cannot really speak.\n\nAs this is not a feel-good Hollywood movie but a real-life story, you can be sure that not all of them will be alive and kicking at the end of the film.

I recently bought the re-release that has the extra scenes. I am a fan of the Superman series and I feel if the creators of the Superman movie ( which I feel are the same people) had given Supergirl a better release date it would of had been a box office smash. I know there are certain scenes that could of had been fine tuned, but overall it is a great movie, I know people say Faye Dunnaway was overacting(melodramatic) I still think that she did great, after all she was a witch. I was though a little stunned with the coloring of the movie, yes it was back in 1984 however you still see movies that had great clear coloring.I wish the people who edited the movie had kept all the scenes in , because I feel it would of made a huge difference!"

      "reviewBody": "This is a murder case in which the murderer constantly finds himself more inextricable from the trap of his own passion, and as such it is psychologically extremely interesting. Marcello Mastroianni is very young here, a poor teacher struggling to survive but with a great love, Lea Padovani, who also makes a great performance. It&apos;s a bleak thriller, you lack those vital corns of humor that Vittorio de Sica always gilded his films with, like also Hitchcock did with masterly strokes, but the story here with its constantly increasing tension is captivating enough. You will never forget Marcello&apos;s eyes as Lea leaves him as he thinks for the last time believing him to be guilty, and although a comedian perfectly coupled with Sophia Loren, he made quite a few films to also prove himself capable of great tragedy. The lawyer is a heavy-weight, for that part they chose a German, Karl Ludwig Diehl, and perhaps the most interesting part is his confrontation with Marcello when he has chosen him for his lawyer. This is subtle high gear psychology in the style of Dostoievsky. The music is also remarkable, the composer is the young Carlo Rustichelli, but for the main theme of the film he has chosen Sibelius&apos; &quot;Valse Triste&quot; which comes booming in from the beginning, setting the mood for the wild jealousy that is the main subject of the film.",

Well this is the real life movie industry, not Highlander...lol\n\nThis Omen/Rosemary&apos;s baby clone enters the genre (Along with movies like Bless he Child) like any other, constantly compared to those 2 movies and seemingly attacked for NOT being them. Thank goodness there is an intelligent segment of cinema buffs who can accept and enjoy the existence of more than one Shark movie besides Jaws and more than one Slasher besides Halloween, ect,ect. This devil&apos;s child movie is a fine addition to it&apos;s particular genre, with a similar story to Rosemary&apos;s Baby it manages to present it&apos;s own variation on the story well. Good cinematography, decent acting, and thankfully a child actor with acting chops to play the Little Devil with conviction and menace. It&apos;s not The Omen, nothing could be, but it is one bloody good time and fun little variation of the themes. It manages to fit well into my genre collections (Killer Kids, Supernatural and Demonic) and I&apos;m glad to have bought it. If you can handle more than 2 or 3 entries into a particular genre, you probably will too..",

      "reviewBody": "Told through a mixture of old Japanese culture and contemporary film- making, the three separate love stories overlap and interweave cleverly but subtly, too.\n\nWithout any sullying from saccharine sweetness or melancholy, all three tales strain the credibility of what we would normally think a person&apos;s love for another would go to. But, that&apos;s the beauty - this is a dream- felt movie, exaggerating hardship and our emotions to emphasise that extraordinary bond that love can be.\n\nIt&apos;s all interconnected by symbolisms and the extraordinary cinematography of Katsumi Yanagijima has us shimmering and floating in rose gardens, amongst autumnal leaves and under cherry-tree blossom. It is here that we take breath and sigh, after the often difficult human journeys we&apos;ve just seen the characters go through. We cannot help but feel that we have journeyed with them - and perhaps suffered too.\n\nTo me, it&apos;s the first story of the jilted bride who&apos;s rejection sends her insane and the subsequent redemption and dedication from her boyfriend to the extent that they become homeless that it the most moving. Their story united the other two stories and adds symbolism at the end. The tale of the ageing Yakuza who finally feels that he needs more than his violent lifestyle to exist as a human being and the fanaticism for a young pop singer also paint vivid pictures on Japan&apos;s social and cultural agenda.\n\nIt did remind me of south Korea&apos;s &apos;Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter...&apos; in that often idyllic and contemplative gestures and activities are interspersed with morally questioning random acts that leave cavities in people&apos;s lives and the atonement needed to rectify them; or at least to try to, in a soul-satisfying way.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a teleplay. Teleplays were a common thing on television up until the 1980&apos;s. Typically, these teleplays were recorded live and often they featured the cast reprising the roles they played on stage. I imagine any director would prefer those actors since the characters are down pat. I don&apos;t know if the cast of this appeared on stage together doing the Bleacher Bums and I don&apos;t know if it was recorded live but this is a teleplay.\n\nBleacher Bums is set during a typical weekend day game at Wrigley Field in 1977. A little baseball history to explain things, the Cubs started 1977 strong. They weren&apos;t as strong as they were in 1969 but they had a good winning record. This play takes place during the period where the Cubs still had a winning record (they would end up with a meager record which was about even with wins and losses (around .500)\n\nIt captures a lot of the heart in Cub fans and how it conflicts with a lot of the money making sharks who used to make their way to these games. This was a serious problem, maybe it still is but I doubt it.\n\nThere&apos;s plenty of familiar faces in this cast as well. A clean shaven Dennis Franz doing a near Ralph Kramden impersonation as the old time, hard betting Cub fan Zig. Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Zig&apos;s wife who completes the feel of the honeymooners at the ball game. It&apos;s not as pronounced as the show was but it was a nice addition to the action.Joe Mantegna plays Decker, one of the heavy betters, Richard Fine as another heavy better, Keith Szarabajka as the extreme cheerleading fan, his character is STILL a regular in the bleachers. Ian Patrick Williams as Richie, the innocent dorky kid who wants to be like the heavy betters. Roberta Custer as the pretty blond who seems to just go to the games for the sun. Michael Saad plays Greg, the blind fan who gets more into the game than most who were watching it. This is Stuart Gordon&apos;s directorial debut. I think he plays the frosty malt seller in the stands.\n\nIf you happen to be a long time Cub fan, you understand why the game goes the way it does. It&apos;s invention but games like the one they depicted in this game was only too common during the years before Wrigley had lights. If it ended any other way, the play wouldn&apos;t make any sense. The fan reactions were typical in those days as well. A genuine Cubs movies. Well worth searching out.\n\nThere&apos;s a good story here and it captures the scene well.",

Her father tries to convince her that it would be better to wear something because she is a woman now with all the attributes of a very beautiful woman. The movie very much covers the naughty attitude of young people of the late 1960s, the first generation in Germany who was born after WW2 and therefore never experienced the hardships of the war and the years that followed. This comedy is an example of German entertainment that intends just solely to entertain and not to educate people or to give them advice. It&apos;s simply fun to watch this silly little movie which can&apos;t at all be compared with contemporary erotic movies, especially not with American movies of the kind.",

I think this is the kind of movie that is sorta just sitting there, waiting for the &quot;right&quot; people to see it and nod their heads and smile and say, yes, this is how it is. It&apos;s quiet and doesn&apos;t scream for people to pay attention to it; it&apos;s just there. It doesn&apos;t make any promises and it doesn&apos;t need to.\n\nThe storyline may veer from &quot;real&quot; life, but these two characters pretty much get it--what people do when they are very much &quot;in love&quot; with someone.",

      "reviewBody": "Disney Nature&apos;s new documentary could definitely have been more imaginatively titled, but it&apos;s still an impressively mounted experience for wildlife lovers, and feline fanatics especially. The film-makers forego an information-filled Attenborough-style narrative, instead favoring the incongruous delights of Samuel L Jackson regaling us with a &apos;true life adventure&apos; like some hoary old story-teller reading from a children&apos;s tome. Some may find this non-scientific approach condescending, but there&apos;s no denying the film offers visual spectacle on an epic scale and an intimate, involving account of life for these surprisingly vulnerable killers.\n\nFang is an aging lion struggling to look after his pride while contending with the usurping efforts of some younger competition. His sheba is trying to do the best for her cub Mara, stuck between her loyalty to Fang and the security that the more virulent lions on the other side of the river might offer. As the two groups come to blows over food, territory and leadership, it becomes clear that Fang&apos;s days may be numbered. Meanwhile, Sita is a cheetah with five rambunctious cubs, who are prized as coveted meals for many of the animals sharing their domain. Her efforts to protect, feed and teach them put her in mortal danger not only from enemies from other species but also their own.\n\nAs the beautifully captured seasons come and go, drastically affecting the awesome landscape, we witness the cats face many hardships despite being so high up in their food chain. Motion capture and slo-mo are judiciously deployed to generate wonder and tension, with the film&apos;s narrowed focus really giving the audience time to appreciate the African countryside, while several sequences of our subjects in peril prove as heart-stopping as a well-orchestrated horror movie. The soundtrack also adds to the atmosphere despite being somewhat predictably crafted and employed. The stories of the lions and the cheetahs are nicely balanced and bring some dynamic variety to the footage; the bigger cats are as impressive and noble as you&apos;d expect, but the cheetahs often steal the show, thanks to the cubs&apos; undeniable cuteness and Sita&apos;s mind-boggling multi-tasking prowess and intelligence.\n\nJackson really does attack his narration with all the relish of a new father indulging his kids at bedtime, making Daniel Craig&apos;s po-faced voice-over for the recent One Life film seem joyless and disheartening in comparison. The use of character names does actually help the audience keep track of the cats, even though the attempts to characterize them are sometimes laid on a little too thick. Keith Scholey and John Truby&apos;s script invests proceedings with even more humor and pathos than they would already have, and for the most part directors Scholey and Alastair Fothergill know just when to let the action speak for itself. There&apos;s also a cringe-worthy but amusing credit roll, where the various animals are assigned appropriate film-making roles; giraffes posing as crane operators are just the tip of the iceberg. It&apos;s something of a novelty but also represents icing on the cake for a film that has been more lovingly assembled than you might expect.\n\nCynics will point to the film&apos;s release coinciding with that of The Lion King to accuse Disney of trying to fleece families, while some will find the child-friendly voice-over cloyingly sentimental, but it marks a bit of a change for cinematic nature documentaries and at least they had the good sense to stick to 2D. Cat-lovers young and old will be delighted with this release, and it truly deserves to be experienced on the big screen. By concentrating so steadfastly on such a particular topic, Disney have made a wonderfully immersive and invigorating film, even if it&apos;s not particularly enlightening. The film may gloss over its stars&apos; violent nature and assemble footage in a way that manipulates audience sympathy while slightly toning down the harsh reality, but African Cats is an unexpected pleasure to behold, coming as a breath of fresh air in an often stuffily rarefied genre."

Sure, it&apos;s not entirely realistic or in any way makes you contemplate your life on a deeper level. It&apos;s one of those movies you just accept, flaws and all, because it&apos;s catchy and fun and full of childhood nostalgia. The cheese factor is pretty low, compared to many other coming-of-age films. So yes, it may have a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I will always have a special place in my heart for this movie. And yes, because I&apos;m sure everyone wants to know, I SO wanted to be Roberta. Ps Since when have you had to have 10 lines of text to be considered a review?

At least I got some laughs. But the funniest thing is seeing 35 votes for it as a 10 star movie, that is just hilarious. I can only assume everyone who worked on this movie voted 10 though given the number of names in the credits I think the rest of them must be hiding in shame.\n\nI sincerely hope if anyone made money from this waste they gave it to charity because it certainly wasn&apos;t earned."

Filled with biting satire and brilliant performances from Michael Crawford, John Lennon, Roy Kinnear, Ronald Lacey, Michael Hordern and, well, the entire cast, HIWTW was perhaps a bit too odd for 1967 audiences who expected perhaps a more madcap adventure, but today it deserves not only a rethink - but a reissue on DVD. (Why this wonderful movie is not available on DVD (at least in the US) is yet another slap in its face.) Richard Lester and writer Charles Wood (who also wrote HELP! for the Beatles) have crafted a brilliant black comedy that easily stands with Dr Strangelove. It won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s cup of tea, granted, but if you forget your preconceptions and let it wash over you, you will be richly rewarded. RELEASE IT ON DVD!"

      "reviewBody": "As said in the other comment, it is rather difficult to rate a movie like this as a piece of art, but it has nevertheless a role as a witness of the crimes described.\n\nAs such it is extremely important, especially in a case like this, when it is about a civil war most of us don&apos;t know about and which is probably one of the most horrifying. (By a group of experts it has been named the second worst &quot;forgotten humanitarian emergency&quot; in the world, right after the conflict in Congo) The war between government troops and the &quot;Lord Resistance Army&quot; is now ongoing for more then 19 years. While the &quot;Lord Resistance Army&quot; has never stated any clear political aims, they are terrorizing the population mainly (but by far not only) of the so called &quot;Acholiland&quot; (named by the Acholi people) for two decades now. Their methods include the mutilation and slaughtering of the people but also the kidnapping of children who are then forced to kill as soldiers for them. Since the outbreak of the conflict in 1987 there have been killed more then 12,000 people directly by troops of the &quot;Lord Resistance Army&quot;, not to forget about the thousands of people mutilated, raped or just made homeless refuges. Nearly two million civilians have been forced to leave their homes.\n\nThe movie mainly concentrates on the role of children in this conflict, who get kidnapped by the &quot;Lord Resistance Army&quot;. They are made &quot;child soldiers&quot; and are forced to kill and mutilate other civilians, often children or even family members. Some of them can finally flee from the conflict and are in a lucky case then taken up in a Caritas lead home for kidnapped children. The movie follows mainly 3 of these child&apos;s, showing how they try to reintegrate in their society and forget about the war. Most of them will probably never succeed in both, not at least because the country is still dominated by the conflict. Their families are often afraid of them, telling stories about child soldiers having returned and then killed family members. They are either accepted at home, nor in the public, where they are equally feared and afraid themselves, since there is always the threat that the &quot;Lord Resistance Army&quot; could come back and kidnap them again or just kill them and their families.\n\nSince there are no interests or causalities of western countries involved in this conflict, there is little or no media coverage. If you want to get an impression about the things happening in Uganda since the outbreak of the war two decades ago, you should watch this movie.",

Yes, we got that life was grim. \n\nBut the affectation of the hand-held camera is a metaphor for the film as a whole. It wobbles about and makes you feel a bit nauseous. And then it does it over and over again and again until you want to beg for mercy."

(the 1950 movie starring Edward O&apos;Brien). Jason Statham (of the Transporter movies) is a hit-man who has a lethal Chinese poison coursing through his veins. If he slows down, if his adrenaline level drops, he drops dead. In his last moments, he rushes to find his killer and others responsible, snatching as many energy drinks and drugs as he can get his hands on along the way. This is some fun stuff, and hilarious, too. The editing is the MTV-style of many modern action movies, so avoid it if you can&apos;t stand that. I hope the directors, who also wrote the script, succeed even more so in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m always surprised about how many times you&apos;ll see something about World War 2 on the German national television. You would think they don&apos;t like to open old wounds, but there isn&apos;t a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. Perhaps it&apos;s a way of dealing with their past, I don&apos;t know, but you sure can&apos;t blame them of ignoring what happened. And it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies (think for instance about &quot;Der Untergang&quot; or &quot;The Downfall&quot; as you might now it) which are also very realistic.\n\nOne of those movies is &quot;Rosenstrasse&quot;. It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war, even though the movie starts with a family in the USA, at the present day. After Hannah&apos;s father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn&apos;t been very religious before. She doesn&apos;t know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother&apos;s troubled childhood, Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother&apos;s past.\n\nThe fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising. For as far as I know, there hasn&apos;t been another movie that deals with this subject. (For those who didn&apos;t know this yet: Being married to a so-called pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren&apos;t immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory). But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages, it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse...\n\nThe acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented in the beginning didn&apos;t really do it for me (and that&apos;s exactly the only part that you&apos;ll get to see in the trailer). Perhaps it&apos;s just me, but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. At least of the part that is situated in the USA, because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother&apos;s past, definitely works.\n\nIf you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War, and if you aren&apos;t necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, than this is definitely a movie you should see. This isn&apos;t a movie in which you&apos;ll see any battles or gunfights, but it certainly is an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. I give it an 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I got this film in a twelve pack of films that are zombie themed. This one should not have been included as there is nothing about this film that is zombie oriented. It is more mystery, but that is not very true either as it is not very difficult to see where this film is going if one has seen more than a couple of horror films during their lifetime. It was somewhat interesting at first though as I was wondering what was going to be happening as I still held out hope there would be zombies or something within the film. Not so late in the film, though, it became apparently clear how it would end so I spent a good portion of the film continually looking at the clock counter on the DVD player hoping it would hurry up and finish. Suffice to say, it was worth one look so I could properly review, but not a film I would ever care to pop in the player again during my lifetime.\n\nThe story has a plantation in Africa experiencing some problems. It is occupied by a mother and her two sons. One of the sons seems to be experimenting on animals while the other tries to keep the plantation together as a couple of people end up dead. This brother also has a fiancé coming in from London and his mother does not approve at all. More strange things happens as the film races to its somewhat bizarre, but thoroughly predictable ending.\n\nThe movie was just dull, as I said it started out interestingly enough as a man works on a monkey, but then there are just a lot of dead scenes that really add nothing to the plot. As the movie progresses it becomes less and less interesting as it is so obvious what is going on so all you are waiting for at this point is the ending to pop up. Thankfully, it did finally come on screen and I was more than happy to eject it and put it away. That being said, it is not terrible as the acting is decent, just to dull and predictable a story for my tastes.",

Knowing that there are German troops nearby, they decide to train the colonized Africans to fight. Only one person in the French contingent seems to have an iota of reason to his thinking.\n\nI think that &quot;Noirs et blancs en couleur&quot; (called &quot;Black and White in Color&quot; in English) shows imperialism in its most pathetic, depraved form. Not only do the colonizers want the colonized people to fight for the empire, but there&apos;s one scene that especially emphasizes this. When some rich people go out for a picnic, they watch the fighting as though it&apos;s a spectator sport; a form of entertainment, if you will. But they get mighty shocked when they see how violent it is. Apparently, these colonialists are so completely brainwashed by their own pro-war, nationalistic propaganda, that they fail to realize how ugly war actually is, and they&apos;re in for a rude awakening when they find the truth.\n\nAnyway, this is definitely a movie that I recommend. We could use some advice from it, what with the mess that we&apos;ve made in Iraq. Certainly a good one for Jean-Jacques Annaud, and it definitely deserved Best Foreign Language Film.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this glorious film when it first appeared.  The following week I tracked it down to a small London cinema where they screened single films continuously several times a day without supporting features.  I hadn&apos;t intended seeing it more than once on this occasion but I can recall being so mesmerised that I watched the programme through three times.  Clearly I was out of step with the climate of critical opinion.  The reviewers had slated it and the audience around me was distinctly hostile.  There was a lot of fidgeting and derisory  shouts.  Quite a few walked out.  Behaviour was often bad in British cinemas in the &apos;fifties particularly if viewers got bored.  The manager called the police in during a screening I attended a few years later of &quot;The Trouble WIth Harry&quot; and I can even remember screaming at the usherettes to stop talking when I first saw &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;.  I had to wait many years before I heard good things being said about &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;.  It was in 1988 when someone introduced a  showing of it on British television most enthusiastically.  Whatever one thinks about the relative merits of Powell and Pressburger&apos;s films  (I am clearly in a minority in thinking this their finest) there is no doubt that they are now appreciated in a way they never were when they first appeared.  But if passion for what is still considered one of their minor works may seem rather over the top, let me say but one thing;  where else in the whole of cinema is there a more haunting and magical evocation of English landscape!  Christopher Challis, a brilliant cinematographer, is  the real star of the film.  Undoubtedly (and this is perhaps at the core of its original problems) style matters more than content.  The plot is little more than Victorian melodrama - lecherous squire deflowers simple country girl who has married local vicar - and the dialogue is curiously stilted.  However this hardly matters in a work cinematically choreographed with such brilliance.  The final foxhunting sequence, where the film&apos;s many strands are brought together, is visually and aurally one of the most spellbinding in all cinema.  The huntsman&apos;s cry of &quot;Gone to earth!&quot; at the very end has haunted me for well over half a lifetime.",

The suspense is unrelenting, building to a spectacular climax. It had many of those dazzling Hitchcock sequences: the assassination in Amsterdam, the scene in the cathedral tower and, especially, the sequence in the windmill, which is pure magic!\n\nOf course, it also had that classic sense of humor and a slew of terrific character roles, including Edmund Gwenn as the most cherubic and cheerful hit man you&apos;ve ever seen! The final scene was strictly American propaganda, but that can probably be forgiven considering the subject matter of the film and the time of it&apos;s release.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful example of the master at his best, that deserves to be dusted off and enjoyed alongside some of it&apos;s more celebrated cousins!",

      "reviewBody": "Whether you like this film or not will depend heavily on how big of a Hunter S. Thompson fan you are. \n\nOn the plus side, this film is wickedly funny. Bill Murray (an actor who has been both great and terrible in his career) does a phenomenal job as the acid-drenched reporter, bringing chaos into the lives of the rigid and pretentious. The plot is peppered with &quot;respectable&quot; places being dragged into mayhem, and &quot;respectable&quot; folks trying (unsuccessfully) to cope behind plastic smiles.\n\nIt even ventures into some higher themes, such as innocent kids being jailed by a heartless criminal system, and Thompson&apos;s own struggles between being a practical reporter and a fun-loving idealist (notice how Lazlo repeatedly re-surfaces just when Thompson starts to take on &quot;real&quot; jobs).\n\nIt&apos;s biggest fault, however, was that it failed to achieve any of the higher accomplishments of HST&apos;s writings. What makes Thompson such a powerful writer (to me, anyway) is the way he&apos;ll often turn on a dime and deliver stunningly sober dialogs on the human animal and where he&apos;s gone wrong. Nestled in the midst of the wine, women, and song are soliloquies that drive home a more positive message, and none of those made it into this film (in fact, no significant chunks of actual text from HST&apos;s books appeared at all). It&apos;s like they shaved off the surface 50% of Thompson&apos;s work and discarded the rest.\n\nCompare this to Fear and Loathing, which was darker and more counter-cultural, and contained whole narrations excerpted from the novel. The latter perhaps has less appeal to the average viewer, but I&apos;d think more to a Thompson fan.\n\nAll-in-all, this film is a light-hearted romp into anarchy, and worth watching. But if you&apos;ve never actually READ Thompson, do so, as this movie doesn&apos;t accurately represent him.",

The film print was one of the last surviving print of this film, which is now worn out too much for another screening. It was about three years ago, and I frankly do not much about the plot. Two things, however, were still in my mind. First of all, it was much more a film with tranquility. Think about Edward Yang&apos;s last film &apos;Yi Yi.&apos; Do you remember the scene where there were two teenagers walking on the street and there were scarcely any sound effect but someone&apos;s monologue? The whole film was like that. The other thing is that, despite of it deals with serious subject matters such as Taiwan&apos;s cruel anti-communist regime, it still has a sense of humor: in fact, a plenty of it. For me, now this film is like a lost summer love: passionate but vague. If complicated copyright issues be solved and clean prints of this film to be found, I&apos;d really like to recommend this film; it is a long four-hour movie, but every minute is worth it.",

A tale of a movie that wants to be saw, yet fails horribly, with some intense character development such as that one guy did that one thing, and that other person died. The characters in this film are unforgettable, just thinking of the chemistry between that blond guy and that other person brings a tear to my eye right now. Also, the plot twists are unforgettable, such as that one person died, I never would have called that! All around, this a wonderful movie that deserves the academy award for the best picture ever in the history of all things. Go and watch this riveting movie, better than Citizen Kane."

This movie revels in the 60s suburban life style and the fact even the middle class was shrugging off stuffy Victorian sexuality. But within a setting of Bob Hope&apos;s dry humor, lots of hot 60s women, the BIG cars, the ranch style canyon subdivision houses - and the consumptive 60s lifestyle. Gotta love it on nostalgia value alone but as one of the better Hope 60s comedies, peppered with his slick double entendre one-liners bounced off a bevy of Hollywood hotties, it&apos;s a winner as well.",

Plot holes ok a few like if the humans have to stay in doors how do they get fed? but small gripes.\n\nLoved the scene with the Spitfire.

      "reviewBody": "Barbary Coast (1935) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nMasterful acting highlight this overlooked gem that features just about everything you&apos;d want out of a classic from the Golden Era of movies. Miriam Hopkins plays a poor girl from New York who travels to San Francisco to marry a man she&apos;s never met but once she arrives she learns that he has been murdered. Since she didn&apos;t love him, she decides to team up with the man responsible for his death, a ruthless casino owner (Edward G. Robinson) who wants to keep the town under his rule. Soon the woman begins to have second thoughts after meeting young man (Joel McCrea) from her old hometown. Hawks has a big following today and many consider him one of the greatest director&apos;s of all time but I&apos;m really not sure I&apos;d join such high praise. I did find it rather strange that when people mention his work this title is often left out, which is too bad because I found this to be one of the most entertaining of his career even though he did take the picture over from William Wyler. Some have called this LITTLE CAESAR set during the gold rush and that might be a fair saying but you could also mix in another Robinson picture, THE HATCHET MAN. This film here is pulp entertainment from start to finish as we have three legends really giving it their all in a pretty good story that contains romance, action, drama, comedy and one masterfully directed sequence. This sequence takes place as a vigilante group is holding a trial while walking through some mud. The sound effects used here and the constant editing down towards the mud is priceless and will certainly remain in the viewers mind long after the film ends. Robinson dives head first into his role and really delivers one of the finest performances of his career. His scenes where the character goes mad or better yet, love struck, are priceless and really pack a nice little punch as he goes off the deep end. The evilness Robinson brings to the role was not only creepy but it added to the entertainment value just because it will also put a smile on your face. Hopkins is also terrific and manages to deliver a full performance full of all sorts of emotions. Her character goes through various stages and the actress captures all of them perfectly. Her and Robinson have wonderful chemistry and I was shocked to learn after the movie that the two hated working with one another on this film. McCrea is also terrific and plays the naive and soft-spoken character wonderfully. The supporting cast features the wonderful Walter Brennan, Frank Craven, Brian Donlevy, Harry Carey and Donald Meek. The film&apos;s biggest problem is the ending, which really felt added on but I haven&apos;t been able to find anywhere that it was forced by the studio. Why this film isn&apos;t better known is beyond me but there&apos;s enough packed in here for two movies so hopefully more people will check it out."

So, if you have a 10 year old who isn&apos;t into slasher horror flicks, but wants something a little scary, go for it. (We also watched the 80&apos;s version of &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; and thought it was pretty cool--for what it&apos;s worth.)",

As the last person who commented on this stated it&apos;s not the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; you&apos;re thinking of. There IS sex, there IS a bit of violence, but don&apos;t watch this with the hopes of seeing your average vulgar action and sex film. The women in the film are instructed and shown how to the master the art of Kama Sutra, mind you the ART not the positions. Anyway, the film setting is gorgeous and the acting is superb. You&apos;ll recognize Sarita Choudhury as Tara if you&apos;ve already watched Mississippi Massala. Indira Varma does an excellent job in expressing her revenge, regret, and mystery in Tara&apos;s character. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE did an excellent job in this film."

After about half an hour of actually nothing happening, the boy gets his magic Christmas tree which will grant him three wishes, but the boy has NO IDEAS. He has had a magic ring for TWO MONTHS and can&apos;t think of a single thing that he wants. Just awesome.\n\nThe whole thing looks and feels like it was improvised completely on the spot. Aware of its own pointlessness, it randomly becomes a morality play for five minutes (a morality play with a random forest giant, no less!) before wrapping things up as haphazardly as they started. MAGIC CHRISTMAS TREE is as delirious and disastrous as they come and is probably at least partially responsible for the higher suicide rates during the Christmas season.\n\nBest line: &quot;I guess I&apos;ll have to find another selfish boy to be my slave!&quot;",

It ends way too early and even the characters comment on the quick solve. Then it does the second mystery and its reveal. I don&apos;t like the second one. Scooby-Doo has never been known for being realistic but the second mystery seems more unreal than usual. I don&apos;t like the reasoning or their scheme. I just don&apos;t like it.

But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, the acting of Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and I think this movie wouldn&apos;t be that nice if she was not in the leading role.",

I guess if you&apos;re looking for a summer action flick that takes itself too seriously, then you&apos;re out of luck with this one.\n\nI admit that the film runs a little to long, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Jackman leaves something to be desired, and the Frankenstein &quot;monster&quot; (though well-intentioned to give a nod to &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;) is really annoying. But the entertainment spawning from the hokey fun that &quot;Van Helsing&quot; is all about, makes these flaws so forgivable.\n\nFor me, I&apos;ll take the over-acting screaming Brides of Dracula, the silly homages to dozens of classic action and horror movies, the cheesy one-liners, and the not-so-convincing special effects. Isn&apos;t that what monster movies are all about?",

      "reviewBody": "Magic Mike is a very unusual film. Because it looks as if it should be a total romp for the ladies. Silly and comedic and fun. But actually it is done in Stephen Soderbergh&apos;s usual style - understated, and dramatic. It does feature topless men and musical numbers for the ladies. But actually it is a drama film about a young man struggling to find his place in the world and torn between what he should do with himself. On its own merit it is a good and enjoyable film with some important themes that are usually examined through female characters. Eg the female stripper who has grown tired of the comfortable and highly lucrative career and of being objectified and wants to be more wholesome. So it is interesting to see these themes explored through male characters. Very unique in this regard actually.",

As most Italian oddities, it&apos;s hard to tell were the genius starts and the hack sets in - or is it the other way round ? There IS something in those movie, that makes me - and others - watch them over and over again though I should be too old for this, though I know their defects which suddenly turns into qualities. This movie is the most Lovecraftian of all Fulci&apos;s movies, and it&apos;s true there is in Lovecraft purple prose and stuff that might be laughed at. But isn&apos;t it what grotesque is all about, this no man&apos;s land between the pits and the nirvana ?",

Strong cast, Phil Collins works well in this role, as does he and Julie Walters as the hub of the movie: honest with the right touch of romance. She is great in this, as she usually is. There&apos;s naturalistic period detail: ketchup, grubby kitchens etc. First half is well-paced with real tension to the train robbery, much like a western but with just the right touch of London humour. Second half lags a little with some silly moments (drunken antics) but it&apos;s all the so-called dream heading for the inevitable reality check. Surprised it took this long for me to see it but being 13 when it came out it wasn&apos;t cool back then especially with it&apos;s music being so overplayed. Seeing it now in 2023 it feels familiar yet innocent and stronger as a UK crime movie than I&apos;d expected. Even the music has become pleasing in a nostalgic way, &apos;Two Hearts&apos; gave me goosebumps (that key change!).",

The setting and cinematography were stunning.  The animals were profoundly beautiful and expressive.  Eight year old Eunice Baia&apos;s performance was a model of restraint, in marked contrast to nearly every other character in the film.  I think kids must naturally like `animated&apos; characters, whether in real life, live action or animated films -- certainly the kids in the audience liked these villains.  TAINA was refreshing, beautiful, and fun.  I met several of the filmmakers and Taina herself.  As you can imagine, filming for over 100 days on the Amazon where it rains every single day with a crew exceeding 100 had its share of challenges.  Eunice Baia grew up on the Amazon, and apparently until she got involved with Taina, had never been to a movie theater in her life. Highly recommended.",

How about some realism, dosed with cynicism, sarcasm, curses and other insults? Now that&apos;s what Christmas deserves and that&apos;s what we all deserve for Christmas. \n\nSome of the comments referred to the first movie as *the original*. Not quite accurate, because this is no remake. \n\nTwo reasons I liked this one too:\n\n\n* Billy Bob &amp; Tony Cox .. a dream combo .. foul mouthed and screwed up to the bone. I&apos;d watch these guys just sit opposite each other and talk trash to each other for days.\n\n\nAnd one more thing: Of course this movie can&apos;t beat the first one. Also, it doesn&apos;t need to. It&apos;s fun. That&apos;s what any holiday should be about. I had fun watching it. Merry Christmas!\n\n6.4/10",

Set in Scotland and telling the tale of a suicidal man whose life changes when he falls in love with single mother Shirley Henderson, it is both witty and sad in just the right measure. The love interest between the two leading characters is not straight forward and it is upon this dilemma that the film&apos;s plot revolves. Carefully directed, it never crosses the line into outright sentimentality although it does come dangerously close. Shirley Henderson is wonderful, as usual, but there are also strong performances from Jamie Sives and Adrian Rawlins. It is a low-key movie but a touching one that proves movies don&apos;t have to be violent, fast moving or steamy to entertain. Particularly suitable for lovers of kitchen sink romance.",

      "reviewBody": "I rate this film as about average for the genre at the time of production, although its major failures are from its adherence to the premise of the 1950 Stewart Granger version of King Solomon&apos;s Mines. King Solomon&apos;s Mines is a 20th Century modernization of the H. Rider Haggard novels set in the 19th Century. As a VERY LOW BUDGET African project, the two movies maintain the consistency of an imaginary Africa that may have seemed reasonable to a 19th Century English audience.\n\nI especially enjoyed some of the quips that reference a not so hidden casting of Hollywood camp in serious roles. Elvira is cast as Sorais, and Richard Chamberlain as Allan Quatermain declares on meeting her, &quot;I&apos;ve seen some amazing things in my life, but never anything to compare with this!&quot; The films are full of the cliché scenes that filled Tarzan and earlier jungle films, clichés that have since become attached to the Indiana Jones films by those unfamiliar with the earlier genre. Some of the earlier jungle films were produced under extraordinary duress, and attempts here to produce tongue in cheek replicas of the earlier works can certainly be missed by those whose only familiarity with film is through the post 70s media.",

Founding members Gene &quot;Demon&quot; Simmons (bassist/vocalist) and Paul &quot;Rockstar&quot; Stanley (rhythm guitarist/vocalist) give their 2 cents about the history of KISS, chronicling their early days in Wicked Lester up to their 1992 Revenge Tour. Lots of interesting inside stories are confirmed by various band members, in between music videos, along with plenty of archived interviews from over the last 20 years that provide fascinating tidbits detailing the history of the band&apos;s global success. Very entertaining to watch overall and if you are a KISS fan then its a must-have for your DVD collection. (The DVD version pairs with the &quot;KISS Konfidential&quot; concert movie as a bonus!) Overall it&apos;s well put-together compared to the earlier, immaturely made &quot;KISS-Exposed&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "If you watch &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; because you need a good laugh, perhaps you should try another film. Yes, it clearly has some funny moments but it also is filled with dark ones--and a message you wouldn&apos;t expect to find in a simple comedy. You KNOW it&apos;s going to be a dark film at the beginning, as a lady whose husband has left her takes her own life. This horrible event brings some of her old friends to the funeral--and there they compare notes and see that they, too, were used and cast aside by their husbands--husbands who have no replaced them with trophy wives. So, the three friends (Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn) concoct a plan--a plan that involves fleecing their unfaithful ex-husbands and creating a club for wives going through the same sort of situations they have.\n\nAs I said, there are some dark moments and some funny ones. But the film never falls to the level of slapstick or becomes mostly comedy--but a mix. Some may not like this and the film is a bit heavy-handed at times, but the overall film is well worth seeing and has a decent feminist message. Worth seeing.",

A wraparound story is concocted about Hercules questing for his missing son Xanthus, who is imprisoned in the supernatural domain of Gia the earth goddess. Meanwhile, Gia&apos;s evil son Antaeus — himself a demigod — impersonates Hercules and takes over the city-state of Syracuse with the help of its ambitious queen. Ruling as a mad, barbarous tyrant, Antaeus (Giovanni Cianfriglia) starts exiling and slaughtering people at whim, generally soiling the name of Hercules something fierce. Naturally, the real Herc takes umbrage at this...\n\nIf you&apos;ve already seen HAUNTED WORLD and/or CAPTIVE WOMEN then there&apos;s really no point in watching this one. All of AVENGER&apos;s monster action and FX scenes are borrowed from those films, only with different dialog dubbed in. Its main cheesy pleasure is Gianfriglia&apos;s Antaeus. A schoolyard bully in a he-man&apos;s body, he&apos;s such a cruel, arrogant jerk that you keep watching for the moment when Herc finally kicks his butt. He&apos;s at least good for a few laughs, as when barking commands such as, &quot;Drive them into the Valley of Agony... and block the way out!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in May 1991 after a Cannes Film Festival Market screening.\n\nThe Soviet withdrawal after nine years of war in Afghanistan is given a wacky pastiche treatment in &quot;Afghan Breakdown&quot;. Downbeat pic has its darkly comic moments caused by dubbing virtually the entire picture into Italian.\n\nAvailable in both tv mini-series and feature versions, pic shot in Turkistan and Leningrad, avoids the pretentiousness of such parallel world films as &quot;The Beast&quot;, in which all-American actors played Russians and Afghanis. Instead, Michele Placido is almost the only Italian in sight, but the Ruso co-stars speak and even gesture in Italian.\n\nHe stoically walks through this role as a major sent by a cruel colonel on various missions to protect the Russian flank during the pullout. An air of gloom and defeat is sustained by helmer Vladimire Bortko. The Soviet involvement (never referred to explicitly as an invasion) is criticized heavily.\n\nWar horrors are treated here as a given rather than peculiar to the Afghan conflict. The career soldier&apos;s point-of-view and the problems of a dogface are both presented.\n\nSeveral corny subplots, seemingly truncated in the feature version, fail to arouse much interest. Placido is carrying on with blonde nurse Tatiana Doghhileva, who is constantly being hit on by the sex-starved colonel. Several visually impressive battle scenes punctuate the talkfest. Glum finale is a downer, as intended."

Although Zurlini may not be an Fellini or Visconti, his films are still worth seeinig.\n\n&quot;Violent summer&quot; is situated in the summer of 1943. The war is going badly for Fascist Italy but, unlike the population in Germany in &quot;Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam&quot; (1957, Robert Siodmak), Carlo (Jean Louis Trintignant) and his friends are still living the &quot;dolce vita&quot;. They are in the Northern of Italy while the allied forces are invading the South. They are, so to speak, dancing on the edge of the volcano.\n\nThe violence in &quot;Violent summer&quot; is restricted to the last 10 minutes of the film. The rest of the time the film is rather slow, with beautiful cinematography.\n\n&quot;Violent summer&quot; has two themes. In the first place it is about a rich boy (Carlo) who is using the influence of his dad to avoid military conscription. In this way it is similar to &quot;The cranes are flying&quot; (1957, Mikhail Kalatozov). In &quot;The cranes ...&quot; the boy is presented as a disgrace and compared to the real heroes in this patriotic war. In &quot;Violent summer&quot; the behavior of Carlo is partly overshadowed by the second theme of impossible love. Carlo gets a relationship with war widow Roberta (Eleonora Rossi Drago). This relationship is condemned by friends and relatives on both sides. On the side of Carlo there is a jalous girl friend. The family of Roberta is of the opinion she should honor the memory of her deceased husband. In fact they try to make this 30 year old woman a prisoner of this memory.\n\nIn the ambiguous end it is unclear which theme is dominant.",

The film parodies the violence in hockey, and it had some potentially interesting bits in the class aspects of a blue collar town facing a plant closing, as well as a mostly faceless owner who disdains the sport and simply looks forward to a tax write-off, but unfortunately these don&apos;t come to much. Worse is the cringe-inducing homophobia. The best part of the film are the hilarious Hanson brothers, and the film could have used a lot more of them.",

But the sets, costumes and makeup don&apos;t. The cast is okay, I guess, but there aren&apos;t any stand outs. Despite a pretty high body count, the final twenty minutes are dull, almost boring.

      "reviewBody": "There is no doubt that Luxia Jiang is skilled in martial arts. If this movie intended to show us that fact than it has served it&apos;s purpose nicely. Too bad that as a viewer I demand much more. Movies like this should contain exciting fight scenes. While there were nice moments that made me admire Luxia I had real trouble in watching these fight sequences. For some reason it was very hard to keep watching. The editing was sloppy to say the least and the background music ruined almost every scene that it was used in. Now I can understand that most of this can be blamed on the director&apos;s inexperience. But wasn&apos;t there anybody involved who could have told him that he was doing a bad job. And did everything had to be so serious. This movie could have used some comic relief. I also want to add something about a comment made by one of the reviewers on this site. In which was commented that this movie delivered on what Hong Kong golden age directors failed to do with their female talent. Even the worst movies in the girls of guns genre (eighties and nineties) pulled more punches than this one. And believe me I have seen a lot. Coweb is filled with action and stunts. And I hate to say but in this case it is not a good thing. Because it gets very tiring to see Luxia doing the same kick over and over again without having it some effect on the guy/woman that gets kicked. There was this one fight where Luxia had to fight another woman which mostly consisted of these women spinning around without hitting each other once. Looked very silly to me. Talk about failing to use the female talent available!",

      "reviewBody": "Are we sleepwalker? How, being an evolved race, can we close our eyes and shut our mouth on a subject like the children abused by brainless adults. These animals that thinks only with their libido don&apos;t deserve jail, but certainly being hung.\n\nThe great idea to film a movie picture on the life of those abused children come from the production of the movie Aurore in 2005, when the producer Denise Robert gathered real stories of people in this situation. This project had to make things move, but the results were not satisfying. Since she directed this movie, she still made some money like her 2003 movie picture, The Barbarian Invasions. But she mostly understood that her movie wasn&apos;t fiction, so she decided to make her documentary. She comes back this time with Les Voleurs d&apos;enfance and she let Paul Arcand realized this movie, a serious man that goes to the end of what he explores.\n\nIn his interview on the radio or on television, Arcand use his microphone like a weapon in front of their victims. Here, he chose a camera to film himself the harsh reality of these children that lived Hell. On the hundreds of hours accumulated, only 90 minutes was kept. Of course, the DPJ, the social workers and the minister Margaret F. Delisle had to put their nose into the story... However, Arcand gives a lot of questions without answers or solutions.\n\nLike the ingenious Michael Moore with Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) and Bowling for Columbine (2002), Paul Arcand went on the field to look for the truth that was looking for an ear to be heard. Arcand would love to relive the experience behind a camera. Let&apos;s cross our fingers and hope that he make another documentary on another hot topic. His place is there. Les Voleurs d&apos;enfance is a documentary sometimes saddening, sometimes shocking, to poen our eyes on a nightmarish reality. The silence exists for too long, it is time to let them speak.",

(And the crownd starts cheering and smiling).\n\nThis movie is watchable just once because Mary Elizabeth Winstead is in it, and she is just gorgeous, and talented. However, I didn&apos;t believe her kissing and make-out scenes. There didn&apos;t seem to be any chemistry with her boyfriend. Plus you have seen this all before in movies like Coyote Ugly, or Bulesque, and they did it better.",

A teenage boy (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is initiated into manhood when his friends introduce him to the glories of Malena (Monica Belluci), the most beautiful woman in town. Sulfaro becomes obsessed, following her wherever she goes on his bike, and he even spies on her in her home. His obsession is not the only one, as much as he wishes and wants to believe it were - the whole town worships her. Every man wants to have her, and every woman is deeply jealous of that fact. And, man, does that make life hard for Malena - her husband is fighting the war in Africa, and the rumors are flying, making life nearly impossible. Sulfaro might see her as a sex object initially, but the more he observes the more he sympathizes. This film begins as an enjoyable comedy, but it grows deeply serious. The climax is one of the harshest, most potent sequences I&apos;ve seen in a long while. One will recognize the nostalgic tone of the movie if you&apos;re familiar with Cinema Paradiso, but I think this is actually a stronger film. Excellent.",

I liked the great sound effects, such as the &quot;akiiba!&quot; and &quot;jinnkadaa!&quot; yells of the villains, but come on! This movie is an embarrassment to action movies and itself.  I kept thinking to myself, &quot;so, what am I, two hours into this movie?  Oh, wait, it&apos;s more like a minute.&quot;  Chow, shame on you!  I did not like the treatment of the dwarf, it wasn&apos;t very funny, and it was uncool.  There was more action in the wallpaper in my livingroom, than in this action thriller.  It was obvious that this movie had a really low budget, so to compensate they would give ordinary guys extraordinary names; for example, Chow is the God of Killers. See, it makes it fun!  I wish that I had watched the movie in front of a moving bus, so then I&apos;d be guaranteed that something thrilling would happen. Rating: 2/10 ( When the wind comes down you will see who rules, Chow!)"

      "reviewBody": "David (Pierre-Louis Bonnetblanc) is a teenager spending the summer holiday on his uncle&apos;s farm. The film depicts a special day on the farm for David: the first time his two uncles allow him to eat and drink with the men - a group of farmers and other country dwellers. David gets drunk, throws up, lazes around in the sun, and then wanders off through the fields to meet his friend Matthieu (Laurent Simon). It&apos;s a day fraught with tension and incident.\n\nLe Souffle is the debut feature film from writer-director Damien Odoul. It is an odd, tantalizing mixture: the carefully shot (in black and white), rather straightforward storytelling is set alongside some surreal and poetic imagery, all of which hints at a bold talent preparing to flourish. So for the most part we get nicely observed, almost documentary-style shots of farm life (e.g. a farmer slits a lamb&apos;s throat in close-up) and the countryside on a swelteringly hot day. And we also see some of David&apos;s fantasies - or, perhaps more accurately, poetic extensions of his state of mind: he imagines himself covered in mud, frolicking in the woods with wolves, wrestling with his uncles and drifting on the water with a girl.\n\nAs David, the previously unknown Bonnetblanc gives a performance which is startling in the way it lacks vanity: he portrays the frustration, awkwardness and casualness of this bored adolescent&apos;s day in the sun so well, it sometimes feel as if the viewer is intruding; he&apos;s an actor to watch out for. The rest of the cast is good too, although one wonders whether the film sometimes offers a limited view of the secondary characters. Perhaps, though, it&apos;s just aiming to portray the limitations of the world in which David is being brought up: he&apos;s fatherless, and we might hope that he will have more positive influences around him than these men who seem so scornful of their own upbringings and rather dismissive towards their wives.\n\nIn general, then, Le Souffle, at 77 minutes, manages to make quite an impact, and I&apos;m looking forward to Odoul&apos;s - and Bonnetblanc&apos;s - next work.",

The atmosphere of the West-Berlin locations are captured perfectly in this raw and intelligent thriller, and the city looks different as in any other film it has been shown.  Many of the actors and crew members were at the very beginning of their careers when they starred in this picture, especially the young Jürgen Prochnow and Otto Sanders give great performances.  Too bad it&apos;s not available on DVD, it&apos;s definitely one of those films that aged very well and should get a proper anniversary release. 9/10",

Anna Cieslak gives a strong performance as the fated Mariola, a young Polish girl, who&apos;s leaves her home looking for a brighter future, but ends up being delivered into the hands of devils.\n\nCieslak&apos;s performance is the strongest part of the movie. As a film it&apos;s competently realised, but also feels a little vacuous, although that same feeling works well alongside Cieslak&apos;s character, whom understandably is losing her self to the tortures she is forced into.\n\nAs with Lilja 4-Ever, Masz Na Imie Justine is an important film, that warns us of the evil that man can inflict, and it is a horror that is sadly all too real.",

I think the character was quite good for the comedy genre, so bad the writers of the story weren&apos;t bit more creative. The core of the comedy is, that at certain situation, three different groups or individuals mastermind and want to execute the kidnapping (including Mr. King himself). This situation brings a lot of confusion and fun, but I was very disappointed at the laughable material in this comedy. It definitely isn&apos;t the type of comedy where you have problems to catch on breathing. Quite reversely, you&apos;ll hardly laugh at this flick. It&apos;s a kind of light movie you can stare at, and smile for the most part. I expected much more, but it didn&apos;t hurt.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s funny how people remember a film they are reminiscing about. An example would be &quot;Muriel&apos;s Wedding&quot; - a film that is labeled as a comedy. And yet it is one of the saddest &amp; most realistic films about family life that has been made. When you remember the film, its moments of humour are so clever, that they hide the dark undercurrents explored.\n\nThe same goes for &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (SNF), a film that showcases disco in its most perfect form. And yet the true theme of the movie is about wanting more out of your life but just existing, until something affects you so much that you decide to start living.\n\nJohn Travolta&apos;s character is so well played against his friends who are, quite simply, cruel no hopers who disrespect the opposite sex &amp; treat them as fifth best against the car they all share to have &apos;mobile&apos; sex in.\n\nThe female character that eventually shifts Travolta&apos;s character appears at a time when horrific events really force him to reassess where he is going  something that his friends will never be unable to ever do.\n\nIt is easy to label a movie a certain way. There are films with similar themes such as &apos;Good Will Hunting&apos;, which is noted for its themes &amp; dialogue rather than being a kitsch memory, and we should remember SNF for the same reasons."

It might be coming due to the fact that no director wants to work with Jack Carson any more. So Carson gets the idea he&apos;s going to direct the next film he does with Dennis Morgan. And since no leading lady wants to work with him, the team needs a fresh face.\n\nMorgan and Carson did a series of films at Warner Brothers who were trying to create a Crosby-Hope tandem of their own. They were good,but not as good. It really helped Bing and Bob to have two of the top rated radio shows in the country where every week you could guarantee that the two of them would have a jab or two at the other&apos;s expense. And they guested on each other&apos;s show innumerable times. This provided a built in publicity machine that Morgan and Carson couldn&apos;t possibly compete with.\n\nThis was the last of their films as a team and Warners did something here that Paramount couldn&apos;t do for Bing and Bob. That was have the boys play themselves and try to get a leading lady. At Paramount that job was sewed up by Dorothy Lamour.\n\nDennis Morgan had a pleasing Irish tenor voice. Unfortunately Warners also didn&apos;t do as well by him as Paramount did by Crosby in the way of songs. If you can remember any of the songs from any of the Morgan- Carson films, God Bless You. The ones that Bing sang made it to the top of the charts.\n\nThat being said, Morgan and Carson were fine performers in their own right and the film is a nice piece of nostalgia seeing all the cameo appearances by various stars working at Warner Brothers at the time. All the Crosby-Hope monkeyshines are done well by them.\n\nTry as they may, Doris Day gets fed up and just wants to go back to Gurkey&apos;s Corners, Wisconsin and marry fiancée Jeffrey Bushdinkel.\n\nBut you got to watch the movie to learn about Jeffrey Bushdinkel.",

The uses are innumerous, including being used as a weapon.\n\nTuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) was the test pilot for this new technology. He was supposed to be injected into a rabbit in a lab. What really ended up happening was that he was injected into a total stranger in a mall-- Jack Putter (Martin Short). There was one hilarious moment after the other as Jack thought he was going crazy all the while he had to elude some nefarious characters that wanted the technology that was inside of him.\n\nIt was a brilliant movie that blended sci-fi with comedy; two genres I love when done right.",

It moves oneself to see those Muslim people who chose to stay behind in India, with their plight and dilemma. It definitely plays a big role to arouse sympathy and a soft corner for Muslim brethren who chose to stay in India, despite all the odds against them. All those associated with the story like Ismat Chugtai, Kaifi Azmi &amp; Shama Zaidi have given an unbiased portrayal of that time. The story seemed to be too real. One loves to see the Muslim family in the movie sitting together and having their meals, where everybody participates in the discussion of the circumstances. Like the story, acting was natural all across the board, the only regret being, one expected some memorable songs, at least one or two, which were not there. Music is like dessert to an Asian mind, which adds to the lasting taste of the meal. With good music, this movie might have been declared a commercial hit too.",

Johnny ends up shot, dying and on the run. The movie tracks the multiple stalking of this wounded, dying creature. Everyone wants a piece of him for different reasons.\n\nWhy the IRA and Belfast aren&apos;t named I don&apos;t know - perhaps the politics of the time caused this.\n\nSome aspects of the movie have dated somewhat, but much of it remains gripping and fascinating.\n\nHarold Pinter refers to it constantly in his play Old Times and you can imagine that a young Pinter would have been influenced by this movie.\n\nCheck this one out, for sure.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is nothing to write home about, but it has a few shiny flourishes. The thing to remember is that this film was aimed at the teen age and college comic book crowd. It wasn&apos;t meant to be anything more than that. And when you look at it in that context you find those bright moments that Reitman was trying to give the audience. \n\nThis isn&apos;t adult fare gone bad as it was presented for adults. It&apos;s teenage fast-food cinema that&apos;s got more production values and gloss than the teen-sex romps I grew up with; &quot;Spring Break&quot; or &quot;One Crazy Summer&quot; as examples.\n\nYeah, Thurman&apos;s character has got issues. But she&apos;s supposed to. This is a teenage guy film about a comic book guy&apos;s perspective on women. The target audience is probably the biggest item to criticize, because if there are enough people (immature men) who fall into the category of feeling helpless and powerless against women when in a relationship, then maybe there&apos;s something wrong with society to allow such a population to explode and support this film. Yeah, that&apos;s kind of high minded and somewhat near leaving the topic of the film itself, but I think it&apos;s important to contemplate.\n\nAll in all I didn&apos;t mind the film, but did find it ridiculous and mildly amusing here and there. Yes, a better film could have been made for the adult dating scene, and we could argue about whether that should have been greenlit as opposed to what we have, and yes, it probably would have been a better film. But take this film for what it is, a time waster. A film to put on the DVD player as you hit the &quot;sleep&quot; button on your TV.\n\nWatch if only so inclined."

The British Film Institute did a restored print of the original Italian version in 2003. I saw it in a theater in London last summer and found it fabulous, not least for seeing it in the wide screen setting. It&apos;s now out on DVD on three disks: the restored print with Italian dialogue (Burt Lancaster dubbed into Italian -- it sounds wacky, but it works big time); a disk with the butchered English release version of forty years ago (valuable to see what they did, and also to hear Lancaster&apos;s own English); and a disk with supplementary materials including very interesting interviews with a wide variety of participants in the movie. Of the multi-hour blockbusters of the period, I&apos;d put it behind Lawrence of Arabia, but very close to Doctor Zhivago and well ahead of Ryan&apos;s Daughter. \n\nDvB"

      "reviewBody": "DreamWorks has always favored frivolous humor over meaningful insight. They aren&apos;t Pixar. This isn&apos;t necessarily always a bad thing as they have had some solid hits in the recent years. Kung Fu Panda remains my favorite of the series from the studio. With The Boss Baby, their signature humor remains intact. I laughed quite often in the early stages of the film. Alec Baldwin is hilarious voicing the baby at the center, however, while I admire DreamWorks for getting ambitious with the concept of the film, it is almost so high-concept, that the core audience will be completely lost and the adults will shrug at how convoluted the many twists in the plot are. Still, The Boss Baby is frequently bouncy and frenetic and will entertain the kiddies, even if they don&apos;t get all the plot points. In the end, however, the need of the directors to pile on a thickly saccharine ending that keeps rolling on, makes the film end rather disingenuously.",

It&apos;s actually quite interesting, and has some good action sequences. The plot is pretty interesting, and moves along very nicely, quickly moving on, constantly developing. The acting was convincing enough, there wasn&apos;t really any scenes that were terrible, even though a lot of the scenes and lines were very corny; it fit perfectly in with the movie, and as such wasn&apos;t out of place. It&apos;s pretty much a B-movie, but if you like(or just enjoy mildly) B-movies, you&apos;ll probably be at least reasonably entertained by it. It&apos;s reminiscent of movies like Fortress, but just a little better in that it&apos;s very unpredictable; no matter what you think is gonna happen, you&apos;ll be surprised again and again by what happens. It&apos;s pretty interesting all the way through, it has some good, 80&apos;s style action, corny B-movie lines, a B-movie feel throughout the movie... so, if you can watch it for free, either borrow it from a friend, or watch it on TV... if not, only watch it if you&apos;re into movies like Fortress. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Odd the way technology works. Less than a decade ago, there was this completely different technological world, a world of pagers, floppy disks, dial-up modems (which are as obsolete as typewriters), and gigantic brick-like cell phones. I remember being amazed at that little tiny flap at the bottom of the phone, as thin as a credit card and yet able to pick up your voice and transmit it through the air. Now it&apos;s a feature so obsolete that it may as well never have been there. Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett, a lonely computer analyst who is so connected to her computer that she sits on the beach in Mexico, on her first vacation in six years, with her laptop on her lap. It&apos;s not only like a source of nourishment but her connection to the world and the establishment and maintenance of her identity.\n\nThis is where her problems begin. Like The Manchurian Candidate back in the 1960s (and again in less than a week from this writing), The Net plays on the popular fears of the society in which it is released. The Manchurian Candidate originally played off the fears instilled in people by the recently ended Cold War, while The Net, a much less potent thriller, suggests the scary possibilities of a world in which we are so inextricably connected to computers. Probably the most interesting thing in the movie now is the computers, such as the massive laptops with the tiny screens, the indispensable floppy disks which are now almost nonexistent, the graphics, etc.\n\nAngela Bennett has had her digital identity stolen and replaced with that of Ruth Marx, who has a lengthy police record and who thus takes over Angela&apos;s identity. It&apos;s pretty clever, I suppose, the way the movie presents Angela as though she hasn&apos;t left her apartment in six years and with a mother suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s (and thus not able to help identify the real Angela later), but it&apos;s pretty hard to believe that not a single person in the office where she worked noticed that Angela started being a completely different person. She had no significant other, was not dating, and no parents who could identify her, but was she such a recluse that even the people in the office she worked in didn&apos;t even know what she looked like?\n\nAt any rate, the plot of the movie is pretty smartly created, although it is created as though it were an excuse for a lot of chase scenes, one of which takes place on a merry-go-round in a great homage to Hitchcock&apos;s Strangers On A Train, one of the many classic films to which the movie alludes, several of them other Hitchcock films. Bennett has been given a disk which contains a website, I suppose, which turns out to contain a weakness in a security system about to be set up to protect everything from banks to Wall Street to the CIA. By holding down Control and Shift and clicking on the little Pi icon in the corner of the screen, you are transported from a ludicrous page about Mozart&apos;s Ghost, apparently a god-awful metal band, and into highly classified government documents. The disk provides the bad guys with a reason to want to capture Bennett, and thus you have a movie.\n\n Angela goes from a comfortable but bored computer analyst, doing a lot of her work from home and ordering pizza on the Internet at the end of the day (presumably one of the future possibilities of the internet which never came to exist), to a wanted fugitive, ultimately caught and put into a jail cell for someone else&apos;s crimes. She has lost her home, her job, her identity, her life. Bullock actually puts in a pretty good performance in the movie. I&apos;m not a huge fan, but I appreciated the realness that her character had, since she is not an over the top actor, her characters are generally very real because she is as well. \n\nWhere the movie trips up is that it tries to suggest that such identity theft could happen to anyone in our technological age, but given the effort put into presenting Angela as someone with no personal contacts with just about anyone, really it could only happen to someone like Angela, and are there really that many people that no one can identify by looks? Even the guy at the local video store might recognize her as the lady who rents under her account. Oh well. There&apos;s also a glitch in the end of the movie that Mick LaSalle points out and that only people familiar with San Francisco, where the climax of the film takes place, will notice. As Angela rushes through a Macintosh exhibition at the real Moscone Center, she desperately tries to copy all the computer files before the bad guys get her. Pretty tense, but if she had been smart, she could have gone to The San Francisco Chronicle office, which is a block down the street from the Moscone Center.\n\nBut hey, maybe the Chronicle doesn&apos;t have high enough walkways out back.",

The old lady is actually the ruthless criminal The Man without a Face (Jacques Champreux), the master of disguise that wears a red mask. He tortures and kills Maxime without getting any answer about the location of the treasure.\n\nMaxime&apos;s nephew, the sailor Paul de Borrego (Ugo Pagliai), returns from a trip and teams up with his girlfriend, her best friend, with Inspector Sorbier (Gert Froebe) and his team trying to arrest the evil criminal. But The Man without a Face uses a sort of human zombies created his insane doctor and his gorgeous assistant (Gayle Hunnicutt) that wears a mask and outfits similar to the Catwoman to lure the police and achieve his intent. \n\n&quot;Nuits rouges&quot; is a messy, lame and crazy low-budget movie directed by Georges Franju. The Man without a Face is visibly inspired in Fantomas, but the adventure is too silly and the acting is very poor. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Noites Vermelhas&quot; (&quot;Red Nights&quot;)",

Two friends, Joe and Lucy, decide to challenge themselves to keep a promise made in their college years: to kill themselves if they are not both in successful relationships by the time Lucy turns 30. This movie takes a unlikely device and makes it seem poissible and introduces characters who are easy to care about and believe in. This film has a beautiful pop soundtrack by Marry Me Jane, and is handled admirably by Eric Schaeffer&apos;s humane hand. This film has great performances, and is a treat for Sarah Jessica Parker fans especially. The theme is a common movie theme of happiness is often right under your nose, but it is handled in a unusual way. All Around this movie is fun"

With that being said, the movie starts out pretty nicely seeming like a &quot;slice of life&quot; style. Me and my friend were sat wondering when the movie was going to transition into a horror. The story was a little difficult to follow, but we got it down to: &quot;a girl gets made fun of because of how she looks, and she doesn&apos;t take it so well.&quot;\n\nOnce the movie gets into the horror aspect, that&apos;s when it start to go down for me. Some of the decisions made by the characters just seemed ridiculous like no thought was put into it. My and my friend ended up laughing a bit at some of the more serious scenes of the movie because of that.

As a photographer I like big screen and small screen movies that are picturesque. So &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; is another favorite. I also like movies that move me, even to tears (that doesn&apos;t bother me), which this movie does, so &quot;Old Yeller&quot; is another favorite and this database hit the mark on what else I might like. I play piano and trumpet in band and have an appreciation for the instrumentation this movie soundtrack offers. I am Christian and the vocal soundtrack gets you thinking of this life and the afterlife. I enjoy Neil Diamond as a vocalist. I give the movie a rating of 9 out of 10. Nothing is perfect. In closing I was hoping to see this movie re-released soon on the big screen - or at least dvd - but with the comments in this database - I don&apos;t see an executive taking an option on that."

Ranks above many of the similar films which followed by having classic horror themes in the stories - werewolves, voodoo, severed hand, killer plant and vampires. Film also has well above average cast and a tone which remains sombre right up to the bleak ending. That said we do have the one comic relief story, which as usual is by far the weakest - here we have Roy Castle as a jazz musician getting caught up in voodoo.\n\nIt is the framing story in these horror anthologies which often make or break the entire film, and in &apos;Dr Terror&apos;s ....&apos; it is excellent with Cushing having a real tone of menace as the quietly spoken, sinister Dr Schreck, as the action switches back to the increasingly claustrophobic train carriage.\n\nAt a time when Hammer&apos;s standards were beginning to slip, Amicus provided an important rival which ensured the British horror output remained interesting and inventive for quite some time.",

      "reviewBody": "Some films are born ordinary, others base their strength in the unusual. Vilaine is of the 2nd kind as you must have guessed.\n\nMélanie Lupin is the perfect actress for this, so much she seems to be born for the role. She&apos;s not that ugly, but the way she walks, talks and acts is what makes she darn... unpleasant. And that is enough for making her evil... in a very funny way.\n\nBeautifully ugly Frédérique Bel, from &quot;Petits meutres en famille&quot;, &quot;Drôle de Noël!&quot; and others, is here again a hateful dumb leggy blonde. Blandine is even better, with her shrill voice and the most kitsch of museums as her legacy. And Jessica, my God. The dumbest being around, vulgar, and pretty nice, an explosive combination :)! If you are familiar with French TV, it&apos;s particularly funny to see her participate in the popular TV questions programs like &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot;, with the real life conductors being put off by her utter stupidity. Jonathan (the hunk), Aymeric (the coveted eligible bachelor), Martinez! as the crass stingy boss who is really just a sorry chap. Melanie&apos;s mother and grandma are also great. My favourite scene is probably Blandine&apos;s nightmare, with the pensioners as the &quot;Night of the living dead&quot;, a good metaphor of the sorry state of old people, even in advanced wealthy democracies. Same goes for ugly people.\n\nLike on most well told stories, nothing is in vain. Innocent Drogba has no legal residence and can&apos;t read? Bear that in mind. An elephant ran away on Saint Valentine? It will be important later, believe it or not :). Creativity abounds in this film, like few others. \n\nMusic is extremely well chosen, it shows subtle knowledge and a great sense of humour.\n\nThanks to an IMDb reviewer I learn that Berry is a daughter of a well known actress, and it&apos;s no wonder. Don&apos;t miss the end credits, during the credits she shows she&apos;s really capable of doing ANYTHING funny :)!\n\nNot for everybody, but don&apos;t miss this odd comedy!",

      "reviewBody": "I caught this film by accident and found it fascinating. I&apos;ve been living in the US for the last 10 years so I had never heard of Polygram and didn&apos;t know the story. I used to work in the film industry in the 1980s. The documentary seemed like a replay of what happened to Goldcrest. Goldcrest was a British company that won Oscars making films like Chariots of Fire, Gandhi and The Killing Fields. Golcrest tried making big-budget films featuring Hollywood stars and went bust. \n\nThe moral of the Goldcrest story is don&apos;t try and compete with Hollywood in the mainstream film market, but there seems to be an almost kamikaze wish amongst certain British businessmen to want to be big in America. It&apos;s like moths to a flame. They don&apos;t realize that the culture is so different. \n\nFor someone living in London it&apos;s impossible to predict what Americans will pay to see. The BBC started a TV channel, called BBC America, presumably to showcase its talent, but it now seems to just show reruns of Star Trek, Top Gear and anything featuring Gordon Ramsey. \n\nThe documentary focuses on Four Weddings and a Funeral to justify the company&apos;s strategy of U.S. Expansion, but that film only earned 21% of its gross revenues from the US market, and earned $53 million which is not a huge amount of money. There is an argument for saying that perhaps the Rest of the World should have been the focus for Polygram. Four Weddings was also in many ways a one-off, it had brilliant script from Richard Curtis who has been unable to recapture that magic with his subsequent efforts.\n\nIf you read George Lucas&apos;s book Blockbusting you notice that even seemingly successful films like Mission Impossible II end up losing money. The Dutch company that abandoned Polygram was probably making a prudent business decision. \n\nMany British journalists and film people believe that if someone is nominated for an Oscar, they become serious players in the U.S. The Oscars are different. Oscar voters tend to be fair and generous but they also have intellectual pretensions so they reward serious Indie movies. Winning Oscars doesn&apos;t make you a star in America or guarantee box office success. Vince Vaughn, Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell will never win Oscars, but they make mainstream Hollywood hits. Foreigners should realize they will only ever be bit players in Hollywood and make the most of it.\n\nI have heard variations of the Polygram story before, it is just the characters that are different.",

Could be made into a forty minute short movie and look much better.\n\nAnyway, don&apos;t waste your time on this.

      "name": "Creative 80s barbarian movie",
      "reviewBody": "Following &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, there were a lot of Barbarian trash movies in the 1980s. The best of them all was &quot;Beastmaster&quot; because it had creative production design, colorful photography and even some ideas of its own. Dar, the Beastmaster (Marc Singer), can see through the eyes of animals and command them whenever he needs help. The evil priest Maax (Rip Torn) holds Dar&apos;s father, the king, prisoner as well as the slave girl Kiri (Tanya Roberts) whom Dar fell in love with. In this action-packed movie, we meet a lot of bizarre folks, like the scary batmen who can suck their victims dry if they catch them under their wings (and still these are some of the good guys!) or the berserkers who carry green worms in their brains to drive them crazy. Director/script writer Coscarelli was also in charge of the very successful horror movie &quot;Phantasm&quot;, and that shows in the darker scenes. Tanya Roberts looked so good in rags she went on to make &quot;Sheena&quot; with equally little to wear. Marc Singer&apos;s muscles were memorable enough to get him signed many years later for 2 sequels which weren&apos;t half as good as the original, but still way better than the politically correct TV series 20 years later. \n\nComparing the 113 minutes &quot;director&apos;s cut&quot; (British DVD) to the old 91 minutes German video tape version, these are the most important scenes previously omitted: 1) 8 1/2 minutes of introduction, in which we learn how Maax was threatened by the king, hears the prophecy about the king&apos;s unborn son and asks a witch to abduct the baby (from his mother&apos;s womb!). Probably it was felt it takes too long until we see the grown-up hero. The disadvantage is that we know less in the short version about Maax and his motives. 2) Still in the first third of the movie, a funny scene was cut in which Dar falls into quicksand, needs help from the animals - and rescues one of them in return. This scene is a charming illustration of the beginning of his friendship with the animals, but not necessary to understand the story. 3) In the last third of the movie, 3 scenes were cut in which the injured young prince is carried into a house, gets better and receives a gift from the Beastmaster. It seems this was cut as it slows down the movie and gives information about the boy only - who is not one of the main characters, anyway. There are also smaller cuts along the way, sometimes due to violence. Anyhow, go get &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; in this longer version!",

The message is, &quot;Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you won&apos;t get left behind at the rapture.&quot; There was no love. I guess when you get right down to it, I don&apos;t believe in the god portrayed in this film. The guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like Count Dracula.\n\nAside from the spiritual/religious element, the script was tedious--saying the same thing over and over. That might have been to make up for some of the acting, which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over.\n\nI did enjoy the final scenes. I thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a Sunday School formula. The movie wasn&apos;t all bad, just most of it.\n\nI am in favor of more clean movies that are well-done and that present truth in a non-preachy way. This wasn&apos;t one of those, I am sorry to say. I took my family to this film, wanting to support that kind of movie. Now I&apos;d like my money back.",

To watch this as it was originally intended- the work of some of Italy&apos;s finest directors- is a joy. As for which segment is the best... it&apos;s hard to say...Fellini&apos;s segment is better than I remembered it...and who could ever forget Anita Ekberg...in truth I have a fondness for all these Italian films I saw in my youth that makes objectivity hard.P.S.: Of course, the same must be said for Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow-also reissued- I nearly cried at how good the print was."

      "reviewBody": "A civilization is a tree whose branches expand to the world while deeply rooted in the motherland, the one place where we cease to be a stranger. But there are eternal strangers who never belong to the place they live in, we call them Nomads, Romani or Gypsies. They have a culture, a language, a music (and how!) and while there might not be a place, there will always be a &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;. \n\nOn Youtube, an Internet user said about that scene where a devastated Perhan drowns his sorrow in booze and music: &quot;I don&apos;t understand what he&apos;s singing but it&apos;s like I understand everything.&quot; That&apos;s exactly how emotionally affecting Emir Kusturica&apos;s movies are and his 1988 masterpiece that won the Cannes Prize for Best Directing is no exception. Kusturica&apos;s movies are culturally specific but universally cathartic. Universal to a certain extent... even if it&apos;s set somewhere in Yugoslavia, this is a film about the gypsies, perhaps the most misunderstood if not disdained people on Earth, connected to many infamous caricatures from stealing chicken to prostitution.\n\nAnd it says a lot when the main character is the fruit of the passion between a Slovenian soldier and a gypsy mother who died after giving birth to his sister a few years later. Perhan, to name him... and to call a spade a spade, is a bastard, but Kusturica almost gives this word a touch of nobility, as if it captured the existential status of gypsies, they have traditions and pride but they don&apos;t know where they&apos;re from, they belong to the present, and their greatest tragedy is to keep on longing for a past so unknown and so far it is deemed to carry a shadow of mystery. Perhan is mysterious in his own way, a young and nerdy insecure boy with a talent for accordion, a turkey for a companion and a telekinetic power. \n\nHe was raised by his grandmother, the kind of stereotypical gypsy woman whom you&apos;d give her palm and trust whatever she says about your future but there&apos;s nothing cliché about her, she&apos;s perhaps one of the most loving and endearing mother figures from any movie, she drinks, she smokes, forgives her depraved son and love her grandchildren. Ljubica Adzovic gives the kind of performances that always gets Oscar nods, it&apos;s a disgrace that she didn&apos;t win anything at Cannes, or maybe she&apos;s just too authentic for that. Still, she&apos;s as pivotal to the film as she is in Perhan&apos;s life. Perhan who falls in love with Azra but can&apos;t marry her because her mother wouldn&apos;t give her daughter&apos;s hand to a bastard. This prompts Perhan to become someone and he promises the mother that she&apos;ll soon kiss his feet. \n\nCircumstances help him when the grandmother cures the son of a rich man named Ahmed (Bora Todorovic, the band leader in &quot;Underground&quot;). Ahmed promises to take Perhan under his protections and takes his sister to a hospital in Slovenia, so she can be cured from a severe leg condition. But the film isn&apos;t much about that story than it is about the young boy who encapsulates the exhilaration and tragedy of being a gypsy. As a bastard, he&apos;s twice an outcast and ostracized in his own community, forcing him to resort to crime in order to win quick cash and become respected. And with his glasses and nerdy smile, Dujmovic bears a striking resemblance with Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Papillon&quot; or &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; while as the film progresses, his hair grow and he looks more like Hoffman or a Pacino in their prime, with that intensity in the eyes and that oddly charismatic vulnerability.\n\nThe actor committed suicide in 1999, was it drugs? The Yugoslavian tragedy? Or some secret demons he took to the grave? Whatever it was, I suspect he carried that early enough so it could translate into this performance, one of the greatest performances from a relatively unknown actor, and perhaps the most intense performance in any Kusturica film. Dujmovic is the first reason to enjoy the film or perhaps the second after the music, I saw this film 25 years ago, and I remember I was mesmerized by the themes from Goran Bergovic. I never forgot the scene where they were all floating in the river, following some ancestral ritual and the one where Perhan got drunk after realizing he would also have a bastard as a son. These two emotional peaks illustrate gypsies&apos; predestination for parties because there&apos;s so much melancholy and sadness one would rather try to forget them. \n\nAnd yet the film doesn&apos;t sugarcoat the other aspects such as prostitution or human traffic, it exposes them with some sort of cynicism on the surface but in reality a way to show that once you don&apos;t have rules, you do with what you have at hands and you&apos;re the one to set your own limitations or code of honor. The film doesn&apos;t show gypsies enjoying begging or stealing or selling children, but it finds a way to show that pride is a variable parameter, a bit like in &quot;The Godfather&quot; when you disdain Mafia but you understand why it exists. And for a culture torn between the European accordion and Oriental tunes waltz (I come from North Africa, I can tell you their dances isn&apos;t different from ours), nothing surprises me anymore. \n\nThat&apos;s who the Gypsies are, people at the crossroads of the Western and Oriental world, a marriage never bound to happen but worthy of a celebration, the film opens and ends with Kusturica&apos;s iconic leitmotif of a wedding leading to a tragedy, and yet a rebirth, a symbol reprised in his &quot;Underground&quot;. Kusturica has a unique talent to immerse you into the depths of a civilization, as if we were the objects Perhan could move with his simple wizardry, this might be an allegory of Kusturica power. It&apos;s all about moving us and making us move at the beat of a trumpet ... or fly like his smiling brides.",

      "reviewBody": "Rod Steiger gives the greatest lead-actor performance I have ever seen in the title role of the Pawnbroker. Lumet&apos;s direction strikes no false note and neither does the incredibly well-researched and painfully honest script. It&apos;s hard to believe how virtually forgotten this true masterpiece of a survivor&apos;s private hell. It shows very vividly that even those of us lucky enough to survive the camps need to be ever more rare of spirit to survive without significant trauma scars. Steiger extracts every piece of emotion from his character with a performance that exceeds all that came before it and has never been surpassed. Every aspiring actor needs to view Steiger&apos;s performance to realize how magnificent it truly is.",

What is right? What is wrong? Lin Quin is an extremely careful businessman. He has a clean family and clean life (he doesn&apos;t even smoke, not to mention drug). He is very clear-minded to the point of having a frozen heart without much feeling for the others. He knows, very rationally, all the tricks and danger of drug and drug-dealing. He knows, super-sensibly, the wants and behaviour of the drug consumers. Trafficking drug to him is only a means of accumulating wealth regardless whether it is harmful or evil. He even makes an analogy between cigarette and drug. According to the world system and world values, he is correct: as there is a demand, I supply. As the buyers (drug users) get what they want and I get what (the money) I want, we are both happy. Isn&apos;t that the world we are living in? Nick&apos;s remark at the opening and closing of the film somehow is a futile didactic statement. &quot;For long, I didn&apos;t understand why people take drug.... actually it&apos;s all because of emptiness (loneliness). And, which is more horrible? Loneliness or drug? I really can&apos;t tell.&quot; No philosophy class but loneliness kills more, for sure, more destructive than drugs.\n\nWhat touches my heart is the ending. Nick promises to continue his duty as a special agent (undercover). When loneliness comes, he also intends to take drug but at last his salvation is brought by &quot;innocence&quot; (personified by Jane&apos;s little daughter) who dumps the syringe for him. Only when we come to purity and innocence, goodness and kindness can we have a way out from evil."

The former sports announcer plays Drake McHugh as well or better than any other Hollywood actor of the period could have. He stands tall among an extremely talented group of actors, including several others who have also been underrated and never received their due by the Hollywood establishment, especially Bob Cummings and Ann Sheridan. There&apos;s also Judith Anderson of &quot;Rebecca&quot; fame; Claude Rains who first made a name for himself in a part were he was invisible through most of the film; Charles Coburn, the grand old man of 40&apos;s cinema, playing against type in &quot;Kings Row&quot; as not such a grand old man; Maria Ouspenskaya in a non-horror role; and Betty Field shines as the tortured soul, Cassie.\n\nSam Wood&apos;s magnificent direction plus the acting keep the story from slipping into soap opera melodrama. True heart-rending sentiment rather than sappy sentimentality emerges from the social and economic conflicts that mix with human kindness and cruelty in small-town America at the turn of the last century. Though there is an element of nostalgia for a vanishing America, it never becomes petty or commonplace.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Lage Raho Munnabhai&quot; , the second film in the Munnabhai series and perhaps the most eagerly awaited movie of the year at least for the people who like meaningful cinema.This one was supposed to be a sequel but it has a story of its own and its refreshingly original and no connection with the first movie except the Munnabhai and circuit and their gang. I saw the movie and was completely spellbound by it.I was glued to the screen for the entire duration and enjoyed every bit of bit.To call this movie a comedy would be wrong this one is a mix bag you&apos;ve got comedy, romance , emotions (and yes lots of them) and a beautiful script to tag along.\n\nThe entire cast is simply lovable and all have acted their part to the book. Sanjay Dutt excels in the role of Munna hes is well complemented by ever smiling Arshad Warsi as circuit who surprisingly shows his softer side in some well acted emotional scenes. Vidya Balan looks fresh and acts her part well. Boman Irani as The Punjabi builder is first rate,people get to see the various shades of his character.The supporting cast of elderly persons is also good. Dia Mirza provides glamor to the film in a brief but sweet role. Jimmy Shergill is likable in the scenes where he gets footage.\n\nBut the real star of the movie is &quot;RajKumar Hirani&quot; , yes the director of the movie. he has told the story in a very unique manner which appeals to the masses.I wont go into the details as it will spoil the fun but this man is a class apart, he has handled each and every scene with perfection be it comedy , emotional or drama brilliantly.\n\nMusic is perhaps the only weak point of this film. Though the songs blend well with the story but no songs stands out to be a chart buster. The picturisation of the songs is beautiful and visually appealing.\n\nOn the whole &quot;lage raho munnabhai&quot; is an excellent movie not to be missed. The movie will tickle your funny bone as well as bring tears to your eyes in some situations. Its unique way of story telling will find praises not only from the masses but from the critics as well. the movie has a surprise package in the character of &quot;mahatma Gandhi&quot; and the actor who&apos;s played the part suits the role well\n\nI can&apos;t wait for another outing with Munna&amp;Circuit but good things come at a price. The price here is Another Wait Till Then patience rakho &quot;MAAMOO&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "THE ASTRONAUT&apos;S WIFE / (1999) **\n\nJohnny Depp plays a NASA astronaut named Spencer Armacost who, while on a space mission, losses contact with Earth for two minutes. He and his colleague, Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes), return home to their spouses, Jillian Armacost (Charlize Theron) and Natalie Streck (Donna Murphy). Bizarre episodes begin to occur with Alex, leaving Jillian suspicious of her husband&apos;s condition. As her husband&apos;s strange behavior increases, Jillian begins to question what really happened in those 120 seconds.\n\n &quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife,&quot; written and directed by Rand Ravich, poorly executes good ideas. We have imaginative and potentially suspenseful ideas with this film&apos;s concepts behind such happenings in two minutes as Spencer and Alex are in galactic boundaries. The gradual increase in Spencer&apos;s unusual behavior depicts effective suspense-but thorough introduction of the characters does not take place, nor do we witness the key events in which the rest of the move hinges upon. Consequently, &quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife&quot; does not work.\n\nThe film&apos;s first act is full of incidences, characters, and subplots. Clearly too many things happen too early in the story. Within the first thirty minutes the production attempts to develop two separate relationships, shows us the atmosphere of a teacher&apos;s workplace, something bizarre transpires out of earth&apos;s orbit, a decision is made to resign and move to New York, a suicide takes place, a character mysteriously dies, and probably  more. I just couldn&apos;t follow the plot.\n\nI liked the eerie, supernatural overtones located throughout the production. The film is smart to reveal the right amounts of information at the precise time. There is also a certain style to &quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife,&quot; containing an elusive mood, a weirdly intriguing design, and some tense and unusual camera angles. The movie becomes more interesting as we reach the closing.\n\nCharlize Theron has been in a lot of movies lately, but &quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife&quot; is her first leading role. She seems to have come out of left field in 1997 with the comedy &quot;Trail and Error.&quot; Afterwards, she contributed larger performances in &quot;The Devil&apos;s Advocate,&quot; &quot;Celebrity,&quot; &quot;Mighty Joe Young,&quot; and most recently &quot;The Cider House Rules,&quot; and &quot;Reindeer Games.&quot; Her role in &quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife&quot; is a little more complex than her past credits, excluding her enticing and believable acting job in &quot;The Devil&apos;s Advocate.&quot; She presents the traumatized Jillian Armacost with the perfect blend of zest and tragic confusion. \n\nDepp and Theron conjure a chemistry-rich couple. The movie very clearly takes Jillian&apos;s point of view instead of allowing us to know mysteries with Spencer. This stays consistent and focused, but sometimes leaves us pondering about unexplained events.  \n\n&quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife&quot; builds for an awe-inducing conclusion through revealing and intriguing dialogue and an omnipresent undertone. The film suggests a form of extraterrestrial is behind the deaths of several characters as well as the strange behavior of Spencer, but we learn the truth  only in the end. Call &quot;The Astronaut&apos;s Wife&quot; an unusual &quot;The X Files&quot; episode featuring a cliffhanger conclusion and a supernatural climax. The movie must have appeared really exciting on script. If only more capable filmmakers would have claimed this production we may have had a real winner. Instead audiences feel disappointment and failure, potential is wasted and originality is underscored",

      "reviewBody": "One of my 3 favorite movies of all times (with &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot;). It is unfortunately not very famous. I still do not understand why. from the nationalist point of view, it describes (i) the social background of the Spanish society in the upper military and nobility class; (ii) the psychological ground of any war, (iii) both the humanity, the embitterness, the cynicism of any executioner. It is also a story, written through a teenager&apos;s eyes, called back by his father from France where he was studying, to a torn Spain between an old fashioned aristocracy and church and the people looking for democracy.He sees the calm horror of an execution camp, a sort of a training wanted by his father before sending him to the front, in order to cancel all remaining humanity in his soul. It is a prerequisite to stand the horrors of war. He is protected by his father&apos;s old friend, who is played by Jean-Louis Trintignan, a romantic story in himself.\n\nPlease try to see this movie: it is quite difficult in fact. I hoped that the DVD edition would be a rebirth to this movie, but I doubt it. It is a shame that masterpieces are not recognized for their real value. &quot;Land and Freedom&quot;, which was released at the same time, benefited from a better mediatic cover.",

Helmut is Teacher with depressed mind and living in a chewing gum routine. Sabine, his wife, is loves him, but is bored. During a holiday trip ( to the nice set of the &quot;Bodensee&quot;-lake in southern Germany ) where they traveled for the pas 12 YEARS (!! ) they meet Klaus - an old school friend of Helmut - and Helene his much younger girl friend. Klaus is completely the contrary to Helmut, vital and adventuresome. Against Helmut&apos;s mood and will Klaus and Helene brake into his calm and routinized world,and Sabine is happy about this pleasant change, seeing a chance to free Helmut and her marriage out of the lethargy, they are living in for years. Helmut is fending all their efforts to break his mental suit of armer. But in little moments you can see, how he is jealous of the life of Klaus, but he has no strength to break out.\n\nThe cast is fantastic, especially Ulrich Tukur&apos;s acting as a grown up small boy is wonderful. Also Katja Riemann acted superb, after she had bored the audience during the &apos;90th with her comedies. Ulrich Noethen is the personified depression, and Petra Schmidt-Schaller a nice new-coming actress.\n\nAnd the nice sets in the Bodensee-area next to German/Swiss border makes me think for a holiday there... but not for 12 years...",

The prominent businessman Hanns Martin Schleyer who was a member of the board of directors in Daimler Benz and leader in several employer and industry associations was kidnapped and killed by extreme-left RAF. He was formerly SS worked as an important deputy and adviser to Bernhard Adolf, one of the German economic leaders. Schleyer&apos;s uncompromising position towards workers made him a target in the West Germany.\n\nThe movie plays with different positionalities. Germany democracy is facing with a hard challenge after the WW2. If you do not know much about these events, you better read about it. The Businesman&apos;s chic funeral, his ex-SS experience and policies in the West Germany, RAF&apos;s actions are all putting you in a mixed feeling. Left and democracy are under pressure with a lack of hope. I felt like RAF was representation of this hopelessness. \n\nIt is a very simplistic semi-documentary but very successful. End of the movie was very moving with the song &quot;A Tu Salud&quot;. I highly recommend you to see it. Despite you may not know much about Germany or the specific context, it has a lot of relevance to today&apos;s democracy and freedom problems.",

      "reviewBody": "Assassinio sul Tevere (1979) delivers a classic Italian crime drama infused with nostalgic charm and a touch of comedy, yet it falls short in several areas, meriting a solid 6/10.\n\nThe film, directed by Bruno Corbucci, stars the charismatic Tomas Milian as Nico Giraldi, an unorthodox and streetwise cop navigating the murky waters of crime in Rome. Milian&apos;s performance is the film&apos;s highlight, effortlessly blending humor with grit, making Nico a likable and engaging protagonist. The supporting cast, including Bombolo as the bumbling sidekick, adds a layer of comedic relief that keeps the tone light and entertaining.\n\nCinematographically, Assassinio sul Tevere captures the essence of 1970s Rome, with its bustling streets and scenic views along the Tiber River. The setting becomes a character in itself, enhancing the film&apos;s nostalgic appeal. The soundtrack, though dated, complements the era, immersing the audience in the film&apos;s world.\n\nHowever, the film&apos;s plot is where it stumbles. The murder mystery at the heart of the story is intriguing but suffers from a lack of coherence and pacing issues. At times, the narrative feels disjointed, with subplots that seem to meander without clear purpose. The humor, while enjoyable, occasionally undermines the tension, detracting from the suspense that a good whodunit requires.\n\nThe production values also show their age, with certain technical aspects, such as editing and special effects, feeling noticeably outdated. This might add to the film&apos;s charm for some viewers but can be a distraction for others seeking a polished cinematic experience.\n\nOverall, Assassinio sul Tevere is a mixed bag. It offers a delightful trip down memory lane with memorable performances and a vibrant depiction of 1970s Rome, but its narrative flaws and dated production can&apos;t be overlooked. It&apos;s worth a watch for fans of vintage Italian cinema and Tomas Milian enthusiasts but may not satisfy those seeking a tightly woven mystery thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "Till Schweiger is unfortunately one of those German directors who seem to &quot;engineer&quot; their movies in order to cater to a maximum degree to a certain target audience. By that I mean that he takes some simple ingredients that he knows will please the audience and loosely connects them to form a film.\n\nHe was clearly trying to sell this flick to women, so he took cute children, romance and jealousy, a main character discovering his responsibility in life (an invariant in films by Schweiger), inhibited erotic scenes and some stupid, below-the-belt kind of jokes and glued them together to an incoherent, predictable and largely non-entertaining collage.\n\nSometimes, the results of Schweiger&apos;s industrial film-making approach can be decent, as can be seen with Barfuss. Here however, the plot is just mundane to the point of being non-existing, the jokes are embarrassing and contrary to the first film, even the children are portrayed in such an unrealistic way that they don&apos;t convey any of the desired cuteness anymore.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out before me, the production company probably only wanted to make a quick buck with this, following up on the success of Keinohrhasen. If you think that you like a film formed from the above-mentioned ingredients than you should probably watch Keinohrhasen instead - it&apos;s exactly the same, only with a slightly better plot.",

      "reviewBody": "When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it wasn&apos;t long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero&apos;s big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.\n\nSo the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget. To be fair, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. It&apos;s not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggest.\n\nVeteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you don&apos;t remember any of his roles) leads the way as Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist who, along with his crew, gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap. He&apos;s left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly turn invisible, while her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), may now ignite himself at will. Then there&apos;s poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy, orange rock.\n\nJust as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this, they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos. It seems Reed&apos;s old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) is living up to his name, and that villainous Jeweler (Ian Trigger) isn&apos;t exactly helping old ladies cross the street, either. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; like any superhero movie, it&apos;s just a question of how and when.\n\nWhat&apos;s striking about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. The dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. The acting is so unpolished it makes a third-rate afternoon soap opera look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget, but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. When The Human Torch fully ignites his body, for instance, the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon. I can just hear that production meeting. &quot;Oh, no one will notice. They&apos;ll be too intrigued by the action!&quot; I mean really, a cartoon? At least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string! Prior to that, the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens-in-the-backyard fare. The crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely-spaceship-like object on fire. That&apos;s the only remnant of such a major disaster?\n\nOf course there wasn&apos;t a whole lot to work with in the script. There is a fairly coherent story here, but it&apos;s all so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into outer space, they simply drop by the Storms&apos; house and ask if they&apos;d care to join them. Is it really that easy? Don&apos;t these sort of things require, oh, I don&apos;t know, years of training and expertise? Not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in FULL HOUSE reruns. But as bad as that may be, nothing can compare to how painfully clichéd Dr. Doom is. He was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s, right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks. No comic book, least of all Fantastic Four, has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional.\n\nUltimately, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because it&apos;s just so damn innocent. You can tell the people involved, as little talent or experience as they had, really tried. They didn&apos;t know the final result would be so embarrassing. They were under the impression that this was their big break, that people would flock to the theaters. It bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with (and I&apos;m sure half of that was eaten up by the cool Thing costume). All things considered, they did well, and for its many flaws, the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans.",

      "reviewBody": "After 50 years of Chinese occupation, Tibet has lost most of its unique history, culture, language, and spiritual way of life. More than a million Tibetans have died under the Chinese occupation as a result of torture, starvation, and execution. Today, Tibetan people are denied most rights guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights including the rights to self-determination, freedom of speech, assembly, movement, expression and travel. There have been many films about the distressing events happening in Tibet but perhaps none as powerful as What Remains of Us, a Canadian documentary shot entirely in Tibet that allows us to witness the heartbreak from the Tibetan people themselves. Eight years in the making, it was voted the most popular Canadian film at the 2004 Vancouver International Film Festival. The only chance you will have to see this film if it is playing at a theater near you. For security reasons, it will never be released on video or DVD.\n\nFilmmakers Francois Prevost and Hugo Latulippe joined with Kalsang Dolma, a Tibetan exile living in Quebec to bring a message from the exiled Dalai Lama to ordinary Tibetans. Dolma smuggled into Tibet videotape containing a message from the Tibetan spiritual leader urging his people to be true to the Buddhist ideals of compassion for your enemies and to continue their peaceful resistance. Participants were warned that there might be potential persecution for those who watched the video if the Chinese authorities should obtain the film and recognize them. Dolma takes the tape to peasant farmers, sex trade workers, families and friends crowded around the tiny screen, as many see an image of the Dalai Lama for the first time.\n\nSome cry, others pray, many shake and all at first are speechless, unable to speak. When they do, some offer expressions of joy, some hope, others cynicism and despair but all express gratitude to the Dalai Lama. What Remains of Us is not just another special plea for an oppressed minority. It is a powerful experience that could be just as true for Native Americans, indigenous Canadians, and for all languages and cultures threatened by the onslaught of globalization. What Remains of Us allows us to understand not only how much Tibetans have lost but how much of our own humanity is in danger if indigenous cultures disappear. We may have to ask the question -- what remains of us? to ourselves.",

      "reviewBody": "A small Quebec town is rattled by a series of anonymous poison pen letters. Preminger takes a stab at Clouzot&apos;s LE CORBEAU (Clouzot himself being one of the finest purveyors of European noir, including LES DIABOLIQUES, THE WAGES OF FEAR and QUAI DES ORFEVRES). I don&apos;t recall the original very well, but I do know it had a more biting, cynical edge to it (as well as overt references to abortion, which of course was verboten under the Hays code) as opposed to the moodier tones found here. The subject matter is ripe for common noir themes like the fragility of civilized society and the darkness lurking beneath pleasant facades. Every performance is quite good, especially Michael Rennie and the sultry-as-ever Linda Darnell. The film keeps you guessing and keeps you interested, never playing a hand too soon. Although my copy was rather blurry, I could still appreciate the artful framing and use of light. The score is the weakest aspect, often laying on the strings too thick. Otherwise, quite a fine film.",

      "reviewBody": "Following on the release of The Ark of Truth, Continuum is the second Stargate SG-1 movie to come to DVD. Unlike Ark of Truth, Continuum is not potentially weighed down by having to overtly tie up loose ends left by the series. While, in fact, it does tie up a few loose ends rather nicely it also does something else: it brings Stargate SG-1 full circle.\n\nThe plot is classic SG-1: the last of the system lords Ba&apos;al (played by the ever villainous Cliff Simon) is about to be executed with SG-1 and Jack O&apos;Neill in attendance. Suddenly people start disappearing and SG-1 members Daniel Jackson, Samantha Carter, and Cameron Mitchell flee through the Stargate to a world where the Stargate never made it to America just before World War II thanks to Ba&apos;al meddling with history. After facing alternate versions of people they know and being dismissed, Earth comes under attack from Ba&apos;al, his queen Qetesh (aka Vala) and his first prime Teal&apos;c. The team must find out how Ba&apos;al changed history and put it rightor else. Writer Brad Wright brings together two of the series&apos; best threads: time travel and the threat of Goa&apos;uld invasion together to bring the series not only full circle but what could also be called SG-1&apos;s greatest hits.\n\nOne of Continuums biggest pluses is that it brings the original cast back together. Richard Dean Anderson appears once again as General Jack O&apos;Neill and while he does not appear in the entire film, his presence his certainly welcome and makes for a great addition to the film. Also returning for this film is the SGC&apos;s original leader, General Hammond. The late Don S. Davis makes his final appearance as Hammond in the film&apos;s alternate time line and while it&apos;s a shame that he doesn&apos;t know the team in those scenes, his appearance (like O&apos;Neill&apos;s) is a welcome addition to the film.\n\nThe big thrill of Continuum is watching familiar characters in the alternate time line. It is here more then anywhere else that the film brings the series full circle. We get to see the Goa&apos;uld system lords back together again even SG-1&apos;s first nemesis Apophis in a surprise appearance. On top of the alternate versions of Teal&apos;c, Vala, Hammond, and O&apos;Neill we get to meet alternate versions of Hank Landry and President Henry Hayes. Landry is played masterfully by Beau Bridges who is able to make the lines between the &quot;real&quot; and alternate Landry&apos;s almost indistinguishable. Hayes, played by William Devane and last seen in SG-1&apos;s seventh season finale Lost City, is much the same as the &quot;real&quot; version we&apos;ve met before; skeptical at first and then forced to face the incredible with a brave face. Their appearances are what separates Continuum from Ark of Truth and marks an improvement.\n\nThe film also makes a fine blend of the cerebral and action sequences. While ostensibly an action story, Continuum also takes moments to explore, on the personal level, the effects of seeing a world and people you know be almost completely different. Yet when the film needs action it has action from submarines rising in the Arctic, to dogfights and gun battles the film shows what SG-1 could be at its best: intelligent and yet action packed.\n\nThe stand-out aspects of Continuum are the amazing location photography, special effects, and music. The location filming in the Arctic (done in below zero temperatures) is amazing, beautiful, and breathtaking all at once. Considering this is a relatively low-budget film it&apos;s an incredible addition and it makes the film feel even bigger in scope and scale. Scope and scale are the purpose behind another one of the film&apos;s highlights: the special effects. From dozens (if not hundreds) of Goa&apos;uld ships to dogfights and extensions and additions to sets, the special effects in Continuum continue SG-1&apos;s proud tradition of bring feature film quality effects to the small screen. Then there&apos;s Joel Goldsmiths&apos; score which like Ark of Truth evokes the epic feel of the film. Each of these make Continuum stand head over heals above many of the direct-to-DVD sci-fi films released all the time.\n\nContinuum is not only an excellent addition to SG-1 but brings the series full circle. From classic elements to the return of favorite characters and villains to outstanding photography, effects, and music Continuum takes what could have been a boring attempt to tie up the loose ends of the series and creates a action packed adventure. Continuum may well the end of SG-1 and if it is, Continuum is it going out on top.",

The movie is an insight into the lives of those who lived the rural exodus that started in the 1960s, an exodus that saw millions leave the rural areas of Portugal, where poverty was rampant, in search for a better life in the city or abroad. Following the story of a young man who goes to work in Lisbon and meets a young girl working as a maid, also a former villager form the rural interior, it illustrates just how scary and dangerous a city can be for the rural uneducated folk. Made during the dictatorship, this is clearly a movie made with a very low budget. Still, the good acting and cinematography, accompanied by the excellent soundtrack by Carlos Paredes, makes for a worthwhile experience. Unmissable.",

Also, from her point of view, this officer incorporates all she loves in her poetry and literature: rough and manly but also protective. She immediately feels this is an opportunity for her to put into practice all she has read about.\n\nOut of her usual environment she finds it dangerous but also feels the excitement of the moment.\n\nQuite cliché all. It is a simple detective story. The characters remain shallow. There is not depth in them and they do not evolve in any way.\n\nI thought Jane Campion would do a much better job. Alas, even she makes mistakes. \n\nWhat really annoyed me were all the references to &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; by Virginia Woolf. All this quasi literism makes this film swanky.\n\nI rated this movie a 6. Disappointing for Jane Campion. But not the worst movie I ever saw. There were some nice shots.",

My favorite scene is when Gunther looks for a bottle of Coke and is overwhelmed by &quot;Coke with sugar, Coke without sugar, Coke with caffeine, Coke without caffeine, Coke with caffeine without sugar ... In Germany you only have one choice - Coke!&quot; This was absolutely true! The reviewer who thought Gunther was saying his car runs on &quot;tubers&quot; is wrong. Gunther is saying &quot;Rueben&quot; which is the German word for Turnips. A car that runs on turnips is funnier than a car that runs on potatoes! &quot;Driving Me Crazy&quot; can be compared to &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; (which I also like) in terms of comedy. Don&apos;t expect Woody Allen-type humor. Pretend you&apos;re back in junior high to enjoy this movie the most.",

Perhaps best known for Mars Needs Women, The Naked Witch and TV re-makes of AIP drive-in classics, Buchanan was responsible for this quickly and cannily lensed piece of exploitation shot in Malibu State Park and &quot;dressed&quot; as Africa.  Of main interest to fanboys is the presence of the exaulted Barbara Leigh as the wife of an unscrupulous profiteer.  A knowing finger on the pause/slow advance button on the remote about 45 minutes into the movie will prove why she is so venerated.\n\nThe story is not really worth detailing; just the elements that are intriguing or shocking:  Stuart Lancaster plays his usual lecherous self, Barbara Leigh gets raped not once, but twice (and quite unnervingly, too), the young bride breast-feeds a &quot;near man&quot; baby, and the recurring &quot;Ape Woman/Ape Love&quot; song that completely undermines any serious consideration of the subject matter.  I mean, this is BAD 70s white-boy funk.  Finally, the miscogenation of the lead actress with one of the &quot;near men&quot; is enough to raise some eyebrows.\n\nThe dialog--as is usual for a Buchanan opus--is priceless and quoteable. To detail these joys would be gilding the lily of audience investigation...\n\nMy source is an OOP video from Pan-Canadian (cover by Boris Vallejo!)"

      "reviewBody": "In 2020, Douglas feels he needs a break from the day to day life and goes to Total Recall  where memories are planted in your head to make you think you are someone else for a while  a holiday in your head if you will.  However before he can be injected he begins to have flashbacks and suddenly finds that people are trying to kill him and that somehow he must get to Mars to uncover the reasons.  However what is truth and what is fake and is the whole thing really happening or not?\n\nBased on a Phillip K. Dick story this was always going to be intelligent  however it&apos;s surprising that Verhoeven manages to keep that core well.  The plot allows his excessive violence but is also a great story that more than holds the interest with twists and turns and neither Douglas or us fully knowing what&apos;s going on.  The action is great  even 10 or so years on, and the tension just stays solid throughout.\n\nSchwarzenegger does his usual invincible muscles stuff and looks happy blasting crowds, but he is also OK in other areas too.  Tictin is good but never repeated this success for herself.  The baddies (or maybe not?) are the best roles  solid baddies like Ironside and Cox are just as good as they were in other similar roles and Sharon Stone is good as Douglas&apos; wife.\n\nOverall this continues Verhoeven&apos;s trend of making ultra-violence and clever plots and satire work well together (Robocop, Starship Troopers and this) as opposed to his trend of making trash!  Everything about this film works well  whether it be the action or the acting or the plot  a surprisingly nice package for a violent action movie!"

You felt like they were really longing for each other and their relationship felt honest (despite the premise of the movie) and real. The movie really tugs at your heart-strings in a disarming way.\n\nThe scenery was simple, youthful and not flashy, which was perfect. The scene on the beach was beautiful. The whole movie felt like it was shot through a lens of sepia, blissful nostalgia.\n\nThe movie was very thoughtful and accurate in the way that it dealt with Mel&apos;s confusion regarding her sexuality and gender identity. Her discomfort and inner-turmoil was captured well and felt authentic and to lesbian/female-to-male transgender experiences.\n\nMinor Spoiler:\n\nThe only thing that caused me a bit of discomfort when watching this movie was the age-gap between Mel and Jenny. It was easy to root for Mel as the movie is mostly shown from her perspective. However, when the age-gap between them was revealed near the end of the movie, I felt a bit cheated. I found myself struggling to justify why Mel would pursue a 16 year old. For that reason, I was left with a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth and less sympathy for Mel.\n\nNevertheless, this was a good movie that touched on a lot of subjects thoughtfully. I think I also enjoyed it because it was a drama heavy on conversation and relationships between characters.",

She was falsely accused of plotting to kill her rivals and ordered to drink poison by the king. The circumstances of her death were kept a secret until King Young San found out by accident. Upon his discovery, he was seized with sorrow and rage, and put to death or exiled anyone who was responsible of his mother&apos;s death. Even those those who didn&apos;t strongly oppose her execution were put to death.\n\nAlthough he is portrayed as a terrible dictator, his love for his mother and the terrible pain her death caused adds an extra dimension to his tyrannical reign.\n\nIt is interesting to note (according to the movie) his bringing the clowns into the palace and having them perform those skits was what drove his ministers into a rebellion.",

I love old cars and have never been to Europe, let alone Russia so I jumped at the chance to see the old Volgas when new (nearly every car in sight) and the scenes of everyday life in a Russian city back then. No Volgas in Australia that I know of.\n\nMovie contrasts the corruption in daily life at the time, with a local volunteer acting/playhouse project where the playhouse boss says the best actors are the ones that have another job (not professional actors).\n\nThe main character is employed in insurance sales (an industry that is virtually the worlds biggest corruption industry), he is funny because he is quite inept and comical, but keeps committing the car stealing crimes in an attempt to level the playing field of life in the community. His family are very confused by his actions.\n\nI enjoyed the movie very much.",

I don´t know how bad the circumstances at some American schools really are, but I think &quot;187&quot; is much more realistic than liars like &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;. Kevin Reynolds also did a great job as director. In the whole film there are no spectacular things happening, but it is suspense-packed and dramatic from beginning till the end. Also the photography and the score are excellent, because they reflect the depressive and hopeless situation perfectly. The &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;-like showdown and the desperate speech of Rita at the end will keep you sitting on the chair, left deep impressed and considering, while the whole film is already over for a long time.

Sean Patrick Flanery plays a timid fellow who, after being targeted by a sexy, devilish bloodsucker (Charlotte Ayana), seeks help anywhere he can, broadcasting his predicament via HAM radio (maybe not the most effective outlet) to anyone who will listen. It just so happens that there is a grizzled old vamp hunter out there played by Michael Biehn, a jaded hardass who&apos;s just waiting for signs of these creatures. Ayana likes to play with her prey, and taunts both of them throughout the film in some amusing cat and mouse games, forcing Flanery to great lengths of survival including building one hell of a cage in his basement to trap the bitch. The material is treated mostly head on with just a smidge of smirking deadpan, especially in the sly ending. Biehn is awesome as the cranky, high strung vamp slayer, really having fun in the role. A fun, if slight little flick."

      "reviewBody": "Harold Lloyd&apos;s last Silent effort is also one of his best vehicles: as ever, production values transcend its simple, comedic nature - the film is particularly relevant as a time-capsule for its view of 1920s New York City - while the narrative itself is filled with enough engaging subplots to please just about everybody - Harold&apos;s failure to keep a job for long (we see him, hilariously, as a soda-jerk and a cab driver), his passion for baseball (replacing the game of football celebrated in Lloyd&apos;s earlier THE FRESHMAN [1925] and even featuring a cameo by one of its legendary exponents, Babe Ruth, as himself), not to mention an outing with his girl (Ann Christy - okay, if not quite in the same league as regulars Bebe Daniels, Mildred Davis and Jobyna Ralston) at Coney Island.\n\nThe main plot, however, concerns a gang of big-city crooks intent on buying out Christy&apos;s grandfather (who owns the last operating horse-drawn cart in town); this eventually results in two wonderful set-pieces: the lengthy brawl between the villains and the team Lloyd rallies to resist them, a bunch of mangled but enthusiastic Civil War veterans, and the exhilarating final chase in which Harold ultimately makes good by bringing in the horse-cart on time against all odds - a tour-de-force in the style of Lloyd&apos;s climaxes for both GIRL SHY (1924) and FOR HEAVEN&apos;S SAKE (1926). Incidentally, the ousting of an old-fashioned means of transport was also the theme of one of Ealing Studios&apos; classic British comedies, THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT (1953), not to mention one of Luis Bunuel&apos;s Mexican films, ILLUSION TRAVELS BY STREETCAR (1954).\n\nTragically, director Ted Wilde - who had also guided Lloyd through his finest movie ever, THE KID BROTHER (1927) - died of a stroke at the young age of 36 the year after he made SPEEDY but not before receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Direction of a Comedy Picture, the only time an award of this sort was handed out by the Academy.",

      "reviewBody": "John Peel famously said that Italian War Films are &quot;Always different, always the same&quot;, and Brothers In War is just that. Usually you have a bunch of soldiers either stuck behind enemy lines or deliberately going behind enemy lines on some mission (like Five for Hell, Thunders Squad, War Bus, etc) and in Brothers In War we do have a bunch of folk behind enemy lines, only this time only two of them are soldiers, and one of them is the biggest jerk in the world. The other two is a stripper and her manager who seem rather surprised when the VC attack the camp they are performing at and waste loads of GIs.\n\nTwo soldiers are given the task of escorting the stripper and her manager to a safer environment, but the problem is they are really really bad at it. Not only do they get lost, but two of them fall into a pit trap and the jerk guy, who is constantly ignoring everyone&apos;s cries for help even when under fire, takes the opportunity to rape the stripper and run of into the jungle.\n\nSo that leaves three to carry on our strange war movie. After much wandering about, I started to get the feeling that the budget for this particular film may have been low even by late eighties Italian film standards, but things pick near the end after some characters get captured and the stripper gets raped about three or four hundred times (plus one consensual moment with our hero while hip deep in a punji cage, through the bars, with a dead guy nearby – romantic! This is after them singing jingle bells to drown out the screams of other prisoners). We eventually get full blown jungle war standards including exploding bamboo huts! Loads of Filipino actors falling over! Errmore exploding huts! Although too rape orientated for my taste it&apos;s still something you&apos;re going to want to see, provided you actually get the urge to watch late eighties Italian war movies at all. Definitely a strange one, like a four character play where the characters periodically blow the crap out of a bunch of bad guys.\n\nNice freeze frame ending. What would I do without them?",

      "reviewBody": "Phase IV is not your average movie experience.  Definitely not for everyone, so, see it if you get the chance (Last I saw it was a 1997 airing on The Sci-Fi Channel.) and decide if it&apos;s for you.\n\n      It&apos;s even hard to generalize WHAT the movie is about.  On the surface, a colony of ants has gained a heightened level of intelligence and has apparently decided to drive out the local people.  A group of surviving scientists, who were examining the ant phenomenon, rescue a wandering woman, and they become &quot;trapped&quot; in the &quot;laboratory.&quot;  The lead researcher then goes nutters over trying to determine what the ants are doing and getting nowhere because, well, ants and humans just aren&apos;t natural conversationalists.  And the story ends... well, it just ends.  What did the ants want?  Did they take over the woman&apos;s body at the end?  Did they the one surviving scientist, or, did he &quot;join&quot; them, just come to reason with them, what?  Plus, what ARE the other three &quot;Phases?&quot;\n\n      Now, I first saw this film on Beta in 1985 and on VHS many time since, the last being the aforementioned 1997 airing.  I&apos;ve read the reviews here, and, WHERE are people getting the alien intelligence taking over the ants from?!  I&apos;ve been watching this movie for 15 plus years, and, I can&apos;t recall any aliens mentioned.  An alien influence on the ants WOULD make a bit more sensical motivation for the ants, but, I don&apos;t recall this stated even as a theory anywhere in the movie.  I welcome anyone to e-mail me and let me know where it is in the film, because, I may have just failed to catch it.\n\n      So, why would I recommend it?  This movie manages to effectively pull you into the story without any of the excess baggage one would expect from a nature gets its revenge picture.  No drawn out &quot;battle&quot; sequences, like &quot;Empire Of The Ants.&quot;  The event has happened, so, there&apos;s no need to express it with cheap special effects.  The story hinges instead on the aftermath, how people deal with it, the scientific community&apos;s response, all the time presenting a prevailing air of mystery as to why the ants did it. The casual viewer will be disappointed by its rather quizzical ending because it doesn&apos;t &quot;resolve&quot; the question of what the ants want or were doing in a clean cut package.  In fact, it doesn&apos;t GIVE an answer.  It opens up the floor to debate, so to speak, where your own questions about it allow you to formulate your own &quot;message&quot; from the ending.  Can we live with the ants?  Can the ants live with us?  Do either sides want to? \n\n\n\n     Many would also find this film boring because of the lack of &quot;action&quot; sequences until the end, pretty much summed up when the nutter scientist is consumed in a pit of ants.  Instead, the film builds up suspense with effective small shots of the ants themselves.  Ants moving through technical equipment to &quot;sabotage&quot; it.  Ants moving through their tunnels, reflecting a genuine &quot;sinister&quot; sense, a sort of &quot;What are they planning, if anything?&quot; atmosphere.  Ants moving over furniture, people.  Nothing over done with an army of ants crawling all over the place, people screaming as they drown in a flood of insects (Save the one scientist, I suppose.)  It doesn&apos;t dumb itself down with exploitive action sequences.\n\n      In the end, the film doesn&apos;t insult a viewer&apos;s intelligence.  IF someone doesn&apos;t get anything out of about it, the film just lets them be. For others, it opens up the floor with unresolved questions, but, does not hinge on them, like so many cop out endings.  You&apos;re left to reach your own conclusions, but not as a crutch, to avoid having to write an ending or a low budget, etc.\n\n      An interesting film if you can ever find it.  If you do, watch it and decide for yourself.  It&apos;s one of the few movies made that lets you choose whether to like it or not, and goes along with that."

      "reviewBody": "On October, 18th 1986, on the sixtieth birthday of Chuck Berry, there was a concert at the Fox Theater in his hometown Saint Louis. This documentary highlights some of the best moments of this concert, with footages of Chuck Berry playing his famous songs with a unique band composed by Keith Richards, Johnnie Johnson, Bobby Keys and other great musicians and the participation of Linda Ronstadt, Julian Lennon, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton and Etta James among others famous guests. In this tribute, there are also many interviews and archive footages with Chuck Berry&apos;s parents and siblings, and artists like Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bruce Springsteen, Roy Orbinson, Keith Richards, The Everly Brothers, John Lennon, Eric Clapton among others. There are many compliments, praise and recognition of his magnificent work from the interviewees; however there are also many obscure moments that deconstruct the idol. For example, Bruce Springsteen tells about Chuck Berry&apos;s concern with money and no rehearsal with the unknown local pick up bands before his gigs without any respect to the audiences and fans. Keith Richards is extremely ambiguous, and tells about the free physical aggression he suffered from Chuck Berry; and playing out of the rehearsed tune. Further, I understood that some of his famous songs actually were composed by Johnnie Johnson, and the keys adapted by Chuck Berry to the guitar. He manipulates many questions, like for example for his wife, and never mentions that he went to jail for tax evasion. Therefore it is a wonderful documentary of Chuck Berry as a player and singer; but regarding his behavior out of stage, I would dare to write that he seems to have at least a weird and egocentric personality. Therefore better off would be watching the concert without the additional footages. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Chuck Berry Hail! Hail! Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll&quot;",

I still love it. It&apos;s nice to see a movie without a lot of toilet humour and f-bombs. The dialog is filled with memorable lines but the humour is in knowing what the characters don&apos;t and the on screen charisma of Di Vito and Middler.\n\nPay attention and you&apos;ll see the L.A. cityscape during the 80&apos;s along with all that was bad in 80&apos;s design along with Santa Monica Pier before the redesign in the 90&apos;s. \n\nGreat film for a rain day or a bad mood.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the numerous early &apos;70s sex comedies which feature mythical heroes (Maciste, Zorro, etc) engaging in sexual escapades with a series of beautiful (usually Italian) women. Yes, there are lots of naked women on offer in this movie but not really that much of a plot. Technically the film is perfect, very colourful and with excellent sets and lighting, but let&apos;s face it - who cares about the scenery when all these naked and half-naked women are on view? With this French-Italian offering, you can be sure there&apos;s not long to wait before another nubile young woman parades herself before the camera.\n\nThe lead role of Ali Baba is played as a mischievous and excitable young man by the British-born Alan Barker, who never went on to fame of any sort. However, I have to admit that he does look good in the role and probably comes closest to how most people think Ali Baba would look. As for the supporting cast, well most of the men are portrayed as bumbling idiots getting into all sorts of scrapes (complete with comedy-style music) and the women aren&apos;t exactly required to act. The plot sees Ali going from one woman to the next until he ends up falling from a window, and then some woman makes an aphrodisiac potion or something and the film ends with everybody sleeping together. This is mildly amusing stuff, but nothing to go out of your way to see, but at eighty minutes in length it never becomes boring or dull. It&apos;s just okay.",

A suitor arrives at the family home of his young lady and there is no looking back. This is a most depressing film, with absolutely every character unlikeable. I can&apos;t recall a film before when I have so taken against the two principals. She wet and manipulative and he rude and stupid, despite his intellectual and scientific abilities. Actually, towards the end when she goes even more crazy (the clue to her change is the Exorcist like spider walk sequence) she becomes a little more endearing, but not that much. The monster in the attic (who thinks he&apos;s invisible) is madly overacted but not quite to the point of becoming fun. Relentless and uncompromising it is nevertheless difficult to enjoy.",

Now that Italian political crime thriller made in 1976 and based upon a book by Leonardo Sciascia is a near faultless classic with deep undertones and a broad scope that is simply a joy to watch. This, it turns out, is another film based upon another book by Leonardo Sciascia from 1967. How much more sensible it would have been to watch this one first. The thing is there is nothing wrong with this film except it is also about too easily explained killings that the lead character sets out to investigate and in the process overturns a hornets&apos; nest, but there is much less action, intrigue and politics. Gian Maria Velonte is excellent as the professor who takes it upon himself to get involved when most people seem not to care. Interestingly this was the film that helped to lift this actor into more &apos;serious&apos; films, after having made many spaghetti westerns, one of the last being face to Face also from 1967 when he also played a professor.",

      "reviewBody": "A documentary about terrorists, where the criminals themselves confess their sins on camera, with their faces blurred so that no one can recognize them. As an idea, it&apos;s actually pretty interesting. But that&apos;s all it should have remained: an idea. The finished product, Z32, is confusing, nonsensical and, most of the time, plain boring.\n\nThe director, Avi Mograbi, structures the film like this: on one level we have the Israeli terrorist who, encouraged by his girlfriend, tapes a confession where he expresses his regret for killing two Palestinian police officers during a reprisal operation. The girlfriend testifies on camera too, on the condition that her face be unrecognizable. On the other level, we have a series of Lynchian musical interludes, staged by Mograbi himself, which have no connection whatsoever to what&apos;s being told and seem to have been inserted simply to extend the running time. There are also additional scenes where the terrorist visits the crime scene with a friend, providing further insight.\n\nArtistically speaking, the director might even have had an interesting point to make with this new, unprecedented approach to the subject of terrorism. Unfortunately, the utter pointlessness of what is said (the &quot;confession&quot; quickly turns into stream-of-consciousness nonsense) and the inexplicable interludes do nothing but alienate the audience: whereas Lynch, who pioneered this kind of scenes with Twin Peaks and brought them to extreme levels in INLAND EMPIRE, uses the surreal digressions as an organic part of the narrative (whatever that may be), Mograbi is unable to make us understand why his hybrid of Munich and The Blair Witch Project has to feature a string of gratuitous, artsy intermissions. It&apos;s as if two different, completely incompatible films met at a crossroads and merged without thinking about the consequences.\n\nGranted, this isn&apos;t the worst film ever made (those tend to be fully devoid of ideas), but its attempt to bring a new perspective on a done-to-death subject ends up being its downfall. In other words, it&apos;s too blatantly weird for its own good.",

Doesn&apos;t hurt that he&apos;s hot too, but I just think all of the acting in this film was excellent.  If you are like me, and like the Devon Sawa looks and acting, check out Final Destination and Idle Hands.  Both very well done by him as well.  I give this film a 10/10.

      "reviewBody": "Roy Rogers is The Carson City Kid, a notorious outlaw. Actually, no, it&apos;s largely he just has the reputation. He&apos;s been trailing the man who killed his brother, and has concluded it&apos;s saloon owner Bob Steele, who has just hired him as a guard. Marshall Gabby Hayes deputizes him, in case he needs to kill anyone. Meanwhile, Steele has just cheated miner out of the gold he has mined, and has proposed to saloon singer Pauline Moore, who turns him down. So Steele fires Miss and Rogers, leading to the conclusion.\n\nThe ending is a bit rushed. That might be the way it was originally released, or perhaps the four minutes cut off the original for the version I saw helped make sense. Miss Moore and Roy each sing one song, Trigger gets only a couple of minutes of screen time, and there&apos;s a well-timed horseback chase towards the end, sure to please oater fans. The story is certain more nuanced than usual for B westerns, because Roy Rogers was a rising singing cowboy star, and he and Steele get to do a little more acting than they would have down in Gower Gulch. Director Joe Kane directs this just a mite leetle too fast, as Gabby would say, but it&apos;s a decent way to spend just under an hour.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always held a special place in my heart and mind for this second installment in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie series.  Mostly, because this is a movie that appeals to both places.\n\nNot only is this movie loaded with the original characters from the series, it also touches on such subjects as revenge, family, duty, age and, of course, sacrifice.  That was the best thing about the series - that it touched on topics that were (pardon the expression) universal, no matter the species.\n\nEveryone is uniformly fine right down the line, especially Montalban&apos;s Khan (returned from the &quot;Space Seed&quot; episode of the original series); all hatred, vengeance and single-minded of desire to see his enemy laid out before him. Namely, Kirk.\n\nAlley is rather fetching as Saavik and it&apos;s a shame she wasn&apos;t carried over to the next film.  I can&apos;t help but, seeing her on TV anymore, to expect her to raise an eyebrow in contemplation.  Buttrick makes a complex character out of David, the son Kirk never knew he had.  Hurt feelings and resentment meld somewhat explosively with a new-found father/son relationship.\n\nAnd what can one say about Spock, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scotty? They are characters all of us grew up with and, pivotal to the plot at hand or not, it&apos;s always good to see them.  \n\nFor anyone who hasn&apos;t seen the movie, I won&apos;t discuss it in great detail. The story is simple enough (scientists find way to rejuvenate life on dead planets; Khan finds escape from prison planet, vows revenge on Kirk), but there is one plot point that will, if you are unfamiliar with it, blow you away.  Suffice it to say, never has friendship been elocuted so well in this or any movie before or since.\n\nTen stars and a special Kobuyashi Maru simulation for &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan&quot;.  Watch it: it&apos;ll make you feel young again.",

The dog farts got my whole family laughing as we have a boxer and boxers do have gas. I will recommend this film to family and friends next Christmas. The scene towards the end where the dog catcher lays into the rich lady lays out some nice values for the kiddos. This film has potential to be another Christmas classic. I will definitely watch it again as this is one of those movies that I could see more than once and not get sick of it.",

      "reviewBody": "This film really has nothing to do with E.T...people seem to think it was  a &apos;reaction&apos; to it...I say that maybe it made a wonderful film gem like this, a sci-fi for and starring kids, possible.\n\nFunny and inspiring. Probably the first film I ever saw with both of these qualities. I was 6 when it came out, and though it stars 3 boys, the tomboy in me came out...even as an adult (I watched it recently again) I become awed by the scenes of the boys constructing the &apos;scapeship&apos;. The writer and Dante were good about packing in little extra details, like the &quot;talking&quot; mouse, Wolfgang&apos;s strange family, the kids using walkie-talkies, the dog who chews gum, the drive-in movie, Ben writing a will, one of the kids living in a trailer, etc. Without being hokey, these tidbits add more depth and charm to a story that could&apos;ve been called a Mickey Mouse approach to E.T. These kids are older than Elliott and smarter and the film doesn&apos;t go for tearjerking scenes; EVER.  Some of the direction reminds me of Spielberg, **however... instead of this film being a kid&apos;s approach to space-travel, it&apos;s a space-travel approach to a kid&apos;s film.\n\nThen there are the aliens. Well, we feel the way the kids do about them; disappointed. But that is the point. What would you expect to see? It is kind of like the mataphorical satire of the grass being greener on the other side. \n\nI tried not to get too emotional when reading the viewer comments on this film. I do not consider myself a Yank-I like to use the term American-but being 1st generation -born here, I still consider myself part-European, and the fact that the film did better in Europe than in the States, and from what I hear- Joe Dante&apos;s apology for the film- makes me sad. This film started my fascination toward the unknown and the general sciences. I happen to be one &quot;Yank&quot; who really enjoyed this movie!"

The general idea of this movie has been done to death in Hindi movies (most recently in the Amitabh classic Hum with Kadar khan in the scientist role) but this movie not only takes the cake, it takes the kitchen! The general premise of the movie is taken from a Paul Newman / Edward Robinson classic. But whats more the title of this movie Puruskaar is a direct lift of that movie which is titled The Prize. Puruskaar is very cheap, amateurish and has really BAD acting. Besides Joy Mukherjee the movie stars I.S. Johar, Farida Jalaal and the always pleasing Faryal. Like those Biswajeet movies from yore, the hero is a secret agent trying to solve a case. I wont even go into the case... save yourself some money (or if you d......d movies, save yourself time and do not , i repeat, do not watch this movie.",

The three accept the challenge, wanting to get paid handsomely of course, but as they advance and get closer to Cardinale a thin line develops and it becomes unclear if everything is really the way it appears to be. The scope of a quickly changing West before a backdrop of the Mexican Revolution only adds to a movie that nearly touches greatness. Writer/director Richard Brooks (Oscar-nominated in both categories) began to knock on the door with a potentially very dark Western here and in 1969 director Sam Peckinpah would knock that door down with the amazing &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Brooks, not known for this genre, created a legitimate winner here with this production. Sometimes though the characters lose out because of the beautiful cinematography by Conrad L. Hall (Oscar-nominated) and the fact that Cardinale is just illuminating when on the screen (she is the only actress with any substantial screen-time). Her amazing beauty overshadows all the males throughout. Thought-provoking, action-packed and highly interesting, &quot;The Professionals&quot; is a sometimes forgotten would-be masterpiece from the usually impressive genre. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "MEET THE FOCKERS made me laugh a lot. It probably has more laughs than the original, but the laughs aren&apos;t as big or as fresh or as subtle. And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the &quot;focker&quot; puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they&apos;re having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor&apos;s also been added to the cast, and he&apos;s a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock &apos;em!",

      "reviewBody": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon.)\n\nThis movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender you don&apos;t want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman&apos;s legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank&apos;s portrayal was.\n\nI was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.\n\nThe direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don&apos;t really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure, something bad is going to happen.\n\nHilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Élodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Allen and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.\n\nVery disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it&apos;s best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.\n\nObviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an &quot;X&quot; rating as any &quot;R&quot; movie you&apos;ll ever see. It will make most viewers uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.",

But that&apos;s only true if you want to see films through the eyes of critics; and when this one came out, the critics were gunning for Bogdanovich. Why? Who knows. They were gunning for Spielberg when &quot;1941&quot; came out, the difference being that Spielberg bounced back. Bogdanovich never really did, but that doesn&apos;t make &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; a bad film. True, it has no appreciable story, but it&apos;s a nifty little love letter to the makers of those early movies; which is why it has equal parts slapstick and straight drama. It&apos;s affectionate rather than melodramatic, and has a convincing evocation of what it must have been like to be around, scuffling on the edges of fame and fortune with this weird new invention, motion pictures. It&apos;s not going to scare you, or thrill you with wall to wall CGI pyrotechnics, it doesn&apos;t have a cast of thousands, and it didn&apos;t bankrupt a studio to make it. It&apos;s a good little film, well made, solidly cast and directed, and in general, well acted. A lot of what we like in film depends on our expectations. The critics were gunning for Bogdanovich because they were expecting Art with a capital A; instead what they got were a lifelong film fan&apos;s notes. Enjoy.",

And of course the writing is so thin and predictable if it was a dress it&apos;d be see-through.\n\nI don&apos;t think it&apos;s as horrible as the first reviewer (mainly because I have been to Johannesburg and it DOES look that old an worn-out) but agree that the writing and acting was not up to par.",

Plane carrying animals goes down on an island. Japanese Soldiers appear, eventually making friends with Gould and Genieve Bujold. Two kids who were stowaways are the only reason this is a family film. I found them to be more annoying than anything, but obviously they were not going to go away. Once the plane is turned into a raft, we get the expected crisis of the minute, including a shark attack, and a storm. All ends well, and the movie is far from memorable, especially for adults. - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "A well done Technicolor story about flight training at Thunderbird Field, Arizona in 1942 at the height of WWII. Great cast of supporting players, with main stars Gene Tierney, Preston Foster, and John Sutton well suited for their roles. Beautiful flying shots with the Arizona desert as background. The dialogue in some spots is not too realistic in terms of aviation, e.g. when Preston Foster, playing the role of a civilian flight instructor at a military training school exclaims that a student&apos;s &quot;motor conked out&quot; while viewing the incident from the ground with his former sweetheart, Gene Tierney. Hilarious scene early in the movie where civilians are learning to be &quot;civilian defense&quot; first aid workers: Preston Foster, leg in cast, is loaded into an ambulance that then races away with the back door unlatched ejecting him out the back door and allowing him to fall attached to a stretcher onto the street. Touching brave sentiments portrayed by famed English actress, Dame May Whitty, on the loss of her son in combat. Jack Holt as the C.O. of the school, and Reginald Denny, as the British officer in charge of English cadets, add greatly to the overall quality of the picture, and Holt&apos;s facial expressions when he is dancing with Gene Tierney are particularly funny in the dance scene late in the picture. Peter Lawford has an uncredited bit part as a cadet in the movie. Overall, a very enjoyable movie if the viewer is interested in WWII aviation pictures, especially for the color quality.\n\nTRIVIA NOTE: Famed aviation ace Richard Bong is one of the pilots flying the formation of North American AT-6s (&quot;Texans&quot;) in the movie (uncredited), done before he shipped out to the Pacific to become the &quot;Ace of Aces&quot; by shooting down 40 Japanese planes, more than any other US pilot in WWII. (He died 8/6/45 at Burbank, California while taking off in a P-80 &quot;Shooting Star&quot; jet which lost power on takeoff.)\n\nGOOF: in the water tower scene early in movie, Preston Foster, in a trainer from the base, buzzes water-bathing Gene Tierney  and drops her his flight suit from the plane to use for cover/clothing when she gets out of the water tower. Film editing mistake shows her catching the flight suit, but then a shot of Foster&apos;s plane flying away shows the flight suit being thrown out from the plane (after she already has it!).",

      "reviewBody": "Where will you bewhat will you do and how will you protect your loved one&apos;s in a post-apocalyptic world? The sci-fi action/thriller DEADLAND plunges you into a world of martial law, and takes you along the journey of Sean (Gary Weeks) a survivor of World War III&apos;s nuclear strikes on the U.S. A pandemic reigns as many survivors were infected by a fatal nuclear plague and separated into different concentration camps by Officers of the New Provinces. The quest starts when the protagonist finds evidence that his missing wife (Emily-Grace Murray) may still be alive in the new United Provinces. His determination to find her is equal to his personal war against the cruel Officers of the New Provinces. Jax (Brian Tee) an unexpected ally brings a bit of humor to the realistic struggles in the action filled drama. DEADLAND visually demonstrates our fear as well as our hope in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nDirector Damon O&apos;Steen, and writer/producer Gary Weeks, present a fantastic post-apocalyptic thriller considering their budget. All aspects of the film were impressive with excellent cinematography, moving score, superb acting, and great direction. You will not be disappointed in this indie film that visually portrays a depressing yet hopeful future. I found this gem at the Derby City Film Festival February 2010 and loved it! -3rd Dog Script aka Betsy Malone © 2010",

A simple story told in even simpler format by Vivek Sharma touches your strings. The music is okay, so is the cinematography but what stands out is the chemistry between the duo and its fun to see an 8 year old standing and matching shoulders with the greatest actor of all times..But, in any case it&apos;s a movie worth watching this summer and might provide for some good lessons on forgiveness. As for parents, watch out for the athletic meet scene where Amitabh explains that success can be achieved only by hard work and not magic- A good lesson to be learnt...And yeah Juhi Chawla is good and so is Shahrukh Khan who is there for a few scenes..\n\nGo watch this at least its far better than the so called mindless movies dished out..Do take a few tissues with you..You might just need them but wouldn&apos;t mind nevertheless..",

      "reviewBody": "Finally... the last pieces are in place. This is where it all came together: The goofy and incompetent policeman is gone; Axel Strøbye is the criminal investigator who is neurotic, stuck in his job job and finds his younger colleagues painfully ignorant of how the police work needs to be done; Ove Verner Hansen plays a muscle-man-for-hire(though not Bøffen, yet); and the plan truly *is* brilliant. This is also the very first time they truly try something different with the opening, where Egon is released from prison after serving his time. And the Gang come closer than before to success... with a plot that surpasses any of the previous ones, several excellent plans and a pace that is thoroughly solid, this is about as good as it gets, for Danish comedy produced at that time. This contains the hilarious performance of Egon&apos;s as a German businessman and a sober(!) Dynamite-Harry. The humor is refined, sophisticated, satirical. The element of humanity is there in just about every gag and joke(there is hardly any silly humor left at all), and the film pin-points what being Danish in Denmark(of that time) was. The acting is all top-notch. Strøbye is an indispensable addition to the cast, generating proper opposition for the Gang(sure, Rico of &quot;... in Jutland&quot; was fairly professional, but he remained inferior and incompetent). The writing is great. Gone are the ridiculous mix-ups... enter instead the interesting and logical twists. The filmic language reaches a nice and steady level... setups are properly used and the film uses few, if any, weak plot items. The cinematography finds a comfortable level, with few(blatant) zooms(that aren&apos;t used for dramatic emphasis) and no wasteful shots. All in all... a grand comedy of Danish proportions, and one that has made not only millions of Danes laugh countless times(I, myself, have seen this more times than I can keep track of, as well as the later films), but also many Germans(the former Eastern Germany found the films uncontrollably funny), past and present. I recommend this to fans of comedy and of the other films in the series... and it helps a lot to, if not downright *be* Danish, at least know how things are here, especially back then. While it certainly doesn&apos;t transcend the likes of more well-produced(typically American) films, I still say that the enormous amounts of hours of entertainment for so many people earns this film a solid rating of 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Pros: 1. The bright colour palette does a wonderful job at highlighting the over-the-top nature of the film. 2. The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal. 3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes. 4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed. 5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes. 6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly. 7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances. 8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes. 9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.\n\nCons: 1. The slow-motion used is extremely unattractive and pointless. 2. There is annoying minor usage of stock action screams.",

In this one, a somewhat upper-class woman resents her more simple, middle-class husband (by arranged marriage), while also encouraging her niece to go to arranged marriage meetings. As always with Ozu, I found an awful lot to like about this movie, but I wasn&apos;t quite enamored enough to gush over it. Most of the core cast is superb, although it&apos;s not Ozu&apos;s usual team (Setsuko Hara is nowhere to be seen, although Chishu Ryu and Chikage Awashima have minor roles). Michiyo Kogure might be a little too nasty, but I have to say it&apos;s kind of refreshing to see a less restrained character in an Ozu film. Perhaps the film wraps up too nicely and neatly, going too obviously for a touching moment, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s entirely unwarranted. At any rate, I enjoyed the film with its insights and gentle humor.",

He was more of a mechanic than a filmmaker making, with Birt Acres, his own camera on which to shoot films in 1895, and also Britain&apos;s first projector, the Animatograph, with which to screen them in 1896. Early in the 20th century he had a custom-made studio built in Muswell Hill.\n\nThe Switchback Railway was the forerunner of the roller coaster. Passengers sit in a small car which trundles up a swooping railway track then performs a 180&apos; turn at its summit before swooping back down on a parallel track. As fairground rides go, it&apos;s pretty tame, but the well-dressed kids in this film seem to be enjoying it.",

And as always, they deliver, in &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; starring Zachary Scott, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Faye Emerson. Though never leaving the back lot of Warners, the film takes writer Cornelius Leyden (Lorre) through Istanbul, Athens, Sofia, Geneva, Belgrade and Paris, following the life and career of an intriguing figure - Dimitrios - whose dead body Leyden has just seen in the morgue. The more he learns about this man, the more fascinated he becomes, and he smells a great story. Dimitrios is a con man, a thief, a blackmailer, and a spy for hire, and his victims tell their stories in a series of flashbacks. One of these is a nightclub owner (Emerson), who owns a nightclub in Sofia; another is a police detective; another a spy. Finally, Cornelius meets Mr. Peters (Greenstreet) who has some startling information...and a plan.\n\n&quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; captures a European flavor with its international cast and creative sets, and director Jean Negulesco keeps the action moving. In the title role, Zachary Scott is appropriately both attractive and slithery as a man constantly eluding those out to get him. Lorre is just great, becoming more and more worried and confused as he is drawn deeper into Dimitrios&apos; adventures. Sydney Greenstreet gives a performance as big as he is as Mr. Peters - the scene where he passionately embraces French francs is one of his best ever! The last half hour or so belong to these two screen gems, Lorre and Greenstreet, and it&apos;s very exciting.\n\nTwo odd-sized, talented character men who helped keep Warner Brothers grinding out films during the war, Lorre and Greenstreet made ten films together. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t have anything like these two making movies today. Don&apos;t miss them in &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios.&quot;",

It is a picture that shook the lost generation of the late seventies and woke them up emotionally. It feels so good to look at it realizing it has lost not an ounce of its intensity. A critical look at puberty blues and young girls desires. Watch it with your children. Watch also: Story of Ricky."

Family members are sometimes uncomfortable around each other. Husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, have ups and downs in their relationships. All families remember good times and bad times and so do the Coopers.\n\nThis is not a warm and fuzzy feel good movie that you finish seeing and you are left with an uplifting feeling of happiness . What you will see is a point of view as if you are sitting at the Cooper&apos;s dinner table yourself and as hard as you might try to avoid it, you will consciously take a side with one family member over another.\n\nThis film has an all star cast and the family and spouses interactions are sometimes intense but honest in their current feelings towards each other. I especially enjoyed all of the scenes between Alan Arkin the Cooper family patriarch and his waitress actress Amanda Seyfried which take place at his favorite diner.\n\nThere are too many scenes throughout this film to mention them all but Olivia Wilde and the war veteran she meets at the airport actor Jake Lacey evolved quickly as each of them dug deep into the others psyche, and I wished there was more that we could have listened in on.\n\nI will be sure to watch this again sometime as it is one of those memorable films, not in a good way, but it may help remind us all to forgive, not forget, but to share our feelings and whatever the outcome the truth should come out. I give this dramedy a 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",

His son is the film maker and tries to display how his father was and still is perceived by his many children and their children. Even after his death and also whilst being alive. And of course their way of processing and interpreting their own memories in comparison with historic sources.\n\nWhat I liked about the movie was the very honest way of showing how the family interacts especially when discussing delicate issues. \n\nThe camera work etc. is pretty good although I was kind of surprised by some of the sound effects used. They were kind of trying to tell the viewer what to think or feel about certain frames. \n\nP.S: The other poster obviously didn&apos;t quiet get what was going on in the movie or is just to naive to understand it. at all. What I didn&apos;t like too much was the overall very small amount of prove for Ludin&apos;s involvement with crimes. I do think though that contrary to the opinion of his daughters Ludin did know what was going on. The film doesn&apos;t give enough input for me to have a founded opinion though.\n\nI do also get the impression that this film is somewhat of a self medication for the filmmaker. coming to terms with his families past and maybe even getting rid of guilt that he feels. I don&apos;t know if this comes from a narcissistic point of view or something like that but one could get that impression.\n\nRecommend movie - much better insight than most documentaries I&apos;ve seen cause it&apos;s on a very personal level that somehow everyone can relate to.",

      "reviewBody": "I went downtown to see some widescreen extravaganza at a Duplex Cinema and when I bought my ticket realized I&apos;d been standing in the wrong line. (The story of my life.) Instead of seeing some technicolorama epic I wound up seeing this, a cheap black-and-white true crime story.\n\nWell, felix culpa! I emerged shocked. At the time of its release there was nothing quite like it. Two small-time murdering cons deeply in love with one another in some twisted kind of way. Balding, overacting Tony Lo Bianco. Plumply menacing battleaxe of a nurse, Shirley Stoler. The photography is grainy and primitive. Indoor lamps don&apos;t simply cast light -- they glare. The movie&apos;s idea of a proper family home looks like something that might be owned by a worker in the Pabst Brewery in Newark. \n\nLo Bianco as Ray is a minor Latin con type, adroit with lonely women, while Stoler, as Martha Beck (great name) is the passionate one, filled with jealousy and rage. I don&apos;t know if the victims were supposed to be seen as somehow contemptible, what with their obtuseness and whining, but we never forget that we&apos;re dealing with human beings here. The first murder is relatively genteel. Death on a bus follows a poisoning. The next is bone-chilling. To appreciate the shock value of the violence a viewer needs to remember that this was filmed before all the extended gore and homicides we see now in movies like &quot;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,&quot; &quot;Atlantic City,&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain.&quot;\n\nPreviously, when the victim was whacked hard on the head with a claw hammer, he or she slumped forward, decorously dead. Not here. As in &quot;The Assassination of Trotsky,&quot; the victim is momentarily stunned, then recovers screaming. The second homicide involves the only use of a directorial touch unusual enough to draw attention to itself. The victim is lying on her back in bed while her two attackers discuss the best way to murder her. The camera concentrates on her uncomprehending and frightened eyes flicking from side to side, then a sharp pan to a pistol pressed against her head, and the sound of a shot. (A contemporary review of the film criticized one of the scenes because we could hear Ray urinating into the toilet bowl offscreen.) \n\nThe last duet of murders exceeds the limits of any sympathy we might have felt towards the lovers. Ray has promised Martha that he&apos;s not going to boff the last victim, whereas, it is revealed, he&apos;s been unfaithful -- to Martha, that is. Well, that&apos;s enough for Martha. After disposing of both her last rival and child she drops the dime on the two of them. If she can&apos;t own Ray exclusively then no one&apos;s going to have a piece of him. Ray writes her a love letter in jail. His ability to forgive is almost religious in its magnitude. Either that or he just can&apos;t stop telling lies. \n\nThis is a true story, and it has the digressions and non sequiturs we find in a real-life script. People get into unexpected and awkward arguments that are accidentally heard offscreen. Ray&apos;s sleep is constantly interrupted by Martha arguing with a victim in the next bedroom. The fact that this is based on real events make it all the more scary. Skip Freddy and the rest if you want to be scared out of your wits. Catch this instead.",

      "reviewBody": "The liberating power of rock&apos;n&apos;roll music has been the source of inspiration for many movies ever since its birth in the 1950s. Films like Almost Famous (2000), The School of Rock (2003) and That Thing You Do! (1996) can be named as English-language examples of rock movies but Sweden has produced its own stories on the subject as well. To name two, Ulf Malmros&apos; 2005 punk rock tale Tjenare kungen (a.k.a. God Save the King) makes a very nice companion piece to Reza Bagher&apos;s 2004 film adaptation of the novel Populärmusik från Vittula (a.k.a. Popular Music) that also dealt with small town kids&apos; desire to spread their wings through music.\n\nThe story, based on a 2001 novel by Britta Svensson, is set in 1984. Punk rocker girl Abra (Josefin Neldén) lives in a small town and dreams of becoming a rock star but the town&apos;s narrow-minded atmosphere is hard for rebels like her. After meeting a fellow rock fan Millan (Cecilia Wallin), Abra moves to Gothenburg and starts a band called Tjenare Kungen (&quot;Hello King&quot;) with her but nothing comes easy for the would-be rock stars: finding members for the band in an era when punk rock has gone out of fashion to make way for synth pop and glam rock, putting up with an uptight boss at a sausage factory, sorting out romantic feelings towards a handsome guy named Dickan (Joel Kinnaman)...\n\nIt can be imagined that the project has been a nostalgic one for the director Ulf Malmros who was in his late teens during the film&apos;s era. Perhaps this is why the 1980s atmosphere is so pleasantly recreated in the story: punk, rock and pop hits of the time are constantly playing, the fashion is flashy and hairstyles are as unappealing as expected. Still, everything is photographed with sunny, warm brightness that makes the film visually very pretty and youthful. The main actresses Neldén and Wallin look so cute in their roles that they can only be loved but Johanna Strömberg and Malin Morgan do their parts decently too as the self-declared fashion designer-keyboardist Gloria and the experienced older rocker chick Isa respectively. The latter is also the only significant adult character in the story; otherwise the perspective belongs entirely to the young to whom grown-ups are nothing but dead weight.\n\nThe plot is nothing strikingly original or imaginative: questions of selling out, romantic shyness, triangle drama and temporarily falling out with one&apos;s best friend are all ordinary youth flick material and would not carry the film far if it was not for the sympathetic young actors. Some scenes struck me as particularly clichéd; namely, the wedding gig (yeah, right) and the big finale (seriously, who didn&apos;t guess right away what the climax would be?). The brief saxophone jam scene was hilarious though, precisely because it was cut so short with perfect comic timing.\n\nRegarding Nordic peers of Malmros&apos; film, an obvious comparison can be made to one of my favourite Finnish movies Pitkä kuuma kesä (1999), although TK focuses on girls instead of guys and stays more clean-cut with much less alcohol use and bad language. Anyway, all things considered, Tjenare kungen is definitely an entertaining, fun and even delightful little movie, easily worth a look especially by fans of the music and fashion of the 1980s.",

      "name": "A charming and pleasant love story",
      "reviewBody": "This low budget film is a charming and pleasant love story. However, its main importance is the circumstance, that is was banned by the government of the DGR. The script is written by the well-known author Ulrich Plenzdorf (also &quot;Die neuen Leiden des jungen W.&quot;). Karla has finished her studies and gets employed in a village at the secondary school. She plans to use a radically different approach to educating, which will put great value on criticism, authenticity and autonomous learning. She also pursues a relationship of relative equality with her pupils. She is tolerant an reconciliatory, in particular with respect to a pupil who evidently opposes the political system (and even listens to the reviled western radio stations). The method alienates her from her bureaucratic colleagues, and clashes with the school curriculum. Fortunately the headmaster is an old Bolshevist, a former resistance fighter who loathes bureaucracy and supports her. He has to continuously protect her from the law-abiding school inspector. In the mean time, Karla gets acquainted with a former journalist. He is now a fisherman, because he could not bear the opportunist censorship, that undermined the credibility of his articles. The two good-natured nonconformists develop a liking for each other, in a tolerant and self-asserted fashion. For some time, Karla caves in to the demands of the school inspector and the board. She soon gets uncomfortable with this situation, feeling that she has become too careful, and as dead as a doornail. So she again picks up her original approach. Then one afternoon she makes the mistake to accompany the rebellious pupil for a stroll on the deserted beach. Not surprisingly he makes a pass at her. Indeed this is the limit, and the school inspector transfers her to another school. The film ends happily, when the fisherman/journalist joins her on the leaving train. Their cheerful natures enables them to shrug off the unpleasant experience. The verdict of the government was that the film encourages anti-socialist behavior. While admitting that the main characters were definitely not textbook cases and far from perfect, this judgment is clearly ridiculous. However, the relations concerning censorship in the GDR were quite complex. It should not be forgotten that the Defa Studios were paid by the state himself. Every produced film ended in a negotiation between the Studios and the state, which anew had to fence off the limits in the freedom of artistic expression. Sometimes parts were cut out, and some films were banned. Some directors even appreciated the deep interest and involvement of the state officials in their creations. The true message of the film Karla seems to be the demand for professional autonomy, the right to nonconformity and an innovative attitude, in a society that was dominated by planning and central organization. Thirty years later the same demand was portrayed in the film Die Architekten, which however is much gloomier. Actually the GDR did experiment with renewer (&quot;Neuerer&quot;) movements, but they did not really catch on. The economic system relied more on full capacity use (full employment etc.) and reliability than on efficiency improvements and innovation.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Living on Velvet&quot; is a passionate, though slightly incoherent Borzage melodrama starring Kay Francis and George Brent. I&apos;m a fan of director Borzage and the always wavishing Kay Fwancis (she had trouble pronouncing the Rs), so I was very eager to see this one. I happened to watch &quot;Living on Velvet&quot; the other night together with another Borzage love story with Francis &amp; Brent called &quot;Stranded&quot;, also made in 1935 for Warner Brothers. Of the two films, &quot;Living on Velvet&quot; is the best and most uncompromising illustration of Borzage&apos;s lifelong preoccupation with spirituality and humanity. Francis is wonderful in the role of Amy Prentiss, the passionate, devoted wife of Terry Parker (Brent), a rather reckless pilot who miraculously survived a plane crash with his family. The most romantic &amp; unforgettable moment is of course the scene in which Terry meets Amy, seriously looking each other for the first time, their charging eyes never even blinking. The scene is one of Borzage&apos;s greatest achievements. It illustrates his genuine commitment to his material; the couple is looking at love itself, something concrete and tangible. Our involvement and identification are heightened through the emotional intensity of the couple&apos;s passion. The capable supporting players include Warren William as Gibraltar, Terry&apos;s best friend, and Helen Lowell as Aunt Martha."

Yes, the plot is saturated with cliches: high school jock trying to fullfil a dream while winning the heart of a woman. It&apos;s so 80s! I needed a movie to psyche myself up and I was so inspired that it made me sweat in a rubber suit and starved myself till I dropped\n\n(thankfully, I don&apos;t do that anymore). Bottom line is, this film is all about glory-and everbody dreams about glorifying themselves-and Louden Swain is no different. I also like to mention that this film has one of the best movie soundtrack\n\ncompilations ever (better than Rocky, and who wants to listen to Survivor over and over again)."

      "reviewBody": "...do see this movie! I am not a fan of several of the musical genres covered in this film but nonetheless found myself writing down album and performer names during the film to buy later.\n\nIts format of interviews interspersed with concert tapes or filmed performances cuts a wide swath across the Icelandic music scene. Folk, Norse, Punk, Rock and Rap are all covered.\n\nThe musical heritage is described as a &quot;combination of patriotism and adolescence&quot;, the result of living half-way between Europe and the United States and being descended from Vikings who stopped in Scotland for slaves and for Irish women &quot;for DNA enrichment and poetry&quot;.\n\nIt&apos;s hard not to like a movie that includes the Foo Fighters calling upon a garage band from a town of 400 to open for them and hard not to like a country that has an official &quot;Head Pagan&quot;.\n\nA last note: &quot;Odin&apos;s Raven Magic&quot;, based on a 900-year-old excerpt of the Edda was a major highlight for me, performed by Sigur Ros, Hilmar Orn Hilmarssen, the London Sinfonietta and a pair of xylophones made of great big hunks of sandstone! Just like in Hustle and Flow, it&apos;s hard not to leave the theater singing!",

It is also know as the &quot;Devil Made Me Do It&quot; case, which is the first known court case in the United States in which the defense sought to prove innocence based upon the claim of demonic possession and denial of personal responsibility for the crime.\n\nGreat casting in the film.

Demon wind can be watched in one of the respawnable locations and one of them happens to be a cinema. It has 3 watchers already in it and who provide a 90 min long, non stop, commentary\n\nGo and play the game and go and watch the movie🙂",

      "reviewBody": "Well, my friends, I have just returned from the earliest possible showing of &quot;Brothers Grimm&quot; in my area, and I can assure you it was well worth getting up a few hours earlier than usual to watch. However, I would caution anyone who doesn&apos;t like Terry Gilliam&apos;s work, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, or the REAL brothers Grimms&apos; stories that this is not your average fantasy. The story is set in french-occupied Germany in the 1700s, a real time in which real people actually lived. Even some of the magical aspects of the story are explained by real events (I won&apos;t spoil it for you). So quite a bit of the plot deals with the realities of the day and age along with the fantastical aspects of the forest and its inhabitants.\n\nThat being said, the story also deals with the opposite side of unreality-- the dark and unnaturally gruesome. This is where I think the writer hit on a brilliant point; while the real brothers&apos; stories have happy endings and some lighthearted moments, most if not all of their stories involve some degree of blood and gore. My hat is off to Ehren Kruger for being true to that aspect of their work.\n\nThe only aspects of this movie I disliked were the unresolved ending (which I won&apos;t spoil, either) and some of the acting. Lena Headey&apos;s performance did not impress me, but it could just be lack of material to work with (a very overdone character) and the fact that I&apos;ve never seen any of her other work. Matt Damon is interesting to watch as usual. Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce are wacky to the point of annoyance as an Italian torture specialist and a French general. The only truly wonderful performance, however, is that of Mr. Ledger, whose bumbling, scholarly, tag-along Jacob was both a sympathetic character and a side we rarely see from this multi-talented actor.\n\nThis is not a movie for everyone (I wouldn&apos;t bring children with the tendency for nightmares or irrational fears, for example). It&apos;s not a movie you&apos;ll learn from or probably want to see hundreds of times. But for the moviegoer looking for beautiful cinematography, a few good laughs, and a fairly suspenseful story, look no further.",

      "reviewBody": "Disclosure is directed by Barry Levinson and co-adapted to screenplay by Paul Attanasio and Michael Crichton from Crichton&apos;s own novel of the same name. It stars Michael Douglas, Demi Moore, Donald Sutherland, Roma Maffia, Dylan Baker, Caroline Goodall and Rosemary Forsyth. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone.\n\nTom Sanders (Douglas) is an executive at DigiCom, a high-tech computer company, who hopes that now it&apos;s finally his time to get promotion. Passed over for an outsider, he&apos;s further irked when it turns out to be Meredith Johnson (Moore), an old passionate flame of his from years previously. When Meredith arranges for a meeting between the two later that evening, Tom finds himself sexually harassed by her. Spurning her aggressive overtures, Tom is shocked to learn the next day that she has filed a charge of sexual harassment against him. He naturally counters the charge, but this opens up a can of worms for both him and the future of DigiCom.\n\nThe 1990s practically belonged to Michael Crichton, it seemed for a time that everything he wrote was adapted to the big screen for some form of entertainment. With Jurassic Park still warm and still garnering bucket loads of cash, two other Crichton adaptations worked their way into theatres; both of which were a world away from the family friendly extravaganza of Jurassic Park. One was Rising Sun, a messy wasted potential of a movie, the other was Disclosure, a zeitgeist snatcher that seized the moment. \n\nThe topic, and the novelty of flipping the gender aggressor, was always going to make Disclosure of much interest, thus the film and the novel made big money: aided still further by the hot casting of Douglas and Moore, who were still draw cards in the early 90s. Crichton, after being displeased with other adaptations of his work, got big say on the screenplay as a written project. So with director Levinson in tow, he set about pushing the buttons of his audience, attempting to continue the heated debates that were brought about previously from Douglas&apos; Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. If it&apos;s Crichton&apos;s or Levinson&apos;s fault that it didn&apos;t work out that way? I&apos;m not sure, but fact is, is that Disclosure really wasn&apos;t that potent back then, and certainly now it&apos;s not even lukewarm.\n\nThere&apos;s too much techno babble going on, and an over keenness to stick the nose up at the big business vultures picking the flesh off of the lesser minions. Entering the last half hour of the film, it&apos;s easy to forget there has actually been a sexual harassment case! Here&apos;s the crux of the matter, if going in to it for a first time viewing expecting this to be a powder-keg of sexual harassment muckiness and legal intrigue, then you are in for a big disappointment. I know, because I was one of the paying patrons at the theatre back in 94! You sense that one of the makers got a bit carried away\n\nYet the film still has much going for it if stripped of that expectation, not least that it packs a pile of tension in that last half hour and the finale is rather rewarding. I&apos;d go as far to say I&apos;m a fan of the film, but it&apos;s not the film I originally went to see! There&apos;s a trio of interesting and differing female characters at the front of the narrative, even if Moore&apos;s stair-master vixen isn&apos;t exactly developed beyond being a bitch, and the virtual reality sequences have an appealing charm about them. The cast are turning in good ones, with a notable shout out to Caroline Goodall who wisely underplays it as the wife. While the interior set design (Gary Lewis/Joseph Hodges) for the DigiCom HQ is wonderful with its 90s excess of glass meeting mirrors and open spaces. Which leaves us with what?\n\nA film that is not what you expect! Which in this case is both disappointing and a surprise. 7/10",

It&apos;s the Ingmar-Bergman type of film, like Interiors`, much more serious and thoughtful than all of Woody Allen&apos;s other movies, not at all typical for him. In my opinion, it&apos;s even more vivid than Interiors` because there are less people involved and  something that happens less and less in Woody Allen&apos;s movies  there is only one main character. This time, it&apos;s the character herself who tells the story which is really unusual for Allen. \n\nBy leaving every other trade mark in plot and topics away, Allen concentrates on the intellectual dialogues and the analyses people make about each other. It&apos;s characteristic that Marion Post is a professor for philosophy. She automatically analyzes everybody around her, which leads to the fact that they start analyzing her. Her crisis begins, when she learns that people talk about her  which, of course, is something completely natural  and therefore starts analyzing herself. Her character really impressed me because I know people myself who are exactly like Marion Post. Woody Allen is a brilliant psychologist who watches people precisely and that&apos;s why he is able to create such believable characters.",

      "reviewBody": "Alpha Dog is based on the true story of the kidnapping and murder of 15-year-old Nicholas Markowitz and related events in 2000. The story revolves around a drug deal gone awry. Jake Mazursky(Ben Foster) didn&apos;t pay Johny Truelove(Emile Hirsch) the money he was suppose to. Infuriated, Johny, with the help of his friends, kidnaps Jake Mazursky&apos;s brother, 15 year old Zack Mazursky(Anton Yelchin) as some sort of ransom to force Jake to pay him. Johnny&apos;s friends eventually become attached to the kid and the boy is actually having the time of his life but in the end something terrible happens... Be aware that Alpha Dog is raw and gritty, after all the film portrays, in part at least, the world of drug dealing, but one can argue that it portrays, as well, how an entire generation in America is in disgrace, some chose to be delinquents but for others, this is all they&apos;ve known their entire lives and their parents exhibit the same kind of behavior. Cassavetes did a great job telling this story and the cast was exceptional. Ben Foster is truly amazing as the crazy and deranged drug addict Jake Mazursky and Anton Yelchin was perfect as Jake&apos;s naive little brother and god damn it, even Justin Timberlake delivered! Towards the end of the movie he plays an emotional scene so well that you can&apos;t help but wonder if he didn&apos;t chose the wrong career. Emile Hirsch wasn&apos;t bad but was definitely out shined by the rest of the cast. The supporting cast is composed by such actors as Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, Amber Heard and Olivia Wilde. Overall, Alpha Dog is a well directed and extremely well acted movie that seems to depict in a very truthful way a very unfortunate event. Definitely a good watch! \n\n7.5/10"

      "reviewBody": "Wow! I honestly can&apos;t believe that I&apos;d never heard of this excellent little eighties horror film! How The Rejuvenator has managed to stay undiscovered all these years is anyone&apos;s guess, as this entertaining mix of splatter and Sunset Blvd does what it says on the tin, and then some! Science and the human body give way to all kinds of horrific horror scenarios - from the constant attempts to rebuild a face in the French classic Eyes Without a Face, to the teleporting disasters in The Fly, you can usually count on an intriguing, and frightening, film if it&apos;s based on something scientific. The plot here focuses on actress Elizabeth Warren; she&apos;s now too old for the good roles, and like most women, wants to recapture her youth. Unlike most women, however, she&apos;s prepared to go that extra mile to realise her dream, and she employs Dr. Gregory Ashton to make her young again. He discovers something in the brain that affects the aging process, and soon performs his experiment on her. But it has unforeseen side effects, and pretty soon Elizabeth begins regenerating into a hideous brain eating monster!\n\nGiven that it&apos;s an eighties horror film, you&apos;ve got to expect rather a lot of silliness and tacky special effects, which the film has in droves; but it has to be said that the plot is carried off really well, and despite being cheap and nasty, the special effects fit the film and are a hell of a lot more believable than the CGI that would infect The Rejuvenator if it were made nowadays. The characters aren&apos;t exactly well defined, but a film like this needs the audience to care at least somewhat for them otherwise the story won&apos;t hold any weight, and director Brian Thomas Jones obviously knows that as he ensures that the situation feels as real as possible. The acting isn&apos;t bad, and sees Vivian Lanko doing well in the double central role, and while John MacKay doesn&apos;t exactly convince as a genius doctor - he&apos;s at least fun to watch, and the two have some chemistry together. The film is interesting throughout, and while there&apos;s no out and out standout moments, there&apos;s enough going on for it to remain interesting. Overall, The Rejuvenator might not appeal to everyone, but if you like your eighties horror cheesy and imaginative - I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;ll enjoy this!",

Woody Harrelson also gives what i reckon is one of his best ever performances. he seems to be able to use his character as a doctor to his full advantage, and yet show an understanding side to blue. I really would recommend anybody to watch this film, because it is such an eye opener.",

Some of the special effects are, however, a bit hokey.\n\nIt is not clear in the movie that Saladin was a Kurd rather than an an Arab. Instead he is presented as a hero for calling for Arab unity in the face of western colonialist intrusion.\n\nIn this respect director Chahine makes Saladin a prototype of Gamel Abdul Nasser in calling for Arab unity in order to expel the western intruders."

So he decides to buy a 1000 foot pier and run it as a ship. The city-council though has other plans with de seafront and the pier does not really fit into their plans.  The Captain can only do one thing: declare his pier as a proper cruise ship! This is a film that fits in with the other small masterpieces made by Ealing Studios in the fifties and I can really recommend it..",

      "reviewBody": "As has been said before, German citizens don&apos;t always think too much of German comedy films. Too often these are VERY obvious, blatant, superficial etc. - you name it. Seems we have a different culture here, if you compare to films like Dumb and Dumber, Jay and Silent Bob, Jim Carey stuff etc. you will find that in Germany this kind of film is more or less restricted to the age 12 to 16 where you will want to laugh and not think about plot lines, stringency of characters and story etc. So, let&apos;s leave aside a number of flaws in the plot and some not very credible twists. Sitting in the cinema, this film actually makes you roll of your chair a couple of times and has some really good gags - most of them drawing on ridiculous situations and confrontations. Although handicapped persons play quite a role (sometimes wondered, which were actors and which actually handicapped ..) they are neither being made fun of, nor exploited. Rather, some concern for their situation is raised. The thing that saves this film is the actors. Alexandra Maria Lara is more beautiful than ever and will make male viewers shrink in their seats in awe. Christoph Maria Herbst (Maria btw. can be a male or female second name in German) offers a wild and extremely convincing role as a wheelchair-confined basket ball fan (stay on for the snippet that comes up after the first credits at the end of the film!). Including one of the best dialogues I have seen acted in a long time: Herbst, having hurt himself badly is pensively picking a glass splinter from his shoulder when Denise asks &apos;are you hurt?&apos; and he replies matter-of-factedly &apos;how come you ask?&apos; not even looking at her. Till Schweiger has been bashed quite a bit in Germany - which seems &apos;normal&apos; with any actor having too much success. Jealousy, I&apos;d say. It can be said, that he is not too much of a character actor and mostly &apos;sells&apos; his good looks. In this film he actually does offer a fair performance. Playing the grumbly guy with a bad conscience fits him well. I&apos;ve never heard of neither the director nor the script author, but maybe we will be seeing some new quality work in German cinema soon?",

      "reviewBody": "Although perhaps not widely considered as one of Wadja&apos;s better films, it would be superb if it were the work of a lesser director.  Aside from being interesting and unique look into the world behind the camera, this film is so much more.  The personal nature of the film shines through and one cannot help but respect the thoughtful way in which Wadja created this homage to Zbigniew Cybulski.  There are so many wonderful nuances in this film that it is difficult to relate or even absorb them all.  One of the most prominent themes in the film that stood out was the blending of reality and fiction. Wadja seems to develop this theme throughout the film in relation to developing the characters and the reality in which they live. However, that&apos;s just my opinion and it&apos;s quite possible that I am grossly misinterpreting that aspect of the film.  But that said, it&apos;s an amazing film and if you like Wadja&apos;s other work, it&apos;s a very slim possibility that you will not like this one.  Unfortunately it&apos;s difficult to get a hold of, but if you have the opportunity to get it, I would recommend (for whatever that&apos;s worth) that you not pass it up.",

      "reviewBody": "This third version of THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE made in 1935 is pretty much faithful to the 1913 and 1926 versions except for some character and plot changes. The original story&apos;s premise is simple: A poor student (circa 1800&apos;s) named Balduin loves an aristocratic woman named Magrit but she&apos;s betrothed to Baron Waldis. Balduin signs a pact with Scapinelli who&apos;s interpreted to be the Devil in disguise by offering him 100,000 gold coins to woo the countess in exchange for anything in his room. Since Balduin as nothing of value, he figures what the hell and accepts the pact. Well that&apos;s what breaks loose when the stranger releases his reflection from a mirror and it&apos;s not too soon before the student&apos;s evil double makes his life a living hell by ruining his plans. The 1913 version starred Paul Wegener (1874-1948), best known for his GOLEM films, and you can watch a restored, tinted print on YouTube. The second version made in 1926 starred Conrad Veidt (1893-1943) as Balduin and Werner Krauss (1884-1959) as Scapinelli who has more to do here since Krauss became an important character actor since 1920&apos;s THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. This time Balduin is offered 600,000 florins, probably due to post-WW! inflation. This version has better production values and Veidt is shown more tormented by his mistake as only Veidt could do. Unfortunately there&apos;s only a terrible print shown on YouTube but you get the idea how good it would look given a proper restoration. \n\nThe 1935 version casts Adolf Wohlbruck (1896-1967), who was soon to become Anton Walbrook after he left Germany before his homosexuality and being half Jewish became a problem with the Nazis, as Balduin who&apos;s also a noted fencer as in previous versions. The character of the countess Margit is replaced with an opera singer named Julia played by Dorothea Wieck (1908-1986) best known as the teacher in 1931&apos;s MADCHEN IN UNIFORM. Her singing is dubbed by the opera singer Miliza Korjus (1909- 1980). Scapinelli becomes Dr. Carpis played by Theodor Loos (1883-1954), another well-known character actor who seems to be channeling Krauss. It&apos;s possible the villain Scapinelli&apos;s name was changed to Carpis because Germany didn&apos;t want to offend their fellow- Fascist friend Mussolini and his country. Carpis has more to do here than Scapinelli in earlier versions as he&apos;s now Julia&apos;s former lover who&apos;s jealous of the rich Baron, seen more as a fop here, and of Balduin&apos;s attention. When he shows up unexpectedly in her room and she asks where he came from, he answers with: &quot;Where you are not... is Hell for me&quot; making his character more figuratively a devil than literally as in the previous versions; later Balduin will call Carpis a &quot;devil&quot; in anger. \n\nCarpis uses the Baron and Balduin to hurt Julia but this time there&apos;s no written contract with money and instead Balduin is given the power to make money by gambling. Instead of releasing Balduin&apos;s reflection, he imprisons Baldwin&apos;s good side, the &quot;sentimental dreamer&quot; inside the mirror by cloaking it to allow Balduin&apos;s bad side to take over. As in the earlier versions. both sides come face- to-face using camera tricks as his good side that escaped from the mirror silently pursues him to incense his actions while making him feel guilty with increasing madness. As in previous versions, when a duel prearranged to spare the Baron&apos;s life (not shown in other versions but only its aftermath) goes wrong, he&apos;s shunned by everyone. Balduin eventually realizes the extent of what he&apos;s become, and finally confronts his reflection in the mirror to free himself. Their final meeting is the film&apos;s highlight and one of Wohlbruck&apos;s best performances, and on a par with Veidt&apos;s baroque one. \n\nTHE STUDENT OF PRAGUE was the last film directed by Arthur Robison (1883-1935) who also directed 1923&apos;s Expressionistic classic WARNING SHADOWS that used no subtitles and let the story unfold through stunning imagery. There&apos;s some of that photography by Bruno Mondi (1903-1991) in STUDENT but not a lot because the Nazis mostly frowned on anything connected to the Weimar era when Mondi shot Fritz Lang&apos;s DESTINY (1921) also known as DER MUDE TOD and also 11 of Veit Harlan&apos;s films after STUDENT. Theo Mackeben&apos;s suspenseful Hollywood-style score gives the right menacing mood when needed; Mackeben ((1897-1953) was a versatile composer who also wrote operas. It&apos;s difficult to find contemporary reviews in English except for a mixed but mostly negative one from Graham Greene (1904-1991) who thought the film&apos;s allegory was &quot;on the right side of imagination in an unimaginative industry&quot; and praised Robison&apos;s trademark touches, &quot;his slow decorative methods, the curious ballet-like quality he procured by the constant panning of his camera. But dull the film undoubtedly is: a curiosity, a relic of the classical German film of silent days.... The acting doesn&apos;t help&quot; and he preferred Veidt&apos;s version. I heartily disagree about this STUDENT being dull and the acting not aiding the story, If you liked the previous versions, you should watch this one especially if you&apos;re a fan of Wohlbruck/Walbrook.\n\nThe story, photography, and Wohlbruck&apos;s performance will remind you of the 1949 English fantasy-horror film THE QUEEN OF SPADES where he plays a poor Russian soldier who sells his soul for financial gain and it&apos;s more than likely its director Thorold Dickenson remembered this STUDENT when he cast and made his film. For a Nazi-era film, STUDENT is free of propaganda and you can get a good copy with subtitles at: rarefilmsandmore.com",

Tests prove that the unmarried young woman has &quot;one in the oven&quot; so to speak and never one to pry or judge, Monica helps to secure her a place in a country clinic to see out her pregnancy away from the frowning eyes of her townsfolk.\n\nThe two share a mutual friend in Anna Littlefield (Verree Teasdale) who is the first to find out that the elusive father of the unborn child is none other than the husband of the blissfully unaware Dr Monica!\n\nJohn is away on business and also has no clue as to the results of his adultery when Mary goes into labour.\n\nAlready finding her imminent baby delivering duties painful in light of a recent very negative phone call from a fertility specialist, Monica is suddenly plunged into personal, emotional and moral turmoil when she overhears a phone call revealing that her husband is the sire of the soon to be born illegitimate child.\n\nDecisions decisions decisions!!\n\nA very well acted drama by all involved. Kay Francis is the picture of class and elegance and the brilliant Warren William manages once again to be very likeable despite playing a scoundrel. It&apos;s also interesting to see him in one of only two films (the other being as Julius Caesar in his previous film, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;) in which he doesn&apos;t sport his trademark moustache.",

They were wrong and inaccurate.  For example, the Mass vestments were not correct.  The conversations and characterizations of the pastor and the young priest, for that period of time (Boston in the late 30s, early 40s) were off key, to say the least. The plot was interesting, but the film was too long, and there was too much &quot;symbolism&quot;, and the &quot;next move&quot; was always predictable.  With such a fine cast, and a great story, the producers and the directors should have taken time to be more accurate and correct about details.  Another example of the lack of care was the scene where the young priest is seen administering &quot;Anointing of the Sick&quot; [formerly called &quot;Extreme Unction&quot;] to a corpse about to be buried.  This never happens and is actually forbidden in the RC Church.  Dead people cannot receive &quot;sacraments.&quot; Attention must be paid.  Details, details, details. The truth is in the details.  However, I did enjoy it. I think most people would find this film interesting and entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "Two gnarled statues of grotesque beasts make love in the garden, a perverse cuckoo clock exposes female bodily organs, a skeletal figure shot through with arrows twists its face in a silent wail towards heaven. This is the decor of &quot;The Scarlet Empress,&quot; furnishings which speak more of the film&apos;s themes and ideas than the plot could ever be allowed to. The actors remain intentionally wooden; it&apos;s as if the world around them was an expression of their suppressed emotions. Shame takes the guise of chairs, but chairs in the shape of gargantuan, deformed old men hiding their stricken faces in hideous fingers. Masochism is occasionally a clock, lust a decorative food display, but all perverse, leering. And death... Everywhere is a ghastly preoccupation with death, icons proudly display decapitation, skeletons stretch themselves over boiling cauldrons, while ghastly statues of tortured corpses lurk in every shadowy corner. Together this creates a world of painful decadence, a disgusting, yet fascinating dreamscape of visual pleasure.\n\nAll this takes form and depth, is sculpted by director Sternberg&apos;s haunting lighting. It is &quot;his&quot; light, he lords over it, and with it anything is possible. He can make a face beautiful or ugly, innocent or evil. He can accentuate a certain side of a person&apos;s nature, or how a specific set piece relates to it, all with the proper illumination.\n\nIf his lighting is astounding, equally so is Sternberg&apos;s use of the visual motifs in his mise en scene (bells, veils, figures, specific set pieces, etc...) to transport the viewer back and forth through the film. For instance, the binding of Catherine and Peter&apos;s hands at their marriage is later echoed by an unquestionably similar knot Catherine ties in a napkin she is fondling, and then tosses onto the table of she and Peter&apos;s last meal together. The initiation of their marriage and the initiation of its end are in this way linked, and the audience is forced to take into account the changes in both their characters. Not only does the rhythm of these motifs remain figurative. The movement of the film takes on a distinct rhythm as well. A swinging motif is evident throughout, the bells, the incense burners, Catherine&apos;s swing, the hoopskirts, a baby&apos;s basket, and so on. In this the film takes the feel of a frenzied, but excellently choreographed dance. \n\nBut in all this there is one thing more noteworthy. Marlene Dietrich radiates! Quite possibly the most beautiful woman who ever lived, she begins innocent and virginal (seemingly intentionally melodramatically), standing out in a world of amorality. She is both the happiest and saddest point of the film. Her wedding to the vulgar Peter in an immense, yet claustrophobic cathedral is the most emotional part of the film. As it is filmed entirely in a series of close-ups of individuals, and long shots that blur their faces, there is no discernible eye connection between any of the characters. She is completely alone. As a voyeuristic camera cuts closer and closer to her trembling, veiled face, we suddenly feel the need to turn away. We know now that this last thread of decency is about to be crippled. Soon enough her innocence begins to fade before her sexuality, and the surroundings that once nearly suppressed her, she lords over, a queen of immorality.\n\n &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; expresses the essence of film, and why it succeeds as an art form. It creates the possibility of a world almost wholly artificial, divorced from anything that ever was. It retains only fragmentary reproductions of something that existed in a pre-filmed state, combining and distorting them to effect something 90% fake. What&apos;s more that seems all it is interested in. No other artistic medium (aside from painting) is viewed worthy of its visuals, and all theatrical, literary, or other requirements are given little attention. They are flippantly thrown in only to please a narrow minded audience, and occasionally (but very, very rarely) to accentuate the films themes. Yet painting, ah yes, painting. That was a medium worthy of a brilliant visionary like Sternberg, and one he transferred to the screen with gusto. &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; is to Dali in its obsession with the bizarre, da Vinci in its detail, Picasso in its complexity of associations, but entirely Sternberg in its conception."

This movie shows war as it is; mindless decisions of those who started it, poor people struggling to survive and find better future, orphans problems, war criminal etc., and how it affects on society (family!) and individuals (suicides). Mustafa Nadarevic did a great role in movie, by making enormous efforts (greater than he gave to his own family) to give two orphans chance to survive and at last, better future. Even he haves drinking problems, he can abstain himself not doing wrong decisions and think reasonably. He deserved more prizes for his characteristic style and honest acting.\n\nAlmedin Leleta and his movie brother Almir Podgorica, 10 and 13 years old when movie was first shown, also empathized their orphans roles and shown great talent. Sincerely, I can only recommend you this movie, particularly if you are from war affected country.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand&apos;s Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they&apos;re all stuck in. Clouzot&apos;s directing is flawless - I don&apos;t think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg&apos;s early gem, &quot;The Duel&quot;, but Clouzot&apos;s automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I&apos;ve ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don&apos;t see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.",

Although I thought he was very good in the film the film focused too much on him (i mean 3 songs with the guy who&apos;s only there for 15 minutes?!) It should have concentrated on fleshing out the &apos;Army&apos; more and the three love stories were basically pointless. I feel Mohnish Behl and Sudesh Berry&apos;s characters were more identifiable than the other three and so i was unhappy with the climax. The first song especially and the &apos;Army&apos; song are clearly the only two songs worth remembering. But watched as a whole the movie leaves you feeling good.",

Being a fan of anything SF and post-apocalyptic I already knew I was probably going to like it at least a bit but oh my was I completely mind-blown. Acting, music, atmosphere, story and background stories, the way the plot revolves, the fact that due to the low-budget factor of the movie a lot of it is left cleverly to your own imagination - all top-notch, there is nothing I would change. Interesting story made into brilliant movie.\n\nOf course, take into account my plausible biases and fact that this is indeed low-budget movie and that it should be judged in this light.",

To say that the second film &quot;The Great King&quot; does everything better is a statement that I just can&apos;t agree with.\n\nThe actor playing Frederick is &apos;worth the price of admission&apos;. Excellent job in both films. There is a big difference in the outlook of the two films. The former is much more optimistic while the latter was forced to be re-edited under Goebell&apos;s and Hitler&apos;s direction. Why? The second film showed the Russians of the time in too good a light. Hitler made sure that was changed, especially in 1942. But that is the second film. This one has some very good scenes with Frederick. What comes to mind is the one where he meets the farmers in the field or comes across a small village destroyed by the Austrians.",

      "name": "Too tight a focus on a familiar subject without the searing questions, bigger picture or soul-searching that it required",
      "reviewBody": "Errol Morris has covered some interesting and weird subjects and I found his last film (Fog of War) to be quite fascinating, so I was looking forward to seeing where he went next. I was quite surprised that he chose to do a documentary on Iraq. Sure, it is totally the subject of our time but it has become a very cluttered subject  not only in documentary films but also the amount of news coverage etc that is available. When I learnt that the film would be a tight focus on Abu Ghraib I hoped that Morris would explore the total human aspect of it and do a really good job of delivering this part of it.\n\nUnfortunately what Morris manages to produce is a film that is solid but not as remarkable as the subject deserves. Part of this, it must be said, is familiarity with the subject; having seen many films that do it better. Taxi to the Dark Side comes to mind specifically because it uses the prison as its starting point before following the smell upwards and outwards to paint a much bigger picture of failure and things that are impacting beyond specific acts of torture. By remaining within the world of the prison, Morris potentially could do enough to standout as being THE film on the subject. The early signs are good because I was surprised to see several of the main names/faces that I knew from the news coverage of the scandal and thus this was going to be the story from those involved firsthand. This was a gamble in a way because the problem with the aftermath of Abu Ghraib was that it was only the &quot;little people&quot; that got the spotlight and nobody else and, by focusing on them, Morris needed to get a lot from them or else his film would end up the same way.\n\nHe does this to a point as they discuss in detail what they did and what they saw and it does still have the power to shock and depress. In some regards the anger described makes the violence a little understandable but what I was shocked by was the sheer banality and boredom-inspired viciousness of it all. It helps this aspect that so many of the contributions are delivered in such matter-of-fact manners that it does jar that they don&apos;t seem shocked by what they are describing. The truth is probably that they aren&apos;t  partly because it was &quot;normal&quot; but also that they have discussed it many times. Everyone is a bit defensive and Morris doesn&apos;t ever manage to draw much emotion from them in the telling  factually the material is engaging but Morris never really gets beyond that. While &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side&quot; moved up the chain of command, Morris needed to move into his interviewees&apos; soul  something he doesn&apos;t manage to do.\n\nThe second failing of the film is the overuse of &quot;recreated&quot; scenes and asides. In Thin Blue Line, it cost him (at very least) an Oscar nomination but here it has a negative impact immediately as you are watching it. With so much shocking reality to discuss and so many real images, some of the recreations are clunky in how out of place they are. I&apos;m not talking about the creative sequences that Morris uses as a bed for dialogue (eg a cellblock full of shredded paper, the letters written back to a partner in the US) but rather the recreations and stuff &quot;around&quot; the pictures. It was unnecessary and distracted from what as real and powerful enough.\n\nThe film still works as a good summary of events within Abu Ghraib but it is hard to get excited about it since so much of it feels familiar. The tight focus itself is not an issue but it is when Morris cannot manage to produce searing questions, a bigger picture or intimate soul-searching it doesn&apos;t ever do anything that makes it standout in a crowded marketplace."

Nonetheless, I&apos;m also a big fan of Wallace, and I&apos;m eternally grateful to him, because his work kickstarted the German Krimi-films, and eventually the Italian giallo-boom.\n\n&quot;The Indian Scarf&quot; is very reminiscent to Christie&apos;s most famous story, namely &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; aka &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;. It&apos;s the same old and traditional plot of greedy family members gathering in a gothic castle for the reading of a will, but then naturally get killed off one by one by someone whirling around scarves. It&apos;s a prototypic, but amusing and reasonably fast-paced Krimi, with familiar faces in the cast (Klaus Kinski, Eddi Arent, ...) and clichéd twists in the script. Whenever one of the characters is suspected by the others of being the killer, the suspect is killed him/herself. You know; - that sort of twists. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen a castle/mansion with SO many secret passageways and hidden doors, though...\n\nOh, and Eddi Arent - as the dry sarcastic butler - has a fully automated breakfast trolley, which results in a handful of subtle but hilarious comic-relief sequences.",

      "reviewBody": "If The Little Hut had been done as originally written by Andre Roussin had been done this might have been a far better film. In the original version the Ava Gardner character actually does have sex with all concerned on the island she&apos;s stranded on. But Hollywood is still in 1957 a prisoner of the Code so that kind of infidelity could never be shown on the big screen. If there is a French language version of The Little Hut I&apos;ll bet it&apos;s far better.\n\nThe French characters are changed to British here and even stranded on a tropical island they all behave quite civilized even in adultery. Stewart Granger and Ava Gardner are married and are on a yachting tour with a party of friends including Granger&apos;s best friend David Niven. The ship goes down and the three of them are stranded on the island where they build two huts, a big one for the married couple and The Little Hut for Niven. \n\nBut with not a whole lot to do on the island they engage in a lot of frank dialog and Niven opens up that he&apos;s been Gardner&apos;s lover for about six years. Granger who does kind of take things for granted with Gardner is affronted, but as captain of the former ship decides that if his powers include marriage they also include divorce. He divorces Gardner and Granger and Niven exchange huts. Later on a really hunky looking native that Gardner looks lasciviously on enters the picture and things really get complicated.\n\nThat lascivious look was not acting on Ava&apos;s part because she was involved with Italian actor Walter Chiari at that time. If the script had called for them to do the deed she would have no doubt been even better.\n\nThe Little Hut with all the sex taken out plays like a combination of The Admirable Crichton, Three&apos;s Company, and Gilligan&apos;s Island. I&apos;m sure Sherwood Schwartz who produced Gilligan&apos;s Island saw how the cast lived on that island, how they showed such ingenuity in creating some creature comforts, that he probably incorporated much of it in his show. It&apos;s the best part of The Little Hut.\n\nThe play on which this was based was a big hit on the West End of London, but when it came to Broadway in 1953 it flopped terribly with only 29 performances. Playing the Granger, Niven, and Gardner roles on Broadway were Roland Culver, Colin Gordon, and Anne Vernon.\n\nIf the film were done 20 years later as originally conceived by Andre Roussin the results would have been better. But the stars especially Niven are three of the most charming folks around and they put it over as best they could.",

Romero of his day, fails to deliver with this one, though.\n\nWe have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free. Also, a love interest for the evil man.\n\nWhere this film really excels is in the imagery. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film (though this has a valid plot reason later on).\n\nI would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk, but this film just did not deliver. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to do battle against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi&apos;s eyes? A nice effect, but misleading as he is never in the film... why not recreate this with the new actor&apos;s eyes? Overall, a film that could be a great one with a little script re-working and could someday be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame). Heck, if they can fix up &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; then this film has hope.",

He leaves his wife, causing her to become neurotic, depending on a clairvoyant to sooth her nerves. Their daughter is trapped in an unhappy marriage, while her husband is dying to prove himself that he is still worthy of something. Given such well developed and convincing backgrounds, &quot;You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger&quot; can only be a great film on character analysis. There is not a moment of boredom, all the characters are attractive and engaging in their own way. In true Woody Allen style, the characters are quirky, yet interesting and adorable. The characters are not as paranoid as in previous films, which is a departure from his usual style. It is still a great effort, and I enjoyed watching it a lot."

      "name": "A very well done film with mostly great performances and intelligent writing, but won&apos;t appeal to everybody",
      "reviewBody": "The Big Knife is not for everybody. Some will find it very literate, well-directed and acted(mostly), handling the tense and satire aspects deftly, while others will find it overdone. Both viewpoints are completely understandable, for me there were parts where the film did fall into the latter camp but most of the time it was the former.\n\nAs an adaptation of the stage play, which is very compelling and thought-provoking, it is very faithful and translates well adaptation-wise. As a film, it&apos;s far from perfect but it comes over well as a film.\n\nThere are a few things that don&apos;t come off quite as successfully as the rest of the film. Rod Steiger has a very ruthless character, but for my tastes Steiger plays the role too broadly to the point that Hoff felt more of a cartoonish caricature than a real person, to the extent that it came close to hurting the balance of the film and he didn&apos;t come over as very threatening. In his performance, there is a lot of camp and scenery-chewing, but not enough of the menace that the role so ruthlessly written needs. The ending does dissolve into contrived melodrama, which is where it is most understandable as to why some will find the film overdone, and felt rushed as well. Lastly, the film does feel over-scored in places, in the places where there is music the blaring music cues felt intrusive.\n\nWith the exception of Steiger, the performances are very good. Jack Palance&apos;s powerhouse lead performance is one of his best, while Ida Lupino is heart-wrenching and dignified. Wendall Corey wisely underplays and is very entertaining, and Everett Sloane, Jean Hagen(chilling in a role so different to hers in Singin&apos; In the Rain) and a memorable Shelley Winters(in a performance that hits hard) do equally pleasingly. The script is remarkably literate and intelligent, with the tension being portrayed quite realistically and the satire being boldly lacerating. The story moves deliberately, but the tension present is enough to haunt the mind and the subject matter is a bold one and told in a biting, sometimes fun and poignant way. The Big Knife is photographed with class and atmosphere, the production values are appropriately claustrophobic and Robert Aldrich&apos;s direction is more than able, often excellent.\n\nOverall, a very acquired taste, but for this viewer while not without flaws it was a well done film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "With sex and death, the two staples of literature, hulking mostly in the background, Caos Calmo deals mainly with parenting, by a single father no less, and the ties that connect concerned parents and their children. The result is a nuanced, always interesting film about human interactions in the semi-sane modern world. I mean it as a compliment when I say it is the sort of movie Jane Austen might have scripted had she survived to the ripe old age of 233. The film happens to be set in present-day Italy so there is a bit of local color for Italophiles, but it could have been set in any modern Western nation. Pietro, a successful businessman, confronts the sudden death of his wife as he seeks to ease the transition for his now motherless ten-year-old daughter. Apparently to show her he is fully there for her, he abandons his office and waits for his daughter in the piazza outside her school each school day. Tutto il mondo comes to that piazza -- gossiping mothers, a developmentally challenged boy, Pietro&apos;s hot sister-in-law on the verge of a nervous breakdown, his secretary with papers to sign, his colleagues from the office stewing over the progress of merger negotiations and what it means to them, a young beauty with a big dog who needs a hug (the beauty, I mean), even Roman Polanski in a cameo appearance. Over the course of the picture Pietro convincingly works through his feelings about marriage, loss, grief, friendship, family, and desire. The emotional center of Caos Calmo is like a toned down, more serious sitcom, like Seinfeld on downers. As in life, there are small mysteries unsolved, but no scene -- surely not the much-discussed nighttime scene that serves to affirm life -- is out of place. The film works. Enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 1950s, nuclear attack by the Soviet Union was on every American&apos;s mind. Shorts like this might seem ridiculous in hindsight now that the Cold War is a thing of the past, but things like this are still important today, as the Earth is still home to thousands of nuclear weapons. This short attempts to prove to the US public that cleaning the inside of your house (and the area around it) might not only save your home in case of atomic war, but your life as well. The film shows a vast and empty test range in the Nevada desert which is where many nuclear tests are carried out. On the range are two houses. Both are made of wood, but one has a tidy interior while the other house is the opposite. A nuke explodes some miles away, and within seconds, a huge shockwave destroys parts of both roofs, but the left house is still standing. The one on the right burns to a crisp. Next, we see three houses. The one on the right is composed mostly of old wood that&apos;s never been painted before, and has a large amount of garbage and clutter around the outside. The house on the left is much of the same, and is built of old, rotten wood that&apos;s practically falling apart. Finally, the middle house is painted pure white to reflect the intense flash of an atomic explosion, has no clutter in its vicinity, and has been recently painted, which helps alleviate moisture. The excruciating heat generated by the bomb is noticeably less effective at damaging this house, and it&apos;s shown to be remarkably intact after the other two go up in flames. Ironically, the house on the right starts burning because a fire ignited on the garbage and then spread to the house. We&apos;re then told how important it is to keep the inside and outside of your house clean because it can save you from the end of the world. In general, I thought this short was pretty ridiculous, which seems to be the general consensus among the 50 or so people who took time out of their day to watch it. In reality, following the nonsense guidelines shown in this short wouldn&apos;t actually mean anything in case a nuke explodes in your city, as anyone relatively close to ground zero would be disintegrated and people for miles around would suffer intense burns and exposure to cancerous radiation. Back then, I suppose films like this had to be made to reassure the population, even if the notion of surviving such a huge explosion is absurd. At the very least, the short encourages you to make sure you don&apos;t leave things lying around your house.",

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t think, just watch. Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes once again are, after &apos;White Men Can&apos;t Jump&apos;, a pretty funny team. Don&apos;t care for the plot, just see these two actors having a lot of fun with their characters and the situations they find themselves in.\n\nHere they play two brothers, sort of. They are both cops, operating in and around a metro station. A criminal nick-named Torch (Chris Cooper), you can imagine what his crime is, is the villain they are trying to catch. There are also problems with Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), the man who controls the tracks. He puts his &quot;money train&quot; above everything, so when Charlie (Harrelson) and John (Snipes) delay that train with their police work, he gets mad. Another thing about money: Charlie is a bad gambler and owns a man named Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a lot of it. Jennifer Lopez, she plays Officer Grace Santiago, is the love interest for one of the two leads, of course leading to friction between them.\n\nThe film is called &apos;Money Train&apos; so you understand the main story has to do with that train. I liked that story. The other stories seem to be there for Harrelson or Snipes and the fun they can have with them. The Lopez-character is necessary to explain certain actions that follow, the Cooper-character provides the film with some extra action-sequences. I didn&apos;t mind those things. They make sure the film delivers what it promises us. Action and comedy. Every scene between Snipes and Harrelson makes you smile. As a team they come close to Owen Wilson with anybody (Ben Stiller, Jackie Chan). If you don&apos;t expect too much there is a very good chance you will enjoy &apos;Money Train&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Just the mention of playing role of Othello makes Ronald Coleman&apos;s Anthony John start hallucinating.  Triggered by this project suggestion, Anthony finds himself murmuring lines from Shakespeare&apos;s tragedy while walking down the street alone and sitting by himself in restaurants.\n\nAnthony&apos;s total commitment to his craft of fantasy, unfortunately, takes a deadly toll on his private life.  Signe Hasso&apos;s Brita understands this, and instantly fears for her ex-husband&apos;s--now co-star&apos;s--happiness.\n\nHere&apos;s a modern tragedy, scripted by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, of an actor who just couldn&apos;t leave his role at the stage door.\n\n &quot;When the actor starts believing he&apos;s the character he&apos;s playing, that&apos;s the time to fire him,&quot; remains a wise theatre management adage.\n\n It&apos;s a darned good principle, too.\n\nWhen the actor fails to maintain an &quot;invisible wall&quot; between himself and his co-actors, that&apos;s the time for some concern.  Although practioners of the Stanislavsky tradition may achieve great &quot;truth&quot; in their work, they may not realize that this achievement is more &quot;relative&quot; than &quot;absolute&quot; and can become a &quot;double edged-sword.&quot;\n\nAnthony John&apos;s &quot;character-absorption&quot; tendency, while earning him a &quot;great performance,&quot; conversely yields a decidedly unconstructive home life. Unless the actor finds some kernels of project idealism to enhance his personal development, the entire enterprise may be negligible. \n\n Milton Krasner&apos;s dark cinematography and Miklos Rozsa&apos;s dissonant score supports George Cukor&apos;s pessimistic direction.  Likewise, Walter Hampden&apos;s advisement for the &quot;Othello&quot; sequences adds authenticity to the Shakespearian flavor.  \n\nIn the end, we have a shattering drama, holding within its fold a grave thespian caution: &quot;it&apos;s only a character being played, not real life.&quot;\n\n For his fine work as Anthony John, Coleman received an Academy Award."

This is the first time I am actually seeing an Etaix movie (via the Criterion&apos;s DVD). and I see the charm, but I also see the limitations of Etaix&apos;s art, unfortunately. While Jacques Tati&apos;s &quot;Playtime&quot; is a timeless masterpiece ( I have seen Playtime 3 or 4 times now, big screen or small screen, and I never get tired of it) Pierre Etaix&apos; s &quot;Yoyo&quot; has its charming moments and delightful camera angles, but in the end, it comes out as a collection of gags (some enchanting, some dated) with no coherence behind them. No developed storyline. &quot;Yoyo&quot; starts in a virtuoso way (fabulous fake silent movie!), but peters out quickly script wise, and by the end, elicits only a &quot;meh?&quot;. I stopped watching the second movie (&quot;As long as you got your health&quot;) after 2 &quot;sketches&quot;: no plot, bad timing, irritating musical choices. I am so very sorry, Mr Etaix.",

      "reviewBody": "In his autobiography, The Name&apos;s Above the Title, Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters, the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.\n\nWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined. Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself, especially with that system all her own. But in doing what he did for Clark Gable&apos;s character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold.\n\nCapra&apos;s autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it. \n\nCapra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn&apos;t have been more cooperative.\n\nAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.\n\nThe rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.\n\nThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They&apos;re together for most of the film so if it doesn&apos;t click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in. \n\nGable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can&apos;t get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It&apos;s also a great film, but it&apos;s not a classic like It Happened One Night.",

However, I have seen WICKED GHOST III: THE POSSESSION, and I can declare it to be a totally cheap and generic Hong Kong ghost story, shot on video with the minimum of fuss and minimum of ideas. There&apos;s some self-referencing involved as the story is set on and around a film set where a cast and crew are shooting a gory horror film. Unfortunately for them, one of the actresses finds herself cursed by the spirit of an unhappy ghost, and all manner of supernatural events are soon affecting the director and his crew.\n\nThis is a cheap and cheerful film, with a lot of nonsense humour thrown in to make it an enjoyable experience. It isn&apos;t; films like this don&apos;t tend to travel well across the world, and even somebody who considers himself a huge fan of Asian horror cinema struggled with it. The performances are poor and the effects are even worse, so most of the time I was laughing at it. The film does have a number of attractive young actresses in it, though, most of whom run around in skimpy attire, so if that&apos;s your bag you may find more to like here.",

Unfortunately this takes away from the enjoyment of one of the classic benchmark scifi films of the fifties. I have a VHS tape of the film that has a better print. This DVD is also usually priced higher than other DVDs or prints. It is definitely not worth it. Try other versions before you buy this one."

How do their theatre collaborators stop them going there?\n\nUnusually for films featuring the Singing Sweethearts, this one has a sparky and funny script (largely by Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell) from which it benefits.  Not many songs have survived from the Broadway production of the real &apos;Sweethearts&apos; (sadly, the omissions include &apos;The Cricket on the Hearth&apos;, which was really quite a sweet song), and others have been added to flesh out the Hollywood fantasy.  Perhaps the best numbers are &apos;Pretty as a Picture&apos; and &apos;On Parade&apos;.\n\nIn support are Frank Morgan (&apos;the Wizard of Oz&apos;), Ray Bolger (not used anywhere near enough), and the poor man&apos;s Eddy and Macdonald, Douglas MacPhail and Betty Jaynes, who suffer from a total lack of charisma.  The leads themselves are fine and do with the more meaty than usual material. Perhaps their more slushy collaborations such as &apos;Rose Marie&apos; and &apos;Maytime&apos; are better overall, but &apos;Sweethearts&apos; is definitely worth a look."

      "reviewBody": "Luther Starling (Jeffrey Byron) is a superspy for the American government who after completing his latest mission of retrieving stolen documents sets out on a six week vacation across Europe. Luther is picked up at Heathrow airport in London, England by his friend Roger (Larry Cedar) in his Morgan 3-Wheeler to stay with Roger and Roger&apos;s Aunt Lydia (Mona Washbourne) for the duration of the London leg of Luther&apos;s trip. By chance the two follow a motorcade where British Secret Service agents Bidley and Peters (Roy Kinnear and David Battley respectively) are escorting a recently defected Eastern European scientist, Professor Buchinski (David Kossoff) who possesses a revolutionary new energy formula. However when a team of armed gunmen ambush the motorcade intent on kidnapping the Professor, Luther attempts to intervene but is outmatched but the professor slips a gold ring into his jacket pocket. Upon discovery of the ring, it leads Luther and Roger on an adventure across London as they attempt to rescue the professor from the villainous criminal organization Omega.\n\nThe London Connection (AKA The Omega Connection) directed by Robert Clouse and written by Gail Morgan Hickman and David E. Boston is a 1979 TV movie produced for Disney&apos;s TV anthology The Wonderful World of Disney, though the film was released theatrically in some markets such as the UK where it appeared on a double-bill with a re-release of The Aristocats. Filmed on location in London and at Pinewood Studios, the movie is undeniably a Disneyfied take on the James Bond/Eurospy formula with the gadgets, cold war intrigue, and even Omega being pretty transparently inspired by SPECTRE. While there is still that expected silliness that comes with Disney&apos;s caper fare, The London Connection is surprisingly enjoyable and actually goes above the level of quality from some of Disney&apos;s theatrical releases of the day.\n\nJeffrey Byron makes a solid impression as young superspy, Luther Starling, with a charming good natured charisma that makes him such an appealing lead. Larry Cedar is also well cast opposite Byron as Luther&apos;s friend Roger and there&apos;s a strong buddy dynamic between the two that makes them fun to have an adventure with. The supporting cast is also quite fun with some solid British talent of the era such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory supporting players Roy Kinnear and David Battley playing British Secret Service Agents who find themselves tangled up in Luther and Roger&apos;s sleuthing activities with an amusing running gag about their agency loaned cars never lasting more than one day in their care before being destroyed which is paid off with a humorous sight gag in its final usage. David Kossoff is quite fun as the abducted Professor Buchinski as is Mona Washbourne as Roger&apos;s absent minded Aunt Lydia who scores some pretty funny moments with Kossoff in the third act as well as against some of the actors playing the villains such as Nigel Davenport playing Omega&apos;s Blofeld equivalent Arthur Minton.\n\nBeing directed by Robert Clouse who gave us such martial arts fun as Black Belt Jones and Bruce Lee&apos;s finest film Enter the Dragon, it should surprise no one that there&apos;s a decent amount of action on display. While obviously limited by the fact that it&apos;s A) a TV movie and B) a Disney production so it can&apos;t get &quot;too intense&quot;, the filmmakers find some nice workarounds with their limitations. Despite being a light hearted Disney production Clouse films the movie like he would one of his action films except with more focus on motion and spectacle rather than impact or intensity and Clouse shows a real love of those Bond tropes with a fun chase sequence involving supped up cars and motorcycles complete with machine gun headlights or rear facing rocket launchers to a bevy of gadgets and gizmos that carry the same novelty and fantasy factor from the Bond pictures without the lethal edge. Despite the fact that nobody dies in this movie, the movie does treat its plot with stakes and its villains as threats which is a welcome relief from the generic 1930s type Dick Tracy inspired gangsters that appeared in many of the 70s Disney formula comedies. The one element I didn&apos;t like was the soundtrack which I thought often undermined the craft of the movie and made things seem less impactful.\n\nThe London Connection may be a family-friendly Bond knock-off, but it&apos;s a well made and passionate family friendly Bond knock-off. With a fun sense of adventure, a good cast of capable actors, and some solid craft in its filmmaking. The only real shame is that it&apos;s a relatively obscure film and aside from some PAL VHS releases in the UK it&apos;s never been released on home video nor is it available on Disney+ at the time of this writing. If you can find a copy of this film it&apos;s enjoyable (if a little cheesy), but hopefully it becomes more widely available so it can find renewed life.",

I thought it was the original Lost Boys when I scooped it up with a collection of other older movies.\n\nWhen I realized it was not the original, I had hopes for something similar to the original (in quality) but I was disappointed.\n\nThe quality of the story line waxes and wanes. I totally get the parallel to the original movie, but the weak fight scenes and effortless slaying of the vampires left me thinking it would not have been difficult to do a better job of those scenes, had someone actually WANTED to present something better than what was shown.\n\nOne moment the vampires are demonstrating incredible speed and strength, then they are killed with very little effort. A group of vampires who &quot;are capable of knowing what you are thinking before you do&quot; are surprised and killed because they didn&apos;t see what was coming next in the mind of their slayer.\n\nYes, there were a few very attractive young women with very little clothing, and while that might carry a film to a certain degree, it wasn&apos;t quite enough to save this movie.\n\nIf I had to guess, they blew the budget on the initiation scene and had nothing left to fund a solid set of fight scenes.\n\nCorey Feldman&apos;s performance may have been the highlight of the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I like Public Enemy (the group) a lot. And I think Flavor Flav is funny (in his own crazy way), but I never felt like watching the &quot;Flavor of Love&quot; reality show. I did see a few clips and thought it was just awkward. Now if you&apos;ve seen the show or a few clips, just imagine that guy introducing Horror stories. Scared yet? You should be, but for all the wrong reasons.\n\nFlav is not working as a host. Even if there weren&apos;t other memorable characters (like the Cryptkeeper from the Tales from the Crypt series/show), you wouldn&apos;t rank him as a good host. But should that bother you if the stories themselves had something to offer? Of course not. Unfortunately, the story have not much to offer.\n\nEspecially when you realize that this was a test run for a TV show. And they still went on to produce that (boy am I so NOT looking forward to watch that). Why not give it a one star rating. I thought that the last of the 3 stories had some potential. As did the other stories, but especially the first one is so badly done, that you wonder why on earth this exists. Ticking of the boxes in your script is not enough to make a good/watchable movie.\n\nStill waiting for the Tales from the Crypt complete (DVD/Blu Ray) set to come out.",

      "reviewBody": "A film like John Cassavetes&apos; &quot;The Killing of A Chinese Bookie&quot; is one of those films that Roger Ebert often says &quot;either grabs you or leaves you&quot;. This one grabbed me. It is perhaps the least liked film of the precious few Cassavetes wrote and directed, but it&apos;s an honest film that doesn&apos;t pull any punches. It&apos;s kind of a predecessor to &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Casino&quot;.\n\nWhile Cassavetes&apos; film lacks the polish of the two Scorsese films, I think that benefits &quot;Killing&quot;. This is not a glossy, &quot;high-concept&quot; film that Hollywood prefers (although Scorsese is certainly not &quot;high-concept&quot;); it is a rough, confusing muddle and that is probably one of the reasons the film remains highly unseen by a great many people. However, I like rough, confusing films and one of the great pleasures is trying to figure everything out.  The beauty of a John Cassavetes film is that there are no easy answers and he likes you to make your own reading on the film.\n\n As always with a Cassavetes film, he gives juicy parts to his regulars. Ben Gazzara is excellent as Cosmo Vitelli, the nightclub owner who needs to perform the title deed to save his club. Seymour Cassel gives a strong performance as a friend of Cosmo. Cassel and Gazarra are two of those actors whose names you won&apos;t recognize, but when you see their faces, you&apos;ll recognize them. They love to take risks with their performances and you can see the payoffs for yourselves.\n\nAfter a half-assed release by Buena Vista in 1989, &quot;Killing of A Chinese Bookie&quot; is finally available on tape and DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment. The transfer is clean and looks great and the letterbox presentation shows that Cassavetes knew how to use his camera, even if the aspect ratio is small.",

It is not exactly the best, but it is good enough to watch for those who like revenge stories! Sunny Deol does action like no other hero, and he is the best after his dad, Dharmendra. Overall, this is a decent action movie to watch, and if you catch it on TV, do it mainly for our Jat hero, Sunny Deol. Enjoy!!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Breakout&quot; is easily one of Charles Bronson&apos;s best starring vehicles. For the most part his early 70&apos;s films fell into two categories: either junky (Violent City) or pretentious (The Mechanic). The first Death Wish film was thought-provoking, but marred by sickeningly graphic and misogynist violence; the sequels had the violence with none of the art. His late-70s films were quickie garbage (Death Hunt, Love and Bullets). His 80&apos;s films featured a sickly prurient violence level and a sleepwalking star.\n\nBut Bronson did have quite a string of quality films in the mid-70s: &quot;Breakheart Pass (1974),&quot; &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1975), &quot;Mr. Majestic&quot; (1974), &quot;From Noon Til Three&quot; (1976), and &quot;Telefon&quot; (1977)were all quality films in which Bronson&apos;s star quality, charisma, and acting ability was able to shine through. \n\nThe best of Bronson&apos;s mid-70s output in my opinion, however, is Tom Gries&apos; &quot;Breakout.&quot; The story has drama, humor, and tremendous forward momentum, the cast is superior (Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, John Huston, and the always-underrated Jill Ireland). Most importantly, Charles Bronson breaks out of his silent-and-stony persona and creates a character that has depth, humour, and humanity as well as toughness.\n\nThose who complain that this film has little action have obviously not seen many of Bronson&apos;s films. Very few of them are actually what could be called &quot;action movies&quot;. For the most part they were melodramas with some gunplay, the occasional fight, and a maybe car chase near the end. &quot;Breakout&quot; is actually as much or more of an action film than most of Bronson&apos;s others. I think that most folks who mistakenly lament the lack of &quot;action&quot; in this film compared to his others are confusing &quot;action&quot; with sick, perverse violence. Look at &quot;Death Wish&quot; for instance: Bronson shoots some guys. That&apos;s the extent of the action, if you exclude the graphic rape scene near the beginning. He points a gun and shoots. He rarely runs. There&apos;s never a car chase.  It&apos;s a melodrama, not an action film. `Breakout&apos; has a helicopter escape, a fistfight on a dark runway as a twin-prop plane approaches at breakneck speed, and an attitude that make it more of an action film.\n\nSo &quot;Breakout&quot; doesn&apos;t have graphic torture, or rape, or someone getting sodomized with a nightstick. I&apos;ll settle for a great story, fine acting, cool action, and interesting characters."

      "reviewBody": "I was stunned at what this film did to me. An absolutely brilliant display of psychological horror. Alan Parker made the scariest film of the eighties, maybe the scariest film of the second half of the century with this picture. The hell with &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; is where it&apos;s at if you want horror.\n\nI don&apos;t know how Parker hasn&apos;t become the Hitchcock of his generation after this film. I know some of his other work - &quot;Evita&quot; and Mississippi Burning&quot; are two films of his that I happen to think are pretty good. But they&apos;re nothing like this. What Parker does so well here, what he seems to get better than any other director I&apos;ve noticed since this film was made, is how atmosphere makes a movie. He has a real sense of place and time that&apos;s a key component to making the terror of this movie real.\n\nAside from Parker&apos;s talents, there are three performances without which the movie just wouldn&apos;t work.\n\nRobert de Niro gives the second best performance of his career here, right next to &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, and even that&apos;s pretty close. I&apos;m not even normally a huge fan of de Niro&apos;s - I mean, don&apos;t get me wrong, he&apos;s a legend, but I find most of the time that I&apos;m less impressed with him than most people are. Not here. In this movie, de Niro makes the simple act of eating an egg into a treatise on mortal dread. He should have received the Oscar for this performance, no question about it.\n\nLisa Bonet - what happened to her? Every couple of years I&apos;ll see her in something like this or &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, and she&apos;s got all this charisma - she really is a superb actress. What she does here is really interesting because you can see that it&apos;s very underdone, a lot of subtlety. Which is a strange way to go if you&apos;re playing a voodoo priestess. But she&apos;s very vulnerable here. I think it&apos;s a shame she didn&apos;t become the star she could have. I&apos;d love to see more work from her.\n\nMickey Rourke is another resident of the &quot;Where are they now?&quot; file. I&apos;ve heard more from him recently though. He&apos;s been making a comeback of sorts. He&apos;s actually the primary reason I rented this movie, because I saw him in Sean Penn&apos;s &quot;The Pledge&quot; and wanted to see more of his stuff. He&apos;s the third performance that makes this movie complete, and he&apos;s the one who really has the hardest job, who has to strap it to his back and get it across the finish line. His is also the most important job, because he needs to instill the terror in you. It&apos;s through his eyes that you witness these bizarre events, and it&apos;s his reaction that makes it all the more terrifying.\n\nAgain, brilliant. Can&apos;t say enough about it. The last thirty seconds or so kind of sucks (those of you who&apos;ve seen it know what I&apos;m referring to), but I can just turn it off before that. Oddly, it doesn&apos;t ruin what&apos;s come before."

      "reviewBody": "Heaven help me! I liked this movie, now I am going to be one of the few who did. As you can see from the other reviews a lot of people didn&apos;t like this movie, so why did I? \n\n1. I came in with low expectations - I was expecting something horrible, boring, long and pointless, but despite myself I liked it, I laughed at the jokes, I connected with the actors (yes, Rihanna too), I was excited by the action and while clichés the plot held my interest \n\n2. The actors did a good job with what they were given - Taylor Kitsch did a good job, Rihanna wasn&apos;t that bad, I dare say good, in her role. She was there, she didn&apos;t try to chew the scenery, she did her job as an actor/secondary character and it didn&apos;t bother me. I give her kudos\n\n3. lost in translation? - you try to make a game into a movie and you want to put parts of them game in it? Not easy, a little cheesy? Of course, but fun? Yes, fun, enjoyable, and in the end it was a part of the story that wasn&apos;t as forced as it could have been. \n\nSo in conclusion, &quot;Battleship&quot; is a fun, corny, typical summer movie that I like but as you see a lot of people didn&apos;t. I think it is a guilty pleasure, something to be enjoyed by the few but annoyed by the rest. In the end I can only suggest this - go in with low expectations, expect a little over the top patriotism like in &quot;Act of Valor&quot; ( but not so heavy), and don&apos;t think about it. The movie is not without its flaws or questionable logic, but as it was said so well in another movie - &quot;I suggest you don&apos;t think about it and just enjoy the ride&quot;",

It is a very live, frank, surprising portrait of the life of a common man in Lisbon during the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s.\n\nIt was very much influenced by the Italian Neo-realism, but it&apos;s cinematically much more stylish than most of those features. There are some wonderful shots of Belarmino training, strolling through the streets of Lisbon or at home with his family.\n\nThe main flaws, for me, are in the interviews, which, maybe because of the editing, become repetitive at times.\n\nCompare to Kubrick&apos;s &quot;Day of the Fight&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Since June 2013, I&apos;ve been working one or two days a week at a liquor store where my dad has worked since 2004 and managed for several years in addition. It&apos;s my first job and it&apos;s been something of a roller-coaster that doesn&apos;t deserve explicit mention here at this point in time. Being under the legal age to drink in America, I never paid much attention to beer pricing, beer brands, and the humongous industry the product housed, but now, I always find myself heading to the beer sections of grocery stores to compare prices, brands, and the variety of their products versus ours.\n\nSince June and because &quot;big beer&quot; vs. craft beer is a debate I constantly find myself in, I made an effort to watch Beer Wars, a documentary that analyzes the heated competition between domestic, mass-produced beer brands and small-scale, often local or regional craft beer breweries. To start, when I say &quot;domestic beer brands&quot; I mean the big three brands that have monopolized the beer industry for decades now - Miller, Coors, and Anheuser-Busch. When I say &quot;craft beer breweries,&quot; I mean independently run breweries that are down several notches from the big industry that brew their own unique flavors. In the long run, that seems to be the main difference between craft beer and domestic beer - the taste. While the big three beer companies seem to want to focus on gimmicks like an indicator on the bottle to tell you how cold your beer is, punch-top cans, and meaningless &quot;vortex bottles,&quot; craft beer companies look to make sure your pale ale is flavorful and works in a special way for you. The main flavor of domestic beer seems to be adjunct American light lager.\n\nThe woman behind Beer Wars is a woman by the name of Anat Baron, who worked for Mike&apos;s Hard Lemonade during its inception but has remained out of the beer industry for several years since. However, the hops stayed in her blood so-much-so that she decided to make a documentary showing the brutal, unbridled war between the craft and the mainstream beer industry. Recently, imported beer sales, craft beer sales, and sales on wine and spirits have been steadily increasing, leaving domestic beer in somewhat of a slump. Just last week, it was reported Anheuser-Busch saw a whomping 28.8% decrease in Budweiser sales and Michelob, another A-B brand, saw an unfathomable 70% drop in sales.\n\nBaron indicates this is largely due to the blandness and neutrality of the three beers. In a single-blind study at a bar, several people were given samples of Miller Lite, Coors Lite, and Bud Light, many of them mistaking one beer for the other. We&apos;re informed that the reason the industry is monopolized by three giants is because before Prohibition, 1800 breweries existed. Then when Prohibition was lifted, many breweries came back to the surface. But by 1978, only forty-five breweries remained because small-scale companies either went bankrupt or were bought by those who had more money. This lead to A-B, Coors, and Miller gaining prominence to eventually becoming the main choices when you go to a grocery store or a liquor store. Even the famous Blue Moon beer, with its box-art designed to appear like a typical craft beer, stating it was brewed by the Blue Moon Brewing Company was actually made by Miller in efforts to make consumers think it was an entirely different product by an entirely different company.\n\nIn recent times, the smaller guys have been taking the craft market by storm. What started as a hobby of basic home brewing, the act of making beer at home, has emerged into an industry that is growing rapidly and actually making the bigger companies sweat. Even in a slumping American economy, paying $10, $12, or sometimes $16 for a six pack of craft beer seems to be more attractive than paying $5 for a six pack of light lager made by one of the big corporations. However, some will see the pricetag of craft brews, roll their eyes, and purchase something much cheaper with a much weaker effect.\n\nBaron focuses on the owners of these craft breweries that are gaining steam, one of which is owned by Sam Calagione. The soul Baron chooses to devote most of the focus to is Rhonda Kallman, a determined beer entrepreneur with her product &quot;Moonshot,&quot; a beverage that combines the smooth, drinkable taste of beer with the added boost of caffeine for what, she says, fulfills and a need in the market that is not yet taken care of. Kallman attends numerous meetings, trying to find the appropriate investors for her product and trying to keep her in the business one more day. At nights, she bar-hops, offering patrons to sample her beer, promising them she&apos;ll buy their favorite beer if they don&apos;t like her&apos;s. After giving out dozens of bottles, she hasn&apos;t bought one beer yet.\n\nThis wouldn&apos;t be half the struggle it is if Kallman wasn&apos;t married with two children. Her husband comments that she has no idea how she does it because she takes advice from numerous different people, many of which younger and more inexperienced than she, but she still listens to all compliments and criticisms of her product. Even her toddler-age kids want mommy to stay home, but they know she has a very important dream to fulfill.\n\nBeer Wars is a captivating documentary. At only eighty-eight minutes, it provides a thoughtful rundown of the big brewers, the smaller ones, the souls struggling to keep their smaller products fresh and selling off the shelves, and the lobbyists of the industry that want to keep Miller, Coors, and A-B in power. Few documentaries would&apos;ve done such a colossal industry justice in a short amount of time, but Baron makes it look as easy and accomplished as chugging an eight ounce can of Miller Lite.",

This also means that the movie is quite an unique one really, which is something that still makes this movie interesting and a good watch.\n\nThing I&apos;m still confused about is if it was supposed to be Christian propaganda or one that criticizes and openly questions it. That movie does both things really, which also does make the movie more or less unpredictable, which is however also a positive thing though of course. Perhaps this was also exactly what the film-makers were aiming for; confuse its viewers so that they can openly question and think about things and get into discussions with each other. Seems to me that everybody will interpret this movie in their own way and both Christians and atheists can both get plenty out of this movie.\n\nSo really no matter how you feel about this movie, you&apos;ll still get intrigued by it. This is a great power that this movie has and the foremost reason why I actually ultimately ended up liking it, even though I didn&apos;t always understood what was going on exactly.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem with the movie. It gets a quite messy one at times and due to its storytelling, we have to take a lot of things for granted. Not everything feels- and flows naturally, which doesn&apos;t always make this the most believable movie.\n\nBut perhaps it feels a bit off and odd just because the movie is taking such an original approach and features an unique concept in it. Because of that it is hard to compare this to anything we know and are familiar with. It&apos;s just a one of a kind movie that you should also take that way. Don&apos;t think too much about its storytelling or acting, just focus on its themes instead and you&apos;ll see that this is a quite good and intriguing movie.\n\nChristian or atheist; the movie doesn&apos;t really pick &apos;sides&apos; with anyone and everyone will get something different out of this movie.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "WITH THIS BEING the second Tarzan romp starring Gordon Scott, the improvement that was evident in the initial Scott feature, TARZAN&apos;S HIDDEN JUNGLE, was continuing to come to fruition. The speech pattern displayed by Mr. Edgar Rice Burroughs&apos; creation was going much more toward that of an educated person and away from the &quot;Me Tarzan, you Jane&quot; routine.\n\nPRODUCED BY THE combined forces of America&apos;s Sol Lesser and Britain&apos;s Solar Productions, this was filmed mostly in the United Kingdom, with some great deal of footage being filmed in Africa. The making of movies was becoming less a regular thing for Mr. Lesser, who would turn over his screen rights to the character to producer, Sy Weintraub.\n\nAFTER TAKING OVER the Tarzan series from MGM, Mr. Lesser first used the reigning apeman, Olympic swimmer, Johnny Weismueller, who in turn gave way to Lex Barker and then to Gordon Scott. The pictures were his productions, but they were released by RKO Radio Pictures. Their association lasted up to the first Scott feature and then various other distributors were employed.\n\nTHIS FEATURE MARKED the return of MGM to the Tarzan stories as the prestigious &apos;Tiffany Studio&apos; was retained as the films&apos; booker in the U.S.A. Reviving their interest in the Jungle epic, MGM would soon do its own production of TARZAN THE APEMAN (remake,1959) with Denny Miller in the loincloth this tome.\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHY, BOTH in studio and on location, was well integrated into what appeared to be seemless; kudos to the photography guys. All of the animals you&apos;d suspect showed up and to the first time (at least to our recollection), they were all of the species Loxodonta africana or in our vernacular, African Bush Elephant. In just about every prior picture, the Pachyderms were of the Elephas maximus persuasion (Indian Elephant). Some sported &quot;falsies&quot; on screen; those being add-on larger false ears to render heir appearance to look African. \n\nTHIS PICTURE MARKED the first time that Tarzan was seen in color, a habit that he wouldn&apos;t shake for a long time. (Although at least one other movie, the patch quilt TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS-a combination of 3 episodes from the failed and unsold Tarzan TV series, reverted to B &amp; W. )\n\nAS FOR THE story, we have nothing out of the ordinary; just another day at the (Jungle) office. Lost expedition from crashed airplane is saved from hostile natives who are being employed by evil White Hunter/Ivory poacher, Tusker Hawkins (Robert Beatty. Lovely ladies Yolanda Donlan and Betta St. John are present to make an absent Jane potentially jealous. The rest of the featured cast is rounded out by Wilfred Hyde-White, Peter Arne, Nigerian born Orlando Martins and former Orson Welles associate, George Coulouris. Veteran character actor, Don Beddoe, makes an uncredited appearance as a partner in the illicit Ivory trade.\n\nWE FOUND THE picture to be a worthwhile Jungle tale and what was most important about a Tarzan movie, it was fun.",

The movie isn&apos;t as much about drugs as it is about the struggle of a woman to stay clean and turn her life around in order to prepare herself to be a better mother. The story is told with a lot of subtle dark undertones but it is told with sincerity and there is no pretension about it. Assayas really avoids clichés and his main intention really seems to be to tell a genuine human story. Maggie Cheung delivers a breathtaking performance as the desperate Emily Wang. This is perhaps her final film before she&apos;s moved into retirement (though I hope she does come back and do more films because it would be a waste of her talent). Her performance is subtle but it speaks volumes. Likewise, Nick Nolte does an equally amazing job as Emily&apos;s sympathetic and strong-minded father-in-law. It is easily one of his best performances. The supporting cast does well too. Beatrice Dalle especially stands out as Emily&apos;s friend. In addition, the soundtrack is pretty mesmerizing and it wonderfully adds to the film giving voice to the silent moments. &apos;Clean&apos; is relevant film especially for those who have survived addiction and still struggle with it every day but that is not to say that it&apos;s another one of those preachy this-is-what-you-should-do movies. It has a universal appeal and if Maggie Cheung has chosen this as her last film then it&apos;s a fine choice (but of course I hope that she does come back to do more)."

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t believe the reviews I have read about Top Gun being technically inaccurate, not enough character development, an overall simple and childish plot... gimme a freegin&apos; break! This film was made to look cool, sound cool, and define cool. Yeah, okay, the MiG-28s are really F-5 Tigers; I&apos;ve read the &apos;goofs&apos; section before. And Tom Cruise&apos;s height. And about &apos;Maverick going supersonic - I&apos;ll be there in 30 seconds,&apos; and the laws of physics preventing him from covering 200 or so miles from the carrier in that time. Whatever! So what! If Top Gun had tried to be accurate and true-to-life in every respect, it would have been some oh-so-serious flick like Courage Under Fire. Here&apos;s some examples of what I mean:\n\n1 - what&apos;s the best way to evade cannon fire? Do a snazzy barrel roll. Problem solved!\n\n2 - the MiG pilots have tinted visors. The good guys don&apos;t. Go figure.\n\n2.5 - Russian planes are actually grey or green. The MiG 28s are black. The Tomcats are... yeah, you guessed it... white! Good vs. Evil.\n\n3 - Modern air-to-air combat is usually fought at distances of tens of miles between aircraft. Top Gun uses much cooler spitting-distance WWI era tactics.\n\n4 - &quot;It&apos;s too close for missiles. I&apos;m switching to guns!&quot; Enough said.\n\n5 - the generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over by the fuming air-control officer. We never see him get up. Classic.\n\n6 - even the edited TV version is a few steps above normal-cool. &quot;... you&apos;ll be flying a cargo plane [edit]... out of Hong Kong!&quot;\n\n7 - the way Iceman says, &quot;Mayday, Mav&apos;s in trouble. He&apos;s in a flat spin, and heading out to sea.&quot;\n\n8 - the graceful way Top Gun maintained a PG rating, without using the F-word once.\n\nTop Gun came out in 1986. That&apos;s 1986. Seventeen years ago. It rocked then... it rocks now. Just watch it and have some fun."

      "reviewBody": "HELLBOY II threatens to be nothing more than your latest CGI-laden braindead Hollywood action movie, and yet it&apos;s not, thanks to the presence of director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro has to possess one of the most imaginative minds in Hollywood and he brings a level of creativity to the movie that&apos;s sorely lacking in most genre fare getting released these days. Del Toro&apos;s imagination comes to the fore in the myriad creatures he creates for this movie, bringing to life monster upon monster with no end to the creativity in sight.\n\nEven better, the producers have the budget to match the vivid creations coming out of the minds of this film&apos;s makers, and the special effects do not disappoint. The CGI in this movie is phenomenal, with not a single effect out of place. Having just sat through the dodgy, odd-looking chimpanzees of RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, I&apos;m doubly impressed by the quality of the CGI in this movie (which was made with a lower budget than the ape film, it has to be said). It&apos;s an entirely visual film, one which never disappoints.\n\nThe plot, of course, is secondary to the effects, but that doesn&apos;t matter so much this time around. As usual, there&apos;s a bad guy (Luke Goss, returning as a del Toro villain after BLADE II) who wants to take over the world and who has all manner of mean and wild creations to help him in the process. Up against him is Hellboy and his companions. The return of welcome old faces is great (and kudos to the writers for giving the excellent Abe Sapien a bigger part this time around) and the new character of Johann Krauss is similarly a work of genius. Hellboy is his usual wisecracking self and Perlman brings plenty of laconic humour to the part.\n\nThe narrative pretty much leads from one wild set-piece to the next, with some more effective than others. Hellboy&apos;s encounter with the nature god is my favourite part of the film, although the run-in with the titular army at the movie&apos;s climax is also fairly exhilarating. Okay, so this isn&apos;t a great movie – the story doesn&apos;t hold up to a great deal of scrutiny, after all is told – but it looks the part and I can&apos;t dislike any movie with this level of sheer inventiveness behind it.",

      "reviewBody": "Like the rest of the English-speaking world, I&apos;ve recently succumbed to poker-mania, and started wasting some of my spare cash in amateur Texas Hold &apos;Em games.\n\nDue to my newfound interest in card-playing, and my appreciation for old movies, I picked up &quot;The Cincinatti Kid&quot; on DVD. And I sure wasn&apos;t disappointed. The movie&apos;s awesome, on so many levels. As you might expect, the poker scenes are incredibly tense and, from what little I know of the game, they&apos;re pretty realistic. But other aspects of the film are great, too.\n\nThe New Orleans location shooting is gorgeous. You get to see a lot of the city, so I imagine the crew must&apos;ve spent a fair amount of time there. There&apos;s plenty of cool jazz numbers and some nice French Quarter atmosphere. Director Norman Jewison manages to imbue New Orleans, and the movie as a whole, with an atmosphere that&apos;s both sleazy and glamorous at the same time.\n\nThe strong cast is another highlight. Steve McQueen is understated yet compelling, while Joan Blondell hams it up in a highly entertaining fashion (I love how she keeps teasing Lancey Howard about his age). Edward G. Robinson, one of my favorite character actors, radiates class and even a little menace as Howard. And - this is the best part - the movie also features the sweetly beautiful Tuesday Weld and the painfully sexy Ann-Margret. You just can&apos;t lose with a multi-generational cast of stars (and babes) like that.\n\nSome commentators have complained that &quot;The Cincinatti Kid&quot; is slow, particularly during the scenes that don&apos;t feature poker. I can&apos;t say that I agree. The McQueen-Weld romance is sweet, and it doesn&apos;t really take up that much screen time. Sure, the movie may seem a little plodding if compared to contemporary films, but then again even &quot;Aliens&quot; is plodding compared to contemporary films.\n\nThe theme song&apos;s catchy, too. What more do you need? This movie&apos;s a mini-classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Yeah, I know I only gave this movie a 7, but the vote is a relative thing. Not everything can be a 10. If I were voting on the basis of genre, then definitely a 10. Anyways, I digress. Under the Cherry Moon is the finest movie Prince ever directed (and if you&apos;ve seen the abysmal Graffiti Bridge, you know what I mean), and the fact that he took over from Mary Lambert (who went on to direct the ludicrously bad Pet Sematary)at the last minute, further proves my point. Prince and erstwhile sidekick Jerome Benton play a pair of hustlers who make no bones about their profession; in fact, the fun they have is so infectious, it seems to take all the sleaze out of it. Merrily they go along until Christopher (Prince) lays eyes on Kristin Scott-Thomas and goes completely ga-ga, forgetting altogether the pair&apos;s objective of swindling her out of her fortune. This is a fun movie, one that manages to evoke the feel of a 30s screwball comedy injected with a modern sensibility. The music is among Prince&apos;s finest (and most cohesive album-wise), and most rhythmically inventive. Don&apos;t rent this expecting to see a work of cinematic art; this is pure entertainment, plain and simple. If you&apos;re looking for something you can watch strictly for fun, check this one out. For those who have seen it and love as I do, I have two words for you: Wrecka Stow!",

The status quo is something you don&apos;t approve of, but you don&apos;t have the willpower to break through and change yourself or rather the way you live. It probably one of the few cases to depict this quite exceptional, without really pointing it out. In a way this is quite amazingly done.\n\nAnd then there is the case! Yes Susan Sarandon and yes Willem Dafoe - but what Sam Rockwell in a small scene too? And even David Spade in a role that will not annoy many (though also not make many laugh as he is able to do). The story itself is pretty straightforward but it is the layers that really should get to you - that is if you are looking for them. Maybe you&apos;ll just enjoy a thriller, which also is not a bad thing at all. Human depths and flaws be damned",

This is one of the most hypnotic films you&apos;ll ever see and is one that stays in the mind for days afterwards. Think Leone, Fellini and Peckinpah joining forces to make a mystical, existential and spiritual western and you&apos;re someway close to Jodorowsky&apos;s masterpiece. There are so many things to like and admire in this film from the sometimes purposely jarring editing and the beautiful music to the gorgeous vistas inhabited by a plethora of interesting and unusual characters. Track down a copy (Italy&apos;s Raro video currently has a decent dvd on release. I got mine from xploitedcinema) and you will not regret it.  Be warned though - some of the images are pretty extreme, especially for 1971. A stunner and a definite must have for any serious film collector."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; is your standard kiddy flick of conflict and resolution with much detail to the 3D imagery and not enough to keep Mom and Dad entertained. The story brings nothing new to the party; it&apos;s like the friend that you invite and tell him to bring a side dish. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; spends all night baking cookies for everyone. &quot;Despicable Me&quot; puts forth an effort by bringing barbecue weenies in a Crock Pot. &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; takes the time and mixes 7-Up and punch. Then there is &quot;Alpha and Omega,&quot; who stops at the local gas station and picks up a fun sized bag of Doritos for itself and arrives 30 minutes late. \n\nThe story begins by introducing us to the main characters, Humphrey (voiced by Justin Long, the guy from the Apple commercials) as the Omega wolf and Kate (voiced by Hayden Panettiere from &quot;Heroes&quot;), as the Alpha wolf. They are acquaintances at the beginning of the movie, where it is hinted at that Humphrey has a crush on Kate. After a winter at Alpha school Kate is being trained to become a leader of the pack and Humphrey is still palling around with his knucklehead friends.\n\nHumphrey and Kate&apos;s wolf pack has a rival pack that is trying to take the caribou hunting from them. That doesn&apos;t fare well with Winston (voiced by Danny Glover) who is not only the leader of the pack but also Kate&apos;s father. And, who is the leader of the rival pack? It&apos;s Tony (voiced by Dennis Hopper, in his last film), who has some unexplained history with Winston. Tony. Really? This great wolf is the leader, the old wise sage, and that&apos;s the best name they could come up with? Tony the Wolf. Sounds too much like Tony the Tiger. \n\nHumphrey is in love with Kate but she is arranged to be courted by the rival pack&apos;s Alpha male, Garth. The packs have a ritual where the adolescents meet at a mountain in Jasper National Park to howl at the moon. It&apos;s comparable to going to a junior high dance at the taxidermy display inside a Cabela&apos;s. There was a song and dance element here that felt out of place. I felt uncomfortable to see these wolves dance seductively together in a kid&apos;s film. At that point, I understood why wolves chewed off their own leg when caught in a trap. \n\nAt the &quot;howling&quot; Humphrey and Kate are hit with a dart gun and transported from their park in Canada to a park in Idaho. Here they are set free and it&apos;s up to them to find a way back home. \n\nThe couple is eventually befriended by Marcel, some sort of a cross between a Canadian goose and either a bald eagle or a vulture (I couldn&apos;t tell) and his side kick Paddy, a yellow duck. These two birds are avid golfers. Hitting the golf ball gives the movie a reason to exploit their 3D technology. Hey, you paid for it; you might as well use it, right guys? \n\nMarcel and Paddy keep showing up during the movie to act as guides for Humphrey and Kate. It&apos;s not fully explained how these four keep running into each other but it just so happens that they always show up at the right time. \n\nThe rest of the picture is about how Humphrey and Kate work as a team to get back home while realizing an Alpha and Omega wolf can have deep feelings for each other. \n\nShould you see this movie? Nope. It was trying to be kiddy movie with goofy elements of bathroom humor and at the same time a movie with adult themes about falling in love. \n\nThe 3D action sequences were well done. There were several scenes of Humphrey finding old trees to slide down hills and incorporate the first and second person angles of sliding. And, as my 11-year-old daughter pointed out, whenever these wolves needed an old tree to use as a sled it just so happened to be within reaching distance. How many dead trees are there in a forest? \n\nIf you absolutely feel that you still need to go, bring your kids if they are under the age of 10 and if they have very little imagination on their own. Or just wait until it&apos;s out on DVD because after you spend $10 each you won&apos;t be howling with excitement, it will be more of a whimper.",

Although he doesn&apos;t have the same &quot;star-power&quot; or pull factor as the other leads, he is more than solid. Fetch does a good job as well. Müller-Elmau is a bit too over the top for my taste.\n\nAt the end of the day. This is a German classic. A road movie, a rather unsurprising conclusion, known tropes and the most generic type of plot structure. But it works!\n\nDoesn&apos;t break any ground. But works great for what it is.\n\n8/10.",

The jokes are good, but some Germans might find their accents off-putting.\n\nI think this movie is funny and if the DVD had English subtitles on all the extras (having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad) I would buy it up in a snap!\n\nI recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.",

      "reviewBody": "Cat People is smart. Like most remakes that stand a chance, it keeps what worked in the original and reinvents it, twisting the narrative into something else. It&apos;s just a shame that this new narrative, for all its sexual implications, isn&apos;t terribly interesting.\n\nThe beautiful Kinski stars as a young woman who reunites with her religious fanatic brother in New Orleans and begins to realize that he&apos;s involved in a series of murders. Is he just a run of the mill serial killer or is he a &quot;cat person&quot; devouring hookers and tourists all around the French Quarter? Also, could she have this trait within her as well?\n\nI&apos;m not sure if it was the Blu-Ray I watched this on or if it was poor sound mixing in general, but the dialogue is so quiet and muffled that I had to turn the volume all the way up just to hear what everyone was saying before having to crank it down every time there was an attack scene. Eventually, I just turned on the subtitles and treated it like a foreign film.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot to like about Cat People. It has moments of the style, the acting is pretty good, and there&apos;s a twisted sexual perversity running throughout the story., but it&apos;s a bit overlong at nearly 2 hours and there&apos;s not enough to justify this runtime. We still don&apos;t really get a feel for most of the characters and Kinski&apos;s mid-film switch from sheltered, repressed virgin into femme fatale fails to convince.",

For me, this is just a fun-loving group of comedians that love to make their audience laugh, or at least try their damnedest. I had the pleasure of attending the Canadian premiere of the &quot;Slammin&apos; Salmon&quot; in Montreal recently and the Broken Lizard troupe was there to meet and greet the fans and answer questions after the movie. They are true class acts and friendly guys. While I won&apos;t give away any specific jokes I will say that from a fan&apos;s perspective, this is their second funniest film, with Supertroopers of course being the cult favourite. So yes, it is an improvement on Beerfest; the Slammin&apos; Salmon is just straight up funnier. As for regular movie-goers and comedy fans, I highly recommend this film. It was produced with a low budget during the writers&apos; strike, so without a big studio production, it has the fast pacing of a stage show. The focus in this movie is on the JOKES... which is something refreshing to see in a comedy; less emphasis on character development and a complex plot, but more emphasis on keeping the audience consistently laughing. The humour is low brow at times, but is also clever and well-timed, there are many quick one-liners so pay sharp attention to this fast paced comedy, enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It&apos;s less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.\n\nAt its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today&apos;s zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie&apos;s backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.\n\nThe universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That&apos;s mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",

I don&apos;t know if the special effects were great for the time or not, but they looked enough like the real thing for me. Great naval battle scenes and the acting was perfect for the times portrayed of the 1940&apos;s and the real way that military people are mostly low key in planning discussions and carrying out their duties. All very believable scenes with the flavor of the way it really was even in portions that were added to entertain (when history takes a back seat to entertainment). Kenneth More showed his versatility in excelling in such a serious part and Dana Wynter very professional. I don&apos;t know why she didn&apos;t become a larger name here in the States with such pure beauty, grace and honest acting ability. By coincidence I just saw her in another movie In Love And War where she played a totally different type of part and nailed it great. Anyway, if you haven&apos;t seen Sink The Bismarck, then by all means give it a gander. It is time well spent for not only those who enjoy naval movies, but good drama films as well.",

The added bonus on this tale of terror on the golf course is that it mirrors the plot of Jaws almost to a tee (pun intended).  What otherwise would be a really, really stupid story becomes merely ludicrous and funny when compared to the plot from which it originates.  If you are wanting a B-movie full of fun, poor golf humor, even poorer acting, and a possessed lawn mower, then your prayers have been answered.  This movie is quality B shlock horror and should be seen for the cheese factor alone.  I wonder if Spielberg knows that one of his greatest works has been brought down to this level..."
