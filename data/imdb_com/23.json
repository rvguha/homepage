Her friend was annoying at first but then he kind of grows on you with his part in the plot. The characters I felt had good chemistry, the acting was good. I enjoyed it until the end, they just didn&apos;t end it smoothly, left you assuming what the end result was, redo the last 5 minutes of the movie and it would gain a few stars. Also had a decent chase scene. I think it is rewatchable, a guilty pleasure.",

This was the first Tyler Perry movie I&apos;ve seen, and I&apos;m pretty sure this will be my last.\n\nThe improv scenes including Larry the Cable Guy is this films only saving grace. Other than that, it&apos;s a very mundane movie with a weak character arc and and lazy story telling.\n\nI truly believe that Mr Perry used the writers from The Hallmark Channel and asked them to write a generic, by the numbers script and have himself and Larry improvise scenes that add nothing to the story. It just seemed lazy to me.",

He is friendly with fellow-collegian, the wealthy Raj Sinha, and both often end up getting beat-up by goons and Madhu (Raj&apos;s girlfriend) respectively. After they graduate from college, Raj&apos;s maternal uncle asks Ajay to bring his birth certificate so that he could make his passport and find work for him in a department store in Canada. Ajay goes home to look for his birth certificate, but is unable to locate. His mother makes a show of helping him, but instead tears a document and tosses it outside. Ajay puts the document together and finds out that his real name is Ajay Malhotra, his father, Dr. Ravi Malhotra, is still alive, serving a life sentence in prison for killing and stealing a patient&apos;s organs. Ajay questions his mother and finds out that his dad was framed by the hospital owner, Rai Bahadur. He and Asha meet Ravi in prison and swear to avenge his humiliation. He and Raj then set out to collect evidence - not knowing that Raj&apos;s dad, Dr. Sinha, was himself involved in Ravi&apos;s false conviction, and will not hesitate in joining forces with Rai Bahadur to eliminate all possible evidence, and if necessary kill both Ajay and Asha also.",

      "reviewBody": "This had all the makings for a first rate international crime action drama. There is a good premise, of a hit-man agreeing to off a powerful crime boss to pay off a debt, only to discover it was a set-up with himself marked for death, a first-rate cast, a &quot;Shaft&quot;-inspired score by Oscar-winning composer Michel Legrand, and excellent location photography which captures the Los Angeles landscape. So why doesn&apos;t this film work? For one thing, it never settles on a tone, and it swerves between character study to crime drama and doesn&apos;t have enough of either. The character being studied is impossible to care about anyway, the crime aspects are never fully explored, and most the action scenes are mostly ordinary. Even the climactic shootout isn&apos;t all that exciting, in spite of happening in a clever location. The result is that the film is usually depressing. There are a few good scenes and the cast is more than up to the task. However, most of the actors are given little to do. In the lead, the great French actor Jean- Louis Trintignant does little more than glower or sulk, making this one of his less memorable performances. Ann Margaret is beautiful, but her role is merely set decoration. Georgia Engel steals the show as a ditsy housewife who innocently gets caught up in the double cross and violence, but she doesn&apos;t have that large of a role. The truth is, she&apos;s the only person who evokes any sympathy, with everyone else being either a vicious criminal, an inept cop, or an apathetic bystander. That wasn&apos;t an unusual situation in 1970&apos;s crime dramas, but it doesn&apos;t make for exciting viewing. Some people like this movie a lot, so if you&apos;re really interested, judge for yourself, but don&apos;t complain if you were also disappointed.",

It bears a striking resemblance to Robocop, while, at the same time, putting the gory effects of the Peter Weller film to shame. Commercials let us know that this epoch of Tokyo is one where self mutilation and violent death are not only the norm, they are entertainment. Where Robocop addresses the privatization of law enforcement, this film starts after the privatization occurred.\n\nThe woman who plays Ruka is an attractive stoic sort, believable as a tough woman seeking vengeance for her father&apos;s death. Ruka is an &quot;engineer&quot; killer. An engineer, in this movie, is kind of like a Guyver if the movie were done by the effects people from Videodrome. If you don&apos;t like gore, avoid this flick like the plague; although, if you bought or rented a movie called &quot;Tokyo Gore Police&quot; and didn&apos;t expect gore, there isn&apos;t much hope for you.\n\nI gave this movie a seven out of ten because they did try to make a real movie out of this. The concept was a little dumb; but, the world that the movie was set in was interesting...",

      "reviewBody": "Taken as a diverting bit of fluff, &quot;Saratoga&quot; is a pleasant film not worthy of the talents of its cast but easy on the eyes. The plot is in the screwball vein but lacking the manic intensity of the genre; it revolves around a bookie trying to save a horse farm by luring a rich &quot;chump&quot; to lose racing bets &amp; finance the endeavor. Clark Gable, looking alarmingly thin, is the bookie and he delivers his standard performance. Scenery-chewing Lionel Barrymore and blustering Frank Morgan are on hand playing characters they perfected during their careers. Also on board are Una Merkel, Walter Pidgeon, and in a bit role Dennis O&apos;Keefe. Unfortunately all of this is secondary to the only reason this film merits attention: it is the final film of legendary Jean Harlow. \n\nThe tragedy of Miss Harlow has been well documented. She was literally dying while shooting this movie and it is a difficult film to sit through knowing this. In the final 20-25 minutes her character is clearly played by a double hidden behind binoculars, a large hat, or shot from behind. Nobody wanted to finish the movie after Miss Harlow passed away but there was such an outcry from her fans that the picture was completed by a heavy- hearted studio. Ironically it was her biggest hit film largely because everyone wanted to get a final glimpse of her. Her performance is not one of her best; she is lacking her usual energy &amp; effervescence. But it is an incredibly poignant performance knowing the terrible physical pain she must have been suffering during the shoot. \n\nBy all accounts Jean Harlow was an amazing individual; beloved by all and someone who valued the happiness of others over her own. She was more concerned about letting the cast &amp; crew of &quot;Saratoga&quot; down than getting help for her illness. A class act to the end.",

      "reviewBody": "CUBE ZERO, the third and final instalment of the CUBE trilogy, is a prequel to the first movie that attempts to explain more of the background behind the cube installation in an interesting and entertaining way.\n\nThe writers achieve this by presenting another round of participants battling against the various traps and tribulations, which are the goriest yet; the opening death sequence is grisly in the extreme and like something out of WISHMASTER. Running concurrently with this plotting is a behind-the-scenes scenario which shows something of the men who control the cube and their reasons for doing so.\n\nCUBE ZERO is a resolutely low-budget B-movie that gets by on genre goodwill, enthusiastic performances from a game cast and some effective special effects. Michael Riley&apos;s robo-eyed baddie is by far the most fun, but the rest of the characters work too - and, as ever, watching their interactions is a whole lot of fun.\n\nThe twist ending is particularly worthwhile as it ties into the first CUBE in a neat and surprising way. This series may not be one to set your world on fire, but as ever, CUBE is a whole lot of fun.",

      "reviewBody": "In a way this movie is quite recognizable to me. I also have made a deal to marry my best friend when we turn 30. She also has a boyfriend and I&apos;m alone and yes, I do compare all girls to her. But that is as far as the similarities between the movie and my life go. No way that I would ever try to get between her and her boyfriend and certainly not when they decide to get married. \n\nStill, I loved the story and the idea behind it, but I can&apos;t say the same about the whole movie. There were so many things that ruined it for me. For instance: what was all that singing about? Is it really necessary to hear Cameron Diaz singing out of tone for more than two minutes? Do I really want to see the whole family singing a song about love, in the middle of a restaurant? There is only one answer to these questions: the fast forward-button. The same for Cameron Diaz&apos; character. Damn, I start running, kicking and screaming for help if I ever meet a girl like that. I really don&apos;t see what is so great about an overactive, lunatic 20-year old with too much money to spend. \n\nEven though there were many things that I hated, I can&apos;t say the same about the plot. I admit that I didn&apos;t expect to see what I saw. Congratulations to the makers that they made the movie end in this way. \n\nIf all the scenes that annoyed me would have been cut out, I would have loved this movie, although I don&apos;t know if much would have been left of it. Now it crossed the line too many times, annoying me just a little too often. I give it a 6/10 because of the good idea and the unexpected ending of the story, but if it hadn&apos;t annoyed me that much it would have been at least an 8 or a 9. Too bad!",

Cooper is accompanied by his sidekick (William Demarest).\n\nPretty soon, almost everyone is after them, including the bandit.  Loretta Young saves Cooper&apos;s hide more than once in this mildly funny and rather slow-moving film.\n\nLoretta Young gives a strong performance as a woman torn between the bandit and the cowboy.  Cooper is not really believable as the amiable but clutzy cowpoke.\n\nThe plot for this movie is better than average, and I enjoyed the laughs. The worst thing about it is the amount of time spent on horseback.  Most of these scenes were obviously filmed indoors and technically were quite funny.\n\nThe movie is worth watching for its script and Loretta Young.",

Are you forgetting that Cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it is different, it is shocking... That&apos;s why most of you have hated it so much: because it does not try to be pleasing to you. It&apos;s just a story, a very weird one I admit, but after all, only a weird story. It is not a great story, not even a great cinema work, but I believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience, thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer. This movie is, for me, European-artistic-like movie made in the US, and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect. Be it for the courage, or be it for the unique sense of humor.",

Rithy Panh shows us the work done in Cambodia to connect Khmer-society to &quot;modern world&quot;. Farmers, soldiers and children work for a living there and unearthen skulls and bones -their remains from PolPot-regime you can see.\n\n The fear in their mind is portrayed by Rithy Panh in this documentary. As the other work done by Rithy Panh this deals with his people. I like it very much! The movie was awarded 1999 at &quot;Visions du Réel&quot; in Nyon (Switzerland) and at &quot;Cinéma du Réel&quot; in Paris.",

This is a totally different film from 1949, which depicts the life in the Germany after the WW II. I have no idea who wrote the synopsis, but obviously the person mistook this film for the other one. This is the directorial debut of Artur Pohl and tells the story of war refugees as they try to settle in a small town in Germany. Not a bad film, but definitely not the action film described by the other commentator. I would gladly add more lines in order to make the comment longer, but then I would probably have to tell you stories of my life, and I am really not in the mood.

I especially love the performance given by Chad Lindberg who in my opinion should be a star! He makes you love his character, and brings you to tears. As for the look and feel of the film. It is a very moody, sad movie that puts you in a mood and doesn&apos;t want to let you go. Overall I would suggest watching it and letting the story sink in. It&apos;s a great drama! It reminds me of growing up and all the pressures put on people who are just trying to do the right thing, but are constantly pounded down by the decisions they make and others make for them. The score is also a very moody, nice sound that matches the constant rain pounding down on the actors. Wow! Check this film out!",

It&apos;s had a good hand in influencing later creature flicks. The story has a good premise and builds some terrific tension as it escalates to a great claustrophobic climax. What&apos;s clever about this movie is that most of the horror is suggested, we don&apos;t see the parasites much and their elusiveness just helps to create more tension. The makeup effects are decent for a low budgeter and the cast turn in some adequate performances, horror veteran Barbara Steele is a nice addition to the cast.\n\nShivers is a entertaining slice of B horror that manages to live up to its title well. A must-see for Cronenberg fans.\n\n*** out of ****",

First, it wasn&apos;t as bad as I thought. I got this movie for 3 bucks at a video rental store and since I enjoy a real stinker, I thought that it would be good for a laugh. Well, it wasn&apos;t as bad as I hoped for, but since it was entertaining I watched it. As you would probably expect considering that the actors whose names were displayed prominently on the back were from such fine shows such as Saved By the Bell and Baywatch--the acting was pretty bad. Actually, really bad. And the long flowing hair on the Dr. Frankestein was annoying. And the makeup on Frankenstein. However, you cannot totally ruin a story that is as good as Frankenstein, so I would say that this movie will make you laugh at some parts you weren&apos;t supposed to, and pretty much keep you entertained. After all, isn&apos;t that what a movie is supposed to do? I give it a 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1997 (but it&apos;s the future since this movie was made in 1981) and the United States crime rates have skyrocketed, particularly in New York City. To handle the rising prison population and abundance of violent inmates, the government opts to turn New York City into a maximum security fortress for individuals who have committed the most vile crimes. There are no guards inside the prison, only inmates. They form their own society. Guards only intercede if a prisoner attempts to escape. No one gets out alive.\n\n When the president&apos;s plane is hijacked and terrorists bring him into the prison city, convicted felon and soon-to-be resident of the prison, Snake Plissken is asked to do the impossible and bring the president out alive.\n\n The setup is rich and compelling, yet there&apos;s a tremendous amount of backstory that is left untold in &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and that&apos;s part of what makes it work. There&apos;s an air of mystery wafting through the movie that continually begs questions but leaves it up to the viewer to imagine what the answers might be. &quot;Why does Snake have an eyepatch?&quot; &quot;What caused the explosion in crime rates?&quot; &quot;Why does the president have a British accent?&quot; All these questions and more make the movie fun to discuss and re-watch repeatedly, searching for hints that help unravel the mystery.\n\n Kurt Russell is unforgettable as Snake, who should be a loathsome character but instead becomes a hero we have no trouble rooting for. He practically growls every line of dialogue because he crackles with too much anger to simply speak. Somehow, despite everything about him being ostensibly unlikable, he&apos;s still charming in a way. He would make for an incredible dinner party guest. On one hand, he would likely scare most of the guests and make them feel dumb. But on the other hand, he would probably make all of the guests think, &quot;wow, if you have a friend like this guy, you must be a really interesting person.&quot; Inviting him is a big gamble, for sure. Though, it just might pay off.\n\n Along with Snake, the highlight of the movie is John Carpenters music. Find another 1980s movie with a cooler score. I dare you. Carpenter has created two of the most recognizable and undeniably excellent theme music tracks of the 70s and 80s (&quot;Halloween&quot; is the other). And he directed both movies. What an achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns.\n\nTypically silly plot for an Astaire film has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen his secretary. They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right. He runs into Fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father. Silly plot.\n\nThe great songs include A Foggy Day, Things Are Looking Up, Nice Work if You Can get It, and I Can&apos;t Be Bothered Now. Fontaine does not sing, but does a brief (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park.\n\nAlso in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite--Jan Duggan as the lead madrigal singer.\n\nJan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings Nice Work if You Can Get It. Her facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a scene stealer in the W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday.\n\nMuch abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been hideously miscast. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes. Two more would-be disasters. Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with ample comic relief by Burns and Allen.\n\nFun film, great songs, good cast, and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!"

Dr. Robert Verne,Robert Foxworth,gets a dream job working for the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, and sent with his wife Maggie,Talia Shire, to the clean air healthy living surroundings in far off picturesque Maine. It&apos;s there that a number of loggers were killed by some mysterious creature who ended up almost decapitating them.\n\nRight away Dr. Verne sees that things aren&apos;t going right there between the local native American population and the owner of a paper mill that&apos;s defoliating their ancient homeland and hunting grounds.The paper mill owner Bethel Isley, Richard A. Dysrat,is determined to get the unruly Maine Indians lead by collage educated John Hawk, Armard Assante, arrested by the local sheriff for interfering with his operation. As for Hawk he&apos;s just as determined to stop Isley from destroying his forest to the point of putting his life on the line to stop him. What no one realizes is that the paper mill is using high and dangerous amounts of mercury that&apos;s polluting the nearby Androscoggin River and turning everything in it,or that drinks from it, as well as its water supply of the region into mutant monsters!\n\nIt&apos;s one of these mutants a 12 foot tall brown bear who&apos;s been tearing people apart whenever he runs into them in the forest. In fact there&apos;s also other creatures in the area that have been effected by the river who not only go crazy but become totally unafraid of the people in the area and attack them almost at will! The film goes on to show how by polluting our environment we in fact are polluting as well as destroying ourselves. And the killer bears deadly rampage is only a small fraction of the damage that&apos;s to be caused in the film from mercury poisoning. As we see at the end of the movie the by far worst is yet to come!\n\n***SPOILERS*** It&apos;s non other then the at first villain Bethel Isley who comes across as the most heroic as well as sympathetic character in the movie. Knowing that he and his paper mill screwed things up royally he volunteers to get help on his own and ends up becoming one of the killer bears victims. There&apos;s also Indian mystic Hector M&apos;Rai, George Clutesi, who&apos;s suffering from severe brain damage because of ingested mercury in his system who thinks he can talk the bear out of doing any more damage only to get riped apart and torn to pieces by him! The final insult in the movie is that which is done to Maggie Verne who by eating some fried fish, that her husband fished out of the polluted Androscoggin River, that infected her body with the deadly and fetus deforming mercury. In her keeping the fact that she was pregnant from Robert and not willing to have an abortion the upcoming blessed event that&apos;s soon to follow will turn out to be a curse for the Verne&apos;s instead!",

Good looking young performers contribute the main interest. Attempts at atmospheric staging don&apos;t really work, as where Blain meets Lualdi under the (bad continuity) rain where she is protected by her white umbrella.\n\nBrass dominant scoring is interesting and the images are good. The commentary on Italian marriage is curious but we&apos;ve seen it too often in other Italian movies."

Is this *REALLY* the very first movie adaptation of this story? I remember well having seen years ago at school a movie about this story which was very old and (I believe) in black and white and in Portuguese - and I remember liking it. \n\nCouldn&apos;t have been this one version, could it? I don&apos;t think so. I actually thought this would be it, but my expectations went down the drain from the start. First off, this movie is in Spanish! Second, the 3 leading youngsters were supposed to be children (like they were in real life) but what we got here are 3 grown-up teenagers. These two details alone harmed the movie for me, and then the rest of it frankly left a lot to be desired. Even the colored version in English was better than this.\n\nThis one doesn&apos;t even seem that loyal to the real-life story to me and doesn&apos;t show that much of it. Not that I lived in that time, but from the knowledge I got of it...\n\nPlease don&apos;t take so personally my criticism on the fact that this film is Spanish. I have nothing against spanishes or their cinema. The issue here is that this is a Portuguese story and therefore it should be made as a Portuguese movie, never as a movie of another nationality (no matter which).",

      "reviewBody": "This one of my favourite documentaries, because of its accuracy and pace. Unlike other documentaries of the German army&apos;s boot camp I&apos;ve seen, this one goes through the stages of Grundausbildung (German for boot camp) in the correct order and spends the time on each stage it deserves. This one focuses on the hardship of such a training and let us see through the eyes of the people, who have to endure this. Unlike other documentaries, which put their focus on stereotypical questions, like if someone has slept maybe 4 hours in three days, temperature&apos;s below freezing point and he has to do marches, combat training, and such, the last thing on his mind will be the question what he thinks about being trained to kill other people! Not so in this documentary, although those kind of question are asked, too, but they are given their respective place and time. I want to mention that this movie is supposed to be about women in the military, but actually the 4 women portrayed could be anybody, male or female, who enters the military without spending a minute to think of what that really means and who isn&apos;t fit, mentally and physically, for such an occupation.",

All is well until she runs into reporter Robert Montgomery in Colorado Springs (the Wild West in 1931). He&apos;s off to South America and asks Bennett to be good and wait for him. Well that lasts about a month. She runs out of money and goes back to Menjou. Better than it sounds until the hack ending. Solid performances by the stars, especially Bennett, and ably supported by Anita Page, Marjorie Rambeau, Clark Gable (his first MGM film), J. Farrell MacDonald, Clara Blandick, Jack Hanlon (as the sullen brother), and Hedda Hopper. The opening tenement scene is just wonderful. Gable is dynamic is his first big part. Rambeau is always terrific. Page is quite good in a supporting role. Menjou is slimy, but Constance Bennett is front and center and mesmerizing. She was a major star of her time--too bad she&apos;s mostly forgotten now."

There is little insight over what happened before, you understand General Humberto Delgado was an opponent to the regime and wanted to make a revolution; but the 1958 elections go almost unreferred, or the past of the General. \n\nThe director is credited to have said this was &quot;a movie about a lie&quot;. He wasn&apos;t interested in the personality of the General, but rather to depict how the judicial process occurred, the flaws, the links, and what nots.\n\nI believe this is a movie to watch for all those who know Portuguese history and are already comfortable in the subject; for all others, it might be slightly confusing, and the overall importance of the moment, and even some unexplained events in the movie might pass you by.\n\nThe choice of John Ventimiglia for the role of General Delgado, however, was not a happy one. He is a fine actor, but his voice had to be dubbed as he is not Portuguese, and that removed great intensity that might have been present otherwise.\n\nI watched the movie in a special event that was followed by a debate and I learnt a lot afterwards about who was this General, how he got there, other important people of the moment, and all that.\n\nIf you know the story, watch. You&apos;ll certainly learn a lot!",

      "reviewBody": "My family and I saw We Are Marshall Christmas night. I grew up in a Marshall family (Mom &amp; Dad, M.U. grads; my oldest sister was in school at M.U. at the time of the plane crash, as well as her future husband). Dad worked in the newspaper business at the time; and my mom&apos;s father passed away the night of the crash (while we were glued to radio and T.V. reports from Huntington.)\n\nA year later, I was fortunate enough to see the Xavier game portrayed in the film at Fairfield Stadium in person. It is still the single most heart-stirring moment in sports I&apos;ve ever been around.\n\nAttending Marshall myself just a few short years after the tragedy, we cheered for first downs by the Thundering Herd and agonized through fighting to be just competitive. Not all were mindful of the journey.\n\nThe film seems to capture the shock of the crash on the school and the community and the hopelessness both experienced in the times immediately following the crash. Due to time restrictions and to keep the story moving, the struggle to come up with representative football players was kind of oversimplified in the film, but the men who did play in those years are just as important as the heroes of the winning era at Marshall decades later. Not sure if the real Jack Lengyel was as tongue in cheek as portrayed in the movie, but it seems to work.\n\nI think the movie will grow on people across the country not familiar with the story or who had no ties to Marshall/Huntington, in the vein of Hoosiers or Remember The Titans. My wife and sons have heard about it for years...that&apos;s why we wanted to experience the movie together.\n\nThe most incredible sports story I&apos;ll ever witness. I thought about the 75 when Marshall played in Detroit in the Motor City Bowl in 1999 and finished in the top 10 in the country. I think about them every time I visit the Marshall Student Center and see the 1970 team picture on the wall. I knew their names from the newspaper stories and the radio coverage of the era. It is quite a personal memory for me, and one I know I share with thousands, and now, many, many more.",

Or should I just say, a young boy with unresolved mother issues as a result of which others (girls, in particular) have to suffer?\n\nOnce he sets his eyes on the next target, nothing gets in the way. Very cunningly he establishes where the victims live and like a skilled craftsman carries out his hideous crimes, without remorse, second thoughts or hesitation.\n\nPivotal to the story is the appearance of an artist who has an acute interests in these plastic mannequins something that appeals greatly to the disturbed young man. Much as his instincts are ever present she somehow causes him to not be himself which is no little thing.\n\nGreat job has been done to bring intensity on the screen. We follow the troubled man, we agonise as he prepares his next murder, we feel sorrow when he indulges his animal instincts. Elijah wood is outstanding as the loner with a dark secret.\n\nAnother plus would have to be how the director gives it a very 80&apos;s look and feel without ever misleading us from the fact that it is a very modern day story.\n\nUltimately, although the direction by a Frenchman has its obvious advantages it remains a Hollywood movie. Hyperbole, gory scenes for the sake of it and a sense of stretched reality deprive this appealing story from further deserved points.",

      "reviewBody": "(...continued from Part1)\n\nThe most significant encounter, of course, was with the young woman heading to Paris, the &quot;there&quot; in What Time is it There?  I believe she is a ghost and her contact with Xiao Kang and the exchange of the watch is somehow responsible for his peculiar behavior and experiences.  If France can be taken to be a metaphor for death or the &quot;otherworld,&quot; then Xiao Kang&apos;s strange fascination with all things French can be seen as his desire to understand his father&apos;s death.  Viewing an old French film becomes a way to catch a glimpse of the &quot;otherworld&quot; where his father might be.  Drinking French wine may be yet another method to reach the trance-like state that facilitates communication with his father.\n\nTsai explores the various avenues of communication between the living and the dead.  He shows the Buddhist rituals, the food offerings, burning ghost money, etc., intended to establish contact or at least help the deceased. He shows how non-spiritual ways such as memories, mementos, and imagination are all employed to keep that person &quot;alive.&quot;  Xiao Kang&apos;s tampering with time is his idiosyncratic approach.  We even see him using an antenna, a communication device,  to adjust a giant clock. In return for these efforts the deceased is expected to communicate to the living by way of signs or in dreams.  We see Xiao Kang crying in his sleep-perhaps a visitation by his father in such a dream.  His mother desperately looks for signs of her husband&apos;s return, even if it&apos;s only as a cockroach or a fish.\n\nTsai points out in this film that contacting the dead is a difficult and frustrating endeavor only leading to more suffering. He adds that the dead are having an equally difficult and frustrating time communicating with us. Moreover, they are having trouble adjusting to their new reality-at least until reincarnation occurs.   The young woman in Paris is seen wandering aimlessly and communicating only with difficulty with the Parisians.  Her aborted telephone calls can be seen as attempts to contact the living, probably loved ones. There is evidence that these loved ones are somehow getting through to her; the snack plate she nibbles on in her hotel room uncannily resembles food offerings to the dead.  The overwhelming feeling we get from her experience is that of frustration and profound sadness.  Her exhaustion and eventual collapse may indicate her resigned acceptance of death.\n\nXiao Kang&apos;s father though appears to be farther along in the process.  He seems calm and sure in his actions.  His struggle appears over.  His walking toward the Ferris wheel is deliberate, reincarnation imminent.  The film ends here on this hopeful note.\n\nWhat Time is it There? has much in common with Tsai Ming-Liang&apos;s earlier films.  He again explores the difficulty in communicating or establishing connections with others.  Only this time he included the dead in his universe and in the process created a rich and mysterious work.  Despite an elliptical and metaphoric structure, and despite an imperfect understanding of Buddhist philosophy, upon reflection the meaning of What  Time is it There? emerges slowly but surely.",

Not as good as a similar movie made the previous year, &quot;Who&apos;s Minding the Mint?&quot;  I saw a dubbed version of this movie, and that also detracted from the movie.  The addition of Lionel Stander made this movie worth watching.  A group of convicts breaks out of prison to print their own money while everyone in the country is engrossed in the big soccer match, hoping to get back in their cells before the game ends. Stander, however, only wants to break out of prison and get away.  A good plot, a few lags (unlike in &quot;Who&apos;s Minding the Mint?&quot;), and familiar faces like Aldolfo Celli and Terry-Thomas thrown in in small bit-parts.  Hardly a classic.",

Not a big believer in the electoral process, baddie Gundar (Dicky Zulkarnaen) schemes to eliminate his village&apos;s mayor and family. His plan involves using magical &quot;Special Silencer&quot; pills he stole from his monk grandfather. If taken on an empty stomach, they give you impenetrable skin. If taken with food, the cause tree roots to burst from your stomach! The plan goes smoothly until Hendra (Barry Prima), a friend of the deceased mayor&apos;s nephew (got that?), shows up in town and falls for the mayor&apos;s daughter Julia (Eva Arnaz). This is as wild as it sounds. Prima (THE WARRIOR series) pounds plenty of skulls as a fight seems to break out every six minutes or so. There is also some fantastic dubbing, like this exchange after a henchman informs Gundar that Hendra survived an attack and impaled an underling on a tree:\n\nGundar: &quot;Why didn&apos;t you bring Tonto&apos;s body back?&quot; \n\nThug: &quot;I didn&apos;t have a saw.&quot; \n\nGundar: &quot;Oaf!&quot; \n\nThe FX of the tree branches bursting out of people&apos;s stomach is very bloody and, because it is so cheaply done, rather disturbing. It reminds me of the cancer bursting from that guy in VIDEODROME. Not as action packed as Arizal&apos;s 80s efforts, but just as insane.",

      "reviewBody": "This film somehow mixes the red tape nightmares depicted by Kafka with the Catholic church&apos;s man made organization and hierarchy in today&apos;s corporate world, making vis a vis contact with authorities impossible. Apart from the intrigue, this film has Ferreri directing his most dramatic film since &quot;El Cochecito&quot; (Spain, 1960), where his ability to create emotional conflict intermingles with his more satiric and absurdity touch, A facet that&apos;s is very interesting to explore, given that his output post-Grade Bouffe is his body of work that most Ferrei enthusiasts are familiar with. I would argue that this film, along with &quot;Chiedo Asilo&quot; (Italy, 1979) are films that explore Utopian gestures borne of the everyday Utopian man, as it faces the brick wall of bureaucracy and normality and convention. Walking the fine line cinema as &quot;theater of the absurd&quot; of the path explored by Buñuel, Raul Ruiz, Arrabal, Jodorowsky and many others, Ferreri champions (the dadaist-inspired) path less traveled in cinema.",

So I watched it without prejudice and... what did I find? A MASTERPIECE! This is the kind of movie that gets your attention from the first moment, and makes you interested in understanding the characters&apos; psyche, which is very varied: you have the idealistic good guys, the idealistic bad guys, the people that broad their minds understanding that no political dogma is better than individual freedom, etc. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved.\n\nIn this present day, when the ghost of authoritarian regimes still fly over our heads (in my country we&apos;re getting closer and closer to that reality), this movie will make you think about how important love, life and freedom are.\n\nA must see!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Brocéliande&quot; (2002) had taken French fantastic movie to the mountains of the ridiculous, &quot;Gunblast Vodka&quot; (2000) had seriously tainted the (little glorious) reputation of the French thriller with its couldn&apos;t-care-less treatment attributed to this dangerous topic that is the snuff-movies. Here, &quot;Mauvais Esprit&quot; (2003) breaks a new record: it&apos;s the nadir of the French comedy we&apos;ve seen for a long time. We have rarely been so lower in this register with this turkey which contains everything to be excluded in a French comedy.\n\nHow could Laurent Chouchan, the scriptwriter of &quot;Tanguy&quot; (2001) be the author of this &quot;Mauvais Esprit&quot;. One could blame Etienne Chatiliez&apos;s movie for not being true to the social reality but at least, it contained painstaking comical sequences with caustic humor galore. Here, Patrick Alessandrin&apos;s flick reveals a Laurent Chouchan with a totally dried up inspiration. The starting point itself condemns the success of the movie. Indeed: a possessed human being (a child or a grown-up) by a devilish strength is light years away from the planet of originality. It&apos;s a threadbare topic which has been used countless times in several kinds of movie (the most notorious example is of course &quot;the Exorcist&quot; 1973). Using such an ominous subject on a comedy tone might have renewed this theme but unfortunately it&apos;s not the case and not making the viewer smile is quite an achievement from the authors!\n\n&quot;Mauvais Esprit&quot; is plagued with scheduled sudden new developments, jerry-built moments and especially ludicrous or unbearable of vulgarity sequences with intolerable scatological humor. It is also drowned in a spate of clichés. The most notorious one is the fight between Ophélie Winter and Maria Pacôme which seems to occupy more place in the movie than the plot itself. The main comical assets of the movie which could have enabled it to take off have been shelved or worse: forgotten or skipped. The authors are completely incapable of writing one single gag of real invention. The present gags have an overrated reputation. At last, the voice of the actor Michel Muller rapidly proves itself to be boring because it is used in an awkward way. Muller gives the impression of not being there and not really caring about his role.\n\nThe cast is unfathomable. Thierry Lhermitte can be an estimable actor when he works with a director who has valuable expertise in comedy like Francis Veber. Please, do see the delicious &quot;Dîner de Cons&quot; (1998)! But here he&apos;s pitiful and has to team up with Ophélie Winter a so-called actress with more than limited gifts and whose countenance is as expressive as a Barbie doll. Maria Pacôme can&apos;t do anything with such a script and the rest of the cast is reduced to acting archetypal walk-ons.\n\nThe end takes the easy way and ends a cloying of vulgarity opus whose making was seemingly grueling. Much effort for nothing and once again so much money spent on a dud like this one goes beyond me.",

The others were good but some like Marianna Seligman were just okay. At times she seemed embarrassing but Victoria overcomes the others and keeps the film a head above.\n\nThis film has been playing around Buenos Ares in a bad copy so I would very much like to watch with a good copy.

Even in his comedic rap lyrics he has always given off an angry vibe; this was the perfect vehicle to express that rage. He was genuinely scary and I haven&apos;t thought that of a character in a long time. Berenger held his own in the role of a washed up semi-x-junkie lawyer, but because the character wasn&apos;t that interesting the actor didn&apos;t have much to work with; other notable (supporting) performances where Richard Allen as &quot;Sticky Fingaz&quot; and Frankie Faison as Judge Green.",

      "description": "Steven Luisi (Tom Berenger), a once prominent criminal defense attorney is attempting to come back to the profession after a struggle with drug addiction and a family tragedy. Steven stumbles into a complex, high profile murder case. Against his better judgment, he takes on the case that will eventually lead him down a path that brings him face to face with his own demons. While trying to solve the case Steven teams up with an ex-athlete turned gang member, Richard &quot;Beanz&quot; Allen. The two develop a fast friendship. Together they seek to reveal the truth and bring about justice in the court and on the street. Steven and Allen go head to head with the murderous Bowen (Busta Rhymes), a vicious Gang leader and Steven&apos;s old drug dealer. With Allen&apos;s help, Steven discovers that there are deep connections between Bowen, himself, and a corrupt police department. Throughout his journey, Steven learns more about the truth, and about himself. Allen and Steven discover that their common mission is the pursuit of redemption.",

It&apos;s supposed to be called &apos;Blood Money,&apos; but it sounds so much like Butt Money (was the singer holding his tongue?) that it&apos;s best if you refer to it as that. Butt Money...YEAAAAHHH!!\n\nCheaply produced music aside, the movie also suffers from not knowing what it is.  It takes place on New Botany Bay, a planet of deserts (?) with a very familiar Southern California like landscape where prisoners are held and supposedly mine materials as part of their punishment.  Also sentenced here is Richard Farnsworth, walking his way to a paycheck as some LAPD officer whose own stupidity lead to him being hit by a knife in some weird dream sequence.  Called into action by...um...somebody, he dresses up in his old duds to dish out old fashioned justice.  In a planet wide prison inexplicably called New Botany Bay that has only five guards and a couple of dune buggys.\n\nSpecial notice to all the bad special effects, which include:\n\n--prisoners obviously pretending to fire guns which are just toys with no muzzle flare or smoke,\n\n--stunt doubles that, when hit by Farnsworth, do a flip in the air before turning into dummies who hit the ground and freeze all motion on the film,\n\n--General confusion when they hit the &apos;industrial&apos; area of this prison planet and the conveniently located roadside diner (?!) on this prison planet.\n\nBottom line:  a very obvious attempt at something that went wrong.  This is a prime example of something going very very wrong.  This is the product of people with no talent, I&apos;m sorry to say."

      "reviewBody": "Take WarGames, dial down the intelligence level by 99%, add a bunch of dumb teens and some incredibly cheesy action sequences and what have you got? Do you need me to tell you?\n\nYou know the scenario.. three guys and three gals hack into a terrorist computer network which they think is a game but is instead a real life program. They order the assassination of the Russian peace envoy, explode a few oil refineries and generally wreck mayhem all over the good ol&apos; US of A. Only when they order their own deaths as a joke do they realise this is all actually happening in real life. Who can save them? Why, only a bearded border control guard and his bubbly news anchor girlfriend. Then, you have the hard-as-nails black guy and the obese White House security officer. (NEVER accuse the writers of sticking to convention!!)\n\nObviously, the fat dude is the only one to actually get shot in the film.. big target you see. The rest of the action involves lots of blanks being sprayed randomly about, tons of extras diving onto the ground in slow motion and explosions where the sound effects seem out of proportion to the minor blasts we see. There&apos;s some hand to-hand combat too, which wouldn&apos;t look out of place in a comedy satire. Meanwhile the computer nerds take it in turns to unwittingly plot the destruction of the free world on their PC, and shag the attractive ladies they bought along with them for the ride.\n\nSee, it&apos;s films like this that give spotty anti-social freaks who play Warcraft all day long a vain hope they may have a hope of losing their virginity. Sorry, not gonna happen. Despite six kids causing the deaths of thousands by ordering a hitherto unknown band of radicals to commit acts of terrorism over their PC, and supermen who can kill people by the dozen without taking so much as a scratch themselves, this is by far the most ludicrous plot in the movie.\n\nStill, it&apos;s not entirely without merit. The script is so hair-brained in will almost certainly keep you engrossed till the end, and it&apos;s always worth having a giggle at the many overdone battles. But at the end of the day, this amounts to very little but a waste of time and energy. Don&apos;t hold your breath for the DVD release. *GASP* 4/10\n\nP.S There is a &apos;funny&apos; monologue by one of the main characters over the ending credits which is possibly the most UNhilarious things I&apos;ve ever heard in my life. Plus an extra scene which would suggest a sequel. Except it never made it past the drawing board. Phew!",

I&apos;ve always enjoyed this film since its&apos; release. It is a good solid monster flick with some gore and a little mythology to boot. The creature effects are even to this day some of the darkest and twisted ever seen. The directing and look of the film are solid. Translating Clive Barker&apos;s imagination is probably very hardeven by Barker himself. The acting of the leads is very good and Cronenberg (a director in his own right) is sedate and creepy. If Hopkins wasn&apos;t available to play Hannibal the cannibal I would have chose him. The main detractor is the way the studio hacked up the original cut. And poor marketing didn&apos;t help either. Please release a director&apos;s cut someone. 7/10"

Just a little bit funny here are Jess Hahn and Francis Blanche. The whole movie is a long, long talk inside a castle. Indeed, there are some fights and shootings too, but they all look exactly the same. And there are some more similar scenes on a train."

It reveals the impact of the problem. It makes use of outstanding performances: Nicholson and Keitel are as cool as ever. Pellerine is the American woman. Her friends are that, too. The mafia ring consisting of policemen and coyotes is shown realistically. Violence is explicit but not overdone. Landscape and Latino immigrants are depicted in all their shades and lights. The strong American individual wins in the end - again. The good side beats the bad side. The Ry Cooder soundtrack is more than worth listening to. It is authentically reconstructed as always. Teachers: Pick up that video or DVD and use the movie for your lessons on the US Latino problem!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Olsen-banden ser rødt&quot; is a Danish film from 1976 directed by Erik Balling and written by Henning Bahs. Although the film is the eighth in the Olsenbanden series, it is still the best-selling Danish film in recent history with 1.2 million tickets sold. The plot revolves around Egon Olsen and his gang who are planning to steal a valuable Chinese vase worth 1.5 million kroner. However, they soon find out that they have been duped into stealing a copy of the vase. The gang must then break into a theater to steal the original vase from a Dutch buyer. The final scene, where the gang breaks through the walls of the theater to the sound of Friedrich Kuhlaus&apos;s ouverture from Elverhøj, is truly fantastic.\n\nAs a non-Danish viewer, I found &quot;Olsen-banden ser rødt&quot; hard to love because the characters seemed like caricatures, and I couldn&apos;t relate to them. However, the final scene of the movie was absolutely transcendent. The tension and excitement built up to a fantastic climax as the gang broke through the walls of the theater to the beautiful sound of Friedrich Kuhlaus&apos;s ouverture from Elverhøj. The music was so perfect and well-timed, and it really added to the excitement of the scene. Overall, while &quot;Olsen-banden ser rødt&quot; may not be the easiest film for non-Danes to enjoy, the final scene alone is worth watching the entire movie.",

Yet he doesn&apos;t dwell on sentimentality but only skims it, instead peppering the scenes with the bravura and faux assertiveness of adolescents. Malle and the actors adroitly juggle circumstances and emotions. Ultimately, they capture a terrifying time in history through the eyes and uncertainty of boys who aren&apos;t as grown-up as they&apos;d like to think.\n\nThe two main characters, Julien Quentin and Jean Bonnet, are beautifully portrayed by two very capable and talented young actors. The supporting cast is equally impressive. The film is directed with a touch of genius, and holds its own when compared to another motion picture masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird.",

The comments here are positive, almost everyone is praying The Squad, but how many remember what the purpose of it really is? Enough with finding excuses for horror, &quot;it doesn&apos;t act like one but it is so different&quot;, &quot;such a bold approach&quot;, &quot;new and original!&quot;, are nothing more that signs that you may want to stay away from this. After you watch it, you can barely put it in the horror section, only cause the plot offers 2 small clues, one coming very obviously at the end and one at start.\n\nAnyway, sorry to say, but I&apos;m disappointed, cause I came for a duck, it looked like a duck, did not act like one, did not sound like one, so stop telling me this is a duck. Get a pair of glasses and problem solved!\n\nI recommend Outcast or Dog Soldiers.!\n\nCheers!",

You do?-the perfect movie for you...a named Diana Willings (Camilla Belle) is supposedly having social troubles (but is really a daughter of the Indigo or an Indigo Child.-&gt;a person who has abilities connected to God) and able to see visions to help the folk of Jucaitambo. She travels to Jucaitambo with her Father to find the golden disc of Huascar (an Inca ruler who was believed to have ancient and spiritual powers.) While there, Diana is sitting on her bed playing gameboy, when this handsome stranger with long, dark hair, tanned skin and angelic face turns up in her window and watches her. She quickly notices him and says, &quot;Hi,&quot; silently. She walks over to the window and realizes that he is a boy of seventeen who begins to like her. His name is Lucho (Leandro Lopez from Hola Papi in 1995.) He takes her to the good sorcerer and spiritual man of the vilage, Don Benito (Roshan Seth) or the Hombre Grande (in Spanish meaning the man with great powers) he helps her find the disc for her Father and on the adventure to find it, Diana, Lucho, Don Benito (who secretly disappears into the morning sun as a condor) and Lucho&apos;s friend, Sancho, (Rodrigo Barrena) all see a new side of life. They all silently come to realize that there is more beyond the sky than &quot;azul&quot;. There is God...he watches over us and protects us, like the graceful mountain condor in the dusty mountain atmosphere.",

This movie finally won over the others I considered when I realized that a favorite is something personal and beyond reproach - you may hate this movie, but I saw at the perfect time of my life and now it means much more to me than it probably could otherwise.\n\nHenry Fonda turns in an excellent performance, which is testimony to his work ethic - he vocally denounced the script as &quot;corny&quot; enough to throw back Hollywood film-making 20 years.  The children are troopers of the same era as other classic family movies, ala Disney&apos;s &quot;Swiss Family Robinson.&quot;  I imagine the casting companies used were the same.\n\nThis movie accomplishes what it sets out to do - make you care about the Spencer family, their desire for respect and honor, and the sacrifices they make to do what they think is right.  There are many moments in this movie where you could be moved to tears.\n\nAn emotional movie with, dare I say it, a lot of heart.  It is my favorite movie.",

I enjoyed it but couldn&apos;t stop thinking that it needed a bit more editing.\n\nMaybe it follows the path of the hurt locker, in that it shows a certain place in a certain time, more than tell a traditional story, this can be good. However, it sometimes feels as if the director loves to linger on long contemplative shots (mostly well framed, but just too long), and kills the flow that the viewer tries to get.\n\nI didn&apos;t get much flow, personally. Of course this is a subjective matter. In the words of the director, this responds to the flow you feel in &quot;La Barra&quot; , the place where it takes place, that is very much real. He also says most of the actors are real people, doing basically what they do in real life... So I thought, agreeing with a friend, that maybe a documentary was more of a solution.\n\nThe Natural actors did fine, the little girl I think being the best, but I wonder if working with many real-life natural &quot;actors&quot; works sometimes against writing and putting a better script and movie together.",

      "reviewBody": "Before the Mitchell Brothers made what is probably their masterpiece with 1973&apos;s &apos;The Resurrection of Eve&apos;, they made this film. Behind the Green Door is a strange and surreal porn flick that features everything you&apos;d expect (and more!) in a weird dream-like setting. The film is cited by some to be an influence on Stanley Kubrick&apos;s final film Eyes Wide Shut - and it&apos;s certainly very obvious why. The plot focuses on the idea of a young girl being kidnapped. She is taken to a strange underground club, where the clients wear elaborate masks and costumes, and forced to perform various sex acts on stage. As a porn film; Behind the Green Door is likely to be a bit too strange for some, and as a film - there&apos;s far too little going on in the plot departments and despite the setting, it soon degenerates into a simple collection of porn sequences. It is very well filmed, however, and while we&apos;re seeing things like blow jobs and lesbian sex that we&apos;ve all seen in many other films; the Mitchell Brothers somehow manage to make it seem different to what we&apos;ve seen before due to the execution. I can&apos;t say that the film works as a complete whole - I didn&apos;t find it very erotic and there&apos;s really not a great deal going on outside of the many sex scenes. Still, this is undoubtedly an interesting film and followers of XXX stuff will likely want to track it down.",

      "reviewBody": "We&apos;ve all heard the expression &quot;if looks could kill,&quot; but how about thoughts? What if it were possible to kill somebody, no matter the distance, using the power of the mind to manipulate objects. Well, that is precisely the setup of Ray Danton&apos;s 1975 horror outing &quot;Psychic Killer,&quot; an undeniably shlocky yet undeniably fun exercise in out-of-body homicide. In the film, we meet a 33-year-old mental patient named Arnold Masters (Jim Hutton, father of Timothy, 42 here in his final film), who repeatedly declares his innocence of the charge of murdering his dying mother&apos;s doctor (his mother had had no health insurance, and so that doctor had refused to perform a lifesaving operation on her; a situation that resonates even more strongly today, 36 years later!). Masters&apos; luck soon takes a decided turn for the better, however, when his innocence is established, a fellow inmate gifts him with a voodoolike amulet, and he is released from confinement. Too bad, though, for all the folks who crossed Masters in the past, as the amulet soon confers on him the ability to slay from afar. As the film&apos;s trailer proclaimed back when, &quot;The Evil of the Future Has Arrived&quot;....\n\n&quot;Psychic Killer&quot; has a rather simple, straightforward story line, but to the film&apos;s credit, it also boasts a cast of pros who seem to be having fun with it. As the investigating cops on the case, we have TV vet Paul Burke and Aldo Ray (not quite 50 here but looking much older). Masters&apos; therapist (and God knows he needs one; the poor guy has almost as many mother issues as Norman Bates!) is played by Danton&apos;s then-wife, Julie Adams, who viewers will perhaps best remember as the bathing-suited beauty who is carried off in &quot;The Creature From the Black Lagoon,&quot; and Israeli-born Nehemiah Persoff chews the scenery winningly as an expert on parapsychology and Kirlian auras. As for Arnold&apos;s victims, three of the unfortunate bunch are Whit Bissell, here nudging toward the end of his remarkably prolific career, Mary Wilcox, who had recently greatly impressed me playing the beautiful necrophiliac in the highly underrated film &quot;Love Me Deadly,&quot; and Neville Brand, as a butchered butcher. It is a pleasure to watch these old pros dig into this dubious material and help put the conceit over. As for former actor turned director Danton, he does just fine in this, his third film (his two earlier pictures were &quot;Crypt of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;Deathmaster&quot;), giving &quot;Psychic Killer&quot; some nice jolts and really keeping things moving; still, the picture cannot help but give off a decided Kirlian aura of cheese. The film is hardly a sleek-looking affair, and seems at times a bit crudely put together, but again, the enthusiasm of the cast, Danton&apos;s evident skill and William Kraft&apos;s occasionally freaky-deaky background score help smooth over the rough patches. Really, my only beef here is with that car that topples over a cliff, falls hundreds of feet...and fails to give the viewer a nice, satisfying fireball explosion to cap things off. Danton, apparently, should have watched some &apos;60s Bond films to learn how to give such scenes a nice dramatic topper! Other than this quibble, though, my seal of approval to &quot;Psychic Killer&quot;...straight through to its incinerating conclusion."

      "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this movie. I&apos;m a big fan of film, but more than that, I&apos;m a fan of actors. Strong acting, as far as I&apos;m concerned, can redeem even the worst of movies (under the right circumstances) - and it&apos;s wonderful when the film itself is already good. \n\nSuch is the case with Stormy Monday, the directorial debut of Mike Figgis (who would later have great success with Leaving Las Vegas). The casting seems somewhat unusual, but in the end is quite effective. I have never been a big fan of either Melanie Griffith or Sting, and by contrast, have always enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Bean, so I was unsure of what to expect. But all four impressed me greatly with their performances. This is a film which requires the use of one&apos;s senses - we see the hopeful expressions on Griffith&apos;s and Bean&apos;s faces when they meet for the first time; we hear the frustration in the voice of Jones&apos; crooked businessman when he can&apos;t seem to get his way, and the resolve in the voice of Sting&apos;s jazz club owner when he refuses to give in to Jones. \n\nThe cinematography (by the excellent Roger Deakins) is classic film noir, and when combined with the wonderful jazz soundtrack, creates a moody atmosphere not often seen in 80&apos;s cinema. Overall, this is a success - dark, atmospheric, and absorbing, an actor&apos;s showcase and a film enthusiast&apos;s smorgasbord. There should be more like this one!",

The story is about a young Russian (Imperial Russia) officer is sent to the far east of Siberia to explore. He meets with a native of the region and they form a bond together. The territory in question is the wild, rugged eastern Siberia (north of Valdivostok). I would say that you have not lived until you have seen what Kurosawa can do filming nature in its raw splendor and magnificence. The scenes in this film like the wind rushing through the tall reeds, or the mist draping the forested hills, are images of haunting beauty.\n\nKurosawa, one of the greatest film directors of the 20th century, made his final masterpiece with film. The characters are well drawn, the sub-text of the story (the clash of civilization vs. nature) is nuanced, but most of all it is the wild beauty of nature which is the focus of this film. Once you see it, I don&apos;t think you will forget it, I know I never have.",

      "name": "Low budget Horror filmmakers accidently re-animate a real corpse and open a dimension of other zombies.",
      "reviewBody": "Okay, so those of us that love Horror movies: we understand that even the best directors and screenwriters are influenced by the Greats - Fulci, Argento, Carpenter, Savini.  What we also understand is that a great Horror movie is more than the sum of it&apos;s parts.  It&apos;s more than in-jokes and snappy lines and `homages&apos; to the above mentioned Greats.\n\nThese reasons are exactly why this movie doesn&apos;t work.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is a movie in a movie - because *that&apos;s* never been done before.  A group of film-makers attempt to make a zombie movie in an abandoned hospital.  Along the way they find an actual corpse, and because every film student knows that using an actual corpse as well as and breaking and entering make for excellent movies, they incorporate it into their film. Because there isn&apos;t a brain among them, and somehow the director convinces them that this is what dedicated filmmakers do, they accidentally re-animate the corpse and open a portal to a `zombie&apos; dimension.  People die, lots of blood and cranberry sauce gets spilled, and the movie ends without any real resolution.\n\nSomehow, the director/screenwriter, Dave Parker, thought that horror fans would appreciate the absolute littering of obscure names of people in the industry and the constant barrage of scenes ripped off from other movies would make us happy.  He got it into his head that we would enjoy watching re-hashed scenes and brain-numbing dialogue.  Yes, Dave, I like watching characters doing stupid things because I, like you, have nothing better to do than sit in my mother&apos;s basements watching reel after reel of crappy horror movies before dashing off to our jobs at the local video store.  Here&apos;s a thought, Dave - Horror fans want a movie that&apos;s scary, original - and dare I say it - fun!  Not some asinine piece of crap jigged together from movies that we haven&apos;t seen in 20 years.\n\nThen, because furthering torturing myself seemed like a good idea at the time, I watched the movie again with the commentary track, thinking that I would get some insight into why someone would waste perfectly good film on something like this, and instead I get what amounts to a circle jerk of the stars and the director patting each other on the back.\n\nPardon me for being harsh.\n\nWhat I discovered, to my true horror, was that the director intentionally set out to make a horror movie that was bad, and assumed that his savvy audience would appreciate the cheesy lines and nods to the people he was ripping off.  There were so many nods, his head was blur.\n\nI generally like movies produced by Full Moon Pictures.  After all, they gave us such tongue in cheek gems as PUPPET MASTER, DOLLMAN VERSES DEMONIC TOYS, the beautifully haunting MERIDAN, and my all-time favorite, PIT AND THE PENDULUM, starring Lance Henrikson.  There is a difference between an original movie that&apos;s corny and fun and a movie that can&apos;t distinguish between `homage&apos; and pure cat yak.\n\nWatching this movie is the equivalent to digging out your own eyes with a dirty spoon."

Rebecca de Mornay is the evil nanny who plots her revenge with relish, her satisfaction obvious as her plans begin to bear fruit. The nanny is not swayed by the innocence of the young girl or the newborn baby she is hired to care for and intends to destroy the entire family. Naturally, the parents are clueless as to what is going on until much later, while de Mornay methodically turns the household into her own domain, holding it in a grip of fear. Annabella Sciorra is the wife and mother who confronts de Mornay in the final moments. Graeme Revell contributes a nice music score.",

      "reviewBody": "Between the beginnings of the Swiss feature length movies in the 30ies and the middle of the 50ies, the cinematographic landscape was practically ruled by three directors alone: Franz Schnyder, Leopold Lindtberg, and Hermann Haller. While the latter had been mostly classified as &quot;artistic collaborator&quot;, &quot;assistant director&quot; or even only &quot;cutter&quot;, especially Schnyder&apos;s movies were famous and infamous at the same time for the strong propagandistic style. While this is true for most of Schnyder&apos;s later works, the often heard criticism at &quot;Gilberte De Courgenay&quot; is not just. First, one is astonished to hear the sentence given in the title out of the mouth of Kanonier Hasler (&quot;The war that YOU (i.e. the old generation) have started&quot;), then, generally, what we see about the discipline of the Swiss army is anything else than great: Besides the parade towards the end, brought up to give Mr. Odermatt the chance to change his opinion about the discipline in the army, we see the soldiers almost exclusively drinking in the railway-station restaurant in Courgenay. Although they are in charge, Hasler says in one episode that in the morning, he drank a whole bottle of schnapps. The only time when the soldiers are shown out in the field, they are served tea with cognac by Tilly. So what the basic purpose of this movie nowadays is, is to serve as a collection of all those nice and funny little episodes that ancient military colleagues use to tell one another to the hundredth time, when sitting in the restaurants and glorifying the &quot;good old times&quot;. If one is able to look away from this so-called Froentler-Mentality, one should let this film live (it is shown once a year by the Swiss National TV) and enjoy to meet again all those great actors who dominated the Swiss film scene during decades, such as Anne-Marie Blanc, Erwin Kohlund, Zarli Carigiet, Heinrich Gretler, Schaggi Streuli, Max Knapp, Rudolf Bernhard ... .",

Try not to take it as anything more than that and you should like it.\n\nThe acting is pretty bad but we can&apos;t really expect much, I suppose. However, Robert Englund was pretty good. The story is an interesting idea but I think it takes too long to get going, about a full hour and then we&apos;re left with about 15 minutes of actual action. Normally I like slow moving films but not when I&apos;m promised a &quot;fun&quot; movie.",

The plot, written by Neil Simon is brilliantly fast-paced, the comedy lies everywhere, and there&apos;s terrific support from Maurice Denham, Britt Ekland, and of course Victor Mature sending up himself as a age-defying crummy actor. Why it flopped, heaven knows. Under the masterful direction of Vittorio de Sica, this map-cap farce makes great viewing, although it does take a bit to get the momentum up. Overall, very enjoyable.",

      "reviewBody": "Having heard the book was an unbridled attack on Clinton, I was afraid this film would be the same, but it wasn&apos;t. &quot;Primary Colors&quot; was definitely better than I thought it would be.\n\nFirst, there was Elaine May&apos;s script: Funny, well-written, lean, tender at moments, never taking things to the camp level, like so many modern Hollywood movies do when it doesn&apos;t work. And it wouldn&apos;t have worked for this movie. The thing that kept me watching was that, like Henry, I *did* believe in Jack Stanton, or at least I wanted to. The tender moments, like those at the beginning in the literacy class, kind of endeared me to the Stanton character and made me understand how Burton was drawn in so irrevocably.\n\nThen, there was the acting: marvelous. Travolta, Thompson, Bates: need I say more? Thompson&apos;s underlying, clipped accent adds a brittle note to her delivery that fits right in with Susan&apos;s repression and humiliation. Travolta was just nice enough to make you believe in him (although, in my opinion, he was ultimately unable to fully portray that &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; that Clinton possesses, which makes him so charming to many). Bates was riveting and harrowing as the faded liberal clinging to her ideals.\n\nBut in addition to the &quot;name actors&quot; there were others who were fantastic: Adrian Lester, as the tortured campaign aide, wants to believe but feels unsure of Stanton&apos;s worth as a candidate. Maura Tierney (best known as the wife in &quot;Liar Liar&quot;) as the bubbling, funny sidekick to Lester (probably based on Dee Dee Myers), lights up every scene she&apos;s in. Larry Hagman, in a wonderful cameo, plays Stanton&apos;s opponent and his foil in the morals department.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton plays the James Carville role, and I wasn&apos;t sure what he added to the film. Since I constantly compared his character unfavorably to James Carville (the Thornton character was shown as a real rotter, sexually harassing aides, etc.), I&apos;m not sure if my dislike of Thornton was more my dislike of his character than that of his acting.\n\nThe production of this film also added to its wonderful feel: the Governour&apos;s Mansion, the local ribs place, the constant red/white/blue theme (sometimes it seemed like a Kieslowski film), all of it added to the ambiance. I was not surprised to learn that the Michael Ballhaus, the cinematographer, also filmed the sumptuous &quot;Age of Innocence.&quot; Quality tells.\n\nMike Nichols&apos;s directing was also effective: in one especially harrowing scene, Emma Thompson&apos;s tormented face fills up the foreground, while Bates&apos;s character (in the background) rips into the Stantons&apos; morals. I almost felt like I was at the theater.\n\nThis film made me think about Clinton as well as politicians in general. What is admirable, what is not acceptable, what is it we really *want* in our public officials? I don&apos;t think &quot;Primary Colors&quot; will change anyone&apos;s opinion of the Clintons (in the final analysis, it isn&apos;t about them at all) -- but it is a very funny as well as thought-provoking look at modern American politics."

In fact, I would have liked another 15 minutes in the movie to bring out those relationships even more.  I would have liked a little more elaboration on what happened in the past between James Spader and Keanu Reeves.  Also, I wish the movie had shown part of the session between the Psychologist, played by Marisa Tomei, and the serial killer, played by Keanu Reeves.  Marisa Tomei&apos;s facial reaction to Keanu Reeves&apos; comment prior to the session was perfect.  &quot;Do clients come to see you because you are good or because you are very pretty.&quot;  (Line by Reeves to Tomei - maybe not verbatum) \n\nKeanu Reeves plays David Griffin very well. This is another example showing how Keanu Reeves can take any character and make it both believable and likeable to some extent. Both Reeves and Spader display the need for each other by the end of the film. Yes, I did detect at least a professional need by Spader for Reeves in the Watcher.  So did Marisa Tomei I think. This movie had both a good balance of a crime drama, with the police and car chase scenes, and strong character development.  My only complaint is like others have said on this board, I felt it was rushed.",

Instead he has four beautiful women delivering their &quot;services&quot; to male and female customers willing to pay. This includes a sweet young woman (Desiree Cousteau) from Alabama.\n\nHOT &amp; SAUCY PIZZA GIRLS is one of the classic titles from the era when the porn genre was taken more serious than it is today. You know, back before the VHS boom and certainly way before the day and age of internet where anyone can record something on their cell phone and post it. This film here certainly isn&apos;t in the same league as certain masterpieces in the genre but it&apos;s got a rather fun and unique tale and certainly plenty of sex with some hot ladies.\n\nThe most familiar name is the cast is obviously Holmes who not only gets several sex scenes but also gets to &quot;act&quot; some. The early scenes of him telling the girls what they&apos;re delivering, creatively using various pizza toppings, is actually handled well by the actor with a little comic timing. Cousteau is best remembered for PRETTY PEACHES but she&apos;s also fun to watch here and uses that same silly nature to add the charm."

It&apos;s one of those films that is incidentally seen by the casual channel surfer and, given five minutes, impossible to turn away from.  This film is amazingly innovative in its premise and relies on character, (New York being as important as any other), and story to set the flow and tempo.  There are deliciously cunning and unique character moments throughout a film that is, at the same time, full of contrivance and stereotypical sorts.  (Do we really need to see another Irish-american policeman being negligent in his duties?).  Yet, somehow all the parts equal a very solid whole and a very tense, sharply focussed and surprising film.\n\nIf you see this one on late-night tv as you flick through with your remote, be sure to stop and take a look.  This one is a definite &quot;yes&quot;.",

First of all its not a movie that pushes religion in any way though religion does fit into the theme. While religion is what this movie is based off, its still very interesting and kind of a trip.\n\nTo me it was the 1970&apos;s grindhouse style that got me. Im a sucker for and exploitation file, and that is exactly what this is.\n\nI give it 8 stars because I can see there is some kind of closed mindedness going on with this film. I encourage you not to make this a religious debate and just enjoy the movie for what it is, A Grindhouse 1970&apos;s style exploitation film that was independently made.",

Their separate paths will eventually cross, but will it be on the road to salvation or the highway to hell?\r\n\r\nSATAN HATES YOU boasts a supporting cast of well-known genre stars including Angus Scrimm (PHANTASM, TV&apos;s ALIAS), Reggie Bannister (PHANTASM, BUBBA HO-TEP), Michael Berryman (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO&apos;S NEST, THE HILLS HAVE EYES), Debbie Rochon (TROMEO AND JULIET, TERROR FIRMER) and Larry Fessenden (HABIT, THE BRAVE ONE) with appearances by Pauley Perrette (TV&apos;s NCIS, ALMOST FAMOUS), John Levene (TV&apos;s DOCTOR WHO) and author Max Brooks (WORLD WAR Z, THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE).\r\n\r\nSATAN HATES YOU is intended for adults and mature teens.

The place is seductive and the guide would not be just anyone. Chris Marker had been there two years before but Varda is second to none in my book. \n\nAgnes is reflecting on her own right here. It&apos;s not meant to be a chronicle of anything, much less paean of revolution, but a sketchbook of impressions, glimpses on the road. She had been there and came back with still images which she edits in a playful way. The revolution does loom central of course, in the campaigns to literate peasants and the collective dances of gathering sugarcane, the frescoes and images of heroes, but seen through Varda&apos;s eyes, Cuba is a place that above all sways in rhythms and music that well up from inside of it, from generosity of heart. It is collective joy that Varda graces us with and salutes.\n\nIt&apos;s in the music, the religious dances and masks, the sugarcane work, the women&apos;s bodies, such evocative women that even Varda pauses to admire. It&apos;s no less in the gallery of gruesome photos from the war, exhibits of pride. Another segment admires soldiers on horseback as movie figures from westerns, ironically admiring the capacity of image to support our own imprints of meaning, able to bridge odd divides. Fidel as the Gary Cooper of the revolution, the narrator muses.\n\nIt all turns around form, image, dances of recollection from these, the transient and impromptu. It all points to how the image is pliant, a field where memories and narratives intersect. Some of these she has just improvised for us.\n\nI don&apos;t leave feeling like I&apos;m much the wiser about Cuba or revolution, which is okay, I&apos;m fine without being wise in that sense. I leave feeling like I have briefly swayed in the breeze of being able to touch without smudging, partake without taking, know without knowing. More important this."

Read history to find out what the &quot;Human&quot; thing to do is when people invade your country, it&apos;s alot bloodier than the Hippy vision of a communist society where everyone gets along and all cultures disappear and we have only 1 people left in the world to sell McDonalds to. That is the future this movie tries too sell and ignores the fact that &quot;Diversity&quot; in the world s allowing people to exist in their own country. When I travel to Italy I want to be greated by Italians, Africa, Africans, America, Americans, etc etc. This new vision of &quot;diversity&quot; is nothing but every race/creed/culture lumped together in one country to the point that there IS no diversity and we all become 1 indistinct race that the News and Big Business can sell their products too easier because we&apos;ve become 1 demographic. No thank you that is not human that is the opposite of human that is turning humanity into a herd of sheep and is NOT a future that I look forward to or would in any way condone.",

      "reviewBody": "In the course of four weeks (June 9 until July 9, 2006) Germany was nothing but a huge party. Celebrating the fantastic achievements of our national soccer team.\n\nSönke Wortmann, the director of this documentation, accompanied the team during this time. &quot;Deutschland - Ein Sommermärchen&quot; gives us a glance behind the curtain.\n\nThe beginning is at the same time the most tragical moment. The defeat against Italy along with the grieving players and coaches.\n\nAfterwards the movie chronologically goes the way from the training camp until the semi - final. We are able to see the players in their training sessions, tactical discussions among the coaching staff, and lots of fooling around from the young players like Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski. We can see that a team was growing. We can see the intense sense of community and solidarity among them.\n\nThe documentation doesn&apos;t focus on the soccer scenes alone. However, it doesn&apos;t neglect them. We see the goals again, the enthusiastic fans, the hilarious atmosphere which infected the whole country.\n\nI&apos;m glad we also see a lot of what happened apart from the football ground. It&apos;s interesting to see what happened in the dressing room while we (the fans watching on TV) were fetching another drink or going to the toilet or whatever we did during the breaks.\n\nAltogether I can recommend this documentation to everyone who had fun in the great summer 2006. And I recommend it to everyone who considers the Germans to be some non-smiling accurate work-robots.\n\nIt was a unique experience. A whole nation was backing up its soccer team. National flags were waving from every car, every house. It was, as if Germany had completely changed over night. That&apos;s why we call it a summer fairy-tale - &quot;Ein Sommermärchen&quot;.",

Not every person in the world thinks the way American people do, so be open to possibilities.\n\nI saw it yesterday and I was overwhelmed with the beauty in the narrative of the story. The director had a very unique way of making you feel what he wanted you to feel. Some things you may not understand if you don&apos;t have some historical background or if you don&apos;t know the meaning of Chinese symbols etc. Its quite good."

      "reviewBody": "Louis Theroux takes on a complicated topic--African game safaris. In many ways, it&apos;s obvious he finds these hunting reserves to be distasteful and perhaps wrong. But, on the other hand, the show does discuss the very positive benefits from such preserves. After all, if these private hunting parks didn&apos;t exist, many species of African animals would become extinct. Plus, while it&apos;s ugly seeing these animals die, their death is probably more human that the way that our farm animals are slaughtered. I appreciate how the lack of clarity is shown in the program and I think Louis summed it up when he said he would eat the meat but couldn&apos;t bring himself to kill one of the animals himself. Because of this, the show isn&apos;t one that looks to confirm either extreme--that killing these wild animals is GOOD or that hunting in general is EVIL. Well done, though I did agree with the final interview--Louis did often let his culture and emotion control the interview process. Thought-provoking.",

I thought this film was genuinely funny and I truly enjoyed it. The characters are all funny and are all likeable.\n\nThe acting is very good. Luke Wilson is by far the best. He is a likeable, funny, and good-hearted man looking for a fresh start. Vince Vaughn is also hilarious.  His one-liners are always well timed. Will Ferrell plays a weird and sometime socially awkward man who at times can be very funny. I found his character to be the weakest and at times he was really annoying. Jeremy Piven&apos;s character is not well developed and very, very annoying.\n\nThe pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong.\n\nPros: Hilarious story, good jokes, Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are both hilarious, and most the characters are likeable\n\nCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, Jeremy Piven and his bad performance, and Will Ferrell&apos;s character is a little annoying\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0",

      "reviewBody": "This comedy was a tiny little slow to start, but it turned out to be a funny, plaisant and moving moment to share with those excellent actors on the screen.\n\nMaurice lives with his single mom in a humble house and works on a farm and has a gift : his ability to communicate with animals. He is simple, honest and has a lot of integrity, although more &quot;sophisticated&quot; people living in the village enjoy mocking him.\n\nOne evening he &quot;borrows&quot; his employer&apos;s car to drive to a party where he and his hair stylist friend have committed to play the music and sing. And here comes trouble... The employer&apos;s brand new car is damaged by a drunk, racist Parisian yuppie lacking manners who drives away. Fortunately, the yuppie&apos;s Parisian girlfriend has left Maurice her business card.\n\nMaurice and his hairstylist friend decide to go to the capitale to get money from the Parisian crazy driver to fix the damaged car. That&apos;s when the movie starts cruising nicely, full of gags, misunderstandings and imbroglios around the Parisian couple, Maurice&apos;s employer&apos;s son, who happens to be a &quot;medical&quot; student taking drama classes, and youngster crossing their path.\n\nThe movie is about lifestyles (countryside vs urban), value systems (pursuing personal goals vs respecting others and solidarity) and generation conflicts (lack of real communication).\n\nLight, entertaining and healthy nutty evening. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Now, this was a true work of art. A quietly designed yet devastating story of a religious Medieval family and how their faith becomes challenged when their young daughter is brutally raped and murdered by three derelict brothers. Max von Sydow plays the father who is a God-fearing believer, yet finds himself overcome by his own sweet desire for revenge against those who wronged his little girl. I am happy to say I appreciated Ingmar Bergman&apos;s genius just by this movie alone. It&apos;s a visually beautiful piece to look at, but also with a story and strong convictions. So much is said without really needing to go overboard. I can see there is a recurring theme in his work where he questions the existence of God, or at least the complicated ways in which God works things out on Earth. I&apos;m not sure whether Bergman was a full-blooded atheist or not at this point but I&apos;d suspect he was at least a questioning agnostic. I&apos;m sure this is partly why Woody Allen is so enamored with the director, as a similar religious thread runs through some of Allen&apos;s own movies. For the record, I am a strong believer in God, though these days I too have been faced with personal issues which have had me having difficulties in understanding, much like the father of THE VIRGIN SPRING. So this movie also touches a personal nerve within me. The performances here are all first-rate, with a special nod to Birgitta Petterson as the friendly and generous young woman who we take an instant liking to, but becomes the victim. What more can I say? An exceptional and deeply-moving film. **** out of ****",

Take good note of the early dinghy racing scenes. I don&apos;t believe they used any trick photography: things really can happen that fast.\n\nOf course, there&apos;s a larger set of stories, the classic love stories: between men and women, of sailing, of ideas, of ideals; the rough retelling of the Dennis Connor story (though I place Robertson/Weld as Connor, not Modine/Parker); an accurate representation of the &quot;Old Boys&apos;&quot; network that *is* big-money yacht racing --I&apos;ve met &quot;Abigail Weld&quot; many times; and the &quot;absurdity&quot; of a desert-based effort winning the Cup, a nod to the Melges&apos; campaign.\n\nThe photography is astounding, the character development (the reason for the film&apos;s length) good, and the music complimented everything admirably.\n\nThat it&apos;s &quot;about&quot; sailing will turn many off, but those of us with a love of the sea and sailing hold this as a classic to be cherished.",

      "name": "Performances Outpace Story",
      "reviewBody": "In every actor&apos;s career there comes a moment where the critics and audiences rally around jumping for joy about how they&apos;ve just witnessed a breakthrough performance. As stunning as these performances are, the term &quot;breakthrough&quot; always felt a little out of place to me since it&apos;s only on rare occasions the actor in question is relatively new. Most times they are people who have been pounding the boards and scraping the screen for years. In those terms, the breakthrough is nothing more than a large group of people seeing that actor in a new light for the first time, mostly in something they never imagined before. Now the newly colored spotlight falls on Anne Hathaway and her powerful turn as Kym in Rachel&apos;s Getting Married.\n\nThe film is a slice of life piece detailing a small space of time, only a few days, where Kym returns home from a rehab clinic just in time for her sister Rachel&apos;s wedding. Anyone who has ever taken part in arranging a wedding, especially one taking place in the family home, knows the extreme stress already present, so toss a young, partially unstable girl into the mix and top it off with a nice coating of family denial and dark skeletons in the hallway closet, then you get the full picture of this film. Relationships are strained, ties pulled so tight and taut they could snap and still they try to work it out through screaming, laughing and crying (not necessarily in that order). After all, it&apos;s about a wedding, who&apos;s not happy at those? Before giving Anne her due credit, let me shed some light on someone most people won&apos;t know off the top of their heads. Rosemarie DeWitt plays the title role of Rachel and she does it with the utmost tenderness and subtlety. What she brings across is the inherent hatred, resentment and unending compassion sisters can feel for each other, even through the worst of storms. With a film more comfortable in the category of &quot;ensemble piece&quot;, Rosemarie is the catalyst and pushes the energy along, changing and charging every one of her scenes. But the light shines brightest on Anne Hathaway as Kym, the ex-junkie, ex-alcoholic, ex-return rehab patient bordering on becoming an ex-family member. Audiences claim this as a breakthrough performance because they fell in love with Anne in The Princess Diaries movies, Ella Enchanted and the wonderfully wicked The Devil Wears Prada. Yet what they might not remember is she&apos;s played rougher, tougher roles in Havoc and Brokeback Mountain, showing the more mature and adult side of her skills. So I wasn&apos;t all that shocked to witness the brilliance she brought to this film, but I will celebrate it all the same. Anne jumps in and exposes a vulnerability, a cavern of pain and lost love, which drives the emotional core of the picture. From opening credits to the closing moment, she is the elephant in the room everyone must deal with and the magical point is this is the first time where the audience can begin to empathize with the elephant and not the onlookers. I can&apos;t end the acting portion of this review without bringing up Bill Irwin and Debra Winger as well. Bill plays her father and churns out a tenderness only an accomplished actor such as himself could generate. There are such small moments, such tiny fractures in his facade which allow you to peer into the heart of a man trying to choose between his greatest love and his greatest loss. On the other side, Debra Winger plays her mother, who has chosen to block out the pain in her past and skate by the rest of her life, allowing the blackness and hurt to fester and suffocate any chance at a real connection with her daughters. As you can read, the acting on display here is sensational and will undoubtedly be remembered during awards season.\n\nAs a total film, I&apos;m not sure the story reaches the same heights. A lot of great scenes and spectacular moments are created, but the story lacks cohesion. A particular subplot about the family and its deep love for music is mentioned and referred to over and over, but never fully explained or explored, which weighs down later scenes during the wedding celebration and the overlong musical sequences. During most of the musical moments, all I really wanted was to get back to the story, back to the family and to Kym. Also, the connection between Rosemarie and her soon-to-be husband Sydney (played by Tunde Adebimpe) never quite comes across. There is a wonderful moment during their wedding vows, but it could have been helped even more if their relationship had been more centered earlier on.\n\nOn the directing front, Jonathan Demme, with the assistance of a touchingly tender script from Jenny Lumet, helps craft a reality we can all believe in, a home we can all feel we&apos;ve been to before. Much of this intimacy and nuance came from the free form style of camera movement, with the actors never knowing where and when the camera was going to appear on them. Everyone was basically playing everything from the moment he yelled action, so there were emotional surprises around every pan of the camera. That technique gave the movie a certain level of improv or even documentary feeling, like the audience was the most silent of voyeurs.\n\nRecommendation: A powerful series of moments, filled with terrific acting, that don&apos;t quite come together as a film. Certainly has great value to witness, but the theater experience might not be necessary. Also, this really is meant for those viewers not afraid to open themselves up to it.",

Cause some reason everybody wants to compare every movie to the godfather and gone with the wind. And i love the godfther but lets be real. This was made in 2006 and I&apos;m not sure if you can find another action movie that kept you on the edge of your seat 10 years after it.\n\nI can&apos;t think of any. And if I could the acting wouldn&apos;t be the same. One thing a lot of people forgot to mention in these reviews. You can watch this movie over and over. Heck I even forgot about the ending. And I&apos;ve seen this like 5 times already. And where a lot of action movies lack is they drift off and its either not too much action or they play out for the audience at the time. This movie brought it. Notice the female character fits no such stereotypes. Thats a win right there. Her character alone was part of the movie and added so much to it. \n\nYou can just in this movie and wonder what is going to happen. Who is going to get shot, if anybody will get busted. I was once again so impressed with the acting that even the kid who is the main character as well is great at acting. Seems like a natural. Even the ending was great. \n\nI must say I hear a lot of talk about fast and the furious. And Paul walker was great in those movies (may he rest in peace). But this movie never gets mentioned and I don&apos;t know why. The car as well was an attraction."

      "reviewBody": "The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like &quot;Raising Arizona &quot; and &quot;Fargo&quot;, one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It&apos;s as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and &apos;Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it&apos;s so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn&apos;t chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball&apos;s finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists&apos; feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!  One can not keep a straight face whilst watching.",

      "reviewBody": "I was a casual fan of Canadian headbangers Anvil during their brief early &apos;80s heyday. (Their signature song, &quot;Metal On Metal,&quot; features one of the most bad-ass opening guitar riffs in Metal history, in my humble opinion!) I became a full blown fanboy when I was lucky enough to see one of their few shows on American soil in the mid &apos;90s. It was in a small club in New Jersey (opening for a similarly ignored &apos;80s metal band, Raven) and they blew the roof off the joint. So I&apos;ve been in Anvil&apos;s corner for awhile now and therefore have been absolutely dyin&apos; to see this documentary, which is finally shining a spotlight on a forgotten band that deserved a much better hand than they were dealt.\n\n&quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot; opens in 1984, when Anvil played a huge rock festival in Japan alongside other up and coming, soon-to-be-megastars like the Scorpions, Bon Jovi and Whitesnake. Clips from this concert are spliced with present-day commentary from members of Heavy Metal royalty like Lars (Metallica) Ulrich, Scott (Anthrax) Ian, and Lemmy (Motorhead) Kilminster reminiscing about what a great band Anvil was in their prime. Everyone else on that bill went on to sell zillions of records, but Anvil quickly dropped off the musical radar after that brief blip of fame and all but disappeared. Two and a half decades later, most people probably thought the band had broken up a long time ago, if they remembered Anvil at all. However, the founding members (Steve &quot;Lips&quot; Kudlow, guitar/vocals and Robb Reiner, drums) have kept the band going, continuing to release albums and playing whatever gigs they can get, still doggedly keeping their eyes on a brass ring which seems permanently out of their reach. Are they insane? Possibly, but their determination and never-say-die road dog spirit becomes touching and inspiring very quickly. When we catch up with Lips and Reiner in the present day, they&apos;re back home in Canada, working dead-end jobs to pay the bills (Lips as a delivery truck driver for a caterer, Reiner in construction) and still dreaming of becoming rock stars. Their guitarist&apos;s girlfriend and amateur &quot;manager&quot; has lined up a European tour for the band that has the potential to become their most extensive road jaunt in nearly 20 years. The boys start off strong with a well attended set at the prestigious Sweden Rock Festival but the remainder of the tour is a disaster of Spinal Tap proportions, made up of barely promoted, sparsely attended gigs in small European rock bars and clubs where they are disrespected and rarely, if ever, paid. The climax of the tour, a &quot;rock festival&quot; in Romania, is held in a 10,000 seat arena in which only 174 paying customers show up. They return to Canada, broke and tired, but Lips continues to see the sunny side of things as they begin preparations to record their thirteenth album. The second half of the film shows the process of making that record while financial, family and personal pressures threaten to finally break up the Lips/Reiner duo once and for all.\n\n&quot;Spinal Tap&quot; comparisons are unavoidable when watching &quot;Anvil&quot; (The inept manager/girlfriend, amps that go to 11, the band even visits Stonehenge, for cryin&apos; out loud!), but this is not a Mockumentary. The film is funny at times, sad at others, and fascinating all the way through. I have to say that Kudlow, the leader of Anvil and the heart of this film, is an amazingly positive person. He has gone through so much crap over the years for the sake of his band yet he still believes that one day they&apos;re going to &quot;make it.&quot; (I personally would&apos;ve said &quot;to hell with it&quot; and shot up a Burger King long ago if I were in his shoes.) Reiner plays the mostly-silent Teller to Lips&apos; motormouthed Penn through most of this film, never saying much, but when the chips are down his devotion to his friend and their musical dreams comes through.\n\nHappily, the attention given to this film has seemingly turned the tide for Anvil. The band has gotten more press and played more gigs for more people in the last year than they probably have in the last decade, so their story is not yet over. &quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot; is a true underdog story. Even if you&apos;re not a metal fan, you&apos;ll find yourself drawn to this tale of two old time rockers who simply refuse to quit.",

Second: the story was a pretty original one, albeit the film managed to make it really confusing from start to finish, if a semi talented director would have gotten this story it could have made for a really decent movie. \n\nMy Advice To You: If your not a film student - STAY AWAY!",

Johnson, replacing Michael Pare from the 1984 flick, finds himself `shifted&apos; into an alternate 1993 - one in which Germany won World War II - when a power-mad scientist (Gerrit Graham) tinkers with the timeline by sending a stealth bomber back to the Germans circa 1943.\n\nAlthough it assumes you&apos;ve seen its predecessor, and plays sketchy several plot details, this is still a skillfully constructed, resourceful sci-fi adventure. I give it an 8."

This is a film with a simple plot, lots of laughs and has a strong feel good element. Martin Lawrence brings his unique brand of crude yet charming humor to the screen and Tim Robbins more than holds his own. This simple story has a number of twists, moments of comedic genius and a very satisfying end. \n\nYou don&apos;t always have huge expectations watching these type of films so you&apos;re pleasantly surprised and gained something from watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "The narrator explains how the rivalry between Buddha Fist practitioners and Lohan Fist became a political Ming versus Ching thing. The rebels plan to kill the Manchu prince when he visits the temple.\n\nAt the temple, Mang Hoi does his chores and gets bullied. His friend, the crazy old monk, Chin Yuet-Sang (see him in &quot;Kung Fu vs Yoga&quot;), is warned to make himself scarce during the visit. Hwang Jang-Lee, the prince, arrives and Mang Hoi saves his life by calling out &quot;Assassin!&quot;\n\nThe prince rewards him and he goes back to the temple as a big shot over those who bullied him previously. The prince asks for a kung fu demonstration. Then we go to a casino for some reason and Mang Hoi gets into a fight and crazy monk comes to his rescue. Crazy monk decides Mang Hoi needs to learn Lohan Fist to defeat the prince who wants to destroy Shaolin temple.\n\nAt about 35 minutes in there is a fabulous stunt off the balcony. I can imagine how filming this scene went. Corey Yuen says to the stunt men, &quot;I need a guy to jump off that balcony.&quot; Nobody volunteers. Corey says, &quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll put down some padding.&quot; One guy says, &quot;Okay, I&apos;ll do it.&quot; Corey says, &quot;Great, okay, the rest of you stunt men are the padding!&quot;\n\nMang Hoi is a very talented martial artist with strong acrobatic skills. Due to his short stature and baby face (I think he looks like a ten year old Biao Yuen) he was not leading man material. This is likely his biggest role. Nevertheless many other action directors appreciated his skills and he continues to be in movies until today. Also, as an action director, his list of 30 some credits doesn&apos;t have a stinker on it.\n\nThe copy is wide screen and good enough resolution for a modern television and has English dubbing by the A-team of voice overs. There are a few sections that are not dubbed for some reason. After watching this I start thinking &quot;lost classic&quot; and &quot;needs a high definition restoration&quot;. Dream on!. I rate it above average and recommend it for all.",

This is how bad it gets, the caverns look fake, the &quot;disasters&quot; are about as scary as a basket of bunnies, and the caverns are miraculously lighted by who knows what, even though they should be in total darkness. The only redeeming factor is a typical smarmy performance from Ray Milland, and Susan Sullivan is effective &quot;eye candy&quot; in tight slacks. One other thing, caves do not cave in, mines cave in. Perhaps this should be called &quot;Mine Cave-In&quot;? - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "Well, here&apos;s one Hammer movie that was rather difficult to come across! Especially in comparison to the British studio&apos;s classic horror, Sci-Fi and psychological thriller efforts, this mixture between historical drama and swashbuckler adventure (don&apos;t let the cover image or US title &quot;Night Creatures&quot; mislead you; it&apos;s not a horror film) is obscure and little seen. To my recollection it has never even been aired on the BBC, and that&apos;s where I personally watched a lot of Hammer horror movies from the sixties and seventies. I wonder why, because &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; is a solid and engaging film with a good script, fine performances and a handful of truly ingenious highlights. The story takes place around the end of the 18th Century in a small English coastal village named Dymchurch, and I must say it&apos;s a downright fantastic little place! Not only does the entire village participate in a giant smuggling network, they also have imaginative ways for transporting bootlegged liquor around town and all the villagers collectively help to mess around with an official delegation of soldiers sent by the British Crown to investigate! They even have an utmost brilliant signaling process with scarecrows in place and call upon sinister skeleton horsemen to scare off potential perpetrators! The charismatic leader of Dymchurch is Reverend Blyss, but serving God obviously isn&apos;t his primary mission in life. &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; is a fun watch, neatly written by Anthony Hinds and well-directed by the fairly unknown Peter Graham Scott. The cast is top-notch, with glorious roles for Peter Cushing (reliable as always), Oliver Reed (back when he still appeared on film sets in a sober state), Martin Benson (as the town&apos;s weakest link) and Michael Ripper (phenomenal as the local undertaker). There aren&apos;t many women in the cast, but the beautiful and curvy Yvonne Romain is astonishing enough to represent a whole army of women. Recommended!",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Fatal Move",
      "reviewBody": "Written and directed by Dennis Law, Fatal Move was originally conceived as the prequel/sequel to 2005&apos;s SPL, which had Donnie Yen and Simon Yam pit their skills on the side of the law against triad members played by Sammo Hung and Wu Jing. SPL had an interesting concept to begin with, but I guess with the ending as it was (a cop out in my opinion), a successful sequel with an interlocking storyline with the surviving characters would prove challenging. A prequel on the other hand might not be as engaging, as if we were to see the rise of Sammo&apos;s character to triad boss status, it would ring too much a bell with Infernal Affairs 2.\n\nSo Fatal Move offers a completely new storyline, albeit with most of the SPL main cast coming back for another go. Donnie Yen is absent (I&apos;ll see him in action later with The Empress and The Warriors), and Simon Yam crosses over the fence to star as the brother of Sammo&apos;s triad boss character Lin Ho Lung. However, Yam&apos;s Lin Ho Tung seems to be having a walk in the park (and in fact he really did!), as is Lin Ho Lung, because those itching to see some serious butt-kicking action by Sammo Hung, will have to wait until the last 10 minutes of the movie. There are plenty of Milkyway regulars here, with Lam Suet, Cheung Siu-Fai and Maggie Siu on hand to lend their heavyweight support to appeal to Westerners here who are familiar with their works, and Danny Lee returns after a long hiatus to play, what else, a cop yet again.\n\nThe storyline is nothing to wow over, and most times seemed to be running on a railway track, completely fixed and one-way, chugging along almost endlessly, without a destination in sight. Character motivations were unclear, and Tien Niu as Lung&apos;s wife Soso really let it all rip in a melodramatic monologue that contains a lot more story in her words than all the dialogue put together in the movie. It&apos;s about the self-destruction of a triad gang from internal strife from the greed of man, but its central theme was touched upon in a rather haphazard, messy manner that you&apos;d wonder if the sub-plots were just bookends for the action sequences.\n\nHowever, despite its title, Fatal Move is severely lacking in compelling action scenes. You have the tired car chases, and it seems that there was little effort in trying to milk what Wu Jing and Sammo Hung could do. They&apos;re martial arts exponents, but get to handle guns most of the time, and this does not exploit the skills they are trained with, which you can probably employ anyone to take over their place. Most of the fighting sequences were courtesy of Wu Jing, who&apos;s especially mean with his lopsided blue-dyed hairdo and an extremely sharp sword, but given no competent exponent character-wise to spar with him, it all boiled down to a one-sided affair. Seriously I&apos;m a fan of his and I think it&apos;s about high time he takes over the starring role mantle for Chinese action movie stars, instead of getting bogged down playing side show villains.\n\nWhat gets compensated for the uninspiring action sequences, was blood and gore done in CGI. I&apos;m placing my bets that Herman Yau, as director of photography here, would have added some of his own pointers in this aspect, and the camera does linger on in some of the more violent and gory aspects, such as pumping continuous lead into a body, and various forms of decapitations involving limbs and fingers, right down to a castration. The much touted fight between Sammo Hung and Wu Jing was the main draw for me I have to admit, but if you were to put SPL and this side by side, Wu Jing vs Donnie Yen had a lot more intensity and slick moves compared to Wu Jing vs Sammo Hung.\n\nBut alas despite the M18 rating here, the movie was still subjected to multiple edits (originally rated R21 uncut, but no thanks of course to money-making distributors), and most of the gory bits couldn&apos;t escape the censor&apos;s scissors. What made it unforgivable, was that the much awaited duel too became victim, and for that, with the insipid storyline and relatively generic action, I would have to recommend that this be skipped at the cinemas, and rent the DVD if you&apos;re really interested.",

It has Wallace Beery as a borderline madman scientist leading an expedition to a far off island to find dinosaurs. There is a subplot of a reporter who is trying to talk him into letting him go along. There are scenes where Professor Challenger (Beery) chases and assaults this man because he hates reporters. Of course, we all know the story. They do bring back a dinosaur and it gets loose (ala King Kong) and leaves a path of destruction. The special effects are like Claymation, but one could only wonder how exciting and impressive these things were in their time. As a period piece, I urge people to see this. There are full length prints of it, not just the one some have commented on, which only shows the dinosaur scenes. If you have an open mind, you will have a lot of fun.",

The set for the hotel in this film looks like the set from &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944), another film about ex-pats trying to get away.\n\nBut let me focus on the positive aspects of the film. First, there is John Hodiak. The character he plays is clever and street smart--traits that Hodiak pulls off quite well. Secondly, there are the Havana location shots that add an authenticity and the little bit of charm that the film possesses. Lastly, the (B&amp;W) photography shows some originality and adds to the mood of the narrative. \n\nThe music feels inappropriate at times, but first-rate at other times. Ms. Lamar falls short of being the woman who drives the story and who inspires a man to risk his life.",

      "reviewBody": "Before comedic artists came into Hollywood demanding they attempt a role in a very serious film, there were films like Three Amigos. Riddled with laughs, upon laugh, upon laughs, this wildly enjoyable romp through the open desert could only have been accomplished by three of our favorite comedians.\n\nThose are Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. To say that anyone in today&apos;s cinema can come close to the genius of these three powerhouses would be a lie. While I do believe that Ryan Reynolds is a very close to becoming the next Chase, nobody else can match their style, humor, and elegance. Comedy was not just a job for these three, it was an art.\n\nThree Amigos places us in a small town that is searching for some heroes that will help them get rid of some local hoodlums. Mistaking the opportunity as work, our three protagonists rush into the town prepared for the show of a lifetime. Little do they know, they are soon going to be fighting life and death. Thankfully, seriousness is in low amounts in this film, and comic hijinks ensure. Our three stumble through bars, the desert, and the final hide-a-way before their creative finale.\n\nI remember watching this film with my family when I was really young. I remember laughing at everything these three bumbling idiots did, and how impressed I was by the grace they did it with. As I grew older, this film remained with me. These three actors represent some of the funniest moments in cinematic history, and here they are gathered together to make a film. I loved this movie. I loved the absurdity, the randomness, and the sheer fun of these types of films. I miss this type of physical, pseudo-intellectual humor. I miss laughing as much as I did when I first watched this film, and when I watch it over and over again. The simplistic nature of this film allows it to be enjoyed at any time during your life. Martin, Short, and Chase are at the top of their game and never let go. It is sad to see these actors getting less and less work today. \n\nOverall, this film impressed me. It is funny, enjoyable, and so silly that you don&apos;t need to wade through the bathroom humor to get to the good stuff. It is all right there. I suggest this film to anyone that is looking to laugh and be entertained!\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****"

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure how this movie could get a bad review. Of course, there are those people who find its pace too slow. However, one must realize that this is a period drama; it&apos;s not meant to be an action-packed suspense thriller. Everything is subtle, but it is so beautifully prepared, thought out, and executed by all.\n\n1. Were it for nothing else, the technical aspects of this film would have kept me watching until the very end. The music was perfectly placed to rise and fall with the internal emotions of the characters - especially Lily and Lawrence - and to express the turmoil of the social downfall of Lily. On top of that, you have phenomenal costumes and set with the most lavish colors. Lastly, and possibly what I found most fascinating about the film, was the lighting. it always seemed just bright enough or just dark enough to reflect the romance or dreariness. In addition, there is just not denying that the way the light fell upon Gillian Anderson in every, single scene is something I have never seen before.\n\n2. The all-star cast! Gillian Anderson. Eric Stolz. Laura Linney. Anthony LaPaglia. Dan Akroyd. Do I have to go on? I can almost guarantee that you&apos;ll find yourself, at one point or another, yelling at the screen. These characters are so manipulative and deceitful and malicious. And Lily is so naive and just won&apos;t accept love when it&apos;s given!! I think the best thing about the cast and performances in this film is that watching the film and listening to it are 2 completely opposite experiences. The actors convey one thing with their faces and another with their voices; it&apos;s pure talent. I was amazed.\n\n3. If nothing else, this film should watched purely for Gillian Anderson. This project was so different than her &apos;X Files&apos; persona - and such a success, at that. The way she uses her eyes to express 5 different emotions in a matter of seconds blew me away. Her acting and utter vulnerability was awe-inspiring.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is about last of the Neanderthals, named Ao, who after loosing all his clan ventures back from Siberia to Southern Europe where he came from, to find his brother, Oa.\n\nThe film is set in pretty much realistic environment and the main guy is believable Neanderthal, though maybe little bit softer at heart, than we imagine Neanderthals would be.\n\nWe see realistic scene of his ugly Neanderthal wife giving birth to child. Realistic scene of Ao and his mate fighting bear and so on... So we prepare ourself to dig deeper into movie with documentaristic approach, we are going to see prehistoric life of humans and Neanderthals but after Ao&apos;s departure from Siberia and his first meeting with humans, the problems start.\n\nGiving that the action scenes of the movie aren&apos;t all that impressive, the love theme is not so original, there is little drama or tension that can capture your attention, it would be smartest thing to continue the movie in only available way to make it stand-out and original - I mean, making it as realistic, as possible and while it started good in that direction, it failed miserably very soon.\n\nAo meets human girl who has the appearance of top-model, apparently shaves her legs and armpits and is just too damn sexy and unbelievable for all her surrounding people and nature.\n\nFrom that moment we get cliché-driven, stupid love-escape story with predictable end. Good bye realism... good bye exploring of prehistoric life... good bye the most interesting part of the movie.\n\nI understand that it&apos;s NOT documentary and director has all the right to soften the harsh prehistoric world, but it&apos;s just too much.\n\nThis could be worse if girl couldn&apos;t act. Fortunately she can, and does it pretty good actually, but alas, she can&apos;t save the movie.\n\nThis kind of cinematography could have success in only one case, but somewhere along the production director went the very wrong way.\n\nOverall, mediocre film",

      "reviewBody": "This is the second film for Roger Moore in the role of &quot;Agent 007&quot; and even though this particular movie isn&apos;t the best it happens to be my favorite James Bond movie of them all. Essentially, the world&apos;s #1 assassin named &quot;Scaramanga&quot; (Christopher Lee) has sent a golden bullet to James Bond indicating that he is his next target. So rather than waiting around for Scaramanga to choose the time and place James Bond decides to find him first. This leads him to Beirut, Macao, Hong Kong and Bangkok in an attempt to find information that might be helpful in that regard. Now, rather than reveal the rest of the story I will just say that this movie does a good job of combining both action and comedy. As a matter of fact, I think this is probably the most humorous James Bond film ever made as it features nifty one-liners from James Bond along with &quot;Sheriff J. W. Pepper&quot; (Clifton James) and a midget named &quot;Nick Nack&quot; (Herve Villechaize). It also features two quite attractive women in Maud Adams (as Scaramanga&apos;s mistress, &quot;Andrea&quot;) and Britt Ekland (as &quot;Agent Goodnight&quot;). Again, it might not be the best James Bond movie but I found it to be quite entertaining and recommend it to all fans of the series. Above average.",

I confess myself mystified If this curious Welshman knows something that nobody else knows he should perhaps reveal it to the world and not keep it to himself there in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. It would be rather something to have rediscovered the first full-length feature version of Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein.\n\nThe &quot;stocky and coarse-featured&quot; Mr. Standing was one of an incredibly distinguished family of British actors of whom the patriarch was his father Herbert. His brothers Jack, Guy, Herbert Jr, Aubrey and Wyndham were also actors, as were the grandchildren Kay Hammond, Guy Standing Jr., Joan and Jack Standing Jr. while the representative in the current generation is actor John Standing (properly Sir John Ronald Leon Standing, 4th Baronet), long well known to British theatre and television audiences but whom, despite the critics, cinema connoisseurs will know from Peter Greenaway&apos;s 1999 film 8½ Women (all mention of which is bizarrely missing from the Wikipedia article on the actor)."

My kids loved it and have watched it about 3 times.\n\nThe sets were beautiful and intricate, the costumes and make-up are gorgeous and the special effects are amazing. Rick Baker &quot;Monster Maker&quot; is so talented and has done an impressive (as always) job creating a vision from the Haunted Mansion ride that he also admired.\n\nIf you are a fan of the ride, I would imagine that you would enjoy this movie as much as me.",

      "reviewBody": "Following the death of thirty-two members of an SS battalion in a bomb attack carried out by Italian partisans in Rome&apos;s Via Rasella on 23rd March 1944, an incandescent Hitler ordered that ten Italians be executed for every soldier killed and that this be carried out within twenty-four hours. The officer assigned this gruesome task was Lt. Colonel Herbert Kappler who carried out the order with ruthless efficiency.\n\nThe style of this film by Filippo Walter Ratti, a director hitherto unfamiliar to me, is very much influenced by &apos;Rome, open City&apos; but of course the stunning immediacy of the earlier film cannot be replicated. It remains however a gripping, visceral piece which concentrates mainly on the final hours of the hostages. They are played by actors who are probably unfamiliar to the average non-European viewer, notably Andrea Checchi, Sergio Fantoni and Ivo Garrani. As a baron who tries unsuccessfully to obtain a release for his son, Gino Cervi brings his customary solid presence. Kappler is chillingly played by Carlo d&apos;Angelo. He is not the only actor to play the role as he has since been portrayed by Richard Burton in &apos;Massacre in Rome&apos; and on the small screen by Christopher Plummer in &apos;The Scarlet and the Black&apos;.\n\nThere is a connection between this and Rossellini&apos;s film in that one of those executed was the priest Don Pietro Pappagallo who became the inspiration for Don Pietro Pellegrini, so memorably played by Aldo Fabrizi. Most viewers will probably recognise in Mariella&apos;s desperate run behind the truck carrying her doomed lover an echo of Anna Magnani&apos;s iconic dash in the earlier film.\n\nThe stark cinematography of Aldo Greci and the ominous score by Armando Trovaioli add immeasurably to the film&apos;s power.\n\nParticularly moving is the scene where Assunta reads letters from both her husband and teenage son telling her that they are soon to die.\n\nIt was political theorist Hannah Arendt in 1961 who first coined the controversial phrase &apos;the banality of evil&apos; and no doubt Kappler claimed that he was only following orders. This is a highly emotive topic and films such as this serve as a distressing reminder of the depravity to which humans can sink.",

      "reviewBody": "**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**\n\nLacking the formidable cultural legacy of his earlier Apu trilogy, CHARULATA (Ray&apos;s 11th film) lacks nothing else  if Ray&apos;s overall style was derived from neo-realism; CHARULATA proved that  in his own uncluttered way  he was also a master of style and subtle elegance.\n\nCHARULATA was perhaps Ray&apos;s most technically stunning work, featuring an elegant - if moody - story shot in a manner that finds Ray experimenting a bit. The story is set in an upper-class, intellectual household in 1890s India, and the period setting is rendered in great detail  giving the film a lush, living beauty that (thanks to the stunning cinematography of Subrata Mitra) never crosses over into stuffiness. In a handful of scenes, a French new wave influence can also be seen  primarily at the very end, and also in an earlier scene featuring the title character&apos;s recollections (in a quick-moving montage) of childhood memories. \n\nBased on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, the film explores marital complacency, as Bhupati (a wealthy publisher and political idealist, devotes the majority of his time to his publishing business, and to political interests, and grows increasingly isolated from his wife, Charulata. Charulata  as an attractive upper-class wife, is essentially expected to manage the household, and not much else, and is increasingly both lonesome (Bhupati is a generally pleasant enough husband, though also a severe workaholic who is rarely around, and - in his sexual politics - he is a product of his time) and intellectually restless. \n\nIn the midst of this, Bhupati&apos;s younger brother Amal arrives  Amal, a romantically inclined bohemian and recent college graduate who is searching for work while also pursuing literary ambitions, and has temporarily moved into the household. Amal and Charulata are instantly drawn to each other  first as intellectual companions, before an awareness of attraction is recognized. The two are plainly aware of the impossibility of the unrequited relationship, as Bhupati  after discovering than an employee has been embezzling form him  is then devastated to discover that his wife is turning away from him. \n\nTo highlight the increasing distance between each of the three characters, CHARULATA is formalistic in it&apos;s look (with the handful of well-placed new-wave-inflected scenes adding textural complexity and emotionalism), with the classical touches of the cinematography underscoring the characters&apos; ever-increasing distance from each other. Exploring sexual and class politics - with great depth and complexity - in a historical setting (while  in its&apos; exploration of idealistic, nationalistic politics  making subtle connections to the present-day handling of the same issues in Bengali society), with flawless performances from all, CHARULATA is a beautiful and haunting masterpiece.",

But when everything&apos;s just a joke, nothing is funny and plots fall apart. Without the bitter, the sweet ain&apos;t the sweet, as Cameron Crowe once put it. &quot;Robert Zimmermann&quot; is a shallow comedy set in a fabricated limbo land half-way between the present and the post-war past. Robert, a computer game designer with the looks and moves of a 15-year old kid, falls in love with his laundry lady, a single mom and some 40 years Robert&apos;s senior, baffling his girlfriend, his buddies, and his parents. But then, his father keeps a twenty-something mistress, his mother tests the waters of menopausal romance, and his lesbian sister is pregnant with her childhood sweetheart&apos;s offspring. The only good thing about this movie is Annika Kuhl. She plays Robert&apos;s sister Pia and the minute you see her, you believe her character has a life off the screen, perhaps even some sort of secret. By comparison, everyone else is just an extra. Think of Pia as this movie&apos;s Margot Tenenbaum. Incidentally, she is also the director&apos;s girlfriend. He obviously has better taste in women than he has in movies. Guest appearance by Art Garfunkel&apos;s son.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a lovely tale chronicling the autumn days of Robin Hood&apos;s life and his rekindled romance with his lost love, Marian. The only reason I didn&apos;t rate it higher is that I was hoping for more scenes with Robin &amp; Marian together, as opposed to the men&apos;s exploits. The movie relates Robin&apos;s story from an unusual perspective, not as the legendary dashing young archer &amp; outlaw, but as an aging hero with some physical infirmities, making him all the more appealing. But Robin Hood still has some fight left in him...\n\nThe much older Robin has returned from the Crusades to Sherwood Forest, accompanied by his faithful friend and constant companion, Little John. His old love, Marian, is by this time a nun, in fact the Mother Superior of an Abbey. Politically, King Richard the Lionheart and his brother, Prince John, are basically greedy idiots and definitely no asset to the peasants. Robin&apos;s old nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham, is as menacing as ever, and Robin must again summon a band of loyal followers (including his old cohorts, Will Scarlett and Friar Tuck) to protect the innocent from the Sheriff&apos;s tyranny.\n\nThe two stars are perfect in this mature love story, with its dramatic ending that I won&apos;t give away here. Sean Connery makes a sympathetic and compelling but weary hero, as Robin comes to grips with his aging, his physical limitations, and his mortality. Audrey Hepburn with her ageless beauty is radiant, dignified, and graceful as Marian. The pair are absolutely beautiful together on screen.\n\nActually, the most engrossing relationship in this film might just be between the two old adversaries, Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham, who form a sort of bond and develop mutual respect. Robert Shaw is absolutely perfect in his role as the Sheriff, who seems almost sympathetic &amp; honourable here, not quite his usual completely villainous self. Their struggle culminates in a dramatic sword duel. Another relationship well developed is the one between Robin and his faithful friend, the gentle giant, Little John, who is portrayed by Nicol Williamson. Richard Harris plays the malevolent King Richard, though I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy of the depiction.\n\nThis movie has beautiful cinematography and musical scoring. Though Robin is no longer the daring young adventurer of old, this story is much more compelling than some other adaptations, notably the vastly inferior Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner. Perhaps less exciting derring do than other tales, this film (to its credit) tends to humanize the mythical medieval hero. It is a touching, bittersweet, and melancholy tale of autumn in Sherwood Forest...for Robin&apos;s band of Merry Men, his lady, his foe, and especially the legendary hero himself.",

First of all, you have Fredric March, whose tour-de-force performance as the good-natured Jekyll and the monstrous Hyde earned him the Best Actor Oscar. Second, the camera work by Karl Struss brilliantly captures the mood of the story. And lastly, the transformation sequences set an enormous precedent for the later monster movies. It all blends together to form one of most amazing horror movies of the 1930&apos;s. Even today, it still has the power to mesmerize and send chills down the spine of even the most hardened horror fan.",

      "reviewBody": "There are many parallels to other twisty, turning, &quot;are they alive or dead?&quot; films of this genre that probably do it at lot better but Burr Steers effort is undeniably entertaining. He has some great acting from Charlie Tahan in particular to raise the rating a notch or two too.\n\nThe opening is neatly crafted as back story explaining how brothers Charlie (Efron) and Sam (Tahan) are as inseparable in death as in life. Fast forward five years and we have the revelation of a gift Charlie may, or may not, have. The story takes over from there as a charmingly meandering exploration of promises, principles, reasons and deeply held beliefs. Zac Efron gives a goodish but slightly uneven presentation of the &quot;man with a mission&quot;, his own worse enemy, but also one of his word. There are moments when Efron is very convincing but there are others when he seems to be going through the motions. What Charlie Tahan succeeds in doing is taking the simple and raw and keeping it simple and raw, something Efron needs to work on.\n\nAmanda Crew is good as the romantic interest and there are a couple of cameos from Kim Basinger and Ray Liotta.\n\nNow I will not plot spoil to reveal the bigger flaws in the script but I was not expecting a revelation to be made in quite the way it was, and at the time was left thinking - that&apos;s stupid it should have been done differently without spoiling the story - but that is show business for you! Overall it is a worthwhile film with a reasonable point to make. I give it seven out of ten.",

Not even once. It&apos;s the difference between being on a cruise ship deck and being down in the sluices, sliding around in the vomit from all the seasick people. Up on deck you might know that the ship has places you&apos;d rather not go and spoil the cruise. This film is all sluice. And it would take weeks to wash it off. This film is an insult to the human condition. Watch it by choice only if you are on the edge of suicide and need something to push you over the edge with the sheer futility of human existence.",

      "reviewBody": "Dario Argento&apos;s recent work may not be as solid as his 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s stuff but he throws enough boobs and blood at the screen in &quot;Dracula 3D&quot; to keep you entertained. The film feels like a throwback to some of his 70&apos;s/early 80&apos;s output due to the dubbing and bad acting. The opening sex scene set in a barn feels like it was ripped from a classic 70&apos;s giallo. The CGI effects are pretty lame and seem cheap (like Playstation 1 cheap). But the practical effects (slashed throats,heads getting ripped off) all look solid.\n\nAsia Argento gets nude and Miriam Giovanelli is sexy as the voluptuous Tanja. Seriously, Giovanelli has the best breasts I&apos;ve seen in a horror film since the 80&apos;s. Rutger Hauer shows up an hour in and he does a solid job, albeit looking very haggard and bored. The film&apos;s biggest flaw is that it&apos;s too long. At an hour and fifty minutes, &quot;Dracula 3D&quot; could have used some editing to trim it down.\n\nOverall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth checking out if you&apos;re a fan of Argento or want to see a semi-fresh take on the Dracula lore."

Sure there&apos;s a village that wants to sacrifice these 2 girls to their god, but it&apos;s not really &apos;horror&apos; at all. The movie unfolds as an action/suspense movie really as the two leads are separated minutes into the movie and then we have follow their survival paths and see where they continually almost link up. It sounds cliché almost, but really it works. There&apos;s no body count, no gore, just an old fashioned &quot;who&apos;s betrayed me&quot; plot while running from the masses. And I actually did NOT figure out whodunit and was nicely surprised when it all unfolded.",

A meteorite with a blob inside it lands, attatches itself to an old man&apos;s hand, engulfs the old man, a nurse, a doctor, and so on...until it is a huge mass of jelly-like substance squeezing through small openings and killing anything and everything in its path. A very young Steve McQueen plays the small-town teenager who just can&apos;t get any of the establishment(adults) to listen to him. The film was shot with a shoestring budget and the actors, with the exception of McQueen who shows talent and personality even at this youthful age, range from mediocre to downright bad(Doc Hallen for example), but none of that is overly important to the monster itself. Nothing like it had ever been on film before and some scenes stand out as decidedly very original and memorable. The Spook Movie festival in the movie theater and the finale at the diner are such classic scenes."

The Mexican people took on their own the welcoming of all the athletes and visitors, Mexicans expressed openly as it is for them natural, their unconditional friendship and hospitality. \n\nFor the first time Mexico won a medal, a bronze medal that no matter how small it was the prize the masses went out to celebrate Mexico! This movie also shows the spirit of the Mexican athletes who participated not to win but to represent their country showing effort, the pain of the events happening then, a government who doesn&apos;t deserve their people, the poor, humble, illiterate but noble people, the greatness of their spirit no matter the economical circumstances."

      "reviewBody": "When the fastidious &quot;Lt. Paul Przygodski&quot; (David Bowie) returns to Berlin society after the end of the Great War, he finds that things have profoundly changed and that his skills - such as they are - are not going to help him make much of a living. What he does have, though, is looks. He can easily turn an head or two when he walks into a room and so quickly realises that he can make some money &quot;entertaining&quot; the wealthier class of lady - already married or not, or even the occasion gentleman. As the Weimar Republic starts to give way to embryonic Naziism, the story also attempts to take a more serious track attempting to illustrate the profound societal changes in the city and the country whilst he and his clientele attempt to stay aloof and immune from the increasing anger and intolerance on the streets. It&apos;s really that attempt at the political that spoils this. Had it been left as a seedy story of a man using his beauty and, to an extent, his brains to get on in life then it have made for a decent watch. It doesn&apos;t though, it meanders all over the place mixing it&apos;s themes and delivering something that doesn&apos;t quite seem to know where it wants to go or who it&apos;s for. There&apos;s a decent enough effort from Sydne Rome as maybe the only honest woman in his life &quot;Cilly&quot; and there&apos;s a charming cameo from Marlene Dietrich who just about manages to, almost breathlessly, sing the title song but the rest of the cast seem underused and their characterisations undercooked to the point where I began to wonder if the likes of Kim Novak and Curd Jürgens just owed director David Hemmings a favour. It has it&apos;s moments, but just not quite enough of them and it does show up Bowie as rather wooden.",

      "description": "BERLIN IN THE 1920s ... A time of change, a time of upheaval. Paul von Pryzgodski (David Bowie, Labyrinth) was a young man whose life had led him to expect heroism, but instead, he found failure - failure in the Great War, failure at trying to find a career, failure at nearly every relationship that comes his way until he meets the Baroness and discovers there is one profession at which he can excel.\r\n\r\nThis offbeat German melodrama directed by David Hemmings stars David Bowie as Paul, a young Prussian War veteran who returns home to Berlin after World War I. After drifting from job to job, Paul eventually finds his niche renting himself out as a dancer for war widows who long to forget their sadness. Kim Novak (Vertigo) sizzles as a sad widow, with German bombshell Maria Schell as Paul&apos;s mother and Sydne Rome as his old sweetheart-turned-cabaret singer. Marlene Dietrich makes a poignant cameo (it was her last film role) as an aging baroness, singing the title song, aka Schoner Gigolo, armer Gigolo.",

Debord&apos;s anti cinema statement might be considered repellent in his first film (when it is extremist innovation); but in this one, the use of stills upon which the discourse progresses from the evocation of the mechanisms of the society of the spectacle, the alienation by consumption, the oppression of modern society to the deception of imbecile propaganda cinema, transmitting falsehood, to considerations about Paris, the loss of its true spirit and about himself, Guy Debord, is not only an illustration of détournement. It is a beautiful work in which the relation between the image and the narration is incessantly questioned; the two expressions interfere enigmatically, in a secret game of analogies, they collide, complete each others, combine to produce a third element that a linear use of cinematic images produced for the narration would fail to achieve. Not only the political content is pretty up to date but it is simply a beautiful work of modern visual poetry.",

Some good humour, Cheburashka was very cute (was surprised how well graphics were considering that this is not American production ) . But as an adult I really liked Gena&apos;s character and his story moved my heart to tears (and every other adult in the theatre) . I don&apos;t know if teenagers or people in their 20&apos;s would enjoy it as much as kids and people in their 30&apos;s and older but I strongly recommend it. I think movie did quite well at the box office and they plan to make a sequel and Im glad to hear it. I would like so see Cheburashka and Gena again. Good job :) And also I&apos;ve noticed that a lot of people gave this movie 1 as their rating but I doubt these people actually saw the movie and perhaps they have alterior motives for rating  movie so low....",

He was world renown as a comedian, yet has placed some of the most poignant images on film that ever were. He was, even more than the great Orson Welles, a sort of one man band.\n\nHe was as successful worldwide as anyone ever was in movies. Somehow in all this, he got the idea that he had something worthwhile to say about life and art. Which he did with this film.. and I for one am extremely grateful.\n\nThe subjects of alcoholism... depression... aging... the fickle relationships of audiences and performers... these are all covered in a film that manages to fit in philosophical dialog, pantomime, dancing, and music. The multiple showings of the same comedy sequence (in a dream, in front of an unappreciative audience, in front of a wildly appreciative audience) gets one to thinking about the lemming-like nature of people in a way that someone like Chaplin would have had almost unique insight into.\n\nIt may take a while to become accustomed to the odd pacing and cadence of a Chaplin movie; once you are, you find yourself in the middle of an artistic experience like no other.\n\nThe music in this film is unusually haunting and deserving of the Academy award it belatedly received. 10 out of 10.",

Having a great music score from the master Ennio Morricone can&apos;t even save this one from being a below average example.\n\nThe most notable spaghetti western regular in this film is Fernando Sancho, who is usually great to watch, but here his role is simply that of a crony, and he doesn&apos;t get to shine.\n\nAs for the MacGregors, the senior members of the clan are gritty, tough old Scots, and I kind of liked them, but you don&apos;t really see that much of them in the film. The story focuses on the sons, who are so ridiculously happy-go-lucky it makes you sick. It&apos;s like watching a gang of seven Peter Pans, and they act like puppy dogs every time they see a pretty girl. In reality, these guys wouldn&apos;t survive very long in a brutal cutthroat western environment, yet somehow they do. The movie is also part love story, of course.\n\nThe most notable part of the film is an especially brutal scene where a guy is repeatedly dragged through a fire.\n\nThis one&apos;s kind of lame, and not really worth seeking out when there are so many better eurowesterns to choose from.",

      "reviewBody": "To Max Ophüls this was an assignment (from the UFA), a pure routine job. One hardly recognizes the later Ophüls in this film (shortly made before his masterpiece &quot;Liebelei&quot;), but still Ophüls made this routine job into a well-paced, stylish and sometimes extremely funny romantic comedy; he probably could not do it any other way. The script is fine with some hilarious dialogue. The use of the surnames of the characters is simple but clever.\n\nHaving Ophüls in mind the film can also be considered a celebration of happy-go-lucky life: contrasted are those who live an easy going, wine and dine life with those whose narrow-minded life is based on punctuality and mineral water. Maybe that is why the film was banned in 1937: it was considered a film that could endanger public order and national-socialist feelings.\n\nGood cast with Heinz Rühmann who shows his natural comic talent at best and Max Adalbert who is very good as the grumpy uncle; supporting cast good as well. Chauvinism makes me want to point out Lien Deyers (as Gina), a fine, charming and attractive actress from The Netherlands who had a successful career in German cinema."

      "reviewBody": "In a way, Sørensen and Rasmussen is a strange film because it is about the struggle of reaching a position in society far higher than birth allows. The set on the other hand has nothing what so ever to do with what could have been a bitter social-realistic survey of the oppression of the lower social classes, then the film is set at a mansion like the regular fairy-tale stories of good vs. evil. The quarters of the lowest ranking stable-boy are nice and cosy as are those of the master and mistress. This film should be regarded as a memento to the dying absolutism - for only the will of the king changes the social rules. And the excellent performance of both leading actresses should be noted too.",

They play the siblings of much older sister Peggy Moran whose only other film appearance I&apos;ve seen was in One Night in the Tropics-Abbott &amp; Costello&apos;s first movie. Like there, she also plays a humorously aggressive female not resistant to being a bit rude to men. Besides Alfalfa, another former cast member of his former series (though in entries way before his arrival) that appeared here was Edgar Kennedy who was a cop there. Here, he&apos;s a mayor who always corrects himself-or tries to-when using wrong contractions. Alfalfa would eventually be a player in my favorite movie-It&apos;s a Wonderful Life-and so would a fellow player here-Charles Halton. Neither appeared together there or here. The actual star is Hugh Herbert, a comedian who plays two roles here. I&apos;ll just say this was quite funny and screwy with all those players and some plot developments that must be seen to be believed. The version I saw on YouTube was washed out so if this is ever on DVD, I hope to see a clearer copy someday...",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; remains to be one of the great films of the nineties, sitting alongside &quot;Bright Angel&quot; as one of the decade&apos;s most tragically neglected classics. Perhaps the fact it contains such a high degree of subtlety was why it wasn&apos;t appreciated when it was first released, the most frequently stated criticism being that its climax is dramatically unsatisfying, yet its somber ending works perfectly. Outside of &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; it is unquestionably Meg Ryan&apos;s finest performance, the same going for Quaid who gives his character a quiet desperation that becomes quite devastating by the end. Caan is great as always, but it is Paltrow who really impresses, playing a role bereft of the sugary sweetness that plagued the majority of her roles that followed. Scott Wilson also shines in a small but memorable role. &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; may never receive the attention it deserves, which is a shame because it is unquestionably a lyrical masterpiece, beautifully shot and acted, recalling those low-key gems of the seventies like &quot;The Rain People&quot;. Highly recommended."

The music is also very good, I believe by George Fenton, and suits and supports the music and is worth the listen all on its own.\n\nEven my husband loves to watch this movie with me, and its one of our well beloved date movies, sensual, moving, yet ultimately triumphant. In an odd sort of way, I got an almost female version of Braveheart in the courtroom scene at the end... Try it! It&apos;s worth it!",

Honestly, most movies from this period don&apos;t stand up all that well. It was an experimental time and experiments usually go bad. That&apos;s the nature of attempting to be creative. Most Hollywood crap barely tries for competent and rarely considers creative.\n\nFor no other reason, the context of Thunderclap Newman&apos;s &quot;Something in the Air&quot; (on of the all time greatest rock songs) is worth experiencing this movie. A pretty damn good version of &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; can be found here, too.",

The story mainly follows Edek, an 11 year old buy who starts hanging out with the intriguing and flirting next door girl Monika, and how their friendship/relationship evolves. Edek is a simple boy, while Monika is the total opposite, boasting a different sophisticated lifestyle.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot with nice scenes in the nature featuring Edek and Monika, accompanied by nice music and moments that might make you compare the movie a bit to the Swedish director Roy Anderssons debut movie &quot;A Swedish love story&quot; which was released in 1970. A well-made portrait of what it might feel like to have your first real crush on another person, and the confusion that also follows.\n\nThe plot has a few twists but is kept relatively simple as the target group for the movie is the same age group as the kids in the movie, kids in their pre-teens. But an entertaining movie as well for adults.",

Rory Calhoun is the most likable evil human flesh farmer I&apos;ve ever seen.  There really isn&apos;t too much gore in this film, but it grosses you out on so many levels, especially if you eat meat, which I do.  The ending, while being awesome in its own way, leaves a little something to be desired.  All in all, if you love horror, and you have a sense of humor, check this one on out.  I liked it more the second time I saw it, which is a sign of quality.",

And absorbing.\n\nBut it&apos;s not all good news: turning one of the brothers into a monster with a horrible face after a contamination is perhaps not a good idea ; it does not bring anything substantial to the plot (it&apos;s a variation on the &quot;Gattaca &quot; theme) and ,in my book , seems a commercial cheap trick ;besides the character of the mother is embarrassing ,which the actress does nothing to rectify .\n\nThe twins relationship could have been an interesting psychological drama without this awful make-up and ,from that point of view ,it&apos;s a missed opportunity."

Quite a relaxed and personal movie by David. it focuses on the experiences of one person, part of the &quot;Kommando&quot; and gets quite personal, but also tells the broader story.\n\nDefinitely worth a look. I haven&apos;t seen anything else about the same subject matter so it is a bit hard to compare to other documentaries on the subject. Compared to dramatizations of similar events this is a much more calm retelling and also contains something that is often missing...how do you go on with your life after participating in a such a deed?",

      "reviewBody": "Can you imagine the perpetually tired Lewis Stone in The Prisoner of Zenda? He has to play the senior advisor to the king, right? He&apos;s far too old and patriarchal to play the lead. . . So one would think. Well, in 1922, Lew was neither old, fatherly, nor tired. He played the dual leads, and he was given a brown wig! Full of energy, wonderful expressions to communicate to the audience without words, and the ability to both perform stunts and woo a fair maiden, Lew takes charge and acts like a leading man.\n\nIf you&apos;ve never seen any of the movie versions or read the book, the story is very exciting. Just before a king&apos;s coronation, his evil brother plans to drug and kidnap him so that he can&apos;t be crowned the king. However, the king&apos;s faithful aides find a lookalike, completely by accident, and get him to impersonate the king during the coronation! If you&apos;ve seen the modern-day comedy Dave, starring Kevin Kline, you&apos;ll have a basic understanding of the story.\n\nI&apos;ve seen three versions of this movie, and while the 1937 version is the best, this one is extremely impressive. It&apos;s amazing to see what Hollywood was capable of in 1922: the costumes, the sets, the elaborate action scenes with moats, drawbridges, and swordfights. At almost two hours, this is a lengthy silent movie, and there are quite a lot of title cards for you to read, but if you know the story, you won&apos;t be lost. Those who don&apos;t like silent movies will be incredibly bored, but if you like the change of pace and different way of storytelling, this is one worth watching, if only to see what Lewis Stone looks like with brown hair. It doesn&apos;t feel like it was made so early in the decade; if it had a 1928 timestamp on it, I&apos;d believe it.",

      "reviewBody": "So let me start off by saying that I understand the film had its problems, but I still enjoyed it, and if you really don&apos;t have anything better to watch, then this is a good time-killer. So the idea is neat, people have brain implants connected to the eyes like a cyborg, and someone hacks it, changing reality to become anonymous. And while this idea is very cool and was interesting for about 45 to 50 minutes, but I feel like this would have made a better short film, because that idea is mostly all they have and its drawn out, the techy tricks only go so far. I like the actors in this one like Seyfied and Owen, and they did a moderately serviceable job in their roles. The first few hacker tricks are neat but it gets old after a while, and I found myself waiting for the ending. I felt the film drags on pulling out the same old trick. But thats just my opinion.\n\nSo as I said, I like the tricks and special effects involved, but that was truly the only thing I really LIKED. Everything else was average or above average at most. The acting was fine, considering it had some respected actors in it. The cinematography outside the special effects and what not was also very average, nothing to be amazed at like certain genius cinematographers. Honestly it wasn&apos;t a fantastic film, but it also wasn&apos;t terrible and 1 star like some people are saying, I enjoyed MOST of it, kind of got bored towards the end, but the first couple of tricks were fun, and I&apos;ll give them that.",

      "name": "Mediocre Paella/US Western filmed in Spain  with short budget and  Hollywood actors",
      "reviewBody": "Spanish-US co-production full of action , violent characters , thrills and lots of shots . A good example of Latino western genre mostly filmed in Spain . This is a co-production Spanish-American with a varied cast formed by actors of diverse countries . This meaty Western contains violence , shoot&apos;em up , interesting plot based on Louis L&apos;Amour novel but being regularly developed , and results to be quite entertaining , though drags at times , balancing in ups and downs . In 1870 Kid Rodelo (Don Murray) finishes his prison period after serving a year inside Yuma Territorial Prison and goes out from jail in which continues the remaining executers of a robbing on a valuable loot . Kid Rodelo is released from prison but his previous colleagues , the embittered Joe Harbin (Broderick Crawford) and Thomas Reese (José Nieto) prepare their escape . Harbin and Reese kidnap the chief warden (Emilio Rodríguez) , take him as a hostage and get to break out . Meanwhile , the ex-convict cowboy sets out to find the hidden gold his partner told him but he is chased by his partners . When they are crossing the frontier into Mexico are pursued by the Yaquis led by Cavalry Hat (Jose Villasante) and his underlings (Alvaro De Luna) . You just don&apos;t mess around with a man like Kid Rodelo . \n\nIt&apos;s an average Western mostly produced by Spain and US important participation ; it doesn&apos;t follow the Sergio Leone wake and being proceeded in American style . The picture scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group , including their enormous difficulties to escape from prison and strong taking on between protagonists and the Yaqui Indians that stalk to them . The film blends thrills , intrigue , high body-count ; it&apos;s fast moving and exciting but mediocre , being filmed in Spain . Chorizo/US Western with various Hollywood top-of-the range players such as Don Murray , Broderick Crawford and Janet Leigh . The film packs violence , shootouts and an intriguing story about ambition and treason . It&apos;s a thrilling western with continuous confrontation between the protagonist Don Murray against the heartless Broderick Crawford , Jose Nieto , Julio Peña and hoodlums . Don Murray is fine, he ravages the screen , hit and run , kills and falls in love for the girl , Janet Leigh . \n\nThis is an exciting film , plenty action , thrills , fights , gun-down and breathtaking outdoors from Spain such as Alicante , Comunidad Valenciana , Colmenar Viejo , Hoyo De Manzanares and La Pedriza , Madrid . Well-made action sequences with rousing attacks and spectacularly realistic shootouts . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The Hollywood actor , slimy Don Murray of ¨Bus Stop¨ is good in his usual two-fisted role . Fantastic performance by the always great Broderick Crawford as the burly , menacing convict make up for , here in his ordinary role as a cruelly baddie character , he is terrific, and bears a hysterical and tough aspect . Appears as secondaries the habitual in Spanish/Italian Western such as Jose Nieto , Julio Peña , Miguel Del Castillo , Emilio Rodríguez and Alvaro de Luna , who nowadays continues playing , here as an Indian . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot&apos;em up or stunts every few minutes . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the final gunfights and the spectacular conclusion in desert when protagonists are besieged by Indians . The sense of pacing is such that his film can be counted on to move quickly and smoothly . The musician Manuel Parada composes an atmospheric soundtrack , though in the American version is credited Johnny Douglas . It packs an imperfect cinematography by Manuel Merino , being necessary alright remastering because of the film-copy is washed-out .\n\nThe motion picture was produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero who started producing ¨Il Coyote¨ and ¨The Jiusticia De Coyote¨ by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Abel Salazar and Gloria Marin . After that , he produced with his company Copercines ¨Vengeance of Zorro¨ and ¨L&apos;Ombra Di Zorro¨ (1962) by Joaquin Marchent with Frank Latimore . Eduardo Manzanos built a Western town in Hoyo De Manzanares (Madrid) with sets by Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia , today sadly disappeared , called ¨Golden City¨ where filmed several Western as ¨Welcome Padre Murray¨ , ¨Brandy¨ , various Zorros and this one . He produced various films for Marchent brothers as Joaquin Romero Marchent : ¨Cabalgando Hacia Muerte¨ , ¨Three good men¨; and Rafael Marchent : ¨Quien Grita vengeance¨, ¨Two crosses in Danger Pass¨ ; and for Italian directors as ¨Sabor Odio¨ by Umberto Lenzi¨and ¨Winchester 1 between 1000¨ by Primo Zeglio , ¨At the end of the rainbow¨ by Aldo Florio and this ordinary ¨Kid Rodelo¨ , with no Sergio Leone&apos;s style , it is an usual example of American western though it is partly Spanish and partly Italian . The motion picture was middlingly directed and in traditional style by Richard Carlson . Richard was a notorious actor who even played two classic movies such as It came from outer space and Creature from the black lagoon . He subsequently accepted charge of directing a silly pseudo-scientific premise entitled Riders to the Stars (1954), a low-budget enterprise bogged down at the expense of drama. In the course of the next twelve years, he directed some better second features, including the westerns Four Guns to the Border (1954) , The saga of Hamp Brown and Kid Rodelo (1966), many of them starred by Rory Calhoun , as well as a number of television episodes. He also wrote the occasional TV script, as well as contributing articles on non-fiction subjects to several magazines .",

      "reviewBody": "Surprise! There is a horror series that holds up well, even on the second sequel.\n\nIt&apos;s difficult to explain the plot in any detail without ruining the storyline, so instead, I give you small chunks. A doctor must keep Jigsaw alive. If he dies, so does she. A grieving father must decided what he will do when confronted with the people that changed his life for the worse. Saying anything else about the story line is just criminal.\n\nLike the 2 movies before it, difficult decisions and some nasty secrets become a part of a much larger plan. It manages to explain events in Saw 1 and 2 that may have been considered plot holes. It spins the whole concept of the Jigsaw character and what he represents, and the message he is trying to say. By carefully placing events from the past in a certain order, and by introducing important sequences of the character&apos;s lives, Saw 3 manages to become a pivotal point to the series. It&apos;s not perfect, though. Constant flashbacks to memories becomes a bit tiresome. Some of the dialog could be a combination of dry, repetitive, or dumb, or all of the above. And oh yes, there will be the improbable &amp; illogical. Big critics will focus on this, and consider the movie a waste of time.\n\nOf course, you can toss out the psychological-babble, tell the critics to go back to their coke snorting, and just have fun watching the movie as pure horror. Of the three, this is ultimately the most bloodiest. Those of low tolerance of gore, medical procedures and general dismemberment beware: the movie theater I went to here in Winter Springs had one movie-goer faint and fall to the floor. They had to temporarily stop the movie and take her outside, an ambulance came, and took her away. Even with this interruption, the movie kept everyone awake, wanting to see more. By the end of the movie, the audience clapped. We liked what we had seen. &quot;What has the world come to?&quot;, you say? Geez. You are in the wrong place. I&apos;m sure there will be some Disney movie to your liking.\n\nThe traps were clever, original, and far, far deadlier this time around. To me, it beats out any psycho with a knife/ax/chainsaw crap movie that has been pumped out too many times. It&apos;s a shame that Saw producer Gregg Hoffman passed away before this movie was produced.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are truly hilarious. The dialogs are witty and colloquial. The tension in the film comes not so much from the &apos;murder mystery&apos; plot as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel.\n\nThe first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an ageing drifter, with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness, who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with plenty of good-natured smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to be intimidating.\n\nThe second story tells how a salesman,played by Jean Yanne, gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe this better.\n\nAfter a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end, in a surprising but also logical ending.\n\nThe film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director&apos;s father (the celebrated Michel Audiard) used to write, and the &quot;typical french film&quot; with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions.",

      "reviewBody": "For some reason (possibly due to the marketing) people seem to think that The Day is about zombies. It&apos;s not. It doesn&apos;t even feature a slightly hungry vampire. It&apos;s totally UN-supernatural (unless you count the fact that the world has - technically - come to an end and everyone&apos;s living in a post-apocalyptic landscape).\n\nFive survivors take refuge in a farmhouse which basically doesn&apos;t belong to them. Soon, those who own it come for what they believe is theirs. Carnage ensues.\n\nFirst of all I have to mention &apos;the look&apos; of this film. I know it&apos;s meant to be bleak, but the film-makers have gone to the added length of basically draining all the colour from the footage. It certainly does the trick. The atmosphere is definitely bleak. During the night scenes, you might as well be watching a black and white film. This will appeal to some, others may find it a little annoying.\n\nAfter a (very!) slow start, the five characters (of whom we get to know and care for reasonably well) come under siege from the owners of the farmhouse (apparently, in an earlier draft they were zombies). This is, of course, when the majority of the action starts. Although, it comes well into the final third of the movie, making the &apos;climax&apos; shorter than you might expect.\n\nThe Day has a kind of &apos;28 Days Later&apos; look and feel to it (helped by the pretty good musical score) and plays out like Assault on Precinct 13.\n\nI&apos;ve seen a lot of reviewers raving about The Day, but, despite a few nice touches here and there (plus some bits that actually surprised a hardened film-goer like myself), I never thought it was that much of a classic.\n\nIn short, it&apos;s not bad. If you&apos;re looking for a post-apocalyptic version of Precinct 13 then this one could be for you.",

All the exciting cinematic clichés that have ever been written are showcased in this movie with a shameless sense of excitement like we have never witnessed before.\n\nAnother important point that works for this movie is the casting - three of the best bad guys to ever grace Bollywood are a team in this one - Paresh Rawal, Sadashiv Amrapurkar and Gulshan Grover. The movie also stars Karisma Kapoor, which is not surprising, as she has acted in bigger cinematic debacles before.\n\nPolice Officer is not for the weak hearted or people who are looking for a real police thriller. Both will be sorely disappointed.\n\nBottom line, Aruna Irani (the mother, who else), has a dog that she considers a son and calls Ram, Asrani is a police officer and Raza Murad is the Police Commissioner, if that is not reason enough, what can be?",

Sure enough, the aliens aren&apos;t interested in peace -- they&apos;re planning an invasion of Earth -- and it is up to the masked Mexican wrestler to send them packing.\n\nFrom the beefy, shirtless, male Martians in silly wigs and silver capes and the beautiful busty blonde female crewmembers in matching leotards, to the many badly staged wrestling scenes, to the ridiculous sci-fi special effects, which include a hilarious hubcap flying saucer, an &apos;astral eye&apos; vaporiser, and a transformation chamber that changes the Martians hairstyles and clothing, Santo vs The Martians is pure &apos;60s camp. The fantastical elements are entertaining for their sheer cheeziness (the budget was obviously very low), and a dance routine by the four sexy female aliens is hilarious, but the fighting, of which there is quite a lot, is fairly dull, unless you happen to particularly enjoy watching burly, sweaty, semi-naked men grappling with each other.",

But I must say Two Show Steallers were Big B and the Kid. She was super. Adorable acting by her. Sanjay&apos;s Song is wasted. Good that no songs as script really does not allow you this.\n\nThailand locales are good. Shot Nicely.\n\nI give 7 out of 10. More for power packed performances. Big B in action role after a long gap. Last was &quot;Kaante&quot; so I say go watch it if you have not yet.",

      "name": "Campy Yet Worthwhile Lovecraft Adaptation",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; of 1970 may not be great Horror, but it is nonetheless a worthwhile little film that has many qualities. The film is based on the writings of the almighty H.P. Lovecraft, which may be one of the reasons why many fellow Horror lovers find it to be disappointing. Many films based on Lovecraft writings are downright brilliant all-time Horror-greats, above all Roger Corman&apos;s &quot;Haunted Palace&quot; (1963) with Vincent Price (which was marketed as a Poe-adaptation), Sam Raimi&apos;s &quot;Evil Dead&quot; (1981) and Stuart Gordon&apos;s &quot;Re-Animator&quot; (1985), just to name three absolute masterpieces inspired by this great writer&apos;s work. &quot;The Dunwitch Horror&quot;, of course, comes nowhere near the brilliance of films like those just mentioned, it is not even comparable to films like these, and it is certainly no classic, but while the film has its flaws, it is still an entertaining film that has its qualities.\n\nI will not go into detail regarding the plot, but, as usual for Lovecraft adapt ions, the Necronomicon, and the &apos;Old Ones&apos; play an important role. The quality of the performances differs. Sandra Dee, is sexy and nice to look at in the female lead, and she even reveals some of her charms, but her performance is quite awful. Dean Stockwell (who sports one of the most fake-looking mustaches in motion picture history) arguably delivers the best performance in the film, and the cast furthermore includes Sam Jaffe and the weird-looking Ed Begley (&quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, &quot;Hang &apos;Em High&quot;) in one of his last roles. Talia Shire also has a small role. The visual style is very much a matter of personal taste. The film has a nice general atmosphere and cool settings. The occasional flashy colors, in which the whole screen turns at some points, don&apos;t really fit in and annoy at times. The films greatest aspect is the excellent score by Les Baxter, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. The film has a brilliant animated opening credit sequence, which is another reason to give it a try. All things considered, &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; is certainly no great film, but even though it is quite cheesy and never really suspenseful it is yet a highly entertaining little film that I recommend to fans of occult fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Interesting movie based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell and professionally directed by Ang Lee . It deals with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull (Skeet Ulrich) , two friends living in Missouri when the Civil War bursts out . Jack Bull&apos;s dad is murdered by Jayhawkers , so the young men join the Bushwhackers to fight Union soldiers . Bushwhackers are irregulars loyal to the South led by Black John (Jim Caviezel) and the violent Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) , besides George Clyde (Simon Baker). One of them is an African-American , Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), beholden to the man who bought his freedom . They are a little-known band of Civil War fighters known as Bushwhackers . They skirmish then spend long hours hiding. Sue Lee (Jewel), a young widow , brings them supplies . She and Jack Bull become lovers and when he&apos;s grievously wounded , Jake escorts her south to a safe farm . Later on , there takes place the looting and burning of Lawrence , Kansas , actually occurred on 21 August 1863 also known as Quantrill&apos;s Raid . As his friends die one after another, Jake must decide where honor lies .\n\nExciting film based on historical events set during American Civil War (1861-1865) in which the Bushwhackers use guerrilla warfare to destroy Yankee targets and led by men set on revenge, make a raid into Kansas. The picture efficiently describes the atmosphere of violence in which Women and Blacks have few rights, confrontation among bands and bloody battles . Emotive and evocative musical score by Mychael Danna . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Frederick Elmes. Very good production design , including breathtaking attacks and battles ; the scenes of the Quantrill&apos;s Raid on Lawrence, Kansas were filmed in Pattonsburg, Missouri , Pattonsburg was flooded out during the great flood of 1993 and the town was relocated leaving many empty buildings and homes available . The motion picture was well directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback mountain , Sense and Sensibility , Hulk , Crouching tiger , hidden dragon). \n\nThe flick based on real deeds , these are the followings : The Lawrence Massacre, was a rebel guerrilla attack during the U.S. Civil War by Quantrill&apos;s Raiders, led by William Clarke Quantrill, on the pro-Union town of Lawrence, Kansas. The attack on August 21, 1863, targeted Lawrence due to the town&apos;s long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for Jayhawkers and Redlegs, which were free-state militia and vigilante groups known for attacking and destroying farms and plantations in Missouri&apos;s pro-slavery western counties .By 1863, Kansas had long been the center of strife and warfare over the admission of slave versus free states. In the summer of 1856, the first sacking of Lawrence sparked a guerrilla war in Kansas that lasted for months. John Brown might be the best known participant, but numerous groups fought for each side in Bleeding Kansas.By the beginning of the American Civil War, Lawrence, Kansas, was already a target for pro-slavery ire, having been seen as the anti-slavery stronghold in the state and more importantly, a staging area for Union and Jayhawker incursions into Missouri. Initially the town and surrounding area were extremely vigilant and reacted strongly to any rumors that enemy forces might be advancing on the town. However by the summer of 1863, as none of the threats had materialized, citizen fears had declined and defense preparations were relaxed.Quantrill himself said his motivation for the attack was, &quot;To plunder, and destroy the town in retaliation for Osceola. That was a reference to the Union&apos;s attack on Osceola, Missouri in September 1861, led by Senator James H. Lane.The attack was the product of careful planning. Quantrill had been able to gain the confidence of many of the leaders of independent Bushwhacker groups, and chose the day and time of the attack well in advance. The different groups of Missouri riders approached Lawrence from the east in several independent columns, and converged with well-timed precision in the final miles before Lawrence during the pre-dawn hours of the chosen day. Many of the men had been riding for over 24 hours to make the rendezvous and had lashed themselves to their saddles to keep riding if they fell asleep. Almost all were armed with multiple six-shot revolvers.Lawrence in ruins as illustrated in Harper&apos;s WeeklyBetween three and four hundred riders arrived at the summit of Mount Oread, then descended on Lawrence in a fury. Over four hours, the raiders pillaged and set fire to the town and killed most of its male population. Quantrill&apos;s men burned to the ground a quarter of the buildings in Lawrence, including all but two businesses. They looted most of the banks and stores and killed between 185 and 200 men and boys .",

I&apos;ve seen episodes of CHARMED that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie.\n\nIt has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived TV series no one has ever seen.

      "reviewBody": "Fun and Fancy Free is for me one of Disney&apos;s lesser efforts, but is still very charming, simple and enjoyable. I did think the live action sequences were dated though, and the film is quite short. Out of all the characters, the only character I didn&apos;t care for that much was the puppet. Apart from the hilarious &quot;well she used to be a good milker, but now... she is an udder failure&quot; he didn&apos;t really make an impact on me. Maybe it was because the ventriloquism was rather substandard.\n\nHowever, I really enjoyed this on the whole. The introduction with Jiminy Cricket- voiced by the one and only Cliff Edwards- in the library was very effective, as was a vast majority of the script. The animation is stunning, and by far the best aspect of the movie, and I hope I am not the only person who found the songs beautiful and memorable, my favourite being &quot;My what a happy day&quot;.\n\nThere are two mini-classics here, Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk. Both are wonderful gems, but I will admit I do prefer the latter. Bongo tells the rather simple story of the adorable Bongo and his endeavour into a world he has never known before, after being the star attraction of a circus. It is very sweet and well meaning, and the narration isn&apos;t so bad either. Mickey and the Beanstalk is a favourite of mine. Wonderful voice acting, terrific animation especially for the beanstalk and nice music made this memorable for me.\n\nOther things that impressed were one Jiminy Cricket of course, well how can he not impress, he is a classic character in the history of animation? Two, I thought Edgar Bergen was very entertaining in this film asides from the ventriloquism, and also child actress Luana Patten was impressive.\n\nAll in all, one of Disney&apos;s lesser efforts, but has undeniable charm due to the animated segments and Cricket himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Bongo, a circus bear, meets and falls in love with a girl bear named Lulubelle. But first he must confront a bear rival, Lumpjaw, whose looks match his name, before he wins her. When the story is completed, Jiminy finds he has been invited to ventriloquist Edgar Bergen&apos;s house where he is entertaining Luana Patten, Charlie McCarthy, and Mortimer Snerd. Bergen tells the story of Mickey and the Beanstalk, in which Mickey and his friends, Donald and Goofy, climb a beanstalk to rescue the lovely singing harp from a giant to restore happiness to their Happy Valley. As Bergen finishes the story, the giant appears, lifting the roof, in search of Mickey Mouse, then goes on down the hill toward Hollywood.",

The plot never really catches fire either; nor is the mystery all that engaging, but it&apos;s still mildly distracting, mainly due to some stylistic touches and bizarre POV shots - a character eating a carrot - from the inside of his mouth, Klaus Kinski playing a weird character who likes to kidnap and kiss snakes and a murderer known as The Snake picking off his victims using a dart gun dipped with venom. The second half is better than the first, but it&apos;s nothing remarkable.",

And, although I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a must see, I can understand why he must have believed he added something special when putting this one on his list.\n\nBenning spent 18 months shooting the Utah scenery from a fixed camera-position. The shots he used from all four seasons make for a nice viewing experience and gives it a timeless charm. While watching natures beauty a voice-over reads you a great number of mostly grim stories about the state from clashes between Native Americans and settlers all the way up to incidents with polygamous clans in recent times. The combination of images and sounds are to me a both awkward and fascinating mixture and make the movie worthwhile.\n\nAll in all, although not entertaining in a conventional, Hollywood kind of way, I found this movie both visually striking and historically interesting: a 6 /10 for me.",

Gordon (of &quot;Amazing Colossal Man&quot; fame), this was one pretty much cut from the same bolt: huge creatures mutated by atomic radiation, really cheesy special effects (even by &apos;50&apos;s sci-fi movie standards), loud pompous music, handsome dashing hero, pert, perky blonde heroine, etc.\n\nThis movie may not have Glenn Langan (or even William Hudson for that matter), it does have Peter Graves, which more than makes up for any Glennlessness.  (Both movies have Hank Patterson, by the way).\n\nOverall, this is an OK movie, given its time and genre; the really bad special effects previously alluded to will make you smile, and the mellow take-charge presence of Peter Graves will leave you feeling warm and secure - sort like you used to when you fel asleep in the back seat of you parents&apos; car on long trips while Mom and Dad sat up front, taking care of everything.\n\nAaaahhhhh, now if they&apos;d only turn down that music."

This is the kind of movie that lifts the mood up and always keeps us guessing &quot;what&apos;s next?&quot;. \n\nThis is the kind of movie Mel Gibson is best at and he should have always done this kind of movies. This movie will definitely gather him younger fans throughout the world. It is a new blend of action,crime and drama.\n\nAdrian Grunberg is the kind of director who can stylize the crimes in his movies. He shows us there are more colors in crime-action movies other than red. \n\nIf you want to have a good time and have been missing crime oriented fast action movies for a while, this is the movie you are looking for. 7 out of 10.\n\nBottom line: Not to be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "Review: I thought that this was quite an emotional and mystical movie with great acting by the cast, especially the little boy who was really convincing in his role. The film has a real Disney feel to it, with the whole feel good factor along with being a right tear jerker. You really grow to care about the family and there emotional turmoil. The storyline was well put together by the director, but it does seem to move at a slow pace. In all, I think there is something for everyone in this film and you can&apos;t help but feel a bit tears, although the storyline is prettY far fetched. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up: For an Australian actor, Joel Edgerton is really starting to get some versatile roles such as The Thing, The Warrior and even a part in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. I&apos;m not a big fan of Jennifer Garner, but she was perfect picked for this role. The kid is the character that really shines in this movie and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we see him on screen more after his part in this movie. It was a bit strange to see Common in a movie like this and its always good to see David Morse who has stopped acting as much as he did. I just hope that people get to see this mysterious tale which will touch your heart.\n\nBudget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $52million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there mystical, mysterious drama movies about a couple trying to have a child. 6/10",

Quite simply, this is an extremely entertaining movie for hardcore and casual fans of the character or anyone looking to spend 90 minutes witnessing pure, albeit silly, celluloid joy. The new movie is certainly more &quot;mature&quot; in it&apos;s telling compared to the original series and such beloved updates as Ultraman Tiga. There is a good amount of character development and some actual drama to be found. The action sequences are handled remarkably well and the final confrontation between Ultraman and his nemesis is a wonder to behold. The CG is quite good and blends real well with the more practical visual effects. The only real nitpick I had with the film is the theme sounded a bit too much like the &quot;Top Gun&quot; theme and &quot;Top Gun&quot; is not one of my favorite films. I heartily recommend Ultraman! Seek it out at all costs!",

If it&apos;s not zombies, who&apos;s only zombie like aspect is alka-seltzer driven mouth foam, it&apos;s seemingly omniscience beef patties that attack the characters in-mass.

But, that is only the commentary track by director Gionata Zarantonello, who indeed made a masterpiece that shows many times it&apos;s budget. Through his innovative way of shooting, using his actors and making use of the extraordinary locations he created a beautiful dreamlike film that takes the viewer away to a horrifying world of violence and abuse that everybody who has had a less-than-ideal time in school will immediately recognize. This seems to be sounding a bit paradoxical, but in the terrors shown and old wounds being ripped open again the recognition of someone in far away Italy showing exactly all these things you were never able to explain satisfyingly to anyone in such beautiful images makes for one of the finest cinematic experiences I ever encountered.",

Both films are based on Zola´s story, and, obviously, the merit is Renoir´s, since his version is much better. The psychological and deep meaning beneath the coolness of the main character (Jacques Lantier, in a Gabin memorable performance) is handled superbly; so is his troubled relation with Simone´s character. Despite some boring shots, the photography and screenplay are gems, and &quot;Bete Humaine&quot; ends up being a great addition to Renoir´s filmography. I love him; &quot;La Grande Ilusion&quot; and &quot;La Regle du Jeu&quot; are two of my favorite films; a masterful storyteller and a curious observer of the human soul. A humanist.",

Watching this film was like a history lesson of sorts. The music was great, good vintage rock n&apos; roll from bands like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, X, etc. It seemed to me that with this film, Penelope Spheeris was trying to show people that these weren&apos;t all just stupid kids who were out to do drugs and kill people. Some of these punks really had some philosophies that they were working at behind their music. This seems most evident in the interview with Black Flag. I understand myself how a lot of people might view these bands&apos; philosophies as under-developed and simple, but one must take into account that these were some pretty young people. Nowadays, as young as I still am, I find it refreshing to run into someone my age who understands in any way philosophical thinking. In this movie, the young people may seem a little half-baked in their philosophies, but you might keep in mind that most kids don&apos;t even get that far. I&apos;ve met many full-grown adults who have not progressed as far with deep thought contexts as some of the punk musicians in &quot;Decline&quot;. Another thing I loved about this movie was how funny it got at times. Some of these kids were total idiots, while the story about the dead painter was devilishly humorous. Fear&apos;s performance at the end topped it all. Even if punk is dead, it was once very alive. All flaws aside, &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; was made for people who can tell the difference between some suburban wimp with a mohawk and the truly intelligent individuals who were genuinely upset and picked up music instruments as weapons against the forces of the corporate."

      "reviewBody": "The Mummy&apos;s Shroud is far from an awful film, I&apos;ve yet to see an unwatchable Hammer film, even their lesser work. It is however an uneven film, with a number of strengths and an even number of big weaknesses, and one of Hammer&apos;s least accomplished.\n\nIt looks good, some of the editing lacks tightness sometimes and the Mummy effects are not very good, but the photography is solid and often wonderful especially in the final thirty minutes, the lighting is suitably eerie and the sets give a sense of time and place very well while also looking great. The music score thunders thrillingly and doesn&apos;t feel stock and over-bearing, fitting with the atmosphere appropriately. The murders are inventive and quite grisly, while the first murder is the one with the most punch the most memorable being Longbarrow&apos;s. While the best The Mummy&apos;s Shroud gets is the final thirty minutes, which is very entertaining and legitimately scary.\n\nCasting and acting-wise, it is a rather mixed bag with a few coming off well. The best performance comes from Michael Ripper, I appreciated that his role was more substantial in comparison to some of his other roles, and he is excellent in it, the tragic nature of the character Longbarrow was so poignantly done and had such pathos that it was easy to feel sympathy for him. John Phillips also stands out as a suitably loathsome villain, while Barbara Sellars matches him more than ideally; the interplay between Phillips is very effectively played by both. David Buck is an appealing hero. Catherine Lacey tries too hard sometimes, but it is clear that she was having fun and she is enjoyable to fun as one of the film&apos;s more colourful characters.\n\nOthers don&apos;t fare so well. Roger Delgardo has a tendency to over-compensate, that it takes one out of the film, his tongue-in-cheek comedic nature too much out of place. Andre Morell was a reliable actor but is completely wasted, no matter how hard he tried to give some serious depth to his character. As truly attractive Maggie Kimberly looks, her acting is very over-theatrical and melodramatic and it does hurt the film sometimes. Lastly the Mummy of the title is badly disadvantaged by the truly laughable and fake look it has(the Egyptians in the opening sequence are also very poorly made up), its far too late and far too short screen time and Eddie Powell&apos;s(even more lumbering and anaemic than the worst of Lon Chaney Jnr&apos;s interpretation) emotionless and un-menacing performance.\n\nThe film takes far too long to get going, with an overlong(did it really need to be seven minutes?) and not always relevant opening scene, with the back-story rather unnecessary. Despite the distinguished delivery, the narration was not really needed, and it should have been a case of more show less tell. The script is very stiff and rambling, with a lot of talk that doesn&apos;t do anywhere. The first half is also let down by its draggy pacing, noticeable lack of suspense and horror and a very over-familiar story with a few subplots that either lead nowhere, add little or both.\n\nAll in all, an uneven film and one of Hammer&apos;s lesser and least accomplished films, but by all means watchable, especially for the final thirty minutes and Ripper&apos;s performance. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

The anthropomorphism of the dog, &apos;Dennis&apos; is a superb &apos;observation&apos; by the writer. Biscuits, sex and someone at the door, are priceless.\n\nIt&apos;s fast moving and never dull! The aliens, voiced by some of the Monty Python team, are really good, especially the choice of names when they start speaking in English.\n\nI was slightly disappointed that &apos;Neil&apos; never recognised that &apos;Catherine&apos; liked him for who he was, there were plenty of clues!\n\nI laughed a lot and will definitely see it again.",

      "reviewBody": "Antigone represents the epitome of philosophical thought in antiquity. The ruler in Creon is set opposite to the loyal sister in Antigone. The ethical dilemma presented in the film is much like Plato&apos;s works: Euthyphro and Republic. Creon, as the ruler Thebes, thinks it just to not bury the fallen enemies near the city as it would disgrace the city. Antigone on the other hand feels it just to her fallen brother, a confederate to the previous regime, that he be given a proper burial in regard to his and Antigone&apos;s beliefs in the Gods. \n\nThe conflict gets its genesis from a varying view of what is just or the right thing to do. Take Plato&apos;s dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro in Euthyphro. Euthyphro explains to Socrates that something pious (just, good) is something unanimously loved by the Gods. Socrates raises the question as to whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious or whether something pious is only pious because it is loved by the gods. The circular dilemma present by Euthyphro brings a question to Antigone. Is she right for wanting her brother buried and disrupting edicts by Creon&apos;s rule? Is her pious belief in the Gods something she ought to uphold? Does the good or justice in her brother&apos;s burial supersede Creon&apos;s rule? Additionally, in Plato&apos;s Republic Thraseymachus explains to Socrates that the just is the advantage of the stronger, and that it is just to obey one&apos;s rulers. Socrates argues against this conclusion but with weak premises. For Euthyphro, Antigone would be justified in wanting her brother buried in his religious fashion which would dictate his corpse not rotting in the woods. Thraseymachus on the other hand would say that the justice resides in the ruler, Creon, for better or worse. Which is right?",

Reluctant in the beginning of the treatment, he gets confidence in Dr. Davenport and discloses his childhood, revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love for each other. Resolving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true familial drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life. The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent, making sensitive, attractive and with good taste, a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, it might be a very heavy story. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;Voltando a Viver&apos; (&apos;Returning to Live&apos;)",

And this movie gives much, too much, question after question, where no answer is absolute. It is movie about The Life, about the wish to live and about the fear of it. It describes the life of some young Sowjets before the break of the Nazi invasion, where the Sowjet presence is depicted with the real touch of emotions. As a typical Sowjet (Russian) movie the feeling and the play of the actors dominates, but because of the confrontation between young and old, in between the young ones and the old ones, there is no single cadre, which gives me a second of time to relax and I jump form one personage into another. I think that it is amazing how this feeling drama, succeed to overcome the tragedy of the situation, of its fearful environment and to glorify the Human. Somehow there is no trail of judgment, but the actors&apos; play resolve it in the endless search for happiness of their personages. There many strong movies showing what human do to other human, this movie shows us what one can do to it self. Just the end is a bit of pathetic, but it is the true end, unfortunately, where the unification is matter of the death.",

It is a difficult film to watch at times, and it does take a while for the film to get going.\n\nI&apos;m not going to put in any spoilers but if you do not want to know anything at all about the film please just accept that it is worth it and stop reading.\n\nIm trying not to sound to geeky but imagine if David Mamet (glengarry glen ross, Ronin) wrote for chan Wook Park (old boy, lady vengeance) and you would know what I mean.\n\nOK, so half an hour into the film I thought it was just another murder film, but it really is so much more.\n\nIt is not perfect by any means. the police seem clumsy at times and the film gel as well as it could, but this is all for a reason, and that reason is shown in the 20 minute finale which is better than anything Hollywood can do. It is the type of ending that has you literally hiding behind a cushion one minute, then jumping up and cheering the next.\n\nIf you liked lady vengeance or dark water, this is a film for you, if you like good cinema that makes you think then again this is a good movie for you.\n\nPark may be the fashionable director at the moment, and rightly so if you have seen his films, but Eun-jin Bang who directed this film is definitely one to look out for. Also, you should watch this before Hollywood remakes it, which no doubt it will at some point.\n\nI just liked the movie, and I hope more people give it a go.",

      "reviewBody": "When I went to see this, I expected one of those progressive stories like he was getting ditched and as he went and surprised them things got better, they had laughs and things were healed sort of typical thing. But it definitely didn&apos;t go down like that. There were about maybe 8 people in the theater when I went to see this movie, 3 of them were me and my 2 friends.\n\nI have to say this movie was really sad and had a lot to say about child/parent relations. I am only 18 years old but I love these types of films and it made me think about how I would be with my parents when I get older and it really makes me want to make sure I keep a good relationship with my parents. My dad has always pushed me and wanted better for me in school and I have always been very average and against the grain, as it seems like David was.\n\nI don&apos;t know if the makers wanted the relation between Frank and his kids to seem empty, but that&apos;s how it seemed to be throughout the film until the end. Even if it was lack of chemistry between actors, which of course I highly doubt it was, it works wonders and shows that Frank is like an alien to them and also that they are alien to him. When he learns that all of his children aren&apos;t actually as successful, he seems like he&apos;s struggling within to try and understand where they&apos;re coming from instead of just showing his disappointment. When things finally come tumbling down towards the film&apos;s climax, they come right back together as a family would. This movie made me tear up and really the only reason I didn&apos;t cry was because I was with friends. \n\nI could write a lot more about this but I&apos;ll just suggest that if you&apos;re looking for a good movie about family, or even if you just like De Niro(that&apos;s why I saw it), you should definitely see this movie. It won&apos;t disappoint.",

It is a lot better than his first, &quot;Eat my Dust&quot;, but it still isn&apos;t the best. The plot is that a girl runs away to Las Vegas with a guy she likes, and is being Chased down by her parents, a jealous lover, cops, and many other randos trying to collect a bounty on them. The script writing wasn&apos;t the best. It starts off good enough, then downgraded to just being jam packed with stuff, and by stuff I mean excuses to put car crashes and stunts. The car action was really nice, but it gets old after a while. Near the end, a lot of sense in writing and direction is lost, rather just being cars mindlessly crashing into each other. There are some pros to the script, as every once in a while you&apos;ll get a funny joke. The the cast of characters participating in the chase Aren&apos;t the best people. They aren&apos;t really fleshed out, and there&apos;s way too many of them. By the end, over 20 people are chasing and racing against each other, and after a while I just stopped keeping track of them. The acting saved this film a bit. Overall, a wild car action comedy, jam packed with cars, crashes, and explosions.",

      "reviewBody": "Found the first &apos;Nativity!&apos; film enjoyable for what it was. It was nothing mind-blowing, but achieved what it set out to do well and didn&apos;t try to be any more than it was. The same goes with its inferior but not that bad sequel &apos;Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger&apos;.\n\n&apos;Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger&apos; is easier to criticise and is far from a great film, or at least to me that was the case. Am not going to resort to spouting the ridiculous and untrue &quot;it&apos;s a kids film&quot; excuse, especially considering that it&apos;s a family film not a kids one so adults are more than entitled to judge. Plus coming from somebody who loves Christmas and a lot of festive films it is pretty condescending and immature to accuse those who didn&apos;t like it as much of being a scrooge. With that being said it will appeal to children, who are very likely to love it, while being more divisive by adult standards. \n\nIt is easy to see why &apos;Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger&apos; has been criticised. The story is very silly and formulaic, even by younger viewer standards. It also suffers at times from pacing issues, some parts are too hectic and then other parts lose momentum and drag, including the once again over-extended finale. \n\nThe improvisatory nature of the script is not always as natural this time round, some awkward moments, and there is a tendency for the schmaltz to go too over-the-top and sickeningly twee. Marc Wooton was a scene stealer in the first &apos;Nativity!&apos; film, here he wildly overplays and it is largely to do with how the character is written.\n\nHowever, David Tennant is a very game replacement for Martin Freeman and Pam Ferris as ever is splendid. Up-staging them, and the best thing about the film, are the children, once again so easy in presence and with such great comic timing and individuality.\n\n&apos;Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger&apos; looks nice enough in its own simple, un-flashy way. The music is very catchy and gives a real sense of Christmas and there is a nice spirit in the scenes where the pacing doesn&apos;t hinder it. The film does have a warm heart and sweet well-intentioned charm, along with some amusing, if not as sparkling as before, comic elements.\n\nOverall, not great but not that bad. It&apos;s slightly above &quot;on the fence&quot; for me. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Years ago, in the primitive days of 1980s VHS, Blockbuster Video routinely cobbled together respectable arthouse films and C and D-grade exploitation pictures to comprise its &quot;Foreign&quot; section. Gianfranco Angelucci&apos;s &apos;Honey&apos; falls into the latter camp. For years, it was only available in a poorly dubbed, pan-and-scan VHS version, with a truncated runtime and an alluring picture on the back of nude Clio Goldsmith climbing into a Victorian bathtub, in a bizarre room walled with stacks of cotton - and they circulated this cassette at many Blockbuster locations. If memory serves, Media Video distributed it.\n\nMore recently, a European blu-ray firm decided to remaster the picture in 4k and issue it in letterbox, subtitled, with its full runtime - so I got my hands on a copy, eager to check it out again, and suspecting that the excisions from the movie could account for the mediocrity and/or lack of clarity.\n\nNo such luck. I&apos;m afraid the restoration didn&apos;t help matters. This is a murky, dull, unfocused picture, apparently intended as scintillating and erotic, a kind of softcore Alice in Wonderland, but boring as hell. It has several gauzy smoker-calibre love scenes (including female-on-female foreplay, shot through the latticework of a boudoir screen in the said bathroom, and voyeurism courtesy of a bedroom mirror), clumsy attempts at bawdy humor, cheap production design, a grating and drippy score, and a story that travels absolutely nowhere in a hurry. There are also sleazy touches throughout, such as a dildo-shaped remote lightswitch, that add nothing other than crude yuks; watching this is like playing &quot;where&apos;s Waldo&quot; to find the perverse easter eggs. Goldsmith (then the future sister-in-law of Queen Camilla Parker-Bowles) was gorgeous, to be certain, and the movie benefits from a semi-intriguing framing story, with the gifted Buñuel vet Fernando Rey as a harried, victimized book publisher. Otherwise, this is a Eurotrash-stuffed frozen turkey.\n\nGiven a little more skill, intelligence and taste, the creators might have produced something along the lines of the original Emmanuelle, but anyone who expects that degree of sophistication or sexiness will feel sorely disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "In fact I was out to find the French movie &quot;Mutants&quot; but ran into this stinker on Blu Ray for a few euro&apos;s, new I mean. Cover looked okay, indeed a mutant reflecting in the glasses of a gas mask. Two names on it, Steven Bauer and Michael Ironside. Two famous names. First research, it&apos;s also called &quot;Zombie Mutants&quot; in Germany. Again, so far so good. But naturally, names and a DVD or Blu Ray sleeve doesn&apos;t make a good feature. And this is a perfect example. First of all, once the flick was over I thought, hell, where were those zombies? Secondly I thought, Jesus, I forgot to get scared. You can see it coming, bad as hell. Sadly not bad that it became good. It&apos;s watchable as a TV movie but to categorize it under horror, no way. The effects used are laughable. You can easily see that the infection on the skin is just add on the flesh. The mutants once they attack are just targets to be shot. Just look at it, once they are clearing the laboratory and the sugar plantation were all the experiments are being done you are just watching a game, shoot every mutant popping up. It&apos;s really boring because there&apos;s no suspense by doing that. Otherwise, some actors get shot but after 5 minutes they are walking around without any pain or limitations. And the shot wounds just look like a scratch. The best part was when Ironside is confronted with one of his friends trying to get him killed. But I must say, he&apos;s in real life getting old. I have met him twice at conventions and you could easily see him ageing. But the worst thing was when they showed one of the mutants transforming in a creature was done by CGI and one of the cheap ones. One explosion was also CGI, the flames were CGI, and it came up to me to state CGwhy? It wouldn&apos;t even fit into exploitation. No this was just a waste of time, I did it, no you don&apos;t do it. Go watch the French Mutant.",

      "reviewBody": "The real, angry Chris Rock doesn&apos;t put in an appearance until the final moments of this political satire (directed and co-written by Rock) but it&apos;s not enough to rescue what has come before. Rock&apos;s fantasy of being the first African-American to achieve the White House (although he&apos;s initially set up to fail by spin doctors Dylan Baker and a surprisingly funny Lynn Whitfield) is somewhat toothless by Rock&apos;s own standards. The problem is his altered perception of himself as a film star (as opposed to the established HBO black equivalent of Dennis Miller): he phonily positions himself from the onset as cuddly, concerned for the constituents of the ward he&apos;s an alderman for and reasonably ignorant of national issues; he&apos;s finally allowed to become self-aware only when his older brother (the always welcome Bernie Mac) intercedes. You keep waiting for Rock to change but when he does, it&apos;s first into a playa that comes up with glib quips in response to standard questions. (With barely a mention of foreign policy, they seem a bit stale). Only in the final debate against his opponent (Nick Searcy) does he let loose with some honesty and only then do the jokes carry some weight. Rock, making his directorial debut, opts for the equivalent of a made-for-TV movie with a flat look, very mild gags (there are not nearly enough white fright jokes but there is a fundraiser that turns into a dance party with elderly WASPs doing the electric slide, and opening credits that state Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, George Bush and Hillary Clinton, among others, `are not in this movie&apos;) and very little interest in being taken seriously. Warren Beatty covered this turf far more handily in `Bulworth&apos;. With Tamala Jones as his love interest, Robin Givens (cleverly cast as a gold digger) and, unfortunately, only a couple of bits from Tracy Morgan.",

      "reviewBody": "It would not be surprising if some day a film school professor chose &apos;También la lluvia&apos; to illustrate a course about committed pictures, for this Spanish-Mexican co-production is indeed a model of its kind. \n\nIntelligently written by Paul Laverty (Ken Loach&apos;s regular collaborator since 1996) and competently helmed by Icíar Bollaín (a Spanish actress turned director and, incidentally, Laverty&apos;s life companion), &apos;También la lluvia&apos; examines a social and political event that took place in Bolivia in 2000, the Water War, when an American Water Company tried to privatize the drinking water service in the town of Corachamba, implying a tariff raise in an order from 40% to 300%.\n\nTo tell his story, the writer could have adopted the committed filmmaker&apos;s standard approach: «display of injustice/negative impact on the group concerned/reaction of the most militant/confrontation/resolution of the conflict». Instead, he imagined the coming of a film crew shooting a movie in the surroundings of Carachambo, getting involved gradually– and against their will - in the troubles affecting Corachamba. So do the viewers, who identify with them without having the feeling they are being manipulated by the authors.\n\nSuch a concept also gives &apos;También la lluvia&apos; added value, making it function on several levels. It enables Laverty to: - inform his audiences about a little known historical event - unveil a hidden chapter of history (through the subject of the film shot within the film: the first opponents to the Conquistadores, Jesuits Bartolomé de las Casas and Antonio de Montesinos) - have the two stories echo each other and enrich each other - cast a spotlight on Bolivia, a neglected country, and on its Indian population - depict complex characters (the more idealistic ones shying away from direct action when confronted to danger while the more reactionary display unexpected bravery)\n\nHelped by Iciar Bollain&apos;s sure-handed direction and by the excellence of the cast (Gabriel Garcia Bernal as Sébastián, the tormented director ; Luis Tosar as the cynical producer ; Karra Elejalde, impressive as the provocative star of the film in progress ; and - the revelation of the film, - the amazing Juan Carlos Aduviri, who inhabits his role as the Indian actor/activist Daniel), Paul Laverty manages to teach, move and entertain, while avoiding dogmatism, bias and over-simplification. Just what he is accused of by the flock of bleating French film critics.",

My friend invited me to go as it was filmed in the area so I thought it would be fun as not much gets shot around here. I didn&apos;t know anything about the movie only that it starred the blonde chick from Wrong Turn 2.\n\nThe movie wasn&apos;t 100% completed but that didn&apos;t bother me much. The film follows a woman (Erica Leersen) when she travels back to her hometown to try and find out what happened to her brother and other people that have disappeared in the area.\n\nThe film opens with a great scene. Very exciting and really grabs you from the start! The acting is especially good! Kudos to Miss Leersen who was fantastic in her role of Michelle. There are some great stand out scenes in the film with her. I really liked the drama aspect to the film. There is some emotional scenes in the film such as the ones with Michelle and her Mom who is in a nursing home suffering from Alzeimers. Also very good in the film was Ben who plays Michelle&apos;s friend and the actor that played Joe was very creepy.\n\nI really liked the cinematography which is really impressive towards the end of the movie. Speaking of the end of the movie - Wow! I really would like to talk about the ending but seeing as the films not been released yet I&apos;m going to keep quiet. All I&apos;m going to say is that the ending was AWESOME! I kinda got a bit bored 3/4 way into the movie but things quickly changed! So I highly recommend this film to everyone! Horror fans will really dig this but it will appeal to a lot of other people too. It has a great story and amazing ending! Erica fans will not want to miss this!",

It&apos;s a pale imitation of &quot;The Manchurian candidate&quot; with a little bit of &quot;Total recall&quot; thrown in. I strongly suggest that you should watch those movies. If you have already seen them , then watch them again. Just don&apos;t waste your time on &quot;Fugitive mind&quot;.\n\nThe story allows Michael Dudikoff (&quot;American ninja&quot;) to do a bit more acting that he has in the past. Dudikoff has always been a capable B actor and he proves it here. He isn&apos;t able to save the movie , because the plot sucks. The story is predictable and the action is terribly lame. The movie drags almost all the time and I was fast-forwarding it at few places. You won&apos;t be satisfied either if you&apos;re a thriller or action movie fan. It&apos;s a cheaply made movie that will satisfy only the most desperate and tasteless viewers. This is lame movie that isn&apos;t even &quot;so bad , it&apos;s good&quot;. Don&apos;t waste your time. If you like Dudikoff better watch &quot;American ninja&quot; or &quot;Avenging force&quot;. I give it 1/10.",

There&apos;s no analysis of the finances or logic of fashion; no discussion of Vogue&apos;s rivals; or any attempt to debunk the myth of Wintour as ice-queen. Maybe this is because the myth is reality; but there&apos;s also a strong sense that director R. J. Cutler hasn&apos;t tried very hard, that he had his story before he started and was quite happy to shoot it deferentially. Wintour herself provides few real clues in some unrevealing interviews, and while she is plainly tough, she glides through an affluent world apparently insulated from anyone in whose interests it might be to answer her back, so it&apos;s a limited sort of toughness. Certainly Cutler doesn&apos;t challenge her; and his film, though watchable, ultimately has very little to say.",

Intriguing performances and slightly surreal situations make the film well worth the watch. Coogan is delightfully flawed and the surrounding cast truly resonates. Although I was prepared to be distracted by Hilary Duff, I thought she shined brightly and held her own quite well. The truth is that most filmmakers when tackling tougher issues as ones presented in What Goes Up tend to talk down and diminish their audience while the makers of this film seem undaunted by the regular Hollywood mission of going for cheap humor and glamorized sexuality. There is a gravity here that hangs like a thick cloud over this cast and I suspect this movie will be looked upon later as having more layers than it would initially seem.",

But since the previous one is a really nice movie, funny, light, original and really well done, I was expecting definitely more from this second one! The stories are very predictable and with foregone solution. The characters have the same roles as in the first one, the stories are exactly the same! The only difference is the time of the setting, 2006 instead of the 80&apos;s. One thing that really surprised me it&apos;s the amount of meaningless nude scenes inside the movie... I mean, it&apos;s a pleasure for a men to watch naked women =) But it seemed to me that they ruined this movie further on. Compared to the first one, this movie lost the freshness and the originality. Of course it makes you laugh, but it&apos;s a movie as many others, an American Pie style movie... Another Cinepanettone",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Fishing-Girl of Bodensee&apos; is a weak movie, but it&apos;s an excellent example of &apos;Heimatfilm&apos;, a genre unique to the German-speaking world. &apos;Heimat&apos; is the German word for &apos;country&apos; or &apos;homeland&apos;. Heimatfilmen feature stories that take place largely outdoors, emphasising the countryside of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There is usually a young heroine who somehow embodies the spirit of the land. Nature is celebrated, specifically Germanic nature.\n\nMaria, a poor orphan, lives with her grandfather Grassl in a remote fishing hut on the shore of Bodensee, where she ekes out an existence with her fishing-lines. Her mother is long dead, and the identity of her father is unknown. (Heimatfilmen were not usually this honest about such things.) The nearest neighbours are the Bruckbergers, who are wealthy ... in fact, the Bruckberger daughters have a motorboat, which scares away the fish Maria needs to catch for her livelihood. But Karl Bruckberger also has a handsome young son, Hans. Guess what happens.\n\nThis movie is by the numbers. It does, however, benefit from some beautiful German scenery, photographed in exquisite colour. Unfortunately, most Heimatfilmen (including this one) were more concerned with beautiful scenery than with interesting stories. But most of the actresses in this movie are quite pleasant to look at. I would call them splendid examples of Aryan womanhood, but then somebody might get the wrong idea. I&apos;ll rate this rustic romance 4 out of 10.",

Paul Weitz has a great and creative imagination to think up the plot of &quot;American Dreamz,&quot; a 2006 comedy that he wrote and directed.\n\nThe premise is that the President of the U.S. (Dennis Quaid) is the puppet of his chief adviser (Willem Dafoe) and has to have an earpiece so he knows what to say. At the beginning of the film, he&apos;s reading newspapers and discovering that things in the world aren&apos;t quite as they&apos;ve been described to him. So absorbed is he in this new knowledge, that he won&apos;t leave the residence, and rumors surface that he&apos;s had a nervous breakdown or is ill. So his Chief of Staff mounts a massive publicity campaign, and one of the things he does is arrange for the President to judge the &quot;American Dreamz&quot; talent contest. Hugh Grant is the Simon Cowell character who also hosts the show. He wants a Jew and an Arab to compete, plus someone really yummy (Mandy Moore).\n\nAn idiot terrorist, Iqbal Riza (Tony Yalda) is sent to the U.S. to get him out of the way, and he lives with his cousins. His goal in life is to be on American Dreamz. However, the day the Dreamz committee arrives in response to his tape, his terrorist cousin Omer (Sam Golzali) is in his stage/basement setup doing a song from Guys and Dolls. He&apos;s scooped up for American Dreamz, which makes Iqbal a) furious and b) his choreographer. The terrorist bosses devise a bomb that Omer will retrieve in the mens room to kill himself and the President - but he has to get to the final round.\n\nThis comedy is truly outrageous. I just wish we could have seen a few more numbers from Omer and his cousin - for me, the competition just made the movie. In my opinion also, it would have been funnier if the Mandy Moore character of Sally Kendoo had been below par - she actually was pretty good. When Omer went into &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; and one of the terrorists criticizes the choice of song to his fellow cell members, it was hilarious.\n\nIt is incredibly nervy to show terrorists assembling pieces of a bomb for Omer to put together and juxtapose it with a mindless competition - nervy because it&apos;s the old Hitchcock terror in normal places idea that is scary indeed.\n\nAfter all Omer has been told about the evils in America, it must seem like a pretty silly place to him - but tempting - and he goes after the American Dream on American Dreamz. Sally Kendoo, looking for all the world like an innocent hometown girl, is anything but, as ruthless as they come, even taking advantage of an Iraqui vet she doesn&apos;t love to pull in audience votes. Grant is appropriately sleazy as Martin Tweed, Quaid good as an out of it President just finding his own voice, and Marcia Gay Harden has a small but colorful role as the First Lady.\n\nMost of the characters are sketchy and not likable - except for Omer and his cousin, who are a riot. If only real young terrorists were the way these two are depicted.",

The older brother who is finally facing the future, Rick tries to develop a new life while still taking care of his circle of strays. He rebels from his sex-filled nights against Salvatore, a womanizing freeloader and his drug-providing past with Fred, his not so bright cousin. Their unending loyalty keeps the &quot;family&quot; strong, even when he falls in love with a midwestern outsider, Heather. Perceptive and extremely witty writing keeps the pace throughout the film, and his chemistry with tony, played beautifully by f valentino morales, is worth the price of the ticket alone.\n\ngood film. Vin Diesel&apos;s script is tight and authentic, while his directing is effective: repeatedly coaxing impressive performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. tony &amp; fred Good Performers Vin&apos;s own performance here is a revelation the likes of which he sought to recapture in the unexciting Sidney Lumet courtroom drama Find Me Guilty.

The last 30 minutes of so makes up for the whole movie and for me made it worth watching to the end.\n\nReally good performances from Zohra Lampert and Mariclare Costello, neither of whom I had never heard of until I watched this. The rest of the actors are a bit wooden, but that could easily be blamed on the script and dialogue.\n\nThe really great thing about this movie is that the ending is completely open to interpretation.  Did it all happen or was it all the imagination of a really messed up mind?\n\nIf you don&apos;t mind old movies with low production values this is one worth watching.\n\nAn easy 7/10 for me, well worth the 90 minutes.",

Superbly directed by Clarence Brown, who brings the same &quot;children&apos;s book&quot; ambiance to the project as he did with &quot;National Velvet&quot;. Well-acted and stunningly photographed on location (by Leonard Smith and Charles Rosher, who won Oscars). Young Claude Jarman, Jr. becomes attached to a troublesome baby deer, and his teary devotion is quite heart-rending. Some of the dialogue is fearsome, and, yes, it&apos;s a corny picture in an old-fashioned vein, however it is certainly worth-seeing, even for cynics. *** from ****",

      "reviewBody": "Although the plot didn&apos;t sound that special, with it being quite old hat and predictable, there were a couple of interest points. Namely the cast, being somebody who has liked very much a lot of the work of Joan Crawford and Clark Gable individually and Robert Montgomery is good when in the right role. Not to mention Charles Butterworth, Rosalind Russell and Billie Burke. WS Van Dyke was a very talented director who was hardly out of his depth in this sort of film and golden age comedy with touches of romance are my kind of film.\n\n&apos;Forsaking All Others&apos; is not one of the best of the genre. Have also seen everybody in the cast give better performances than here, though they do come off very well still and are the main reason for seeing the film. &apos;Forsaking All Others&apos; is one of those films that starts off very well but runs out of steam in the latter stages in material and momentum. It is certainly not a bad film, let alone terrible, but considering the talent it had potential to be much better.\n\nBeginning with the good, it looks good with some lovely shots and Crawford&apos;s typically knockout wardrobe. Van Dyke&apos;s direction is slick and accomplished for the first half. Really liked the song choices for the soundtrack, some real classics here and all used appropriately and it was surprising to hear a few of the songs sung by the cast a capella. The script is very witty and sophisticated in the first half and is also very funny.\n\nThe first half also moves at a lively pace and has fun and charm. Crawford clearly enjoys herself while not playing her role too heavily, which she did do in some of her comedies, and has nice comic timing. Gable despite being underused later is charming and dashing, didn&apos;t like how his character was written in the second half but Gable really makes the most of what he is given. Montgomery also has great comic timing and is suitably caddish, though again his character didn&apos;t appeal to me. Butterworth and Russell are very amusing.\n\nHowever, &apos;Forsaking All Others&apos; could have been better. The second half for me was not near as good as the first, it drags in pace, any turns are predictable and the material becomes tired and contrived. It actually felt like a different film. The ending comes over as hokey and would have made more sense and rang true if Gable&apos;s character was written better in the second half and didn&apos;t make such an unwarranted and out of the blue decision.\n\nThe character does come over as simpering and too easily fooled and Montgomery&apos;s character&apos;s negative character traits are also overblown to the extent that his appeal gets lost on the viewer. Van Dyke&apos;s direction also isn&apos;t as focused and it was like he lost control or gave up. Burke has too little to do to shine.\n\nIn conclusion, uneven but just about above average. 6/10.",

Juliette Binoche, in her pre-The English Patient role, was as gorgeous and subtle as ever. The thing about this movie though that it&apos;s billed as a romance but you don&apos;t see it anywhere but just hints of it and feel the sexual tensions between the 2 main characters. Rather disappointing for some but it&apos;s that exact same formula which makes it such a beautiful movie to watch. To top it off, it was filmed in the French countryside which is so breathtaking that you could just watch the movie for the cinematography alone. All in all, it&apos;s a superb movie in the tradition of finely crafted French costume dramas."

      "reviewBody": "The acting of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ulmann is absolutely spell binding and while Katherine Hepburn may have been accused of portraying the emotions for A to B there is no doubt that these two actors can portray the emotions from A to Z and beyond.  When I watch a film in a foreign language I find myself studying facial expressions and body language very closely, not surprisingly as, with the lack of understanding I am more dependant of visual cues. However such scrutiny often uncovers failings and weaknesses  not here.\n\nThe cinematography id also first class, the colours, tones and lighting are all superb and enhance, never detract.\n\nThis is only the second of Bergman&apos;s films I have seen (the first being Fanny and Alexander) and what I have noticed is that while many films give to the viewer and I feel as if the emotions are a natural response, I felt with the Bergman films, particularly this one, as if the films have taken something out of me, as if the emotions have been extracted against my will. This may sound over the top and rather florid but is a genuine statement. I also have to say that what the two films have in common is that they were both spellbinding and like a good book that just can&apos;t be put down, the films gripped me and wouldn&apos;t let go even for a minute."

It&apos;s hard to really understand how much the Palio influence people lives in Siena. I think this documentary at least gives you a feel and a little bit of glint of the passion in it and how strong the Contrade Civetta bounds together young and old people. I&apos;m impressed how the film makers could get access to this really unique footage and interview&apos;s. This is a must see if you like modern documentaries!

      "reviewBody": "After the super duper success of Sholay the Sippy&apos;s came up with this lavish James Bond type action flick. I really can&apos;t give the Sippy&apos;s enough credit for making Shaan so different to Sholay. Whilst Sholay was a mesh of different genres Shaan is more or less a straight forward action epic. You can see it&apos;s inspiration from the title sequence, which is reminiscent of the Bond movies. Even the villain Shakaal&apos;s lair is modelled on that of a Bond villain&apos;s. Amitabh Bachan,Shashi Kapoor and Shatrughan Sinha perform well whilst Sunil Dutt and Rakhee Gulzar provide fantastic support. Even Kulbushan Karbanda was extraordinary as the evil Shakaal. Shaan also benefits from having a good number of villain character actors, from what I remember there was Dilip Tahil, Sharat Saxena,Goga Kapoor,Sudhir,Mac Mohan and quite a few more. Kulbushan Karbanda had a tough job on his hands trying to match upto the tyrant Gabbar Singh but he delivers. Although half of that credit goes to writers Salim Javed for creating such a fantastic villain in the form of Shakaal Let me take this opportunity to mention an interesting fact, I had seen Kulbushan Karbanda in many movies as a child and had seen Shaan over 30 times yet failed to recognise him as Shakaal because I had never seen him bald. The songs by R.D. Burman were great, especially Pyar Karnewale and Yamma Yamma. Salim Javed had a tough job on their jobs trying to write a script to rival their previous movie Sholay but they delivered. The script was good but the action scenes were fabulous. Shaan is further proof that with Amitabh on board the Sippy&apos;s can create classics, even further proof was their next venture Satte Pe Satta.",

There&apos;s somewhat of a story and it eventually gets there, but really - watching tits and ass in fine form will detract and distract you from the plot.\n\nGuns, strippers, creative camera work, split screens make this seem like a comic book and it probably actually is based on a comic book story - who knows.\n\nPerfect movie for those who aren&apos;t politically correct in terms of how women should behave. This is what the &quot;Spice Girls&quot; movie would be like if it was really a movie -not just a bunch of giggling girls.\n\nWith totally ridiculous humor, over the top drama / action and women that truly bring the &quot;Girl Power&quot; on, this is a movie that is fun to watch - even with your girlfriend.\n\nEasy potential to be a series or a music video.\n\nI loved it."

      "name": "One of the better sports-related movies",
      "reviewBody": "This was a much more difficult Joe Jackson story to tell than `Field of Dreams.&apos;\n\nSports movies are never easy to do and making one that reaches beyond the bounds of sports fans is especially challenging. While `Eight Men Out&apos; may not quite grab the non-sports enthusiast as well as `Field of Dreams,&apos; `Hoosiers&apos; or `A League of Their Own,&apos; (my own nominations for the three best sports-related movies of all-time), it DOES more than hold its own among the top third of the ever-growing list of baseball movies.\n\nThis is largely because it is not really a  BASEBALL movie. Like the aforementioned films, it is a movie about people who happen to PLAY baseball. Based on the Eliot Asinof novel, the movie is, by and large, historically accurate. It also seems to be fairly even-handed in dishing out guilt. Yes, the players played for skinflint Charles `Old Roman&apos; Comiskey, yes they were easy prey for the gambling element, yes they were lacking in education and common sense  yet they are not portrayed as innocent victims, either.\n\nI have been a huge David Strathairn fan ever since `Eight Men Out.&apos; His sensitive portrayal of star pitcher Eddie Cicotte was pivotal to the movie&apos;s success. Asinof correctly focused on Cicotte as the pivotal figure in the World Series fix. `Eddie&apos;s the key!&apos; more than one character exclaimed. Other players, approached with the idea of throwing the series, reacted with shock when finding out the highly-respected Cicotte was involved. This was certainly no easy choice for Cicotte, a man of some integrity and conscience, but a pitcher nearing the end of his salad days and a man bitter at his mistreatment by Comiskey. Strathairn plays the intelligent, stressed character under the gun as well as any actor of his generation.\n\nThe rest of the cast is fine, too, with despicable Chick Gandil (Michael Rooker) and Swede Risberg (Don Harvey) playing the odds and pressuring teammates to go along. James Read is excellent as henpecked southern pitcher Claude `Lefty&apos; Williams, probably the second most respected player on the team.  Of course Buck Weaver (John Cusack) is a huge figure, considering the gamblers&apos; pitch, then opting to pass when the money isn&apos;t immediately forthcoming. \n\nThe movie isn&apos;t shy about its version of good guys &amp; bad guys. Gandil, Risberg &amp; Swede&apos;s buddy Fred McMullin (Perry Lang) are the villains, while Williams, Weaver, Joe Jackson (D.B. Sweeney) and Manager Kid Gleason (John Mahoney) are victims. Hall of Famer Eddie Collins (Bill Irwin) and no-nonsense catcher (and controversial Hall of Famer) Ray Schalk (Gordon Clapp) are frustrated on-lookers, while Dickie Kerr (Jace Alexander) is the wide-eyed &amp; naïve rookie. All turn in fine work and I find myself loving the taciturn Schalk, the kind of catcher every manager wants. Most interesting is the movie&apos;s portrayal of Shoeless Joe, who is interpreted as being mildly retarded, rather than just illiterate.\n\nThe baseball scenes are quite realistic, as are the ballpark backdrops. I first saw it the year after visiting Old Comiskey Park (the year before it was torn down) and felt right at home on the movie set  even the turnstiles looked authentic.\n\nIn closing, I can&apos;t honestly say that someone with NO knowledge or interest in baseball would flip over this film. Yet, one doesn&apos;t have to be a bleacher bum to enjoy it  and not knowing the outcome may actually make it MORE fun for the neophyte! Overall, a fine movie."

      "reviewBody": "I sat down to watch the 1987 &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; after having just revisited the 1979 &quot;Salem&apos;s Lot&quot;. And with the movie sporting a cover similar to the original 1979 movie, I assumed that there was a chance that this sequel might actually be an okay movie.\n\nTruth be told, 2021 was actually the first time for me to sit down and watch &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot;. And it will also be my last time. Wow. Just wow. &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; was bad, really, really bad. I mean it wasn&apos;t even on the same page as the 1979 predecessor. Nay, &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; was just something that felt like a spoof.\n\nIt was painful and gut wrenching to sit through &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; and watch the ridiculous storyline unfold on the screen. God only knows what went through the minds of Larry Cohen and James Dixon when they were writing the script for this atrocity of a movie.\n\nThe special effects in the movie were poor, and actually even worse off than the special effects in the predecessor that was made 8 years before. So that is a bad testiment to how bad &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; really is.\n\nThen there was the acting, or what was supposed to resemble acting. There was a shared concensus of putting on poor acting performances among the actors and actresses, or so one would think by looking at the performances put on throughout the course of the movie.\n\nI found &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; to so bad that it felt like a slap to the face with a cold, dead fish. Don&apos;t waste your time on this 1987 sequel, because it is horrible.\n\nMy rating of director Larry Cohen&apos;s &quot;A Return to Salem&apos;s Lot&quot; lands on a mere three out of ten stars.",

I was pretty sure I would be re-watching &quot;Shotgun Stories&quot; in the morning as I planned to fall asleep. I was amazed that a very slow moving, no real action to speak of movie did such a great job of keeping my interest up. Kicked it out of the DVD at 1:00am, reminded myself to find out who the star was and see what else he had been in since I do not remember him from anything. Michael Shannon is a great friggin actor. I had no interest at all in &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; but will see it now just to watch his Oscar nominated work.\n\n&quot;Shotgun Stories&quot; is well worth the hour and a half. You may find yourselves waiting for something big to happen and then realize it did without the gun play or explosions.",

Not that I had much anticipation of this movie being any good in the first place, but the possibility of some steamy T&amp;A lured me in. How stupid was I. This has to be one of the lowest budget movies I&apos;ve ever seen and will probably ever see. Low-budget doesn&apos;t necessarily dictate a bad movie, but Dead Weekend is one of the countless bombs people wonder how they got made in the first place. \n\nAlthough this movie is being sold as a sci-fi adventure all it really amounts to is a low-budget T&amp;A romp through wasteland. The story and cast are horrible with Stephen Baldwin obviously taking this on as a quick paycheck. Believe me when I say everything about this movie is bad beyond belief. Perhaps the ugliest part is even the T&amp;A can&apos;t save this mess of a film.",

A request for an autograph leads to the first showdown between the actor and the gangster. Western films have led us to believe Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro (and now Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson) are the stereotypical gangsters that whack and or whip out a garrote at the smallest slight. Not the stoic Gang-pae, played so well by Ji-Seob So, who barely needs any dialog to convey his thoughts or reactions. From the moment he agrees to be on screen, and to fight for real, I began to get a feeling of dread. His line to the action star about finally becoming a real actor was as heartbreaking in its own way as the events that followed. Like I said, action yes, but the characters made made it a solid film.",

Only the Korean (looks awful) and Indian movies are shown, the Hollywood product apparently being too pricey.\n\nAttempts at making the comparison meaningful, like having the two audiences comment TITANIC, don&apos;t yield anything useful. There are glimpses of the life styles of the different communities which occasionally get attention. The makers resist the chance to ridicule the Koreans, which is at least winning, but at this length the film drags.\n\nCutting and pointing the work with a sharp commentary could validate the possibilities the shape of the project provides."

The actors preform their characters excellent, and the smart story evolves beautifully. It&apos;s shot in beautiful Norwegian scenery and includes a lot within its duration. I really love all the different elements that makes this movie unique, a nice mix of comedy, car-chases and cigars are always fun! This is a movie that should be appealing to everyone, any age.\n\nI&apos;ve not seen the original danish version, but no-matter how it is, this Norwegian version is well worth a look.

The story takes place in the 1930s, when there were strict foreign exchange regulations between Nazi Germany and Austria. A writer commutes to Salzburg every day to attend the festival there. And of course this leads to an enchanting dalliance with all sorts of potential for confusion...\n\nMarianne KOCH and Paul HUBSCHMID play bravely against the harmless narrative.

There are also interesting impressions from the festival.\n\nAs a feature film, the SALZBURG STORIES only have a museum character.",

      "reviewBody": "The Locket (1946)\n\nWell, when you have a post-war movie with Robert Mitchum at his young prime, you can&apos;t go wrong.\n\nThe star (or starlet, as they used to say) is actress Laraine Day playing Nancy, and she pulls off a charming, attentive, smartperfect woman. A bride to be, in fact. The movie starts with people arrive to a high class wedding. Mitchum shows up via flashback (classic film noir stuff). In fact, there is a flashback within a flashback within a flashback (4 levels) and it&apos;s sort of fun.\n\nThere are some great lines like, &quot;If you&apos;e lucky you can afford to be nice.&quot; But some of the dialog, and maybe the plot overall, is a hair stiff at times.\n\nDirector John Brahm is not well known, but his &quot;Hangover Square&quot; the year before is really great. And this one shows a consistent sense of storytelling and drama with highs and lows if not always fully developed characters. The key character is Nancy, who uses her charm to win over the audience as well as the men around her in the plot. Day plays her role perfectly—swiveling sweetness against a just perceptible insincerity. She&apos;s a terrific liar.\n\nWhich brings me back to Mitchum, who is good but seems to be reading rehearsed lines too often. I think there was supposed to be chemistry between Day and Mitchum, but it wasn&apos;t there, even though they both look terribly good. \n\nThough it has a noir-like flavor, this strikes me as a straight up melodrama overall, and with soaring music and lots of dramatic lighting there is no way to not get absorbed in it. There are some short but well done scenes of London during the war (bombs and blackouts). \n\nA well done and lesser known good one. And a fun curiosity—the crazed music box music that denotes an uneven state of mind is the same as that used in the &quot;Bad Seed.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "THE RIVER KING is a high profile film that went directly to DVD without the benefit of a theater run. It is anyone&apos;s guess why a film of this quality should not make it commercially while there are so many less well-made movies that linger on the screens for weeks or months. The film is well acted, well directed, beautifully photographed and well scored.\n\nThe possible reason for its lack of attention may have been due to some test screenings where the audience was asked to evaluate. Despite all of the fine points of the film the problem lies in the screen adaptation by David Kane of the haunting novel by Alice Hoffman. Too many loose ends do not a story make and in the final analysis it is difficult to converse with someone who has not seen the film just what it is about.\n\nOstensibly, THE RIVER KING is about a private prep school out in the snowy fields of somewhere, a place where secret societies still haze, faculty are still under the control of the school&apos;s funders, and appearances are far more important than truths. Abel (Edward Burns) is called in to investigate the found drowned body of a student, and with his partner (John Kapelos) the two detectives suspect foul play - suicide, murder, hazing. Their investigation includes questioning the victim&apos;s only friend Carlin (Rachelle Lefevre) and one photography and English Lit teacher Betsy (Jennifer Ehle). But as the investigation proceeds, Abel has flashbacks to his childhood memories of his own older brother&apos;s suicide, dark secrets that have haunted him, and it is this psychic matrix which serves as the canvas for him to resolve the case as well as to relate to the various characters within the confines of the prep school.\n\nMany of the questions raised by the narrative remain unanswered by this frustrating script, but the actors bring as much involvement and credibility as they are able to create a film of mystery and self-realization in the snow and ice of the fields around the school. For those who wish more, reading Hoffman&apos;s novel will be more satisfying. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Annie Hall&quot; is a brilliant romantic comedy that could have only been made by Woody Allen (Oscar-winning in directing and writing, nominated in acting). Allen stars as a Jewish stand-up comic who falls in love with aspiring actress Diane Keaton (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn as the titled character). Their relationship is explored throughout the course of the film in a gentle and warm-hearted way. Allen&apos;s unique views and brand of humor are prevalent from start to finish and the film is clearly made in the 1970s as many issues from that time period are explored as the film progresses. &quot;Annie Hall&quot; is simple in many ways, but deals with romantic issues in complex ways and the film is just so intelligent that it is near impossible to dislike. Woody Allen is brilliant as he usually is. Diane Keaton hit super-stardom as well with her role. The supporting cast includes the likes of Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Tony Roberts, Christopher Walken and Colleen Dewhurst. Look for an unknown Jeff Goldblum as an extra during the Los Angeles sequence. 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad &apos;mutiny&apos;, and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America&apos;s darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.\n\nAmistad ranks as one of McConaughey&apos;s finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. \n\nDespite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Bruce Willis with his shrivelled nuts grew old. This movie was a really awful attempt at a Quentin Tarantino that lacked in every aspect, from its poor dialogue, the realism, gangsters just don&apos;t act that way and its scenes. By the end of this movie, left feeling what a waste of time! Why do they honestly bother making this trash, as this movie certainly will not give them credibility or help them with their careers.\n\nDon&apos;t fake it, was the only message in this film as it certainly was a compromise on any genuine attempt at making a movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;From Hell&quot; is an interesting spin on the familiar Jack the Ripper tale, using the iconic cultural image of the cloaked man with the top hat as the source for a spin-off not of history, but of a graphic novel.\n\nThe lead performance by Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline (who really existed in 1888 at the time of the murders and really was an authority on the case) is wonderful. Depp nails the cockney accent perfectly. Unfortunately, Heather Graham -- as the prostitute Mary Kelley -- is not as fortunate. Although her accent seems to improve throughout the film at various intervals, for most of &quot;From Hell&apos;s&quot; duration her British voice is quite stiff and the American twang is audible. The Hughes Brothers did not choose Graham for her acting abilities.\n\nThat said, the set design on this production is magnificent. 1880s London is brought to life and Whitechapel has never looked more realistic. The film is an odd hybrid of genres because it maintains the look and feel of a slasher film whilst presenting historical elements and painstaking recreations of actual murders. Robbie Coltrane, as one of the police officers involved in the case, has a lot of fun with his character and is fun to watch, and similarly as convincing as the scenery.\n\nThis is a very gritty and gory film -- more so than I ever expected. It&apos;s quite a strange beast with hallucinogenic visuals, horror elements and history thrown in for good measure, on top of some slightly modernized techniques. All in all this film kept me entertained because it was unique, and very different, and not particularly because it was &quot;great.&quot; I didn&apos;t expect a whole lot, but I felt that the movie was directed as ably as it could (or should) have been and the performance by Johnny Depp was deserving of a better film. The ending got a bit carried away, but it still presents a pretty cool twist on the whole Jack the Ripper scenario without totally insulting the intelligence or even upsetting one&apos;s sense of history. (Like Disney&apos;s &quot;Pocahontas.&quot;) The respect the filmmakers have for their material shines through and elevates this above what it could have been. Definitely worth seeing, if only for its originality.",

      "reviewBody": "Just TWO (2) stars as an average rating?? OK, I think I know what&apos;s going on here. The people who have actually seen this incredibly obscure movie &amp; registered a ratings vote are most likely devotees of the source material and were understandably disappointed. I think I read James Fenimore Cooper&apos;s LAST OF THE MOHICANS when I was about 11 and skipped to the action scenes. Which once you get down to it is what the Italians have done here. Gone are any sense of character development, exposition, plot nuances, etc. Of the film&apos;s 400 or so lines of dialog maybe 100 of them are directly from Cooper&apos;s novel, and most of those delivered by Paul Muller as an implacable British commander of a frontier outpost during the French and Indian War. He always gets the good lines because he was an actual actor.\n\nBut you see, an even vaguely faithful adaptation of the book was not the point of this production, which is actually an early era Spaghetti Western with guys dressed up as Mohicans or 18th century soldiers instead of cowboys &amp; Pistoleros. It&apos;s a potboiler entertainment intended to wile away rainy Saturday afternoons for 10 - 14 year old boys and their fathers rather than a stirring rendition of classic literature. The costumes and weaponry are likely inaccurate, the military traditions on display far from historically adept, and yes the Italian and Spanish supporting actors made up with boot polish to portray a Native American fighting force look ridiculous. Bugs Bunny had more credibility when he tunneled into Napoleon&apos;s castle and started playing boogie-woogie on the harpsichord while wearing a hoop dress, though the French are correctly portrayed as foppishly effete even when firing cannons at people.\n\nSo fans and history buffs looking for a detailed visage of LAST OF THE MOHICANS and its fascinating events would be well served to look elsewhere, which is why Michael Mann made his version in 1992. There you go, see ya later. But for students of B grade European genre cinema this will prove a indispensable study in the kitsch entertainment the Italians always seemed to do best. Euro Horror gods Jack Taylor &amp; Paul Muller headline the cast of Redcoats, with Barbara Loy and Sara Lezana providing the eye candy women who become the focus of the plot since Italian genre cinema always ends up being about sex. Daniel Martín and José Marco ham it up as the local friendly Injun guides who help to escort them through the hostile Spanish wilderness substituting for 18th century New England (at least I am assuming the film was made in Spain: It looks like Andalucía at any rate) under the expert guide of Hawkeye, played by familiar genre actor Luis Induni who looks like he wandered onto the set from a cocktail party. And José Manuel Martín gets to act appropriately noble + savage as the great Huron Chief Cunning Fox, who wears a wristwatch in one scene unless my eyes deceived me.\n\nI know that Cunning Fox is a great Huron Chief because the script made a point to mention that a few times to dutifully remind viewers like myself that could care less just who the different players are &amp; what is motivating their actions. To tell the truth the whole LAST OF THE MOHICANS thing is just a series of reference points by which audience members can navigate the film&apos;s action, which is impressive at times. There are pitched battles galore, various people get tied up to trees and threatened while awaiting last minute salvation, and of course Jack Taylor is a much better Indian fighter than the Indians themselves. Which makes sense once you think about it, because if his character was not a better Indian fighter than the Indians they would have killed him early on and the movie would be over.\n\nA special note must be made of the direction by Mateo Cano, who&apos;s stylistic approach has as much in common with Sergio Leone as an episode of MORK &amp; MINDY does. It&apos;s interesting to see an Italian genre film made before the style factor which made Spaghetti Westerns so distinctive. The direction and camera work are artlessly straight-forward, and the musical score by Bruno Canfora and the usually brilliant Angelo Francesco Lavagnino is more evocative of a 1960s Italian horror film -- which is indeed the case, as some of Lavagnino&apos;s themes from CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD are replayed, albeit at a different tempo. They even reused the fort set from Amando de Ossorio&apos;s &quot;Three From Colorado&quot; and probably the same mishmash Injun brave costumes previously seen in Jose Elorietta&apos;s FURY OF THE APACHES; Both films made at about the same time as this one, and just as adorably square once you get down to it. I love it when they play this stuff straight, it sort of heightens the absurdity of the proceedings.\n\nAfter 1966 Italian made Westerns became self-consciously arty, filled with the glib humor, hip asides and hypnotic atmospherics that made the derivative plotting, wooden acting, familiar landscapes &amp; identical architecture less of an issue. This one earns points for being novel as far as Spaghetti Cinema though it&apos;s service to Mr. Cooper&apos;s novel is minimal. After watching it I&apos;m not really any more compelled to read the book again, though I could sure go for another Spaghetti Western.\n\n5/10, since the film is immune to conventional criticism. Look for a gloriously widescreened Greek subtitled version, the color is magnificent even if the aspect ratio isn&apos;t quite right.",

Somehow the movie remains upbeat as Matilda is able to find someone who will love her even though her parents don&apos;t appreciate her. Young Mara Wilson shines as Matilda. Each time I watch this I am amazed at her talents at such a young age. I haven&apos;t heard of her making any films lately...I hope this is by her own choice. \n\nIn addition, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Pam Ferris, and Embeth Davidtz all were wonderful in their roles as Matilda&apos;s parents, principal and teacher, respectively. I have read the book, and yes, it is different as far as the setting goes, but in my opinion, they&apos;ve kept the main ideas quite intact. Movies are almost never the same as books, because by definition they can&apos;t be. We have enjoyed watching this as a family for at least 5 years now and will continue to. I just wish they&apos;d release a special edition DVD with COMMENTARY. I&apos;d love to hear from Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman about the making of this someday classic movie. At least it is in my family. My criterion for a classic? We are constantly quoting its script to each other.\n\nUPDATE: They DID release a special edition. It does have some fine extras, but I have to wonder why in the world didn&apos;t they offer a widescreen edition? That is a big disappointment.",

      "reviewBody": "Right, well Hong Kong cinema is well known for its sappy romantic comedies, right up alongside with the hardcore action movies. And being a sucker for all things Asian and Hong Kong cinema in particular, of course I jumped at the chance when I was given it to sit down and watch &quot;Dan sun nam nui&quot; (aka &quot;Don&apos;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;).\n\nInitially I had not even heard about the movie prior to finding it by sheer, random luck. But seeing that it had both Louis Koo and Daniel Wu on the casting list, of course I was more than intrigued, because these are definitely among the more established of actors in the more recent cinema.\n\nThe storyline and plot in &quot;Don&apos;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; was fairly straight forward, even for a romantic comedy. But don&apos;t be scared off, because that doesn&apos;t mean that the movie wasn&apos;t entertaining. I happened to find the movie rather enjoyable and entertaining, to be honest.\n\nI am not overly familiar with Yuanyuan Gao, but I must admit that she really carried the movie quite well with her charming personality on the screen and her ability to bring lots of emotions and charisma to the movie.\n\nIf you enjoy Hong Kong cinema and have a taste for the romantic comedies, then you definitely should take the time to watch &quot;Don&apos;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; if you have the chance.",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone who is looking for an historically accurate depiction of the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava, and the events that preceded it, had best leave this one on the video store shelf. Visually, the movie is well done and the cavalry action scenes are nearly as good as those portrayed in Sergei Bondarchuk&apos;s &quot;Waterloo&quot; - despite the fact that Bondarchuk had most of the Russian Army as extras. Unfortunately, director Tony Richardson couldn&apos;t make up his mind whether he was making a movie or a social commentary and his indecision pervades the story line from beginning to end. I notice that some other commentators here have praised the film for its accuracy. In reality it was anything but - most of the sub-plots were fabricated and some of the actual battle scenes are either gross distortions of what actually happened or improbable speculations. Captain William Morris (17th. Lancers), for example, was not foppish dilettante soldier portrayed - rather he was a tough, seasoned professional who had attended the Royal Military College, served in three previous campaigns and had taken part in the charge against the Sikh guns at Aliwal, India. Nor did he ride back wounded to the British lines after the charge as the movie would have it - in fact he was so badly wounded that he was left on the battlefield and was rescued much later by two of his comrades, both of whom received the Victoria Cross. And Captain Louis Nolan certainly didn&apos;t have an affair with Morris&apos; wife (Vanessa Redgrave) as the plot implies - Nolan had never met Morris before they were both sent to the Crimea.\n\nIt was much in vogue to make iconoclastic war movies in the late &apos;60s - &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, was another - probably because of Vietnam. It&apos;s a great pity that Richardson choose &apos;The Charge of the Light Brigade&apos; as his protest vehicle since it leaves an enduring stain on the memory of 700 very gallant men. Yes, there were 700, not 600 - Tennyson got it wrong.",

In fact it&apos;s pretty terrible. I can&apos;t say just how terrible it is in relation to its three predecessors, because they were experienced way back in my murky, impressionable childhood and the only bits I can remember are the bits that were inexplicably recycled in this one.\n\nBut the real tragedy of Match of Titans is that while it&apos;s certainly a long way from the likes of the Conan films in terms of production values and, well... everything, really, it&apos;s also not quite inept enough to be funny. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the scale of incompetence runs pretty high considering it&apos;s the fourth instalment in a series, but when it comes to the crunch Rick Hill goes and ruins everything by turning in an inappropriately decent performance. Maria Ford&apos;s worth looking at, too. Not worth watching, mind you, but definitely worth looking at. There&apos;s a difference.\n\nStill, the &apos;special&apos; &apos;effects&apos; are well down to standard for the genre, as are the &apos;plot&apos;, &apos;dialogue&apos; and &apos;continuity&apos;. And I can only speculate that the &apos;fight scenes&apos; were choreographed by a couple of arthritic, wheelchair-bound 85-year-olds drunk on gin, which is great for a film entirely based around a hand-to-hand combat tournament. So it&apos;s not all bad, then."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never understood the critical slam this film has received. Then I saw the widescreen dvd version and understood; everyone has been watching it in pan and scan! The film is a visual poem. So much of the story telling is done through visual information. The impact of this is lost when the cinematography is altered. Remember that Nestor Almendros received an Academy Award nomination for his work on this film. The film has resonated with global audiences for so long for this very reason. I suggest people watch the dvd commentary with Randal Kleiser and Brooke Shields to get a better understanding of why this film is still such a popular one.\n\n People attack the acting, but these are children left alone with no one to guide them into adult sophistication. Their interaction and reactions to situations are very consistent with this scenario. Yes, the birth scene is a little rushed, but do we really need to see the umbilical cord? Not all films need to be about gritty reality, ala &quot;Taxi Driver.&quot; No one asks to see the bloody guts of the smashed witch in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;\n\nIt is a beautiful, romantic film that speaks to millions of people. It seems that only the most skeptical cynics cannot embrace this film.",

I can honestly say that I still really enjoy it. The film is pretty silly and has a lot of slapstick humor(think The Three Stooges if they were overweight black rappers from NYC in the 80&apos;s), but The Fat Boys are very likable, hilarious dudes. The Boys do well in carrying the picture and had real good chemistry with Ralph Bellamy. This is not the best comedy from this time period, but is definitely underrated and much funnier than a whole lot of stuff that gets more fanfare. Disorderlies is very much an 80&apos;s movie. Some people might call this film &quot;cheesy&quot;, but keep in mind that this is a comedy and this film is a lot of fun. Plus, The Fat Boys rock and they provide the soundtrack to this awesome 80&apos;s movie. Great stuff for sure and they absolutely do not make them like this anymore.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember enhoying the 1992 sci-fi action movie &quot;Nemesis&quot; quite a lot back in my teenage years. But having returned to it not too long ago, it was actually not all that great a movie. And I do also remember having seen the 1995 movie &quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot; once or twice, back in the day. However, I have entirely forgotten about it, aside from the big, muscular woman that was starring in it. And I remember always being somewhat repulsed by her physique.\n\nAnd as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch &quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot; once again here in 2024, of course I did so. However, it wasn&apos;t with a whole lot of great expectations though.\n\nThe movie is set to take place in 2077 in what is known as Cyborg America, yet they are still using weapons we have in our times today and even 30 years ago, that made very little sense. Wouldn&apos;t such weapons be considered archaic by that time? The storyline in &quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot; deviates so much from the 1992 movie &quot;Nemesis&quot; that it hardly feels like the same franchise. Just exactly what were writers Rebecca Charles and Albert Pyun thinking when they concocted the script and storyline for this movie?\n\nNeedless to say that there wasn&apos;t a single famous or familiar actor or actress on the cast list. But then again, a movie such as &quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot; would hardly draw in great talents, now would it? I have to say that I am still put off by the physique of Sue Price (playing Alex).\n\nThe character gallery in the movie is flaccid and superficial. You don&apos;t really get to know any of the characters, as they are either just extras or briefly passing by without much of any influence on the narrative (not that there was much of that either).\n\nThe special effects in the movie are exactly that; special. For a movie made in 1995, the special effects were quite dubious and laughable. A sci-fi movie such as this needs proper special effects to fully come off as being believable and creditable. And the props and wardrobe department didn&apos;t really manage to make the movie have a believable futuristic feel to it, which spoke well against the overall impression of &quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot;.\n\nThis is essentially a movie where you just disable your brain cells, lean back and enjoy the dubious sci-fi action, whilst munching on whatever snacks you have readily available. The movie requires absolutely no particular focus or concentration on the storyline.\n\n&quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot; is a futuristic sci-fi action movie without much of any actual sci-fi feel to it. It was, at best, a cheap knock off based on the &quot;Predator&quot; movie.\n\nMy rating of director Albert Pyun&apos;s 1995 &quot;Nemesis 2: Nebula&quot; lands on a very generous three out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "Currently only around in an Italian language version with Japanese subtitles, Naked England is an Italian made, Mondo movie look at British customs, sexuality and eccentricities. A subject matter that dictates Naked England has more in common with Arnold Louis Miller documentaries like Primitive London and London in the Raw than the Italian made Mondo Cane. Thus giving you the unusual spectacle of Italian filmmakers imitating British filmmakers who were in turn imitating Italian filmmakers. Naked England opens with a man on a tranquil golf field, his launching of a golf ball then quickly cuts to a ball of the wrecking variety making short work of old tenanent housing. This metaphor of the new demolishing the old is reflected in the ensuing crowd shots, Naked England was made at a time when top hats and bowlers were still a common site on the heads of Londoners, but were beginning to share pavement space with girls in short skirts... young, dandy fellas and the bald heads of Hare Krishnas. The timing of Naked England certainly can&apos;t be faulted, this was a period when the rest the world looked to London as a colourful, cultural trendsetter, and the makers of the film sure managed to grab a generous slice of the Swingin&apos; London pie. The film might have been more accurately titled &apos;Mondo Kings Road&apos;.\n\nSome of the subject matter of Naked England includes women&apos;s wrestling, trepanation, and a &apos;&apos;School for Wives&apos; where a professional stripper teaches the average housewife how to act sexy for their husbands. As is the nature of the beast, Naked England is mainly bogus, highly sensationalistic, and must have had the effect of getting red blooded Italians on the next plane to England while being treated with much amusement by a UK audience, where it&apos;s fakery would have been more apparent. Particularly questionable are scenes of Jesus freaks holding a public crucifixion and the depiction a Nazi themed restaurant, where customers pay to be brutalised by staff dressed in SS uniforms, then suffer a mock gassing...an experience akin to the &apos;be black baby&apos; sequence in Brian De Palma&apos;s Hi Mum. Saying that the film does specifically identify the restaurant in question- Alexander&apos;s club on the Kings road- which does check out as being an authentic location back then, and for libal reasons surely wouldn&apos;t have been name checked in the movie had there not been some credibility to this Nazi fetish sequence. Another authentic London restaurant, Melita, is similarly portrayed here as a sexuality transgressive hotspot...with a montage of transvestites preening and making out memorably scored to &apos;Eloise&apos; by Barry Ryan. The use of too theatrical, too red looking, stage blood rules out the crucifixion and trepanation scenes as being real, ditto a scene of the police tangling with criminals, which leaves the latter with faces full of Kensington gore and plays like a warm up for a scene of a blag going down in The Sweeney. On the other hand, scenes of junkies shooting up in the underground toilets of Piccadilly Circus are as grueling and real as anything in Tony Klinger&apos;s Extremes.\n\nDistributed by Miracle Films on the lower half of a double-bill with Pete Walker&apos;s Man of Violence, Naked England played the Leicester Square Jacey cinema in July 1969, before resurfacing at the Edinburgh Jacey cinema in January 1971, then transferring to the Liverpool Jacey cinema in March 1971. The more titillation orientated Mondo movies were all welcomed in British cinemas, with the likes of Naked England, The Queer.... The Erotic, Mondo Sex and Excuse Me, Do You Like Sex, showing up on the Fleapit circuit during the late sixties and early seventies. By the time VHS came along though, the perception seems to have been that these films were then too tame, and too dated to warrant being preserved on the new media. The copy of Naked England that is currently on the film collectors circuit looks to have been recorded off Italian television, and has managed to acquire Japanese subtitles along the way.\n\nUnlike many foreign Mondo movies which turned an eye towards Britain, but faked the location work, Naked England was predominantly shot on British soil, meaning you do get lots of late 1960s London here. From a Brit-Sleaze perspective, there&apos;s also footage of an exhibition of Harrison Marks&apos; photographic work, with Marks&apos; friend and straight man Stuart Samuels seen manning the counter and selling prints of Marks work. While a suspect look at Nude psychotherapy, which just seems to be an excuse to fill the screen with naked glamour models, offers a fleeting glimpse of Esme Johns, thus shattering the idea that Groupie Girl was her only movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Of the three John Grisham adaptations that were released in 1993 / 1994, &quot;The client&quot; is in my opinion the worst.\n\n&quot;The firm&quot; (1993, Sidney Pollack) has a credible opening followed by too much action.\n\n&quot;The Pelican brief&quot; (1993, Alan J. Pakula) has an unlikely opening but is tense once the story is &quot;on the road&quot;.\n\nIn &quot;The client&quot; (1994, Joel Schumacher) the storyline never becomes credible.\n\nCentral theme is a young boy who has seen too much and therefore becomes a target for the maffia. This theme is not unlike the theme of for example &quot;Witness&quot; (1985, Peter Weir). The problem with &quot;The client&quot; is that the storyline is a little bit overloaded.\n\nThe boy is not only a target for the maffia but also chased by the public prosecutor, for whom his political ambitions are more important than the safety of his witness.\n\nThe boy lives in a poor single parent family with a history of violence by an alcoholic father.\n\nThe boy is assisted by a female lawyer who also has a history of drinking problems.\n\nCentral to the film is the relationship between the boy (played by Brad Renfro) and his lawyer (played by Susan Sarandon). Althoug both play well, the relationship never becomes credible. The lawyer is drifting very far from her profession and the 11 years old boy acts like a little Trump firing his lawyer every time he gets irritated.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, whose title means &quot;The Angels of the Neighborhood,&quot; is an obscure but appealing little piece that was imported by I.F.E. only to be shown, badly dubbed in English, on U.S. television under the title &quot;The Five Angels&quot;. It is about five little boys, war orphans living in a cellar, who survive by their wits in postwar Italy and find one day a German cache of money. They make the mistake of entrusting it to an adult, whom they presume is a friend but is really a thief, spends much of it and wants to take the whole amount. This is in spite some genuine fondness for the boys. Later the kids tire of living the &quot;dolce vita&quot; and start giving the money away to other needy children and buying them gifts. Jacques Sernas plays the greedy adult friend and Rossana Podesta&apos; is a sympathetic lady of the neighborhood whom the thief falls for. When Sernas is sent to jail for a short time for previous thefts, the boys decide to give away their money to the church. The kids and their naive and sometimes goofy antics are a delight to watch and they were well selected by director Carlo Borghesio, who made the equally amusing &quot;Il monello della strada&quot; with comic actor Macario. Marisa Merlini plays Sernas&apos; former flame, and Virgilio Riento is a simpatico doorman. In short, we have here a pleasant trifle aimed at the juvenile audience, with the intention of teaching them Christian generosity, but which is otherwise totally without pretension. Nino Rota, who scored most of Fellini&apos;s great films, wrote the music for this one."

      "reviewBody": "This Republic western is an interesting work, well-directed by Sam Newfield, starring glacial-eyed Bob Steele with a solid supporting cast, a well-constructed scenario featuring a goodly amount of fresh dialogue and situations, and an obviously more than competent crew which covers its assignments well as apparent from the excellent sound, cinematography and editing, not a presumption within this normally low-budget genre. Steele portrays Colt Ferron, a cowboy who avenges his father&apos;s murder by slaying, albeit in self-defense, the two responsible and, as an outlaw, rides with a gang headed by Wolf Whitson (Ted Adams), a type of western Robin Hood who steals back rustled cattle in order to return them to their proper owners, remaining with the riders until Whitson dissolves his group because dissidents, impatient of their less than lucrative criminal activity, have begun to branch out into bank robbery and murder. The relationship between Colt and his mentor Wolf becomes absorbing, especially as both men eventually face juridical punishment for their crimes; the acting throughout is quite good as is fitting from such an assemblage of old hands, particularly from Ernie Adams as a sidekick of Colt and Wolf, and the horsemanship is superb, indeed silk-like from the centaurish Steele aboard Flambow, one of his favourite, and most intelligent, mounts.",

      "name": "Mediocre Paella/Schnitzel adventure co-produced by Spain and Germany , being utterly shot in Madrid and surroundings",
      "reviewBody": "Spanish/German co-production shot in Spain , including dangerous adventures and sympathetic roles , being shot in Madrid studios and surroundings as Seseña , La Pedriza and Aranjuez , Toledo . A pleasant adventure set in 19th century Iraq , there Kara Ben Nemsi (Helmuth Schneider replacing Viktor Staal) a writer , adventurer and doctor crosses the sunny desert when he meets his old friend Hadschi Halef Omar (Georg Thomalla) who is now married and has a baby , but he early abandons his family and accompanies him to enjoy other adventures . The adventurer doctor is asked for help from Dosorza (Antonio Casas) whose wife was killed and his children kidnapped by the nasty smuggler Säfir (Rafael Luis Calvo) . Meanwhile , Kara Ben Nemsi and Hadschi Halef Omar are pursued by Safir&apos;s hoodlums : the extreme villains Pädar (Barta Barri) and Aftab (José Manuel Martín) . As they are fighting an unseen Arab enemy who always struck in the dark . There also appears two lost men , a British , archaeologist Sir David Lindsay (Theo Lingen) and the German Professor Ignaz Pfotenhauer (Fernando Sancho who bears the comic relief) , a real expert on ornithology , who are taken imprisoned . But Kar Ben Memsi discovers the smuggling shelter : the Babylon ruins , he then frees two beautiful damsels in distress , Säfa (Mara Cruz) , Safir&apos;s daughter , and Irida (Pilar Cansino) and meets his abducted friends . \n\nThis is a sequel to ¨Die Sklavenkarawane¨ or ¨Caravana De Esclavas¨ (1958) by Ramon Torrado with Viktor Staal , Georg Thomalla , Mara Cruz , Theo Lingen ,José Guardiola , made with similar artistic and technician team . It is an exciting adventure movie including thrills , shots , fights , duels and marvelous oriental outdoors , though filmed in Spain . Risked adventures and interesting roles along with solid action and a good sense of humor pulled off by an attractive couple : Fernando Sancho and Theo Lingen . The most spectacular scenes are the fights on the desert and the Babylon ruins . Although some fights are not convincing and the short budget is occasionally revealed , as it is filled with stock-shots and matte-painting . Support cast is plenty of familiar Spanish faces , usual in co-productions of the 60s and 70s , such as : Fernando Sancho, Antonio Casas , Angel Alvarez , Barta Barri , Francisco Bernal , José Riesgo , Xan Das Bolas , José Luis Martin and an ominous leader of the bandits , Rafael Luis Calvo , who played with vicious intensity . Originally it was planned to shoot this picture at its historical location in Turkey , but for organizational reasons it was decided to make it in Spain instead . The film is set in Bagdad , Basora , Iraq , though is was actually shot in Aranjuez, and Madrid , Spain ; being well photographed by the prestigious cameraman Ricardo Torres who photographed notorious titles as ¨La Mies Es Mucha¨,¨Fray Escoba¨, ¨La Vida Por Delante¨, and ¨Comicos¨ .\n\nIt is based on Karl May novel , about a known personage , ¨Kara Ben Memsi¨ , this role starred several films , most of them performed by Lex Barker , such as : &quot;Kingdom of the Silver Lion&quot; (1965) by F.J Gottlieb , &quot;Wild Kurdistan&quot; (1965) by F. J Gottlieb , &quot;The Yellow One&quot; (1964) by Robert Siodmak and ¨Die Sklavenkarawane&quot; or &quot;Caravana de esclavas&quot; (1958) by Ramón Torrado/Georg Marischka and its follow-up : ¨Der Löwe Von Babylon¨ (1959) titled Spain ¨En Las Ruinas de Babilonia¨ or ¨Lion of Babylone¨ also directed by Ramón Torrado . And other silent versions starred by Carl De Vogt as &quot;Caravan of Death&quot; (1920) , ¨Auf den Trümmern Des Paradieses¨ (1920) and ¨Die Teufelsanbeter¨ (1920) . In addition , a series television titled &quot;Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi&quot; (1973), 26 episodes starred by Michael Vogler as Kara Ben Nemsi .\n\nThe motion picture was middlingly directed by Ramon Torrado , he made a mostly decent , colorful fun , but not without gaps , failures and flaws . Similary to previous film ¨Caravana De Esclavas¨ (1958) , it was not huge hit , but successful enough to have this sequel : &quot;Der Löwe von Babylon&quot; following in the same year 1959 . Ramon was born in 1905 , Galicia, Spain. He was a director and writer, known for directing some vehicles of known Folklorics stars such as Peret in ¨Amor a Todo gas¨ (1969) , Manolo Escobar in ¨Un Beso en Puerto¨ (1966) and Paquito Rico in ¨Malvaloca¨ (1954). Torrado directed four mediocre Chorizo Westerns such as 1965 ¨Los Cuatreros¨ , 1964 ¨La Carga de la Policía Montada¨ , 1964 ¨Relevo a Pistolero¨ and 1963 ¨Bienvenido, Padre Murray¨ . Rating . 4.5/10 . Very average adventure movie .",

      "reviewBody": "X2: X-Men United is a significant escalation from its predecessor, trading the exploratory tone of the first film for a high-octane thriller with profound thematic depth. Director Bryan Singer masterfully expands the X-Men universe while delving deeper into the characters and their complex moral dilemmas.\n\nThe film&apos;s narrative is driven by a ticking clock, as the X-Men face a formidable new threat in Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), a ruthless anti-mutant zealot. This heightened stakes approach elevates the action sequences to a new level of intensity, with the climactic showdown at the Weapon X facility being a particular highlight.\n\nHowever, X2 is more than just a blockbuster spectacle. It explores mature themes of government surveillance, human experimentation, and the blurred lines between hero and villain. The introduction of Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) adds a poignant dimension to the story, as his character grapples with questions of faith and belonging.\n\nThe ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances. Hugh Jackman&apos;s Wolverine continues to evolve, showcasing his character&apos;s vulnerability alongside his ferocious fighting style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen&apos;s dynamic as Professor X and Magneto reaches new heights of complexity. Halle Berry&apos;s Storm emerges as a powerful and independent figure, while the additions of Alan Cumming and Shawn Ashmore as Iceman bring fresh energy to the franchise.\n\nOne of the film&apos;s strengths lies in its character development. Wolverine&apos;s backstory is partially unveiled, offering glimpses into his tormented past. This adds layers to his complex character, making him even more compelling. Nightcrawler&apos;s introduction brings a refreshing dynamic, his faith-based struggles providing a unique perspective on the mutant experience.\n\nWhile the film&apos;s pacing is occasionally uneven, and some plot points feel rushed, X2 remains a thrilling and thought-provoking entry in the superhero genre. It successfully builds upon the foundation laid by the first film, offering a richer and more complex exploration of the mutant world.\n\nThe relationship between Professor X and Magneto continues to be a core element, but their dynamic shifts as they find themselves on the same side, albeit for different reasons. This unexpected alliance adds complexity to their characters and provides opportunities for intriguing character interactions.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s time to fete our Director Na Hong-jin for making a masterpiece like this. This is about his noir thriller &quot;The Yellow Sea&quot;. His second film after a bang like The Chaser. The main success of this movie is for it&apos;s fast screenplay and some nail biting chasing scenes. Inspite of its long running time the movie tightly grips us during most of its running time.\n\nComing to story, The protagonist Goo-nam(Ha Jeong-woo) is a Joseon(Chinese of North Korean descent)is a taxi driver living in Yenji, China. Goo-nam&apos;s wife went to South Korea for work to lift their family. She promised that she would send money to him, but there has been no money sent by her, let alone any news from her. Goo-nam really loved her and meanwhile tortured by the possibility of her infidelity in his dream, but that is not his only problem. He has lot of debts including his wife&apos;s travel fare. He tries to solve his problem with gambling, but that makes his situation worse.The debt collector often visits and questions his pride.\n\nAfter his fierce attitude in the gambling bar, Goo-nam is noticed by a local Korean mob boss/dog seller Mr. Myeon(Kim Yoon-seok). Myeon has a plan to solve his problem. If he goes to Seoul and kills somebody, his debt problem will be solved. Giving his daughter in the safe hands(his mother)he agrees to work. Under the instructions from Myeon, he illegally entered South Korea with other Korean Chinese.\n\nHe arrives at some coastal area without much problem. He goes into Seoul while not being noticed by the law enforcement. He stays in a lousy motel room. He checks out the place where his target lives. He is clever enough to devise a good plan while spying on the daily pattern of the target during the night. He also goes around Seoul for getting any clues about the whereabouts of his wife. There is not much time left, but he still cannot find her. The time is short, and he must do the job as demanded. It&apos;s a now or never situation,the night at the freezing cold Goo-nam anxiously waits for his target to arrive at the building. And then, something unexpected happens in front of his eyes. With an unexpected twist ,He is now chased by both the police and the mobs for what he does not commits. The chasing starts, even we feel sorry for the unfortunate things happening to this inglorious bastard in the merciless world.\n\nThe plot shines lightly and it turns out a mob boss in Seoul, Tae- won(Cho Seong-ha), is involved with the incident. After the involvement of police and the media far more than he has ever thought, he becomes panic. He attempts to solve his problem even before knowing what&apos;s exactly going on. This is a real critical situation, especially when Myeon comes to South Korea after the problem between him and Tae-won. Now both want Goo-nam in their hand. Reminding the chaser the good guy plays a very bad guy role here. Can&apos;t see the rage of fight with the bones. That&apos;s really a new route of violence. Thanks to the director the car chasing scene is really a nail biting high tension scene, he makes very impressive actions sequences. The camera is a little too running. And the plot changes in to unexpected twists. Overall it is really a worth watching experience. Can&apos;t wait for another movie from Na Hong Jin.",

He is both The Colonel, an over-the-top dictator of a South American country and also a well-meaning revolutionary. When the dictator suddenly dies, the revolutionary has to take his place, since both the government officials and the revolutionaries find it necessary for the Colonel to live a little longer. The reason why I did not quite get. Cybulski overplays The Colonel in an annoyingly broad way, yet he underplays the revolutionary to the point that the character seems to have no personality at all.\n\nIn addition to the main plot, the film has a science fiction angle with a scientist, critical of the Colonel, developing a machine which can produce a double of anything. The scientist produces a double of a rich woman and then somehow enters the double and uses her to give voice to the revolution.\n\nNeither of these storylines are very interesting. The humor is too broad (there is a particularly annoying actor in drag serving as a chorus). Admittedly, the film features some stylish moments, but whatever statement it is trying to make gets lost.",

It is important to note that the film was never intended to have any relationship to the TV version. Richard Greene, of course, starred in both... and that&apos;s about the extent of it.\n\nThe Sapphire Films television series was a whole different kettle of fish. American writers blacklisted in the McCarthy era wrote under pseudonyms and packed the first two seasons with subtle left-wing ideology. The last two seasons fell into a more formulaic adventure groove, but still managed the occasional political overtone.\n\nThe movie was typical of the Hammer production philosophy... take what little budget there was, invest heavily in production costs (vivid colour, widescreen ratios), and hire a passable cast with what&apos;s leftover (including at least one bonza babe). I&apos;m betting Greene came pretty cheap and had the added bonus of drawing in fans of TV series.\n\nWhat you see is what you get. It still looks great, the storyline is good enough to last out the whole 77min, and there isn&apos;t a political statement in sight. For mine, 6.5 stars out of ten.",

I don&apos;t even know where to begin ... Gainax threw out everything they had, completely redrawing all the animation and backgrounds in painstakingly high detail. It is the most apparent revision to the series at first glance ... all the visuals are top-notch, even the computer-generated graphics which I would typically find unforgivable in a film - but everything is drawn and animated so smooth, and the rare use of CG is so well-integrated into the film that it feels like you haven&apos;t been taken out of the organic animation at all.\n\nThe storyline is quite similar to the original, though first on the side I want to say they&apos;ve taken much thought deciding how to develop the characters better; and the result is that the cast is much more believable and their chemistry is quite fantastic. The characters just feel deeper, their emotions are more genuine; it&apos;s hard to describe in a review but if you&apos;re a fan of the original series you&apos;ll find their personalities and interactions much more developed and satisfying.\n\nThe plot, as I&apos;ve said; has not changed too much at this point.. there are exceptions here and there, with the introductions of pivotal locations and characters earlier on; no doubt to lay down continuity for the later installments. (The original Evangelion had a slight problem with eclectic character and plot point introductions.) They have taken care to set the stage more carefully for the first scene this time around; and as shown with the early introduction of an important character Gainax intends to make full use of some fantastic characters that didn&apos;t get enough time in the spotlight to really add anything especially deep.\n\nI recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of serious animation; and I would say that it&apos;s an absolute must-see for fans of the original series.\n\nIt&apos;s comforting to know that in a world of poor remakes and extensions of popular titles, that Gainax has their wits about them and shows true dedication in their efforts to make Evangelion into everything that it could possibly be.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is truly one of my favorites of all times.  It is sweet and it is hopeful and it makes you think.  Actually, the issues addressed in it are quite timely.  Would you clone a dead loved one if you could?  These are issues that we ourselves will have to be facing and making decisions on in the not so distant future.\n\nVirginia Madsen is nice as the love interest.  Vincent Spano wonderfully plays Igor to Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s Frankenstein, while maintaining a mind of his own.  Mariel Hemingway is delightfully nutty and light as Meli, the coed nymphomaniac.  Interesting surprise from her during a touch football game too.  And those of you who are M*A*S*H fans will love David Ogden Stiers as the foil for Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s &quot;mad scientist&quot; hijinx.\n\nThis movie is refreshing and dramatic and subtle.  I love it, I will always love it!  And it still moves me after almost 2 decades!\n\nBTW-Those of you who appreciate soundtracks will love this one!  The &quot;String Trio Rock&quot; by Mark Cargill is interspersed throughout.  It will stay with you even after the movie is over!",

      "reviewBody": "The three Trilogy of Life films that Pier Paolo Pasolini directed have grown on me over the years. I do not like them all equally, but even the weakest one (The Canterbury Tales) has some merit in terms of composition and framing.\n\nBawdy Tales is the redheaded stepchild to those films. It was written in part by Pasolini and was produced by Alberto Grimaldi, who had produced the other films. In addition, Tonino Delli Colli and Dante Ferretti return as cinematographer and production designer. In addition, Pasolini regulars Franco Citti and Ninetto Davoli star in the frame story as two thieves who are supposedly telling the stories that we are seeing, although this is not always clear.\n\nUnfortunately, the stories are nothing special. The Pasolini Trilogy of Life films had The Decameron, The Canterbury Tales, and The Arabian Nights to draw upon. Bawdy Tales consists of, as far as I know, original tales in the style of the bawdy tales found in those books. Most deal with adultery and end in some sort of violence, which is not always true of the stories in the Pasolini films.\n\nHere we are treated to two castrations, three stabbings, a beheading, and two hangings. As a result, the stories became very familiar after awhile. Only the ending, which is somewhat modern, stood out. I liked the gallows humor (literally) of the end. The rest of the film, I was utterly indifferent to. I didn&apos;t mind watching it, but I would not watch it a second time. For all of the talent involved in the making of the film, it still felt like one of the ripoffs of the Trilogy of Life films.",

      "reviewBody": "I was thrilled to see a movie like &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; come out in theatres: a straightforward horror film not relying on clever twists (except one, small one) or gimmicks. It was the kind of film &quot;High Tension&quot; started off as before that last act mindf*ck. And while I ended up appreciating what that movie did, I would have loved it more without the twist.\n\n&quot;Wolf Creek&quot; picks up where films like &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; left off, without feeling the need to necessarily &quot;pay homage&quot; to them. I wonder if the fact that it&apos;s not American-made has anything to do with that. I also wonder if the non-American influence kept this from becoming predictable or familiar in any way. What you think is going to happen in this film never quite happens. One of the original &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; taglines was, &quot;Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them?&quot; I think this film asks the same question, but doesn&apos;t provide so simple an answer.\n\nI think it&apos;s best to know little about &quot;what happens&quot; here before seeing it. Most people know the basics--three backpackers on a road trip, they stop at remote Wolf Creek, entering an odd Twilight Zone of stopped time and dead car engines. A friendly bushman stops by willing to help, let the nightmare begin.\n\nI love that director/writer/producer Greg McLean never offers an explanation for the watches and the car engine. What happens in this film seems almost alien--three humans struggling to survive on what appears like a distant, barren planet, up against a hunter with no semblance of humanity in him. Yes, this movie is very similar to &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&quot; but it is in no way a rip-off. While the early-morning showdown on the barren road may look similar to the climax of TCM, it is its own nightmarish entity. In fact, some of the scene reminded me of &quot;Duel.&quot; The acting in this movie is brilliant. The three leads--Ben, Kristi, and Liz--are so wonderfully likable, and there is an odd feeling of improvisation in the acting. It&apos;s so natural, it seems impossible to script. When everything goes to hell, you want all three of them to survive, and you&apos;ll surely be devastated by the slightest injury any of them endures. Many have complained about the hour or so of build up, but I think it was brilliant on McLean&apos;s part to make sure we cared about these people, and then to put them through the wringer. It&apos;s sadistic, too, emotionally, but it&apos;s the sign of a great director.\n\nJohn Jarratt, as Mick, is unforgettably cruel. Jarratt embodies this character from head to toe, and is fearless in his performance. Mick is an ugly, cruel man, and yet when we first meet him, he seems like the nicest guy in the world. One of the scariest aspects to this film is that you can see yourself falling for all of his tricks.\n\nTo be honest, I never want to see &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; again. It&apos;s not a fun movie. I left wanting to hate it, because I hated what happened. But I admire this movie for what it managed to do. I truly had to keep repeating to myself, &quot;It&apos;s only a movie,&quot; (the infamous &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; tagline) but it&apos;s so realistic and so unflinching in portraying what happens, that you&apos;ll feel as if someone was always peeking around a corner with a camera, filming an actual event. Of course, this is based on true events, and frankly, there is some discrepancy to how &quot;true&quot; this film tries to be (obviously, much of the second act had to be dramatized, and you&apos;ll realize why once you see the movie) but it didn&apos;t need that &quot;based on true events&quot; tag. It&apos;s already very real.\n\nI hate to end on the old &quot;Jaws&quot; cliché, but as I am going to Australia soon, I can say for a fact that this does do for backpacking what &quot;Jaws&quot; did for swimming. I consider this movie a parable of sorts. Well done.",

Now it wasn&apos;t an opponent he put to sleep, but it was me. This movie had some acting without some real emotions in it, it was like Crocop turned into a Robocop...altogether with the entire cast. Although Crocop is a credible fighter,(The man would kill all those so-called action heroes in real combat!) in this movie he never convinces. The fighting-scenes were just too easy. Still I hope he will get another shot starring in an action-movie. But please let a real martial-arts movie-director do the choreography to spice it up. I rate this movie 3 out of 10, just because there is little hope of Crocop being a real action hero.",

In the year of 1848 tumults erupted all across Europe and the Grand Duchy of Florence was no exception. De Sica plays a composer and music professor who falls in with a group of political rebels in a cafe, gets into an altercation with an aristocratic lawyer, and is sentenced to exile.Later when he returns from a now successful career as an opera artist in Milan, he is reunited with the somewhat apprehensive young lady from the lawyer&apos;s family he loves.A triumphant march of the now successful, flag waving rebels occurs in the night streets. It is also interesting how the decidedly illiberal Fascist regime of the period when the film was made appealed to earlier decidedly liberal movements such as 1848 and the later Risorgimento under which the various states of Italy were finally unified, for patriotic propaganda purposes. The film is competently directed by Mario Mattoli, who would later become a specialist in comedy such as the outstanding The Poor And The Noble.",

      "reviewBody": "When Darryl F. Zanuck virtually forced exhibitors and most of his fellow studio mogul rivals to adopt CinemaScope as a panacea for TV&apos;s devastation of Hollywood&apos;s weekly box office bonanza, he dictated that virtually all of Twentieth&apos;s output was to be filmed in that eye-stretching process. &quot;There&apos;s No Business Like Show Business,&quot; directed by that old pro, Walter Lang, seems to be the prime example of Darryl&apos;s minions saying to their boss: &quot;You want wide? We&apos;ll give you W-I-D-E!!&quot;\n\nEverything about it was designed and lensed to emphasize the original ratio of the CinemaScope process and viewing it on a video that isn&apos;t letterboxed must look like what a one-eyed person must experience in everyday life. I never did see it in a theater but I have seen it on a TV broadcast which more-or-less recreated its widescreen ratio. It&apos;s a glorious mish-mash. Every Berlin tune that could be stuffed into it is given at least one run-through; John de Cuir&apos;s production design must have occupied every inch of several of Twentieth&apos;s West Los Angeles soundstages; Ethel Merman, after her terrific movie repeat of her Broadway success in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; for Fox (and now, as of 2005, available on video), trumpets away in number after number (Must have been an ear-rending experience over those original four-track stereophonic sound systems.); Dan Dailey, Donald O&apos;Connor and Mitzi Gaynor give it their energetic best; and then there&apos;s Marilyn. What can we say, with all that so sadly, in her personal life, came after she reluctantly fulfilled her contractual obligation in this one? She dazzles in, let&apos;s face it, a rather vulgar way, and seems shoehorned in to boost the potential box office. And they even added Johnnie Ray, a huge jukebox success at the time (and, due to his hearing deficiency, performing his songs at an even greater volume than La Merman.)\n\nAll in all this one shouldn&apos;t be missed if you want to view an example of Hollywood at its brassiest, in a production fairly bulging with elements that may not coalesce very harmoniously but which was, no doubt, worth the price of admission to those movie palaces before they were carved up to become the precursors of today&apos;s sterile multiplexes."

      "reviewBody": "Veronica (Gorgeous Italian actress and former Bond-girl Caterina Murino) is a young and exuberant woman dealing in the everyday with issues in her job, she also has to handle her meddlesome mother begging for a grandson and (what makes this petition a difficult goal to achieve) she is routinely married to an itinerant seller more concerned in his work (and the adulterous flirting with some of his loyal customers) than his beautiful wife. One night, Veronica&apos;s monotone life turns into a bizarre twist after being assaulted in an alley on her way home and left unconscious, being aided only by a security guard (Michele Venitucci) who beyond his good Samaritan speech, is secretly in love of her, but the weirdest consequence will surface weeks after the incident as she realizes she&apos;s pregnant... despite her husband&apos;s infertility, driving her to follow any evidence able to lead her to identify the unknown perpetrator who raped, and impregnated her.\n\nThis movie is, in fact, a &quot;dramedy&quot; that relies on a tradition of spicy Italian comedies but without their festive eroticism. Quite the opposite, there is something profoundly degrading in the story which also is the most interesting part, however -and paradoxically- it never takes off because of the poorly acted one-dimensional characters. Caterina Murino shines like a top model going through the catwalk, but her acting is as abysmal as the way her character behaves. She does not have what it takes to portray such a complex role, and that&apos;s precisely the reason why the whole scheme fails: It never decides whether being a light moral tale or a sordid take on a bourgeoisie nightmare. The humor is not as dark and corrosive as its needed, nor the dramatic elements are strong enough to feel involved with. The movie even deals with controversial themes like abortion and features some of the most shallow commentaries about real rape victims ever heard on film, something as outrageous as the story itself.\n\nScreened at Venice Film Festival in 2008, this interesting story not-so-interestingly crafted and developed into a disappointing movie has not better quality than any mediocre made-for-TV prime time drama, although it still remains as a film to be seen with ingredients worth to watch.",

      "name": "Acts of a Peaceful Indian or Magnificent Goyko Mitic: Part Eleven",
      "reviewBody": "Western. A screen adaptation of the novel &quot;Severino from the Islands&quot; by Edward Klein, which I have not read and am not going to do. Production of the East German film studio DEFA, created with the participation of socialist Romania, where the main role was played by the famous Yugoslav actor, &quot;Honored Indian of the Soviet Union&quot;, Goiko Mitic. The eleventh painting out of twelve that I intend to see and revise. And I can say for sure that I definitely did not see this particular picture. And here is my brief opinion - the deeds of a peace-loving Indian. I will say right away that there are no flaws in the picture, but there are several comments that I will highlight in a separate paragraph, but for now, let me focus your attention on the unambiguous advantages of this western. So, here they are: 1. Scenario - the picture tells about the adventures of the Indian Severino, played by Goiko Mitic. He is from a tribe of South American Indians, but he lived for many years among white people, worked long and hard, and as a result saved up a decent amount, and now he returns home in order to take his brother with him to the north, but when he arrives, he realizes that everything will be very bad just. A long absence, the relationship between white settlers and Indians, insidious bandits who skillfully hide behind the laws, personal relationships with his brother - all this will require a solution from Severino. And even the leader of his tribe is not at all peaceful in relation to the whites. The script turned out with twists, and in tone it differs from all Westerns of the film studio. There is nothing superfluous in it. The hero clings almost from the very beginning. And the finale pleased me too. 2. Nature - the picture was again filmed in Yugoslavia, where the nature is similar to the South American one. The majestic Andes are famous mountains that absolutely everyone knows. It is these shots that are the most exciting and memorable in the whole picture. And although in reality we were far from admiring the Andes, I will strongly pretend that it is they. The rest of nature is not inferior, rivers, passes, massifs, living creatures - everything reminds a person of the majestic beauty of Mother Nature, which we have ceased to notice, in pursuit of the &quot;blessings of civilization&quot; and the idiotic habit of making marasmic &quot;selfies&quot;, wow, something carried me ... In general, the picture and camera work are at the highest level. 3. Chases, shootouts - there are very few of them here, especially for this genre, but those that exist look good. The chase was especially successful. Dynamic. Staging at a high level. 4. Music - here I must inform you that the local music won me over much more than in the Western &quot;Trail of the Falcon&quot;. She is very different in tone here, winds up a certain melancholy, a desire for peace, resists war, which can be traced in the script. And although there are not so many musical compositions here (the title theme is repeated quite often), it is very memorable. The composer Gunther Fischer did a good job. 5. Entourage - atmosphere, costumes and decorations - everything is at a high level, even despite the change of the mainland, where there are unique features. Manzanero Indians, white settlers, official authorities - everything corresponds to this historical era. A little about the main characters: 1. Severino performed by Goiko Mitic - an Indian of the Manzanero tribe, who returned home after a long absence, and now he has to deal with personal affairs, and reconcile whites and Indians, whose relations are tense to the limit. He behaves reasonably, opposes the war, because he understands that his fellow tribesmen will definitely lose. His experience of living with white people actively helps in this. Goiko again played the main role perfectly, this time acting not as a mighty avenger, but as a peace-loving Indian who wants to fulfill his dream. Bravo Goiko! 2. The leader performed by Leon Nemchik is the leader of the Manzanero tribe, who hates white people and dreams of returning the tribe to its former glory, regardless of reality. Opposes Severino&apos;s attempts to resolve disputes peacefully. The ending of his life is quite predictable. Leon did an excellent job of this role. I cannot fail to mention the police sergeant, who confronts the bandits and helps Severino in everything, so that everything is quiet and peaceful in his area of responsibility. Well, of course, chases and skirmishes today are not able to amaze the viewer, as in the year the picture was released, but we will make a discount on the release time. Well, the tone of this western is strikingly different from the rest, which I could not help but notice. An unusual move. Well, next time Goiko Mitic will try to return the horses stolen by the US army. This will be the painting &quot;Leader White Feather&quot;, and in it I will draw conclusions about these Westerns by DEFA. As a result, we have a good western with the inimitable Goiko Mitic, an excellent script, an unusual tone, excellent and memorable music, excellent entourage and great acting.",

      "reviewBody": "Peter Shatz (Peter Alexander) seems like a Basil Fawlty who actually enjoys his work during the first act of this picture, buttering up to every eccentric that checks into the Park Hotel (which from the outside looks like a cheap miniature). Amongst them are, as usual, the rich family from Texas, the retired Colonel, two old ladies who love murder mysteries and a dog carrying Frenchman. Only Mathilda the maid figures out Peter really wants to get out of there and travel the world (like herself). Luckily comedy cliché # 1: The Inheritance is on it&apos;s way to him, proving that brown-nosing does get you somewhere.\n\nImmediately the multilingual wannabe Elvis starts neglecting his job, daydreaming and mixing everything up. So he books into the Grand Hotel, insults his boss and leaves Mathilda and all these carefully introduced supporting players behind to rot. Apparently his co-workers are quite happy to see him go, for lots of staff members whom we never saw before suddenly appear to say goodbye in an elaborate song and dance number.\n\nOn his way to the ski resort Herr Shatz naturally meets a love interest, who casually mentions she hates hotel porters. So crafty Peter introduces himself as an Argentinian cattle king, and after that has to keep on telling one lie after another. Joining a children&apos;s ski course leads to the usual hilarious results, complete with &apos;wah wah&apos; sound effects. Further more, each time he does something clumsy he bumps into an American actress called Marylin (yeah right). He even takes a nap in a bob sled, leading to some really bad blue screen work in a scene done only slightly more exciting ten years later in &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot;.\n\nIn between we get another couple of music videos featuring Peter singing in a carriage. Perfect stuff for a Christmas special, but totally unrelated to the plot. It gets really scary when the woman next to him opens her mouth only to sounds exactly like the three piece backup group from &apos;The Benny Hill Show&apos;. All of Alexander&apos;s numbers sound the same to me anyway, but at least the ones inside are staged differently, for instance later on he dresses like a Mexican bullfighter to sing &apos;Torero&apos; (don&apos;t ask why).\n\nWith all the outside nonsense out of the way, we move back onto the set, I mean hotel, for some old fashioned farcing around. Apparently everyone is after his money, which is running out fast. Our velvet voiced hero returns to the Park Hotel and gets back his job without too much trouble, and most everyone from the ski resort follows him for some reason or another. Of course Mathilda and all the regulars from the first paragraph are still there too, so Peter can hatch one final plan to sort everything out &apos;Mary Poppins&apos; style. Naturally this culminates in a musical number where not only Peter sings, but most of the other cast members as well.\n\n4 out of 10"

It&apos;s not meant to stand with Ghandi or Gone With the Wind. It&apos;s just a fun, silly movie with a thin plot and lots of laughs and sight gags. Go to see it because you just want to sit back with your popcorn and laugh. (And daydream about George Clooney.) Clooney gave us &quot;Good Night and Good Luck&quot;, so it&apos;s not like we should feel he &quot;owes&quot; us a &quot;serious&quot; movie. It&apos;s a fluffy little piece of nostalgia, a movie you won&apos;t be afraid to go see with your tween-age kids or Mom and Pop. Gramps will love it too, with all the vivid images of the &quot;good old days&quot; and a great ragtime score.\n\nClooney and Zellweger are campy in their roles (isn&apos;t that what they were shooting for?) and Stephen Root is a quiet riot as the hard drinking team owner.",

I kept putting it off because I usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules, starts the revolution, and reinvents the cinema. That&apos;s why, probably, I cannot like Citizen Kane - try to watch the arguably best film ever made - you will be under a lot of pressure. \n\nWell, À bout de souffle does not put you under the pressure, it takes you for a ride, and you follow for 90 minutes its incredibly young characters, common crook (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American free-spirited girlfriend (Jean Seberg) on their journey on the streets of 1960-th Paris along with Raoul Coutard&apos;s legendary camera. I am not going to tell here how great the camera work was, how fantastic the music score and the views of Paris were - the fans of the film know that already. They also know about the beginning of French New Wave, and how it influenced the future cinema. I just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago - the smoking was cool back then, and Belmondo made smoking look very sexy. Belmondo fascinates me in this film. I&apos;ve seen him in a lot of later movies - he&apos;s always been good (I recommend Le Magnifique, 1973 and Le Professionnel,1981 ) - but in À bout de souffle he is not just good - he is embodiment of cool, his face changes its expression every moment, you can not take your eyes off him. Is it me or he does remind the very young Mick Jagger - not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy? He and young (she was 21 at the time) Jean Seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever. My favorite scenes: \n\nMichel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film, and he starts to talk to us, the audience. The day is nice, the sun is shining, and the life is beautiful... \n\nMichel and Patricia drive in the convertible. The wind plays with her short hair. We only see the back of her head and her neck. Michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck, wrists, knees, but she is a chicken... \n\nPatricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed. They start talking about nothing and about very serious things. They smoke, she tries to find a good place for her new poster, and he wants to sleep with her. In the end of the scene, his face, he looks at her - there is love in that look...\n\n There is more - I am sure everyone who saw it has his/her favorite scenes."

Once the band began to murder civilians she decided to leave, she exiled in Mexico and after 12 years she came back to Spain to live and ordinary life. ETA shot her in the head in front of her little daughter: they considered that she was a traitor.\n\nI think that a figure such as Yoyes&apos; would have deserved to be filmed by a more expert director, because the débutant Helena Tabernas makes some narrative mistakes, the movie is certainly confusing and slow, some sequences are just pointless, and one or two of the actors weren&apos;t up to the job.\n\nThe movie went rather unnoticed at the time it was released. It wasn&apos;t a good idea to make a movie about a member of ETA when the PP (Popular Party) was governing the country (they were totally against the Basque separatism and, of course, against ETA). Anyway, I think it&apos;s a necessary movie that should be watched by anyone. Everything is not just black or white... you know what I mean.\n\n*My rate: 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "A mix of noir psychological thriller and political examination of class and privilege in Franco&apos;s Spain, this reminded me as much as anything of Antonioni&apos;s &apos;Story of a Love Affair&apos;, although I liked this even more. For me there were more thematic and emotional levels explored in more interesting ways. \n\nThe film is beautifully made with a striking use of transitions to keep us off base, and an alternating mix of neo-realist, and slick Hitchcockian camera work that evokes the separation of class in society. \n\nThe story is simple. A pair of upper-class lovers accidentally hit a cyclist on the highway, and leave him to die, for fear of being discovered as lovers and losing all they have in society and with each other. \n\nThe rest of the film is about both the moral questions of responsibility and ego versus a sense of communal responsibility, and the gut wracking tension as to whether the two will be discovered. \n\nI was occasionally bothered by the heavy handedness of some of the film. Sometimes it was just a too on-the-nose politically ironic line, but particularly an important sub-plot about a student the male half of our anti-hero couple, has treated unfairly. This sub-plot, while beautifully shot and well acted, feels like it exists only to make political and thematic points, and pulled me out of identifying with the film on a human level. Likewise, a couple of crucial character twists, while interesting, feel forced or sudden -- more there to make a point then to honestly continue the narrative. \n\nBut these are small flaws compared to the film&apos;s great strengths, and it is very much worth seeing."

It is actually dated of 1982. 21 years ago. And after all this time every single piece of humour you see or hear is stil funny.\n\n Ok, the sets are a bit old fashioned but stil represents the type of low-end apartment you could find in Paris and that would be hired by an non-profit association like SOS Detresse amitie.\n\nI don&apos;t know what makes this movie so present and why it is impossible not to find it funny after all this time. I think it is the ability to make laugh by taking the opposite of the common sense.\n\nAnother interesting point is that the Pere Noel has been adapted from a theatre play written and played by the same actors as in the film. And the movie doesn&apos;t look like a filmed play as it often is. There&apos;s been a great job in the adaptation of the text as well as the story (because there are some important differences)\n\nI am afraid I will see this movie every year and always laugh with it."

      "reviewBody": "Automata&apos; (2014) is a critically underrated and atmospheric science- fiction thriller in the same vein as &apos;I Robot&apos; and &apos;Blade Runner&apos;. It boasts excellent visual effects, as well as an engaging and intelligent story. While it borrows from other science fiction it does so successfully, especially the atmospheric and decaying world we&apos;re thrusts into from the beginning.\n\nThe story centers around Antonio Banderas&apos;s character, Jacq Vaucan - a world-weary insurance agent for a robotics corporation whose job is to investigate robots violating their protocols which are one: harming any form of life, and two: they can neither repair themselves nor alter another robot in any fashion. On the trail of a robot Vaucan discovers a robot stealing parts in an apparent attempt to alter itself. This leads him to the clock master - a fixer who may have just succeeded the second protocol.\n\nAutomata is a throwback to thoughtful science fiction. It&apos;s not for the feint of heart but if you&apos;re engaged and buy into the world and the premise then you&apos;ll be rewarded. The film surprised me in a lot of ways - especially for such a relatively small budget but imagery is fantastic and the effects are mostly practical, and built with little computer generated imagery save for some backgrounds and action scenes which make it that much more realistic.\n\nIt&apos;s slower and probably has less action but if we&apos;re comparing it to what it will inevitably be compared to, &apos;I Robot&apos;, Automata is a better movie. More thoughtful, grittier and executed a whole lot better visually. It&apos;s not a perfect flick by any means but it&apos;s worth watching and deciding for yourself.\n\n7.5/10",

I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a chick flick but definitely would be easy to see with some girlfriends but a couple would get a few chuckles out of it. Assuming you&apos;ve never swung, it is a bit clichéd but it&apos;s not supposed to be taken seriously. The actors do a great job and maybe the writing could have been better. The directing was a bit bland but the overall quality of the production was pretty good. I thought the two main character had good chemistry too. Mandy is not my actress of choice but she&apos;s pretty good at light comedy. I&apos;ve seen far worse actors trying to do comedy. I would recommend this film to friends and couples alike. If anything, once you finish the movie it will be easier to broach the subject of &apos;swinging&apos; if you get the vibe that your partner is into it!"

It was a little too violent for me back then and made me a bit uncomfortable (I was just a kid).  I just watched it again (I bought the tape through Amazon)...and I have to admit that it has stood up pretty well. It is a rather dark story but it has some rather interesting and creative kill scenes.  Also watch for the forensic detective...he has some pretty funny comments about the murders.  It is a pretty original movie...definitely B grade but worth a look.\n\n7/10",

It wasn&apos;t even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. \n\nThe plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this.\n\nejames6342",

Despite problems encountered during the production and even more so during post-production, the film will now be released. After the opening minutes of &quot;George&quot;, it should be clear to anybody that it is time to cast aside expectations of seeing LotR&apos;s little brother, the skateboarding monk reveals that this film does not take itself seriously at all or does it just emulate a certain elf surfing shields? The film thrives on the performances of its main cast and possesses a simply but entertaining plotline. The quirky humour that  springs up every now and then reminds one of &quot;Willow&quot; and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; but does not harm as much as entertain. 7/10"

Her best friends are co-worker Sarah Walker (Lucy Punch), pregnant Renee Blair (Rosemarie DeWitt) and gay neighbor Peter Cooper (Romany Malco). She feels sick and goes to see Dr. Julian Goldstein (Gael García Bernal). While under, she sees God (Whoopi Goldberg) who gives her three wishes. She wishes to fly, $1 million and something for later. She has late stage colon cancer. Her parents Beverly (Kathy Bates) and Jack (Treat Williams) can&apos;t stop fighting even with their daughter sick. She wins a radio contest to learn hang gliding. Dr. Sanders (Alan Dale) tells her that chemo isn&apos;t working and she goes on a medical trial. She finally tells her boss Rob Randolf (Steven Weber) and he tells her about a million dollar payout from the life insurance. Peter sets her up with gigolo escort Vinnie (Peter Dinklage) nicknamed Little Bit of Heaven.\n\nIs it really a bad thing to cross a cutesy rom-com with cancer? The critics seem to think so. I don&apos;t judge it like that. This is by no means perfect. Whoopi Goldberg as God is distracting as hell. Gael García Bernal is not fully committed to being a bad English speaker. He should really throw in a lot of Spanish. Kate Hudson is at home with these silly rom-coms. Her flightiness is more of a defense mechanism so I don&apos;t really take it as cutesy. The cancer stuff allows the movie to transition to heartfelt seriousness although it&apos;s very jarring sometimes. The tone is a tricky thing in this movie and it does struggle. However I don&apos;t mind treating cancer with a lighter tone.",

      "reviewBody": "Theorising that &apos;free labour&apos; would destroy capitalism, engineer Jim Ripple (S.M. Vecheslov) creates giant mechanical workers. Human workers protest being displaced leading to a confrontation with the military, who try to use the robots as soldiers to supress the uprising. Despite purity of initial intent, Ripple soon breaks with workers (including his father) and becomes a tool of the military-industrial complex, only to be thwarted by the clever and resourceful proletariat. Although where the story occurs is never explicitly stated, resplendent military officers, top-hatted capitalists, glaring neon signs, and bourgeois dance clubs pretty much puts the pin in the USA (or perhaps the USSR&apos;s newly fascist neighbour to the west). The message is unsubtle, especially when the workers&apos; protest is put down by gunfire in a scene similar to (but in much smaller scale) the massacre on the Odessa Steps in &apos;Battleship Potemkin&apos; (1925). &apos;Loss of Sensation&apos; is quite slow-moving at times, with a lengthy interlude at a nightclub (including a musical number), but the ending is worth waiting for. The robots are classic 1930&apos;s mechanical monsters (although they are a bit slow and lumbering to really be seen as a threat). Oddly, the robots are emblazoned with &apos;RUR&apos; (for &apos;Ripple&apos;s Universal Robots&apos;), despite the fact the story is not based on Karel Capek&apos;s famous 1920 play &apos;R.U.R&apos; (Rossums Universal Robots) but rather the adapted from the Ukrainian novel &apos;Iron Riot&apos; (1929). The acting is a bit melodramatic (consistent with the thickly laid-on message) but the robot effects are great (in a &apos;retro&apos; sort of way - the robots could easily be on the cover of a 1930&apos;s &apos;Amazing Stories&apos; magazine), as is the cinematography in general. There is an odd gimmick by which the robots are controlled by sound, which sets up a somewhat delirious scene where Ripple is surrounded by &apos;dancing&apos; robots, while playing on his saxophone (strangely the scene is not set to sax music but rather to ominous orchestral music). Not many science fiction films were made in the USSR in the &apos;30s (apparently the genre was frowned upon by the Party censors) but &apos;Loss of Sensation&apos; may have gotten green-lighted because its &apos;triumph of the workers&apos; message is pure Soviet ideological shtick (interestingly, at least one academic (David Christopher) has hypothesized that the film might be sneakily subversive, with Ripple representing Stalin and the robots representing workers abused under the emasculating cult of the Supreme Soviet). There appears to be a variety of translations and alternative titles on-line (the film is also known as &apos;RUR: The Robots of Jim Ripl&apos;). I watched a subtitled version on You-tube that was reasonably good although the subtitles had a number of spelling and punctuation errors.",

      "reviewBody": "Vengeance, or so the saying goes, is a dish best served cold. This film certainly exemplifies this maxim, and in the process comes across as if Bergman had done Deathwish. (Thriller&apos;s director had actually worked as on Persona as an assistant, and indeed some of the Nordic glumness here reminds one of the greater director) Its one of those titles which, long unavailable to the interested viewer, provokes a huge amount of curiosity and its arrival on DVD with some useful extras, is to be welcomed. It also has the cool cachet of a recommendation by Quentin Tarantino, who for purposes of reference duly inserted a one-eyed assassin of his own into Kill Bill.\n\nSeen today Thriller remains a striking film, even much of the shock value has evaporated - apart from the hard core sequences as the heroine, by now a unwilling heroine addict, is abused and degraded. These moments were a principal reason for the film&apos;s truncation for the States and elsewhere, even though now they seem part and parcel of the message, reinforcing the intimate distress of what is being done. In fact apart from the opening and discreetly filmed child rape, as well as the assault on Madeline&apos;s eyeball about a third of the way in, there&apos;s hardly much action at all - and which when it does appear, given director Vibenius&apos; infatuation with slow-mo violence (interesting at first, avant garde when continued, a tad tedious when it carries on) tends to slow matters down considerably. Much of the fighting is done in this same manner, and while the drawn out bullet ballets piercing shirts lead to certain fascination, the technique also shows up the cheap special effects on offer, or distractingly emphasises the illogicality of bodies recoiling *into* bullets and actors reacting too slowly to the impact. But whether deliberately or not such trick effects distance the viewer from the emotions of events; instead the mechanics of retaliation and murder are drawn out in almost fetishistic fashion, just as Madeline will savour coldly the extended demise of Tony in the closing scenes.\n\nOn the plus side the deliberate nature of it all, and the slow build up to Madeline&apos;s revenge, gives the audience ample time to side with the central character and contemplate the stages of her increasing torment. And during the wait, her enforced silence communicates far more than acres of embittered dialogue might have. The result is a degree of audience sympathy that&apos;s quite a way from the usual exploitation product, and by virtue of the fact that sometimes less means more, accumulates considerably more dignity for the victim along the way. There&apos;s still plenty of 70&apos;s cheesy decor on show (Madeline&apos;s principal abuser and abductor, Tony, in particular recalls a sleazy Jason King) but the film is distinguished by its refusal to hurry and draws out the angst suffered by the main character with quiet understatement, an effective process which gets under the skin.\n\nIts a film worth seeing for this rather unique flavour; whether or not it will repay repeated viewings is less certain as, apart from Christine Lindberg&apos;s stoic performance, non of the other actors make much of an impression. Director Vibernius, who apparently took on this production to pay for the flop of his last, only made one more film after this, the even more exploitative Breaking Point. In Thriller, where perhaps he succeeded for the only time in creating a near art house style for grind house subject matter, he also appears as a hot dog salesman."

This is a truly worthwhile script that can be done better, perhaps even better than the original. I&apos;d like to see that."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (Archie Mayo, 1936) is most fascinating for its eager willingness to voice criticisms of wealth, power, authority, and inequality in America. Perhaps its acute social commentary should be unsurprising considering that Warner Brothers released the romantic crime drama during the depths of the Great Depression, but it is freshly relevant just the same, striking a note that would not be witnessed in the films of the forties and fifties. In speaking to the exploitation of workers, the snobbery of corporatism, the repression of women, blacks, artists, and literary poets, the reign of gangland crime, the American government&apos;s complicit abuse of power, and the loss of individuality in an increasingly meek age, &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; manages an equal-opportunity iconoclasm that belies any party affiliations. Simply put, the film is unafraid to criticize America, and it&apos;s that sense of freedom that makes it particularly delightful. Best of all, &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; voices its dissent through colorful witticisms and engaging banter, never taking itself too seriously or losing its sense of humor. \n\n&quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; is also particularly notable for marking Humphrey Bogart&apos;s first major screen role as the nominal villain and escaped gangster Duke Mantee. The unshaven, pompadour-sporting Bogart is leering and menacing, brooding and growling and glowering, projecting the lonely, hard-bitten cynicism that would soon become his trademark. At the same time, however, he also emerges as a sympathetic and noble figure, one who transcends his criminal trappings through a fierce sense of integrity and individuality. Not only did these hard-boiled character traits become the template for the Bogart persona, but they also serve as a source of magnetism within the film&apos;s social milieu. Aside from the corporate oilman (Mr. Chisholm, played by Paul Harvey), Duke Mantee&apos;s hostages in a desert diner come to admire and salute his rugged individualism and defiance of the status quo, even as he endangers their lives. They yearn for the empowering resistance that he embodies and the gritty social rebelliousness that he wears on his prickly face, and when the film, before its final shootout, labels the confrontation as &quot;Duke Mantee vs. the American government,&quot; it&apos;s clear that the sympathies of its principal characters reside with the Duke. \n\n&quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; is also noteworthy for the dynamic contrast between its two black characters. One of them (Joseph, played by John Alexander) is virtually the embodiment of the pre-sixties Hollywood stereotype, a meek, shuffling, subservient chauffeur who always looks to his wealthy boss for paternalistic approval before opening his mouth. The other (Slim, played by Slim Thompson) is one of Duke Mantee&apos;s gangster associates, and he&apos;s clearly a liberated, autonomous, independent soul who offers his opinions on his own accord while mocking his &quot;colored brother&quot; for his subservience. He&apos;s almost a figure out of 1966 rather than 1936, and the difference between these two black men highlights the social conflict that the film heeds. On one side is the ruggedly individualistic and socially defiant Duke Mantee and a black man who marches to his own beat; on the other is a fat cat corporate tycoon and his docile and emasculated black servant, who, in turn, represent the American status quo. And so while Mantee and his gangsters are nominally the villains of &quot;The Petrified Forest,&quot; at heart they constitute the film&apos;s heroes and rousing saviors. They are the men who obliquely brighten the hopeless despair and repressed frustrations of a trapped waitress who is secretly a talented painter (Gabby Maple, played by Bette Davis) and a fatalistically passionate French drifter-poet who is hitching his way to the Pacific Ocean (Alan Squier, played by Leslie Howard). They also seem to enliven several of the other repressed characters, from the restless wife of the cowardly tycoon (Mrs. Edith Chisholm, played by Genevieve Tobin), to an ex-college football player struggling to release his pent-up energies (Nick, played by Eddie Acuff), to an old man who longs for Billy the Kid, Mark Twain, and the legendary individualists of a bygone era (Gramp Maple, played by Charley Grapewin). \n\nTo be sure, the film doesn&apos;t explicitly paint Duke Mantee and his fellow gangsters as heroic saviors, but it&apos;s clear where the film&apos;s sympathies lie.\n\nUltimately &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; is about an umbrella of misfits and their discontent with the repressive and exploitative American establishment, and it&apos;s that pulse of iconoclasm that keeps it audacious and provocative after all these decades."

This particular mishmash, a comedy/triller about stolen jewels, is a pointless (and a songless) b-picture, which can not be redeemed even by glimpse of bare brests, owned by a very beautiful anonymous fan dancer. It fails to take off, and you shouldn&apos;t toy with it unless you are absolutely fluent in German - there are no subtitles."

It&apos;s a fairly watchable thriller for most of the running time, mostly due to Nivola and Witherspoon giving muted performances. But the problem with this kind of thing is that it just isn&apos;t clever enough to really outsmart the audience. It isn&apos;t necessarily that you know what&apos;s coming, but the fact that you know SOMETHING is coming, some kind of twist, that it has to be pretty off the wall to take you in. Unfortunately, here the movie plunges into farce and it&apos;s a let down after an often tense, and well calculated build-up.\n\nStill, Nivola is always nice to watch :-)"

      "reviewBody": "A very nifty, Dali-esque credit sequence ushers us in to a film full of atmosphere and dread, but just fall short of the mark of being a great film. Still, I&apos;m glad I stumbled upon it.\n\nIn a Croatian town young writer Ivan is struggling to make ends meet, and no one cares, because everyone else is struggling to make ends meet too. The country is going through a very bad economical downturn and Ivan has been forced to try and sell his books on the streets, and it is in this flea market that he meets mysterious girl Sonja. Sonja shows him kindness by giving him her scarf, but during a protest on the street the two become separated and Ivan go to the park to sleep on a bench, having been evicted earlier that day...\n\nIvan must have one of those faces, because even though the patrolman in the park tells him he can&apos;t sleep on a bench, he does show him a huge empty bank that he can use for a few nights, as long as he keeps his mouth shut about it. Ivan agrees, and accessing the bank via a sewer grate, he finds an empty office to bed down in. He&apos;s too hungry to wonder why someone has stashed a huge amount of food in one of the cupboards, and is also delighted to find that the phone still works, which means he can try and track down Sonja. \n\nIt&apos;s about this point I started wondering if anything was going to happen and it was about this point that the director flew from Croatia to my house, kicked down my front door, rushed into the living room and hoofed me in the nuts, shouting &quot;YES, something is going to happen.&quot; And he was right! Hearing music, Ivan creeps through the bank to find what looks like a huge dinner party/orgy going on in the main entrance, only some of these people look a bit...odd. About two minutes later, everyone is called to stand before a shadowy figure who we soon find out intends to take over the world...someone who thrives in poverty and disease. Der Rattengott!\n\nIt&apos;s a kind of They Live situation involving rats, with Ivan finding himself joining up with a very small group of people going up against an increasingly large amount of rat humans who love getting jobs within the civil service. Paranoia also sets in as it turns out they can imitate people Ivan knows. Can he find a way out or is he rat nuggets? My kids have two rats, I wonder what they would have made of this one if they weren&apos;t more intent in climbing up my trousers and punching me in the scrotum for a laugh.\n\nIt looks like there wasn&apos;t much of budget for this one but it&apos;s good to watch the increasingly paranoid Ivan trying to get around town without losing his marbles. The rat/human effects are that great though, but the film&apos;s atmosphere is dark and broody. The only problem is that there&apos;s maybe too much brooding and not enough munching, as following the initial discovery of the rat people, things don&apos;t get manic enough. Still, it&apos;s short and well worth sitting down for.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the &quot;man behind the curtain&quot; is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent).\n\nLike the second entry in the series, I wished Paul Greengrass&apos; shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. However, that being said, it&apos;s a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I&apos;ll be damned if it isn&apos;t a blast to watch them get there.\n\nWith the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. Still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the &quot;Identity&quot; and the &quot;Supremacy&quot;, this &quot;Ultimatum&quot; reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne&apos;s past. It&apos;s an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, this is pretty insane stuff even by IFD standards!\n\nThe plot concerns the Thunder project which has produced a formula that can increase the physical proportions of both plant life and animals to between 300 and 1000 times their original size! Of course, such a scientific breakthrough inevitably attracts the nefarious attentions of a terrorist group led by a chap named Solomon who needless to say, promptly orders his cronies to procure the formula by any means necessary.\n\nAs it happens, the attempted seizure of the breakthrough is a failure and the formula ends up in the hands of a little girl......and her intelligent pet snake(!) Well, you can probably guess what happens next..... Yep, said snake grows.....and grows.....and GROWS! By the end of the film the bloody thing is as big as a skyscraper and has caused untold damage to everything around it.\n\nIn between all these giant snake shenanigans we find another sub plot i.e. newly edited in footage, involving Pierre Kirby of Full Metal Ninja and Zombie vs Ninja fame trying to track down Solomon; Cue a few fun to watch shoot outs and martial arts scenes as our man takes out Solomon&apos;s lackeys first.\n\nIf it sounds strange on paper then it&apos;s nothing compared to how it transpires on screen! Whilst this is far from the most enjoyable output to spring forth from the IFD stables, it certainly figures as one of the most absurd (which is saying a lot!)\n\nFellow bad movie fans take note!",

      "reviewBody": "Being from a particular region in a country like India comes with its goods and not so goods. People from one part of the nation don&apos;t necessarily always know of the legendary works of art that happen in another place. Like people in Orissa being unaware of the deep rooted humanitarian movies that come out of the Tamil movie industry or folks in Kerala not aware of some genuinely wonderful pieces of cinema from West Bengal. One cant do too much about this divide given that the Herculean and almost obnoxious presence of &apos;Bollywood&apos; continues to act as the fort that isolates several pockets of creative work in their own shells. Sad but true.\n\nThen there are some film makers whose movies transcend language and region. Film makers like the late Academy Award winner Satyajit Ray sa&apos;ab. OK - I will admit. Except for a few brief scenes from &apos;Pather Panchali&apos; I have not seen any other movie of this great man. Reason? Well, either it was the lack of the need to have to sit through a language I know nothing of and having to squint at the badly framed English subtitles or it was just plain desi callousness that believes the majority is usually right. You know, the classic Indian thinking that has the &apos;if everyone says it then it has to be great&apos; attitude peppered all over it. I am sure there are millions out there who will still tell you that Satyajit Ray was an amazing movie maker without having seen a single frame he might have shot. Considering I too have indulged in such blatancy every now and then, &apos;Shatranj Ke Khiladi&apos; seemed like the only chance I would get to savor Mr. Ray&apos;s cinematic beauty. After all, it was indeed the only Hindi/Urdu movie he made in his life, isn&apos;t it? Hence when I found the chance I took it.\n\nSet in the late 1800s in the then Hindustan &apos;Shatranj Ke Khiladi&apos; runs with two main stories parallel to one another. One – the larger of the two which shows a determinedly boorish English General Outram (a much younger looking Sir Richard Attenborough) pitted against Awadh&apos;s incompetent yet culturally aware Mughal King Wajid Ali Shah (a generously rotund Amjad Khan). The company wants to take over Awadh which remains the final province that is still run by royalty. So it decides to look past a decade old treaty that had promised that Awadh&apos;s royalty would never be lost. But, knowing the way the company ruled the sub-continent, the poetically humane King&apos;s defiance is brought under test as the concubine infested regal refuses to budge from his throne.\n\nThe second interestingly laid out strand is that of old buddies Mirza Sajjad Ali (a wonderfully flawless Sanjeev Kumar) and Mir Roshan Ali (an effervescent Saeed Jaffrey). These two upper middle class noblemen who sit around all day sucking at their well made hookahs and ignoring their frustrated spouses are absolutely obsessed with the game of chess. It is as if nothing – not even the lack of pawns to play with – can stop them from going at it well and good for a few hours each day. While Sajjad Ali&apos;s wife (Shabana Azmi is a small but well placed role) decides to find solace in the housekeeper&apos;s stories, Roshan Ali&apos;s wife (a chubby and visibly mischievous Fareeda Jalaal) chooses to find solace in the arms of a much younger man (a nervous Farooque Shaikh) right under the nose of her unsuspecting husband.\n\nRay beautifully juxtaposes the story of two chess players with the moves that take over their province and their lives as a foreign power enters their land. While the King is confronted by the orders of the Union Jack under the umbrella of the soulful songs he has composed, the chess players continue to find ways to get a good spot to sit down and well - play a good round of chess. A game, as it turns out, that ends up putting their friendship at stake just like the throne of their clueless King.\n\nThe one thing that comes off as obviously as the attention to pretentious &apos;paan holders&apos; by these Lucknawi laat saahebs is Ray&apos;s understanding of the human condition in those times. The beautiful focus to detail of the surroundings only amplify the saga that unfolds eventually while the red vested British army marches into the Awadh province. Cinematography is crisp and captures the fading lights of the royal reign quite effectively. What struck me as more amazing was Ray&apos;s wonderful acknowledgement to the way such potentially affluent cultures used to work during that era. The fact that people in them would rather spend more time on keeping their indulgences alive than worry about their future under the Raj was an eye opener to say the least.\n\nPerformances wise everyone does his/her bit effectively. Seasoned actors Sanjeev and Saeed chip in a beautiful contribution. A young Amjad Khan (still fresh from the finely baked success as &apos;Gabbar Singh&apos; in Sholay) delivers an earnest performance as the King who has his heart in the right place but his head in the wrong spot. As mentioned earlier, a tight lipped Sir Attenborough with a fluent Tom Alter play the scheming Englishmen who are preparing for Awadh&apos;s fall with orders from Her majesty the Queen.\n\nAll said and done &apos;Shatranj Ke Khiladi&apos; definitely stands out as a Ray classic that is truly a testament to his life as a master story teller. I am glad that even if this is the only movie I will ever watch of Mr. Ray then at least it is based on a story by the legendary Shri Munshi Premchand. Could there be a better example of two Hindus coming together to design such a sensitive and relevant epic about the Muslim reign and culture? Unlikely, according to me.",

      "reviewBody": "Sexcomedies or comedy dramas about human sexuality are very difficult to make. Either they become too lowbrow or not enough explicit so that the movie-going audience will feel satisfied.\n\nThis film is really an example who bad things can really be in the world of comedy. Flat dialogue, flawed storyline and scenes that lead up to nothing.\n\nStory is about a young yuppie couple who are having some difficulties in their sexlife. They move to a new neighbourhood where their nextdoor neighbours are family of freewheeling hippies, that love gardening.\n\nSoon these two families will learn from each other....\n\nSwedish comedy films have rarely been any good, with few exceptions. And things aren&apos;t very good here.\n\nThe screenwriters and the director really wants to explore human sexuality, relationships, middle-class society but ends up doing low brow comedy that would make Andrew Dice Clay red in the face.\n\nSome nudity but done in a very boring, clinical fashion. Non European viewers may be chocked over frontal nudity but europeans will be sligthly bored.\n\nSo watch Human Nature (2001), Teeth (2007), Lucía y el sexo (2001), Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) instead.\n\nEven highly flawed films like Sirens (1993), The Oh in Ohio (2006)is better then this."

Must a great movie be slick, artificially lit and laboriously plotted?\n\nHeat is an honest and hilarious portrayal of dysfunction, ugliness and despair with comedic innocence at its core. It is a visionary look into the souls of the much-less-than-beautiful people in a sun-bleached setting where poverty and suicide lurk just around the corner to glamor (glamor that is only parodied by the impoverishment of the production). At the height of their improbability, the characters are more real, more vivid and enigmatic than 99.9% of Hollywood factory fare. In the moments of their most wooden acting, the fascinations of the real person - whether it be the gapingly numb Joe Dallesandro, the ogrishly preening Pat Ast or the gonzo mystery of Andrea Feldmen, emerges with overexposed brilliance.\n\nSylvia Miles plays her role with subtlety and iconic ugliness. She is not trying to look &quot;marketable,&quot; as so many do, but to play a part as naturally as a spirited animal defecating in a forest. There is rarely an ending so original in a film, too - the impotence of further tragedy in an already so tragic film. Burning through the most awkward of 70s fashion and through its slick rivals with fashion-model actors, Heat is raw psychological meat on an open flame.",

The acting is acceptable, and one can only marvel at the innovative way the film is made on such a low budget.\n\nI was laughing, crying, dismaying, basically this film makes the viewer go through a gamut of emotions.\n\nI think this film should be essential viewing for anyone interested in colonialism, racism, immigration, and last but not least, African cinema.",

It is a more serious than usual role for both Madonna and Rupert Everett, and they both did very well. It is touching and funny, and might have suffered 9 years ago because the viewing public was not ready for the very realistic portrayal of these complicated questions about who is really &quot;family&quot; and why.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Nayak&apos; starts with two news headlines about movie star Arindham (Uttam Kumar). One headline states that Arindham got involved in a brawl and the other states his nomination for a prestigious award. While travelling to Delhi by train (in order to receive the award) he comes across various people including a young simple but modern journalist Aditi (Sharmila Tagore) to whom he confides his inner thoughts. In the process, the actor further discovers himself and his fear. Aditi too is moved as her prejudice against the cocky pompous movie star changes while she discovers the man behind the name.\n\nRay cleverly tells Arindham&apos;s story about how he made it to stardom, his sacrifice of his art, loss of friends leading to isolation, fear of failure, seeking comfort in alcohol, his inner conflict...He weaves it all into a screenplay that takes place during a train trip from Calcutta to Delhi. A lot of it is shown in flashback mode. The dream sequences are another example of fine writing and execution. We&apos;re also given a brief view of the corrupt world of cinema, how art is long lost and how it&apos;s become all about money, fame and name...very relevant and applicable to today&apos;s Indian film industry.\n\nUttan Kumar, being the biggest star in Bengali Cinema perfectly fits the part. One wonders how much of the character resembles Kumar in real life. Though Ray is known to cast Soumitra Chatterjee (who happened to be Kumar&apos;s arch rival) in most of his films, he made the correct decision by casting Kumar for I cannot imagine anyone else play the part. Sharmila Tagore is wonderful. The actress has an amazing presence and with her grace, simplicity and sincerity, she shines. &apos;Loved her scenes with Uttam.\n\nLike most of Ray&apos;s powerful work, &apos;Nayak&apos; is a rather less known but remarkable film. One of my favorites!"

This film is skillfully directed by Peter Medak who gets more that even he probably bargained from a solid cast of actors, a wonderful script, and one great-looking eerie old house.  Medak creates tons of suspense with the barest sight of blood.  This film reeks atmosphere.  The house reeks atmosphere.  Scott&apos;s performance and that of veteran Melvyn Douglass reek atmosphere.  Doors creak, balls mysteriously bounce, water runs, windows break in the old house trying to tell Scott about the secret of a young child that once lived there.  The script is fanciful yet well-written and very creative.  Scott gives an atypically subdued performance that suggests passion, heartbreak, and tenacity.  The rest of the performers are very good too.  I cannot remember the last time Mr. Douglass gave a poor performance. Some of the scenes that really stand out in my mind are flashback sequences showing the terrible secret that has been hidden in the house for over 70 years.  Medak doesn&apos;t have a huge budget to work with here, but this movie beats out newer haunted house films like the remake of The Haunting by leaps and bounds.  This is one classy scare film!"

But even as the three hours and seven minutes passed, I didn&apos;t take my eyes off the television. If the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogies weren&apos;t enough to persuade you, now is the time for everyone to agree that Peter Jackson is one of the most imaginative individuals to ever hold the director&apos;s chair. This movie belongs to a unique class. Everyone who attempts to replicate &quot;King Kong&quot; should be imprisoned in a rubber room.\n\nThen, you cram this classic remake with moving humanity, astounding amazing effects, and a ton of unforgettable imagery, and you do it all so flawlessly that it&apos;s bound to become a classic as well. In a word, Jackson&apos;s &quot;King Kong&quot; is amazing, fantastic, beautiful, and spectacular. I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t put it into one word.",

      "reviewBody": "John Wayne and sidekick Syd Saylor are heading from Montana to Wyoming to the ranch of Wayne&apos;s cousin Johnny Mack Brown. Wayne&apos;s a cocky sort, fancies himself a great lady&apos;s man and poker player. The Duke even in his later and more irascible years usually didn&apos;t have parts that called for that, but here he does show that side of his character and shows it well.\n\nWayne moves in on Marsha Hunt who is Brown&apos;s girl friend. That does throw a monkey wrench into the relationship between the cousins. Later on at the hands of cardsharps Monte Blue and James Craig, Wayne gets himself in quite a hole. \n\nJohnny Mack Brown had an interesting career. He was an All American back for the Crimson Tide of Alabama before Paul Bryant took over the team. He opted for a Hollywood career and appeared opposite stars like Mary Pickford and Greta Garbo in silents. His Alabama drawl made him a natural for westerns and he was grinding out the B films just like the Duke was at this time. This is their only film together and they both complement each other&apos;s persona well.\n\nAlthough another great football player Jim Thorpe has a bit role in this film, some lists have Alan Ladd in the cast. I have to say that I examined it frame by frame and there&apos;s no trace of Mr. Ladd.\n\nEven without Ladd it&apos;s a passably good B western, could have used some better editing, but better than some of what Wayne was doing at Monogram at the time.",

So you can give a film a very good rating for one aspect, and a very bad rating for a second aspect, and so on. The main-question is: Are you entertained, or even better informed about something, by this film ? &apos;Das Superweib&apos; may be characterized as having a weak plot (or a bad execution of a worthy plot, or a not very original plot), but at the same time it&apos;s a very good showcase for the mannerisms of its actors and actresses, if you are interested in German films and actors. You learn something about the characteristic traits of those in Germany well-known actors that you can see in their other films as well. And very many of them appear in this film, although some of them only as cameos, too short for that(Armin Rohde, for example).But with most of them you can judge for yourself, if a certain actor may be interesting for you in other films as well, or if you don&apos;t like his/her mannerisms and looks. And the film is well-made in order to get those impressions,in terms of surroundings, camera-work and everything belonging to it,not only sufficient, but very good. And it&apos;s an interesting picture of an atmosphere typical for its time, and may be historically interesting in the future..... just as seeing Liselotte Pulver again, who long ago,in the Nineteen-Fifties, acted in films that are now similarly interesting in historical terms.",

One thing is for sure, if an Anthology movie is only as good as it&apos;s weakest link/story, than this would be really bad (the story covering the whole thing is tedious, boring and annoying at best)! But I don&apos;t think that it would do the short movies justice that accompany the movie.\n\nI actually enjoyed most of them. They don&apos;t make sense as usual when it comes to Found Footage (why would they film that again? The who cut/edited them is either easy to answer or makes even less sense, depending on the way you look at it), but the stories themselves are mostly decent. Acting is good to OK (apart from the &quot;covering&quot; overall story as mentioned) and the scares are decent too. I still don&apos;t get the fascination with Found footage and I sure can&apos;t tell you why this spawned a sequel ...",

      "reviewBody": "Johnny Weissmuller&apos;s final film as &apos;King of the Jungle&apos;, after 16 years in the role, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans. At 44, the ex-Olympian, one of Hollywood&apos;s most active &apos;party animals&apos;, was long past the slim athleticism of his youth, and looked tired (although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry, TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS).\n\nNot only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the quintessential &apos;Boy&apos;, had grown to manhood (he was a strapping 17-year old), so he was written out of the script, under the pretext of being &apos;away at school&apos;. Brenda Joyce, at 35, was appearing in her fourth of five films as &apos;Jane&apos; (she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, in 1949&apos;s TARZAN&apos;S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever.\n\nProduced by Sol Lesser, at RKO, on a minuscule budget, the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively, incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story.\n\nWhen a young island girl (Tyrone Power&apos;s future bride, Linda Christian) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan, he learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of filmdom&apos;s most enduring villains) had virtually enslaved the local population, threatening retribution from a living &apos;God&apos; if they don&apos;t do his bidding. The girl had been chosen to become the &apos;God&apos;s&apos; bride, so she fled. Faster than you can say &apos;Is this a dumb plot or WHAT?&apos;, the girl is kidnapped by the priest&apos;s henchmen and returned to the island, and Tarzan, followed by Jane, colorful Spanish character &apos;Benjy&apos; (charmingly played by John Laurenz, who sings several tunes), and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the &apos;God&apos; is simply a con man in an Aztec mask, working with the priest in milking the island&apos;s rich pearl beds), a bit of brawling action, and comic relief and songs by Benjy, everything reaches the expected happy conclusion.\n\nRemarkably, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, and is far better than what you&apos;d expect from this &apos;B&apos; movie! \n\nWhile the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to Weissmuller&apos;s time in Tarzan&apos;s loincloth (he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man, in khakis), the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been.\n\nTarzan was about to get a make over, and become much sexier...",

      "reviewBody": "Eureka is the kind of film you think you&apos;ll hate unless you give it a fair shake. It is a interplay between many characters, much like a soap opera. It works only if you take a general interest in the trivialities of each character. Jack McCann (Hackman) is the center of the film. His life is all about the gold he felt he earned, and the principle that he will never have any partners to share a percentage with. His life is ravaged by Mayakofsky (Pesci) and his henchmen. Charles Perkins, a friend of Jack&apos;s spent much of the movie trying to warn him that these men were dangerous. Jack&apos;s dilemma wasn&apos;t that he was waiting for his death, but the fact that he thought he was invincible. Being stubborn and set in his ways, Jack refused to give in to Mayakofsky. Jack was a man preoccupied with gold, but not loveless. He seemed to love all the women in his life. Also his daughter, Spacey Tracy. A loose young woman married to Claude (Hauer). Tracy had her head in the clouds, and wanted to live in a fantasy world. She did not provoke the fights between her father and Claude, but instigated them. She wanted Claude to fight as a proof of his love. Claude was most elusive. You never get his angle. If he loved Tracy or was just using her. She even used the witness stand as a way of finding out where Claude stood with her instead of pinning for the guilty ones involved in the tragic end of her father. (Claude did his own defense in court!) The movie has it&apos;s funny points. Like the dinner table scene at the McCann&apos;s where Jack makes some insulting remarks to the guests. Some of the best scenes involve Aurelio D&apos;Amato, played by Mickey Rourke. He&apos;s cast in another glossed over film where he is perfect, but forgotten. D&apos;Amato is a yiddish associate of Mayakofsky. And one of the main guys pestering Jack to sign the Luna Bay deal.(Mayakofsky wanted to build a casino on it.) There are scenes where D&apos;Amato is begging Jack to sign. His baby face and soft voice should have gotten the devil to sign the document, but Jack wasn&apos;t so easy. Rourke&apos;s performance alone is reason enough to see this movie. And its not surprising he has a night with Tracy. Tracy loved Claude, but how could she resist D&apos;Amato? Eureka is more of a film about the desires of man. Each character wants something, and they spend the entire film in pursuit of those things."

      "reviewBody": "For years, I put off watching this version of Shakespeare&apos;s classic love story, knowing that all the main players were about thirty years too old for their roles. Finally, when the film came on late on night, I decided to take a look, because I do admire the work of so many of the players.\n\nProvided you can put aside the problems of the ages of the actors, the result is a very pleasant surprise. The biggest surprise for me was the performance of Norma Shearer - I&apos;ve always liked her work, but considered her rather lightweight for Shakespeare. Not so - she delivered her lines with a great feel for the style and pace, and was as delightful and open a Juliet as one could wish. Her age became irrelevant; this was a young girl new to love, completely swept off her feet and ready to surrender all - for the first time.\n\nLeslie Howard was also comfortable with the Shakespearean dialogue, if slightly lacking the boyish passion we rightly expect to see. He was more the slightly older suitor, taken by surprise with the fresh appeal of his Juliet, but ready to cast aside previous attachments to pursue and win her. His lovely voice delivered the lines with ease and fluency.\n\nJohn Barrymore&apos;s Mercutio was much more the ageing playboy than the dashing young blade, but his sure touch with the dialogue showed clearly why he was considered the preeminent Shakespearean actor of his day in America. His delivery of the &quot;Queen Mab&quot; speech was a delight. His body was way too old, but his spirit lacked nothing.\n\nFlora Robson came near to stealing most of her scenes, as she so often did, and Basil Rathbone was fully at home in the role of Tybalt; fine performances from these two, as we would expect from their backgrounds.\n\nIt was, to my mind, rather over-produced, with the actors in danger of being lost in the expansive sets, but remembering that had these actors been performing on stage, we wouldn&apos;t bat an eyelid at their ages, they provide us with an engrossing experience and deliver a play that even the experts couldn&apos;t fault.",

Visions of Eight serves as an artists interpretation of these concepts with the games serving only as the backdrop to explore those themes. If that sounds like something you&apos;d like, there&apos;s no movie better than this one.",

      "reviewBody": "The Korean War always suffers badly in comparison to others such as World War II. It was never terribly popular in the United States, even less so here in Canada, I understand. Korea didn&apos;t have a Pearl Harbor to get American backs up and creative juices flowing. Western countries had been busy demilitarizing when North Korea made the decision to invade. Korea represented a 180° turn.\n\nThe commercial Hollywood film output covering that period reflected society&apos;s overall ambivalence, with tired themes, generally retreads from World War II. Screenwriting required more than just a change of locale to give it inspiration.\n\nThe best of the lot is probably &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (1954), where bravery combined with hopelessness and doom creates an effect which seems to anticipate Vietnam.\n\nLast night at Toronto&apos;s Short Film Festival we had a rare opportunity to see John Ford&apos;s &quot;This Is Korea!&quot;. We were especially lucky since author Dan Ford was there to introduce his grandfather&apos;s work and to answer questions.\n\nWhile John Ford&apos;s documentary is not quite the film Korea has been missing, it is close to it, or as close as we are likely to come.\n\nIt compares well to Frank Capra&apos;s &quot;Why We Fight&quot; films, his propaganda series from World War II. There is the same happy balance between combat and comfortable civilian footage. There are villagers going about their business, children playing with sleds, kids getting vaccinations. Soldiers receive mail or hit the chow line to celebrate Christmas with steak dinner. Capra and his production unit successfully contrasted the War&apos;s goal -- represented by civilian footage -- with the means to that end -- combat footage -- and Ford uses the same technique. Urgency is added by shots of refugees and orphans.\n\nCapra&apos;s films always have a strong educational purpose; that is largely absent from Ford&apos;s. Capra&apos;s films use stock footage and animation to illustrate an historical chain of incidents leading to the present. Korea does not lend itself well to that approach, but Ford has a better reason for not adopting it:\n\nNo stock footage!\n\nFord&apos;s film uses new material almost exclusively, brand new and in colour. The colour brings an immediacy which footage about the infantry would generally not have until Vietnam. (I do recognize that there are exceptional black &amp; white World War II films like &quot;The Battle of San Pietro&quot;, for example.)\n\nThere is an unaccustomed realism here. The Koreans wear national costume on occasion, something they never did on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. The Koreans even look Korean; the &quot;Koreans&quot; at the 4077 were Chinese half the time.\n\nBut the combat footage here really stands out: artillery, mortars, rockets, night-time naval gunfire. When a bomb lands nearby, the camera shakes. Bombs often land nearby. Houses burst into coloured flame. Advances take place over authentic wintry Korean mountains. You shiver right along with the racially integrated GIs and the North Korean POWs standing in that frigid wind. &quot;Remember Valley Forge?&quot; is the narrator&apos;s rhetorical question. Walter Huston would have had that line in a Capra film.\n\nWhen the narrator says, &quot;This is Korea, chums. This is Korea&quot;, the viewer doesn&apos;t doubt it for a moment. When he wonders aloud, &quot;What&apos;s it all about?&quot;, he doesn&apos;t really try to answer. He doesn&apos;t have a flag-waving response for that one.\n\nI was not expecting a film this interesting to come out of the Korean conflict, so perhaps my initial enthusiasm is misjudged. But I hope and expect not.\n\nHollywood made a routine Korean War film in 1952, &quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; with Frank Lovejoy. That film dramatizes the fighting retreat by US Marines from the Chosin Reservoir and includes some actual napalm strikes on snowy hillsides. Those napalm strikes come from the real retreat, as shown right here in &quot;This Is Korea!&quot;, only here they&apos;re not in black &amp; white, and you will find some details Hollywood omitted, like the Marine corpses being dragged through the snow.\n\n&quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; takes its title from the famous quotation by Marine Gen. O.P. Smith (as embellished by some helpful journalists, they say). Gen. Smith appears in this film. It really is the real McCoy.\n\nFord has a great deal of first-class footage and he usually allows it to speak for itself. The narration is mercifully sparse when it isn&apos;t necessary.\n\nAnyone interested in the director&apos;s trademarks will note &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot; being sung at the beginning, much as it would be in other films from this period like &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950) or &quot;Wagonmaster&quot; (same year). Ford shows commendable restraint here with only one song to set the mood.\n\nGiven this films rarity and its quality, it really does warrant a second look.",

      "reviewBody": "Surprisingly effective low-budget horror film about a creep (Martin Kosleck) on an isolated island trying to replicate Nazi experiments with flesh-eating organisms. A pilot transporting an alcoholic actress and her assistant is forced to make an emergency landing on the island and business picks up from there. A good B horror flick with some nice cinematography and special effects that were gory for the time. Despite its budgetary limitations it&apos;s pretty neat. Most of the movie takes place in one location, on a beach. Several moments of unintended hilarity, such as Byron Sanders&apos; character talking about his ex (&quot;I actually loved that little tramp.&quot;) or every scene involving Ray Tudor&apos;s beatnik (I&apos;m comin&apos;, my people, I&apos;m comin&apos;!&quot;). Sexy Barbara Wilkin has a nice scene taking off her shirt to help bandage Sander&apos;s wound. Tame by today&apos;s standards of course. Martin Kosleck is good fun as the mad scientist and the rest of the cast is enjoyable enough. Worth a look even if it isn&apos;t going to change your life.",

      "reviewBody": "Living on an island situated so close to the Italian peninsula, it is small wonder that celebrities emanating from those parts would be a household word in Malta as well and, during my childhood days, no Italian film stars were as popular as Mario Girotti and Carlo PedersolierTerence Hill and Bud Spencer. These two actors  who could roughly be described as the &quot;Laurel &amp; Hardy&quot; of Italian genre movies  have made 17 pictures together between 1968 and 1994 and the film under review is one of their earliest and least-known. They had just hit the big time with the Spaghetti Western spoof THEY CALL ME TRINITY (1970) and it was natural that, after three successive Westerns, producers wanted to try out something else so, here, they decided to not only change genre (to the swashbuckler) but also to have them as rivals instead of partners. Ironically, the new recipe failed to nourish the hungry masses and a sequel to TRINITY was hastily cooked up \n\nApart from the incongruity of seeing the two stars swapping their by-now familiar cowboy garb for the pirate&apos;s feathered-hat and sword, the film itself comes off as a plodding and uninvolving adventure without even the benefit of their usual, protracted cazzotti (fistfights) sequences  save a few tired rehashes of people flying on top of cabinets with a single punch to the jaw! Terence Hill has the title role but is more morose than his usual self here and Bud Spencer is an opposing pirate leader who, true to the seaman&apos;s code, goes down with his ship in the end. Also in the cast are a trio of good-looking dames  Silvia Monti (as the vengeful wife of the Viceroy whom Hill abducts and even gets to bed), Monica Randall (as her companion who eventually joins the pirates&apos; cause) and Jess Franco regular Diana Lorys (who is criminally wasted as a sympathetic innkeeper); the film&apos;s screenwriter George Martin(!) as Hill&apos;s aristocratic partner; Pasquale Basile as the annoying dumb brute typical of such fare; Luciano Pigozzi (hamming it up as another antagonistic pirate leader); and the customary Hollywood has-been generally roped in for such productions for their dubious marquee value: in this case, Edmund Purdom (as the Viceroy). Unfortunately, contrary to all convention, instead of relishing the role of an eye-rolling villain, Purdom underplays the part almost to the point of absentia! \n\nIn spite of the film&apos;s title, it doesn&apos;t seem to have been inspired by the Emilio Salgari (creator of popular heroic figure Sandokan) novel &quot;The Black Pirate&quot;  which, apart from two earlier European film versions, would again be brought to the screen (far more effectively) a mere five years after this one (with TV&apos;s Sandokan himself, Kabir Bedi, in the lead).",

      "reviewBody": "What do Whit Bissel, Donald Murphy and Boris Karloff all have in common? They all played &quot;the last member of the Frankenstein family&quot; within a single year! Boris emoted in Cinemascope in FRANKENSTEIN 1970, Donald Murphy built monsters in a wine cellar in FRANKENSTEIN&apos;S DAUGHTER and Whit Bissel created a teenage monster in the movie I am about to discuss.\n\nAs if most teenagers were not monsters already in their own right Whit decides to build an artificial man out of parts from young healthy teen athletes. To keep his creation under control Whit fixes everything except .. .wait for it . . .the face. The monster (Gary Conway) has the body of a muscleman but a face that, well, looks like it was sculpted out of clay (which it was!) and when he talks he sounds like someone who is, well, talking through a mask!\n\nOkay, this has already been discussed in detail by other reviewers on this board but everyone seems to have ignored one very obvious gaffe. We all know the classic line &quot;Speak! You have a civil tongue in your head. I know because I sewed it in place myself!&quot; But in that same scene Whit gets a line that should properly have gone to his assistant (Robert Burton). Remember that Whit&apos;s Prof. Frankenstein has lived his entire life in England and he is visiting this country for a relative short time. His remark about the newly revived Creature &quot;He should be chattering like a Senator at a filibuster.&quot; is far too American a statement to come from someone who is just visiting from another country. It is better suited to Robert Burton&apos;s character who is an American. Perhaps if Whit had said &quot;chattering like an MP&quot; (Member of Parliament) instead. Oh well, this is still a fun movie, especially now that the colour ending has been restored.\n\nPoints of interest: Gary Conway&apos;s real name is Gareth Carmody. He changed it himself because he thought it sounded too &quot;highbrow&quot; for an actor. Robert Burton later went on to battle THE SLIME PEOPLE in 1963. And of course many of us remember Phyliss Coates from &quot;Superman&quot; on television but how many remember she appeared in the 1952 film INVASION USA along with Noel Neill? Both Lois Lane&apos;s in one movie! I don&apos;t know what became of the alligator, but he certainly seemed to enjoy his role and he does indeed give a convincing performance."

      "reviewBody": "This entry in the Sherlock Holmes series is one of the best and it sees the great Basil Rathbone reprise his role as the eloquent sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, once again. This film sees the world&apos;s greatest detective face off against his arch nemesis, Professor Moriarty, who plans to not only commit the world&apos;s greatest crime, but do it right under the nose of our protagonist. Like most detective dramas, this one keeps itself alive by offering the audience a constant sense of intrigue and ensuring that we follow the mystery along with Sherlock Holmes. The film also benefits from it&apos;s central character, who is always a delight to have on screen before you. Holmes is brought to life with a confidant and assured persona, and you always get the impression that he knows exactly what he&apos;s doing. His mannerisms are also a treat, and the way that Holmes uses his spare time to do things such as play violin to houseflies, is absurdly funny and helps to build the character into the eccentric and intelligent man that he is.\n\nWhile a few people, such as Peter Cushing for example, have played Sherlock Holmes; it will always be Basil Rathbone that will be best remembered for it. His persona blends exquisitely with that of the central character, and it makes for a great piece of casting. His mannerisms and personality are great throughout, and Basil Rathbone was clearly born for this role. The rest of the casting is good too, with Nigel Bruce in the role of Watson making the best of it, and also cult favourite George Zucco, who brings class and sophistication to the role of Holmes&apos; arch enemy Professor Moriarty. The story itself is strong, and the two mysteries that run through it combine well together and both threads are interesting enough to keep the audience entertained throughout. It&apos;s a shame that films like this aren&apos;t made any more as they make for a great slice of entertainment, as we watch a mystery unravel before our eyes. Still, a lot were made in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s and I plan to track them all down!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ballad of Narayama&quot; is ultimately a film about survival.\n\nSet during the Meiji Period, the inhabitants of a tiny Japanese farming village are forced to embrace extreme tactics to ensure that they stay alive.\n\nMale babies are instantly killed with hardly any remorse, while females are usually sold. Stealing food is punishable by death, which we see in a very disturbing scene where an entire family are buried alive due their father&apos;s crime.\n\nAnd, ultimately, the elderly are sent to die at the base of a mountain called Narayama when they reach the age of 70.\n\nDespite the depressing tone, there is a lot of humor in this film, as well. The songs that the villagers sing about each other are pretty funny, and it&apos;s difficult not to laugh at Old Orin trying to knock her own teeth out with a rock.\n\nSpeaking of Old Orin, the actress who player her (Sumiko Sakamoto) gives a wonderful performance in this film. She had her teeth surgically removed for this role, and gives a realistic depiction of a 70-year-old woman even though she was in her 40s when the film was made.\n\n&quot;Ballad of Narayama&quot; is indeed a depressing film in many aspects, but it&apos;s also filled with humor and offers a better understanding of what life must be like in these types of situations.",

Donovan that is brought still alive to his care. However Donovan dies and Dr. Cory decides to use his brain in his experiment keeping it alive in a tank. Pat, Schratt and Janice research about the life of Donovan and they discover that he was a ruthless and evil man.

Schratt and Janice sees the transformation of Dr. Cory and plan to destroy the brain.

      "reviewBody": "While riding the subway eight years ago, I saw the billboards for &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; and I really didn&apos;t think much about it then. I had yet to become a fan of Blake Edwards&apos; work, and I really hadn&apos;t seen any of the previous Panther films.\n\nFlash forward to 1999. Turner Classic Movies had shown the first six entries in the Panther series and I had watched them in chronological order, which I think is a good idea for anyone to do. I had seen &quot;Curse&quot; on tape and I decided to check out &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; just out of curiosity. I had read some reviews, which were pretty dismal. So I had no reason to expect anything great.\n\nImagine my surprise when I found myself laughing a lot during the 95 minute running time of &quot;Son&quot;. This was a clever, funny and very original entry in the long-running &quot;Panther&quot; series. Blake Edwards&apos; instinct was right on the money when he cast Italian comedian Roberto Benigni in the role of Clouseau&apos;s illegitimate son. Benigni displays all the traits that made Peter Sellers such a great talent. He plays the comic scenes very straight which sells it so much better than if he had played it slyly. And the films he has made since (&quot;The Monster&quot;, &quot;Night on Earth&quot; and &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;, which was sort of his own &quot;Being There&quot;) just confirms my initial reaction. And of course, what is a Panther film without Dreyfus, played as always by Herbert Lom, who works well with Benigni in many memorable sequences.\n\nIf I have a complaint about &quot;Son&quot;, it is that it tends to get too preoccupied with the plot. The best Panther films didn&apos;t depend on plot as much as characterization and &quot;Son&quot; suffers because of it as did Edwards&apos; previous disappointment &quot;Switch&quot;. But &quot;Son&quot; has a manic comic energy and polish that &quot;Switch&quot; lacked and the payoffs work as in &quot;Switch&quot; they did not.\n\n&quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; is a better film than &quot;Curse&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot; and the original film, but not &quot;Strikes Again&quot;, &quot;Return&quot; and &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (of which this film has its roots in) Sadly, Edwards retired from theatrical features after this although he still works in TV. He showed so much vigor and life in &quot;Son&quot; that makes me want to see him make another Panther film, especially with Roberto Benigni. I&apos;m still waiting.\n\n***1/2 out of 4 stars"

      "reviewBody": "The mystique of violin making has always intrigued me so this film was a big attraction for me going in, and I wasn&apos;t disappointed for one second!\n\nOK, first of all, the obvious things that make it special: reality, craft, acting, scoring, and cinematography! It takes only a few seconds to know that this gem did NOT emanate from the money grubbers in Hokeywood California as one more way to titillate teenagers with sex, violence, and computer generated special effects with a subliminal message that sells products. Nope! This film was made by film makers who understand the power of a story well told, and REAL cinema.\n\nCutting back and forth repeatedly between the present and various disparate periods and places from the past, THE RED VIOLIN forces the viewer to pay attention and most of all... THINK!\n\nThe Red Violin is NOT the subject here but a catalyst to stimulate thought about human behavior and how different societies have related to art as we move through the centuries.\n\nThe casting was (on the whole) excellent though the choice of Samuel L. Jackson as a learned expert in ancient instruments was not convincing for me personally. And, the NON-ending which is more of a comment on human habits of acquisition than human nobility, was just not what I considered a definitive ending. (Maybe that was the point! &quot;Everything continues endlessly...&quot;)\n\nIf you go to movies as an excuse to nibble away on munchies and get titillation, well, this one&apos;s NOT for you. BUT, if you have the patience to watch and think simultaneously as a great story unfolds, then SEE this film immediately!"

During some of the most intense moments, and during the plot twists, and some of the most important elements of the story; one of which COULD BE HEARD over the background music. This is supposed to be taking place in snow covered tundra. The background music completely overtook the &quot;wind machines,&quot; and most importantly the dialogue. The actors and production crew should have gotten paid double for having to endure all of that cold, only to have the film, and their dialogue completely drowned out by background music, that was clearly added by some jack hat in a warm editing studio somewhere. I give this movie two stars for its production value.",

They use sex, or shock, or sex to sell two hours of something that in no way contributes to our existence; be it inspiration, knowledge or spiritual awakening.\n\nContact is an exceptional example of a movie that DESERVES to exist. From the spectactular beginning shot that shows us just how small we are in a world that once thought the universe was made for, and around, mankind; to its realistic conclusion that any X-Phile would expect to happen: this movie appeals to our humanity, intelligence and sense of adventure.\n\nOne of the greatest realisations that the movie will guide you to is that what we search for in outer space is actually in our own backyards. We are cut off from each other and sci-fi tries to quell our loneliness with ideas that we&apos;ll meet E.T. and wont feel so lonely in our existence. But were AREN&apos;T alone... we have each other.\n\nI never get tired of watching this movie, though I wish they brought out a packed special edition DVD full of behind the scene effects and the like.",

      "reviewBody": "In May of 1991 the world was just not ready for Hudson Hawk, and apparently this caused a lot of confusion in the marketing department. How on Earth were they supposed to sell this strange oddity of a film? Eventually they settled on Bruce Willis brand recognition and built an ad campaign that would promote it as a sort of Die Hard-lite. When audiences eventually found out it was an absurdist, cartoon caper comedy they didn&apos;t quite know what to make of it and it was widely panned by critics and filmgoers alike. Not fair. Hudson Hawk is actually a wonderful little movie with a reputation is simply doesn&apos;t deserve.\n\nBy the time July of 1991 rolled around the movie was getting its UK premier and the ad campaign had changed to play up the comedy and adventure more than the action. I remember 10-year-old me (already a Die Hard and Willis fan) sitting alone in a screen at the old UCI cinema in Kinnaird Park thinking &quot;this looks awesome&quot;. If a kid could tell the difference...\n\nBeing a 15-rating here in the UK (and rated R in the US) I had to wait until it hit home video. As soon as the end credits rolled I was fascinated by this new Cappuccino thing that Hawk was always harping on about. It became my go-to beverage whenever and wherever it was being served (an idiosyncrasy that has since been ruined by the horrific advent of &quot;fashionable coffee&quot;). As you can tell, I&apos;ve been a fan of Hudson Hawk since I was a kid.\n\nBruce Willis is Eddie Hawkins, the world&apos;s greatest cat-burglar, who is determined to go straight after a long stretch in prison. Too bad for him that an assortment of eccentric villains are determined to force him to do their dirty work in a crazy world domination plot. Take the usual tropes of James Bond, Crosby and Hope, the Pink Panther, and retro heist movies and you&apos;ll have something close to what Hudson Hawk attempts to be. It is handsomely shot in real European locations with lots of quotable dialogue courtesy of Daniel Waters who co-wrote the script with Die Hard scribe Steven E. De Souza, based on Willis&apos; original ideas. Yes, Bruce Willis created Hudson Hawk himself.\n\nThe movie is far from perfect though, even the biggest Hudson Hawk fans know that. It is way too complicated and will take several viewings just to fully grasp what the hell is going on. However, even in 1991 it seemed that De Souza and Waters knew that the European Union and forthcoming &quot;single currency market&quot; would be a terrible idea. The plot to ruin the world economy would probably be lauded in these more politically turbulent times.\n\nAlso,the literal bookends are an indulgence too far, and Andie McDowell (a last minute replacement for Isabella Rossellini and Maruschka Detmers) is just about tolerable in a role that she clearly didn&apos;t understand. The scene where she feigns mental illness by speaking in Dolphin-ish is yet another eccentricity that the film could have done without. But the main fault here is the swearing. The cast are dropping f-bombs and mofos all over the place and it just doesn&apos;t sit well the overall tone. There is absolutely no reason why Hudson Hawk should have been anything more than a PG. When I was 10-years-old I was overdosing on episodes of The Young Ones (a similarly anarchic and crazy TV show) and this movie really appealed to me. I do believe that kids and family audiences were the people that Hudson Hawk should have been sold to and the R-rating harmed the films appeal a lot.\n\nMcDowell aside, the cast are all either wonderfully over-the-top or strangely quirky. From James Coburn&apos;s enthusiastic CIA crook, to a restrained David Caruso as the mute Kit Kat. He doesn&apos;t even have any lines and he has a character arc. If you are in need of light- hearted, good-natured entertainment then Hudson Hawk never fails. It is a real shame that this never had the chance to develop into a franchise. If so we might have been spared the awfulness of Die Hard 4 and 5.",

It probably became too much of a toll for her, but she labored on because she still wanted to act and my guess is she needed the money for her mounting medical bills. Then, there were creative differences over the script and how the project was being filmed. So she walked off.\n\nWICKED STEPMOTHER had a rather small budget of $2.5 million. But it only made $43,000 at the box office. So by all accounts, it was a huge bomb and not the type of movie swan song befitting a legend of Davis&apos; magnitude."

      "reviewBody": "The appealing Sandy Brooke plays Taura, an Amazonian miner who is targeted by a bad guy named Bantor (Ross Hagen), a sadistic government agent. She is sentenced by a judge (John Carradine, in a VERY quick cameo) to prison time on a spaceship, the &quot;Star Slammer&quot; of the title. She earns the respect of fellow inmates such as &quot;Mike&quot; (Suzy Stokey), and gets on the bad side of the kinky warden (Marya Gant) and her eyepatch wearing henchwoman &quot;Muffin&quot; (Dawn Wildsmith).\n\nThere&apos;s definitely something to be said for movies by the likes of Fred Olen Ray, the director here. There&apos;s a complete lack of pretension, as Ray seeks to do no more than entertain the viewers, albeit in a low budget, cheesy way. He&apos;s essentially doing a W.I.P. (Women In Prison) exploitation feature, transposed to a science-fiction environment. There&apos;s unfortunately no shower scene, but there are the expected catfights, and the attractive female cast shows some of the goods while dressed in stylized, skimpy costumes. The gore and creature effects are wonderfully tacky; be on the lookout for a cameo by the monster in &quot;The Deadly Spawn&quot;. Sets, special effects and music all do a suitable job of maintaining interest for a cult-movie loving crowd. Also look for a quick shot from John Carpenters&apos; &quot;Dark Star&quot; and space battle footage bodily lifted from &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot;.\n\nStokey (who does her own harmonica playing at one point) and Brooke are engaging heroines, while Hagen, Gant, and Wildsmith all relish the chance to tear into the scenery. Aldo Ray is kind of wasted as a mutated sadist dubbed The Inquisitor, but at least he gets more screen time than Carradine. Screenwriter Michael Sonye (a.k.a. Dukey Flyswatter) also plays the supporting role of Bantors&apos; flunky Krago. Johnny Legend gives a positively goofy performance as the wandering priest Zaal. Director Ray and Jack H. Harris, who produced the picture with him, have voice-only cameos.\n\nWhile not one of Rays&apos; best, &quot;Star Slammer&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Adventures of Taura: Prison Ship Star Slammer&quot;) shows fans of schlock a good time.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

This movie is not like any other Korean film that I have watched, but it is a lot like the Japanese classic &quot;Ping Pong&quot; and it is a lot like American coming of age films such as &quot;The Freshman&quot;, &quot;Breaking Away&quot; and &quot;The Graduate&quot; and the Australian movies &quot;Muriel&apos;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, i.e. there are plenty of belly laughs, a few tearful moments and a sense that what you are watching is universal.\n\nAnyone who watches this looking for another &quot;Shamo&quot; (I love Shamo, btw) or similar martial arts film will be disappointed. While it starts on a downer note, it ends on a spiritual/emotional/intellectual high. I can not praise it highly enough. I makes me feel good inside knowing that it was a commercial hit in Korea---means there are a lot of good hearted people in Korea. I am definitely going to look for more films by the writer/director.",

      "reviewBody": "What makes up who we are? Are we the result of our past experiences and memories or does our identity stem from something much deeper? These are questions that the 2012 remake of the classic action film &quot;Total Recall&quot; could have delved into. What we have instead is a showcase of the best and worst of modern science fiction film making. It is Definitely a product of 2012 as much as the original was a product of the early 90s.\n\nThe aforementioned themes are only teased but never developed in this intense tale of on man&apos;s quest to uncover the truth of his identity and past. In a vastly overcrowded, class segregated future, everyman Douglas Quaid is haunted by dreams of being a secret agent on the run. Convinced that these are repressed fantasies brought on by his monotonous life assembling security automatons (which are like Cyber Stormtroopers) Quaid visits this place called &quot;Rekall&quot;; Rekall claims to implant fake but realistic fantasies into one&apos;s mind. So he gets a fantasy of being a double agent implanted. Suddenly, its discovered that he already has memories of being an agent: meaning he actually is an agent with his memory erased. A swat team busts in for some reason and he dispatches them to some beautiful camera camera pans. What follows is &quot;Kurt Wimmer&apos;s &apos;Salt: dystopian future edition - minus Angelina Jolie&quot; (surprise surprise, this movie is also written by Wimmer) with Quaid&apos;s wife turning out to be a psychopathic killer, his past a complete sham and his grip on that fine line between reality and fantasy slowly slipping. In the background lies a dastardly plot by a rich chancellor involving the poor dissidents of the overcrowded Colony and the leader of an underground resistance.\n\nThe most striking feature of Total Recall would be the stunning vision of this overcrowded future. Floating buildings to make up for scarce land, a country confused by its melting pot of cultures, cyborg police, hover cars, it is amazing. This is a future that seems very real judging from our current world: Strict class segregation taken to the extreme. The dichotomy in the design between the rich and elite United Federation of Britain and The ramshackle Colony is beautifully rendered thanks to the amazing production design headed by Patrick Tatopoulos (the guy who worked on Independence Day, Starship Troopers and Dark city).\n\nA pity that the rest of the movie is fairly typical of modern day chase thrillers. Compared to the original Total Recall film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, this remake has Less twists, a less ambiguous ending and lacks the cynical dark humor that made the original so memorable. Instead of keeping it ambiguous as to whether the events unfolding are real or part of Quaid&apos;s implanted fantasy, this remake spoils its own mystery for the audience.\n\nDirector Len Wiseman brings in all that is good and bad in modern day film making into this movie. He shoots Total Recall with an over reliance on shaky cam and lens flare, almost like a &quot;Paul Greengrass meets J.J Abrams&quot;. Think Bourne Supremacy with the visual style of the 2009 Star Trek film. The future is epilepsy inducing, we get it; and sometimes this really distracts from the tip top designs.\n\nThe cast is basically a reunion of mist actors that were in Len Wiseman&apos;s Underworld franchise. They do an excellent job with the acting and chemistry but the good actors like Bill Nighly felt under utilised. Only Kate Beckinsale was able to truly shine playing Quaid&apos;s wife-turned-assassin. Quaid himself is played by Colin Ferrel and is perhaps the only improvement this remake boasts over the original. Schwarzenegger&apos;s Quaid was the quintessential action hero but Ferrel&apos;s portrayal of the character had a greater sense of peril: he looks nothing like an action hero and this makes his transformation from everyman to savior of the downtrodden all the more powerful.\n\nWhether one finds this a good movie or not depends on whether one can accept the modern trends of science fiction film making. It is the same plot as the original with all the &quot;1990s&quot; elements taken out and replaced with &quot;2012&quot; elements. Art Aficionados will be impressed by the overall look, style and camera-work showcased here. Those looking for a deep meaningful dive into the nature of human identity or even those looking for clever twists or smart dialogue will be let down. Take away the visuals and it&apos;s a rather generic, straight forward modern chase thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "Ursula Andress ordering the execution of chained natives whilst wearing what looks like a bird costume; Peter Cushing and Bernard Cribbins cutting the rug with a couple of belly-dancers; Chris Lee wearing a stupid hat: &apos;She&apos; might not be the greatest Hammer film of all time, but it certainly has its fair share of moments that make it worthwhile!\n\nBased on the H. Rider Haggard adventure of the same name, this 1965 offering from the &apos;studio that dripped blood&apos; sees a trio of adventurersHolly (Cushing), Leo (John Richardson) and Job (Cribbins)seeking the fabled city of Kuma, after they come into possession of a map that reveals its location. After risking their lives travelling through a desert, they arrive at their destination where they meet Ayesha, the immortal queen of the city, who reveals to Leo that he is the reincarnation of her dead lover Callicrates. Now, after 2000 years of waiting, Ayesha will do anything to keep him by her side for the rest of eternity.\n\nDirected by Robert Day (who had previously helmed a couple of Tarzan movies and therefore would seem like an obvious choice for this adventure set in the &apos;dark continent&apos;), &apos;She&apos; is a lavish production that, whilst it might never be labelled a classic, has enough spectacle to make it worth a go.\n\nAs always, Cushing and Lee give solid performances, and Cribbins is likable as reluctant adventurer Job; Andress and Richardson are rather wooden, but are easy on the eye. Also rather lovely is Rosenda Monteros, as Ustane, a native girl who almost succeeds in luring Leo away from the manipulative Ayesha.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of Hammer films in general, and are partial to a bit of exotic adventure set in far flung lands, then &apos;She&apos; should fit the bill rather nicely.\n\n6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",

Romero as Archbishop of San Salvador has to balance the factions inside the church. The National Guard massacres dozens of worshippers. Grande is killed by death squads. Romero tries to free Rafael Zelada from the guerrillas. Atrocities continue as he struggles to find a way.\n\nThis is an important biopic of a compelling historical figure. Raul Julia is pulling back to play a calming presence in uncertain times. He does have some power acting moments. His performance is mostly one-note and that keeps tension from rising. Maybe an energized inner monologue could heighten the tension.",

      "reviewBody": "Clayde Lanznan&apos;s &quot;The Karski Report&quot; turned out to be the single most compelling film experience of the entire Berlin 2013 festival week. I had read quite a bit about Karski and been fascinated by his incredible story, but had always wondered what it would be like to meet him in person – and there he was up on the screen larger than life. Jan Karski, a courier for the AK, the Underground Polish Army under German occupation, and a non- Jewish Polish observer of Nazi bestiality in Poland, was one of the unsung heroes of WW II -- unsung largely because his heroism fell on deaf ears when he emerged in England and the US to tell his story. Lanzmann conducted two days of interviews with Karski at his home in Washington DC in 1985, but only the first part was shown earlier in SHOAH. \n\nThe fascinating second day, reedited in 2010, is the substance of this amazing film interview. What is amazing, of course, is the fact that Karski witnessed the ongoing atrocities with his own eyes, but nobody outside of Poland wanted to believe him, or thought his report on German brutality was so exaggerated that it was beyond belief and must be a fabrication. In the film we see Karski close-up, now a lean middle aged professor of political science with silver hair, pale blue eyes, and wearing a natty silver suit, seated in an armchair in his book lined study, as he reflects upon each question posed to him by Lanzmann, then answers fully in carefully considered detail. The most chilling part of the interview is the account of his meeting with FDR, president Roosevelt, for a half hour at the White House. He has been carefully coached by the Polish ambassador as to protocol and is told to be concise, unemotional, and to the point. Karski knows that the president is a cripple behind his desk, but he also sees him as a man who is totally aware of his gigantic influence as a shaper of world events, one of the most powerful men in the world – and one who expresses himself only in all-encompassing global terms.\n\nKarski opens with a description of what he saw in Warsaw and Belzic, but the president takes little note of it, only seeing it as a small part of a much larger problem. Roosevelt goes on and on about the need to defeat the Nazis and liberate Poland, but never makes any further reference to the mass murder of the Jews that Karski has mentioned. The next day Karski is introduced to Supreme court justice Felix Frankfurter, himself Jewish and one of Roosevelt&apos;s closest confidants. Frankfurter&apos;s reaction to Karski&apos;s story is that he &quot;cannot believe it&quot; – talk about stomach churning Holocaust denial at the highest levels imaginable – and here from a Jewish man who was in a position to actually do something about it – but chose not to – in the name of &quot;higher considerations!\n\nThe thing that makes this straightforward interview film so gripping is the steely unshakable presence of the man Jan Karski himself – reconstructing before our eyes moments of amazing intimate confrontation with the highest powers in the world and his absolutely cold recitation of the facts –nothing but the facts, as Sergeant Friday might put it  I left that screening with my head spinning and had a brief chat with a young German student who burst into tears as she acknowledged that her own grandfather might well have been one of the concentration camp killers. Claude Lanzmann, a French survivor of the WW II underground resistance, not of a concentration camp – has done more than make documentary films – he has literally made history by devoting a lifetime to making absolutely sure that this is all recorded for posterity. Had I only seen this one film my Berlinale 2013 would have been complete.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a tale about the lows of a group of high school kids that turn to crime and cyberspace obsession of a pop singer named Lily Chou-Chou.\n\nWriter/director Shunji Iwai film is complex, dark and depressing, with a real intense feel of teenage angst, but truly it&apos;s a beautiful film to watch. Shunji Iwai gives us disturbing images of youth&apos;s harrowing experiences, in which some characters you feel for, but then after a while you might suddenly despise or the opposite.\n\nWith visually stunning and fresh cinematography, it felt like I was watching an arty music video clip at times. The scenery in the film is lush and exquisite, from the contrast of the alluring islands and the rich grass fields to the harshness of the city and school.\n\nA distinguished and unique soundtrack surrounds and overwhelms the film; the songs we hear are those from the fictional pop singer Lily Chou-Chou. The music really added to the beauty and mystique of this film.\n\nHayato Ichihara as Yûichi Hasumi, a troubled kid that is involve in a crime gang and under an alias, runs the fan club website about Lily Chou-Chou, Shûgo Oshinari as Shusuke Hoshino, once a top student and then suddenly changes and becomes a gang leader and Ayumi Ito as the quiet Yôko Kuno, an outstanding piano player but because of that she is bullied. The performances are brilliantly absorbing and there are no hiccups to say off.\n\nSince the Lily Chou-Chou Website is an important part of the film, we don&apos;t actually see anyone in front of the computer screen, except for Yuichi. Whenever there were conversations on her fan&apos;s Website, the user-name and their comment would pop up on the screen throughout different scenes in the film or on a black background, though some of the conversations have no resemblance to what&apos;s actually happening on screen. At first some of the people were hard to work out who was who on the net, but still I found it quite intriguing.\n\nThe time line in the story goes from the present to past and back to the present, where we learn in detail about Yuichi and Shusuke. There are a couple of surprises that you don&apos;t see coming and the story might have its flaws- but they didn&apos;t seem to bother me, as I was simply engrossed with the dense context of the film.\n\nLike I typed before this is an haunting and intense tale about teenage angst, there is a lot of agonizing imagery and confronting situations like violence, depression, rape, suicide, prostitution and bullying. This gives it such a grim and disturbing undertone, so it might alienate certain viewers. \n\nFor me it was a breath-taking and visually satisfying experience. \n\n5/5",

Happily, I was not disappointed. This is, without doubt, Moore&apos;s finest acting role and he delights with his use of facial expression; to me it shows that there is a lot more to his acting skills than the rather one-dimensional parts he spent most of his career playing e.g. The Saint, Brett Sinclair and Bond. Of course, this is dated, as it was filmed in 1970, however most people - myself included - have a fond affection for this period. Good support from some stalwart actors, including Anton Rogers and Hildegard Neil make this a satisfying experience. In my opinion, this story would merit a re-make by a director such as Christopher Nolan.\n\nNB One of the spookiest things about this film is that the director - Basil Dearden - was tragically killed in a car accident shortly after it was completed, in the exact stretch of road used in the film. This only serves to add to the mystery of this film but may put any superstitious directors off attempting a re-make. My recommendation is to watch this late at night with the lights off... Enjoy!",

It is an unusual love story which looks more like an adventure. This film will teach you how to buy a ticket in the bus, how to &apos;get cash&apos; and how to do shopping.

But....who says the imagination has to florish on common every day stuff.  I thought it was really funny and compared the flik to Attack of the 50 foot woman.  It also borrowed some orchestration chords from my all time favorite child hood monster flik WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS. Every once in a while we all feel the need to see something cheezy and not common. This movie is that type of movie.  We know it is not real and just a dream, but why knock it? I wish it would come to DVD. I am a collector of Cheezy horror movies from the 50&apos;s, 60&apos;s and other eras. Die hard Gozilla fans will get a kick out of this movie.  I personally thought War of the Gargantuas really represented what a real hideous beast should look like. If the Studios in Japan ever read this comment, please put War of the Gargantuas on DVD!!!!"

I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn&apos;t get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched.",

Released in 2008 the movie offers a good insight of the society of this area of Germany, which explains why AFD is gaining so much support in the former East Germany regions.

We were studying third world cinema and were supposed to see the Frida Kahlo film by Paul LeDuc, but instead got this little documentary.  The biography of Frida along with the interpretations of many of her paintings were so unique that later that day I went and bought a picture plaque of one of her later paintings.  Her tragic story was inspiring and the director and narrator did a very thorough job of retelling her life, along with the trouble she encountered with her famous painter husband Diego Rivera. Highly recommended to anyone interested in artists and the things that inspire them.  I may even check out the new Salma Hayek movie about Frida Kahlo.",

      "reviewBody": "I kind of wish I didn&apos;t know before watching Why Does Herr R Run Amok? that there was the distinct possibility- pointed by a quote on IMDb&apos;s trivia by co-star Hanna Schygulla- that Rainer Werner Fassbinder may have had *nothing* to do with with this film, considered by some to be one of his best. It made me think, from time to time watching, it, if maybe this point was correct, considering a) Fassbinder usually doesn&apos;t do improvisation, as it would appear this film does to the point where one wonders if a script was even used (was this, in fact, one of the first &quot;mumblecore&quot; movies?) and b) why his usual cast agreed to do it if it was only run by Michael Fengler (who, in his defense, also collaborated on The Niklashausen Journey and may be a capable producer in his own right).\n\nBecause, frankly, this isn&apos;t like the Fassbinder you would be used to after seeing, for example, the BDR trilogy or Fear Eats the Soul. It&apos;s as if Fassbinder and/or Fengler contracted Al Maysles to follow an &apos;average&apos; middle-class German family, the father and architect and the wife a, uh, house-wife I guess, with an &apos;average&apos; child. The style of dialog is improvisation, and the camera-work reflects this with the &quot;cienema verite&quot; approach. Indeed there may be only about 30 actual shots in the whole film; it&apos;s a series of long takes as the DP, Dietrich Lohmann, goes around a room and zooms in or out based on a feeling here or there or something that may be of interest (such as the desperation Herr R tries his best to hide in most scenes).\n\nWhat happens with this style, for better or worse, is that we get into the daily grind, the mundane conversations in a living room or in a car (i.e. car repairs), a trip to the school for a talk with the teacher about the kid, or a trip to the not-totally sympathetic doctor, or the embarrassing toast that Herr R makes in front of his co-workers and boss. There is the mundane, and its so much that one starts to get into this mood. There is a drawback if one isn&apos;t ready/willing/able to be in this style; not a lot &quot;happens&quot; in the film until, of course, the frighteningly sudden climax of the &quot;Amok&quot; part of the title. Indeed there&apos;s something to this that draws in the audience with the characters; there&apos;s a scene where Herr R, his wife, their son and a couple of friends are walking along on a road, and it goes on for so long (both the shot and the slow walk) we, as well as the parents, don&apos;t realize that the son has gone off on his own and don&apos;t know where he ventured off.\n\nHerr R. is an emotional story, but it&apos;s a little hard to penetrate. But for those who are patient and attentive there are some great rewards. One of these is Kurt Raab&apos;s performance (who, by the way, is also called Mr. Raab in the film, which adds to the confusion of whether this is documentary or fiction, or both at the same time); it&apos;s a performance that is tricky but works very well, full of subtlety and restraint, eyes darting carefully and physical expressions to the dot meant with importance. The performance is improvised, but there&apos;s nothing I can see that wasn&apos;t thought through to be on the screen by Fassbinder and/or Fengler. And it&apos;s this character, if nothing else, that marks it as the indicator of it being from RW; it&apos;s about the alienation of an outsider, someone in such a mundane world, so &quot;normal&quot; that there is barely any expression of individuality, of anything outside of a &quot;norm&quot; being seen as anything except quiet (or not so quiet) scorn. This is set up from the start with the characters telling the jokes, and Herr R&apos;s going flat with everyone else.\n\nIt&apos;s basically a super-low budget experiment in reality-as-drama, about the emptiness of a class system that allows people to live comfortably and with some semblance of peace, but also a form of life that can be shattered so easily and with such terror. The ending, indeed, can only be really comparable to the likes of Haneke&apos;s Cache for its random, existential impact. The more one lets Herr R in, the more this world is horrible and cruel and desperate. Not the brightest of times to have, but worthwhile all the same.",

      "name": "Very mediocre horror movie regularly directed by Juán Piquer with chills , scary scenes and supernatural events",
      "reviewBody": "Below average juvenile horror that claims to be based on H. P. Lovecrft stories. La mansión de los Cthulhu (1992) deals with group of drug dealing petty criminals (Luis Fernando Alvés , Brad Fisher , Melanie Shatner , Kaethe Cherney) fleeing from the cops and along the way they kidnap an aging magician (Frank Finlay) harboring an amazing occult secret and his daughter (Marcia Layton) . As they are taken as hostages in their isolated mansion by some villain scumbags . The oldest-looking juvenile delinquents you&apos;ve ever seen release evil spirits when they take over the magician&apos;s state . When the captors refuse to listen to the magician&apos;s horrible warning to release him unharmed , the mansion slowly releases its nightmare of horrors on the unsuspecting invaders. Beyond evil . Beyond Terror. Beyond the gates of Hell. The final resting place. The evil is free.\n\nThis is a humdrum adaptation with abominable dialogue , being inspired by H. P. Lovecraft stories from a screenplay and lousy filmmaking by the Spanish craftsman Juan Piquer Simón . As the plot lifts some scenes from other films , concerning a gang who abducts a magician and his daughter , taking as hostages at their home ; but once the delinquents reach the mansion , all hell breaks loose , being shown with no very special effects and that&apos;s a load of dung . The script by Juán Piquer himself contains restless terror and great loads of gore , blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the usual ghastly shenanigans that result to be weird creature appearances , cracking objects throwing fire , furniture flying , a number of knifes slashing a person , wall ooze , plants manifest as attackers , doors suddenly slamming and anything else . It is produced in medium/short budget by José Gutiérrez Maesso who long time ago wrote and produced a number of Spaghetti Westerns . The FX and make-up experts : Basilio Cortijo , Emilio Ruiz del Rio and Colin Arthur recreated the eerie story with low-grade and traditional special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . It&apos;s actually halfway-low terror movie that achieved little success at the box office , though it will appeal to hardcore horror aficionados , that&apos;s why it packs absurd situations and cheesy but amusing frames . Although critics do not appreciate much this picture ; however has a kind of loopy , Ed Wood quality that must be endured to be totally considered . The fable is sometimes silly and laughable , though a few naif effects and action are professionally made . Some illogical parts in plot are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the horrifing scenes .\n\nThe motion picture was middlingly directed by Juan Piquer Simón . Juan , who goes by &quot;J. P. Simon&quot; on foreign releases , began in films as a writer and assistant director and continued his career by making short films and documentaries . Juan produced and directed &quot;exploitation&quot; pictures for two decades running . He often used numerous &quot;older technique&quot; FX such as transparency , matte paintings , rubber-suited enemies , reverse-footage to create certain images ; all of them were made by Emilio Ruiz Del Rio , Francisco Prosper , Colin Arthur and Juan Piquer himself . He was one of the main directors of the Spanish horror boom in the 70s and 80s specially for his quartet of horror films as ¨Escalofrio¨, ¨Slugs¨ , ¨Supersonic Man¨. ¨Cthulhu Mansion¨ and his greatest success and immensely popular ¨Pieces¨ , all of them being recreated by means of traditional effects . Juan owned his own studio and created and/or designed many of the simple and primitive special effects sequences you see in any of his many imaginative undertakings . Piquer , who passed away at 2011 , was a good artisan who realized a lot of fun as well as entertaining films . Juan Piquer who was director of the Mostra of Valencia (Spain) , displayed along professional career and specialized on all kind of genres as Terror , Sci-fi (The rift , The new Extraterrestres, Supersonic man) and made some adaptations about Jules Verne novels (&quot;Fabulous Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; , &quot;Mystery on Monster Island&quot;) . While his films have been universally panned by the prestigious reviewer s, they have a kind of quality that must be endured to be utterly appreciated . Rating : 4.5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "While I love horror films, I am not a big fan of the slasher genre, which has come to dominate and indeed practically to define horror since the late 1970s. While I do love the original &quot;Psycho,&quot; most slasher films follow a different, and far more predictable, formula. The idea of a faceless killer going around stabbing teenagers just doesn&apos;t frighten me a whole lot, though some of these films do fill me with disgust--a rather different sort of emotion.\n\nI am far more frightened by films that deal with distortions of reality, where it&apos;s hard for the characters to tell what&apos;s real and what&apos;s not. Admittedly, that genre isn&apos;t always so lofty either. Dreams are one of the most overused devices in the movies, having a whole set of clichés associated with them. We are all familiar with the common scene in which a character awakens from a nightmare by jerking awake in cold sweat. This convention is not only overused, it&apos;s blatantly unrealistic, for people waking up from dreams do not jerk awake in such a violent fashion. Moreover, these scenes are usually nothing more than little throwaway sequences designed to amuse or frighten the audience without advancing the plot.\n\nWhat makes &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; so clever is how it creates an entirely new convention for representing dreams on screen. The dreaming scenes are filmed with an airy, murky quality, but so are many of the waking scenes, making it very difficult to tell whether a character is awake or asleep. Indeed, the movie never shows any character actually fall asleep, and as a result we are constantly on guard whenever characters so much as close their eyes for a moment. In crucial scenes, it is impossible to tell whether what we are seeing is real or happening only in a character&apos;s mind. But the movie ultimately suggests that the difference doesn&apos;t matter. The premise of the movie, in which a child-killer haunts teenager&apos;s dreams and has the capability of killing them while they&apos;re asleep, turns the whole &quot;It was all just a dream&quot; convention on its head: in this movie, the real world is safe, and the dream world is monstrously dangerous.\n\nThe movie finds a number of ways to explore this ambiguity, including a bathtub scene that invites comparisons with the shower scene in &quot;Psycho&quot; without being a cheap ripoff. My personal favorite scene, and one of the scariest I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie, is the one where Nancy dozes off in the classroom while a student is standing up in front of the class reading a passage from Shakespeare. The way the scene transitions from the real classroom to a nightmarish version of it is brilliantly subtle.\n\nThe director, Wes Craven, understood that the anticipation of danger is usually more frightening than the final attack. There are some great visual shots to that effect, including one where Freddy&apos;s arms becomes unnaturally long in an alleyway, and another where the stairs literally turn into a gooey substance, in imitation of the common nightmare where it is hard to get away from a pursuer. The movie continually finds creative ways to tease the audience, never resorting to red herring, that tired old convention used in almost all other slasher films.\n\nDespite the creativity in these scenes, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is still a formula movie, with relatively one-dimensional characters and no great performances. This was Johnny Depp&apos;s first role, as Heather Langenkamp&apos;s boyfriend, and although he does get a few neat lines of exposition (his speech about &quot;dream skills&quot;), his personality is not fleshed out, and there is no sense of the great actor Depp would go on to become.\n\nWithin the genre, however, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is a fine work. My main criticism isn&apos;t its failure to transcend the formula, but its confusing and obtuse ending, apparently put there in anticipation of sequels, but managing to create a mystery that the sequels were unable to clear up. The climactic confrontation between Freddy and Nancy is weakly handled. The crucial words she says to him are surprisingly clunky, and her father&apos;s muted behavior during that scene is almost inexplicable. It has led me to consider an alternative interpretation of the scene, but one that feels like a cop-out. The scene that follows, and where the movie ends, is anticlimactic and unnecessary. These clumsily-made final two scenes come close to ruining the movie, and it is a testament to the film&apos;s many good qualities that it still stands as an unusually effective horror film that invites repeat viewings.",

      "reviewBody": "Broderick Crawford is a slimy politician in a toga and Mark Forest (bodybuilder Lou Degni) is muscleman Goliath in this kitsch epic from Italy, exploited to the max in the U.S. by American International pictures during the drive-in heydays of the late 50&apos;s and early 60&apos;s. This one&apos;s quite a potboiler, with a various assortment of cheesy monster creations (including some very brief stop-motion footage by Jim Danforth), the usual buxom babes with big Roman hairdos and, of course, the solid and stiff muscleman hero performing various feats of strength (like wrestling a bear suit and, rather impressively, genuinely warding off a real elephant!).  It&apos;s all a lot of nostalgic fun and the new DVD release is a revelation in quality, bringing back the bright color and widescreen TotalScope ratio of the original theatrical presentation.  The DVD is also packed with campy tributes to the whole muscleman, sword-and-sandal genre, including a gallery of trailers, shorts and even an entire second strongman feature, the truly ridiculous CONQUERER OF ATLANTIS!  Get ready for a great late-night schlockfest with this package!"
