It in no way ties to the places you are directed to visit and if you are looking for meaningful places around Seattle this is not it.  Ex.  We stopped after we were directed to an out of the way, nothing special coffee shop and then told to go to a bank.  Waste of money."

I ended up driving 45 minutes to another spot. James the driver spoke Chinese and talked in the car only in Chinese. Didn’t explain anything in English. Left us at Mt. Ranier for 90 minutes w no view and nothing open. Did the same at Olympic Mtns but thank God it was a sunny day. Had us pay cash for park entrances but then paid w a business credit card. Seemed fishy because he charged us $45 and I think the park is $35 to get in. A lot of driving and no hiking to speak of. It was mostly people from Hong\nKong and Singapore and me the token American one day and the other day there was three of us. The hotel manager told me every American on the tour always complains how bad it is. A lot of false advertising.stopped at Safeway’s to buy lunch each day."

I booked this activity so that I could see Snoqualmie Falls and have the opportunity to do some hiking at the same time. My tour guide was punctual, friendly and fun to visit with while we hiked. The freshly baked muffins in the morning were an unexpected treat. The hike was fun, Snoqualmie Falls was beautiful and even the drive was scenic and enjoyable. I definitely recommend."

We will visit Capitol Hill to see some of Seattle’s beautiful old Victorian-style homes, independent funky shops, art, and our most beloved bookstore in the Pike/Pine corridor. On our way to Queen Anne we'll pass Seattle Center (home of the Space Needle and MoPOP) before heading to Kerry Park for incredible views. Then we're off to Fremont for lots of public art and charm. We'll finish at Gas Works Park for stunning views, historic preservation and a glimpse into the floating home communities. There are spectacular views all through this drive! If you’re a new resident of Seattle, or considering moving here, this is a great tour for you to start building a mental map of the city, guided by a resident of 30 years. With a max of 4 people in my SUV, this is a fun, personalized way to explore Seattle!",

Highlights include a fancy chocolate shop in a refurbished brewery, the Seattle conservatory and an introduction to Vietnamese cuisine. If you want something different from the regular old tours this is the one for you. The next time we come back to the city we are definitely going to see Lynn again.

It's a time machine! After we explore Georgetown, we will visit Alki Beach, a local favorite with great people watching, stunning views of Elliott Bay, Bainbridge Island and the Olympic Mountains. We may even spot a sea lion, a harbor porpoise, an eagle or an Orca on Alki, you never know. These are the places I take my friends and family when they visit, I'd like to share them with you.\n\nWith a max of 4 people, this is a very personal \"best of Seattle\" tour that explores the places most visitors never see. Come explore with a 30 year local!",

Let’s cruise the scenic shores of Lake Washington and learn the incredible history of how it was “re-plumbed” while on our way to Seward Park where we will have fantastic views of Mt. Rainier (if the mountain is out!). This park is an incredible gem holding one of only 2 old growth stands left in the city. The trail through the old growth is flat, less than 1 mile long and it’s ‘flip-flop accessible’. After that, lets get some locally roasted coffee and head to West Seattle to explore the beaches of Elliott Bay including Alki Beach, a local favorite for incredible views. This tour is mostly on foot, so wear your comfy shoes and appropriate weather gear.\n\nWith a max of 4 people, this is a very personal \"best of Seattle\" tour that explores the places most visitors never see.

Ideal for the traveler who wants a more relaxing experience than with a large group. You'll have the guide all to yourself. It's also great for small groups of family and friends, public figures who want to enjoy the experience in an atmosphere free of bothersome, critical or nosy people. \n\nFinally, the experience is completely customize able. We can take you on one of our standard hikes or go over a list together before hand. Want to start early and do 2-3 hikes in one day? Want to visit other local attractions? We'll make it happen.*\n*There is a $100.00 per hour fee for visiting additional locations or taking extra hikes. Fee will be calculated prior to our adventure and is due beforehand.",

    "description": "We've always had a passion for donuts, but only recently did we realize just how many others do too. And when looking around, we didn't see anything that truly celebrated donuts in all their glory, hence the Underground Donut Tour was born. This tour is for anyone who truly enjoys donuts. At each location, you'll be able to try a curated sample of one of that location's best donuts. Our tours include such favorites as Top Pot Doughnuts, Dahlia Bakery and Daily Dozen Doughnuts in Pike Place Market. \n\nWe also offer much more information about the route, the city, the stops, and more on our website, www.donuttour.com. Check it out today! \n\nWe hope you can join us!",

The walk wasn’t too taxing for us, and the donut/rest stops were perfectly spaced out. \n\nIt turns out that four donuts in two hours is too much for me, so next time I’ll bring some food-storage containers, so the leftovers don’t get squished in my back pack!\n\nAll in all, 10/10, HIGHLY recommend! We’ll definitely add The Underground Donut Tour to our must-dos in other cities as well!"

This hike takes advantage of a little-known back door to Grand Park, where solitude and wildlife viewing is almost guaranteed.",

Andrew took us off the beaten path into a part of the park we never would have experienced before.  Rather than walking with hundreds of people on the well traveled paths, we saw perhaps 8 others during our entire day.  The payoff was the most remarkably close up, WOW view of Mt. Rainier you can imagine (and we had hiked around Sunrise the day before, which we thought was awesome.)\nAndrew took care of all the details, brought extra water, snacks, hats- you name it.  He is a delightful, interesting guy, and it made our hike more enjoyable to converse with him.  He also gave us insights about what we were seeing and the general area we would not have known. \nMy wife and I are not avid hikers, though we like to be in nature, and have done some hiking back home.  This made it easy to experience the grandeur  of Mt. Rainier.      Also, don't be concerned about lack of lots of reviews. Andrew started his company recently after retiring from his web business.    Let him know your physical abilities and interests and he will tailor the experience for you."

She was not very friendly or talkative. There were also misleading and hidden charges. Different guests on the tour seemed to have paid for different things. At each site she had to figure out who had paid for what. At multiple stops, guests were informed that they would have to pay for entry or wait in the lobby for 30 minutes to two hours while the rest of the group went in. We (and others) ended up paying for events that we were not interested in and not told about beforehand, but we paid so we wouldn't have to sit and twiddle our thumbs for hours. We would not do this tour again."

Shorter and more economical tours are available in our listings \"One Hour Sightseeing Cocktail Cruise\", \"Seattle's Favorite Sightseeing Cruise\", and \"Puget Sound Sailing Adventure.\"\nCruise in the lap of luxury aboard ‘Candére’ during a 3-hour sunset tour on Lake Union. Glide past floating homes and get a good look at Seattle-area highlights including the Space Needle, Gas Works Park, Husky Stadium, and — on a clear day — Mt. Rainier to the south of Lake Washington. With a cocktail in hand, you'll pass by drawbridges, seaplanes, and locals enjoying the lake by kayak while the sun sets.",

Captain Benjamin made everyone feel at ease and assigned each of us a safety related task.  Our goal was to spread my father's ashes behind my mother's girlhood home above Portage Bay and the cruise was a perfect venue for a combination of sightseeing and reflection.  The constant activity with the float planes and other boats keeps you entertained indefinitely! Would definitely recommend this cruise for close up look at lake front life!"

Captain Dylan was our lead in this cruise, he was very nice, kind, and welcoming. he was very knowledgable of the area and the history of it where he was telling us some interesting stories from back then. My family and I really enjoyed it, even though we got some motion sickness LOL. I think I will take this cruise again for my next visit."

    "description": "Your journey begins at the picturesque Bell Harbor Marina, conveniently located along Seattle’s waterfront. As you board the vessel operated by Candere Cruising, you’ll be greeted by friendly staff who will ensure your comfort and safety throughout the voyage. You’ll embark on a scenic cruise through the waters of Puget Sound. Enjoy panoramic views of Seattle’s iconic skyline, the rugged coastline, and on a clear day, stunning views of Mt Rainier. After a leisurely cruise of approximately one hour, you’ll arrive at Blake Island, a tranquil oasis steeped in Native American heritage. Blake Island offers a wealth of outdoor activities for visitors to enjoy. You can explore the island’s lush forests on nature walks, where you’ll encounter ancient cedar trees, and breathtaking views overlooking the sound. Alternatively, you can relax on the sandy beaches, and go beachcombing for shells and driftwood. After a day of exploration and discovery, you’ll reluctantly bid farewell to Blake Island.",

He answered our questions and was attentive with our drinks - and took great pictures of us with views of downtown in the background! My husband and I took this cruise alone and it was one of the most fun things we have done in Seattle over 20 years of visiting. We saw seaplanes take off and land, geese follow our boat, and waved at the various rowing teams going by, and that doesn't even mention all of the city sights we saw. I cannot recommend them enough, it was probably my favorite thing I've ever done in Seattle and that says a lot."

    "description": "This full day private tour brings you two great highlights of the Northwest Washington: the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival and a hike through Deception Pass, Washington's most popular state park.  Our tour includes a morning at the world famous Tulip Festival, a stop in gorgeous seaside town of La Conner for lunch, and an afternoon hike through dramatic Deception Pass State Park. \n\nThroughout the month of April, the Skagit Valley celebrates the coming of spring with the annual Tulip Festival.  Deception Pass is situated between Whidbey and Fidalgo Islands, boasts stunning seaside views, dense old growth forests hugged up against cliffs plunging into the water below and mesmerizing tides that flow and churn like a river between the islands. After our hike, we’ll finish off this unforgettable day with a visit to one of the Skagit Valley’s award-winning wineries for a full complimentary tasting flight.",

Elle est fléchée avec des marques jaunes mais en cas de brouillard épais on ne voit plus les marques.\nEn cas de risque de brumes à venir il vaut mieux avoir un bon GPS qui marche sans internet.\nNous nous étions perdus en septembre 2022\n."
