      "reviewBody": "Höllentour is a film about the 2003 edition of the Tour de France, following the trials and tribulations (of which there are many) of Erik Zabel and Rolf Aldag, two riders of the German &quot;Team Telekom&quot;. But the cameras also show you what goes on before and after the events of the stages, with a few historical bits of film thrown in. It&apos;s a fascinating document about one of the world&apos;s largest sporting events, and it&apos;s even quite interesting if you&apos;re not that keen on Road Race Cycling. At two hours total length however, the film is just a few minutes too long. One or two scenes could have been cut without loosing anything. As this is the only complaint I have I&apos;ll give it 9/10, as it is definitely a film I will buy once it comes out on DVD!",

You understand a woman whom nobody understands, something that is extremely hard to do but Agnes Varda carries it off beautifully.  Her coworkers don&apos;t care for her, her lover isn&apos;t really in-tune with her life, and her best friend likes her, but is busy with her own life.  It isn&apos;t until she meets the someone new, someone who like herself is about to face a real danger, that she not only faces her problem, but can in a sense conquer it.  It&apos;s not an easy film to explain, but it&apos;s beautifully done and a true winner.  I heard that they want to remake it with Madonna.  It would be nice for it to be in English, but a remake isn&apos;t necessary.  They certainly got it right the first time.",

      "reviewBody": "This film suffers tremendously from- by lack of an official or better term - the &quot;Well, duh!&quot; syndrome. Basically, this means the script takes an awful long time to mysteriously build up towards something that everybody already knows because it&apos;s mentioned in every simplest plot synopsis and even in the damn title! Franco Nero, Italy&apos;s finest cinematic export product, is &quot;The Blue-Eyed Bandit&quot;. That&apos;s what the title says, and it&apos;s also unmistakably illustrated via the DVD cover image. And yet, for the first 40-45 minutes, we mainly just witness how Nero&apos;s character - Renzo Dominici - pretends to be grey and pitiable banking clerk who sits alone in his miserably small office and stumbles out of the building as the last employee because of his (fake) crippled leg. Some explanation and background regarding his masterplan to rob his own employer is great, I&apos;m not denying that, but it takes too long and features far too many dull moments. When Dominici eventually does execute his heist, &quot;The Blue-Eyed Bandit&quot; turns into a reasonably entertaining and compelling crime-caper. Since his waterproof plan apparently wasn&apos;t so waterproof after all, Dominici has to deal with (read: get rid of) a handful of annoying persons that know his true identity and want to blackmail him. There are a couple of notable action and suspense moments in the last twenty minutes, but the only real reasons to recommend &quot;The Blue-Eyed Bandit&quot; are Franco Nero&apos;s performance, Dalila Di Lazzaro&apos;s beauty and Ennio Morricone&apos;s music.",

      "reviewBody": "England&apos;s Hammer Studios existed primarily as a distributor--until the low budget 1955 THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT suddenly put the studio on the map. Sensing an untapped market, Hammer began to develop similar titles and by the early 1960s developed a style that mixed Victorian sets and costumes with bouffant hairstyles, bared breasts, and lots of blood. The films were largely responsible for jolting the horror genre back to life on both sides of the Atlantic, as popular in the United States as they were in England.\n\nReleased in 1959, THE MUMMY was among Hammer&apos;s earliest color films and helped lay out the visual style that come to dominate &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; for more than a decade. Drawing from Universal&apos;s 1932 THE MUMMY and 1940 THE MUMMY&apos;S HAND, it opens with a band of Victorian-era archaeologists in Egypt, where they discover the lost tomb of Princess Ananka--and in the process unleash a mummy cursed to guard her throughout eternity. It is a curse that follows the men back to England, where they are stalked to their deaths one by one.\n\nDirector Terence Fisher and cinematographer Jack Asher worked a number of Hammer films, including the earlier HORROR OF Dracula and REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Although some of the lighting may give you pause--judging from all the backlighting and colored filters it would seem the ancient Egyptians had mood lighting installed in their tombs--their efforts result in a series of truly arresting visuals; in their hands, bright color is no obstacle to moodiness. The cast plays it out extremely well, with the lovely Yvonne Furneaux a classic Hammer beauty, Peter Cushing as her archaeologist husband, and (yes, the posture and bearing really is unmistakable) Christopher Lee under wraps for the title role.\n\nThe DVD contains no extras beyond the original trailer, and although the transfer is not pristine it is nonetheless very good indeed. Hammer Horror may not save the world, but it is often a lot of fun--and THE MUMMY is easily among the studio&apos;s best. Recommended.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer",

The opening montage alone is worth renting this movie. A 2 minute music video / opening shows the real streets of New York City and the people that live there. Opening with the statue of liberty, the camera showcases all the different colors, faces and cultures that New York City is made of. Yes Neil Diamond is not a terrific actor....HE&apos;S A SINGER! The amazing talent of Laurence Olivier helps cancel out the bad acting from Neil Diamond. Still, for a singer, Diamond does a good job in this role. For fans of Neil Diamond, this is worth watching for the music alone. Still, I was hoping, out of respect for the original Jazz Singer, have some of the remake made into a silent film. All in all, a nice little movie with good music, even for 1980.",

Michael Baldwin), Mike himself travels through various dimensions and across time itself to learn the origins of the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) in hopes of discovering a way to stop him once and for all.\n\nThe series attempts to return to its roots a bit, dropping most of the humor from the last two entries, and trying for the off-kilter dream-state of the first film. The film is helped a great deal by use of a lot of footage that was filmed for the original back in &apos;79 but that was edited out, so we get several scenes of the characters as they were back then. The origin of the Tall Man is finally established (somewhat), and that will either be a good thing or a frustrating thing for fans of the series. The sections focusing on Reggie tread much of the usual territory, and there are a couple of over the top gags that will delight or disgust. The ending this time is even more ambiguous than usual. The next (and final?) sequel arrived 18 years later.",

      "reviewBody": "Only those who already have an intense interest in Russian classical dance will get much of a lift out of &quot;Ballerina,&quot; a well-meaning but pedestrian behind-the-scenes portrait of five promising members of the Kirov Ballet Company. Through interviews, rehearsal footage, and snippets of actual stage performances, this 76-minute film, written and directed by Bertrand Norman and narrated by Diane Baker, gives us some sense of the discipline, dedication and physical stamina required of any woman who hopes to succeed in this field - women who, in some cases, can go on to achieve near-rock-star status in their home country.\n\nWhat the movie lacks is any real means of making the material come alive for those with little or no interest in ballet. Contrast that with &quot;Ballets Russes,&quot; a far superior documentary that truly does provide a fascinating look at not only some of the premier dancers of all time but the long and distinguished history of ballet itself. Check out that one instead.",

Everyone must see this movie for his acting alone. It really makes me think twice about Steve Martin as an actor."

Miraculously an Indian prince appears, who by accident runs into de Sica and persuades him to be his guide in Rome. The prince is generous, but the problem is that he is totally alien to the Italian mentality and has no idea as how to behave, being totally unrealistic and can&apos;t understand anything of the customs and ways of the strange culture of Italy. Nevertheless, he finally rewards Vittorio de Sica with a real elephant, not a baby but yet small enough to be handled, and of course the children love it. This is very much a film for children, it&apos;s a wonderful tale of the conflict between the happy carefree world of childhood and a reality that just cannot intrude on it. There are many concerns, after all, what do you do with an elephant in the living-room? - but Vittorio de Sica&apos;s unique way of getting out of any trouble mostly by his childish idealism, makes even his wife forgive him..",

Granpa must be really old by now and he just cannot bring that hammer down with enough force to split the young ladies&apos; head apart. I seem to remember him having the same trouble in the first film. The sets for the last half hour are really spaced out and I wonder where they shot it. There is more comedy and tongue-in-cheek humour than in the original film, and the glorifying of the chain saw as a &quot;sacred&quot; object is obviously pushed further! I reckon the directer wanted to get a few things across that he regretted not having put in the original film  ! Picture quality is obviously better than first time round. I would say that what is missing is the novelty effect but with a sequel we obviously cannot expect that. If you liked the original movie, then this one shouldn&apos;t disappoint too much. I wonder what happened to Dennis Hopper in the end !"

      "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t be fooled by the rating. You have to watch &quot;Birdemic&quot; at some point.\n\nThis movies outshines &quot;Troll 2&quot; in every respect. It puts &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; and &quot;The Room&quot; to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making &quot;Birdemic.&quot; At first, you simply won&apos;t be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team&apos;s part.\n\nThe sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn&apos;t have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.\n\nThe acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn&apos;t even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she&apos;s the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is &quot;give your financial backers a small part&quot; bad.\n\nIf you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.\n\nWhile the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the &quot;retirement&quot; scene. I think that the word &quot;retirement&quot; is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It&apos;s hard to miss.\n\nBUT...it&apos;s strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it&apos;s not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can&apos;t tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren&apos;t that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You&apos;ll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.\n\nSo, go rent it. Really. You won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a deceptive little film. First off, because it was made and sat for four years before release, you might be inclined to think it is a dud--but that&apos;s far from true. The film is very good--good enough to almost earn an 8. Second, while the film has some horrific scenes and features Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee, it is not a horror film but more of a drama. So if you see it, don&apos;t expect monsters or madness--instead, there are just bad people and good people doing bad things.\n\nThe film is set in 1840 and Karloff plays an exceptionally skilled surgeon who is dismayed that there are no drugs to alleviate the suffering of patients during surgery. Basically, people were wide awake and felt EVERYTHING during surgery and amputations! This is true, as the first anesthesias didn&apos;t come about until around 1850. Despite his concerns, other doctors didn&apos;t share his enthusiasm for change, so Karloff foolishly begins experimenting on himself--inhaling a mixture of various chemicals (including opium). Not surprisingly, he becomes addicted and this once sweet man becomes an unwilling pawn in the seedy underworld.\n\nThe film gets very high marks for construction, writing, direction and the performance of Karloff. There isn&apos;t much I&apos;d change about the film, though fans of Christopher Lee might be disappointed that his role isn&apos;t that big and his character isn&apos;t that interesting (despite the fact he&apos;s a cold-blooded murderer). Give this intelligent little film a watch--it&apos;s really very good.",

A maid has been given a letter to give the members of the group at dinner.  The letter contains a number of orange pips(pits) that coincides with the remaining number of the group.  After receiving the letter, the member shortly dies after.  This is highly enjoyable fare from the Sherlock Holmes team of Rathbone, Bruce, Dennis Hoey as Lestrade, and director Roy William Neill.  The film zips by at a nice pace, and it has a unique mystery which I could only partially unravel.  Rathbone is at his best, but Bruce tends to steal almost every scene he is in with his mumbling antics and comedic abilities.  The rest of the cast of stalwart British character actors do just as ably with Aubrey Mather really standing out as the genial owner of the home where the Good Comrades stay.  Lots of dark atmosphere, rainy nights, and Scottish lore to surround this intriguing tale."

      "reviewBody": "I couldn&apos;t remember much of this movie when I borrowed it from a friend to watch for the second time... I can&apos;t have been very old when I first saw this, because there were not much more than one scene that I recognized. Even the title seemed new to me. Furthermore, I don&apos;t recall thinking about the film... about what it meant. This contains a lot of sad truth. The scenes of Aykroyd&apos;s character going from the peak of America&apos;s business life to rock bottom in a disturbingly short amount of time provide food for thought. Landis presents these events without pretense or heavy-handedness... he gives us the facts as they are. No bias. This direct, almost indifferent tone makes it all the more scary... this is the way it is, and that&apos;s accepted. The movie also has some insight to prove on racism and greed. Paul Gleason, whom I have only seen in The Breakfast Club(and Not Another Teen Movie, spoofing his character in aforementioned movie) plays a radically different role, yet still shows some of the authority he&apos;s famous for as the principal in The Breakfast Club. That was amusing to watch for someone who enjoyed said film so much. Jamie Lee Curtis bares a lot of skin, for those in the audience looking for that. Aykroyd and Murphy are both extraordinary. They get to play with their characters a lot, to great effect. They create so many funny moments, there are simply too many to list or for mere words to do justice; you&apos;ll just have to watch the film for itself. If you are a fan of either actor, you won&apos;t be disappointed. The language surprised me, with how uncensored it was, compared to today&apos;s standards. The plot is interesting, and based on an intelligent idea. The pacing is dynamic. The acting is all top-notch. The humor is mostly good and tasteful, with few but glaringly obvious exceptions(the fate of Beeks being an almost offensive one). The film has more heart than most of its kind... if you watch only one movie of this type, let this be it. I recommend this to fans of the actors and/or director, and people intrigued by the general idea. If you are even considering watching this... take my advice and do so. It is intelligent without being preachy and funny without trying too hard. John Landis has yet again created something big. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "There are several good, interesting ideas that could have been explored in this movie - one is a blind young man, interested in a serious relationship and wanting to have sex with meaning -- who doesn&apos;t view himself as attractive -- and how he goes about pursuing that relationship and what happens along the way. This movie could play as a drama with comedy or a comedy with drama. Another way it could have gone is the experience of a blind young man who undergoes experimental surgery and the outcome and difficulties encountered along the way. More than likely this would be mostly a drama. Finally, there&apos;s the relationship between a blind man and a sighted woman, a romance based movie, either drama or comedy, or the relationship between a Caucasian American male and an female of Indian descent from a very traditional Indian family, and the difficulties they would encounter along the way, again a drama with some comedy more than likely.\n\nUnfortunately, this movie overreached it grasp. There were some very good moments: the basketball game with the friend, the parents at the hospital while they await the outcome of the surgery, etc. But the whole isn&apos;t even a sum of these parts -- it&apos;s a combination of movies that do not cohere in a way that one can call a success.\n\nIts unfortunate: the idea of a romance comedy that isn&apos;t simplistic, Boy meets Girl, Boy and Girl find love, encounter hindrance, break-up, but Love Wins Out, is a trite, tired formula. This movie had the promise to be a bit more than that, as DEFINITELY, MAYBE attempted and succeeded earlier this year. A longer running time would have helped and a better screenplay.\n\nThe performances was reasonably solid for the budget. Technically, the film is fine, location wise and situation some interesting choices. The biggest weakness is the plot, story and script.\n\nChris Pine deserves some better roles, to see what he can actually make with something more complex and intelligent. Some excellent character actors are wasted, although their performances are fine. There are some unfortunate and unnecessary stereotypes with both the Indian characters and the females set-ups that the Larry character attempts to hook up with Chris Pine&apos;s role as Danny.",

      "name": "a good-natured and polished melodrama",
      "reviewBody": "The film reunites Irene Dunne and Cary Grant for the third and the last time, after their successful pairing in Leo McCarey&apos;s THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937) and MY FAVORITE WIFE (1940). Under the tutelage of George Stevens, PENNY SERENADE is a good-natured and polished melodrama where mishaps and glee alternately emerge around an average couple Julie (Dunne) and Roger Adams (Grant). \n\nOpening with Julie assuming her deliberated departure from Roger in medias res, the narrative consists of a nexus of chronological flashback segued by various melodies in an album coined &quot;The Story of a Happy Marriage&quot; playing from the phonograph, as signifiers to Julie&apos;s memories, how a tuneful and glitched YOU WERE MEAN FOR ME brings Roger to her life, their sequential romance, a spur-of-the-moment marriage and their spell in Japan due to Roger&apos;s work where a seismic shock (both literally and metaphorically) leaves an irremediable missing link in their otherwise content life. \n\nBack to US, Roger starts his print business from the scratch in a small town, that missing link will be mended through adoption, a new life is put into their care and they must get familiar with parental skills (where we get great comedic moments in its slice-of-life simulation) and fight for their baby girl against their unstable financial situation, only to come in for another hammer blow that will (almost) sabotage their marriage, if not for the problematic and expedient ending, the fond memory of a departed can be so quickly and miraculously displaced by the arrival of a new one, is it a blind faith deeply entrenched in the psyche of America at then or that marriage is so unbearable if not for the presence of an offspring? One would gratingly wonder. \n\nSave for that reactionary deus ex machina, the film is a heartfelt blessing from Hollywood-land in a less glamorous and often depreciated genre of melodrama, the two leads give sterling performances here, both shorn of star vanity and completely carry the rather corny story on their own shoulders and shore it up with significant effort to sustain a touching but also realistic vibe that transmogrifies the picture with enduring charisma and yesteryear nostalgia. Cary received his first-ever Oscar nomination for this picture, his Oscar moment is that earnest plead in front of the judge, which rarely emblazons his dramatic showmanship to great extent, but Dunne, admittedly, is the fulcrum of the film here, she is self-deprecating but never shy of inner strength and orthodox femininity, quite a leading lady in her early 40s, why isn&apos;t she more worshiped by new generations? She is the convention-bucking heroine of a sexism business and an impressive 5- times Oscar nominee. Also, Edgar Buchanan and Beulah Bondi both need a shout-out for their supporting turns, the former&apos;s uncle Applejack is the bee&apos;s knees every family needs whereas the latter is so primly respectable by her sheer appearance as the rule-breaking head of the adoption faculty, lastly, to sing a little praise to director George Stevens, what an even-handed actor&apos;s director he is, his style is un-showy but after all, it is the torrid human emotion gets our attention and keeps us watching closely to his performers, that is a different kind of cinematic expertise which no one can deny.",

      "reviewBody": "A highly stylized crime thriller that also manages to work as a tale of adulterous romance in addition to an effective parable of the culture clashes that are apparent between the upper and lower classes. This is a film with multiple agendas, and Ridley Scott, best known at the time for 1979&apos;s ALIEN and 1982&apos;s BLADE RUNNER, is frankly an odd choice to direct such a picture. However, Scott proves himself to be up to the challenge, and film plays like a slightly abstract dream that isn&apos;t afraid to crash down into gritty realism on occasion. With his film noir skills perfected with BLADE RUNNER, Scott turns the focus from the future to an equally idealized version of the present (well, 1987 to be exact), but he maintains the same sense of visual menace and harsh industrialism.\n\nTom Berenger has received a considerable amount of criticism for the irritating fake Brooklyn accent he delivers his lines in, but I overall I found him to be quite acceptable in the role. Even better is Mimi Rogers, who convincingly portrays the detached loneliness of the high society lifestyle without the benefit of screen dialogue that permits her to openly address such an issue. Jerry Orbach and John Rubinstein are also memorable supporting parts, but it is Lorraine Bracco who steals the picture as Berenger&apos;s feisty wife. Long before she was best known as Tony Soprano&apos;s psychiatrist, Bracco brought to the screen the ultimate portrayal of the modern wife and mother - loving but fierce, tough but compassionate, and not afraid to slap some sense into the man who has done her wrong.\n\nAnd I love Sting&apos;s opening rendition of the title Gershwin classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1977 and directed by Joseph Manduke, &quot;Kid Vengeance&quot; (retitled simply &quot;Vengeance&quot;) is a Matzo Ball oater starring Leif Garrett as an adolescent who witnesses his mother&apos;s raping followed by his parent&apos;s murder at the hands of a bandit gang in the Southwest desert. He teams up with a miner (Jim Brown) to enact vengeance and get his sister back (Glynnis O&apos;Connor). Lee Van Cleef plays the outlaw leader.\n\nThis was shot before another Hebraic Western with Van Cleef and Garrett, 1976&apos;s &quot;God&apos;s Gun,&quot; but released afterward. These turned out to be the last two Westerns for Van Cleef. &quot;Kid Vengeance&quot; is better than &quot;God&apos;s Gun&quot; simply because it&apos;s gritty realistic whereas the latter has an uneven semi-camp/parody tone. In any case, Garrett was about 14 during filming and O&apos;Connor was 20-21 whereas Van Cleef looks like he wandered off the set of &quot;Woodstock&quot; with his headband, although they were no doubt used in the Old West. The plot may be hackneyed, but the cast is great. Unfortunately, the movie&apos;s strictly one-dimensional in tone and utterly desolate in location; and therefore a mite tedious. Still, it&apos;s worth checking out if you like the cast and 60s-70&apos;s Westerns.\n\nThe film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Israel.\n\nGRADE: C+",

      "reviewBody": "Roger Corman has done an outstanding job with this film, possibly the best of his Poe adaptations.  Although the film really is an incorporation of two Poe stories....The Masque of the Red Death and Hop-Frog...it is an excellent, atmospheric, quality piece of entertainment.  At the core of the film&apos;s strength are the performance of Price as the evil, malignant, malicious Prince Prospero, follower of the devil and cruel sovereign of an area plagued with a all-consuming Red Death, and the fabulous period sets and costumes, many borrowed from the film Beckett.  Price is at his best, and his turn as Prospero easily ranks as his most sinister and wicked performance(closely running against his portrayal of a witch hunter in The Conquerer Worm).  Vincent Price blends outrageous showmanship with intricate subtleties of a man reasoning why he is what he is.  The dialogue certainly is more important than the action in the story...a reason why some viewers(younger ones more than likely) will find film a bit tiresome.  The sets and costumes are just gorgeous and the film looks like the most lavish ever made by Corman and company.  A true modern masterpiece of the horror cinema!"

      "reviewBody": "I liked Magic. Its a far more sophisticated movie than Child&apos;s Play, Bride of Chucky and other unrealistic horror movies with doll&apos;s taking on a life of their own. In fact, Magic is less horror and more a study of a deeply disturbed man. Hopkins is the shy unsuccessful magician who creates an alter-ego in the form of Fats, his puppet. Together, the magician and Fats make for a very successful act and the magician starts to achieve notable success. When asked to give a health test in order to sign on for a lucrative TV deal, he refuses and runs away. He stays at an isolated island as a paying guest with his now unhappily married college crush - played by Ann-Margret. As romance starts to blossom, the Fats side of Hopkins personality also starts to take over.\n\nMagic reminded me of The Wicker Man - a low budget but chilling Brit horror flick. To be honest, I thought Magic was the better of the two. The similarities it shares with Wicker Man are low budget, reliance on atmosphere, relative realism for the horror genre, a macabre performance by the leading man Hopkins/Christopher Lee respectively and an isolated setting close to the sea. Magic draws the viewer in more because of Hopkins performance which shows likability and vulnerability. 60&apos;s sex symbol Ann-Margret, a talented actress, has yet another small role that completely under utilises her.\n\nI can&apos;t understand the reason for the low rating on IMDb and obscurity of this film. Even after Hopkins carved out a name for himself in the celebrated horror movie Silence of the Lambs, this was never revisited.",

That may not sound terribly original, but the way it&apos;s executed here by director Pawel Pawlikowski is lovely, and this film has a lot going for it. It&apos;s also not as predictable as it may seem.\n\nNatalie Press and Emily Blunt are both brilliant in the lead roles, and easily make this film worth seeing. The moments when Press imitates the devil and when she shows Blunt how a man shags her are priceless. So is seeing Blunt playing the cello and their dancing scene to Goldfrapp&apos;s dreamy &apos;Lovely Head.&apos; The pair have a physical relationship but I liked how restrained Pawlikowski was in showing this. There are wonderful scenes of them disappearing into the flowers and sitting in front of the firelight in silhouette, but what they say and do never feels cliché.\n\nMeanwhile, the patriarchy is on display via the hypocritical brother who has &quot;found God,&quot; the backstory of the father who&apos;s abandoned the family, and the guy who cheats on his wife with a young woman and then ruthlessly discards her. The film is saying something about men and women here, but it&apos;s also saying something about class. I won&apos;t spoil it, but the ending is fantastic. At 86 minutes long, it was the perfect length too.",

      "reviewBody": "By today&apos;s standards, &quot;Dark Victory&quot; might seem cliched.  Of course, that could be because it was so greatly copied!  Here is Bette Davis, a star in the fullness of her talent and ability.  Bette simply shines; she owns this film from first frame to last.  Ably supported by a wonderful cast (including a somewhat mis-matched Humphrey Bogart as an Irish-brogued horse trainer), it is still difficult to watch the film and not be constantly anticipating Bette&apos;s appearance in any scene she isn&apos;t in.  The ending, even in those days, might have turned out either wimpy or waspish.  In Bette&apos;s hands, it is neither.  It works in a way that literally drains one of emotions. I might also add that, while revealing only a bare back, Bette shows more sensuality than a dozen of today&apos;s more &quot;open&quot; actresses.\n\nThere is an old disparaging adage about &quot;showing the full gamut from a to b,&quot; in this movie Bette not only shows A to Z, but some letters that haven&apos;t been invented yet.\n\nDespite my gushing over Ms. Davis, the film is solid in all departments.  If you wish to experience when melodrama is great movie-making, see this film.",

Like the script of &quot;All the Kind Strangers&quot;, the script of this &quot;Suburban Commando&quot; it&apos;s also not great. I watched it with pleasure, because the experienced professional old Burt Kennedy knew how to make a nice film from a second-hand script. I&apos;m not a Hulk Hogan fan but he&apos;s not bad in the role of Ramsey. It&apos;s a pleasure to meet again the crazy pair Christopher Lloyd and Shelley Duvall. And the old Jack Elam, a veteran of many great westerns. The film starts with a Star Wars inspired scene and has some cool tunes along the way: Robert Jason with Almost Like Paradise, KC &amp; The Sunshine Band with Do You Wanna Go Party.",

His delivery is exquisite, there isn&apos;t a single point where you don&apos;t thoroughly believe in his character, that moment where he learns of his father&apos;s fate, but carries on with his duties, it&apos;s incredible.\n\nTha way the story is told is terrific, it moves backwards and forwards somewhat, but it isn&apos;t hard to keep up with, some films leave you baffled, there isn&apos;t a single sense of that here. It&apos;s a war film of sorts, but told from a very unique view point.\n\nThe cinematography is unbelievable, the visuals are striking, there&apos;s an atmosphere and an intimacy about the way it&apos;s shot, it&apos;s remarkable.\n\nHopkins, as I&apos;ve mentioned is remarkable, but the likes of Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, James Fox and Peter Vaughan are all outstanding.\n\n10/10.",

The film begins with an awesome title sequence...some flickering abstract lines, mixed with some deliciously eerie music. Following that (and before the story actually starts), we have one of the most dreadfully boring narrators ever in the history of film, explaining to us what a mask is, and that when the characters in the film put on the mask of the title, we are to do the same with our 3-D specs.\n\nThe story itself is a bore, painfully written and with some ludicrous, laughable acting (my favorite was the grumpy landlady). The 3-D sequences are something else entirely from the rest of this film. You&apos;d think they came from a different movie. They are moody, eerie, well thought out and put together. Some of the in-your-face effects still don&apos;t work well (even in a theatre) but they are hokey good fun. However, once the non-stereo scenes come back on...they are redundant and increasingly annoying. Still, this is a cult classic by any standards, and you can&apos;t help but love it. Understandably, it has quite a following."

      "reviewBody": "Bruce Dern stars as a hippie who gets his son (Michael Pare) and a bunch of other mercenaries to help fight of Adam Ant (Who starts a church of Charles Manson) in this strange post apocalypse action flick. The thing that makes this weird is the cast which includes Bruce Dern, Michael Pare, Adam Ant, Julias Carry, Catharine Mary Stewart and Anthony James who all are offbeat actors with different styles of acting. All that was missing was Wings Hauser. Still I must admit this was a lot of fun due to it&apos;s sheer weirdness. The movie has mutant cannibals, a church of Charles Manson and Bruce Dern as a pot smoking hippie fighter who leads a civilization of flower children. The romance angle between Pare and Stewart is extremely amusing mainly due to the fact that it is just so unlikely. Stewart is of course the resident babe found in these type of movies. Although I was amused to see Stewart scold Michael Pare and Co. for killing mutant cannibals and then laughing about it, to which she goes in a long winded speech about how they are all animals, to which gets (quite understandably may I add) the mercenaries to laugh even harder. The action sequences are for the most part well staged and Adam Ant is really good in the role as the bad guy who is the priest of the church of helter skelter. World Gone Wild is such a bizarre movie one only wishes that this would have turned out to be a television show or at least established some sequels because right here could have been the greatest TV show ever. You could have Pare and Dern protect these villagers every week from some new villain and develop the silliness of the relationship between Stewart and Pare. World Gone Wild is no classic but this is perfect fodder for the B.movie fan who has an appetite for guilty pleasure post apocalypse movies.\n\n* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",

While it is still a cool movie it would have worked just as well in Death Valley than in the Outback.\n\nThe villain this time is a Vampire called Yahoo-Yahweh, a bit of stupid name. It never sounds right when the characters say it. That minor quibble aside it&apos;s another solid entry in the recent Scooby Made For TV feature-length mysteries. Frank Welker (who&apos;s birthday it is today, coincidentally) is back as Fred and Scooby and Kasey Kasem is back as Shaggy (tho Scott Innes was perfect in the previous instalments and it puzzles why he didn&apos;t do Scooby&apos;s voice in the movie). It feels like a slickly animated version of the original show. Especially considering how Warner have decked the characters in their original clothes after fans objected to the modern clothes in the previous efforts. I have no opinion on this matter.\n\n It was cool to see the Hex Girls return and the music this time has a slightly hipper, more techno feel and lacks the orchestral fantasy of Louis Febre&apos;s scores for Alien Invaders and Cyber Chase. It&apos;s a shame there&apos;s no soundtrack CD for this one. I&apos;d definitely buy it.\n\nThe extras consist of a childish game and a commentary by Shaggy, Scooby and Fred. Which should be fun. The DVD is presented in bright and colorful 1.33:1 full frame (as drawn) with an above average Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.",

Looking at the priorities of the main lead was quite refreshing (compared to some movies where the female lead tends to rely quite a bit on the male lead).\n\nThe plot and acting of all the characters is probably one of the best. It was one of those rare times where the villain impressed me as much as the main character.\n\nThe VFX and graphics weren&apos;t as impressive but the plot and characters should be more than enough for that to be overlooked.\n\nI would recommend watching this if you want to find an intriguing supernatural story with a fantastic female lead and villain.",

There was nothing you could say that could make of this movie, it does it all by itself and it doesn&apos;t even allow you to laugh while you watch it going down in flames. I considered its predecessor, Epic Movie, to be among one of the worst movies ever made. I didn&apos;t think it could possibly get worse, but it did. It&apos;s like watching 300 all over again expect with ridiculous pop culture references that aren&apos;t even funny. The guys who made this movie obviously don&apos;t understand comedy in the slightest bit. I hope that this is the last one of these ridiculous comedies that gets to occupy a theater over another film that might actually be worth something. This film is a waste of money for starters, but even if you don&apos;t have to pay, it&apos;s just a waste of time.",

      "reviewBody": "This film gives an incredible account of insects and other little creatures many of which are known to home gardeners who are continually fighting a battle against them.  But here we see the insect life in all its intriguing detail and wondrous colour. The photography is superb. It&apos;s a pity more attention was not given to the sound which comes and goes in an unpredictable fashion.  There is very little commentary so one must just accept the beauty of each particular shot.  One does not have to be a zoologist to enjoy this strange world the inhabiatnts of which outnumber humans on planet earth.\n\nThere is some sound e.g. the flutter of wings and the buzzing of bees but much of the film is silent as one might expect in a world of insects. Music accompanies some of the scenes adding a degree of drama. Two slimy snails are seen touching and fondling each other indicating unmistakably that foreplay has begun and sexual union will follow as the choral music climaxes.  The photographers must have a rare patience to record such intimate and detailed incidents.\n\nThe film is not without its humorous moments.  I thought the caterpillars marching in single file were an absolute gem and evoked genuine laughter. Fascinating too was Mr. Spider working at lightning speed as he wrapped in a shroud his most unfortunate victim.\n\nI found it even more enjoyable on second viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "I tried not to prejudge this film from its IMDb entry because the whole page seemed loaded with politics rather than viewing the film as a film. The voted ratings appeared to be slanted all the way to the negative, while the comments are on the other extreme, and seem to be mostly written by the converted who the film was preaching to. Regardless I thought I would watch it despite not knowing what it was really going to be about.\n\nI found a film that was strong in some areas and weak in others. The strengthen is in its educational value as it discusses the secret genocide of the Armenian people by Turkey in the early twentieth century and how it also dovetails it into other genocides. Knowing almost nothing about this genocide I found these parts of the film to be quite fascinating and revealing as various experts contribution to the discussion of the past as well as the ongoing denials. The former is naturally shocking because of the diaries, stories and photographs paint a typically gutting view of how evil humans can be. However the latter sections are just as fascinating because it is very clear and critical about the powers that be that deny genocides (this one and modern ones); we know this of course but it is never less that shocking to see it.\n\nSystem of a Down deserve credit for using their fame to try and bring the subject to a wider audience by making this film but the problem is that they do actually achieve the opposite effect. At the start of the film there is far too much of a focus on the band and their music and, while this is fine for fans, I personally found it quite off-putting, mainly because I didn&apos;t really care for their music. This meant that I found myself struggling to get into the film in the first 15 minutes. After this though, the film steps back from them a bit and gets better at balancing the mix between documentary on the genocide and less of a rockumentary. The approach does rather mean though that marketing the film is difficult and it is most likely to be watched by those politically aware (the converted) and the band&apos;s fan base, which is certainly a smaller audience than the subject matter deserves.\n\nAn interesting and informative documentary then thanks to the contributions of experts and the sense of history. Just a shame that it spends so much time on the band&apos;s performances because I imagine that would rather deter the casual viewer such as myself."

This is not your normal Hollywood comedy, it&apos;s got more of an &quot;Arrested Development&quot; feel - a funny script and Bob Odenkirk&apos;s direction (and supporting player role) make this work. Basically, this film takes every men&apos;s prison cliché and pushes it ten times further. If you&apos;ve ever wanted to just stay in and drink toilet wine with a loved one, then this film should resonate with you. This is destined to end up a cult movie since it&apos;s not exactly mainstream humor, but if you&apos;re a fan of Odenkirk and David Cross&apos;s &quot;Mr. Show,&quot; you&apos;ll find a lot here to enjoy - and you&apos;ll also find the very tall Brian Posner standing in a crowd scene near the end.",

And there was rarely so little GDR in a film from the GDR film studios DEFA. The whole film is decidedly bourgeois - quotes from Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe are sprinkled in so regularly that you really don&apos;t think you&apos;re witnessing a socialist society. The story of the attractive young Angelika, who is desired by many men and is hardly aware of it, is of course not entirely new. But it is told in a lively and charming way. So that the audience really notices everything, the main actors explain the events as off-camera voices, which also works well. All in all, the film is a small but positive surprise.",

Pete is taken with Natalie. She&apos;s the young daughter of forest ranger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) and lumber company owner Jack (Wes Bentley). Grace has been told many times about a dragon by her father Meacham (Robert Redford). Grace and Natalie find the young boy Pete in the woods and take him in. Meanwhile, Jack&apos;s brother Gavin (Karl Urban) goes hunting for the mysterious creature in the forest.\n\nI like the story, the characters, and the dragon. I can&apos;t help but think that the movie could be much better. It could improve with less money and holding back on showing the dragon. There is a natural questioning of Elliot as a figment of Pete&apos;s imagination that is missing from the audience. By showing the dragon from the start, Elliot is never in doubt. Heck, the dragon is often invisible. It would be more logical for it to be almost entirely invisible and the audience can wonder whether it&apos;s real, imagined, or a projection of Pete&apos;s imagination. The reveal would be infinitely more powerful. I like Bryce and the kids. Karl Urban is a little too broad. Robert Redford is odd in his role. He&apos;s too big of a movie star. The role should go to an elderly character actor from the retirement home. I have no problem with the look of Elliot but it would be more compelling to reveal him much later in the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;To The Devil A Daughter&quot; of 1976 is on of the last films from the great Hammer studios, and, as it seems, it was a disappointment to many of my fellow Hammer fans. For understandable reasons, since this is the second of two Hammer films about Satanism and black magic based on novels by Dennis Wheatley. Both films star Christopher Lee and the first, namely &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot; of 1968 is easily one of the most brilliant films ever released by this great Production Company. And &quot;To The Devil A Daughter&quot; can not nearly compete with &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;, but, as far as I am considered it is still a creepy film that is more than worth watching for a Horror fan.\n\nThe performances are exceptional, and I am not only talking about the great Christopher Lee. Lee is brilliant as always, of course, but the cast includes quite a bunch of other great actors. Richard Widmark also delivers a great performance and so do Denholm Eliott, Michael Goodliffe and the great Honor Blackman. Young Nastassia Kinski is also exceptional in one of her very first roles. The cinematography is great, and the film is often very eerie, but it sadly lacks the wonderful Gothic atmosphere that Hammer fans love so much. The film has atmosphere, no doubt, but sadly not the typical Hammer-style. This may be the main reason why many fellow Hammer fans are disappointed with the film. And it was also the lack of Gothic elements that I disliked about the film. But even though it is definitely one of the lesser films from Hammer and it may disappoint on a certain level, the film is definitely a creepy flick that fans of the studios should not miss. If you expect a shining finale to 20 years of brilliant Hammer rule, you run risk of being disappointed. Just expect a creepy little film with a great cast and enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "In my opinion this movie is still not quite as good as the first movie, it still manages to keep the flavour and charm of the original. \n\nFor me what really stood out about this movie was the villains, which are Zod and his gang and Lex Luthor. Terrance Stamp stole the show as General Zod and really sold me on the character&apos;s arrogance in relation to Earth. This arrogance was best depicted during the whitehouse scene when upon learning that superman would challenge him, he merely retorts &quot;Who is this imbecile?&quot;. What I liked about the Kryptonians in this movie was that all 3 of them were their own character with differing personalities, something which I felt was lacking in Man of Steel (No disrespect to Michael Shannon). Gene Hackman once again is brilliant as Lex Luthor, although for me he was overshadowed by Zod (Which is OK as Zod is the main villain of the movie).\n\nKen Thorne&apos;s score is great and manages to hold up next to the John Williams score of the original.\n\nThe special effects, while appearing dated by todays standards are very good for the time and still look very believable. These effects stood out during Superman&apos;s fight with Zodd in Metropolis and with the depiction of the Phantom Zone at the beginning of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately this is the last of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies that was of high quality. If you&apos;re planning on watching these movies I would recommend that you watch all 4 at least once, but for every subsequent viewing just watch the first 2.\n\nAlso RIP Mr Snake, all he wanted to do was say hi",

      "reviewBody": "Take the secret agent / James Bond craze of the sixties, mix in some concepts from Sax Rohmer&apos;s female Fu Manchu femme fatale and stir in some absurdest twisted revisionism by director Franco - you have the man-hating lesbian Sumuru, or &quot;The 7 Secrets of...&quot; - better known as &quot;The Girl From Rio&quot; in the USA, recalling &quot;That Man From Rio,&quot; which has nothing to do with this. Yes, this does take place in Brazil, we must give it that. Sumuru, or Sumitra as she&apos;s also referred to, is like an evil version of &quot;Modesty Blaise,&quot; played here by actress Eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in &quot;Goldfinger.&quot; There are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene). She controls an entire army of female warriors, colorfully costumed, and rules a city called Femina or something (just outside Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in &quot;The Million Eyes of Sumuru,&quot; sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design &amp; visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated &quot;Some Girls Do,&quot; which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, catches one&apos;s interest, but, after 15 minutes or so, you realize there&apos;s nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.\n\nThe plot follows what seems like a secret agent, a male, arriving in Brazil with 10 million dollars. He catches the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, hamming it up as an elderly Bond-type villain), who sends dark-suited thugs in bowler hats to accost him. This sets everything up for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious Sumuru (the crime lord wants Sumuru&apos;s secrets). Sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that&apos;s one of the secrets. This sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace; there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening: one shot of an arriving airplane, for example, stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop, as if this had never been captured on film before. There&apos;s a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there&apos;s something unusual about it. The fight scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes. To add some production value, there&apos;s a scene of the real Rio carnival about midway through. I&apos;m guessing there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action, such as the lack of even real-looking guns - it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired, falling over unconvincingly. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted. But, mostly, you&apos;ll be rolling your eyes. Hero:3 Villains:5 Femme Fatales:5 Henchmen:4 Fights:3 Stunts/Chases:3 Gadgets:4 Auto:4 Locations:6 Pace:3 overall:4",

      "reviewBody": "Three years after her last film &quot;DU BIST WUNDERBAR / You are wonderful&quot;, the great singer Caterina VALENTE ventured onto the big screen again. Directed by two-time GOLDEN GLOBE winner Kurt HOFFMANN (he received the prestigious Hollywood award for &quot;Felix Krull&quot; and &quot;We Wunderkinder&quot;), VALENTE played a modern Snow White.\n\nDr. Anita Rossi (Caterina VALENTE) works as a heating engineer in Zurich and is supposed to get the heating in an old hotel in St. Moritz up to scratch. Norbert Lang (Walter GILLER) has just inherited the old place, is quite a snob and completely inexperienced in the hotel business. On the journey into the powder snow, the chaotic driver Anita ends up in the circus wagon of a seven-person troupe of jugglers (including Georg THOMALLA and Günther SCHRAMM), who immediately recognize the brilliant Zurich woman as their &quot;Snow White&quot;. It is Anita who gets the acrobatically skilled jugglers a job in the hotel. Anita no longer finds his snobbish boss so unsympathetic, but there is also the busy entertainer Ines Del Mar (Hanne WIEDER), whom the hotel manager has hired as the main attraction for the hotel&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve gala...\n\nThis is certainly not Kurt HOFFMANN&apos;s best film, and Caterina VALENTE never made another trip to the screen after that. Nevertheless, this version of Snow White is excellently filmed and provides a nostalgic treat. Beautiful pictures from Switzerland, lively songs and a lot of charm make this &quot;Frostical&quot; a special experience.",

However, I have to admit that one of my favourite actresses, the beautiful Sylvia Syms not only steals the film but also my heart. The Cambridge scenes and scenery are beautiful too, and as someone who lives near that iconic City it really is shown off at it&apos;s best. Others have suggested this is a film to watch if you have nothing else to do, I disagree, this feelgood film for me is a joy and as such needs to be watched and appreciated for what it is - a lovely piece of our past when things were simpler, happier and more innocent.",

Bafflingly stupid.\n\nThis is one of the few movies so bad that it would even be passed over by nude-scene-hunting horny teenagers. Everything about is bad. There is not a single redeeming quality, not one scene that works, not a single character that isn&apos;t a benign, idiotic one-dimensional drip.\n\nI can&apos;t call this the worst film ever made but it&apos;s close. However, the single worst scene in a movie I have ever seen is Pia Zadora&apos;s nervous breakdown.\n\nQuite simply a waste of vital resources. 1/2* out of ****."

Along the way, Jim Hart befriends Guitar : Carl Mohner , a card player and drunk who often is drinking and playing the guitar . Then the town is terrorized by a nasty band led Livio Lorenzon , but Jim Hart set out to make justice by donning a scarf and Zorro-alike takes down cutthroats . As he takes on a stagecoach assailant , fights against the ordinary villain Livio Lorenzon and helps a weak sheriff against enemies.\n\nIt is a medium budget and boring , at times, Spaghetti Western dealing with customary confrontation between good guys and bad guys , displaying thrills , intrigue , go riding , crossfire, but being really a simple fodder . It is a so-so and plain Pasta Western with a few moments genuinely entertaining , but mostly dull . Stars Cameron Mitchell as a retired pistolero that due to a killer gang is back to gunslinging , Cameron was a tarnished American actor who emigrated to Italy to get fame and fortune playing some Spaghetti Westerns , Peplum , historical and Giallo movies . Co-stars the usually wooden Carl Mohner , though here he gives a passable and sympathetic acting as an alcoholic guitarist , this Austrian character actor played several British and Continental productions from the 50s , such as Peplum , Thrillers , Film Noir , Sword and Sandals and Spaghetti and was also a noted abstract painter , whose works have been exhibited internationally from 1962 . They are accompanied by some familiar faces as the usually baddie Livio Lorenzon, Ugo Fangareggi and brief appearance by Mariangela Giordano as Mary Gordon to be continued a long career in Italian B-films .\n\nIt displays an atmospheric cinematography shot on location in Rome , Lazio and Elios Studios , Rome Italy . And attractive musical score by Marcello Gigante , including some catching songs as Young Jim Hart performed by Peter Travis and Amor Mexicano performed by Rena Pilippini . The motion picture was regularly directed by Sergio Bergonzelli, packing some shortcomings , gaps , failures and flaws . This Italian artisan wrote and directed a series of films in all kinds of genres from the Sixties to end Eighties . As he made Giallo : In the Folds of the Flesh . Adventures : Surcouf , Sea Pirate , Seven in the Sun , Diamond Connection . Terror : Blood Delirium . Erotic or Softcore : Tentazione, Malicia, School of Erotic Enjoyment , Joy , Dirty World , Taxi Love . And Spaghetti or Pasta Western : A stranger in Sacramento , Colt in the Hand of the Devil, Cisco , and The Last Gun . Rating : 4.5/10 . Very average and routine Western , only for hardcore Spaghetti fans .",

She leaves her daughter Marcilla (Ingrid Pitt) under the care of the General. Marcilla befriends his daughter Laura (Pippa Steele) and then the teenager has nightmares, where she is attacked by a dreadful creature. The doctor finds that Laura is anemic and soon she dies.\n\nMarcilla leaves the house and the countess fakes a carriage accident to leave Marcilla, now known as Carmilla, with the wealthy Mr. Roger Morton (George Cole). Camilla befriends Emma Morton (Madeline Smith) and soon she starts having nightmares. Her governess Madame Perrodot (Kate O&apos;Mara) is seduced by Carmilla and helps her to be close to Emma. Mr. Morton travels and the butler Renton (Harvey Hall) and the doctor suspect that Madame Perrodot might be a vampire but they do not suspect of Carmilla. Will Emma be saved from Carmilla?\n\n&quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; is a bold and sexy vampire movie by Hammer with the right dose of eroticism. In 1970, lesbianism was not a usual theme and a lesbian vampire was a novelty. This is the first time that I see a vampire associated to a shroud. The plot explores the sensuality of Ingrid Pitt and her female victims but is never sexploitation. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Carmilla, A Vampira de Karnstein&quot; (&quot;Carmilla, The Karnstein&apos;s Vampire&quot;)\n\nNote: Last time I had seen this movie was on 07 December 2002.",

      "reviewBody": "Overall, I enjoyed &quot;Melody Time&quot; very much. It isn&apos;t as good as &quot;Fantasia&quot;, which I consider a perfect introduction to classical music, but there are some entertaining parts. Elevated by some lovely animation, good songs and cute characters it is very pleasant to watch, even if there are segments that are better than others.\n\n&quot;Once Upon a Wintertime&quot;(9/10)- One of my personal favourite segments from the film. I admit I knew about this one long before seeing &quot;Melody Time&quot; from watching my old Christmas videos. The animation is absolutely gorgeous in this segment, with a nice romantic story and a truly beautiful title song, sublimely sung by Frances Langford.\n\n&quot;Bumble Boogie&quot;(9/10)- When I first heard of this I thought &quot;Rimsky Korsakov jazzed up? How will that turn out?&quot; My verdict is surprisingly entertaining, despite its scant running time and being a tad too rushed, with a cute and endearing title character, nice animation and a clever arrangement of &quot;Flight of the Bumble Bee&quot;. I will say I don&apos;t know what Rimsky Korsakov would make of it though, he was very particular about how he liked his orchestration.\n\n&quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot;(10/10)- My personal favourite. Very colourful visually, with some lively songs and the perfect melodious voice of Dennis Day elevated it to a greater level. Could&apos;ve easily been very dull in terms of story, but the above elements made it worth seeing.\n\n&quot;Little Toot&quot;(8/10)- I have one word for this little segment- CUTE! Little Toot himself is adorable. I loved the animation and music here, the Andrews Sisters have wonderful voices that blend beautifully together. A little too slow in places.\n\n&quot;Trees&quot;(8/10)- Plot-less it is, but it is a visual and musical feast, and the poetic narration was lovely. If only it wasn&apos;t so short! \n\n&quot;Blame it on the Samba&quot;(7/10)- Sorry, this was my least favourite, despite the presence of the wonderful Donald Duck and his little green parrot buddy. Excellent music and decent animation, but the editing and pacing seemed somewhat rushed, and for some strange reason Ethel Smith left me cold.\n\n&quot;Pecos Bill&quot;(8/10)- This is one rootin&apos; tootin&apos; cartoon. While starting off a little tedious and some of the characters were a bit deflated, there were however some very nice backgrounds, funny moments and a corker of a soundtrack. Not to mention the fabulous Roy Rogers, wow! \n\nOverall, uneven mix but pleasant enough. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say anything more! it&apos;s amazing to me that Capcom and Sony have brought the best movie of the series to all of us, and importantly the fans of the video game. Resident Evil Damnation was a spectacular breakthrough, more interesting and better than RE: Degeneration. The Effect and CG was great to me, it showed the monsters extremely vividly, beautiful slow-motions. You must keep your eyes open all almost 2hrs because of the very-fast rhythm and nice action of Leon and Ada. The noteworthy thing is about the Lickers- fast,many and even they were the good assistants (know while watching!!!???). Dramatic has been pushed up to the climax when Leon and Buddy against 2 giant Tyrans. And that was the 2nd anniversary of Leon when he was getting on the brink of death to save someone (1st in RE Degeneration)!!! Will you have a good day off? So let&apos;s buy the DVD or Bluray from 25 Sep. and enjoy it, maybe you&apos;ll agree with my reviews. My rating: 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "When you think of SyFy, you think terrible acting and writing, amateurish-looking special effects, bad visuals and stories that don&apos;t grab you. Heebie Jeebies does have most of those things, but for SyFy it is a long way from being bottom-of-the-barrel. The acting is much better than anticipated, Robert Belushi is a good lead and Cathy Shim is astonishingly beautiful which does hold your attention(most of the ladies fare the same). The scenery and most of the photography is pretty and atmospheric, the gore is pretty good and the music is a rise above the often generic and sluggish-sounding music SyFy is prone to, not great but okay. However, some of the editing is to fast-moving and choppy, not all the time but in too many places. The monster is also the primary reason why Heebie Jeebies is as weird as it is, the design is unique but also very bizarre and somewhat amateurish too. The monster itself is uninteresting with little menace or personality. The dialogue is not that much different from most SyFy movies, the snappy parts come off as forced and cheesy and the more dramatic ones falling into hammy melodrama quality. It does also do a poor job developing the characters with none of them coming off as interesting. The story can get on the silly side- which is often too ridiculous and weird to be properly fun- but there is not much that is really exciting, fun or suspenseful about it(even for a movie that is clearly not meant to be taken seriously). The sense of terror is absent as are the thrills, the horror elements are rather schlocky as well, and the second half takes far too much time on the less important characters, none of them attention-grabbing and some even pointless. The death/attack scenes are handled in a very by-the-numbers way and are somewhat repetitive, the variation in how the monster kills ranges from very little to none. Overall, weird and not particularly good but there has been much worse from SyFy. Worth a look for curiosity and novelty value but not much beyond that, hardly a must watch or must rent. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "In USA, Rabbi Jacob (Marcel Dalio) and Rabbi Zeiligman are traveling back to Paris after a long absence far from his hometown. Meanwhile the bigoted French Victor Pivert (Louis de Funès), who is the owner of a factory, is traveling by car with his Jewish driver Salomon (Henri Guybet) to France to the marriage of his daughter Antoinette Pivert (Miou-Miou). They have a car accident and Pivert fires Salomon and walks on the road looking for help. He stumbles with the Muslin rebel leader Mohamed Larbi Slimane (Claude Giraud) and unintentionally saves the Slimane from assassins that want to kill him. \n\nSlimane abducts him and they head to the Paris airport, chased by the killers and the police. They meet with Rabbis Jacob and Zeiligman that have just arrived in France in the toilet and they impersonate them to escape from the pursuers. When they meet the Jewish community that is welcoming Rabbi Jacob in the airport, they have to proceed in the farce getting in more confusion.\n\n&quot;Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob&quot; is one of the funniest comedies of cinema history, with a complex screenplay entwining the lives of several characters without coincidences but hilarious situations. The story makes fun of polemic themes, like religion and prejudice, and with government economical interests, but is never disrespectful. \n\nLouis de Funès is fantastic with a top-notch performance, considered by fans of the French king of the comedy as his best ever. Unfortunately the studios do not make movies like this anymore. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil); &quot;As Loucas Aventuras de Rabbi Jacob&quot; (&quot;The Crazy Adventures of Rabbi Jacob&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "In 1931, in Berlin, the desperate brother of Anni (Hertha Thiele) can not find a job and is pressed by his unemployed father Franz Bönke. He commits suicide and sooner his family is evicted for nonpayment of rent. Anni&apos;s boyfriend Fritz (Ernst Busch) helps them to move to the summer camp Kuhle Wampe that had become a homeless camp, in the outskirt of Berlin. When Anni gets pregnant, Fritz promises to marry her, but he calls off the wedding after the party. Anni aborts and moves back to Berlin, where she finds a job with other youths in an association that promotes sports.\n\n&quot;Kuhle Wampe oder: Wem gehört die Welt?&quot; is an interesting film that shows the difficult life of the working class in Berlin in times of the Great Depression. I have just watched this film on a DVD released by the Brazilian Distributor Versátil and I found difficult to understand parts of the narrative. However, the running time of the foregoing DVD is only 68:30 minutes and in accordance with the information of the IMDb, the original version has 80 minutes running time; the German censored version has 76 minutes; and the American version has 71 minutes. Therefore, it would be unfair to criticize the fragmented narrative that was cut from the film of the director Slatan Dudow. I read that this film was censored in 1932 and banned by the Nazis in 1933 accused of communist tendencies. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Kuhle Wampe ou A Quem Pertence o Mundo?&quot; (&quot;Kuhle Wampe or To Whom the World Belongs&quot;)",

This movie does not only have the stunning visuals all the big budget Hollywood movies have, but it also has an amazing way of telling history. The movie showed the how cruel a war could be, by telling story of a rich family in Henan province at 1942, when there were a drought and a war threatening. The overall tone was serious, but you will be laughing at some little humors now and then.\n\nI would definitely suggest this movie to anyone who is interested in Chinese culture.

      "reviewBody": "One of the best film of Italian movie history since its foundation and therefore one of the best movies ever made. Astonishig debut by movie director Florestano Vancini, who was unfortunately never able to go even near this gifted artwork for the rest of his career. Working on a powerful story by Italian novelist Giorgio Bassani (The Garden of The Finzi-Continis, The Golden Glasses). For the impressive effort of the cast, all of them taking their respective role characters to epic proportion (while being extremely real and human), and for the black and white photography of night and day war-time Ferrara which reminds sometimes the Vienna of the Third Man by Carol Reed, it is much superior to Rossellini&apos;s Open City and General Della Rovere. It is certainly not strange but still remarkable that the terrible WWII Italian experience has inspired such cogent insight of the human condition. For its immediate impact the movie can be compared to &quot;Two Women&quot;, for its complexity it is certainly superior. To be listed among the hall of world&apos;s masterpieces.",

      "reviewBody": "There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: &quot;The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can&apos;t are both right.&quot;  That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way.\n\n&quot;October Sky&quot; is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950&apos;s. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner. All of his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O&apos;Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else&apos;s. Homer is not exited about that future.\n\nOne night, while everyone stares at the sky, a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same.\n\nFirst, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation.  Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing.\n\nWhen the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they&apos;re forced to end their progresses.\n\nThe performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish. All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released.\n\nThe characters are also extremely well developed. Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all of the characters&apos; motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition.\n\nThe film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer&apos;s love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies, not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers. The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance.  I put up with it without complaining in 1997&apos;s &quot;Inventing the Abbots,&quot; but I have had just about enough this.\n\nBut that is just a minor complaint. With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999.",

A traveling circus takes him in and gives him shelter over the objections of owner Lionel Stander who reluctantly gives in. After that Hill teams up with Bud Spencer, a fellow gunfighter whom he brings out of retirement and Woody Strode who is with the circus, but has his own agenda with that town and its boss.\n\nThe film sadly enough tries to be a comedy, but the laughs don&apos;t quite come in the right places. For the life of me I could not understand the dubbing of Victor Buono who is playing a variation on the part he had in Four For Texas. Buono had one of the most cultured voices in the English language during his lifetime so that just seemed incredibly stupid to me.\n\nBoot Hill marks the farewell performance of Eduardo Ciannelli who was all of 80 years old and looked it. He was dubbed, but his Italian accent would have been really out of place in this western. My guess is that Ciannelli was not in the best of health making this film. Not one I&apos;d want to go out on.\n\nFor those who like the pasta westerns from Europe you might enjoy Boot Hill. But it just isn&apos;t my taste.",

These 4-hours of your life will not be wasted."

      "reviewBody": "Masti is one of the most enjoyable Indian comedies released since &apos;Dil Chatah Hai&apos;, and is a must see for Bollywood movie goers who enjoy comedies and are open minded.\n\nThe start of the movie is superb, with effortless acting and great comic timing shown by the main actors; the first 1/3 of the movie deserves a 10/10. Later however, the film tries to take itself too seriously and fails in some respects; Ajay Devgan showed dry acting for a very dry role, &apos;I hate crime, and i hate criminals&apos;; please...\n\nHowever the dialog remains enjoyable throughout, and the ending seems to tie things up well. The songs are also fun and stay within the plot of the film; i.e. no flying off to different locations around the world changing clothes every few lines.\n\nAs for the girls, Amrita Rao is the Queen of Cute; both she and Lara seem to be the only girls with acting and dancing abilities. However the rest may something to be desired in different departments.\n\nAll round, this movie is packed full of laughs and Masti, which all make up for the lack of plot, and thus Masti is a must see if you enjoy a good laugh.",

      "reviewBody": "Matt Reeves, who is most famous for his monster film &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, took on the task of adapting and directing this film. Two years ago, film festivals were in love with the Swedish Horror film &quot;Let the Right One In&quot; and it was almost a given that it was needed to be made American. In our culture vampires have kind of turned into more of romantic figures and a lot of times represent sexuality. This film goes back to basics and makes this vampire what I think they are sup post to be, which is completely scary and messed up. What is very impressive is that Reeves takes this and in a way, his changes actually enhance the story and kind of makes it better and more entertaining. Kodi Smith-McPhee who was spectacular in last year&apos;s &quot;The Road&quot; and Chloe Moretz who received most of her fame as Hit-Girl in this year&apos;s &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; carry this film and both of these kids bring a type of eeriness; these kids both knew exactly how their characters were sup post to be and they hit it spot on. This gory, terrifying, and dark film turns into some type of odd entertainment and represents why people would even want to see a horror film; it has a strong story and an even stronger scare. Instead of going over the top Reeves bends this movie into a tension roller-coaster more than anything. Very rarely can a foreign film be successfully adapted and made a success in America, but Reeves made something that can stand a distance from the original, but still he true to its origin. It is a great movie for the Halloween season, it will most likely refresh people who are used to &quot;American Vampires&quot; and give them a real vampire movie",

What did Mary say in the first scene at the mall coffee shop? Between the unintelligible way they spoke and the (refreshing) non-expositional quality of the movie, you just have to take it as it comes. Much of the dialogue is poetic and nuanced, the performances from each actor are strong, and the photography is fun. I found it to be poetic and wonderful despite its befuddling aspects.",

The Japanese town that is the setting for &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; is vividly captured by Kurosawa, and the filthy swamp that separates the doctor from the filthiness of the town is brilliant.  Toshiro Mifune plays a tuberculosis stricken gangster who is slowly won over, despite his vicious pride, by the caring but sarcastic doctor.  The swamp is a reflection of the corruption in the town and in one of the first scenes a group of children are seen playing in it.  Kurosawa&apos;s way of foreshadowing these children&apos;s future since the town is controlled by the immoral gangsters.  With the arrival of Okadu, a released convict and gangster, and struggles with his health, Mifune struggles through conflicts of soul which are brilliantly metaphored by Kurosawa.  A great drama with some brilliant commentary about post-WW2 Japan.  Solid characters carry with film about typical with the Doctor being an unforgettable creation and Toshiro Mifune giving a powerful performance.",

      "name": "Good sequel. Decent scary movie!",
      "reviewBody": "I recently re-watched the first Jeepers Creepers and I don&apos;t really get why so many people seem to hate it. Sure, it had quite a disappointing climax and Victor Salva is an infamous figure in Hollywood but his visions did lead to one of the best horror films in the post-Scream era. And the same goes for part two! If you leave logic behind, this is quite an intense and well-elaborated scary movie. Opposite to most directors nowadays, Salva perfectly knows how to create suspenseful situations and emotional devastation. The Creeper (portrayed once again by Jonathan Breck) is a far-fetched new horror icon but it does bring terror in the most isolated outlands of America. This sequel takes place a few days after the original (of which the happenings can be heard on radio-broadcasts all the time) and features a bus full of high school jocks and cheerleaders terrorized by the Creeper. Judging by their fear&apos;s smell, he picks out victims to devour and to re-furnish his rotting corpse. \n\nVictor Salva makes great use of the &apos;surprise element&apos;. All the characters in Jeepers Creepers are equally meaningless so you never really know who will get killed next. Even the most popular jock, the most innocent child or the cutest girl can die at any time and this results in an exiting drop-out race of which you don&apos;t want to miss a second. The film is not as gore as you might think and the stress is more laid on tension. Salva and his crew use the remote location to the fullest and the film contains eerie shots of wide cornfields and roads with no chance for shelter. The cast of young and inexperienced kids do a fairly good job. The only familiar face in Jeepers Creepers 2 is Ray Wise (from the cult series &apos;Twin Peaks&apos;). This film will never be a classic but at least its entertaining horror without much pretension.",

      "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying, if you&apos;ve never seen a Billy Wilder movie, see at least 5 to 10 before seeing this. You won&apos;t appreciate it much unless you want to see Wilder&apos;s roots. This is Wilder&apos;s directorial debut, and it shows. That&apos;s not to say its a bad picture (Wilder didn&apos;t do many bad pictures), it&apos;s just not great.\n\nWhen Nazis took over Austria, Wilder fled to Berlin, and later to Paris. While he was there, he wrote and directed one movie. This is it. While the film is pretty rough and not nearly as tight as his later movies, it definitely shows early aspects of his later films. You will see lots of gags similar to those he would later write with I.A.L. Diamond. Particularly the scene at the water park. Watch carefully for a make-up mirror shot, he later duplicated in The Apartment.\n\nIn between scenes there are one to three minute montages of music and shots that don&apos;t do much for the story, and tend to make your mind wander off a bit. However, one of the film&apos;s most redeeming factors is Franz Waxman&apos;s score. This movie is not only a must-see for Wilder fans, but also for fans of movie scores, as Waxman&apos;s music can be heard in nearly 300 movies, including The Philadelphia Story, Gone With the Wind, Hitchcock classics such as Rear Window and Rebecca, and some of Wilder&apos;s American films like Sunset Blvd., and Stalag 17. Waxman&apos;s music helps deliver nearly all of the jokes, and keeps the movie flowing well.\n\nThe scene that stands out most in the movie, is probably the car chase (wonderfully scored by Waxman, by the way), which is not too shabby considering it was the first film Wilder directed, and on such a low budget.\n\nThis film is important for the careers of Billy Wilder and Franz Waxman and is a must see if you are a fan of either. Was also an early film for Danielle Darrieux who has been acting in films for over 70 years, and is still going.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Pukar is one of the better Hindi films of 2000, which is not saying much since there wasn&apos;t much interesting work that year. Just as you can expect with Santoshi though, who&apos;s known for his gripping, intense films, this one blends action with high drama and towards the end makes it into a thriller of sorts. The story isn&apos;t much of a treasure, but the script makes it into an enjoyable movie experience. The romantic portions are played against a greater backdrop of the army. The leading stars, Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit have great chemistry and their interactions are the film&apos;s best moments. Actually, it&apos;s really interesting that he does not show any romantic interest in her while she does all she can to get him, including sabotage his career in the army in revenge for his rejection. We&apos;ve seen different portrayals of unrequited love in Hindi films, but this part is really quite refreshing, and it works well for the film. Having said that, something is still missing in the film throughout, and it feels not fully realised and at times even a bit bland despite being watchable all the same. Maybe the entire army track just didn&apos;t ring true and took away from the more interesting part which is the story of the two leads.\n\nThe acting elevates the film in ways the script does not. As Jaidev, Anil Kapoor delivers a skillful performance full of grit and authenticity. His dedication to this character shows in every frame, with impressive results. This is similarly one of the best performances of Madhuri Dixit. She is always a delight to watch, but in Pukar, she gets a real, complex and grayish character, which gives her enough scope to explore. Her Anjali is a flawed, imperfect woman driven by ego, desire and jealousy, and Dixit shows great strength as a performer. We see her tormented side, her ugly side, her lack of vanity, her regret and feelings of guilt, her growth. A marvelous performance, indeed. Namrata Shirodkar at playing pretty much herself, though she is treated by the film as a mere ornament. A. R. Rahman composes a wonderful soundtrack. The film&apos;s story picks up towards the end, and its music and script meet at what for me is the film&apos;s highpoint, namely the song &quot;Ek Tu Hi Bharosa&quot;, a true gem of a song, with a live appearance by none other than the legendary Lata Mangeshkar, who sings it on stage. Indeed, a great moment before the story is concluded.",

      "reviewBody": "Whoever made the poster for &quot;Phantasm II&quot; was smart enough to depict the movie&apos;s two drawing points: Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man, and the flying metal ball. Don Coscarelli must have felt like he&apos;d hit the jackpot when Scrimm signed on for the first movie - and all the others. Here is an actor whose very appearance invites fear; he&apos;s like a Jack Palance stand-in. The series&apos; attempts to give him supernatural abilities and yellow blood don&apos;t really amount to much; they should have just let him hang out in the background looking evil.\n\nYou might recall that the first &quot;Phantasm&quot; movie was basically a few neat schlock effects with no cohesive story or characters to string them all together. I remember wondering if the budget was spent entirely on effects that Coscarelli couldn&apos;t wait to show the world - and thus skipped writing a screenplay or developing characters.\n\n&quot;Phantasm II&quot;, which, like all sequels, has an obviously bigger budget, possibly proves my theory to have been incorrect. This one has more schlock effects, but makes no more sense. It also has many of the same flaws as the first one, such as pointless driving scenes with tense music giving the impression the characters are on their way to a showdown, but you never know where they&apos;re going, or why, so the scenes just play as boring filler.\n\nThe bigger budget also apparently paid for some incongruous action-movie like scenes, such as a house exploding, or a car flipping over.\n\nAt least the first five minutes of the movie actually explains what The Tall Man is up to: he robs graves to turn the occupants into zombies who kill the inhabitants of small towns. Then, he moves onto another town&apos;s graveyard, and starts all over again.\n\nThe first movie really should have made that clear.\n\nThis relatively auspicious opening makes the viewer hope &quot;Phantasm II&quot; might make more sense than its prequel.\n\nAlas, it is not to be.",

On the one hand, I have only praise for Alan Rudolph for writing a great character for Julie Christie to play and giving her a role she could truly sink her teeth in and prove again what a sensational actress she is.  And yet - the film that has been built around her is an almost total dud.  I found the plot lame, and Lara Flynn Boyle and Jonny Lee Miller execrable. But when Nick Nolte and especially Julie Christie are on screen, all is forgiven.  They&apos;re great together, but it&apos;s Christie&apos;s film all the way.  She is such a rarity - an actress who combines genuine Movie Star Glamour, the real deal, with a thoroughly modern sensibility.  I could go on gushing, but let me just say that she is sublime and this film gives us an all too rare opportunity to see her in full glory, albeit in a vehicle that&apos;s less than worthy of her.",

      "reviewBody": "The American in Paris theme has been done very often in American cinema. The tradition is huge splashy technicolor with Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Jane Powell, Audrey Hepburn cavorting around the well known streets and landmarks. Those are nice films, but that ain&apos;t what you get here.\n\nNo Louvre, no Arc de Triomphe, no Eiffel Tower, a brief shot of Notre Dame from a distance; that&apos;s about it from the well known Paris. The Paris we see here in this black and white film is of the jazz clubs of the Left Bank where two expatriate musicians, Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier, eke out a living doing what they love.\n\nNewman has ambitions though, he&apos;d like to be a serious composer not a trombonist all his life. Poitier has come to Paris for reasons of the race problems in the USA. \n\nInto their lives two American tourists come, Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll. A couple of dual romances commence. \n\nCarroll and Poitier have a spirited debate over civil rights. The movement is getting into high gear in America and Carroll wants him to return and be part of it. No thanks, says Poitier, he just wants to do his jazz thing where his skin color isn&apos;t anyone&apos;s problem least of all his own. \n\nInterestingly Carroll was doing a kind of warm up for another part of a black woman in Paris on Broadway the following year in Richard Rodgers, No Strings. In that play she falls for an expatriate writer played by Richard Kiley. An interracial romance, one of the first shown on the Broadway stage, still a lot of the same issues were in that show.\n\nParis Blues is a different slice of Parisian life for an American film to explore. All four leads do just fine, though the film probably doesn&apos;t rank in the top work of any of them.\n\nLots of jazz music for the aficionado. And of course the presence of the incomparable Louis Armstrong. The highlight of the film is the jam session with those two ersatz musicians Newman and Poitier.\n\nThe way Satchmo is received by the public only proves the truth of that line he sang in High Society about the way the French love American jazz.",

One negative reviewer even thought the film was set in Mexico which goes to show how much attention he was paying.\n\nThis film is a satire on various aspects of Spanish culture and character, primarily machismo and sexual hypocrisy, but taking in culinary preferences, attitudes to animals and those surreal brandy adverts in the shape of bulls that any visitor to Spain will be familiar with. Bigas Luna chucks it all in the stew and turns the heat up to maximum.\n\nAnd why are so many people upset by the trucks? The film is set next to one of those long dusty highways that are so common in Spain. Of course there are trucks. Take my tip, go to Spain, rent a car, drive between almost any two big cities, stay in a motel at the side of the road, try and sleep - you will get the idea."

I recommend reading the novel(s), where the two leads are 12, not 14, in the beginning and where the Wyoming landscape and Teton Mountains are just as much characters as they are a background for the movie.\n\nNot only is the story watered down and written for cheap laughs and tears, but the pacing is unbearably slow. Jennifer Jason Leigh is clearly not capable of doing justice to the methodically drunken Lydia Callahan, as her portrayal is really more of a caricature than a character; and Tim Sandlin sadly did little justice to his own novel in this screenplay by down-playing Sam Callahan&apos;s inner life as innocent, hopeful commentator on the action of the novel/movie. Much of his biting and insightful humor is lost by removing Sam&apos;s commentary.\n\nRead the book. It&apos;ll take more time, but feel hours shorter than this movie felt."

      "reviewBody": "Permeated by a kind of haughty, stoned decadence, Alan J. Pakula&apos;s &quot;Klute&quot; concerns a sexy, shaggy prostitute in N.Y.C. who is the only real link to a missing family man from suburbia; a close friend of the man asserts himself as detective on the case, and after questioning the girl and trailing her, he finds himself drawn to her. Billed as a mystery-thriller, &quot;Klute&quot; is more of a dramatic character study, with preconceived plot threads devised by two screenwriters who can barely keep their secrets from spilling out. The final moments which piece the story together don&apos;t ring true (starting about the time Jane Fonda attacks Donald Sutherland and runs out into the street), but until then it&apos;s a dandy show-piece for Fonda, who gives an Oscar-winning performance. The ins-and-outs of the hooker-biz aren&apos;t really explored, but we get all we need just by listening to Fonda&apos;s dialogue (her complaints to her psychiatrist, her need for Sutherland&apos;s companionship) and by seeing her living alone in her apartment. For the actress, it&apos;s stellar work; for director Pakula, it&apos;s a bit thin around the edges. ***1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "Vincente Minnelli&apos;s updating of Vicente Blasco Ibanez&apos;s novel is an absorbing melodrama which, as another viewer has noted, must have been watched by Visconti before he made his film The Damned a few years later.\n\nThe film begins with the Desnoyers family gathering for dinner following the return of Heinrich (Karl Boehm) from a spell in Germany where, to the disgust of grandfather Julio, he has been indoctrinated into the ideology of the Nazi party. The grandfather is played by Lee J. Cobb and it&apos;s a blessing that the old boy pegs it during dinner because Cobb not only chews the scenery but the sets and props as well. Despite this, the lines are clearly drawn between the two sides of the family: Heinrich and his father Karl (Paul Lukas) on one side, Julio No&apos; 2 (Glenn Ford) and little sister Chi Chi (Yvette Mimieux) on the other.\n\nJulio is a playboy with no interest in the war; he prowls swish parties for available women, sidling between arguments of the impending war as he closes in on his prey. Sadly, Ford, usually a likable enough leading man, doesn&apos;t possess the necessary predatory swagger to pull of the role. In fact, he is so badly miscast that he seems to be adrift throughout the film, as if trying to figure out how he was ever chosen for the role (Minnelli wanted Alain Delon, apparently, and we can only imagine what an altogether different interpretation he would have given to the part).\n\nThe predicament in which the Desnoyer family find themselves is wholly absorbing as the war slowly tears its members apart. Most imaginable sea-changes in personal opinions are explored during the course of the story, from the discovery of a hidden integrity on Julio&apos;s part, to disillusion on the part of Karl, the WW1 veteran who allows himself to be swept up in the triumphalism of the Nazi&apos;s rise only to find his son becoming irrevocably morally corrupted by the same experiences.\n\nThe movie never won any awards, which is probably how it should be, but it provides an intelligent and literary exploration of a fascinating subject that makes it easy to watch despite its bloated running time.",

Tryon, however, is not only an excellent actor but a good writer as well with a number of books to his name just like Sterling Hayden, another almost forgotten actor of the period.\n\nThis movie should be required viewing in Moral Theology as it provides guidance on how a serious practicing Catholic should act when faced with moral dilemmas. With the current moral divide on the question of abortion, I am reminded of that crucial scene in the movie when the character portrayed by Tryon had to decide on what medical procedure to choose in the case of an emergency arising out of a childbirth gone awry. He was the nearest of kin of the woman involved and the doctors advised him that there was a choice as to whether to abort the baby (by crushing its head with forceps) or let the childbirth proceed in which case the mother&apos;s life would be compromised. In such cases, Catholic morality requires that the best effort should be made to save both infant and mother but in no case may an intervention be made to kill either one of them.",

Andrea is a friend that Mark never heard of from his now deceased friend. Mark invites Andrea to visit as the plans were already made before the accident. Andrea is in Italy, Mark is in Texas.\n\nThis sort of threw me as it is never made fully known how the deceased friend came to know Andea, other than through the internet. Andrea gets around we learn through his conversations with Mark. In my opinion Andrea is a paid escort but he never confesses this to Mark as he discovers that Mark is a very old friend of the dead guy and had great respect for him. Andrea has feelings and doesn&apos;t want to disillusion Mark with his true purpose for the visit.\n\nAndrea goes back to Italy. I state this because Andrea comes across as patronizing and insincere.",

I did not see it as being biased. It is simply the story of poor black Cubans from Alamar-- a black slum &quot;East of Havana&quot; thereby the title-- and their struggles to get a Rap Festival going on in a country where repression and censorship is the rule-of-thumb. That they are unhappy with the totalitarian dictatorship and voice their opinion on it is not surprising. It&apos;s easy to be critical of people living under a repressive government if one like Mr. Docker, lives in a democracy like the U.K. Apparently, Mr. Docker wants the folks in the documentary to repeat the Castro mantra that the U.S. embargo-- which Mr. Docker wrongly calls a &quot;blockade&quot;--is the culprit of all of Cuba&apos;s problems. Cubans are not stupid. They understand that Castro and his tyranny with it&apos;s ridiculous laws is the real culprit. What happened to the billions of dollars that the former U.S.S.R. gave Cuba? Did you know that the U.S.S.R. gave Castro more money during its 30 year patronage of Cuba than the U.S. gave all of Europe under the Marshall plan? Cubans know the truth. What this movie demonstrates is that poor black Cbuans whom Castro claimed that he made his revolution for are very unhappy with his rule and like anyone else yearn for democracy, freedom and prosperity. By the way, I understand that since the movie was made, any independent rappers have been suppressed.\n\nI tip my hat off to the brave men and women who had the courage to voice their opinions on film in a country where any form of dissent can lead to years in the most sordid prisons.\n\nIt&apos;s a great movie. I recommend all to go see it."

Far more unsettling and realistic than the over hyped Guinea Pig series. Obviously without the use of a simple tripod August Underground assaults the senses from the first minute to the last. The movie comes off as something found stowed away in the recesses of a twisted serial killer&apos;s private collection of home videos because the basic plot is two college aged psychos tape their carnage. The acting is amazingly real, the effects are nightmarish. What makes it so realistic is the amateur way it comes off, ironically. With bad blips of home editing, camera shots up in the air and unsteady and the absence of any opening credits it&apos;s hard to believe what you are seeing is a full fledged movie. The camera person never makes an appearance but his sick laughing at his victims along with childish banter with the one killer we do see makes this feel like a homemade episode of Jackass that enters the zone of murder.\n\nThis is not a movie that most people would be able to handle. It takes a strong stomach and a numbed mind for this truly is one of the most extreme and violent pieces ever to make it to video."

      "reviewBody": "Watching The Little Fugitive was an eye-opener for me. I had never heard of Morris Engel, the New York-born director who documented the landing of the Allies in Normandy. Not only is the movie a pleasure to watch but it is reminiscent of the the post-WWII realist school of film. Vittorio de Sica directed movies that have the a similar &quot;look and feel&quot; to them, although his make a social statement. These are well-known to casual movie buffs like me; for example, The Bicycle Thief and Umberto D. Of course, this one is set in Brooklyn and Coney Island and the actors are American, not Italian. \n\nOther than that, all I can say is that this is a classic. It does not pretend to be anything more than a story of two brothers that takes place in the space of a single day. Not only is there a beautiful story, there is also a magical setting that has been captured on film for all time. \n\nAlmost everyone will feel the film as it pulls at their heartstrings. It is set in a time long past; yet people like me who grew up in the fifties can relate to it. The eyes of the camera moving around Coney Island captures people in a time and place that make this film very special.\n\nIt is a tribute to TCM that it brings such films to the screen when the latest pop-culture buzz dictates what TV viewers see. It is gratifying to know that this film has been added to the national film registry in the USA, which is dedicated to the preservation of great movies.",

He is not using stunts again, and he is acting very good. Michel Galabru was fine too, I like him... but he was not too much in the film. I recommend this movie to everybody who likes Belmondo movies. Ohh... I almost forgot, I saw this movie on DVD and the quality of the picture was really awesome. It&apos;s an old movie (it is 24 years old) and they did a good job. Go and see other Belmondo movies, and buy them of course. Georges Lautner&apos;s movie is in my opinion, this movie is 7.5 out of 10. Great action-comedy, Belmondo forever!!!",

Set in Louisiana, a no-nonsense copper Robicheaux investigates the murders of two prostitutes and an ancient murder of a black man. He crosses paths with some angry people and, consequently his life is at risk. The rich atmosphere, sets, presentation of culture and interactions between the characters look very real. Director Bertrand Tavernier really has captured the essence of the place. The cinematography is remarkable and the mesmerizing soundtrack is exceptional. The casting is solid. There is great chemistry between all actors. Tommy Lee Jones delivers is exceptional as Robicheaux. He is effectively supported by fine actors like Mary Steenburgen, Justina Machado, Kelly MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard, John Goodman and Pruitt Taylor Vince. The story is halfbaked and somewhat of a mess as it&apos;s very inconsistent and the conclusion is unsatisfactory. At times, it feels patchy. The editing is quite poor and the pacing is very slow. I&apos;d still say it&apos;s worth seeing for the authentic atmosphere, performances and awesome soundtrack."

      "reviewBody": "Milarepa the movie is the first of a series of two. It depicts the legend of Milarepa. It&apos;s filmed in Tibet - among the all-present towering mountain ranges, which makes the sky and heavens seem so close, and shot in the Tibetan tongue. Both things - combined with the delicate portrait of the people and the culture, and the quiet yet captivating development in this beautiful movie, makes it a movie of grace, a bit of wonder, and of visual beauty. It&apos;s a silence in this movie, which touched my heart.\n\nConcerning the content, this depicts the first part of Milarepa&apos;s journey into spirituality, as it is interpreted in the popular legends of Tibet. I won&apos;t reveal too much, but this movie depicts his family, the harshness of life in Tibet, the upbringing of Milarepa, and the pains they had to undergo. And the way all this shot Mila (he first became -repa, when he became a lama; -repa being the suffix designating this) into the violent world of adulthood, realizing the sufferings of this world for himself.\n\nThe second part to come in this series, depicts Milarepa&apos;s life as a lama, I believe.\n\nThe movie may be a bit slow in its out-folding, and a bit &quot;lacking&quot; in its contents; it has its flaws. But for my part these shortcomings were filled by how the splendor which the themes of the movie, which are very dear to me, was wonderfully spilled out.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched Sannata and found it quiet satisfying. The movie contains all the elements of thrill, horror and suspense. The subtle performances by seasoned actors add an extra punch to the storyline. The movie is also noted for portraying various comedians at different time slots.\n\nA wealthy businessman Girdhari Lal is murdered by his cousin Dhanpat Rai (Bharat Kapoor) for the sake of wealth. Girdhari Lal&apos;s daughter Sapna (Sarika) is in love with Vinod (Deepak Parashar). Dhanpat Rai despises Sapna&apos;s relationship with Vinod and shifts her to a hostel. However the two decide to go straight with Dhanpat Rai and head to his grand manor. Soon the lovers find Dhanpat Rai dead and stuffed in a suitcase. Sapna and Vinod pair up with Police to speed up the investigation. Meanwhile the other members in the manor are being brutally killed by a burnt-face assailant, who has plans of his own.\n\nSannata has several creepy moments but what seems to be truly appealing is the use of sepia-tinted background, which makes it a perfect midnight movie. The story is tightly woven and no action in the film seems useless or inappropriate. Although not close to &apos;Veerana&apos;, &apos;Dahshat&apos; or &apos;Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche&apos; by any means, Sannata surely is far better than most of the other thrillers.",

      "reviewBody": "Viaggio in Italia (1954) was shown in the United States with the translated title Voyage to Italy. The movie was co-written and directed by Roberto Rossellini.\n\nThe film stars Ingrid Bergman as Katherine Joyce and George Sanders as Alex Joyce, her husband. They are both very British. (Sanders was British. Bergman couldn&apos;t handle the English accent.) They no longer love each other. They decide to go to Naples to try to salvage what&apos;s left of their marriage.\n\nA marriage that&apos;s falling apart is a classic narrative. A trip to try to repair the damage is also classic. What&apos;s not classic is why anyone could believe that this marriage could be saved. Sanders tells Bergman that when he&apos;s alone with her he&apos;s bored. (Right.) He leaves Naples for a few days, and when he returns he picks up a prostitute rather than return to Bergman. He drives the prostitute to a park, and then takes home without touching her. (Right.) OK--it&apos;s 1954, but even so that&apos;s a weird scene.\n\nThe ending of the film is so bizarre that it defies description, so I won&apos;t describe it. Voyage to Italy is considered a Very Important Movie, and has a solid IMDB rating of 7.4. Maybe fellow raters saw something in the movie that I didn&apos;t see, or maybe they saw a different movie. I rated it 6, and that was a gift to honor Bergman&apos;s acting skills.",

      "reviewBody": "Hearts of the World (1917) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nD.W. Griffith&apos;s WW1 epic has two Americans (Robert Harron, Lillian Gish) living in France and falling in love. When the German&apos;s attack the man goes off to fight, which ends with devastating results. The actual making of this film is somewhat more interesting than the final product, although the movie is still good but several notches below The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. After that epic 1916 film Griffith wanted to try something bigger and found that the British government was willing to give him full access to anything he wanted. Griffith wanted to shoot real battle scenes and that&apos;s what he did for the film and he nearly once again was killed doing so. The British paid for the film to be made in hopes that it would inspire America to join the war effert. As for the film, it has some brilliant moments but sadly the love story really brings things down, which was somewhat surprising since Griffith is usually good with the melodrama. Harron is decent in his role but not strong enough to carry the film. Gish on the other hands is terrific as usual as is her sister Dorothy. Erich von Stroheim plays one of the German&apos;s in charge. The battle scenes, a lot of them real WW1 footage, is the highlight of the film and like Griffith&apos;s previous two films, it&apos;s rather amazing to see everything play out. This is certainly some of the greatest battlefield scenes I&apos;ve ever watched. There&apos;s also another terrific scene where Gish, fearing her love is dead, tries to find him in the trenches. Gish&apos;s walk mixed with the beautiful cinematography makes this an unforgettable scene. In the end the film is certainly flawed but the battle scenes make it worth at least one viewing."

Being the son of an alcoholic and having my own issues...I get it. Addiction sucks big time. The things they say about it are very true. This movie is not for everyone, but for me it was done well enough for me to realize some things about myself. No movie will ever be perfect about addiction and, of course, they need to lighten if up enough to get audience members. I personally like where she finally starts to realize things. And of course, you can slip now and then until it finally catches on.",

A stage comedy, the movie does justice to its original theatrical version. Cary Grant makes you laugh, even an audience 50 and 60 years after its original release. The story of innocent guilt and laughable situations, other movies like What&apos;s Up Doc, Marvin&apos;s Room, and even Lake Placid (with its moments of ignorance and bliss) have all stolen moments of Arsenic and Old Lace. No one but Cary Grant could have starred in this movie. A delightful performance and an over the top comedic talent was showcased in this comedy classic.",

      "reviewBody": "The wonderful Michel Serrault plays Alex, a semi-vagrant in detachable clothes who walks into strangers&apos; apartments, pretends to be a relation or official to get a meal and bed for the night, before returning to his home in a tenement cubbyhole.  It appears that Alex has not only lost his wife but his job too.  While somehow, HARVEY-like, transforming the lives of those he intrudes upon, he is being shadowed by a double who promptly robs them.  A farcical detective case ensues which, as it typical of French cinema, opts for a troubling, diffuse solution, rather than a straightforward, cathartic one.\n\nThe film is apparently a comedy, from Alex&apos;s clown-like garb to the jaunty, melodic, Tati-esque score.  However, much of the humour is verbal and depends on tortuous word-play that went way over my Intermediate-level-French head.  Even so, there is some charm in Alex&apos;s meetings, the disjunction between an apparent tramp and the generally well-heeled lives he encounters.\n\nIn many ways, Alex is a Benjaminian flaneur, absolved from social expectations after his responsibilities (marital and work) are lifted; he is free, in a way most citizens are not, to negotiate a vast, sprawling, increasingly faceless metropolis, to connect seemingly different people and classes, to trawl through the unnoticed detritus (rubbish bins, sewers etc) that are in fact the lifeblood of any city.  The film which opens with a long shot of a busy street, full of different and opposing lives and desires, becomes something more manageable and comforting.\n\nLinked to this, however, is the loss of a reassuring place in society that work and social relations give; the feeling of being let drift, afloat, unnoticed.  Many lonely lives pass like this, and Serrault, the main reason for watching this film, suggests the melancholy behind his comic facility. This increasing alienation from one&apos;s society, one&apos;s self even, is figured in the double/detective plot.  The figure of the fictional detective actually arose as a result of urbanisation, a reassuring figure who could map out and control the ever-growing, frightening city.  The detectives here, however, are fools, and their solutions are anything but reassuring, slightly disturbing the overall complacency of BONSOIR.",

When I left the cine I asked me the question : Could this be true and yes, certainly. And that its all about, if you leave the cine and keep on thinking about the subject and discuss it with others. I didn&apos;t knew that much about Brit Marling and this film awakened my interest. Good acting and she has many opportunities to go as actress, writer or director. The movie is a must see, but ... it is not that much of a thriller, the action scenes are rather short and don&apos;t ask that much of attention and that is what it is meant to be, because the movie target is to show us how Brit Marling integrates in the East, her feelings, her changes in ideas. But also in the emotional part I find this movie rather general. It seems that they don&apos;t want to go a bit in depth on the subject, keep it simple for the spectator, the client. Keep it mainstream. So, it is not an action movie, but either enters in difficult matters. The subject is although unique and a must see. The end of the movie. Seems that it was time to finish and so they did, a bit in a rush.",

What makes Glitter a bad movie is that it&apos;s a bland, soulless procession of clichés, exactly like Mariah Carey&apos;s songs. And that just makes it boring-bad instead of spectacularly bad. And though Mariah is plenty vacuous in the starring role, she doesn&apos;t reach the heights of strenuously bad acting that Elizabeth Berkeley does in Showgirls. The only element of this movie that satisfies my so-bad-it&apos;s-good criteria is the character of Mariah&apos;s boyfriend. Here you have the whitest man on Earth, saying &apos;hip&apos; things like &quot;I&apos;m a&apos;ight&quot; and &quot;when you got no food in yo crib&quot;.

      "reviewBody": "A film treatment of a well-loved ( despite being prescribed school reading) children&apos;s story is always a delicate matter but here the makers have captured most of the spirit of the original, possibly helped by the fact that Melina Marchetta, the original author, also wrote the screenplay. Josie is the daughter of a single mother of Sicilian background who attends an exclusive Catholic girls&apos; school on a scholarship. Her father, who she has never known, turns up out of the blue as a successful lawyer and she and her mother both have to cope with this not entirely welcome event. Josie, being 17, is also interested in boys, two in particular. One is a nice but insecure kid from the establishment, the other, self confident and sexy, from a single parent home on the other side of the tracks. Also in the story is Josie&apos;s Nona (Grandma), long widowed after a loveless marriage, who lives nearby and keeps a close check on Josie&apos;s doings. Josie&apos;s occasional voice-overs and her lapses into fantasy give the film a slightly Adrian Mole-ish atmosphere, but Josie&apos;s family and friends are not grotesque, just human.\n\nWomen who haven&apos;t had a father while growing up are supposed to find it more difficult to handle adult males and Josie has to learn to deal with a father and boyfriends at the same time. She also has to handle to snobbery at school, not to mention the burden of the dreaded HSC exam in her final year. She is aiming high (law at a prestigious university) so that she can escape from little Italy and the annual tomato sauce bottling. She learns, of course, that you cannot escape from what made you, you can only make it work for you. As in real life, nothing quite works out according to plan, but at the end she&apos;s a year older and wiser. \n\nIt&apos;s Pia Miranda&apos;s film. Her Josie is assertive, vulnerable and warm. A raft of good supporting actors back her up. Greta Scacchi, often cast as a sex bomb, is a blowsy but loving Mum. Anthony La Paglia is a bit of a stock character as the new-found father but has a couple of good scenes. Elena Cotta as Nono and Matthew Newton and Kick Gurry as the silvertail and rough trade boyfriends also do good work. Kerry Walker, so often cast as a female monster, puts in a restrained performance as a firm but sympathetic schoolteacher. I also liked Josie&apos;s two girlfriends Anna and Sara, the &apos;wog chicks&apos; in the old Merc, and their no-holds barred approach to enjoying life despite the HSC and demanding parents. Sydney city vistas are also used to good effect  the bridges, the harbour, Bondi Beach, and there was even a school debate in the foyer of the Opera Theatre. It was nice to get away from the grunge Sydney seen in &apos;Two Hands&apos; etc.\n\nI noticed that though I could hardly be described as being in the target audience for this film I was smiling most of the way through and emerged from the cinema with a reasonably cheerful feeling. It&apos;s not a particularly dramatic story but it&apos;s easy to warm to the characters. A film adaption that works, it seems."

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1983 and directed by Jon Amiel, &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; is a rock drama about a TV reporter (Ellen Barkin) who picks up the story of a legendary early 60&apos;s rock band that prematurely ended when their charismatic leader, Eddie Wilson (Michael Paré), died when his Chevy went off a bridge, although his body was never recovered. The newswoman interviews the living band members 18 years after their heyday and tries to track down the missing tapes to their never-released avant-garde second album. The band members are Frank (Tom Berenger), Joann (Helen Schneider), Sal (Matthew Laurance), Kenny (David Wilson) and Wendell (Michael &quot;Tunes&quot; Antunes), while their bullcrappin&apos; manager is Doc (Joe Pantoliano).\n\nThis was the inspiration for 2009&apos;s &quot;The Perfect Age of Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll&quot; but both movies have their distinctions, as well as pros and cons. &quot;Eddie&quot; is about a band from the early 60s whereas &quot;The Perfect Age&quot; is about a Guns N&apos; Roses-type band whose heyday was in the 80s. Each film starts out shaky as the story is set-up, but they progressively get better. Both films feature charismatic frontmen with diametrically opposed styles, but also very similar when you think about it. Each feature revealing chats amongst the characters with &quot;Eddie&quot; shining in the final act when it unveils Eddie&apos;s youthful place of solitude, Palace of Depression (which is an actual place in southern New Jersey, Vineland; a building made of junk built by the eccentric George Daynor, a former Alaskan gold miner who lost his fortune in the Crash of &apos;29). Growing-up, my gang had several hidden spots where we&apos;d meet, each with a name known only to us; I even had a personal &quot;My Place&quot; in the woods behind my parents house on a lake where I&apos;d often go for private reflection. When I was 15 I planned to commit suicide there, but thankfully didn&apos;t go through with it. The movie gets points for including such an existential element.\n\nWas Eddie still alive or did he die in 1964? The ending reveals the truth and the way it&apos;s done is superlative.\n\nSo which movie is better, &quot;Eddie&quot; or &quot;The Perfect Age&quot;? They both shoot for greatness and in some small ways attain it. Disregarding the rockin&apos; performances, &quot;Eddie&quot; is more location-bound and therefore dramatically sedentary whereas &quot;The Perfect Age&quot; is a road movie in disguise and therefore seemingly more eventful. In my opinion the music&apos;s better in the latter, but then I prefer the heavier side of rock/metal over the Bruce-Springsteen-in-the-early 60s style of &quot;Eddie&quot; (which is good for what it is, don&apos;t get me wrong). &quot;Eddie&quot; stands out for including the Palace of Depression angle and contains superb lines in the final act, but &quot;The Perfect Age&quot; soars in its own way, like Spyder &amp; Eric&apos;s brouhaha in the rain and the blues bar sequence (featuring cameos by legends Sugar Blue, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith and Bob Stroger). Then there&apos;s the powerful climatic scene in &quot;Perfect Age&quot; at Spyder&apos;s ritzy mansion with Jane&apos;s Addiction&apos;s &quot;Three Days&quot; playing in the background, which just so happens to rank with the all-time best cinematic scenes utilizing rock songs, like the close of 1998&apos;s &quot;Buffalo &apos;66&quot; with Yes&apos; incredible &quot;Heart of the Sunrise.&quot; \n\nThe songs by the fictitious Eddie and the Cruisers were composed/performed by John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band. The main song, &quot;On the Dark Side,&quot; became a #1 hit for the band and &quot;Tender Years&quot; was a minor one. Most of the cast weren&apos;t musicians, although Matthew Laurance (Sal) learned how to play bass for the movie. Only Michael &quot;Tunes&quot; Antunes, the sax player for the Beaver Brown Band, and Helen Schneider (Joann) were professional musicians.\n\nSpeaking of whom, I can&apos;t close without mentioning how Helen really shines here. No, she&apos;s no Meryl Streep, but she&apos;s great for her role in &quot;Eddie.&quot; You could say she&apos;s The Perfect Rage of Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll (sorry, that was just DUMB). I should also add that it&apos;s interesting to see Berenger, Barkin and Paré when they were so young.\n\nThe film runs 95 minutes and was shot entirely in New Jersey with the exception of the college sequence, which was filmed just across the Pennsylvania border at Haverford College.\n\nGRADE: B+",

      "reviewBody": "Hollywood doesn&apos;t seem able to put Hemingway&apos;s works on the screen. This is a romanticized version of guerillas fighting in the mountains during the Spanish Civil War. It is supposed to be a &quot;classic&quot; but there are too many weaknesses to give it that status. There is no real tension. Bergman (gorgeously photographed) and Cooper fall in love instantly and we are never in any doubt about that. They are surrounded by some of the talkiest guerilla fighters hiding out in a murky cave (where much of the technicolor action takes place), each with thick accents that don&apos;t seem to match their characters. Katina Paxinou certainly does a stunning job as Pilar--and Akim Tamiroff is more than adequate--but the film becomes weary after the first hour and gets bogged down in too much talk before it finally zeros in on its main action sequence involving the blowup of a bridge. Again, Hollywood fails to inject a Hemingway story with enough human interest and fails to make us care enough about these characters. Transition to the screen just doesn&apos;t work when it comes to Hemingway whose writing style is best confined to the novels he wrote. The only bright note is Victor Young&apos;s pseudo-Spanish score which gives the picture its only lift. Not the film it was hyped to be at the time, depending on its status as a best-seller by Hemingway for a built-in audience. Satisfaction not guaranteed unless you are a huge fan of Bergman and Cooper."

Sure the language is rough but it&apos;s also honest. Brutally honest. The rough language adds to a lot of realism to any otherwise fantastic story. &quot;29th Street&quot; is a beautifully acted movie. Lainie Kazan and Danny Aiello are the two stand-outs. Aiello should have been nominated for an Oscar for his terrific performance. In lesser hands his character wouldn&apos;t have worked. &quot;29th Street&quot; is a wildly emotional movie.

      "reviewBody": "I received an advance screener of the US DVD of this title. What an amazing surprise! A very personal film that was well acted, realistic and suspenseful, without ever becoming unbelievable. Without giving away too much, I have to say that I was blown away by the ending -my sister even cried! The story concerns three lifelong friends (played by Thai pop group D2B, who are apparently the Thai N*Sync) who&apos;ve started their own graphic design firm. One of them is involved in a mysterious car crash and finds himself in the presence of an old woman, a soothsayer, who can seemingly predict the future. Her &quot;omens&quot; (hence the title OMEN) at first seem to warn the boys, allowing them to alter their fates, but more sinister happenings threaten their friendship (and their lives) when a girl enters the picture. The film has rich character development - way more than I&apos;ve come to expect from Hollywood movies, and the plot intertwines Thai superstitions with spiritual issues like reincarnation, and many other paranormal anomalies that create a very creepy atmosphere. The DVD has a ton of features, including trailers, band bios, still galleries, and essays; according to one such essay, one of the actors had a real near-death experience after the film finished, and there is a tribute to him from his fan club on the disc. I was able to find two Easter eggs in the menus, too. One of them is a great Behind-the-Scenes documentary with interviews with the cast and Danny and Oxide Pang. Really cool packaging, too. I can&apos;t remember the last time I received such a pleasant surprise.",

      "reviewBody": "A mysterious man who seems to be in multiple places at the same time is sabotaging Earth&apos;s space-programs in this low-budget and slow-moving French/Italian sci-fi thriller. Typical of &apos;50s films, radiation serves as a preposterous plot driver - unless he is wearing gloves, the man&apos;s briefest touch causes catastrophic radiation poisoning. As revealed in the film&apos;s deceptive (Earth is never approached by a fleet of spaceships) poster, the saboteur is actually a cyborg, and the scenes in which an X-ray reveals machinery and later, when he removes some of his outer &apos;tissue&apos; (a brief and blurry foreshadowing of the climactic &apos;from the ashes&apos; scene in &apos;The Terminator&apos; (1984)) are the film&apos;s highlights. Michel Lemoine is reasonably creepy as Bronco the cyborg - an emotionless agent who seems to have substantial sex appeal (the outcome of his liaison with infatuated Audrey (Jany Clair) is one of the film&apos;s few surprises). The film lacks the visual imagination of most contemporaneous Italian sci-fi films, and there is not much to it beyond a prolonged search for the saboteur with a few science fiction highlights towards the end. For dedicated genre fans only.",

      "reviewBody": "Though based on a horrifying and tragic event, &quot;A Mighty Heart&quot; is a strangely unmoving film. Director Michael Winterbottom throws plenty of details at us about the investigation into the kidnapping of journalist Daniel Pearl by radical Muslims in Pakistan, and the film plays almost like a documentary, even copping the documentary look with lots of hand-held camera shots and jump-cut editing. But the human story gets buried underneath the complex web of details, and despite a solid performance from Angelina Jolie as Pearl&apos;s remarkably stoic wife Mariane, I wasn&apos;t much moved by the film.\n\nWinterbottom doesn&apos;t display a lot of skill at making the details coherent to his audience, and I&apos;m not sure even now who all of the players were or what role they played. He assumes that everyone will already come to the film knowing the story of Daniel and Mariane Pearl, and while I knew the general outline, I wasn&apos;t aware of all the specifics, and this film doesn&apos;t help. It recreates the feeling of coming into a T.V. series after having missed the opening episode, and trying to digest material without being able to put it into context.\n\nGrade: B",

      "reviewBody": "The tiger known as Broken Tail was born in Ranthambhore National Park in northern India, a vast, natural reserve for a wide variety of Indian wildlife, but especially famous for its Bengal tigers. Historically revered in Indian tradition, tigers in the area were once protected by maharajahs, and then by government sanctuaries and conservation projects. But poachers have proved to be nearly unstoppable over the years, and tigers have struggled to survive, even with the protection of the park. At one point, there were as few as 26 tigers left in the reserve, and today, the fate of each and every tiger is important to the species as a whole. Conservation efforts have been intensified in the face of the crisis, and the struggle continues. Broken Tail: A Tiger&apos;s Last Journey is the story of the life and death of a tiger destined for greatness, who may still lead the way to a better future for those of his kind.",

In fact, I liked it even better on the second viewing.\n\nI found it to be one of those rare movies that deals with racism that doesn&apos;t come on too heavy-handed with all the political correctness nonsense. It handled the problem intelligently, I thought.\n\nThe cinematographer, Robert Schaefer, did a terrific job with this, too, and that is another reason I have come to really enjoy this film. The visuals - and the audio - are outstanding.\n\nNone of the characters are particularly likable but I thought Billy Bob Thornton&apos;s &quot;Hank Grotowski&quot; was so interesting a character that I concentrated more on that than whether I liked him or not. However, I wound up liking him, anyway, and boy, did his character change in this film. There is a steamy sex scene in here with Billy Bob and Halle Barry that was quite the talk when the film was released. I didn&apos;t think it was all that it was made out to be. I&apos;ve seen steamier moments such as Alec Baldwin and Kim Bassinger going at it in the non-rated version of &quot;The Getaway.&quot; \n\nOverall, this a rough film in spots but I think it is a solid, underrated drama that offers far more than the &quot;celebrated&quot; sex scene. This is a well-made movie."

      "reviewBody": "The Interpol Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and his partner are investigating the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC) in a joint operation with the District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) from Manhattan in a two hundred million dollars illegal business of weapons trading. They schedule a meeting with an insider informer from IBBC at the Central Station in Berlin; however his partner is mysteriously killed after the encounter. Salinger finds the identity of the informer when he sees that the Vice President of Acquisitions André Clement (Georges Bigot) had died in a car accident. Salinger and Whitman head to Milan where they meet the politician Umberto Calvini (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi), who is great manufacturer of arms, and he explains that IBBC is interested in buying the missile guiding system that he produces in his factory. When Calvini is murdered by a sniper in a political rally, Salinger and Whitman head to New York following the killer and later to Istanbul, and disclose a scheme of arms supply and destabilization of governments to make their nations slaves of debt. Further, the bank is protected by legal systems and only if Salinger crosses the line he might bring some justice to the corrupt system. \n\n&quot;The International&quot; is a surprisingly effective blockbuster thriller. I had lower expectations with this movie, but I really liked it. The complex story of corruption and greedy has flaws, but holds the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The way Louis Salinger easily travels to many countries is strange, since we simple mortals need documentation, money, reservations, connections in the airports, but his character has no problem even when he is chased by the police. In Guggenheim, the always effective police force of the movies takes a long time to come to the place and arrives only after the shooting. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Trama International&quot; (&quot;International Plot&quot;)",

I know there are some things that are a bit weird and over the top but otherwise, this film is hilarious and entertaining!! I find myself laughing at almost every line/scene. I don&apos;t know, maybe its just me but I think Major Payne is a great movie it&apos;s definitely a classic!! Actually I&apos;ve read what another reviewer has written and they seem to agree with me! Thank you at least someone agrees! Anyway Major Payne is great! It&apos;s a movie I&apos;ve watched countless times and each time I watch it I find myself laughing just like I did when I first saw it. It&apos;s really a great movie, so give it a try!",

      "reviewBody": "It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980&apos;s.\n\nIn 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man&apos;s future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who&apos;s unborn son will become mankind&apos;s only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?\n\nWell this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s most popular role. I cannot see why it isn&apos;t. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.\n\nThen you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante&apos;s Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor&apos;s protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease. \n\nThe director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film. \n\nThere are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood&apos;s most famous lines in it, that of Arnie&apos;s &apos;I&apos;ll be back&apos;, a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.\n\nSo, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too &apos;eightish&apos;, and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it, I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent, but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come, a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of &apos;I&apos;ll be back&apos;!\n\nRating: 4.5 stars or 9/10"

Gino agrees on the condition that he can have a fishing boat with the money he&apos;ll receive after a three year sentence. While preparing for the confession Gino is approached by Jerry (Joe Mantegna), a gangster in trouble because he failed to execute orders properly, and they spend a week of thinking in lake Tahoe. At the casino, Gino is mistaken for a powerful mafia boss by a Sicilian who happened to be there and they are mistaken for vips. After the confession fails Gino risks his death but will be saved by Jerry who then joins him in his shoe-shine store.\n\nThe plot looked a bit confusing (and it took me long for understanding it) but the acting was good by all (including Mamet&apos;s frequent co-stars) and there were some funny moments. Not exactly a masterpiece but still a decent time passer if you are stuck at home.",

Full of symbols and deeper meaning. I had no idea what it was about, and was glad I did not read anything about it beforehand. The film is pure enough to be filled with individual associations and references, which is a mark of high art form, at least for me.\n\nBjork is no longer a girl, she is a woman: time and giving birth have laid their mark. She looked stunning to me.\n\nIf you watch it - let it wash over you.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s rather strange seeing Hammer horror in black and white after all the vibrant colours that their later offerings show off so boldly; but the black and white gives it that old monster movie feel (which is what the movie is anyway...) and it&apos;s a good factor for that reason. It&apos;s true that this isn&apos;t Hammer&apos;s finest work, but it&apos;s a very nice early offering; and shows some early ingeniousness of the studio. That&apos;s what I like best about Hammer Horror; when you see one of their movies, you know that you&apos;re going to be in for a fun and imaginative ride and this film certainly delivers on that front. The plot follows botanist Peter Cushing as he joins a group of arctic explorers that go off into the Himalayas in search of the mythical beast - the Yeti. The film then follows, in adventure style, their misadventure as they come face to face with the beast itself and get more than they bargained for...\n\nThe snow setting gives the film a feeling of isolation that invokes a constant feeling of dread and we get the impression that if something bad does happen - there wont be anyone there to save our hero&apos;s. This mind game has been carried off in many films since this one (Alien, most notably), but here is a good early example of that. The film is also different from most other horror films as it handles a subject and a monster that hasn&apos;t often been covered. This sets it apart in a good way as it&apos;s something different from the viewer and also goes some way to showing Hammer&apos;s inventiveness as most studios are happy to continue taking the safe option and making horror films that have been tried and tested. The fact that the Yeti doesn&apos;t appear for much of the film will no doubt annoy some viewers, and it did me somewhat, but it helps the film as it ensures that the audience will be intrigued to finally see the monster. The film is very well paced and doesn&apos;t get boring either, which is a plus.\n\nAs I said, this isn&apos;t Hammer&apos;s best film. However; it&apos;s definitely well worth tracking down for the Hammer fan, and people in general that want to see a good monster movie.",

The funny situations, quotes, tone and style of this movie help hide the fact that not all that much really happens and the premise of this film is absurd.\n\nOne of the biggest questions that fans often had about the show was the taboo subject of whether any of the Brady kids hooked up. A Very Brady Sequel tackles this issue head-on with Greg and Marcia trying to decide whether they should give in to the urges they start to feel for each other. This whole subplot was very interesting, if not also a little uncomfortable at times. Christopher Daniel Barnes and Christine Taylor are great as Greg and Marcia.\n\nThe one role that I felt was perfectly done and helped the movie out the most is Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan Brady. She does an even better job with the role then the original Jan, Eve Plumb. Almost all the scenes with Jan are funny and Jennifer just shines through.\n\nObviously, fans of The Brady Bunch are going to get the most enjoyment out of this. For a newcomer, you might want to check out a few episodes of the TV show first.",

      "reviewBody": "Now most people say this is a ridiculous and pretentious piece of clap-trap but they&apos;re wrong. This is considerably better than most crappy &apos;80s period movies i&apos;ve seen. Joan Crawford plays Monica Rivers, a sexy owner of The Great Rivers Circus who wastes no time in taking advantage of the publicity brought in by a string of murders - two of which happen during a performance - and falls under suspicion, all thanks to the loud-mouth Matilda (Diana Dors). She seems to fall apart with each tragedy and soon everyone - including her daughter (Judy Geeson), the cool-dude tightrope walker (Ty Harding) and the pompous manager (Michael Gough) - wonders if she&apos;s gone &apos;BERSERK&apos;. Despite a few airy-fairy conversations and ludicrous puns, BERSERK is definitely a cult classic and should be seen if you&apos;ve never been to a circus. It makes good use of suspense and you don&apos;t know who is getting it next.",

      "reviewBody": "The film Midway shows in graphic documentary style, the battle that did nothing less than save America and ultimately allow us to win World War II. If the Japanese had prevailed at Midway, they might very well have taken Hawaii and been blockading our continental Pacific coast. We might have had to declare a truce and hope that public opinion would allow us to continue the European and North African war. Remember the USA was brought in to the war because of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, not Hitler&apos;s attack.\n\nThere is a plot of sorts with Charlton Heston as the fictional pilot group commander who&apos;s involved in helping his son Edward Albert help a Nisei family who&apos;ve been interred for the duration of the war because Albert is engaged to the daughter. That&apos;s the one weakness of Midway, the story really wasn&apos;t necessary and detracted with the very precise telling of the Midway tale. Had they left it out, Midway had the potential to be a classic like The Longest Day.\n\nWithout Charlton Heston and his family problems, the story of Midway is told with remarkable historic accuracy. Henry Fonda who played Admiral Chester W. Nimitz in all but name in In Harm&apos;s Way, gets to play Nimitz again in Midway. Robert Mitchum and Glenn Ford play Admirals William Halsey and Raymond Spruance who between the two of them won America&apos;s Pacific war. A whole lot of fine character actors like James Coburn, Robert Wagner, Robert Webber, Hal Holbrook and many more fill their naval roles to precision.\n\nThe story of the Battle of Midway should be told and told again in America&apos;s public schools for future generations. Not just because of the sailors and airmen of America&apos;s greatest generation who fought and prevailed at Midway, but because of just how close a run thing the Battle of Midway was. One very fateful decision by Admirals Yamamoto and Nagumo turned the tide of battle on a dime. By the way the oriental players in Midway like Toshiro Mifune as Yamamoto and James Shigeta as Nagumo and others also play very well. The American cinema certainly came a long way from when they previously cast the Japanese as bucktooth primates. \n\nWhen the viewer sees just how much pure luck played a part in winning at Midway, they will come away with one of two impressions. The first might be that a divine providence is guiding and protecting America. If so, who&apos;s to say that will always be the case. And if not, the second lesson might be that we as a country might not always be so lucky.\n\nIf they could edit out the Heston family story, Midway is a great film for history classes studying World War II.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay so it was a band that ushered the title into the cultural lexicon, originally though it was a Japanese film about teen bikers. I&apos;m not familiar with the band, instead I come to this in my quest for New Wave images, images that catch cinema unawares. Especially Japanese New Wave, which usually resonates closer to the heart of things.\n\nYasuzo Masumura brought the stuff to Japan, having probably been exposed to what was going on at the Left Bank while studying in Italy, and Oshima nourished the seed. From there it grew unexpected roots. In Europe it was about a simple rejection of old values, the old Europe of thinking and theater, and thinking in terms of it (a grand stage, subject/object duality, high purpose revealed by conflict).\n\nIn Japan the youthful energy tapped deeper though, into ancient soul. The rejection of traditional appearances, the peeling of all manner of charged ritual and rigorous formalism, strangely, perhaps inadvertently brought them to the essence of that old tradition. Asymmetry, deliberately broken balance, abstraction hinted at by imperfect forms, all these were discovered anew, with newfound immediacy.\n\nThe rejection here is emblematized by the biker gang, one of many called the Black Emperors. Looking at these teenagers goof around, they are a much tamer version of what the Hell&apos;s Angels were earlier, who it should be noted went on to real gang rapes and real murders but whose formation was after all cinematically inspired (The Wild One, with Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin).\n\nBut at core we find the same ideal-less nihilism; the same gratuitous appropriation of swastikas, the same tribal ceremony of male aggression (there is mention of the elders who founded the group, venerated as ancestral chiefs), the same massive rides meant to strike terror at the decent folks that Hunter Thompson describes in his book about the Angels. More importantly, the same alienation of jobless, aimless young people (here seen loafing in Shinjuku) with too much time and energy and nothing to create. Harmony Korine would love the sense of itinerant recklessness. Kenneth Anger the chrome fetish and boyish impertinence.\n\nMore poignantly yet, it&apos;s Western culture that provides the inspiration, the what-to-reject-for. They write Black Emperors in English instead of kanji, as though meant to equally offend good graces as the swastika between the two words in the logo (ironically a Buddhist symbol). They all smoke rigorously, like movie characters out of Godard. As the mother recites her mantras and counts her prayer beads, the son in the next room cranks up loud rock&apos;n&apos;roll beats on his turntable.\n\nIn music we find another suitable analogy to this. It&apos;s what punk rock was at the time, youthful expression as an abrasive middle finger aimed everywhere. This is an important film in what would eventually become a punk cinema, the No Wave as it were of Sogo Ishii and Tsukamoto, some Miike, that would no longer tap into an ancient soul and would have no burning reason to reject what it did with so much exuberance. I think one because of the other.\n\nSome of these contrasts may be easy; a lesser, catchier documentary would purport to tell a story through them, build up to something. \n\nBut here? Here there is time inbetween. A sense of transience, of a now (often mundane, unmediated by cinema) without fear of past or anticipation of future. Or an emptiness of identity, waiting to be filled. Nothing comes out of this venture eventually, except that they venture out to vent again. The long procession of bikes lined up on the road ready to move off at the end, strangely looks like a kanji of headlights painted on a scroll of Zen calligraphy that points the &apos;middle road&apos;. Something to meditate upon perhaps."

I saw this on late night television in the early seventies and since I was familiar with the novel I enjoyed seeing it and was surprised by how effective Svenson was as the monster. Dan Curtis (Dark Shadows) who produced and adapted this also did a wonderful version of Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde with Jack Palance. I&apos;d like to see that again as well.",

There was certainly some thought put into the story, despite it also looking to be a desperate cash in on the Krampus name so close to the release of the studio produced film.\n\nBesides this however there is only negatives as the writing and acting of this film are atrocious. To make matters worse the film makers clearly do not know how to make a small budget work for them. It helps to have some interesting characters who can fill time with fun dialogue, as well as a bit of flesh thrown in for distraction. However here the dialogue is terribly boring and goes on for far too long without the right pace and editing to make it engaging, and while a little flesh is a good tease, just sticking in some sex for no reason is far too cheap and only serves to highlight the lack of substance that they had to work with.\n\nOverall this movie has nothing to offer apart from a passable idea for what could have been a decent story with more money and expertise behind the project. The main killer for this movie has to be the pace as it is just so, so painfully dull that it takes it away from the &apos;so bad that its funny&apos; realm and puts it in the &apos;why am I even bothering to watch this&apos; category. Avoid.",

If your main prior experience of Aboriginal film is with black and white documentary footage from the 50s and 60s or with the many films examining the impact of white culture on black society and the often tragic results of their interplay, this will turn it on its head. The movies worships nature and the land in the same way Aboriginal culture views the land not as backdrop or something to be exploited, but as almost human itself. Without qualification or embellishment, the camera marvels at the beauty of the landscape, and we do too. The story is set many generations ago, but there is no sense of time; it could be yesterday, or 40,000 years ago. Time hasn&apos;t changed the way of life of the people we are introduced to nor the lessons the young must learn to reach maturity, as our hero Yeeralpiril discovers. David Gulpilil&apos;s narration is so masterful it suggests he has another twenty stories up his sleeve just as beguiling to tell you as this one. Film-making like this is a rare experience.

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes a film has everything going for it on paper and yet somehow manages to mess itself up. &apos;The Warrior&apos;s Way&apos; is actually the opposite. Nothing really should work here and yet it all falls together to make a highly-watchable film.\n\nDong-Gun Jang is the titular &apos;warrior,&apos; but don&apos;t feel too bad if you haven&apos;t heard of him as - apparently - this was his first Hollywood film. He plays an oriental fighter who leaves his native land in disgrace when he finds he&apos;s unable to kill the infant heir of a rival clan. It goes without saying that the story takes place in the past - this sort of thing doesn&apos;t happen that much these days (hopefully!). So he heads to the &apos;Wild West&apos; of America where he settles down in a tiny desert town and looks after his (adopted) daughter. Unfortunately, the clan who he fell foul of has other ideas and follow him over.\n\nHowever, don&apos;t expect wall-to-wall martial arts action from the off. I hope it&apos;s not too much of a &apos;spoiler&apos; to say that all these evil ninjas don&apos;t follow him straight away, leaving plenty of time for our hero to get to know his new townsfolk. And, if you see any of the marketing surrounding this movie you&apos;ll notice that the cast who have obviously been classed as &apos;more familiar&apos; to our Western audiences take prominent positions, namely Kate Bosworth, Geoffrey Rush and Danny Huston. They&apos;re all good, but only get top billing due to most people not knowing who Dong-Gun Jang is and that&apos;s a shame for him as he&apos;s more than capable of headlining a film like this.\n\nDon&apos;t worry, there&apos;s plenty of great action thrown in there, but also a suprising amount of character development thrown in. A lot of people have mentioned how &apos;CGI&apos; it looks. Oddly enough, I&apos;m one of those people who hates computer-generated special effects and finds that - sometimes - too much of them can completely ruin a film for me. However, here they just seem to work. And they don&apos;t come much more excessive that in &apos;The Warrior&apos;s Way.&apos; I doubt there were more than a couple of sets built for the entire production, as almost all the backgrounds are done (or looked like it to me!) on a green screen.\n\nSo, despite looking much like a hour and a half long Playstation 2 cut-scene, the film actually jogs along nicely. There&apos;s humour, fun, characters you&apos;ll care about and obviously a couple of evil baddies who you&apos;ll want to see get what&apos;s coming to them. If you like your martial arts films on the light-hearted side and have a strong tolerance to CGI effects then this is definitely worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a dogme film using location shots, no props, natural lighting as far as possible etc. The story concerns a Yugoslav Serb artist, Dragan adrift in France. He goes into a bookshop to try and buy an art book and meets a girl, Jeanne, who works there somewhat intermittently, and they fall in love. Although they have to speak in English because she can&apos;t speak Serbian and he can&apos;t speak French remarkably they never have to struggle for words (I do tell a lie he does have a problem - once.) One night they are stopped by the police after some drunken bad behaviour on Dragan&apos;s part and Jeanne discovers to her horror that his papers are not in order and he will be allowed three days before being deported by the authorities. His friends had warned him to regularise his stay with the authorities but he had ignored them and now they are both up the proverbial creek. Elodie Bouchet as Jeanne puts in a good performance and the cinematography creates a nice atmosphere from its shots of Paris streets and claustrophobic apartments but the pacing of the film is glacial. There is little or no dramatic tension until Dragan gets his marching orders from the cops, there is no witty dialogue and no real political point to make as in L&apos;Afrance another French film which deals with more or less the same subject but in a rather sharper way.",

      "reviewBody": "Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like &quot;Hoosiers&quot; this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.\n\nLike &quot;Hoosiers&quot; this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree, it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools, minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.\n\nConsequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed, I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First, the All-American end on our team, a superb athlete, was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.\n\nBut my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.\n\nDuring my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with ex-collegiate stars and some pros, we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However, because I had black players on my team I couldn&apos;t schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the mid-west.\n\nSome critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn&apos;t take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.\n\nWhat I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school, these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film.",

With many gratuitous LSD references and a real live carnival freak show, how can you go wrong? \n\nIf you thought Swamp Thing was too intellectual and The Fly was just too gross, this movie might definitely be for you. One of many human-cross-animal or plant movies, what causes this one to stand out is the overall creepiness of Donald Pleasance and, basically, the entire plot (what you can make of it).\n\nTime-lapse photography inserted for no particular reason just adds to the fun. \n\nThe people who made this movie must have had a blast and so will you as long as you&apos;re not some amateur wannabe film critic.

This was the one that showed up on her resume and I came to it without knowing that this is apparently a webseries of shorts where a narrator tells a story on camera but only after they get totally drunk. In this case we have a drunk Allan McLeod slurring his way through a classic Christmas poem while a handful of celebs act it out. It sounds like a great idea full of novelty and laughs but to be honest the joke wears thin very quickly.\n\nMcLeod is amusing because he is drunk but he is not that funny. Meanwhile the reenactment of the poem is full of famous faces but none of them do much other than be good sports in appearing in this short film. It is a shame that more was not done with it – I know these shorts are popular (and apparently led to a full show &quot;Drunk History&quot;) but it really wore thin for me very quickly and even the novelty of the stars didn&apos;t add too much."

It is likely his performance as Hyde here that influenced later cartoon versions and what have you. The menacing stare, those creepy large hands held high ready to strike, the crouched over position, the evil intent in the eyes and the brow. Barrymore is simply fantastic and he pulls this off with much less make-up than many others. It&apos;s amazing how he can also pull off playing the tormented Dr. Jekyll-the complete opposite of Hyde perfectly and shows his tremendous range as an actor.",

      "reviewBody": "Hey! Crazy movie! Oh Gaad it was so boring and depressing! Actually I felt quite privileged to have watched this film. Some people are NOT making films with the intention of being popular, and Bela Tarr is one of them. Satantango is 7 and a quarter hours long, and this one stretches an existential eternity across its 2 hours, bringing us 2 hours closer to death but hopefully nearer to life.\n\nI was looking for symbolic significance from the first achingly long shot, but we were lucky enough to have Tarr interviewed in the cinema afterwards. He scuppered any suggestion of symbolism in his films, insisting that the fact of pointing a camera lens only at things that exist means that metaphysics and allegory are impossible in film. More than a hint of his totalitarian background in his didactic description of his work.\n\nI felt like I had learned something from this film. I thought it showed how life in Hungary can be depressing, a struggle, apparently hopeless, but that the hopelessness only really comes from inside the person. A desperate, selfish man lurks around the drab industrial landscape, fixated on his one motivation, the woman who is his object of desire. He hatches a plan to get rid of her husband. Afterwards the director stated explicitly that the plot is deliberately simple and even banal - the main character delivers one monologue about how all stories dissipate and all heroes dissipate and die away. He stated that the dogs and the rain which both haunt the film are characters and have stories as much as the people.\n\nIf you get the chance, go and watch it. It&apos;s a proper work of art, there&apos;s nothing wrong with it!!!!!!!!!!!"

When I saw the movie I asked myself what we have given up. \n\nThe simple and clear message in the movie is what makes it interesting and good. I saw so many simple things explained in such a profound way. Things such as friendship, family, love, emotions, humanity. \n\nAfter all this is a great movie that shows what humanity is all about. What emotions are, how we see the world because of them. About what is right or wrong. What we sacrifice to create one Utopia. We see in this movie the good in people, but we also can see the cruelty that we are capable of. \n\nTo be completely honest, I saw a little resemblance with another movie. Despite that, It is a movie that I wanted to watch again.",

      "reviewBody": "Someone recommended &quot;The Green Devils of Monte Casino&quot; to me and I was happy I found an English language version (though I wouldn&apos;t have minded captions) on YouTube. It&apos;s interesting because it shows the famous Italian battle from the viewpoint of the German defenders...and what&apos;s more interesting is that it came out only a baker&apos;s dozen years after the war ended.\n\nConsidering that the film was made by post-war Germans, I expected the film to soften the German characters in the movie...and that certainly was the case. No mention was made of the evils of the Third Reich and the whole context for the war was omitted. Additionally, much of the film focused on the good German commander who worked hard to save the precious works of art in the monastery. In addition, the Allies broadcasted what seemed like lies in the film...that the Germans were not moving the art to protect it but to steal it. Well, I hate to break it to you but the Germans DID steal much of the art throughout Europe during the war. So, whether the film was accurate in all respects or not, making it sound as if the Allies were lying just to get the locals upset was disingenuous. There WAS precedent for the Allies saying this...the Germans had done it in the Louvre and many other museums and private collections throughout the continent and many pieces of art still have not been repatriated.\n\nIf you look past all this, the film is decent but not great. I say this because the acting was very good and the story well constructed. But an overreliance on grainy stock footage and the odd way that sometimes images were superimposed on the stock footage just looked cheap. All in all, a flawed but watchable film...worth seeing but don&apos;t take it to be Gospel.",

Alan Bates is superb as a draughtsman in a busy factory and June Ritchie brings a tender portrayal as the object of Vics(Bates) desire. Thora Hird as the mother in law from hell is quite frightening and her scene with Vic Brown being sick behind her sofa is a classic. you filthy pig you filthy disgusting pig\n\nYou can feel her loathing. Some great support from Jack Smethhurst and the always excellent James Bolam. The scene that I favour is where Vic is getting bored with his situation and tries to get sympathy from his sister, his sister suddenly turns on him and tells him to get his life sorted, made bed lie on it etc. An absolutely fantastic slice of early 1960,s life."

The only problem is that the job is in Idaho, which means that his family would have to sell their home in Chicago and move out to Idaho. Several disasters occur as Pryor attempts to pack up and move across country, everything that could possibly go wrong does. The film is not exactly a laugh fest, but Pryor keeps the film entertaining with his great comic energy. Dave Thomas and Dana Carvey are fun in supporting roles, as well as Rodney Dangerfield as a gambling loan officer. Overall, a harmless film that benefits greatly from the presence of Pryor. 5.8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Of the films in what I like to call the Great Ape Trilogy (&quot;King Kong,&quot; &quot;The Son of Kong&quot; and &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;), this is my pet favorite. I loved &quot;The Son of Kong&quot; as a kid but hadn&apos;t seen it in years until I rented it recently from my local public library. Was it as good as I remembered? No -- it was even better!\n\nThis movie generally gets a bad rap, and I admit that some of the criticisms are valid: It was rushed, it can&apos;t compete with &quot;King Kong&quot; in terms of spectacle or horror, it&apos;s a light dessert after a steak dinner. Because it&apos;s a sequel, it is fair to compare it to the original, and in some respects the comparisons are unfavorable. It&apos;s not exactly &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; or &quot;The Godfather Part II.&quot; But it&apos;s a wonderful film in its own right.\n\nThe best thing about &quot;The Son of Kong&quot; is that it makes perfect sense. Carl Denham (played, as in the original, by Robert Armstrong) is being sued by practically everyone in New York for the death and destruction caused by King Kong. That&apos;s exactly what would happen, not just in 1933, but especially today, which gives this old movie an unexpected freshness. Also, because of severe budgetary and time restrictions, the filmmakers knew they couldn&apos;t make another spectacle, so they wisely went in the other direction. The result is a smaller and far more lighthearted film whose titular character is a charming innocent who acts exactly the way a young ape would act. He&apos;s curious, he&apos;s playful and he&apos;s friendly, but he&apos;s also suitably ferocious when attacked or when protecting his human friends, as a watchdog pup would be.\n\nThere&apos;s also a sweetness and compassion about this film, not only in the kindly attitude toward animals, Little Kong in particular, but in the relationship between the remorseful Denham and the lonely Hilda, touchingly played by Helen Mack, a beautiful and underrated actress who gives what I think is the best performance in the picture.\n\n&quot;The Son of Kong&quot; is wonderfully atmospheric, mainly in the scenes on Skull Island but also in those in Dakang and aboard the Venture. Considering they were so rushed to finish the film, the animators and technicians did a superb job, especially the great Willis O&apos;Brien, who reportedly didn&apos;t like the final product. That&apos;s too bad, because he did some of his best work on this movie, as evidenced by Little Kong&apos;s alternately thrilling and amusing fight with a giant cave bear, by the cataclysmic storm and earthquake that rock the island, and by some of the small touches that set O&apos;Brien apart from everyone else in his field. Kudos also go to Max Steiner, whose musical score is almost as good as it was in &quot;King Kong.&quot;\n\nThen there&apos;s the humor, which is delightful, contrasting nicely with the darker and sadder aspects of the film. It&apos;s provided primarily by Mickey the process server (played impishly by Lee Kohlmar) and, of course, by Little Kong himself. Yes, it&apos;s slightly overdone a couple of times, as when Little Kong scratches his head and anthropomorphically shrugs in a display of confusion, but overall it&apos;s a welcome and essential element.\n\nIn addition to Robert Armstrong and Helen Mack, the actors play their parts well. Frank Reicher (returning as Capt. Englehorn), Victor Wong (back in an expanded role as Charlie the cook, whom he plays with dignity and a certain twinkle), John Marston (marvelously slimy as the villainous Helstrom) and Ed Brady (as a surly mutineer) round out a good cast.\n\nRuth Rose&apos;s script is witty, gritty and realistic. It has been criticized for borrowing, clichés and all, from plenty of timeworn tales, but I don&apos;t care. For me, it works. And the finale can mist the eyes of even the strongest man.\n\nAll in all, &quot;The Son of Kong&quot; is a terrific, if brief (only an hour and 10 minutes), adventure. It&apos;s also a love story, as well as a tale of heroic sacrifice and ultimate redemption. I&apos;m happy to say that one of my favorite childhood movies is now one of my favorite adulthood films, too. Here&apos;s looking at you, kid.",

      "reviewBody": "That seeming rarity: an incisive, heartfelt documentary about people doing good that is important, even today as AIDS is not the &apos;plague&apos; it once was. It shows what people will do when they are pushed to a limit - it&apos;s not even about gay rights but about human rights, for proper health-care for the deathly ill. It&apos;s filmmaking that doesn&apos;t shy away from the rougher areas - when there is infighting in ACT UP, the director (first timer David France) shows it warts and all. But it&apos;s the heroism by the likes of Peter Staley and Mark Harrington that shines through the most. As Roger Ebert said, it&apos;s most emotional for the audience with a drama when seeing good people suffer, as do the people in ACT UP and in the AIDS crisis, and in doing good, against all odds. \n\nWe get the sense that they were not just fighting for themselves, though that was certainly a big component, but fighting for the millions that needed the medicine that could at least be attempted. The saddest part is seeing the trial and error over the years, where people who did take the early drugs like ATX just didn&apos;t get better like they should&apos;ve. It&apos;s a bittersweet conclusion since by the time the medicine did get to the point where AIDS was at least something people could try and not, you know, kill them, so many had already passed (the ticker per-year that comes up becomes more and more shocking, albeit a lot of these numbers were from Africa). As a document of the AIDS/HIV crisis and as a pure protest movie and &apos;Fight the Powers That Be!&apos; saga, it&apos;s moving, harsh, and keeps its story moving with compelling people who faced up to the fact that their fight had to be about science even before it being a social issue. \n\nOh, and the sort of &apos;reveal&apos; you don&apos;t even expect in the last ten or so minutes... it shoots this up to being essential viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "I always enjoy watching French movies, and this one&apos;s no exception. In my opinion, this is a very beautiful movie. I love the romance, and the great performances enhance it to the maximum effect. This drama is very well made that you feel emotionally helpless on the mercy of the director. You get involved up to the point that you expect (want) things  to work out like you want them to be but you really can&apos;t predict what&apos;s going to happen next.\n\nThe film tells about a true 16th century story about a man Martin Guerre who comes back to his village and family after an eight-years leave to a war. Everybody&apos;s really happy that he&apos;s come back that nobody questions the changes or differences after that long eight years; until someday a vagabond says that he&apos;s not Martin Guerre. The villagers start to think the possibility that he may not be the man he claims to be.\n\nFor me the film is about our judgment, our perception, our interpretation, our motive. It&apos;s about adding a human value to the rules, ethics, customs, and law that hold our society together. Sometimes what&apos;s right is wrong and what&apos;s wrong is right. In other words, sometimes we&apos;re looking for a &apos;humane&apos; solution. You&apos;ll understand what I mean after you watch this movie.\n\nThe casting is wonderful, especially the casting of Nathalie Baye as Martin&apos;s wife. Something in her eyes  perfectly reflects her character&apos;s sad life. She&apos;s beautiful. I imagine it&apos;s going to be very hard not to sympathize  with  her. Just watch this movie. I hope you&apos;ll be touched and enjoy it as much as I did.",

      "reviewBody": "What could have been an interesting tale of marauding renegade Confederates out for revenge becomes a slapdash, tawdry mess of a film.  Ringleader Palance (a former parson!) and his sons Edwards, Maharis and Roberts, along with a huge gaggle of violent rebels blaze a path across the southwest frontier robbing, raping and burning anything in their midst.  It&apos;s all because their own loved ones were brutalized when they were out killing Union soldiers on a raid.  Finally, Edwards decides he&apos;s had enough and he and his wife (Syms) start over in a new town with an assumed name.  They also have a son.  However, it&apos;s only a matter of time before the relentless Palance and his band of un-merry men make their way to this heretofore quiet town.  Edwards (his svelte, muscular days as a posing strap model long behind him) gives an exceedingly wooden performance.  His character&apos;s motivations rarely make sense because of the weak script and because it&apos;s never really clear what he&apos;s thinking!  Outfitted with Elvis-style porkchop sideburns, he mostly stares blankly and expressionless at the events around him (unless constipation can be considered an expression.)  At the other end of the spectrum is Palance, who mercilessly overacts with an abandon not likely to be found anywhere outside the movie &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;.  His ungodly performance has to be seen to be believed.  Inexplicably drawing out certain words and syllables, screaming at the top of his lungs and throwing over-the-top tantrums every few minutes, he is a profound embarrassment. Maharis is given little to do as the middle son, but Roberts, as the youngest son, gives Palance a run for his money in the ham acting department.  It is excruciating to watch Roberts mug and cajole incessantly through the film.  O&apos;Mara pops up rather briefly as a lame hooker (!) who hobbles around everywhere when she ought to be doing her job.  She finally gets a little more to do near the end.  Brand turns up as the rotund, but caring Marshall of the town Edwards has settled in.  He pays for his friendliness with a sound beating.  The lovely and talented Syms is FAR out of place in a movie this crass and tasteless.  She provides the one ounce of class that the picture has.  The sets look like something that Bonanza would reject as inauthentic, the camerawork is distractingly busy, the editing is choppy to say the least and the music is alternately abysmal and inappropriate.  On good thing the film has going for it is a series of pretty decent action sequences.  Some of the raiding is arrestingly done and there&apos;s a nifty scene onboard a moving train.  The dynamic of the son turning against the father and having a fateful reunion could have been a great one, but unfortunately there were too many weak elements involved to sell it properly.  Another oddity is the prevalence of British actors in the cast (playing Americans.)"

The acting can be terrible, the writing almost always is but you know what you&apos;re getting when you see &apos;Asylum&apos;. THIS MOVIE however firmly puts tongue in cheek and makes fun of other Asylum movies by having aliens recreate the monsters from Asylum movies and attacking earth. It&apos;s the closest thing Asylum has made to a Sharknado movie. In fact, one of the most hilarious parts is when a megalodon tosses the six headed shark into the blades of a helicopter you can&apos;t help but laugh.\n\nThe acting in this one is actually pretty good, and the writing is much better than I&apos;ve come to expect from Asylum. In fact, the guy playing &apos;Actor&apos; needs to be brought back in more movies because he just keeps you laughing every scene he&apos;s in. This is probably the first Asylum movie that I recommend people watch. Worth the time.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Golddiggers of 1933&quot; is a fun movie to watch because all the right elements that went into the making of this motion picture. Mervyn Leroy was truly inspired, and his direction clearly shows he was in total command. The contribution made by the incomparable Busby Berkeley is one of the best things in the film. His choreography for the big production numbers is one of the most impressive thing he did for the movies.\n\nThe film is a sweet story about young hopefuls in New York trying to make it in the musical theater. Thus, we find the impoverished room mates, Carol, Trixie and Polly, who are so poor they have to steal their neighbor&apos;s milk! These young women are at the end of their rope when Barney, the Broadway impresario comes by to tell them about the new show he is working on. The only trouble, he has no money for it.\n\nHow naive and wonderful those movies that came during the great depression were! Everything was possible, in spite of what was happening in the country at the time. In fact, this film, as well as others of that era, served as an excuse for people that were facing a hard time making ends meet for escaping it all when watching a movie like this one.\n\nThe cast is excellent. Warren William, Joan Blondell, Aline McMahon, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Ned Sparks, Ginger Rogers, and Guy Kibbee giving performances that endeared them to the American public of the time.\n\nThe production number of &quot;Shadow Waltz&quot; has to be one of the best ones in this musical genre ever produced. The number is an amazing one and a tribute to the man who staged it, Busby Berkley.

He was very classy with this movie, good job on his part. \n\nActing was good throughout the movie, Jack Nicholson did a good job, I especially liked Benicio Del Toro&apos;s part, even though it was not too long.\n\n I don&apos;t know, pretty much, it&apos;s a good movie, nothing out of the ball park.

The movie also has talented actors who strengthen their characters&apos; storylines, and the technical aspects are surprisingly impressive where especially the cinematography, lighting and production design give the movie a very nice touch, visually. The great score by composer Gaute Storaas sets a beautiful atmosphere that also is the cherry on the top of the cake, and all the elements together make the movie to a very appropriate Christmas experience.\n\nThis is a beautifully adapted and well-directed comedy with talented actors and impressive technical aspects. The heartwarming story will make you feel good inside.",

There are no torture or other hardcase tactics used. Instead, the Germans use subtle psychological manipulation, electronic surveillance, and other techniques to amass intelligence on future bombing missions. Featuring Lloyd Nolan, Carl Esmond, Arthur Kennedy, Steven Geray, Craig Stevens, Don Porter, James Seay, Peter Van Eyck, and Kent Smith.\n\nThis is a military training film that uses fictionalized events to illustrate real-world problems and solutions for air combat crews. It was meant for military use only, but got a screening in New York City that made it eligible for a Best Documentary Feature Oscar. That seems like a stretch, as this is a scripted movie with actors playing parts, and not at all what I would consider a documentary.\n\nIt&apos;s entertaining in its depictions of the various sneaky techniques used to ferret out info. I liked one scene where the American being subtly questioned catches on and &quot;reveals&quot; info about the US&apos;s brand new Flash Gordon fighter jets equipped with disintegrator rays and &quot;magnetic arcs&quot;. This was remade as a mainstream feature in 1951 titled Target Unknown, which also featured Steven Geray.",

The cinematography is very good on this picture and the film composition as a whole is very good.  Even if you don&apos;t read French, you should still be able to understand this movie.

      "name": "Interesting commentary on the sexual revolution",
      "reviewBody": "Directed by Serbian filmmaker Dusan Makavejev (also known for directing &apos;Sweet Movie&apos;, and the Australian produced &apos;The Coca-cola Kid&apos;), the film mixes documentary and narrative cinema, to comment on the infiltration of Soviet Communism, sexual politics/sexual revolution, in a political satire. The main drive of the film to begin with is the work of Austrian-American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Dr Wilhelm Reich: His theories of Organon therapy (use of static electricity), and the connection between neuroses in people that is rooted in physical, sexual and social surroundings. This connects also with the work of Alexander Lowen, an American psychotherapist (and student of Reich&apos;s), who practices and teaches Bioenergetic analysis which uses therapeutic body work to associate the mind with the body, and in theory release repressed energy through the body sexually without the act of physical sex. I observed in these sequences a kind of connection to the work of Arthur Janov, and his primal scream therapy.\n\nThe narrative section of the film tells the story of Milena (Milena Dravic) and her sexually promiscuous flatmate Jagoda (Jagoda Kaloper), and their theories and speeches of sexual revolution: &quot;The October revolution was ruined when socialism rejected free love&quot;. They meet a Russian communist figure skater, Ivica (Vladimir Ilivich), who they seduce. But Milena soon discovers that communism has no time for sexuality unless it is first met with physical violence. This seems to be a metaphor for the struggle against Stalinist communism within Yugoslavia since the second world war. But in the film Ivica seems somewhat deluded by the concept of communism (as he states, &quot;communism is a Latin word meaning communal), whilst almost being made rigid by the sexual intentions of Milena.\n\nThe most interesting part of the film is the first part that focuses on the life and work of Wilhem Reich (hence the W. R. in the films title). He first started working in psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud in the 1920&apos;s, but after writing books such as &apos;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&apos;, fled Austria for America, where he settled in Maine. He worked on his theories of orgone therapy, and developed the orgone accumulator, an organic box lined with lead that individuals would sit in and is theorised as giving both therapy to the bodies organs and to sexuality (The use of the orgone accumulator was even endorsed by William S. Burroughs.). Eventually Reich was arrested (more than likely the victim of situation - i.e. he was from behind the iron curtain), and viewed as insane - despite being tried in court. All of his books were burned in New York, supervised by the federal food and drugs administration agents (take from that what you will).\n\nIt is an interesting film. The different strands are connected by the theories of Wilhelm Reich. But it&apos;s one of those films that is probably more interesting to talk about than watch as it is incredibly slow moving, and at times seems to focus on activities (such as bioenergetic analysis), as group fad, and seems to almost fall into a &apos;new age&apos; enlightenment message. Released in 1971, this would make sense, as the sexual revolution was in full &apos;swing&apos;. Despite all of this it is a relatively enjoyable piece of cinema, with some nice ideas in it. But again, the life of W R far outshines the film as a whole.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

At that point, there was no way to get me out of there.\n\nThe remarkable thing about this movie is that every time you think &quot;that is the most ridiculous plot device ever...&quot; something else comes along that blows your socks off. About mid way thru I could not quit laughing. For instance, our heroine sets a ship on collision course with the Evil Count&apos;s space fortress. To save herself, at the last second before the catacylismic collision, SHE JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! And then does the BREAST STROKE! through OUTER SPACE! Oh My God! I can&apos;t stop laughing!\n\n Bottom Line, this movie is WAY funnier than many that TRY to be funny (Spaceballs, Ice Pirates, etc.)"

      "reviewBody": "After having been annoyed by the candy cane music video of Coppola&apos;s &quot;Marie Antoinette,&quot; I went in search of this film again. I had remembered liking &quot;La Nuit de Varennes&quot; when it came out, but 25 years later it looks much, much better.\n\nA hostile person once defined French film as people saying wounding things to each other for an hour and a half, then somebody dies of cancer or a gunshot. This film redeems the stereotype, as people say wounding things to each other for over two hours and nobody dies (on camera, anyway). \n\nImagine &quot;Stagecoach&quot; with politics instead of Catholic redemption, then add a solid, witty script and great acting. Veterans Barrault and Mastroianni give canny, memorable performances and everybody else is just fine.\n\nIf your model for the movies is the roller-coaster or the video game, you will scream in agony. If you would prefer not to be insulted, this film will be balm for the soul. \n\nSince the powers that be have decreed that this film shall fall between the cracks, it&apos;s worth a little research to find it on DVD. Google &quot;That Night in Varennes&quot; and check the first dozen results. It&apos;s the best we can do until the delinquent owners of the film come to their senses.",

It&apos;s not that if you use a chainsaw or a mask that it becomes a TCM duplicate. But I must say that when the killer runs through the woods with his chainsaw the use of lights indeed reminded me of TCM. That said, was it so bad as they say. Yes and no. There are some real mistakes in editing and color grading. You can easily see that different takes were used in editing without looking towards the colors. Another example is when a victims face is squirted full of blood, next shot her face is covered with some spots of the red stuff. But it is an independent flick and Frank W Montag&apos;s first flick so I forgive him but shame on Timo Rose, as a producer he should have seen those things. But the movie itself is a typical slasher story, campfires, sex, a lot of nudity, shaking butts and juggs, close ups of sexy females, wet T-shirts and a lot of blood but again, some wooden performances or cheap fight scene&apos;s were you can easily see that they don&apos;t hit tear this slasher down, but still worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "A preamble from the filmmakers describing Dante Alighieri&apos;s &apos;Inferno&apos; with reference to &quot;vivid realism&quot; raises a profoundly skeptical eyebrow; whether they intend the easily mocked pretension of &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; preaching or simple dramatic flourishes, the movie proper hasn&apos;t even begun and it seems to have aged poorly. Mind you, the concept of the picture is just fine, plainly stirring together the morality tale of Charles Dickens&apos; &apos;A Christmas carol&apos; with the stark imagery of Dante&apos;s vision of Hell. The broad strokes of the plot are quite suitable; Mortimer Judd is even more of a villain than Ebenezer Scrooge, and perhaps more easily compared to the average conservative politician and über-rich businessperson in 2023 than a figure of another eighty years&apos; past. But then, too, while this is hardly the only title to employ such an indelicacy, there&apos;s also no mistaking the use of blackface here. This is to say nothing of the broad, unsubtle forthrightness of the story as it presents. Not even a quarter of the runtime has passed and Henry Otto&apos;s &apos;Dante&apos;s inferno&apos; shows itself to be uneven in various ways, and that impression won&apos;t really change.\n\nPerhaps it&apos;s the notion in Cyrus Wood&apos;s story, or the subsequent screenplay of Edmund Goulding, to tell a modern tale on top of the portrayal of Alighieri&apos;s Hell. Maybe it&apos;s the general ethos that guided the production in various manners. Whatever the case may be, it&apos;s hard not to draw comparison to Italian classic &apos;L&apos;inferno,&apos; produced by Milano Films a full thirteen years before this saw the light of day - and hard not to feel like this is a distinctly lesser creation. It&apos;s characterized by a brusqueness that shortchanges the weight of the narrative or imagery; instances of cheapness in the visuals that diminish their intended value or impact; a peculiar estrangement between one element of this feature and the other, or even between this &quot;Inferno&quot; and Alighieri&apos;s, that subsequently lowers both. So, for example, the artistry we saw in 1911 sometimes seems to have been traded in for empty facades and vague representations more closely resembling the tawdry exploitation flicks that would begin to rear their heads in the 30s. It often seems like the poets aren&apos;t so much taking a journey through the abyss as they are jogging through it, and the picture is decidedly lax about any detail in that component of its storytelling. The depiction and description thereof is emphatically simplified and reduced, and made all the poorer for it, sometimes almost laughably so. The active framing half isn&apos;t much better, coming off as heavy-handed in its ideas, and a little weak in its communication of those ideas, and in tying them together; the climax is mostly well done, though some moments thereof more so than others. The editing is overly curt, and Otto&apos;s direction overzealous; with the latter aspect in mind, the cast sometimes appear to be wildly overacting, even by the standards of an era in which exaggerated facial expressions and body language were not uncommon.\n\nI&apos;ll at least say this much, those behind the scenes mostly turned in good work. Though the editing is often given to excessive swiftness, those performing the work at least demonstrate swell capability. More substantively, the sets are pretty fantastic, above all the imaginative and laborious efforts that are the locales of Dante and Virgil&apos;s sojourn. The costume design is rather terrific, and any effects that are employed tend to look really great. If there&apos;s anything about &apos;Dante&apos;s inferno&apos; that&apos;s outwardly commendable, it&apos;s the work of the crew. With that said, strangely, in all these facets I rather feel that this 1924 movie is inferior to the painstaking endeavor of 1911. Surely that&apos;s a question of the ends to which the carpenters, painters, costumers, and effects artists were guided, rather than any reflection of their skills, but still the disparity is noteworthy. It&apos;s the difference between a carefully conjured, whimsical panoply of imagery both fantastic and earnestly gnarly, versus an exhibition more closely resembling that of a well-financed theater troupe. To add insult to injury, the lighting in some sequences is kind of poor, restricting what we can actually see of this or that.\n\nNone of this is to say that this feature is outright bad, because that&apos;s not true. But it has difficulty striking a balance between its &apos;Carol&apos; and its &apos;Inferno,&apos; and difficulty in making either count and be truly felt by we viewers; both feel insufficient in turn. What I think it comes down to is that in every regard this would have benefited significantly from a more mindful, tactful approach. Not to again draw on a comparison, but the Italian &apos;L&apos;inferno&apos; was accordingly in production for over three years before its release. I don&apos;t know how long it took for this American picture to get made, but it feels in no small part as though it was rushed - developed quickly and incompletely. The big ideas are there, but not the rounding details that would make them matter, nor the fastidious craftsmanship that would help the imagery or storytelling to really make a mark. Thus, while it seems splendid from the outside, once we sit to watch and actively track what it&apos;s doing and how it&apos;s constructed, the viewing experience becomes less than fully satisfying. I still think &apos;Dante&apos;s inferno&apos; is reasonably worthwhile, but it&apos;s nothing remarkable, and nothing for which one needs to go out of their way. There are plenty of other films that should be a higher priority for any viewer, and one of them is thirteen years older. Still, if you have the chance to watch and appreciate the silent era, it&apos;s a decent enough way to spend one&apos;s time.",

      "reviewBody": "A bizarre horror-comedy by Surrealist master Jan Svankmajer that adapts and reinterprets the folk story of Otesanek (aka Greedy Guts) for the big screen.\n\nOtesanek tells the story of the struggle of a childless couple, Bozena and Karel, to hide and control heir piece-of-wood son Otesanek -a freak of nature with an insatiable appetite that they brought to life- and to stop him behaving wildly.\n\nThe film re-examines the myth of the primeval creation, in which the natural order is subverted and disrespected. The couple succumbs to an act of greedy love that produces, as a result, a greedy gluttonous carnivore despite the creature being a piece of wood.\n\nOn the other hand, Svankmajer depicts with great insight the sins of parenthood in our modern world, in which children are spoiled rotten, to whom everything is allowed, any bad act excused, and nothing denied.\n\nThe movie also depicts with great humor and realism the social dynamics of small groups in blocks of apartments and neighborhoods, paced by gossip, the power of appearances, the help and support neighbors give to each other, the enmities and tensions existing amongst them, the human types that populate them, etc.\n\nThe role of food in this movie is also very interesting, as most human characters in the movie eat disgusting porridge-ish meals, despite them fancying meat, while Otesanek is the only one eating meat all the time! The Actors are all great and charming in their respective roles. Veronika Zilková plays with great conviction the non-easy to play barren wife Bozena, while Jan Hartl plays with sweetness her doubtful and confused husband Karel. Also terrific are the actors playing the good-hearted neighbors: Kristina Adamcová as the incisive rebel child Alzbetka -who is also the catalyst of the story-, Jaroslava Kretschmerová as Alzbetka&apos;s sensible Mother, Pavel Nový as Alzbetka&apos;s typical working-class male Father, and Dagmar Stríbrná as the patient caretaker.\n\nThe stop-motion animation of Otesanek is delightfully awkward, especially when Otesanek is a baby, and the illustrations by Svankmajer&apos;s wife for the original tale in the book Alzbetka is reading are beautifully colorful and artistic. They are a contrast to the ugly-looking 70-80s colors and lighting with which Svankmejer shot the movie. Also delightful are the episodes involving the old spectacled neighbor and Alzbetka, which are really naughty.\n\nOn the negative side, beyond the ugly film and colors used, the movie is too long and its pace too slow at times.\n\nA grotesque mesmerizing humorous adult tale with a great story, terrific performances, and very interesting themes. This is not a film for lazy watchers, though.",

It features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the riots, to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of. I react emotionally when I see this, since I just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the riots but also after the riots.\n\nI hope as many as possible gets to see this movie, as it really gets your mind thinking: Is this possible?

This has a lot to do with the fact that whenever trains fail or succeed in carrying out their tasks of moving passengers from one place to another, it is not only them which fail or succeed as machines as the blame is attributed to a whole range of persons whose jobs are related to trains. It is precisely keeping this thing in mind that Polish director Andrzej Munk set out to direct &quot;Czlowiek Na Torze&quot;, a film about the lives of Polish railway workers. His film questions the role of a dead railway worker who went much too far in the course of his job before after having been being fired by the authorities. This film was made possible with the help of Polish Railway employees who are shown to wisely tackle differences at work place. The film begins with a nicely shot sequence of a train driven by a steam engine. It is worth mentioning that the camera has been placed so meticulously that one could see the actual train chugging marvelously on the tracks. The film is replete with nicely shot scenes of this kind which capture each moment of what it is being in a situation related to trains.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an underrated film that has received reviews too dismissing, I feel. I agree with the above reviewer on some of its shortcomings, but would also point out that there is a very nice tension set up between Gene Tierney and Lynn Bari throughout most of the story  which certainly had me watch it through to the very end. Contrary to other opinions, Tierney fans will not be disappointed here, although I agree she doesn&apos;t truly shine as in some others; and Lynn Bari is at her best and definitely makes us wish she had been given more prominent parts. Some feel that Bari actually makes this movie, but this may be going too far. Moreover, I don&apos;t believe China Girl was ever intended as a war movie per se, rather a drama. The war-scene ending just happens to be the bitter twist that closes what is essentially a war-time drama between a guy and two gals  it&apos;s no more complex than that.\n\nAlso, the camera is no slouch either, in this movie. It has excellent shots in the hotel rooms where much of the action takes place, giving it a somewhat noir feel that definitely generates an overall stylish period polish that is in synch with the true noirs of the period. If you like this style, as I do, China Girl is worth seeking out. One can only hope that it will eventually become part of a Tierny Collection. I&apos;m certainly keeping my fingers crossed!",

      "reviewBody": "Early effort of producer Robert Radnitz (SOUNDER, WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS) is distinguished by colorful location photography (in the Netherlands), fine acting and an uncondescending script.\n\nDavid Ladd (son of Alan) gives a believable, unmannered performance as the orphan boy with artistic longings, and veteran Donald Crisp shines, as always, as his loving grandfather.  Character actor Theodore Bikel is also an asset, playing the prickly artist who somewhat reluctantly takes the boy under his wing.  \n\nDog-lovers should note that the title canine&apos;s role in this story is important yet not central, serving mainly to set the plot in motion.  But it&apos;s a lovable pooch nonetheless, and goes through its paces with perfect doggish realism, a tribute to its skilled handlers and a refreshing change of pace from such modern CGI manipulations as SNOW DOGS.\n\nThis film is unflinching in its portrayal of what can be a harsh and uncaring world, and younger and/or sensitive children may find it tough going before the ultimately happy ending.  My daughter saw this when she was 8; two-thirds of the way into it she was weeping openly and was only somewhat mollified by the heart-warming conclusion.  Recommended for 10 and up.",

      "reviewBody": "For about half its length, ANNABEL CHONG is a bright, light, unexpected, vibrant, witty documentary.  Annabel Chong is Grace Quek, a Singapore-raised English anthropology student at the University of South California, who became a porn actress after an unenlightened feminist tutorial, as an expression of sexual freedom.  She became famous in 1995 when she broke the world record for sleeping with the most men (251 in ten hours), and became a fixture on programmes like THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW.\n\nGrace herself is a very likeable, seemingly together young woman, with the teeth of Goldie and the accent of Jane Seymour, who decides to become a &apos;stud&apos; to critique masculinity.  She seems in complete control of her career and her image, and, as her world record is revealed straight away, there is no conventionally contrived documentary &apos;success&apos;.\n\nThe film is sharply funny as it explores the strangely haphazard and hugely lucrative pornography industry.  Many of its denizens, with amusingly childishly suggestive names, find Annabel&apos;s antics distasteful and degrading, confirming the image of sleaze the constant display of computers are trying to conceal.  The marketing men are either aging, pony-tailed relics who are easy to laugh at, or the younger, can&apos;t-quite-believe-their-luck jocks who can&apos;t stop giggling.\n\nUnfortunately things become more sinister as the pressure begins to tell on Annabel.  She is quite clearly not in control, and the film constantly undermines her claims to independence, as she dances for a bunch of slavering perverts.  These latter don&apos;t care what incomprehensible post-structuralist jargon comes out of her mouth, as long as she delivers the goods.  In fact, this feminist liberation goes beyond their wildest dreams - a woman who is actually looking to them for it.\n\nThis we might have expected, but more repulsive revelations begin to leak out.  Not only do we assume that she is tacitly forced into the event by leeches who can see a sucker from a mile off, but she isn&apos;t paid, she is quickly abandoned for an even more photogenic cash-cow, and most horrific of all, we discover that the health and safety standards for the event were criminally lax.\n\nThis becomes a deeply and properly misanthropic film in which, I think, the filmmakers, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, collude.  Produced and directed by men, the film is formally weighted against Annabel.  The more images and &apos;reality&apos; contradict Annabel, the less we listen to her voice, the more we listen to others, squeezing her out.  Music (for instance the repetition of &apos;Amazing Grace&apos;) is used to ironise Annabel, and there are a number of occasions when the film&apos;s ethics are seriously in question, and not just the obvious contrivances of many scenes.  \n\nLittle &apos;narratives&apos; are slipped into the story (eg does Annabel have AIDS?). In one, she hasn&apos;t yet told her mother, and the film uses this very private and damaging dilemma to generate suspense.  Frequently, Annabel doesn&apos;t seem to be in control, and yet the filmmakers watch her slashing her wrists so they can offer a neat thesis on different penetrations of the body.  The film is careful to record the different groups of men who use and belittle Annabel (TV shows, the porn industry, her old teachers, Cambridge students etc.), but don&apos;t seem to notice their own culpability. \n\n The film becomes seriously depressing , and while it is quite right to give an audience lured by the sensationalist title a shock, a play with gender identity, a critique of filmmaking itself, the filmmakers seem to have crossed a line, where they have become as exploitative as the porn producers.  In one scene they revisit the site of a rape; in another they gang up with us and an informed teacher on an unknowing Annabel.  The frequent shots from outside looking in invoke a voyeuristic model, and maybe the documentary is intensely self-aware, but the increasingly moralistic drive is only at the expense of Annabel Chong.",

      "reviewBody": "Bad Acting, Bad directing. The cinematography is really haphazardly done with no consistent linkage from one scene to the next. The acting is extremely fake for all the actors. I reckon the only good acting done was the bloody tongue wiggling on the floor. There is definitely no flow in this movie. Furthermore, within the first 5 minutes of the movie, one will definitely know that the movie has been done on the cheap. With all this negativity, I have to say that the leading actress who is Jacob&apos;s wife is extremely good looking and if I have to say so..she doesn&apos;t seem to fit the role as an actress. She seems more like a model who&apos;s confused. Jacob the lead actor does a disgusting job especially when shown tied up to the bed. His acting seems extremely fake. I don&apos;t recommend watching this movie unless you&apos;ve seen all the movies in this world and are bored stiff.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the finest films ever made. Some say not as good as the first; some also say a good movie, but an unnecessary remake; I say it is even better than the first (that is saying A LOT) and completely necessary. \n\nThe first &apos;The French Connection&apos; was a classic of its time; completely deserving of its many awards; and masterfully directed demonstrating both the typical life of NYC Narcotics cops and the many losses which come with the war on drugs, ultimately questioning the utility of the war at all. It was much more &apos;story-telling&apos; based and much slower than its sequel &apos;French Connection II.&apos; In this movie, Gene Hackman excels even further, and the move shifts from an excellent telling of a non fiction story to a dark, gritty character study of our anti hero &apos;Popeye.&apos; \n\nIn a sense, the sequel is necessary because it completes the character development of Popeye and it shows how much he is willing to lose in his desperate pursuit of Charnier. The fiction element of the sequel allowed for the opportunity to make it conclude in style and the movie was otherwise well balanced as either entertaining or difficult to watch at times due to its graphic depiction of drug use, which is a balance very difficult to strike effectively. \n\nThe chemistry between Popeye and the French detective was wonderful. The acting is super superb. The movie is essentially flawless, and it adds so much to the first movie by the very nature of engaging in an in depth study of Popeye. It is one of the best crime dramas ever made, and it is disappointing to see that it has not received as much attention by awards critics or the public in general.\n\nMaybe it is too difficult to watch for some, or maybe it is too &apos;different&apos; to its predecessor and it causes too much dismay. However, for me, it was completely unique, and executed with perfection, and could not have been a better fit to a fiction ending to a non fiction story! In my opinion, &apos;The French Connection&apos; and &apos;French Connection II&apos; together, as one, make for one of the most memorable Hollywoodised detective films of all time. No matter how much time passes or how old it gets, they will always be remembered as classics, each for their own reasons, for me.",

But we didn&apos;t stop 9/11.\n\nMaybe what needs to change is the way we see the world, whether we&apos;re 6, or 86. This is a movie for all to see, especially children. This is a movie that will bring us together, and instruct us about the dangers of not only technology, but also the sometimes destructiveness of human nature."

A further shock follows when he and his brother Erik discover her apartment, which is filthy and full to bursting with junk. It takes the brothers an entire month to clean out the place. Among the chaos, they find films going back to the 1930s, photos and other memorabilia. Gradually they piece together a strange and unique family saga, in which baronesses and counts, Latin Lovers and Nazi officers play a role, and even the young Kofi Annan makes an appearance. A fast-paced and surprisingly funny story about an unusual legacy.",

In fact, the film tends to make more fun of itself than &apos;gross-out&apos; gags, of which there are hardly any.\n\nThe scene where the lead character has hard-fought fantasy in algebra class is absolutely hilarious. The film features one of the brothers from Malcom in the Middle who adds to the humour, especially when the lads watch an &quot;alternate&apos; video by mistake as a prelude to their party.\n\nWhy not spend a few dollars renting this movie overnight. As an unpretentious fluff piece it is 5 stars."

The characters are pretty well developed and very individual, which is very important for a fairytale. It even has a nice atmosphere and is cinematically pretty well done. But I have a problem with this movie, and that is the plot. The plot is merely there, it&apos;s more like some situations put together with a very thin red line to follow and sometimes no red line following at all, which had quite the potential to bore me at some part at let me search subconsciously for some distraction. In the end, I can&apos;t really tell what happened. But I can say that it had amusing parts and I didn&apos;t turn this movie off so it wasn&apos;t that bad at all but not something I&apos;d suggest anyone to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "The Flame of New Orleans (1941) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nClaire Ledeux (Marlene Dietrich) is the most beautiful and most wanted woman in New Orleans. She can pretty much have her pick of any man and sure enough there are two of them wanting her. One is a successful and rich businessman (Roland Young) who could offer her anything. The other is a sea captain (Bruce Cabot) with plenty to offer.\n\nThe &quot;flame&quot; had clearly ran out by the time this movie was made. If you&apos;ve never seen a Dietrich movie then you&apos;ll probably enjoy this one slightly more but if you&apos;ve seen many of her films then you&apos;re going to notice this plot from pretty half a dozen earlier films. Once again we get a pretty standard plot that has Dietrich looking beautiful, seducing two men and of course she also gets a song to sing.\n\nThe biggest problem with THE FLAME OF NEW ORLEANS is the fact that there&apos;s just nothing here that we haven&apos;t already seen before. This certainly gives the film a very dull flavor because there&apos;s just nothing here to keep us overly amused and especially when you consider that the Dietrich-Cabot-Young love triangle isn&apos;t nearly the best we&apos;ve seen from the previous films. All three cast members certainly do a good job with their performances but when there&apos;s no much of a story there&apos;s just so much you can do.\n\nDirector Rene Clair adds a little style to the picture but there&apos;s just nothing overly special here."

I have to admit that I was not disappointed in the least with what I saw. The movie had a good solid story of a middle-aged man dealing with both supporting his family and keeping his job (bordering on a mid-life crisis), and a young man dealing with a new job, being alone, and finding what he actually wants to do with the rest of his life. Sure, it sounds like a pretty typical &quot;finding yourself&quot; movie, but the characters develop the plot into something special. Topher Grace was excellent in this film. I found him very charming and believable, and he was sincere in his role. However, Dennis Quaid was really wonderful. His character was likable, and you found yourself routing for him throughout. His interactions with his family were endearing, and his relationship with his daughter Alex (Scarlett Johanssen) reminded me of my own father. I highly recommend this movie. 4/5",

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t commented on a film here for three years, but now I&apos;ve returned to warn you for this piece of crap. It baffles me that people say Godzilla 1998 is the worst film they ever saw. They obviously never saw this one. I can&apos;t believe some people actually like this and there is a DVD of this film.\n\nI never expected a good movie, but sometimes cheap cheesy sf-films can be enjoyable. But this flick sucks big time. The general that gives Major Kints (Sal Landi) his orders has his office in a shed. The marines are plain stupid. The alien isn&apos;t scary or impressive at all. The explosions aren&apos;t even real.\n\nThere are many continuity errors. Backpacks and guns appearing and disappearing. An alien with small fragile hands that seems to have medical instruments to dissect his victims. On broad daylight, you can see the alien in a dark background. Kint and Fetterman (Andrew Divoff) fight on a boat and seem to be the only two people on the rather large looking ship. And after 40 years, the alien decides to take off and breaks his ship out of the concrete bunker he was trapped in. Doh.\n\nHere&apos;s another example of the bad script: When everybody is walking towards a bunker to hide, private Banta stops for a moment because the batteries of her flashlight are dead. She&apos;s left behind by the other soldiers and soon she&apos;s stuck in the alien&apos;s slime web. Kint wants to look for her but private O&apos;Reilly thinks she&apos;s dead because she stopped screaming. This all happens in the dark, and when it&apos;s daytime again, the alien comes to dissect Banta. The following night Kint decides to look for Banta after all, and when it&apos;s daylight again O&apos; Reilly (with backpack) joins him. They look and look, but can&apos;t seem to find her. Luckily the Major climbs in a tree and spots the alien still dissecting Banta. He aims (with a sniperrifle he didn&apos;t bring) for the alien but misses and then ends Banta&apos;s misery by shooting her. Then they go back to the bunker, however Kint no longer has the rifle and O&apos; Reilly no longer has his backpack. And this is just a small sample of the stupidity of this film.\n\nWhen the remaining people are building a raft, two of them, O&apos; Reilly and Watkins (Karen Moncrieff) go for a swim. However not in the brook where they are building the raft, but they walk a mile to the beach. I was hoping that the woman would show her breasts but alas, nudity is not an option in this flick.\n\nbelieve me, this movie stinks. It&apos;s crap. It&apos;s a waste of celluloid. With worthless movies like this, it&apos;s uncanny that people are bashing fun movies like Anaconda or Godzilla 98. Hell, even Deep Star Six is even  better than this junk. I&apos;d rather watch the dumb Tammy and the T-rex again than Xtro 3 (at least Tammy had a nice striptease in the end).\n\nDon&apos;t buy, rent or watch this one (unless you want to spot all the goofs)."

Eddi Arent is extremely annoying as a West German tourist, he reminded me a lot of the idiot who is made fun of by Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Charade&quot;. That&apos;s how the European neighbors saw the annoying Teutons!\n\nCatherine Schell (later the sister-in-law of world star Hildegard Knef) and the ladylike Margot Trooger, who made a much more impression as the &quot;Ringer&quot;&apos;s wife, also act disappointingly.\n\nUltimately, it&apos;s a matter of taste: for me, the film is a trivial, run-of-the-mill crime thriller; I miss the silly, scary atmosphere of the other West German Edgar Wallace films.",

No new stuff in this one, sounds &quot;dejà vu&quot;, though the budget to crashing things is considerable bigger. Only a few gags are worth (Futbol Club Barcelona one is wonderful!), and very-very bad taste in the initial and final scenes. Santiago, how could you do that to us? Thanks for showing us cameos of John Landis, Oliver Stone and Guillermo del Toro (though I don&apos;t remember having seen Guillermo there). I still am a Santiago fan, and I truly believe he can do a lot, but looks like Torrente&apos;s epoch is over. Come on, surprise us again!",

      "reviewBody": "Many films fall into that &apos;so-bad-they&apos;re-good&apos; category.  The guys at Troma have even made it a revered art form.  But Troma has yet to match &quot;Never Too Young to Die.&quot;  Without realising it, the filmmakers have achieved the ultimate tacky 80&apos;s action movie.  It has just a perfect balance of tacky 80&apos;s acting (with &quot;Jessie&quot; from &quot;Full House,&quot; Gene Simmons from KISS, and Vanity--what ever happened to her?), tacky 80&apos;s action, tacky 80&apos;s music, and tacky 80&apos;s production design.  The plot is the most convoluted mess I&apos;ve ever seen.  That is to say that there really is a plot, but you find yourself smacking your forehead repeatedly in disbelief as the writers juggle tacky 80&apos;s clichés, predictable plot turns, and convenient situations that no one would ever buy.  And sometimes, it just doesn&apos;t make any sense at all.  But when all is said and done, the final product is a movie that is just delightfully crappy.  My suggestion: rent this movie with some friends and some booze, and have a rollicking good time bashing this movie.  I give it a 0 for its poor quality and a 10 for its &quot;entertainment&quot; value.  Total score: 5"

If you are a fan of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; you should see this because Oliver O&apos;Grady is just as chilling as Hannibal Lecter -- more so because he is real. Filmmaker Amy Berg did a news piece on O&apos;Grady, a Catholic priest who raped dozens -- possibly hundreds -- of children in California. On a whim, she called him in his exile in Ireland and got him to agree to an extensive three day interview. It is a confession unlike any other.\n\nOn one level, Deliver Us From Evil is a righteous indictment of the Catholic Church: its inaction, its enabling, its bureaucracy, its male-dominated backwardness.\n\nAt the same time, the film is a profile of some incredibly decent people: Catholic parents and children who were victims in this rampage. Their character is inspiring -- their pain is as raw as anything you will ever see on film.\n\nFinally, it&apos;s the study about the way a psychopath can play every human emotion to his own advantage.\n\nThere is Hell to pay for this man&apos;s sins. And some victims are living that hell every day.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve read the negative reviews in here and am perplexed at the vitriol directed at this film.  &quot;Meteor&quot; is, admittedly, a flawed movie, but still one with many strengths that deserve attention.\n\nFirstly, it was made in 1979, so the effects are not going to be as stellar as they were in the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s.  And even then, some of those effects still hold up quite well to movies produced today.  The modeling work, especially of the orbiting Hercules and Peter the Great nuclear missile platforms, is extremely impressive.  The meteor itself is a big, ugly, and rather scary chunk of scarred rock, reminiscent of the Texas-sized shard in &quot;Armageddon&quot;.  Yes, some of the effects DO look cheesy (the avalanche being the most frequently cited example), but others are quite striking.  At worst, &quot;Meteor&quot;&apos;s effects are extremely uneven, but certainly not completely junkable.\n\nSecondly, unlike &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;, the film focuses on the multitude of hurdles that have to be overcome in order to combat the threat. Personal, politicial, and scientific obstacles are given due screentime, which serves to advance the story rather than bogging it down.\n\nThirdly, &quot;Meteor&quot; is a far more globalized film, as it pulls together Russian, English, and even Chinese characters into the story.  The attempt to track the rock and derive a viable solution to knock it out of its Earth-based trajectory is not solely an American one, but instead a closely coordinated international effort.  Indeed, even the U.N. is (briefly) featured.\n\nFourthly, the film doesn&apos;t get mired in the &apos;human element&apos; (as what happened in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;).  &quot;Meteor&quot; is non-tangential in that it STICKS TO THE STORY, which is the main interest of the viewer (at least, for me).  Yes, there is the attraction between Connery and Wood&apos;s characters, but it&apos;s generally unobtrusive and the screentime limited.\n\nFifth, Laurence Rosenthal&apos;s score is great!  Its boldness reminds me of Poledouris&apos; legendary score for &quot;Conan:  The Barbarian&quot;.  It effectively captures both the &apos;feel&apos; of space and the direness and immediacy of the situations portrayed.\n\nFinally, I emjoyed the acting.  Connery, Keith, Malden, and Fonda turn in sincere performances (especially Malden).  &quot;Meteor&quot; is an ensemble production in the tradition of Irwin Allen&apos;s best disaster productions.\n\nDon&apos;t let the naysayers in here turn you off from this underrated gem.  If &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot; left you wanting, give &quot;Meteor&quot; a try. Sure, it may not be as polished as those two productions, but it has more going for it than you might think."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ballada o soldate&quot; has one of the most poignant sequences of all war movies:when the mother holds only for a few minutes, her dear boy in her arms,it&apos;s impossible to hold back your tears .I saw the movie for the first time thirty years ago and I have never forgotten it.Far from politics ,&quot;ballada o soldate&quot; is an universal poem,enhanced by a magnificent grandiose score,which enhances the simple beauty of the pictures,climaxing on a symphony for the finale.\n\nAliocha&apos;s furlough is so short (48 hours) and it&apos;s such a long way to his dear home.His journey becomes an odyssey ,but ,unlike Ulysses,his happiness will be short-lived.He and the girl form one of the most touching,lovable and innocent couple you will see on a screen.Their simple joys ,particularly when they share the soldier&apos;s food,or when they meet again in the desert station,are the ones which make a life worthwhile,even in the hell which surrounds them.\n\nSometimes recalling Sirk&apos;s &quot; a time to love and a time to die&quot;(1958)from Erich Maria Remarque ,the great German pacifist writer,with which it shares the same disgust of war (&quot;I wanted to film a subject which could condemn war&quot;,the director said),&quot;ballada o soldato&quot; is one of these rare movies that will reward you each time you watch it.",

The players are also unknowns or near unknowns. However it&apos;s such an early space movie that it&apos;s historically fascinating.\n\nThe noted Sci Fi writer Richard Heinlein wrote the script. (He&apos;s more famous for Starship Troopers.) The movie attempts to portray space in a realistic way. Of course the technology looks thoroughly ridiculous to us now but this was done 60 years ago.\n\nSocially it was of interest because of the relative equality between women and men. Equality between the sexes was a theme in Heinlein, and amazingly it made it into this very early movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Lunopolis is a superior and riveting sci-fi exploration into the docu- style which was soundly poured all over the popular film scene by The Blair Witch Project, and since carried on many times since. But, The Witch Project has absolutely nothing on Lunopolis. This film both pulls you wonderfully and helplessly in, yet also introduces a few mind bending quantum concepts (multi-verses, time travel, even what we call ghosts) into a gaping spectator style film perfect for the somewhat jaded elder infoweb generation. The story involves the crew who in their relentless curiosity, unlikely find an object which may alter space, time, and perhaps all of history. Still, this discovery becomes almost secondary to their genuine fear, insatiable childlike need to know, and pervasive want to bail out on the whole thing and save their asses after they realize that they are not alone. They do not want to believe, yet they are forced to run when pursued by a largely ineffective sorta Mormon-esque Scientologist Lunarian hit men squad (and why so merely verbally menacing? are they there to just push them forward?). They miraculously escape again and again. That they are spared does not detract from the inevitability of their quest. They meet strangely learned people, but they remain shrouded and not overly helpful. Thankfully, no cinematic, physics or sci-fi theoretical concept is slathered in sugar and dragged excessively across the stymied crew&apos;s faces too greatly, and the pacing is quite relentlessly perfect. It&apos;s an excellent film to gape slackjawed at, be a little wowed at, and yet still believe in it&apos;s possibility. X Files fans might definitely like this. The fourth wall, being broken by the nature of the film in the first place, never tires, nor is burdened by any overly prescient character narration. It&apos;s a great watch, a late night movie to enjoy.",

The trouble with films about politics is that it&apos;s tempting for them to drag out the usual stereotypes (&quot;conservative&quot; = corrupt, &quot;left-wing&quot; = idealistic and naive), but this film avoids that.  Instead it concentrates on the daily grind of the election campaign, with the candidate trying to hand out his campaign leaflets and free biro to passers-by who aren&apos;t interested, having to fill the base of a stand in a public toilet to stop it blowing over in the wind, and so on.  It would be unfair to comment on Herr Wichmann himself, since he is a real person, but overall I found the film surprisingly optimistic about German politics. True, there are no great ideals floating around, but on the other hand the sort of sleaze and corruption we normally associate with politicians is absent. Perhaps the best scene is when Herr Wichmann and three of his rivals are challenged to design a common campaign poster, and they look like four quite normal and nice people."

      "reviewBody": "I truly think if this film had come out earlier it would today be thought of as a better film. After all, it&apos;s FAR better than its current rating of 6.8. That&apos;s because 1972 was the same year that &quot;The Godfather&quot; debuted and the utter greatness of &quot;The Godfather&quot; probably overwhelmed &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot;---as both touch on very similar subject matter. The main difference is that &quot;The Godfather&quot; was based fictionalized characters and had a true elegance about the film. &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot; in contrast was a much more straight forward story based on real mob figures--and it&apos;s a dandy film.\n\nThe film begins in the early 1960s. Mobster Joseph Valachi is in prison and multiple attempts are made on his life. It seems that someone in the organization has talked--and the mob of bosses, Genovese (Lino Ventura) believes it was Valachi. And, not surprisingly, a contract has been placed on Valachi&apos;s head. This has the unintended consequence of forcing Valachi to to authorities. Almost all the rest of the film consists Valachi giving his story to the government agent. What follows is a very long story about Valachi&apos;s earliest days in the mob (about 1930) up to the arrest that brought him to prison--and a bit beyond.\n\nThe story is helped a lot by the films&apos;s length--a little over two hours. You&apos;d need at least this much to tell such a long and complicated story. It also helps that Charles Bronson is given some excellent support. Among the many wonderful actors, one really surprised me--Lino Ventura. I&apos;ve seen him in many French films (mostly Pierre Melville productions) and have LOVED his acting--he plays a great mobster--cold and tough. I never realized that he spoke English so well--everything I&apos;ve seen him in up until now has been in French. Here, he very credibly plays an Italian-American! The script also was quite good. While not quite as human and interesting as &quot;The Godfather&quot;, it sure was good...very, very good.\n\nThere&apos;s almost nothing negative I could say about the film other than very minor things. Bronson was too old for this role. When the film began he was supposed to be 27--but looked about twice that. Also, a few times anachronistic elements somehow made their way in--such as cars that were from the wrong time period. But, as I said, this is all very minor.Aside from this, a top quality production that deserves more recognition. Gritty, exciting and fascinating as well.\n\nBy the way, although IMDb lists the movie as being rated PG, the version I saw was way too bloody and filled with nudity to have been rated PG. The lesbian scene along would have merited a rating of R. Perhaps this was a director&apos;s cut or perhaps it was not rated PG or perhaps there were just multiple versions.",

      "reviewBody": "STELLA MARIS has got to be one of the great silent films. Superstar Mary Pickford plays two roles in this seemingly sentimental tale (but it&apos;s not). She plays the lovely but crippled Stella Maris, whose family works hard to hide the ugliness of life from. She is shielded from the world because she is crippled. But of course her family doesn&apos;t do her any real favors. Eventually Stella is able to walk, and she discovers the horrors of war and crime and poverty by herself.\n\nPickford also plays Unity Blake, a homely and misshapen orphan who is taken from the orphanage by a cruel and drunken woman (Marcia Manon) who eventually beats her and goes to jail. Sent back to the orphanage, Unity is &quot;hired&quot; by the cruel woman&apos;s husband (Conway Tearle), but he is enamored of beautiful Stella Maris.\n\nPickford is just plain brilliant in playing these two women (and yes they share a few scenes together). Stella is pretty much standard fare for Pickford: golden curls, white frilly dresses, etc. Unity is a marvel of invention with her crooked body, crooked smile, and long dark hair. It&apos;s hard to believe this is Mary Pickford.\n\nThe film itself uses the iris shot beautifully to show what characters are thinking. The fade outs are well done. The scenes where the two Pickford characters appear together are flawless. Of special note is a gorgeous shot of Unity approaching the camera for a closeup, but in the end only her eyes show up in a deep purple tinted scene.\n\nThe ending is haunting. Superb work."

      "reviewBody": "The tale of paratroopers who disappear, literally, into thin air, this film is an odd watch forty years later. It&apos;s primary interest lies more in what it says about the time, than the film itself.\n\nReleased in 1969 three influences loom large.The year that Man first landed on the moon it reflects a fascination with, and fear of, what might lie in outer space. Militarily we were also in the midst of the Cold War when anything unexplained, and potentially evil, automatically raised the question of Communist involvement. And finally James Bond was the dominant screen character, and his shadow falls long here in more senses than one.\n\nVeteran, square jawed character Patrck Allen, bulldozes his way through the role of an expert,Bob Megan, called in to solve the awkward problem of disappearing parachutists. One extraordinary scene speaks volumes for the Bond &quot;character&quot; and perceptions of women at the time. Megan chances upon a scantily clad beauty enjoying enjoying a solitary moment taking in the evening and then makes advances on her which vacillate between sexual assault and rape. No sooner is he introduced to a shapely scientist in a pencil skirt than she too is subjected to his clumsy male machismo which in the 21st century looks appalling.Of course both women come back for more. When he IS offered sex on a plate by the blousey, but ageing, hotel owner he rebuffs her to reinforce yet another sexual stereotype, the ageing temptress who can&apos;t get it because she has had it.\n\nThe Bond theme is further explored by the presence of Sean Connery&apos;s brother Neil, as Megans sidekick John Radford, in one of only two screen performances. Bearing a strong resemblance to Sean, his acting talents are strait jacketed by a preposterous script.\n\nA dreadful ending combines the worst of &quot;Dr Who&quot; and &quot;The Champions&quot;, suggesting that a 30 minute running time, rather than three times that, would have suited all concerned somewhat better. A hopeless film, but a fascinating sixties curiosity.",

Mama spends her day plowing a sand dune (up and down) by pulling a wooden contraption built for the purpose. The twins are lazy, mischief-makers who steal, play pranks on everybody and eat everything in sight. When they go they get directions from talking trees, a donkey, a couple of pelicans and the residents of a kingdom where everybody is a hunchback. Special effects are primitive, in a high-school drama class sort of way and are charming, with flashes of hilarity like when the sun comes up, the babies start yelling and the sun goes back down to avoid the noise. The kids are bug-cute, but have the last laugh. Lech is the current President of Poland (was mayor of Warsaw) and his brother is the President of his Political Party. They are 57 years old, married and not at all cute.",

It&apos;s set in the mid 18th century during the French and Indian War, on what was the frontier then. It can be seen as an adventure movie, although mostly it&apos;s a war film. It&apos;s also a character study of Major Robert Rogers, very well interpreted by Spencer Tracy, commander of Rogers&apos; Rangers, an American military company of rangers attached to the British Army (this was of course before the War of independence).\n\nThe movie is harsh in its military objective (destroying an hostile Indian village) as in its depiction of the epic journey to get there and to get back. And its mostly about the journey, where Rogers pushes his men on a grueling trip through the wilderness, on boats and on foot, through sheer grit and strength of character.\n\nSome reviewers have complained of &quot;too much walking in the woods&quot;, but that&apos;s the point of the movie, showing how these men pushed themselves through such a harsh journey.\n\nIt&apos;s filmed in technicolor, and that&apos;s a good thing, because this movie needs a good cinematography. The cinematography we get is not perhaps breathtaking, but it&apos;s good enough to do the trick and get us into the story.\n\nOne complaint I have is that the actors, while dirty and disheveled through all the hardships, never really look like they are starving. Also, the actual battle, while not the climax of the movie, was not done that well, at least if we judge it by modern standards. But it doesn&apos;t really matter, because as I said what matters here is the journey and the determination to survive, and that is well depicted.\n\nAn intense, harsh, war movie made in 1940 for a nation that was about to get into the biggest war.\n\nCuriously, despite the title, it has nothing to do with searching for the Northern Passage. That was supposed to come in the second part that was never filmed. In fact, in the credits it&apos;s called chapter I."

      "name": "Bulgarian Romance Offers Insights on 60s Political, Relationship Attitudes",
      "reviewBody": "The novelty of this romantic drama is that it was made in Bulgaria in the mid-Sixties. In most other respects it is a familiar, arty rumination on the nostalgia of lost love. A pair of ex-lovers, who have sacrificed personal happiness to public duty, accidentally meet after a 17-year separation. Both are now married and involved in their careers. A drive to Sofia, the capital, provides an interesting glimpse of the barren the Bulgarian countryside of the time and triggers off flashbacks of their student romance. A number of questions arise during their meeting and reminisces of the past. Why did they ever separate? What makes their love impossible? The film is obliged to answer not these questions, but more insightfully the film goes as far as questioning their idealistic sacrifice, which for the era makes for an interesting comment on the changing Communist thought of the day. The film was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival where it won awards.",

      "reviewBody": "The Road A Year Long was a labor of love for leftist Italian auteur Giuseppe De Santis, who prepared his epic, about peasants building a mountain road, for four years without getting any funding in his own country, only to finally receive support from the socialist state of Tito&apos;s Yugoslavia. It is a worthy celebration of collective effort: how a bold plan by an individual worker to help the economy of a depressed isolated area turns into a communal achievement despite at first the opposition of some comrades and for even longer the refusal of the town authorities (the mayor, the schoolteacher, the priest) to support and pay for the project. The workers are even imprisoned several times to obstruct the effort, though a daring refusal by the women to participate in church services and keep their children in school helps turn the tide, followed by a change of heart from the teacher who goes to listen to the workers and joins them. The film has an epic sweep of almost 2 and a half hours which is elaborated through dramatic use of long takes and the Scope format. De Santis, however, cannot resist an interest in the erotic and romantic complications of the characters, as he showed early in his career with Bitter Rice; this aspect of the film does add a specific human dimension to individual members of the collective but pulls the film at times into melodrama and stretches out the tension of the basic story more than it might need to.",

The company that owns the horse wants to keep it quiet and then wants to send in the police. Fonda tracks him down and joins up with him so she can get a bigger story and of course, they have to fall in love. This movie seems to be a cross between It Happened One Night and Lonely Are The Brave. This was directed by Sydney Pollock who has worked with Redford several times before and also with Fonda.",

Great actors appear in the movie including Emilio &quot;indio&quot; Fernandez and the always enigmatic Irma Serrano who is already celebrity of its own. This film passed unnoticed in Mexico, where I saw it. In part thanks to the lousy distribution system of that time, which used to privilege the foreign movies. Nowdays there are no longer Mexican movies so the distributors no longer have the concern of programming Mexican movies. I personally believe the movie could had turn into a cult movie. It has a good plot, good intentions, interesting actors and low budget.",

This movie is not really a Christmas movie, it&apos;s more like a dark nasty movie that makes it more like a Halloween movie like the attic and cave parts and stuff Even when I was 9 year old little girl I didn&apos;t like this. The music was great but the whole movie was just bad. The script was like out of the brain thing that even a 2 and a half year old probably wouldn&apos;t really like. I wasn&apos;t interested in the storyline either and some parts of the cover is unfair and incorrect, Jill had on a blue and white dress in the cover, but in the movie, she has on a type of Cinderella dress? Although she does look kind of cute in it and all she is one of my top cutest cartoon characters, but hey? Some of the characters look uncute and ugly, but whatever the movie is just plain weak and boring.",

The storyline follows Jerry, leading a peaceful life until the Clause family brings Tom home. Their antics almost ruin Christmas, prompting them to team up to clean up their mess and ensure Santa can spread happiness as usual.\n\nDirected by Darrell Van Citters (Puss and Boots: A Furry Tail) and featuring the voices of Mark Hamill (Star Wars), Edie McClurg (Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off), and Katherine Soucie (Rugrats).\n\nWhile the animation took some time to grow on me, it&apos;s not my favorite for a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The voices are well-selected and suit the characters. The storyline is straightforward for the series, with enjoyable cameo characters. The ending is predictable but fitting.\n\nIn conclusion, it may not be the greatest Tom and Jerry cartoon, but it&apos;s worth a watch for fans of the series. I would score this a 5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",

      "reviewBody": "After eyeing this DVD off in the stores here in humid Japan, I finally plonked down the 4,000 or so yen, and got myself a copy. I wasn&apos;t sure what exactly I was getting myself into, but I was interested in finding out what the son of Osamu Tezuka, Makoto Tezuka, could do.\n\nWhat I witnessed, was a visually stunning film, drenched with atmosphere, held back only by underdeveloped main storyline, or should I say, climax. To say that the story was bad is inaccurate. After the quite intense opening, I quickly learned that this film was going to offer much much more than a typical murder mystery; gory as it may be in parts, the characters are so interesting and enjoyable to observe, I almost forgot about the grisly slaying that punctuate the film throughout.\n\nIn fact, when the climax did in fact arrive, it almost seemed to abrupt. Though the film clocks in at a little over two hours, so much time is spent soaking us beautiful imagery and tense atmosphere that the revelations in the final scenes seem out of the blue. Perhaps much more could have been done in regards to this, but seeing that this film had a rocky path to cinema release, perhaps some things were out of Mr Tezuka Junior&apos;s hands.\n\nAs stated above, the film is shot wonderfully, with great colour compositions and clever visual arrangements. The use of CGI in the film is minimal, but it is high enough in quality to fool those of more literal mindsets. The sound design is also worth a mention, as it really adds to the dark and foreboding mood of the rain drenched glistening imagery, and cramped and cluttered spaces.\n\nMuch has been said about Tezuka&apos;s references to other film makers in this film, particularly Hitchcock, but for what it&apos;s worth, it isn&apos;t a negative aspect. It isn&apos;t cheap, and I think it is a sincere attempt by the director to show us as film-goers just what makes him tick. The medical aspects of the story, perhaps echo Makoto&apos;s own upbringing, his father being a doctor originally, and I like to think that this film reflects his father&apos;s work much closer than people have assumed: an exploration of humanity, and human life.\n\nThat is what I see this film is, and the murders are just an enabler for the real dissections to take place.",

      "reviewBody": "This makes Luis Bunuel&apos;s Land Without Bread look like a perfect historic document. It&apos;s like a 12 year old looks at Africa and just makes up opinions about things after being told he&apos;s the smartest kid in the world. It&apos;s very entertaining and it&apos;s very useful. When they are not staging people and the sound is off this is amazing footage. They capture a lot of scenery of the time. Apparently at the time, if you could afford a camera and were willing to point it at something interesting, you could consider yourself a documentarian.\n\nI do realize he&apos;s telling bad jokes but it&apos;s the statements when he&apos;s being serious that make it so absurd.\n\nHe&apos;s making everything up as he narrates. He thinks a child&apos;s belly that indicates malnourishment is an indication of eating well. I fact checked a statement he made about a giraffe and it&apos;s completely incorrect. His statements about rhinos are also incorrect. Lions manes vary based on weather not because they get caught on bushes.\n\nHis knowledge of insects is the insects today do not act as well as insects in the Bible. Ungodly insects apparently. He provides an explanation for a practice of women in a tribe and it is wrong on every aspect. He states that nobody understands the behavior of impalas and then offers made-up information about the behavior of impalas.\n\nThese gentlemen are making a Borat style exposé about themselves. There&apos;s a scene where they obviously told two Africans to do something silly and then yell at them not to do it. This is a few white men discovering Africa by having dozens of black people do all their work. He points out that they use people from different tribes that can&apos;t talk to each other to make sure they don&apos;t all quit at the same time.\n\nLike Land Without Bread, this is a period piece that demonstrates a time when documentaries lacked journalistic standards. I do recognize some of this continues today and hence Borat has a lot of work to do.",

They inform people, like myself, of harms or dangers we were not aware of. A good documentarian will be that thorn in the side of governments, corporations, or otherwise as they dig and dig to uncover the hidden truth.\n\nJosh Fox wanted to do that here. He wanted to uncover the truth about hydraulic fracturing aka fracking for natural gas. Fracking is a process of drilling and using a high pressure chemical water mixture to release natural gas from where it&apos;s deposited in the Earth&apos;s crust. The energy companies claim that fracking has no negative impact upon water sources, about a few dozen people that Josh spoke to will say differently. He showed brown water, yellow water, and water that was flammable--yes! Flammable. All of the water came from the wells or drinking sources for regular folks.\n\nThe material of &quot;Gasland&quot; was excellent. The narration of the documentary was not. Josh&apos;s low, barely audible, monotone voice didn&apos;t exactly make one&apos;s ears perk up in attention. Perhaps he should&apos;ve borrowed from the Michael Moore style of lively comedic sarcasm to keep the audience awake. It&apos;s clear that Josh was a novice at this documentary thing, so I&apos;ll give him a pass.",

All logic and common sense goes out the window from the point they reach the ATM, and park 100 damn feet from it. LOL. The thought process these 3 main characters go through trying to escape one man, leads me to believe Poppa Smurf could have held them hostage at Disneyland. Successfully. Forever. \n\nEverything the ATM &quot;stalker villain&quot; does makes sense, because the 3 captives simply have zero.\n\nWatch this flick if you&apos;re a fan of &quot;b&quot; movies, or simply bored and want to pick it apart and cringe and a very bad script. Again, I think the writers and directors could have had something, if only they put in a bit more thought. Great idea, horrible execution.",

From this point of view the film is a failure. The character does not succeed to gain the sympathy of the viewer, and the complexity of the character is faked. Too much is badly written or un-explained in this movie. Even if action is not supposed to be in the focus, the reasons and details of the murder conspiracy  and the events around are left too much in the fuzzy zone. \n\nWhat remains is the well described atmosphere of Argentina, and the love of the character with tango dancing, and the beautiful Argentinian who introduces him to the secrets of tango. These are indeed the best moments of the film, but it is still to little to sustain the film, and left me with the feeling that they are strangely disconnected from the rest.\n\n An un-satisfactory film experience. 6/10 on my personal scale.",

I was hoping for another laughable Sci-Fi Original; some terrible script, some sad predictable plot, some poorly delivered lines, some poor acting.... but there&apos;s none of this. It&apos;s just &quot;blah&quot; all around.\n\nIn this film, you won&apos;t find much of a story. There really isn&apos;t a plot, just some very vague good-vs-evil. There&apos;s a lot of running around, and the whole movie is one big exercise in boredom. It doesn&apos;t even have the humor of a so-bad-it&apos;s-good flick.\n\nSo don&apos;t bother. Just go rent Carnosaur instead ;)",

      "reviewBody": "An insurance claims adjuster is sent to meet a man, his company believes is a con artist, engaged in insurance fraud.\n\nAnd during this meeting he makes a grisly discovery...the body of a young boy who has recently been hung.\n\nDespite the fact that he is not his actual son...the man has a very large insurance policy out on the boy&apos;s life. And he has the claim written up before his ashes are even spread.\n\nThis leads the insurance adjuster to suspect the man has murdered the boy...so he starts to investigate this man and his past.\n\nWith the insurance company refusing to pay out- before the police make a decision on the cause of death- the man becomes increasingly disgruntled...and starts to target the insurance adjuster.\n\nThey eventually pay him out, but the adjuster becomes worried his wife will be next...because he also has a large policy out on her, as well.\n\nHe feels particularly responsible, because, as a child, he witnessed his younger brother commit suicide...and still feels guilty for having failed to prevent it.\n\nSo he acts to intervene- warning the woman of what he suspects her husband&apos;s intentions are.\n\nBut a few days later, the couple is back...to collect on another claim...after the man has cut off both his arms.\n\nNow, the adjuster realizes...it was his psychopath wife the whole time.\n\nBut it&apos;s too late...his brother is dead, his girlfriend&apos;s dog has had it&apos;s head cut off, and his girlfriend has suddenly been kidnapped.\n\nObviously, this woman is not one to be trifled with.\n\nThis is a really engaging serial killer-slasher, from South Korea&apos;s Terra Shin. The insurance claims adjuster is such a lovable anti-hero...that you just don&apos;t expect him to be caught up in a gore-laden situation. But that is what gives this film that subtle touch of dark humour that makes it so damn enjoyable.\n\nRecommended.\n\n6.5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "As mama used to say, &quot;The extent of the nourishment you get from your  entertainment water is directly related to how deep your well of  expectations runs.&quot; I always thought mama was a bit too verbose in her  metaphorical philosophizing, but there&apos;s truth in them there words!  Thanks to Hollywood&apos;s constant desire to market films based on what  they feel they have to trick people into thinking they&apos;re about, some  audiences will likely go to see The Break-Up, ignore the insinuations  of the movie&apos;s title, and expect something cute and fluffy. As such,  the movie is unfairly saddled with expectations that it can&apos;t possibly  meet for no other reason than the simple fact that this is NOT a  conventional &quot;chick flick&quot; romantic comedy that will warm those little  heart cockles and send you floating out of the theater on a cotton  candy cloud.  After a chance meeting at a Cubs/White Sox baseball game, an &quot;opening  credit relationship photo montage&quot; creatively establishes that Jennifer  Aniston and Vince Vaughn are a couple. Just not for much longer. You  see, Jennifer is busy cooking for a family dinner. Vince&apos;s only  responsibility is to bring home 12 lemons so that she can create a  centerpiece for the dinner table. So what does he do? Brings home  three. Jen&apos;s understandably agitated.  Rather than dutifully go get the extra lemons, Vince tries to find  alternatives that will allow him to just sit on the couch and play  video games until everybody arrives. Perhaps use the lemons to flavor  the chicken since he tasted it and thought it was a little too spicy  anyway? Maybe place them in a glass and create a smaller centerpiece?  Yeah, it&apos;s fairly clear which three letters he puts in &quot;class.&quot;   This leads to his lack of desire to help with the dishes later that  evening. Oh, he&apos;ll help with them in the morning, but Jen really wants  them done tonight. Fifteen minutes of work won&apos;t kill the guy, right?  When Jen expresses her disdain for the lack of appreciation he shows  her, he goes into a character-exposing rant and declares his desire to  just be left alone. Jen&apos;s had enough and decides to grant him his wish.  Commence with the break-up and the emotional tug-of-war that carries  the majority of the movie.  This is where some audiences might get lost. Why? Probably because it  feels so real, and sometimes reality doesn&apos;t always sell. People still  love fairy tales, you know? The arguments and hard-feelings that slowly  develop will likely hit home with anybody who has gone through a break  up, and I have no doubt that many, if not most, guys will fill a little  discomfort when they see some of themselves in Vince.  The thing I appreciated the most is despite his penchant for being a  jerk, Vince isn&apos;t adorned with a black hat and presented to us for our  jeering. It&apos;s just the way he is. He likes doing things his way. He  treats his friends and brothers in the same manner, but they still love  the guy and like hanging out with him; he just needs to learn to accept  doing things he might not want to for the people he loves. He&apos;s likable  and funny enough that we root for him to learn the lesson.  Likewise, Jennifer isn&apos;t placed on a pedestal with a golden halo on her  head. Though she&apos;s the more sympathetic of the two, she still resorts  to playing dirty and isn&apos;t allowed to come off completely innocent.  Perhaps the character flaws won&apos;t play well with the &quot;give me  idealistic characters!&quot; crowd, but I found them refreshingly realistic.  The movie&apos;s focal point is the often volatile chemistry between Vince  and Jennifer, which I thought was great, but the supporting characters  are also very effective, albeit underused. Vince has some show-stealing  scenes with Jason Bateman and particularly one with Jon Favreau (and  his ever-increasing girth) that are so good that you can&apos;t help but be  disappointed that there aren&apos;t more to savor.  Speaking of disappointment, go ahead and prepare yourself for the  potential of more as the closing credits begin to scroll. I admit that  I wanted a little more closure than I was given, and that seemed to be  the audience consensus. I suppose we should admire the screenwriters  for sticking by their guns and refusing to tie all the loose ends as  tightly as test audiences have demanded, but that doesn&apos;t mean we have  to be happy about it. I could have handled it better had it not felt so  abrupt and left me feeling a little incomplete.  But it certainly doesn&apos;t ruin the movie. You just need to check your  expectations and give the film a fair chance. Don&apos;t be a pawn of the  marketing team&apos;s efforts to mislead audiences into the door.  If you&apos;re a Vince fan I would also advise you not to expect the Johnny  Jump-Up zaniness of The Wedding Crashers or Dodgeball. The Break-Up is  a movie of a different breed. Abandoning the temptation to deliver a  consistently uproarious comedy romp, The Break-Up deliberately balances  itself with dramatic conflict, and gives us something a little  different than what Hollywood has forced us to become accustomed to.  It doesn&apos;t do it flawlessly, but at least it makes the attempt.",

I remember the front of the theater had a real casket on display. it was opened and it was a hideous looking corpse with the Lloyd&apos;s of London policy displayed on the inside of the lined lid of the casket. I wanted to go see it that weekend, but my mother said to me &quot;do you want to die?&quot;so I chickened out. I later heard from my school chums that the movie was a big disappointment and don&apos;t bother to see it. I finally got to see it during halloween of 1960 at the same theater where it first opened. there was no casket there to greet me.so i just had the movie to deal with. In watching it I was waiting for the shock moments to occur, but there were just not there, except during the scene in the casket room, and the one in the mausoleum and of course the grand finale with the graveside service at midnight and the discovery of the small casket with it&apos;s horrible contents that managed to issue a scream or two from the rather small audience. I still enjoyed the movie regardless of it&apos;s shortcomings and can hardly wait till it makes it on DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "This was the first Tokusatsu movie that Sampote Sams did with Tsuburaya productions. This would later be the start of a long and weird legal battle between the two. Basically when Sampote Sams made Hanuman and the seven Ultraman movie, he thought he owned the entire franchise, and also Kamen Rider for some reason.\n\nOut of all his Tokusatsu movies, i think this one is the best. It has decent miniature work, decent acting, simple characters, and okay cinematography. But there is still quite a bit of issues with it.\n\nThe sound design for the Tokusatsu fights are terrible, there is no boom when the characters fall down. Also when the two dinosaur creatures show up you can&apos;t tell who is roaring and the roaring NEVER STOPS, they just don&apos;t shut up.\n\nThe character are also pretty paper thin and simple, there is nothing to them. In the first 40 minutes there is a Temple Giant statue, and whenever it is on screen it plays this heroic music and the timing for it is really hit or miss. It also plays the same theme when the Dad and the Kid are taken to the hospital, but I think it&apos;s funny and out of context.\n\nFor some reason when the two giant martians show up in the city, it&apos;s sped up really fast and it looks like the fight scenes in Godzilla raids again. That&apos;s a bad thing.\n\nI do not recommend watching this with the English dub. It&apos;s the worst American dub I&apos;ve ever seen, and some lines are not even translated.\n\nIt might sound like I don&apos;t enjoy this movie, but the last thirty minutes are really fun. Excellent visual effects and better miniatures than the beginning.\n\nI can tell that they put most of the budget into the climax, it&apos;s actually good.\n\nI think this is an underrated Tokusatsu movie, i liked it.",

Well, (I hate to say it)the ending is downright thrilling.....not giving away any details but the confrontation between Pat Morita&apos;s herpetologist/snake wrangler character and the giant cross-breeded snake is a great showdown...leading to the main characters (local policewoman and doctor who happen to be dating)last ditch effort to destroy the snake.  Do not rent this film expecting JAWS.  However, every now and then a subpar film rolls along teetering between a * and ** rating until the last half hour pushes into a respectable ** and a half star rating.  KING COBRA is one such film. (then again the drop kick scene may very well be worth the price of rental...)  Gore fans may be disappointed due to its PG-13 rating and its reliance on &quot;appear from behind&quot; scares...go into this accepting its low budget and you should be ok"

Thank you IMDb. I know I did not fall asleep during the movie but that was how I felt since it seemed I missed something. It is not the worst movie I have seen but I definitely could have used the time in a more rewarding way. For some reason I missed picking up on the fact that the husband was an abusive alcoholic. Also whenever the two main characters were together I felt uncomfortable because it was embarrassing to watch such bad acting.",

John Hamilton, TV&apos;s Perry White in Superman, has a small part in the first and final chapter. For plot, there&apos;s even less logic than usual: bad guy wants to take over world with an army of invisible soldiers, but can barely manage to keep himself invisible.  Overall, below average.",

In the original film, a group of railroad passengers escaping war-torn China are overtaken by Chinese; in the first remake, Night Plane to Chungking, a plane is forced down in a jungle surrounded by Japanese troops. In Peking Express, the chief villains are Chinese again, but the passengers are now refugees of the Communists. Joseph Cotten (as a doctor) and Corinne Calvet (as a &quot;woman of the world&quot;) are among the pilgrims threatened by Oriental outlaw Marvin Miller and his gang. The elements of social and religious hypocrisy in the original Shanghai Express are downplayed in the 1951 version, as is the shady past of leading lady Calvet (who inadequately fills the role originated by Marlene Dietrich). Peking Express is not the classic that the vonSternberg film had been, but on its own is a snappy little melodrama.\n\nHope you find this more useful than Petelush&apos;s posted review of this film, in which he confesses he may not have actually seen the film but describes his childhood vacations in detail?  Why?  Only slightly less useful than asking my cat for a film review."

      "reviewBody": "I watched this movie with a group last night who is familiar with BDSM. Personally, I feel the movie did BDSM an injustice. If I did not know better I would think that in order for someone to become involved in a &quot;power exchange,&quot; they would have to be enticed with big money or some reason other than their need to be in a supportive and loving environment. A true BDSM relationship involves a &quot;power exchange&quot; which comes from the person&apos;s need to submit, a gift of submission to their Master or Dominant. \n\nBy mixing in the slave trade it only misinformed those who have no knowledge of this type of relationship, and who try to use fear tactics to make us look as if we are a danger to society. In no way did I feel that the movie showed any type of a growing relationship that would justify anyone giving up the degree of control that was displayed. Her devotion was bought and paid for.\n\nOne comment from the audience was that the acting was comparable to a porno flick. Being knowledgeable as to the true relationships involved in BDSM we could see through the errors. For someone not familiar, it would only make them think that BDSM is a horrible thing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone outside of the BDSM scene.",

      "reviewBody": "Here we are. The Justice League. DC&apos;s greatest superheroes come together to save the world...and what is the first scene you ask? Henry Cavill&apos;s CGI&apos;d shaved face. Ohhh dear...yup...we&apos;re in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world. Sighhhh...I kinda just want to hug this film and repeatedly whisper &quot;there, there...it&apos;ll all be alright.&quot;. Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn&apos;t that bad. But, it&apos;s not great either. The film&apos;s greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than &quot;Thor Ragnarok&quot;) and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word &quot;lazy&quot;. I cannot be dealing with another &apos;save the world&apos; situation. I&apos;m also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I&apos;m afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so.",

      "name": "A routine Spaghetti Western with usual elements and shot in Almeria, Spain.",
      "reviewBody": "A major robbery goes wrong when two young men named Loring Vandervelt (Peter Lee Lawrence) and a mysterious stranger Francis Parker (Luis Davila) join forces and stand in the way of Mexican bandits led by General Valiente (Tanio Cimarosa) and his second in command named Agustín (Jesús Guzmán that in his more than ninety years he continues to interpret) and an evil, corrupt and powerful owner. The rest is about more robberies, thieves, bosses, deceptions, treason, vendetta, etc.\n\nA mediocre, though passable Spanish/Italian co-production in which the director fails to harmonize the various trends presented in the development, in fact it is a serious-comical Spaghetti Western, as the viewer becomes bored at several moments because the film does not have the expository clarity that it would have needed to become a worthy work. The film is based on silly anecdotes and when it wants it flirts with varied and uneven tones without ever revealing firmness. The characters are also too cartoonish and have heavy verbiage. The film is saved because there are other even worse exponents of this sub-genre and there are some nice main and support actors, though interpretations in general are commonplace. The story seems as modest and slight as its twists and turns, so the film splatters inconsequentially, at least until you&apos;ve mastered the steps towards the final climax. Fernando Cerchio&apos;s third work as a Western director makes use of a common S. W. motif : the struggle for a loot. This time, however, it is not a hard precious metal that is in demand, but printed dollars, a not inconsiderable sum of money of $300,000. Effective sight gags, hardworking cast can&apos;t overcome pitfalls in the storyline, which indecisively meanders between western and comedy. When played for laughter, this works pretty well, while the action scenes generate an atmosphere of tension and amusement enough, but failing to explore the necessary development of characters, the movie becomes an inflated lightweight comedy whose shortcomings are all too visible. The central characters is Peter Lee Lawrence as Loring Vandervelt, the affectionate young blonde German Peter Lee Lawrence, who made his uncredited debut in Sergio Leone&apos;s For a Few Dollars More (1965), was the hero of many Spaghetti or Paella Westerns. His short cinematographic career can be encompassed in nine years of Italian-Spanish co-productions, however he died before reaching the age of 30 due to brain cancer but at least he managed to marry a well-known Eurotrah goddess: Cristina Galbó. On the other hand, the second man in the exhibition group, Luis Dávila as Francis Parker , he was one of the several Argentine performers who settled in Spain during the 60s and who was not lacking in a certain artistic dignity, as he does a good job and is at the same time the acting highlight of a film that reveals some shortfalls and furthermore, Tano Cimarosa as the excessively talkative and foul-mouthed General Valiente. The latter steals the show playing a character similar to the many portrayed by Fernando Sancho as a swaggering and boastful Mexican bandit. This Spaghetti is also not very convincing, their playing seems too uninspired. One of the positive points of the film is the soundtrack composed by Luis Bacalov, he creates a pretty good musical score in Ennio Morricone style. Luis Enriquez Bacalov, who many years later composed ¨Il Postino¨ which won a well-deserved Hollywood Oscar . Bacalov was able to maneuver our hearts and ears into wellness mode with so many excellent melodies, from genre cinema to mainstream. The director of photography, Julio Ortas, does it much better, who is able to convey attractive presentations of the protagonists and the background landscape from semi-close-ups and American shots. Filmed in places in Manzanares del Real, Madrid and Almería, there are beautiful scenes riding in the distance. A film that has just enough to satisfy European Western fans who are not too demanding.",

      "reviewBody": "Director &amp; writer of a startling documentary, Arthur Dong, does great research of anti-gay hate crime murderers; some of whom are currently on US death rows: Donald Aldrich (Killer); Corey Burley (Killer); Raymond Childs (Killer); William Cross (Killer); Kenneth French (Killer); Jay Johnson (Killer); Jeffrey Swinford (Killer).\n\nAward winner of 2 prestigious Sundance Film Festival awards, the Directors &amp; the Filmmakers Trophies, Arthur Dong has become more renowned since producing &quot;Licensed to Kill.&quot; His documentary goes beyond the pale of simple-minded media headlines (that miss hundreds of brutal anti-gay hate crimes in the US each year) of anti-gay murders by scrutinizing the killers themselves. To no one&apos;s surprise, many claim they feel &apos;licensed&apos; by preachers they&apos;ve heard to do &quot;God&apos;s work&quot;: murder gays. While others claim they&apos;s been violently &amp;/or sexually abused as children (usually by their own straight, white fathers-97% of the time).\n\nIn 1977, gaybashers attacked filmmaker Arthur Dong. Perhaps this event led to his personal reason for filming face-to-face cell block interviews with murderers convicted &amp; sentenced to death for killing gay men. Cutting to the chase, Dong asks on-point, &quot;Why did you do it?&quot; These death row inmates use the typical variety of lame excuses: 1) The number 1 reason is the &apos;God told me to&apos; anti-gay hate-crime defense party line. Considering what key televangelists the late Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, J.D. Kennedy, Pat Robertson et al, publicly instigate through their anti-gay sexually obsessed &apos;sermons&apos;, it&apos;s no wonder blaming God for murdering gays is hate-criminals&apos; top ranked sense of being &apos;licensed to kill&apos; by US anti-gay sexual supremacists.\n\n2) Claims they are justified to kill gays as protection from his murder victim&apos;s sexual advances is the number 2 gay murderers&apos; defense party line. This popular excuse among lawyers is known as the &quot;gay panic&quot; defense. Apparently, anti-gay murderers don&apos;t know how to say the easy word, &quot;No,&quot; &amp; walk away, if a same-gender person flirts with them! Instead they go ballistic &amp; kill. Note: this is specific to anti-gay men who murder gay men &amp; has nothing to do with women.\n\n3) The claim that &apos;I am a victim of child abuse who fears losing my manhood&apos;, is the number 3 most likely excuse these murderers &amp; their defense lawyers use. Sometimes law enforcers collaborate with this defense.\n\n4) The &apos;homeboys&apos; depraved mentality that stalks for &quot;easy prey&apos; excuse; straight men who go out of their way to guess &amp; stalk men they perceive are gay; pretend to be gay themselves &amp; pick up gay men; then, kill them for sport.\n\n5) The &apos;I don&apos;t want gays in the military with me&apos; excuse. These unfortunate soldiers have no clue they&apos;re already serving with thousands of gay, lesbian, bisexual &amp; transgender people in the US &amp; other nations&apos; militaries! Many of the anti-gay murderers are delusional enough to believe they&apos;re righteously doing a murderous God&apos;s &amp; a sexually-supremacist US government&apos;s authorized work by ridding the world of non-heterosexual people.\n\n(See Dr. Gregory Herek&apos;s research on anti-gay hate crimes for more stats &amp; do view this starling true (1997) film. It reveals how anti-gay murderers are victims of untruth: especially US neo-Christian-fundamentalist-supremacist politicized propaganda).\n\nIt&apos;s scary &amp; intriguing that believing in this propaganda has already led to murders of many heterosexuals who were perceived to be gay!"

      "reviewBody": "In 1988, Olivia Newton-John recorded one of the most daring and outstanding albums of her now 40+ year career, entitled &quot;THE RUMOUR&quot;. It also happened to be Australia&apos;s bicentennial that year. Olivia decided to showcase her new album and salute her adopted homeland simultaneously. The result is this hour-long show, which incorporates most of the songs from THE RUMOUR in video-type format. It plays as a sort of brief, basic historical document about Australia, and features several intriguing &quot;Aussie&quot; characters. But mostly, it&apos;s a chance for the English-born, Aussie-bred vocalist to present some of her strongest material in years, all with this wonderful Australian backdrop. Opening the show with a bubbly tune called &quot;Tutta La Vita&quot;, Newton-John reminds us she&apos;s not one to take herself too seriously. And yet there&apos;s plenty of &quot;meat&quot; in the lyrics. The song deals with the subject of getting older, searching to find what&apos;s meaningful in one&apos;s life, and not fooling oneself. She candidly addresses the issue of AIDS in a richly-produced &quot;Love And Let Live&quot;, which features gentle verses that explode into punky-pop choruses. Her gorgeous soprano has a bit of edgy grit in that tune. Long before it was &quot;hip&quot; to be an environmentalist, Olivia put her money where her heart was, even canceling a Japanese tour in the 1970&apos;s to protest fishing practices that were killing dolphins. &quot;Let&apos;s Talk About Tomorrow&quot; is a call to protect the Earth for our children&apos;s sake, if not our own. The subject of evolving roles of women in Aussie life is breached both in songs (&quot;Get Out&quot; &amp; &quot;Old-Fashioned Man&quot;) and interviews with local ladies. &quot;Big And Strong&quot; is played against a backdrop of Aboriginal lands and people. Listening to the songs featured in OLIVIA: DOWN UNDER reveals a much under-rated singer. She may not have the most technically studied voice, but I&apos;ve never FELT more emotional connection to words in song than those coming from this woman&apos;s amazing heart-rooted pipes! When she sings the words &quot;through fire&quot; near the end of &quot;Walk Through Fire&quot; and punches a hi-A, it sounds like she literally put her finger in the flame. Why the album, with its Elton John-produced (and co-performed) title track, and some of her best work, was not a huge hit makes very little sense. Even the &quot;filler&quot; (like &quot;Car Games&quot;) is good stuff. Perhaps being a fairly new mom (her daughter was only 2 years old) plays into that, as she was not very active promoting the album (beyond this special) and was not touring during those years. Yet happily, she did take the time to leave us with this amazing hour of fabulous music and a short documentary &apos;film&apos;. Her love of Australia is clinched in the featured (non-album) song &quot;It&apos;s Always Australia For Me&quot;. Malibu has not spoiled this &quot;girl from Oz&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "An epic drama movie about the obstinate captain Whip : Charlton a Heston going back to Hawaii . He has inherited a worthless land , but Whip then becomes himself a powerful pineapple owner by smuggling pineapple from French Guyana . Meanwhile , aboard his ship , The Carthaginian , there is a cargo of Chinese emigrants : Tina Chen and Mako subsequently disembarking in Hawaii following hardship ways . As Heston and his ambition bringing distresses to his family via his stubborness . Dealing with the Giant Story of Modern Hawaii in which mean colonists attempt to topple the Hawaii Queen and to create a new state to unite it to the United States . Along the way Whip prohibites his son : John Philip Law to marry a Chinese girl . The continuation of James A Michener&apos;s epic novel, Hawaii !\n\nA soap opera and unpretentious entertainment movie about a proud and mighty pineapple owner and his family, including drama , love stories and tragedy . A James A. Michener&apos;s enormous novel and compressed it into compact , intelligent and sensitive scenes . This is the follow-up to Hawaii 1966 by George Roy Hill with Richard Harris , Julie Andrews , Max Von Sidow , Gene Hackman , concerning a stiff-upper-lip minister sent to Hawaii to convert the natives . In this sequel , The Hawaiians 1970 , Charlton Heston gives a fine performance in his ordinary style as the tough and bigoted land baron who founds an empire in pineapples and he will stop at nothing to get his civilian or political purports . His portrait clearly delineates the authority and alternating torment to communicate his emotions . Heston also performed a similar movie titled &quot; Diamond Head&quot; 1962, equally playing an ambitious pineapple owner . While Geraldine Chaplin is passable , though she has not quite the weight for the role of the consumptive wife . There&apos;s a captivating performance from Tina Chen as the pregnant Chinese emigrant who disembarks in Hawaii to face off a new life along with Mako . Accompanied by good secondaries as Alec McCowen, John Phillip Law, Don Knight , James Gregory , MIko Mayama and you&apos;ll have to concentrate harder to pick up actors as Chris Robinson, Lyle Bettger and James Hong .\n\nIt displays a marvellous and gorgeous cinematography from the sunny Hawaii by cameramen Lucien Ballard and Philip H Lathrop . As well as a rousing and stirring musical score by Henry Mancini .The motion picture was uneven but professionally directed by Tom Gries , including some flaws and disjointed scenes . Tom was a good craftsman who made a lot of films as cinema as television until his early death at 54 . As he directed Westerns as 100 rifles , Will Penny , Mustang , Nevada Smith and other genres as in Breakout and The Glass House . Rating : 6/10 . The movie will appeal to Charlton Heston fans .",

I call it &quot;The Last Tango in Paris&quot; effect. Much like that film&apos;s director Bernardo Bertolucci, Ali Ozgenturk is a realist director whose films often feel like documentaries. He gained notoriety with &quot;At- The Horse&quot; almost two decades ago. Other than &quot;Bekci-The Watchman&quot; few of his films have reminded viewers of his initial artistic success. &quot;Balalayka&quot; is that reminder though. It is a story which is at the very heart of today&apos;s Turkey, a country and culture which has always been affected by the geopolitical changes around its&apos; borders. The fall of the Soviet Union and the impending economic struggles of the Russian people has actually lead to many Russian immigrating to Turkey- a country where more people tend to leave the country, as my father did, for work outside. And, alas many Russian women have fallen into prostitution rings which manipulate their need for economic gain. The film also shows the role of family in Turkish life, and how that infastructure, so absent in the West especially in America, has allowed for people to go on with their lives in spite of adversity and tragedy. Kemal Sunal, the great Turkish comic actor who died suddenly as he was set to go to Trabzon- the Black Sea region- to star in this movie is a figure who will be a hero of Turkish cinema for many years to come. It is hard to say that anyone can replace him, but in this film Ugur Yucel does a tremendous job in his place and in the process he manages to equal Sunal&apos;s last film appearance in the great Turkish comedy &quot;Propaganda.&quot; I hope with the arrival of &quot;Uzak-Distance&quot; in U.S. theaters next year, there will be a renewed interest in Turkish cinema. It could allow more people to view films like &quot;Balayka&quot; and applaud them for the fact that their artisitc merit empahtically surpasses whatever technical deficiencies one may see in such films.",

So, &quot;hate&quot; is surely a word too harsh but I don&apos;t care about his life.\n\nNevertheless, the story raises good questions: \n\nFor one time, you see a man becoming a &quot;sex-object&quot; and it&apos;s great to achieve this sort of equality with women in charge. From my point of view, it&apos;s not a revolution: I always thought, that in relationships, men court but women decide! But I am not the Di Caprio / Pitt / Clooney mold, too! Thus, the truth would be that it&apos;s the sexiest who runs the relation whatever the gender! It&apos;s a tyranny of beauty then! \n\nAnd as depicted in the movie, nowadays, when beauty is there, money is not far away. What can we do for money? Is everything for sell? Money leads to freedom or alienation? When you see the beautiful opening credits, you wonder..\n\nFor sure, Lee is a talented director and knows how to tell a story, even disturbing for your beliefs.\n\nPS: and don&apos;t forget FRANK WILLS, a man who stayed true to his principles instead of money!",

Ignore such reviews.\n\nSecond, the plot of the movie runs on the lines of meta-physical monologue of the protagonist., which is quintessentially the very fundamental element of this genre. \n\nIn most high-budget movies, to cater the broader audience, this element is generally faded out romance elements, human conflicts, moral paradoxes. Not in this. This strictly confined to meta-physical aspects of existentialism one faces when they are alone and divorced off the world. \n\nI could have given 10, but I am disappointed by the ending. Wish, there is more philosophical monologue in the end. That&apos;s the only disappointment of this film. \n\nIn the beginning, the plot seems way too cliche. Please understand, its just setting stage for the character. If you could push through the part and involve meditative with the character, trust me, its a beautiful movie. \n\nGive it a try with your heart . . . It won&apos;t disappoint."

      "name": "1967 begins Chang Yi&apos;s career starting at Shaw Borthers studio",
      "reviewBody": "This movie begins with a black faced character, Bao Zheng. He was a real judge in ancient China. He became legend for his uncompromising position against corrupt government officials. His strong sense of justice made him a folk hero of the common people. In Chinese opera he is portrayed with dark skin and a white birthmark on his forehead and rather ugly. Since 2000, Justice Bao has been the title character of at least three Chinese television series. Justice Bao does not hesitate to execute a corrupt official in the first scene. Historically, Bao had three guillotines and they are currently on display in the Kaifeng Court, Henan, China. Executing officials who have many high placed friends certainly has consequences. The Hsiang brothers (one is the grandmaster of all martial arts movies - Liu Chia-Liang) are ordered to kill Judge Bao. It isn&apos;t until about 5 minutes into the movie that the title character played by Chang Yi literally drops in. There is scant biographical information about Chang Yi. HKMDB notes that he came to Shaw Brothers at age 22 after 8 years as a Beijing Opera student in Taiwan. That implies he began as a student at age 14. Typically opera students begin at a much earlier age. Flexibility is the single most important physical need in Chinese opera. That is natural at an early age but even at age 14 much of that natural flexibility is gone. Chang Yi does display the physical attributes of an opera performer. In &quot;The Thundering Sword&quot; he does a forward flip. In general, he swings a sword convincingly from his first fight. Chang Yi&apos;s career began at Shaw Brothers in 1967 as lead opposite Cheng Pei Pei in &quot;The Thundering Sword&quot;, followed by &quot;The Silent Swordsman&quot; and then this movie. He peaked in 1977 and 1978, the two most prolific years in martial arts movie history. After that he seemed to realize the dream was over and retired to Canada and only did a few small roles. The key plot point comes up next and seems to be missing something in the translation. The emperor is impressed with Chang Yi&apos;s kung fu and gives him a title &quot;King Cat&quot;. He is not impressed with titles, a characteristic that matches Judge Bao. So he refuses the title and position but continues to offer help if needed. The news of his title and position goes to a clan of &quot;mouse&quot; characters: Skyward, Underground, Mountain, Underwater, and Brocaded Mouse. Brocaded Mouse, in particular, is extremely offended by this. Why? That&apos;s the part that doesn&apos;t translate.\n\nAs for the movie review, this 97 minutes is only for fans of the martial arts genre who are interested in the history of the genre and Shaw Brothers. The fights are mostly one raised sword striking another. The leaps are wire work and reverses done only because they could be done and do not add anything. Every aspect of filming and fighting is outdated. Yet the movie draws you in and keeps your attention the entire duration.",

I much appreciated the crude and natural poetry of the film and,of course, the wonderful music. The photography also impressed me quite a lot and in my opinion Lima Barreto could have been influenced by Carol Reed. By all means, this film can certainly compete with the best &quot;westerns&quot; and should be given a chance to touch the actual generation by means of video, DVD etc. Although, since then, we have larger screens and color, this kind of picture in black and white proves, if necessary, that masterpieces exists without that.",

But, I did not find it to be as sensual as its billing had led me to believe. I expected a more erotic, sensual overtone to some of the story and/or the scenes. But, instead it was a tale laced with opium, betrayal, and desperation in a world that was changing from the old ways of ancient China to the newer ways of the West. I can see why it would have caused such controversy in China in the first place, as the box proclaims. But, I think that words like, &quot;Sensuous,&quot; &quot;Steamy,&quot; and  &quot;Ravishing,&quot; were over-used. It was a good story not for the tame of heart or mind. There are many quiet parts of the movie where there is little action and few words. It works well if you have the mindset to pay attention patiently. I think that a film like this will appeal to select audiences and I would be a little weary to recommend it to everyone. I think some people will like this film, others absolutely love it, while others yet may be bored with the slow-moving action and dark dialogues.",

(1972) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nSoftcore remake of Roger Corman&apos;s The Little Shop of Horrors manages to show a lot of skin as well as turn out to be a smart spoof in its own right. Buck Kartalian (from Planet of the Apes) plays a loser who lives with his mom and hasn&apos;t even been with a woman. One day he buys a plant, which turns out to have a sexy female voice but even weirder is that the plant needs live food to stay alive. There&apos;s no question that this one here is more sex than horror but as far as these Something Weird type films goes this one is pretty good. There are quite a few funny scenes with our loser trying to comfort the plant who is dying of hunger. There are even better scenes of him battling with his mother who hears the female plant&apos;s voice and thinks that her virgin son has a real woman in his bed. There are countless sex scenes and I was rather shocked at how far one went but for the most part they are fairly harmless and not too erotic."

      "reviewBody": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning \n\nA short film from Ken Loach, showing mining communities in Durham, North Yorkshire and Wales banding together in the midst of pit closures, lay offs and redundancies during the early 1980s, regaling each other with songs, poems and stories of their experiences during what were tough and testing times. Loach used excerpts from this in his 2013 documentary The Spirit of &apos;45, and it was included as an extra in the DVD release of that film.\n\nAs the 80s loomed, and the wave of globalisation consumed the world, certain casualties were claimed along the way, and it&apos;s hard to think of any more documented than the once thriving towns and communities in places like the North East of England, where trade coming in and out pretty much revolved around the pits. The eerie, agoraphobic photography of these areas at the beginning is perfectly captured by Loach, and shines a light on a forgotten little corner of the earth as everyone else started living big. But what is most perfectly captured is the sense of a community united together, who understand each other probably better than they&apos;d understand anybody in the outside world.\n\nThis probably benefits more than anything from being right in the cut and thrust of the events as they were happening thirty years ago, where the urgency and relevance was at its peak and the expressions on everyone&apos;s faces was very much real. It was highlighting a very real plight, but as a result it&apos;s also very much one sided. It was, in fact, rejected by The South Bank Show for being &apos;politically impartial&apos;, which says a lot. In the space of less than an hour, it presents Thatcher, the police and the &apos;scabs&apos; as the demons of the Earth, while the striking miners and their families are nothing but sweetness and light, singing their songs, making you wonder why they didn&apos;t all get other careers as singer-songwriters since they&apos;re so good at it? \n\nThat said, they provide the film with some of its most effective touches, most notably the haunting &apos;The Dead, That&apos;s the Price of Coal&apos;, which illuminates not just the then present struggle, but the history of miners, their lacklustre safety conditions and the public&apos;s unfair expectations of them. Despite it&apos;s obvious political leanings, it&apos;s still an impassioned and convictive piece of film making that captures the mood and desperation of the time. ***",

When the killer is caught and brought to trial, but only receives a 25 year jail sentence for his heinous crime, the distraught couple decide to take the law into their own hands and exact a far more fitting punishment.\n\nThe Tortured is, as the title suggests, yet another in the recent wave of horror films that have (un)popularly been dubbed &apos;torture porn&apos;; however, rather than try to make the viewer turn away in disgust at gory atrocities inflicted upon innocent victims, as is usually the case with this sub-genre, the intention here is to appeal to the audience&apos;s most primal emotions, fulfilling a basic desire for sweet justice by depicting a twisted piece of human garbage on the receiving end of some serious pain and humiliation for a change.\n\nThis twist on an already well-worn theme might have worked if it wasn&apos;t for an unnecessary and totally unbelievable twist at the end which robs the viewer of any real satisfaction. Add the fact that the violence perpetrated is far from stomach churning (the gore is most unimpressive with the yuckiest scene turning out to be a dream) and the plot requires major suspension of disbelief (for example, one is expected to believe that, after a van has somersaulted off a bridge, sailed through the air, and crashed face-down onto some jagged rocks, those inside have all miraculously survived death), and what you have is a bland and instantly forgettable effort, another nail in the coffin for a horror trend that should have been buried long ago.",

Didn&apos;t hesitate buying a $13 ticket.\n\nWatching the film for half-hour, I was totally bored. This film has nothing new in it. Absolutely waste of time. This movie is a torture. Cheap film.\n\nCast like: Ajay devgan (one of my fav. Actor), Sunil shetty shouldn&apos;t have signed this movie at first place. This movie has same old bollywood flavor with nothing new.\n\nIn some scenes you could actually see the camera shadows. There was this scene where Ajay Devgan was wearing a black goggles.and the camera zooms on his faceand you could actually see those big lighting screen on his goggles.\n\nTechnical work in this movie is so so so bad.\n\nA cheap Bollywood film.\n\nNothing is good about this movie!!! This movie is not recommended if you are fan of Ajay Devgan or Sunil Shetty. You will be disappointed big time.\n\nI would rate this movie 1/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Intrigue. In Alien, the characters don&apos;t know what they&apos;re getting into and the only reason the audience knows is because 1. The trailers, 2. the Title and 3. by now everyone knows the reputation of the film . . . and it was good. In Aliens the characters know the creature, and declare war neglecting to calculate the possible numbers they face . . . and it was good. In Alien 3 we get a prison. &quot;But they&apos;re not prepared! That&apos;s the intrigue,&quot; you say to which I would answer, &quot;If they were prepared there *couldn&apos;t* be a film. They&apos;d take out the Alien in 10 minutes.&quot;\n\nAlien 3 just cannot compete with its predecessors. The film is &apos;okay&apos; and it&apos;s up against two of the most influential sci-fi horror films by Ridley Scott (the director with the slickest style) and James Cameran (one of the best action directors) scores composed by the legendary Goldsmith and Horner. . . Alien 3 has David Fincher and Elliot Goldenthal. Fincher is a good director, but outclassed by Scott &amp; Cameran; Goldenthall has yet to impress me with one of his scores, and has yet to not annoy me with one of his &quot;sequel&quot; scores (Batman Forever &amp; Batman &amp; Robin come to mind). \n\nThe uninteresting premise of the film, the uninteresting setting, uninteresting characters, uninteresting story in the end just kill the film.\n\nMore effort seemed to go into shaving Weaver&apos;s head than making the script good. And, I&apos;m sorry, but the handful of well crafted scenes where Ripley is emotionally torn, or faces a difficult decision--the whole 3 scenes in the film what have a valid &apos;deeper meaning&apos; does not save the 90% of the film that is boring and stale. \n\nMany people found the jump from Aliens to Alien 3, the return to one alien and the fate of the survivors from Aliens unforgivable. I&apos;m somewhat torn--I don&apos;t mind such things happening if the new route is good. The route chosen for Alien 3 was mediocre, and so the break from its predecessors did come across more disappointing. Change is not always good; change for the sake of change is typically bad. Alien 3 is a good example of this. \n\nIn the end, all of the elements of the film are mediocre to good with the exception of the script which did not live up to standards. Hence, the film is overall just &quot;okay.&quot; But after the caliber of its predecessors, Alien 3 really is a disappointment in terms of quality."

Wheeler Dealers features James Garner at the top of his game, Lee Remick doing her best Doris Day imitation, and a wonderful cast of some of the best character actors ever assembled.\n\nOf all the characters James Garner has created for the screen, I think I like Henry J. Tyroon the best. Cowboy oilman and conman par excellence, he moves skillfully from one situation to the other in business, but really comes up against it with Lee Remick in the romance department.\n\nThe supporting cast is soooo good I don&apos;t know where to begin to single anyone out. If put to torture I suppose I&apos;d have to mention Louis Nye, &quot;the boss wrangler of the Henry Tyroon collection&quot;, and John Astin the manic SEC investigator.\n\nAs Mr. Garner puts it: &quot;Only the taxman loses in a Henry Tyroon deal&quot;. Even a the most dedicated and humorless IRS agent will find laughs in this classic comedy.\n\n&quot;I&apos;M INTERESTED IN THE ECONOMICS OF ANY SITUATION&quot;",

The anti-hero is perfectly ambiguous, at times cold blooded and calculating, at times likable, humble, and human. What&apos;s worse, as life&apos;s choices come at a price, no matter which good life one chooses, the price is almost too much to bear once ensconced in this dirty employ. The acting was phenomenal, with our lead portraying an impossibly good-hearted, cold-blooded career criminal. The story itself contains all of the requisite elements of a good mob drama. The fights scenes were brutally realistic as opposed to stylistic orchestrations of over-the-top martial arts excellence. The score was wonderfully antagonistic to the realities on the screen. The ending was left open for subtle interpretation, where betrayals and motivations are left for the imagination to fill in. Merci beaucoup.\n\nEvil Eye Reviews",

It presents a story revolving around a little boy deposited in the centre of an international bike race by his father; who is one of the stars. His mother also present and her lover; also one of the (new) stars of the bike race. These are the characters at the core. Sounds impossible but somehow it seems to work! Mixing in rivalries and jealousies on the track and the defeat of the elder statesman.\n\nThe vignettes of the crowd are effective if a little clumsy, the audience scenes shine, being genuine!"

It sets Price out to commit evil deeds even though he fights against it. Then he meets sweet Odette (Nancy Kovack) and things go out of control....\n\nWell-made, colorful (some BEAUTIFUL set design here), low-key horror film. The plot is interesting and the acting is good (especially Price and Kovack). There&apos;s next to no violence in this one (the one murder scene is badly faked)...it mostly concentrates on Price fighting against the Horla. There&apos;s a few very interesting discussions between Price and the demon about good, evil and morality. It all leads up to a great climax. If you&apos;re looking for a blood and guts movie this isn&apos;t it but it is an intelligent thoughtful horror film. Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s clear from other reviews that more or less everybody is agreed about the director&apos;s rather tricksy film-making and the lack of conventional narrative drive. It&apos;s just a question of whether you think these things make for a good film or a bad film.\n\nFor me, the good outweighs the bad: the deliberately non-emotional characterization, slow pace, and powerful use of landscape push viewers out of their comfort zone, and force us to confront some pretty basic realities about life and war.\n\nIt&apos;s the parallels - not the contrasts - between home life and the war that are most interesting. On many occasions, the film seems to have a deliberately timeless, ahistorical feel, so that the characters feel tremendously elemental (the word medieval springs to mind too) in their behaviours and concerns. Despite a slight lack of coherence (not necessarily in the plot, more in the overall conception), we do genuinely somehow care for the characters - quite an achievement given the overall tone of the movie.\n\nThe use of Flanders as the setting and title reinforces this sense of historical continuity, of war recurring down through the ages - not for nothing is the region known as &quot;the cockpit of Europe&quot;. And by the way, a big chunk of historical Flanders is now in France (the French-plated cars, with &quot;59&quot; indicating the North department which includes most of French Flanders, are a giveaway). French Flanders is by definition not in Belgium, as one reviewer has suggested. However, one of the female characters (Barbe&apos;s friend) appears to have a strong Flemish (i.e. Dutch-speaking) accent - a nice touch, and not entirely implausible in this border region, where a few people still speak Flemish on the French side of the border (visit Hondschoote, and you&apos;ll see what I mean).\n\nThis film should make everybody rethink their approach to war, and the impact of sending young men (and women, although not in this film) from more or less every generation off to fight and die (remember that Flanders was scarred by war twice in a lifetime in the 20th century). Not necessarily a particularly easy watch on the face of it, but a powerful and worthwhile one.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a dark and brutal morality tale of guilt and redemption, the movie &quot;PIETA&quot; tells a story of a debt collector Kang-do(Lee Jeong-jin) works as a debt collector for some loan shark, and he is someone you don&apos;t want to mess with especially if you happen to borrow the money from his boss. Even if his poor debtors really have no money to pay back, he gets the money back by any ruthless means necessary. These unfortunate debtors usually work at the metal shops located on the narrow alleys of Seoul, so they are forced to get their hands or feet injured by their machines for paying him back through the insurance money they will acquire. During one comic but cringe-inducing moment, one debtor nervously asks him to cut both of his hands instead of only one hand because he needs more money to pay his debts and support his baby to be born.\n\nKang-do&apos;s life is as barren as his debtors&apos;. While his home looks a little more comfortable, he has lived alone in his apartment. He cooks for himself, and he usually brings live animals to his home for his dinner. To represent his beastly nature, he prefers to buy a live chicken and then butcher it instead of just purchasing a dead one. On one day, his life is disrupted by the sudden appearance of one mysterious woman(Cho Min-soo), who claims to be his mother and apologizes to him for abandoning him not so long after he was born. Resentful toward his mother he does not remember, he does not believe any of her words and brusquely rejects her, but she keeps coming to him. She slowly insinuates herself into his daily life while behaving like a mother who tries to compensate for her unforgivable fault in the past. Though he harshly treats her, she sticks to him while doing what mothers usually do for their dear sons. She cooks for him, and she says genially to this detestable man who has probably never experienced love or kindness for a long time.\n\nThere is quite a disturbing scene where Kang-do cruelly attempts to violate her with his own twisted logic, and you may wonder how much she can tolerate him, if she is indeed who she seems to be. Induced by her love without condition, Kang-do slowly reveals a vulnerable child with lots of hurts inside him; he eventually finds himself depending on her care, and they momentarily have a nice time together as a mother and her son.The tension in the drama largely depends on the simple but fearless performance by Cho Min-soo, who deftly maintains the elusive side of her character even at the most emotionally anguished moment. Their characters may look silly when they behave like a mother and her little son, but we come to accept the emotional bond forming between them.\n\nAnd later scenes become very intense and heart touching. Overall I do not think it is one of his best films because of its several flaws, but I must say it is nice to see that this talented director is still capable of making a movie with conviction, power, and several interesting things to talk about.",

      "reviewBody": "Cafe Metropole (1937) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nDecent comedy about the American Alexis (Tyrone Power) who loses a big bet to Monsieur Victor (Adolphe Menjou) and afterwards has to admit that he doesn&apos;t have the money to pay up. Through what&apos;s basically blackmail, Victor forces Alexis to romance the beautiful and rich Laura (Loretta Young) so that she will marry him and in return Alexis can pay Victor. CAFE METROPOLE offers up a terrific cast but sadly the screenplay is just a tad bit too silly and too far-fetched to be believable. Yes, you might argue that any type of comedy can be silly as long as it makes you laugh and this is certainly true but there&apos;s not enough laughs here to really call this a comedy and what happens at the end is just so out of touch with reality that you really can&apos;t help but roll your eyes. However, the two leads are in fine form and manage to have that wonderful chemistry that they did throughout their careers. Power isn&apos;t believable playing &quot;Russian&quot; but this here isn&apos;t all that important as I can overlook this as part of the comedy. Young is as charming as ever and just floats with her grace on camera. The two of them have that good chemistry together and help keep the film moving. Menjou is also good in his supporting role even though the screenplay does very little to actually help him. I think the film works best early on when we see Power and Menjou going after one another as they try to solve the issue with the money. Once Young enters the picture you have the before mentioned chemistry but the screenplay just becomes too wacky for its own good. I think a dose of reality would have really helped things and the various crosses in the final fifteen-minutes just don&apos;t work. Still, fans of the three stars will still want to check this one out."

It is probably loosely based on the exploits of Lyle Bull and Charles Hunter who on 30 October 1967 flew a solo flight over Hanoi and received the Navy Cross. Here is part of the citation for Bull: Lieutenant Bull assisted in the planning and execution of an extremely dangerous, single-plane, night, radar bombing attack on the strategically located and heavily defended Hanoi railroad ferry slip in North Vietnam. Although the entire Hanoi defensive effort was concentrated upon his lone bomber, he flawlessly assisted his pilot in navigating the aircraft to the target area and commencing an attack. Seconds before bomb release, six enemy surface-to-air missiles were observed to be tracking on his plane. Undaunted by this threat to his personal safety, Lieutenant Bull assisted his pilot in taking swift and effective action to avoid the missiles and complete the attack, releasing all weapons in the target area with extreme accuracy. After release, four more missiles were fired at his aircraft in addition to the intense anti-aircraft-artillery fire.",

      "reviewBody": "After finally having their own home, a couple and their daughter try to adjust to living out in the wilderness which eventually forces them to come to terms with the rumors of the house being haunted by the spirit of a vicious ghost looking to kidnap the daughter and must try to save her from the ghost.\n\nGenerally speaking, the film has a lot to like. Where it works best is the fun and engaging setup that brings the family to the remote house in the first place. The general idea of the family being much more accustomed to city-life moving out into the countryside not just to escape the noise and stress that entails but also for their financial constraints serves this nicely by addressing the common trope of why they&apos;re unwilling to leave the location when it starts to get spooky since they have no choice. By calling out the various sightings the daughter has in the surrounding woods or the reported incidents they have which highlight something not being right in the area as being unfamiliar with the area and the move to a new house, there&apos;s a rather fun old-school haunted house setup present in the film. That plays into the attachment to the cat that she finds left behind or the strange lullaby that she begins singing that signals something much more sinister at play but just gets written off as adjusting to the surroundings. As well, the film features a really enjoyable tone once the ghost is revealed and starts attacking the family. With the early scenes hinting that something might be hanging around the house with brief glimpses of someone or something lurking through windows spying on them or just being aware that a figure has terrified the daughter, the intriguing setup here prepares this to move into the supernatural involving the discovery of the Pocong&apos;s presence and the daughter&apos;s abduction. Featuring a rather fun seance gone wrong, the father heading off on a special journey to recapture the daughter and a big confrontation with the being holding her hostage along with the other ghost children, there are some chilling sequences in this section that highlights the danger posed by the creature haunting the family and setting the stage for the series of intriguing ideas in the final half where the action picks up considerably. Aware of the ruse that has occurred and the double-switch involving the identity swap of the particular characters, her terrified state that emerges here creates a chilling setup involving the desire to warn her mother to return and attempt to rescue her. That provides the launch to a fun series of revelations and remarks about what&apos;s going on and who the ghost really is and what she wants with the daughter as the backstory revelation about what happened and the final method for stopping the ghost which generates a lot of enjoyable aspects that have a lot to like. These aspects provide this with plenty of likable qualities to hold it up over its few minor flaws. There aren&apos;t too many drawbacks to the film but there are a couple. The main detriment here is the story that focuses way too much on aping other films instead of being original and clever. Way too often the audience is far ahead of the characters in here because of the lack of originality in the concepts being employed. The constant attempts at jump-scares with the ghost popping up in windows or trying to come up behind unsuspecting victims feel copied from so many foreign genre efforts. In addition, there are also some logic problems here about figuring out quite easily what&apos;s going on involving the ghost trying to lure and kidnap her away from the house any way she can but not being subtle about it. This is most evident in the inane decision-making skills of the mother, barely able to recognize what&apos;s happening to her daughter as she&apos;s obviously terrified but doesn&apos;t do anything about it. As well, there&apos;s also the rather underwhelming and unappealing CGI present here, managing to make a lot of the scenes look obvious and detrimentally fake that borders on laughable at times. Overall, it&apos;s not enough to truly drag this down completely but it does come down somewhat from what it could&apos;ve been.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Violence, Language, and children-in-jeopardy.",

Really sad to see good gems in the rough like this getting trashed by people that frankly shouldn&apos;t be reviewing movies, maybe I&apos;m an elitist, I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;m sorry, if you couldn&apos;t follow the story of The Abandoned, I really don&apos;t know what to say.\n\nThis movie is kept from being a top tier creepy movie simply by pacing issues, that&apos;s probably my main problem with it which drags it&apos;s score into the 7 range (might as well be a 10 for the amount of drek horror made since the mid 90&apos;s). This movie has impeccable atmosphere, the kind you can cut through with a knife which is oh so important for any great haunted house film. The atmosphere itself was incredibly creepy, the director should have let the audience just stew in that a bit before getting right to the point so to speak within minutes of walking into the house, it really lessens the impact of the imagery and the antagonists in this movie, but doesn&apos;t destroy it by any means.\n\nWhat stood out the most to me is that it was a very original idea (as far as i know, I have never seen anything quite like it) and like The Baby&apos;s room, I love wildly original takes on my favorite horror genre, the haunted house movie. It&apos;s deliciously dark without relying on cheap gore, but if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for, there&apos;s some incredibly brutal and disturbing scenes in it. The story and acting and characters are good enough to be very compelling but at the same time, I think a little more character development couldn&apos;t have hurt. yet we have people screaming &quot;TOO SLOW TOO BORING&quot; and 1 starring it so this is why character development is sadly all but dead in horror movies.\n\nThe imagery and photography was fantastic, sound appropriately creepy if severely overdone at times but only a few times.\n\nJust see it. Even if it doesn&apos;t scare you like it didn&apos;t scare me (i can count the movies on one hand that have achieved this, this is the holy grail of horror for me.), it&apos;s very creepy and quite unnerving and just an all around enjoyable flick. Definitely gets the thumbs up from me.",

The inner most planets had formed the Alliance, and conquered the outer Independent planets in a destructive war. Mal (Nathan Fillion) and his ragtag band of former rebels are living on the edge of survival. Simon had bought his way on board and rescued sister River from a government facility. She&apos;s a secret experiment with psychic powers and hidden memories of a deadly government secret.\n\nThis is the follow up to the short-lived cult TV show Firefly. Although it&apos;s not absolutely necessary to know the TV show to understand the movie, it would help to get the feel of the group dynamics. The relationships are what gives the movie its emotions. The characters are pretty easily decipherable. Nevertheless, their backstories would help.\n\nThis has the Joss Whedon touches. It has the fast talking inside jokes of a Scooby gang. That&apos;s what makes this fun. The CGI is not the absolute top rate, but he makes up for it with inventive energy. The random craziness of the big space battle is something that Star Wars can only aspire to. In fact, Mal is Han Solo. Imagine if Star Wars centered on Han Solo, and you&apos;ve got this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ghost of the Needle&quot; is the compelling and taunt story of Jacob (Brian Avenet-Bradley), a talented photographer who enjoys injecting young women with drugs and then photographing their dead bodies.  His agent, Richard (Greg Thompson), is frustrated that Jacob won&apos;t sell any of his work, even after a nice commission to photograph a bridge at a particular time of day.\n\n Jacob manages to find a new girl, Aimee (Cheri Christian), while photographing the bridge.  But after this murder, funny things start to occur in Jacob&apos;s studio.\n\nI&apos;d say more, but that would just ruin the experience of viewing this incredible piece of cinema.\n\nThe film is directed and edited with confidence by Avenet-Bradley, and shot with skill by his wife, Laurence Avenet-Bradley.  No shot is superfluous or poorly staged.  The script, done by Avenet-Bradley is a refreshing one, choosing to center on the killer as the primary character.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting that Jacob almost becomes the sympathetic &quot;hero&quot; of the film as Avenet-Bradley surrounds Jacob with unlikable people, including his slimy agent, a nasty detective/bounty hunter (Kevin Bartolomucci), and Steve, the wealthy man (Jack Harkleroad) who is commissioning Jacob to photograph the bridge.  The only truly likable person Jacob meets is Laura (Leigh Hill), Steve&apos;s wife.\n\nNone of these people have done anything wrong or even given you a reason not to like them, and yet I found myself viewing Jacob the most likable fellow, despite the fact that he&apos;s serial killer.  It&apos;s a refreshing shift from having the strong hero battling the interesting psycho to focusing only on how the killer is viewing this world around him.\n\nAvenet-Bradley&apos;s Jacob is a sullen and nearly emotionless man.  It works. &quot;It&apos;s technical,&quot; Jacob says early on.  And it is.  The film makes a point of showing the audience just how methodical Jacob is in his photography, with a wonderfully done sequence of photo development by hand (Reminded me of &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;&apos;s explanation of how of one-hour places do your snapshots).  The victims are picked purely by chance.  Jacob then goes through the process of propping them up, photographing them, and the developing and framing the pictures.  The method has meaning for him, not so much the result.\n\nThompson&apos;s Richard is a very Hollywoodish agent, all smiles with customers, slave driver with Jacob.  His line delivery is dead-on and wonderful, injecting deadpan humor into a very serious, unfunny film.\n\n The real gem is Leigh Hill as Laura.  I was a bit iffy concerning the performance when Laura first appears, but by the end, I was sold on Hill. She plays Laura with serious inner-strength and a quiet, loving power that nicely balances Jacob&apos;s technical methodicalness.\n\nI&apos;m not a person that gets scared at films that have tons of blood, lots of gore, etc.  I&apos;m more about atmosphere and creating an air of suspense and danger.  &quot;Ghost of the Needle&quot; does a fine job of doing these things. Laurence Avenet-Bradley&apos;s camera work goes a long way to achieving this by weaving in and out of the truly spooky warehouse with wonderful dolly shots throughout the film.  Additionally, Mark Lee Fletcher&apos;s score is eerie and haunting, only increasing the strength of the film&apos;s thriller capabilities.\n\n&quot;Ghost of the Needle&quot; is a fine, compelling suspense story with fine acting and technical work.  This is a little film that deserves a big theatrical break.",

It was a real consciousness raiser for me.\n\nMy biases notwithstanding, this movie is as a hypnotic account of a confusing episode of an even more confusing time. It has the task of representing the mindset of the times, the mindsets, I should say, while still making it into a spontaneous narrative.\n\nI&apos;m not an expert so I cannot vouch for the authenticity of any of this, but I feel I can believe all of it. There is a tendency for us to demarcate history from real life. A million deaths is a statistic as Stalin said. But here I really feel history and the lives of regular people converge in a devastating way.\n\nAt its heart I suppose the movie is a mystery. Not so much who-done-it but a why-did-it. I really felt while I was watching, all the chaos and threat that leads to tragedy while still feeling baffled and disorientated throughout. It feels like a documentary. The dialogue is spontaneous but still rich with nuance. The cinematography is candid and even shaky, giving it an often hypnotic, Blair Witch quality.\n\nA movie to never forget.",

The thoughtful script maintained a dry whimsical tone with moments of sadness.\n\nThe interesting trope of not showing any of the men&apos;s faces keeps the film firmly focused on the women&apos;s stories while allowing a glimpse at how several of the characters relate to men. Acting, shooting and script were all excellent and the music was tasteful and well performed and then incorporated into the plot.\n\nIt had a possibly slightly oversaccharous, feelgood ending, but by that time I had been won over by the characters and could cope with the sweet send off.",

      "reviewBody": "First, I&apos;m sure everyone commenting on this film has seen the documentary on Peckinpah, and the comments made by the film critics regarding this film. If I may quote one of the critics, and I&apos;m sure you all agree &quot;It&apos;s the one film of Peckinpah&apos;s that everyone tries to imitate&quot;. Even Tarantino does to some degree. I have issues with Quentin Tarantino from a cinematic and artistic point of view, but that is another review. Warren Oates&apos; performance was flawless, as he actually assumes the identity Of Sam Peckinpah as a gesture of appreciation for gracing him with his first starring vehicle.\n\nWarren Oates was taking Sam&apos;s journey for him, as Sam looked from behind the lens. This movie was Peckinpah at his best and his worst at the same time. The old Peckinpah themes are there; Mexico is the final frontier, where one can continue to be what he once was in a changing world, but eventually Mexico begins to change as well. As I said in my review of &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; (be sure to check it out, and get back to me)progress is the main antagonist in the lives of Peckinpah&apos;s characters.\n\nJunior Bonner and Bennie (Oates&apos; Character) have a common foe, the twentieth century, which is why we find Bennie in Mexico. The chance to improve his situation, and establish a solid relationship with his hooker girlfriend (played with tough sincerity by Isela Vega) arrives at a time in Bennie&apos;s life when he least expects it, but it&apos;s not as easy as it is set out to be. All he has to do is bring this head to &quot;El Hefe&quot;, and at the last minute BAM!! Bennie grows a conscience. Along the way he loses his woman, and then just goes nuts, thus revealing &quot;The Diseased Soul of Sam Peckinpah&quot;.\n\nMy favorite scene is actually the picnic, where Elita and Bennie discuss their future. Elita begs Bennie to ask her to marry her, he does and she begins to weep. The simple fact that he says it is a tender moment, and shows how the slightest thing can arouse a woman&apos;s emotions. Jerry Fielding&apos;s musical score, which successfully created the mood and atmosphere for &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (my all time favorite Peckinpah film) is present, but very muted. Still, this may be the best scene of the film.\n\nSam Peckinpah finally had complete control to dictate the direction of this film; Free from the money men, and left to his own devices in Mexico where he felt at home. A lot of people say that Pat Garret and Billy the Kid was the last Peckinpah masterpiece, but I think Alfredo Garcia was the last one. It throws you off at the beginning with the horses, then all of a sudden a Corvette screeches by; This is the paradox that really signifies that &quot;The West&quot; is over, bringing Sam Peckinpah and his love for the west full circle.\n\nThe critics literally hated this film, but 30 years later because of it we have a Martin Scorcese, a Robert Rodriguez, and a Quentin Tarantino (yeah) to name a few, as well as achieving underground cult status. I&apos;m proud to call &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; one of my favorite films."

Soon the paper&apos;s owner is murdered and Perry finds himself the prime suspect.\n\nThis is the fourth in WB&apos;s Perry Mason film series and the last starring Warren William. If you&apos;re new to this series but are familiar with Perry Mason from either the books or the Raymond Burr TV show, you will be surprised by what you find here. This is Perry Mason in name only. The character in this series is pretty much your typical &apos;30s detective, smooth with the ladies and quick with a wisecrack. Pretty Claire Dodd returns as Della Street after being replaced by Genevieve Tobin in the third film. Eddie Acuff is Perry&apos;s right hand stooge, Spudsy Drake. For his part, Warren William is...well, more of the usual Warren William screen persona that I&apos;ve seen in many films from the period. He&apos;s enjoyable although, as I&apos;ve said, nothing like the Perry Mason I grew up watching reruns of on TV. It&apos;s an entertaining B detective film. Nothing more memorable than that but a good time-passer.",

The movie boasts great production values for such a small project.\n\n The story has been modified and updated from the original source material, but not to the detriment of the spirit of Jane Austen.  There were a lot of in-jokes to Austen fans--keep an eye out for the address on the mailbox! The script mixes witty dialogue with physical comedy--something for both senses of humor.\n\nSomeone finally made a local movie with decent actors.  Kam Heskin is a great Elizabeth.  Jane (Sola) is adorable and her counterpart Charles (Gourley) is just delicious--I could eat him up.  Darcy (Seale) is appropriately heart-breaking and dashing.  Lydia and Kitty were hysterical.\n\n I loved the parallels between 19th Century England and modern Mormons in America.    This is a movie in which the characters happens to be LDS, its not a movie about being LDS.  That aspect was very refreshing.  Are all the characters perfect depictions of model LDS youth?  No!  And neither are most of the people in my ward.  However, I recognized all the characters.\n\nIf you go into this movie expecting Singles Ward you might be disappointed. Or you might be thrilled.  Pride &amp; Prejudice is infinatly smarter than its Mollywood predecessors.  I&apos;ve heard both sides from people.  Those who loved Singles Ward may think that nothing will hold a candle to it.  Then there are the people like me, who liked Singles Ward, but are ready for a movie that is more intelligent and has better production values.\n\nIn all I can&apos;t wait to see Pride &amp; Prejudice again."

      "reviewBody": "I expected good things from this film as I tend to admire directors and screenwriters who take a visually arresting premise and manipulate it in order to prompt self reflection in the audience (The Elephant Man for example). In addition, I am a big fan of Travolta and the role seemed an artistically sound one for him to undertake. Initially, the widespread symbolism is interesting and inventive, yet becomes overbearing relatively quickly, and to me it seemed that the director underestimated his audience&apos;s perception and continually rammed home his point with the subtlety of Dolph Lundgren.\n\nThe film ultimately left me frustrated because I thought the idea was a good one but the story simply wasn&apos;t multi-faceted enough to be engaging. Aside from the characters played by Travolta and Belafonte, most of the supporting cast was very underwritten, particularly the families of both men. However, the performances were very good, and I thought Belafonte conveyed the defeatism and inherent arrogance of his role particularly well.\n\nOverall though, I thought this was pseudo-art: it masqueraded as a deep and meaningful examination of the social relevance of race, but ended up as a very simplistic story disguised by delusions of self worth.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie when it was first shown on a Los Angeles TV station that had licensed a number of big-budget MGM movies for a once-a-week event.  I was in my mid-teens at the time and had a part-time job at a supermarket in Pacific Palisades, where my family lived.  Gladys Cooper, who had a supporting role in &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; and who gave her usual British-sterling performance (as a French matriarch), was a frequent customer at that store and she seemed to always choose the checkout line where I was working.  (Must have liked the careful way I packed her groceries!)  I usually helped her out with her purchases to her top-down 1956 Thunderbird roadster.  On the afternoon after &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; had been shown the previous evening, I did more than exchange the usual pleasantries with Ms. Cooper and mentioned having enjoyed the film and, in particular, the eloquence of her deathbed scene.  She graciously thanked me and admitted to watching the film, too (for the first time, by the way), and that she had also enjoyed it.  &quot;It really wasn&apos;t bad!&quot; she said, as she started up her convertible and waved goodbye.  When weather permitted, and it did rather frequently in that southern California town, she usually looked like she&apos;d come in to do her grocery shopping, in tennis shorts and a sleeveless blouse, after spending an afternoon gardening in what, no doubt, was as much of a showstopper as the many roles in which she had excelled. For a woman who was in her late sixties at the time, she radiated a most charismatic energy.  A great lady whom I shall always remember most fondly."

      "reviewBody": "Yellow Earth by Chen Kai-ge (Farewell My Concubine, Life on a String) was the first film of the so-called fifth generation of filmmakers who introduced a new aesthetic and social awareness to Chinese cinema. It is set just before World War II in Shaanxi province in Northern China near the Yellow River, an area referred to as gian shan wan he (thousands of hills and ten folds more gullies). Based on Ke Lai&apos;s novel, &quot;Echo in the Deep Valley&quot;, the film shows the struggle of the peasants in the area known for its unyielding harshness and the folk traditions they drew on to express their anguish. As the film begins, cinematographer Zhang Yimou creates a feeling of desolation with panoramic shots of the vast landscape as a soldier from the Communist Eighth Route Army, Gu Qing (Wang Xueyin), walks over the barren hills to a small village. He says he is there to collect folk songs for the army to use so that &quot;the people will know why they are suffering, why their women are beaten, and why they should rise up&quot;.\n\n Comrade Gu stays with a poor family that includes 47-year old widowed father (Tan Tuo), his 13-year old daughter Cuiqiao (Xue Bai), and almost mute son Hanhan (Liu Quiang). Rather than relying on traditional narrative to convey the film&apos;s message, Kai ge uses long static shots and songs of the people to express mood and tone. The father has become embittered with his life of constant deprivation and sings &quot;Life is hard for seasonal workers. They are hired in January, dismissed in October&quot;. Conditions are tough and the farmers pray for rain to alleviate the drought but there is no rain. At a wedding, the serving of wooden fish figures covered with sauce underscores the lack of adequate food. The film also dramatizes the sorry condition of women, showing how they had to carry heavy buckets of water on their backs for miles, and how they were forced into arranged marriages at a very young age. \n\nGu is seemingly confident of the fight he is waging. He lets the family know that in the South, there are no longer any arranged marriages and tells Cuiqiao about women who cut their hair, fight against the Japanese, and can read and write. She hears about her older sister&apos;s unhappy marriage and does not want to endure the same fate. &quot;Of all us poor folk,&quot; she sings, &quot;girls are the saddest.&quot; Cuiqiao is infatuated with Gu and wants to leave home and join the Army 200 miles away in Yanan. She knows that if she stays she will be forced to marry an older man in an arranged ceremony. When Gu leaves to return to camp, he promises to return in April. Promises alone, however, cannot change Cuiqiao&apos;s growing feeling of entrapment or the terrible consequences that follow. In its heartbreaking portrayal of people caught in lives of &quot;quiet desperation&quot; that even Communist ideas or marching songs cannot redeem, Yellow Earth speaks a universal language."

A popular TV singer has an emergency landing of her small plane in a remote village in the German alps. While waiting to be rescued (with the improvement in communications, the argument couldn&apos;t be credible in a contemporary movie), she becomes friendly with the local people, falls in love with the village singer (a young, handsome yodeler who is also a woodcutter) and eventually takes him to the big city (Munich in this case) so he can start a career as a singer. His village girlfriend has no alternative but to go to the city to rescue him. There are many interesting things in this movie. One is an early look at the world of television (which is shown here as a new medium taking over German homes). The beautiful color photography allows also you to see life in 1950s Germany as if one would be watching a lost world. Upbeat and cheery, this movie belong to a kind of film (the genre of popular comedies made in Germany in the 1950s) that have been frowned upon by critics. Yet I find them much more appealing than the ponderous, pretentious German films of the 60s and 70s.",

They go on a date to a remote gorge, she breathes in fumes wafting out from underground, and grows... and GROWS!\n\nCostello rushes back to town to ask her uncle (played by Gale Gordon) for help; when he tells Gordon &quot;Oh, she&apos;s big... she&apos;s really BIG... you&apos;ve gotta help us!&quot; Gordon gets the wrong idea, forces Costello to marry her... THEN he finds out what &quot;big&quot; meant when he comes to visit.  Costello spends most of the movie using his inventions to try to restore Provine to normal.\n\nIt&apos;s a good light sci-fi comedy; Provine plays a gentle (if reluctant) giantess, and she also looks cute in a sheet."

      "reviewBody": "The movie Armin Mueller-Stahl rather not talk about must on of the weirdest in german film history. Stylistically it borrows from Cinéma vérité and the Nouvelle Vague, content-wise it is a loyal justification of the building of the Berlin wall.\n\nThe story is a love triangle between loyal communist electrician Ulli (Mueller-Stahl) and his, corrupted by the west, foster brother Klaus (Ulrich Thein) working as a taxi driver in West Berlin. They both fall in love with postwoman Eva (Kati Székely). Ulli knows the regime is planning to build the wall and that will be the end of Klaus&apos; job, he tries to help him find his place in communist Germany. Klaus gets Eva pregnant, Ulli goes to visit his comrades in Cuba. Upon his return Eva tells him that Klaus wants to flee East Germany. Ulli hinders his escape attempt and gets shot by a border guard. Klaus goes to jail. Once released from hospital Ulli and Eva will bring up the child loyal to the party.\n\nThe weird thing is that it tells this extremely communist loyal story, with the means of modern and western film styles. But unlike those films who often feature characters in varying shades of grey, this features purely black and white characters. Klaus is all bad he is lazy, untrustworthy and violent and so of course he can not understand why the wall needs to be build. Ulli is all good and loyal who does not even need to question the betrayal of his foster brother.\n\nFour years later director Frank Vogel had his own films banned in East Germany in the famous 1965 mass ban of East German films. He nonetheless later directed the episode &quot;Materna&quot; in the other more famous Berlin Wall justification movie &quot;Geschichten jener Nacht&quot;.",

Its political and social messages are unmistakable.\n\nThe film resonated strongly with the audience, judging by the many questions and comments from audience members, several of whom identified themselves as non-American. This film is an effective teaching tool and should be shown in school and every public library.",

A local party secretary (this is still the time when Poland was behind the iron curtain) has to face a mob of strikers protesting hefty increases in food prices by the central government. The embattled secretary decides at first to stick it out at the party&apos;s office instead of making the recommended hasty escape. Most of the footage is from the point of view of the party secretary. His thoughts and stratagems to deal with the protesters is done through voice-over. The confrontation between mob and the party leads to a tense, suspenseful situation.\n\nThis film reminded me of the political thrillers that were a trademark of director Costa Gravas. The difference here is that most of the action is limited to one location. The scenes of the mob surrounding the entrance to the party building are well done and convincing. During those mob scenes, there are inserts that break up the main action to explain who are and what happened later to some of the protesters. Didactic as those may be, they end up as mere distractions. Fortunately each is short and you are quickly back into gripping uncertainty.",

      "reviewBody": "The films of Wayne Wang are an acquired taste. His early films,such as &apos;Eat A Bowl Of Tea&apos;,&apos;Dim Sum:A Little Bit Of Heart&apos;,and his best known film &apos;The Joy Luck Club&apos; are meditations on the Asian lifestyle in the United States. If your tastes are aimed at explosions,car chases, mindless teen sex romps,bathroom humour,then avoid Wang&apos;s films at all costs. If you like a well written screenplay that doesn&apos;t dwell on car chases,explosions,toilet humour &amp; all the rest that make for just another descent into the cinematic sewer,then you just may get your groove on with the films of Wayne Wang. Here,a elderly Chinese widower comes to the U.S. to visit his adult daughter (and try to run her life), while adjusting to the American experience (or at least trying to adjust). Toss in an attempted friendship with a widow from Iran,mix in some long hidden family secrets, and we have ourselves the formula for a real human drama. The cast,mainly made up of unknowns,make this slowly paced (but never boring)drama an alternative to the formulaic Hollywood garbage that always seems to be the centre of attention at the local multiplexes. No rating,but outside of the discreet mention of extra marital affairs,nothing to offend here.",

In somewhat of a &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; parody it involves a mama and daddy pig who have a little pig son, and it&apos;s set on Christmas Eve. All is quite not even a creature is stirring except the big bad wolf who comes down the chimney! And the short is clever with wit and funny chase scenes as the wolf dresses up as Santa to try and lure the little pig son to gifts on Christmas Eve! Never fear this little pig is smart the big bad wolf is outmatched and outsmarted. As Mamma pig big gets a surprise fur coat with some wolf hid from the little pig son! Overall well done Christmas cartoon watch it before the holidays!",

Pete of course tries to get Alice to give him her crossword puzzle, but Julius the cat comes and sends Pete gliding over the sea and landing onto a buoy after a fight.  Alice finally solves the puzzle by filling in THE END.  I am not too interested in the silent era of Disney&apos;s animation, but I do enjoy the Alice Comedies more from a historical perspective."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ace In the Hole,&quot; which used to turn up on local TV as &quot;The Big carnival,&quot; was far head of its time. It wasn&apos;t very successful and its cynicism shocked people.\n\nAlong comes Andy Warhol almost two decades later with his notion of &quot;fifteen minutes of fame&quot; and everyone buys that concept. It&apos;s not quite the same as the concept of this. Nor is that of the very popular &quot;Network,&quot; which came even later. But the premise here is that reporter Kirk Douglas will literally jeopardize a man&apos;s life in order to get a series of big newspaper stories. And does anyone today doubt that such things happen? Wilder was often cynical, though here it is to the most meaningful end. &quot;the Fortune Cookie&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; are cynical also and they are both fun but this one makes a very trenchant point and they do not.\n\nThe acting is superb. Kirk Douglas gave many brilliant performances. This is one of them. The trailer included in the DVD I just saw crows that with this Jan Sterling will be immediately elevated to the top rank of female stars. That never happened but she is excellent here, as generally elsewhere.\n\nThe interviews of Wilder by Cameron Crowe tell a funny story about the genesis of one of her lines. I&apos;d better not quote it; so get that book. It&apos;s very entertaining, informative, and touching.\n\nWilder was one of =this country&apos;s great directors. This will probably never be one of his most popular movies but I&apos;d certainly rank it as one of his best.",

Eisenstein&apos;s transition into sound required a total reevaluation of his intentions as a director, and it seems as if Pudovkin didn&apos;t recognize the need for this consideration. But this is still a worthwhile film, especially when seen after &quot;Petersbourg.&quot; The layering of the political content is admirable for getting it&apos;s self-criticism past the censors. But yes, the sound is sloppy and the magic of his silents is audibly swept away. It would seem that he would also reevaluate his own intentions for his later sound films, and this may have been a necessary part of that development.\n\n3 out of 5 - Some strong elements",

      "reviewBody": "This movie caused a huge controversy in Hungary, and I don&apos;t understand why. Of course the integration of the gypsy minority is a big problem here, but Benedek Fliegauf&apos;s film has got nothing to say about it. The director doesn&apos;t have a message, he just portrays the life of a family, he doesn&apos;t want to deal with any issues regarding the gypsies or racism. I mean, for example Crash was able to show 6-7 sides of racism, Fliegauf doesn&apos;t even wants to show one. The Hungarians majority are racist in this movie for no reason, but in one scene, there are gypsies attacking innocent people (also for no reason), so I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s one sided, but the main problem is that everything happens for no reason, revealing how shallow this film is. And because there are no thoughts to fill this movie with, most of the scenes are a bit overdrawn. The lighting and the acting seems amateur, but the overall quality of the movie is good.\n\nSo by &quot;shallow&quot; I don&apos;t want to mean it&apos;s bad (that&apos;s why I gave it a 7 out of 10), but this movie seems dumb compared to movies like Crash or Tropa de Elite."

Film is based in different short stories about love, couples, human attitude towards your workmates, etc. Psycology and mentality of such moment can be discovered reading under lines of dialogs. The movie is in black and white but you can learn a lot about places and dress of that moment of time. As the duration of each story is about 10 to 15 minutes the movie draw my attention. As in 1960s there was some kind of censorship and ingenuity in the Argentine Society this movie is influenced by this two things, although can not be classified in that way. On the contrary, the director tries to show controverted themes (such as divorce, which was approved in 1985) In my view there is some influence of nouvelle vague in this movie.\n\nHoracio Buenos Aires, 2011",

      "reviewBody": "Like Fejos&apos; LONESOME, this film shows a creative imagination combined with an undeveloped story sense and a finite talent.  The events in the simple plot are telegraphed, repeated, and told very slowly.  Poor Marie, hanging out clothes on the line in the front yard at midnight, is offered candy by the fiance of the lady of the house and, presto, comes the dawn. (Presumably the seduction or rape occurred right in the barren front yard, next to the road.)  Marie is cast out, and can find little work.  Finally, she finds herself at the door of a tavern frequented by prostitutes, facing the ferocious woman who runs the place.  She is given a menial job and finds a family in the girls and a mother-figure in the manager.  The character of this woman--strong, hard, inexpressive, but compassionate and just--and the actress who plays her, is by far the most complex and interesting aspect of the film.  Marie suffers further at the hands of a group of do-gooders, cardboard figures as Fejos&apos; villains tend to be.  Finally she goes to a ridiculous, saccharine, kitschy heaven, where she again finds herself washing the floors.  It&apos;s hard to know just how much Fejos has his tongue in his cheek with this final sequence.  In fact, it&apos;s hard to pin Fejos down in general.  Much of the time he seems simple-minded, even dull, but then he&apos;ll come up with an original visual idea or an unexpectedly well-observed moment or character that makes you think he has something after all."

Jeremy and his wife Sinead excel as the older couple in this as do their younger selves portrayed by different actors. There is a wonderful love story threading through the whole movie and you are not too sure where it is heading.  Jeremy plays a history teacher in the US, I understand that the book had him teaching in England where the first half of the movie takes place.  Waterland refers to land that has been reclaimed from the ocean and is extremely flat with streams and water running through it. He is married to his childhood sweetheart and they have both been traumatized by an event that took place while they were in their teens. There is an aura of sadness around them 20 years later as they arrive at the doorway to middle age and the long held pain within the wife starts to manifest itself in strange ways. I see the waterland of their youth as allegorical in this, the reclaiming of their lives from their childhood tragedy. Some of the history lessons were a little awkwardly done, I found them forced and a key plot twist I could see from a mile away, but on the whole this movie captured my attention and I gave it an 8 out of 10.  It would not be to everybody&apos;s taste.",

Hurricane pulls up perfectly preserved dinosaur bodies from the ocean floor; Tyrannosaur and Brontosaurus, and a caveman. Lightning strikes, dinosaurs come to lift and terrorize bad actors. Caveman comes to life also, befriends kid, and ends up riding the brontosaurus.\n\nI saw this years ago, and remember it as being kinda cool. Always remembered the caveman trying to eat plastic fruit, then wondering into the bathroom and flushing the toilet. The FX were OK, I guess. Think they used puppets, and some stop-motion. Final confrontation with the Tyrannosaur vs a tractor was cool. Kind of a precursor for Ripley&apos;s duel with the queen in &quot;Aliens.&quot;\n\n&quot;Dinosaurus!&quot; certainly won&apos;t make you forget &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; but it&apos;s an enjoyable little movie.",

Even though the killings were better in this installment, they were not anything to brag about. One thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters.  They changed emotions suddenly, and some of their lines were just dumb.  For instance one character quoted, &quot; You better have some R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or you&apos;ll find out what is means to me.&quot;  Once I heard that line I figured it was of the worst I&apos;ve ever heard.  Another thing that I hated about this movie was the fact it was too short.  A successful movie has to go more than one hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2.  If Full Moon makes part 3 of Killjoy, that would be stooping to the lowest level they can possibly go.  Overall, 1 of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "I liked this enough to tell you in the first sentence that it would have been a candidate for one of only two 4-star ratings I give per year.\n\nIf you are an average viewer, you will be put off by the apparent narrative incoherence, the seeming lack of center and the childish nature of some of the devices. That&apos;s all fair enough. But let me point you to two things that make it for me.\n\nThe first is that it is inherently cinematic. It makes about as much sense when the sound is turned off. Indeed I watched the whole thing through this way once and it actually makes more sense. There&apos;s lots of cinematic nesting: movies about movies; videos, narratives and disguises within. There&apos;s lots of causality denoted visually. You will find scores of quotes from other films, many more than those &quot;parody&quot; teen movies. And you&apos;ll discover many of your favorite intelligent but not famous actors.\n\nThat would be enough for me, but there&apos;s something else. In fact, though the story is confusing, deliberately made so through how it unfolds, it does make complete sense. It makes as much sense as, say, &quot;The Matrix.&quot; I wish it didn&apos;t, but there you are. But its the way the story slips about that is pretty wonderful. You see, a narrative works by the way the pieces connect. \n\nUsually we don&apos;t have to work because the way the pieces connect is the way they happen in real life: the causal flow of the narrative telling is the same as in the story. But the detective story, and modern noir changed that and now we have a variety of causal connections that can glue the bits together. Even these you don&apos;t normally notice unless the writer  as here  makes the shifts between bits cover a greater distance than usual. \n\nPay attention to this. Greenaway uses reference to number sequence. Barney uses progress through the sexual encounter, clever that. Lynch provides these discontinuities by having characters shift selves  a technique of discovery. Joyce  who in a way is the gold standard because he reified this sort of art through cognitive plumbing connection  depends on notational congruence. All these are exciting as getout in the hands of their masters.\n\nBut this is different, more rooted in noir, in cinema. These elements are connected in ways that only read in film. \n\nHere&apos;s what I mean: film has evolved a set of notions we call noir. These capture two worlds; the world of the story where the laws of the universe seem to be deliberately arranged by strange occurrences, &quot;mistakes&quot; and coincidences to play havoc with key characters. Then there is the (usually implied) second world where those laws are manipulated and we the viewers sit. In almost all noir films, this effect only occurs in the long form, meaning that it is apparent when seem over the whole story.\n\nNow look here. For all intents, there is no long form here, just a sequence of medium- sized events, each of which contain rather than follow the previous ones. This form was pioneered (I believe) by Altman. The narrative glue of the whole is how the segments slip against one another. We have &quot;Magnolia&quot; that plays with this concept as well, this slipperage. Its the connection that conveys the world. Its subtle and homeopathically powerful as a result.\n\nNow this. Its another step forward in that the connection between elements involves changes in the way the world works. Each shift is not just between story segments that don&apos;t make sense, they don&apos;t make sense BECAUSE of the nature of the transitions. Many of these transitions involve a change in the laws of the universe. Its as if you were playing chess as a chesspiece, and the rules of the game changed according to the patterns of the pieces on the board. The whole thing would make sense afterward when seem as a whole, but the chessmen will be baffled.\n\nWhat this does is build an ordinary noir with the two worlds: story, and gods. But it cleverly puts the viewer on the chessboard as someone at the mercy of the rules. Its no accident that the inspiration is Philip K Dick (who invented this sort of reverse introspection), that the key magical plot device is the magically named &quot;fluid karma,&quot; and that the mascot is Bai Ling, who was our Béatrice Dalle surrogate for a while.\n\nI want to give this a four, but I do think that the two others from this year are more important.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

A little over two hours later, I was still shivering and shaking. Robert Zemeckis has taken what is undoubtedly a good (though maybe somewhat predictable) screenplay, and has lifted it to the level of Hitchcockian genius. My eyes bugged out, my skin crawled, my breath got short, and I couldn&apos;t have torn myself away even if the Publisher&apos;s Clearing House Prize Patrol was at my door.\n\nAlong with a great story and masterful directing, this movie features the superb performance of Michelle Pfeiffer. Ambivalent about her acting skills in the past, I am now a full-fledged Pfeiffer fan. Harrison Ford is certainly adequate, and this role is a refreshing change for him, but Michelle steals the show.\n\nGood ghost stories are few and far between. Even &quot;Stir Of Echoes&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, fine films that they are, don&apos;t compare to the perfect blend of soundtrack, plot twists, camerawork and performance that make up &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;. If goosebumps are your thing, don&apos;t miss this one."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard not to smile as you watch this film play itself out. There are just too many fine actors and top notch performances contained in this film for it to be anything but outstanding. Howard Hawks knows just how to harness this story and give each actor room enough to strut his stuff.\n\nJohn Wayne plays a hired gun who comes to the aid of a drunken sheriff played to perfection by Robert Mitchum. By Wayne&apos;s side is a young man (James Caan) packing a nasty scatter-gun, and also at their disposal is a grizzled Indian fighter deputy (Arthur Hunnicutt). The four do battle with an evil land owner (Ed Asner), his hired gun (Christopher George), and several other gunslingers looking for trouble. A rival family of landowners named the MacDonalds are being pressured by Asner and his cronies. Wayne and Co. take their side, and all hell breaks loose in El Dorado.\n\nThe film is crisply paced, well-written, and the acting as good as you might expect. Even actors like Caan and Asner who might seem out of their element fit right in and hold their own. Wayne is as watchable as ever. It&apos;s a treat just to hear him say the word &quot;Mississippi&quot; every time he refers to Caan. Mitchum has the more demanding of the two lead roles, and it&apos;s no wonder Wayne wanted that role for himself. The toughest thing our heroes are faced with is sobering him up as he has become the laughing stock of the town he is supposed to protect. Arthur Hunnicutt, as Mitchum&apos;s deputy, seems to get a lot of the good lines and more than proves his worth when things get tough. Another person who stands out is Michele Carey who portrays one of the MacDonald clan. I&apos;d never really heard of her before, but the woman is stunningly beautiful. She plays a resourceful woman out to kick some Asner butt.\n\nBetween the numerous shootouts, there are wonderful scenes where you can tell the stars are just happy to stand together in front of the camera. There are a few scenes that really weren&apos;t beaten to death by the genre and actually look original. A shootout involving church bells was something I hadn&apos;t seen before, though I&apos;m hardly an expert in western lore. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to find that someone had done it before, but it really worked in this film. Also, it was neat to see Caan blow some of the bad guys to shreds with his shotgun. That was an under-utilized weapon in old western films. His brief impersonation of a Chinaman is bound to offend some, but it&apos;s actually quite entertaining.\n\nIf you love a good western, you must not miss El Dorado. Even if you don&apos;t normally watch them, you might also find it more than worth your time.\n\n9 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",

That&apos;s truly awful enough for a start, but the director goes even further with lameness as throwing in various right-wing/patriotic lines in such already disastrous mix. There&apos;s lots of urban &quot;humor&quot; combined with suggestive nationalist pseudo-mythology and there&apos;s so many desperate tries with even more fails at giving this garbage some kind of social commentary value. There&apos;s some people who praise it for it&apos;s camp value, but guess what? There&apos;s no fun, the movie just plods from fail to fail. The acting is so forgettable and unconvincing, as there&apos;s not even a single scene with deep or even real emotions or expressiveness, so the characters are defined just visually. Cool camera and professional mainstream production can&apos;t save this movie, as it&apos;s totally dire and pointless in itself.",

Among her feats was establishing a children&apos;s theater in the West Bank city of Jenin during the 80s. Using old footage, Juliano Mer returns to the refugee camp after his mother&apos;s death and after a devastating Israel Defense Forces operation, to check up on the kids who attended the drama group - Arna&apos;s Children, who have grown up under Israeli occupation. Some joined militant groups, went on suicide missions or were killed while defending their home. Though highly political, the film does not take sides and is not dogmatic, just humane and real.",

      "reviewBody": "In Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion, Bud and Lou head to Algieria to find a wrestler named Abdullah who left them high and dry and owing a mobster quite a bit of money. Once there, the boys get mixed up with Sheik Hamud El Khalid (Douglas Dumbrille) and draw his ire at a slave auction. In their attempt to escape, Bud and Lou inadvertently sign-up for the French Foreign Legion. Things only get worse when they learn that their Sergeant is in cahoots with the Sheik. Now how are they going to get back to Brooklyn?\n\nAs a general rule, I&apos;m a fan of A&amp;C. Some of their movies (like Who Done It?, Hold that Ghost, and A&amp;C Meet Frankenstein) I consider to be true classics. Unfortunately, by the time the boys made A&amp;C in the Foreign Legion, much of their comedy had started to get tired and old. The movie has a &quot;been there, done that&quot; feel to a lot of it. For example, the &quot;Oui vs. We&quot; bit reminds me of several of A&amp;C&apos;s more classic routines. Or take a look at the scene with the fish and the false teeth. To me, it shows how desperate the boys were. It&apos;s completely ridiculous and not in the least bit funny. A solid cast, however, almost makes this movie worthwhile. Douglas Dumbrille and Patricia Medina are a lot of fun. However, even though I think Dumbrille makes for a perfect villain, he&apos;s about as Algerian as I am (which is none).\n\nFinally, one thing I really enjoyed about A&amp;C in the Foreign Legion was the chance to see some classic, old-school wrestlers. Wee Willie Davis vs. Tor Johnson! How cool is that?",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Cattle Queen of Montana&quot; was one of those &quot;tough old broad&quot; westerns that Barbara Stanwyck made during the 1950s.\n\n In this one Sierra Nevada Jones (Stanwyck), her father Pop Jones (Morris Ankrum) and their foreman Nat Collins (Chubby Johnson) have driven a herd of some 1,100 cattle up from Texas to settle in Montana. On their arrival, the herd is stampeded, Pop is killed and old Nat seriously wounded. The raid is led by renegade Blackfoot Natchakoa (Anthony Carouso) who is in league with local rancher McCloud (Gene Evans) to drive off any new ranchers arriving in the area.\n\n Into the picture comes gunfighter Farrell (Ronald Reagan) who signs on with McCloud. In the meantime &quot;good&quot; Blackfoot, Colorados (Lance Fuller) rescues Sierra and Nat and takes them to his village to recover. Gradually Sierra and Colorados become allies much to the chagrin of Colorado&apos;s girlfriend Starfire (Yvette Duguay) and Natchakoa.\n\n It turns out that Farrell is an army officer working under cover to discover who has been selling guns to the renegade Blackfeet. Well you knew that the clean cut Reagan would turn out to be a good guy didn&apos;t you? Anyway, Farrell aligns himself with Sierra and Colorados against the baddies and well, you know the rest.\n\n Director Alan Dwan gives us a beautifully photographed outdoor western. The VCI DVD has been digitally remastered to its original technicolor brilliance and this alone makes this a must see.\n\n Reagan is not very convincing as a ruthless gunfighter. He just doesn&apos;t come across as being mean enough. Stanwyck would play a number of similar roles in other westerns culminating with her long run on TV&apos;s &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. She&apos;s supposed to be a &quot;cattle queen&quot; here but doesn&apos;t have any cattle to speak of through most of the picture. Lance Fuller looks about as much like an Blackfoot Indian as I do. \n\n Also in the cast are Jack Elam and Myron Healey (who has a good scene with Stanwyck) as McCloud&apos;s henchmen, Hugh Sanders as Col. Carrington and a toothless Glenn Strange as the old Blackfoot Chief.\n\n Oddly enough most of the featured players (and Reagan) in this film would turn up in &quot;Tennessee&apos;s Partner&quot; the following year.",

Plus the new puppet, Torch, is awesome, along with all the original puppets doing what they do best...kill. In this film, Andre Toulon is brought back by the puppets to create more carnage. The storyline is not strong, the acting is not excellent, but it all works and the movie turns out to be pretty darn fun. Also some cool kills, and better gore than the first. The special effects are also excellent by David Allen&apos;s great effects crew, as David Allen also takes the director&apos;s chair on this film. If you like the original, you will also love this one, that is my logic.",

However, it&apos;s just another predictable thriller with flawed writing, average performances and not-so-flattering direction. I thought Farrell&apos;s James Clayton was supposed to be highly intelligent but his actions and reactions say otherwise. Likewise for Pacino&apos;s Walter Burke. It even seems outdated (I mean the CIA&apos;s headquarters have no hard drive? come on!) and on top of that technology is a significant part of the film but it just looks poor and obsolete. All three of the main performers, that is, Al Pacino, Bridget Moynahan and Colin Farrell are merely passable (yes, Pacino does his trademark shouting in the end but this time it&apos;s funny, unintentionally). The screenplay doesn&apos;t have enough grit to keep one engaged and the premise is too familiar and unbelievable. Anyway, &apos;The Recruit&apos; has nothing new to offer."

The plot was somewhat interesting, even though it&apos;s a typical &quot;dark future&quot;-plot that was so normal for the 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s. Gary Daniels is great in this movie. Of the people involved in this movie, he performs the best fighting of them all. I wonder why he isn&apos;t more well known among people. He should be right up there with van Damme (and far above Chuck Norris). The story in this movie also has a huge surprise to it, but I won&apos;t reveal it here. Watch the movie for yourself instead. Oh, how I just love fighting tournament movies!!",

Those beautiful expressive eyes!  Some have called Caron&apos;s portrayal `bratty&apos; but I think her Ella is not only convincing but also heartwarming.  Of course you are supposed to feel bad for this dirty little servant girl who is forced to take out the ashes, but instead of feeling sorry for herself, she continues to `act out&apos; against those who shun her, which I think gives her an appealingly strong character. The art direction and costuming are gorgeous!  Cinderella&apos;s massive pink and frilly `borrowed&apos; ball gown is exquisitely detailed with crystals and roses, and the glass slippers are pure magic! As a dancer I find the ballet dream sequences quite impressive and exciting to watch, but my one main problem with this film would have be casting Michael Wilding as a ballet dancer in the Princess Tehara dream sequence. Wilding is obviously not a dancer and I wished they had cast someone who could actually hold his own next to Caron&apos;s wonderful technique. Estelle Winwood as Mrs. Toquet is certainly worth the price of admission.and then some!  She is a funny, poignant and an amusing fairy godmother. Overall I find The Glass Slipper a wonderfully delightful diversion!",

      "reviewBody": "The movie takes place in 1989 when I was 15 years old and thanks to my clear memories, I must admit that the director managed to catch the atmosphere of the period. It was a time of big changes, the communist system collapsed, a &quot;great&quot; Hungarian leader died while a very important historical character, Imre Nagy, executed after the 1956 revolution, was finally given the honor of being buried. The setting is also excellent, the movie really looks as if it was shot in 89. For foreign viewers however this film doesn&apos;t say much because it&apos;s full hidden of jokes that only we understand, for example when the boys are sitting in a cab singing the horrible Opus song Life Is Life and at one point in the lyrics they sing Levelet Kaptam Life, because in the 80s nobody knew what the singer says there. What I missed was the lack of the depth of the characters and the plot wasn&apos;t very strong either but we mustn&apos;t complain because Moszkva Tér is a massive standout in contemporary Hungarian cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "Buddy Young, Jr. (Billy Crystal) is a talented comedian after forty years of struggling to reach the top. But Buddy can be unsympathetic man towards his comedy, his family and especially his long suffering brother/manager (David Paymer). Now Buddy has to make a choice between pushing forward to his dying career or making piece with the family, he&apos;s hurting.\n\nDirected by Billy Crystal (Forget Paris, Have a Nice Day, 61) made his directorial debut with this sometimes flawed but an genuinely touching and bittersweet comedy. Crystal is good in the lead role, since it&apos;s based on his comedy character routine but when Crystal plays the older version of his character. He&apos;s hardly convincing as the older Buddy, especially with the heavy make-up role. Which he looks like Carl Reiner than himself. Paymer and Julie Warner as Buddy&apos;s wife plays the older version of their characters more convincingly. Paymer received an Oscar Nomination for his terrific supporting performance.\n\nDVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has an interesting commentary track by Crystal, which Paymer joins him during the last fifty minutes of the movie. DVD also has three new featurettes with Crystal and Paymer, deleted scenes with introduction by the director, gag reel and the original theatrical trailer. This dramatic comedy has good supporting roles for Oscar-Winner:Helen Hunt and Ron Silver. Some amusing cameos by Jerry Orbach, Jerry Lewis and an young Adam Goldberg. This is one of the few underrated films of Billy Crystal, which he appears in. Written by Crystal, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. Which Ganz and Mandel wrote comedies like &quot;City Slickers 1 &amp; 2&quot;, &quot;EDTV&quot; and &quot;Greedy&quot;. (****/*****).",

Nice little PG-13 thriller. Odd viewing it for the first time after 20 years of it being released. I was mildly surprised to have never heard of it with big names (in the present) like Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy. Parts of it are kinda hollow. One sad attempt at a side story personalization is with a little girl on the flight. It was a typical early 2000s context focus on an irrelevant character. Honestly thinking now this seems almost like a way to get younger audience members involved in the story. There&apos;s a small degree of cheesiness. But as having been very much alive during the time period it made nostalgic for those days. Captured the feeling of airports and air travel that I&apos;ve grown up with. If there was more time given to the filmmaker to develop the second half of the story so it doesn&apos;t feel so rushed I would enjoy it much more.",

      "reviewBody": "When I heard about &quot;Hari Puttar&quot; for the first time, the title made me smile and hope for a nice Harry Potter parody or anything else even loosely based on Harry Potter. After all, there are numerous Harry Potter clones (&quot;Tanya Grotter&quot; in Russia, &quot;Porri Gatter&quot; in Belarus, &quot;Barry Trotter&quot; in Germany, etc.), so why couldn&apos;t there be a nice Bollywood version? Especially all the noise Time Warner made about it was all I needed to go and purchase it.\n\nWhat a waste! First of all, the movie has nothing in common with Harry Potter at all. On the contrary, it seems to be a loose remake of &quot;Home Alone&quot;. It is the story of a boy and a girl who were &quot;forgotten&quot; by their parents when they left for a trip, and now find themselves forced to defend the house against two clumsy bad guys. Obviously, the movie is supposed to be a comedy, but as such it has become a complete failure. The so-called humour is of the lowest standard. The scenario is a bad joke in itself, characterised by the silliest texts one can imagine, the story lacks a single good idea, and the acting is plain horrible. Even the presence of such capable actors as Jackie Shroff and Lilette Dubey cannot be of any help here.\n\nThis is one of the worst movies I&apos;ve ever seen. Yet, I don&apos;t even think Hari Puttar will ever make it into a cult movie of the &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; type. The movie is just embarrassing, not amusing at all, and poorly made. In fact, it is one of the rare movies that have made me angry.\n\nSomebody called it an &quot;average film but an entertaining one for kids&quot;. Well, if I were a kid, I would feel insulted by such low level. In my opinion, this movie is neither average nor entertaining; it&apos;s merely boring and utterly silly. Obviously, its creators don&apos;t have a clue regarding kids. As a matter of fact, Hari Puttar has only one advantage: for Bollywood standards, it is extremely short. But even then, 90 minutes were more than enough to make me yawn with relief when it was finally over.",

      "name": "With patience it is a very effective thriller whose plot problems are covered by a great director and a strong cast",
      "reviewBody": "Max thinks his day is looking up when he gets a beautiful fare who gives him a tip and her business card when she gets out. Resting on his laurels, Max nearly misses his next fare; Vincent, in LA for just one night to close out 5 deals, get signatures and then fly out by 6am and he offers Max a few hundred dollars to taxi him around for the night and then drop him at the airport. Max agrees and takes him to the first stop, only to discover that Vincent&apos;s job is actually to kill a list of 5 people and, now that Max has witnessed one killing, Vincent has no choice but to keep him with him.\n\nI loved this film; there is no point in trying to hide that fact, but I am not blind to the problems that it has: too many reviewers have either loved it without exception or overly criticised it. The plot has holes  there, I&apos;ve said it. The plot relies on some actions that don&apos;t ring true and other times rely on coincidences or just write things in to move the plot. However this is not a massive problem because it is still very enjoyable and gripping and its other strengths cover these problems. Of course, even with the holes it is still very enjoyable but demands your patience because, although it is tense, it isn&apos;t a roller coaster for the vast majority of the time. It has very fast moments but a lot of it is talky and patient  not a problem for me, but I can see why some multiplexers may have had itchy feet waiting for action. However even with this patience, the film is still very tense  helped by some very sudden moments of violence that come out of nowhere and help put the audience on edge. Much was made in Heat of key moments where opposite characters find common ground and in this film it is the opposite but done to similarly interesting effect. Here Max and Vincent are opposites who get under each others&apos; skins over the course of the night; their relationship is very strange and I think the script does well to bring this across even if it is hard to understand at times (part of this is their relationship getting tied up in some of the plot weaknesses).\n\nA big part of the plot problems being covered is due to the strong direction from Mann, who can shoot a city like nobody else. As others have said, the fly-overs look great but for me the surprise was to see Mann add digital film to his cannon. This allows him to mix very rough, intimate shots with film to bring the audience in closer. I also noticed that he seemed to do very close angles and frames with &apos;proper&apos; film as well, all increasing the feel of being &apos;there&apos; and intimately involved. Of course, on top of this we still had Mann&apos;s usual shooting of LA at night  fluorescent lighting, empty streets and so on  nothing new but it is still very effective and great to look at. If it weren&apos;t for the very heavy cast involved here then Mann would be the main star of the film but, as it is, his direction is just part of the film pulling together to produce the goods.\n\nThe cast is impressive and those who have come on the basis of Cruise alone will be surprised to find so many well known faces who are very able. Cruise wants an Oscar and he has done several of the Oscar tricks to get one  his most recent attempt here is to play totally against type. He does it pretty well, making for a convincing cold killer on the surface but still able to reveal an empty core when he is pushed. If he had been allowed to do this more then maybe he would have been more impressive but he isn&apos;t and the end result is just a good performance. Of course it doesn&apos;t help that Cruise has to play opposite Jamie Foxx delivering one of his most assured performances yet. Based on seeing him in stuff like Booty Call and his own comedy show, I was worried when I saw him due to star in this movie but it turns out that he can act! In fact he dominates the film with a quiet role that runs a gauntlet of emotions while Cruise mostly sits in &apos;cold killer&apos; mode, meaning that, in most scenes, Foxx is the one we are watching. The support cast is surprisingly deep and the amount of familiar faces makes some moments of violence all the more unexpected. While none of them are really given the time to shine, there are quality turns from Smith, Berg, McGill, Hall, Henley and Ruffalo and it gives the (albeit false) impression of an all-star ensemble; although why Jason Stratham bothered to turn out for the one day of shooting he must have done for the airport scene is beyond me. \n\nOverall this is a very effective film. The atmosphere is just right and is helped by the script, the cast and the director  all combining to provide a patient pace that still manages to be very tense and exciting. Mann&apos;s direction is great, mixing film with digital to good effect and Cruise is very good playing against type with a good support cast of well-known faces.\n\nHowever the genuine surprise of the film is Jamie Foxx; better known for clichéd ethnic comedy roles, he steps up here and just about steals every scene he is in."

      "reviewBody": "After using a shotgun hanging in a pawnshop to stop an armed robbery, a homeless man turns celebrated vigilante, much to the annoyance of the corrupt police force in this Canadian action thriller. The film began life as a fake movie trailer and watching the trailer and film back-to-back, it is quite remarkable how much the filmmakers manage to stretch the original premise. The story is hardly airtight with unanswered questions about why the store has loaded weapons on display and how the he keeps accumulating countless bullets really standing out, but it is all a lot of fun with Rutger Hauer perfectly cast in the lead role, several imaginative gory death/maim scenes, plus the filmmakers&apos; acute eye for colour. With lots of neon purple, pink, yellow and other glaring colours throughout, the film possesses a deliciously exaggerated visual look that perfectly complements its over-the-top story. A little too much time is spent on Hauer befriending and conversing with a prostitute who (of course) has a heart of gold, but the prostitute subplot gives the film a welcome &apos;Taxi Driver&apos;-like quality, with Hauer trying to clean the streets much like Travis Bickle. Where the film really rises above the ordinary though is in its acute depiction of a society that neglects and abuses the homeless. Sure, the way they are mistreated is really overdone, but the satirical edge still sticks.",

      "reviewBody": "Alec Guinness is an amazingly under-appreciated actor. While most remembered for his Obi-Wan character, this was one of his least interesting or demanding roles. Few today realize the depth and range of his characterizations as well as the realism that he infused his characters with in his previous films. He was one of the finest British actors and this film is yet another example of his skills.\n\nGuinness plays an angry and blustering Scottish officer who may also be an alcoholic (he at least is a problem drinker and shows many signs of alcoholism). The film begins with this popular officer throwing a farewell party, of sorts, with the men in his command. It seems that Guinness was given temporary command but a replacement (John Mills) is due to arrive shortly--dashing Guinness&apos; hopes for this position becoming permanent.\n\nBecause Guinness&apos; character is so very flawed and petty, he does much to try to undermine the new C.O.. In particular, Mills is a &quot;by the book&quot; sort of officer and Guinness ignores changes Mills orders--and by example, derision and a lack of respect for Mills spreads through the ranks. Instead of behaving like officers and gentlemen, the men behave like this is some sort of popularity contest and they show contempt for their new leader. None of this is helped by Guinness&apos; drinking, as it gets him in trouble and creates serious problems for the regiment.\n\nWhile Mills, as usual, does a great job in the film playing a man who is suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, the film is definitely Guinness&apos;. His boorish character is a great example of him once again immersing himself into a character and the way he responds to the tragedy near the end of the film gives the character great depth and a bit of sympathy--something you needed to make this a stand-out film.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film is extremely well-crafted. The acting is universally excellent, the script tense and well-written and the film is great unless you are the type of person who demands lots of action. While a film about the military, this is no action film. Wonderful.",

      "name": "Jaws parody with enjoyable moments and plenty of gruesome carnage.",
      "reviewBody": "Not many movie-makers do parodies better than Joe Dante  the director who brought us The Howling (a werewolf movie parody), Gremlins (a monster movie parody), Innerspace (a Fantastic Voyage parody), The &apos;Burbs (a neighbours-from-hell parody) and Piranha (a Jaws parody). This 1978 comedy-horror is one of Dante&apos;s early movies, but despite that he shows an assured touch and gets generously tongue-in-cheek performances from his cast of horror veterans. While the film is never a truly great rival to the awesome Jaws, it is a fun and entertaining homage that has much going for it. Easily the strong point of this film is the gruesome make-up provided by whiz-kid Rob Bottin, but more will be said of that later.\n\nA couple of teenagers go missing while trekking through the woods. Private eye Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) goes searching for them, and discovers a burnt-out hermit Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) living on the mountainside who offers to help her in her hunt. McKeown and Grogan stumble upon a secluded military research centre where crazed scientist Dr. Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) is busily conducting experiments to create a strain of piranha fish able to survive in rivers and oceans, and always eager to devour anything in their way. The plan is to release these super-fish in enemy rivers, thereby making the entire river system too dangerous to use. McKeown and Grogan mistakenly release the piranhas into the local river, and realise that anyone using the river for recreation  including the bustling summer camp miles downstream  are now in desperate danger. The army is brought in, but instead of helping to solve the terrifying situation they seem more concerned with covering up the whole business. In particular, General Waxman (Bruce Gordon) has cause to keep the existence of the piranha secret, as he has invested his savings in the summer camp and doesn&apos;t want to scare away his paying customers. In a race against time, Grogan and McKeown try to release poison into the river to prevent the piranhas from devouring everyone in sight and proceeding to the ocean..\n\nPiranha is fast-moving, gory fun. It&apos;s nice to see Dillman in a heroic leading role after so many years of playing the supporting bad guy in numerous films. Menzies is fine as his partner-in-adventure, and there are great supporting roles for horror legends like Barbara Steele (as a military scientist), Dick Miller (as a cowboy entertainer) and Keenan Wynn (as Grogan&apos;s doomed buddy who lives at the riverside). As I said earlier, Rob Bottin provides some bloody make up effects that make some of the half-eaten victims look pretty yucky. The gently mocking script is by John Sayles, and is full of humorous references to earlier books and films along the same theme. The finale in which the holiday-makers fall foul of the piranha fish is packed with blood and guts, and should definitely appeal to gore-hounds. Even though the film keeps its tongue in its cheek, there are still some dumb moments along the way that mar credibility even on this level. For instance, Grogan spends much of the closing scenes underwater being attacked by the piranha. earlier in the film we were made to believe that the piranha devoured their victims in literally a few seconds, but they seem to make ludicrously hard work of attacking Grogan while he&apos;s in the water (in fact, he surfaces after several minutes in the firing line with just a few bites, which seems somewhat fortuitous!!) Piranha is enjoyable, though, and should be well received by genre addicts.",

It&apos;s a &apos;10&apos; all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!",

      "reviewBody": "On the recent occasion of the 50th anniversary of ZDF, I have been intrigued by the title FRANCESCO UND DER PAPST (FRANCESCO AND THE POPE) After the resignation of Benedict XVI and the worldwide enthusiasm arising from the election of his successor, whose name is Francis or Francesco (in Italian), I was quite certain it is the documentary about the newly elected pope (just an interesting coincidence to add: the director, Ciro Cappelari, like pope Francis, is from Argentina). But soon, the date of the production (2011) proved the assumption wrong.\n\nI was surprised to see an 12 year-old narrator of the film, Francesco Janucci, a member of Pueri Cantores at the Sistine Chapel whose presence is a fresh breath within the conventional walls of the Vatican. Although he lives a simple life attending school, playing football with his mates, listening to hip hop music with his two brothers, his world is different, his dreams are also different than those widespread among his pals. Thanks to a unique and highly unpredictable decision of Monsignor Giuseppe Liberto, the day will come for Francesco at a yearly meeting of the choir with the Pope. Francesco will sing solo before Pope Benedict XVI, the hero of his world. Although their realities differ considerably, there is one passion the boy and the pope share: MUSIC.\n\nFRANCESCO AND THE POPE, with its considerably short length and the time span of approximately one year (2009), is a captivating and pretty convincing glimpse of the contrasts in the boy&apos;s world. Expressed implicitly through a hip hop music piece, Fabri Fibra&apos;s &quot;In Italia,&quot; being listened to by his two brothers in contrast with &quot;Dominus Pascit Me&quot; being prepared for the concert, Francesco blends music as fun (which would be the case with the majority of the boys of his age) with music as work (which makes his unique dreams come true). The heart of the documentary concerns him and, though there appear many eminent figures, including Maestro Giuseppe Liberto, Secretary of State, cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, Master of Liturgical Celebrations Guido Marini and Pope Benedict himself, they are all seen from the boy&apos;s perspective, sometimes a naive perspective but a fragile and an absorbing one. Francesco regards the Pope as his friend and hero, he compares his journeys to his grandfather&apos;s, he wonders whether Holy Father feels good and comfortable at the Vatican and takes off his red shoes when being casual. The Pope is constantly present in his daily routines, in his thoughts.\n\nIn background, we get some glimpses of Benedict XVI privately as well as his apostolic journeys of 2009, including Cameroon and Angola in March, the Holy Land (Israel and Jordan) in May and his night return from the Czech Republic in September. Different cameras, different perspectives! We see him privately in his apartments at the Apostolic Palace as well as walking the Vatican Garden and the gardens of Castel Gandolfo with his private secretary Georg Gaenswein. Moreover, the Vatican is presented as not merely a closed world within its walls but a vibrant and open place. Midway through the documentary, we see Pope Benedict XVI being interviewed by different media of the world on the plane. Variety of media, variety of world views that show respect to the Successor of Peter but no one is afraid of opposing world-views and the pope faces controversial questions.\n\nAnd that point draws its perfect parallel to Francesco&apos;s life as well as the intention of Ciro Capellari. The director being an atheist himself, presents the whole story from particularly humane perspective leaving the religious aspect aside. No ultra Catholic views of any devout Catholic who, by the way, would perhaps belong to the sole group that seemingly &apos;worships&apos; the Pope. That diversity is beautifully expressed in the words of She&apos;ar Yashuv Cohen, the Rabbi of Haifa, and makes the Catholic Church and the Vatican more attractive, particularly for young people. Francesco himself states that he would never become a priest and the prayer is not the most helpful means for him but...singing.\n\nAnd singers&apos; dreams come true relatively early while life offers a moment in time that lasts but a short while yet a 5 minute-moment seems like a year. Good to catch such a moment and individually dwell in its bliss till an evening. Even though the end of the day so much differs between two persons... Bellissima Voce, Francesco!\n\nIn this review, I derived some information from www.papst-film.de",

      "reviewBody": "The opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the Archers&apos; logo, the introductory disclaimer, the way the camera pans over the cosmos.  It&apos;s strange to think that `It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&apos; came out in the same year.  No great coincidence: the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered, something best passed over in silence, when placed next to Alfred Junge&apos;s vision.\n\nIt continues to look great all the way through, as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us.  I&apos;m not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general.  One of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other.  Not so here.  Powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it&apos;s the most natural thing in the world, a mere change of palettes.  Both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own.\n\nAs for the story ... this may be Pressburger&apos;s best script, or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events.  Other than that it&apos;s tight, yet with more going on than I can possibly allude to here.  Was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary?  (Or both?  Perhaps Carter dreamt up a fantasy that was, as it so happened, true.)  Everyone says we&apos;re meant to neither ask nor answer this question, but I don&apos;t see why.  I&apos;m sure we ARE meant to ask the question.  The film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed, the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions.  The fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn&apos;t mean that this shouldn&apos;t occupy us as well.  There is, as I&apos;ve said before, a lot going on.\n\nConsider the scene in which Abraham Farlan (Heaven&apos;s prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match, and contemptuously says, `The voice of England, 1945.&apos;  Dr. Reeves (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment, and then produces one of his own: a blues song from America, which Farlan listens to as though he&apos;s got a lemon in his mouth.  Reeves looks smug.\n\nSnobbery?  Well, I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s snobbish to condemn blues music - and that&apos;s not what Powell and Pressburger are doing, anyway.  As the song is being played, we get a shot of the American soldiers listening to it: several of them nod their heads to the rhythm, perfectly at home.  THEY don&apos;t find it incomprehensible.  There&apos;s something valuable about the song and neither Reeves nor Farlan knows what it is.  Reeves probably realises as much.  All English audiences (and all Australian, Indian, etc. audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast, too; and that while Reeves understands THAT, he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence the blues broadcast, which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else.  It&apos;s a clever scene.\n\nOne last thing.  I found David Niven a bit cold, without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so, I don&apos;t think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began, as this one did.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a most enjoyable film classic in the vintage 1940s tradition. The opening segment, as the credits fade out against the backdrop of a cold, dark, night correlate with the sense of mystery and intrigue suggested in the title. There&apos;s something warm and inviting, here for the aficionado.\n\nAlthough shot in 1947, the film has a familiar Dickensian feel to it; there&apos;s the antique store that features as the central setting (shades of &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;), there&apos;s Kenneth Griffith who lurks ominously like Uriah Heep (from &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and Kathleen Harrison, that perennial favourite, is the archetypal Victorian housekeeper. Muriel Pavlow&apos;s character, although not fully explored, has some resemblance to a Dickensian heroine.\n\nThickly moustachioed, Oskar Homolka (cigar-puffing, piercing eyes and busy eyebrows), in the role of protagonist, delivers a masterful performance (can one ever forget him after watching him in whichever role he plays?). He and Griffith are the driving forces that propel this absorbing drama. For one relatively new to acting, Griffith delivers a convincing performance. Beneath the superficial layer of criminal activity, the film goes deeper to touch on, among other issues, the nature of evil which in Griffith&apos;s case appears to be an inherent trait. In the case of Homolka: is he a tragic figure, does he evoke a sense of pathos, does he earn our sympathy? These are some of the questions which the view faces at the film unfolds.\n\nThe 1940s was the highpoint in British cinema and it&apos;s not difficult to see why this film is so highly rated in the canon.\n\nPS: If you are a lover of classical music, you will enjoy a bonus!",

      "reviewBody": "I must have watched a French comedy and put the titles of all the films previewed on my Netflix list, because they keep coming. Bienvenue! This 2010 film from France is the latest—a pleasant farce directed by Michel Leclerc and written by him and Baya Kasmi. It won three César Awards in 2011, including for best writing. The story is about a young woman who uses sex as a weapon to persuade conservative politicians—men whom she considers &quot;right-wing&quot; in general—to embrace more liberal attitudes. From this comes some satirical moments, too, touching on the impermanence of supposed firmly held beliefs and the pitfalls of stereotyping ethnic and religious groups based simply on how they look or what their names are. Half-Algerian, the young woman&apos;s name is Baya Benmahmoud,and she says, &quot;no one in France has that name.&quot; But she tackles one person too many when she confronts Arthur Martin—&quot;15,207 people in France have the same name,&quot; he tells us—a middle-aged scientist who does necropsies on dead birds, in order to detect possible human illnesses. Why are you scaring people? she demands to know at their first confrontational meeting. The free spirit and the buttoned-up scientist are, of course, destined to fall for each other. The filmmakers show us how the two protagonists do not escape their childhoods, and we see them as children, as children commenting on their adult selves, and the fireworks when their polar opposite families, alas, meet. In his New York Times review, Stephen Holden says the movie &quot;has the tone and structure of early-to-middle Woody Allen,but infused with a dose of Gallic identity politics.&quot; Sara Forestier is charming as the irrepressible extrovert Baya (she also snagged a César), and Jacques Gamblin is a persuasive match. A fun movie when you just want to be happily entertained (note: nudity)",

      "reviewBody": "A quick look on Wikipedia tells the real story of the Police Athletic League and how it was founded. For one thing it was founded over 20 years earlier before this film Juvenile Court came out.\n\nJuvenile Court is yet another of the films that Harry Cohn was using to build up Rita Hayworth. In this film Rita is the sister of notorious public enemy John Tyrell and they have a younger brother Frankie Darro who looks like he&apos;s going to go the same route as big brother. In fact the film opens with the cops capturing Tyrell in a shootout.\n\nTyrell is found guilty even after an eloquent plea by his public defender lawyer Paul Kelly. Both Darro and Hayworth vent on Kelly, but after a while Hayworth warms up to him a bit especially after his idea of the Police Athletic League with the police sponsoring youth activities for the slum kids.\n\nDarro is one tough nut to crack however and he and a few friends nearly wreck the PAL before it gets off the ground.\n\nThe plot if anyone noticed is taken straight from Boys Town. It also has a generous helping of Dead End kid attitude from Darro and his friends. Still it certainly didn&apos;t hurt Rita Hayworth&apos;s career to be associated with Juvenile Court. At the end there is a quasi judicial juvenile court of sorts.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Extreme Justice&apos; is one of those action films that teethers on a great premise. Not original, but good ground for entertainment &amp; some thought as well. Scott Glenn, Lou Diamond Phillips and a supporting cast of known faces directed by Mark L. Lester (Commando) carry out this dark trip, but the end product is merely average in most regards.\n\nDet. Powers (Phillips) take it too far with a kidnapping suspect and it looks like IA is going to bounce him off the force after multiple brushes with him. That is until his former partner Det. Vaughn (Glenn) calls in some favors to get him reassigned to SIS (real life LAPD unit). Tired of seeing criminals go free or get joke sentences, this squad makes it their sole purpose to put repeat criminals away for good - in body bags.\n\nThis simple idea works on the surface because everyone knows in real life the justice system ain&apos;t perfect and Phillips character acts as our moral guide traversing this dangerous terrain. Everyone wants justice served, but where does the line get drawn? That sort of shtick however it isn&apos;t content with keeping things believable. This unit, these cops allow suspects to commit their crimes in front of them under surveillance and only move in to waste &apos;em after their deeds are in progress or done which puts innocent victims at risk.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of faces here which I&apos;m a sucker for. You got b-movie regular Ed Lauter as the Captain of the unit. He&apos;s still doing hand jesters like he did in &apos;Raw Deal&apos;. While Yaphet Kotto, William Lucking and Andrew Divoff make up fellow cops. Stephen Root a news agency boss while William McNamara plays one of the criminals. I&apos;d be remiss if I didn&apos;t mention this is the second film I&apos;ve seen Chelsea Field play a integral reporter linked to a main hero too.\n\nThings get contrived in &apos;Extreme Justice&apos; and then just flat out dumb which ultimately what keeps it from being better. You can see where things are going a mile ahead and Glenn who starts off as a jaded, but believable presence is no more than a sociopath caricature with a badge by the end. The bum finale, ridiculous end title card. The action is entertaining, but it only gets you so far.",

Its odd but for some reason a book all about the universe and someone who knows all about the universe is written only by onlookers and bystanders. The people who made the movie are not saying that it did or didn&apos;t happen but it is possible that these onlookers might have made a mistake on how Jesus and God want us to be. All this movie does is try to make you think deeper about religion, and I love it for that. If your like me you would really like &quot;Dogma&quot; too ;)"

      "reviewBody": "When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.\n\nFilm history&apos;s most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can&apos;t seem to help stealing every scene he&apos;s in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.\n\nThis movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to achieve as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).\n\nThis film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don&apos;t know anyone who hasn&apos;t seen it, but if you haven&apos;t, don&apos;t walk to see it. Run.",

      "reviewBody": "This outer space-opera buddy movie deals about earthlings and aliens facing a fierce fight . Two futuristic contenders a Draconian(Louis Gossett Jr) and a human(Dennis Quaid) dogfighting over the skies in their aircrafts .When the mortal space enemies are gunned down, they are stranded together into a faraway barren planet. They&apos;re forced to become friends and rely on one another in order to survive. The enemies, earthman and reptilian alien survive on hostile world facing enslavers foes(usual nasty Brion James).\n\nThis warmhearted Sci-Fi story packs noisy action, intrigue, space battles and good feeling . The cuddly story relies heavily on the continued relationship the two protagonists, however is quite amusing. Sensational and perceptible acting by Louis Gossett in spite of the mask and makeup by Chris Wallas(The fly), furthermore he must speak with purring. Spectacular production design by Rolf Zehelbauer(Cabaret, Odessa file, and he&apos;s Fassbinder&apos;s usual). Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Tony Imi. Wonderful music score by Maurice Jarre, though uses synthesizer, he&apos;s a classic musician and habitual of David Lean(Laurence of Arabia,Dr. Zhivago,Ryan&apos;s daughter). The motion picture is directed with sensibility by Wolfgang Petersen , a German working in Hollywood who achieved many hits, before(Das boot,Neverending story), like after( Troy, Perfect storm,Airforce one,Outbreak). Rating: Good, above average.",

      "reviewBody": "A pristine restoration of David Lean&apos;s fantasy comedy based on Noël Coward&apos;s successful play, BLITHE SPIRIT is Lean&apos;s third feature film and pairs Rex Harrison and Constance Cummings as a middle-class couple Charles and Ruth, both have been married before, out of his whim, Charles invites a kooky medium Madame Arcati (Rutherford) to their rural house to arrange a séance, which he naively thinks is good for inspiration since he is a novelist and Ruth, takes the whole arrangement ever so light-heartedly, only participates out of sheer curiosity, but after the supernormal session, it turns out Madame Arcati is not a fraud at all, Elvira (Hammond), Charles&apos; deceased first wife, has been invoked from the other side and materialises, but only to Charles, who is pleasantly surprised and they start to banter with each other, which vastly irritates Ruth.\n\nSeeking help from Madame Arcati of no avail, Ruth realises she must fight Elvira for Charles, and a subsequent outlandish accident, secretly plotted by Elvira, puts her in the same circumstance as Elvira, while Madame Arcati&apos;s final attempt to exorcise the dead from the living world fails, her crystal ball indicates a cue that there is another human being under the same roof is actually capable of accomplish that task.\n\nThe story does sound idiotic and Coward&apos;s original play has no ambition to be a wacky science fiction other than a farcical fairytale (the film begins convivially with the &quot;once upon a time&quot; introduction), a frivolous (but also cartoon-ishly lethal) tug-of-war between two women divided by two worlds, with poles apart temperaments (Elvira is mischievously petulant while Ruth is uncompromisingly virtuous), thus, the acting is fairly engrossing, the four main characters all cop an attitude with their respectively distinct personalities, the repartees among Harrison, Cummings and Hammond are as rapid as any theatrical live performance, whereas Dame Margaret Rutherford&apos;s eccentric actualisation of Madame Arcati is an uplifting phenomenon, such a force of nature and she defies any ridicule of her calling.\n\nHowever, more essentially, it is Lean&apos;s cutting-edge job in fabricating a human-ghost co-existent magic presence becomes a major reason why this little piece of gem sustains its life-force, under the stunning Technicolor palette, this restored version is truly a boon for a first-time viewer, if you are into some carefree diversion of spectres, death and necromancy.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; is an incredibly well made film--with great acting and some lovely production values. Clearly, MGM gave this film the full glossy studio treatment. And, for her wonderful performance, Greer Garson was nominated for an Oscar. However, I am very ambivalent about the film because so many of the characters are either despicable or pathetic. In many ways, it reminds me of the country music song &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;--as a woman should put up with ANYTHING in order to keep even the most awful man. Clearly, this is a film for dependent personalities! \n\nThe film begins near the present time. The Parkington family appears to be made up of a group of sociopaths--all loathsome jerks who think mostly of themselves. When the matriarch, Mrs. Parkington (Garson) learns that one of the brood is a thief, she begins to reminisce--remembering her life with Mr. Parkington (Walter Pidgeon). At first, their marriage seems pretty nice--with a rich and doting husband. However, through the course of these long series of flashbacks, you learn that Mr. Parkington is vindictive, petty, selfish and cheats on Mrs. Parkington. And, as for Mrs. Parkington, she is clever and long-suffering--and lifted up as some sort of shining example. I couldn&apos;t help but think she was pathetic and would have probably accepted Mr. Parkington back after he murdered or slept with children or sheep. And this brings me to my ambivalence--no one--not anyone in this family is likable in the least. And, the film seems to promote the notion that a woman&apos;s job is just to put up with this and smile throughout! Talk about an anti-feminist message! The bottom line is that I&apos;d hate for my daughters to watch such a film, as I&apos;d hate to think that Mrs. Parkington is someone to admire (though the film tries HARD to say this). If Garson&apos;s character had either shot her husband or left him and bled him dry in alimony, then maybe I would have enjoyed it much more. A great job of acting and a sick message to this film.\n\nOh, and I should mention that in one brief scene, the Parkingtons joke about how it is Mr. Parkington&apos;s job to regularly &apos;thrash his wife&apos;. Wow....need I say any more?! Well, yes. If you like films that promote women as lovely doormats, also try Mary Pickford&apos;s last film, &quot;Secrets&quot;. Her husband is also a piece of work and she looks back fondly to their lives together.",

      "reviewBody": "In Tickle Me (easily one of the great titles of Elvis&apos; illustrious screen career), the King plays -- brace yourself -- a singing rodeo cowboy with a lucrative second job as a handyman at a beauty spa.  Naturally, all of the women at the ranch compete for E&apos;s attentions, but he&apos;s only got eyes for the stunning Jocelyn Lane.  The second half of the film gets supremely silly, as the lovers search for a hidden treasure of gold in a haunted house.  The horrifyingly awful gags that accompany the climactic sequence belong in a Scooby Doo episode, but are more accurately akin to the Three Stooges -- since writers Elwood Ullman and Edward Bernds had put in time for the eye-gouging, hair-pulling, face-slapping nitwits.  Tickle Me has a weird appeal to me, however, as it allows Elvis the opportunity to show off his talent for comedy (an under-appreciated aspect of his acting for which he shows remarkable aptitude)."

      "name": "Cheesy 80s fun!",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Nine To Five&quot; is one of those classic 80s comedies which was what made the decade so fun as far as movies go. Jane Fonda plays Judy, a recently divorced housewife who lands a secretarial job at a corporate office. Lily Tomlin is Violet, the beleagured supervisor at the office who shows Judy the ropes on her disasterous first day. Dolly Parton is Doralee, a secretary whom everyone at the office thinks is using her - ahem - &quot;assets&quot; to get ahead by sleeping with the boss.\n\nSoon these three become best friends and team up after they&apos;ve gotten fed up with their chauvinistic and smarmy boss Mr. Hart, played to the hilt by Dabney Coleman. Sure, it does delve into zany corniness, such as the scene where they all get high on pot and share their fantasies about how each of them would like to knock off the boss (the funniest is Violet&apos;s &quot;Snow White&quot; coffee one, which uses cartoon animation and live action) or the scene where Violet thinks she accidentally poisoned Mr. Hart&apos;s coffee with rat poison and tries to steal his supposed dead corpse out of the hospital! This is the kind of movie where you check your brain at the door and take it for what it is.\n\nThere are some great one-liners like the one where Fonda tells her ex-husband, who thinks she&apos;s having a kinky S&amp;M affair with Mr. Hart, something along the lines of, &quot;If I want to do M&amp;M&apos;s, that&apos;s fine with me!&quot; The office they work in is reminiscent of the one in &quot;The Apartment&quot;. Three very clever characters, great comedic acting from Parton as Doralee and Tomlin as Violet. Jane Fonda, who I never cared much for, was good as the naive Judy. Sterling Hayden has a great cameo at the end as the &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot;. A funny revenge comedy about Every Office, U.S.A.. You gotta love the theme song, too. Most recommended!",

Here the songs come from the off most of the time (until the camera surprisingly moves to the classic singer on a stage) and do something that usually reduces the quality of a movie: they tell you what&apos;s going on in the pictures. But those pictures are of such an elegic beauty (with the typical yellow &quot;Im-tone&quot;) that you feel a story is told to you by your grandfather and it unfolds perfectly in front of your eyes. I saw the screening during the MIFED 2000 together with only one (!) other guest and am quite astonished that film fans and buyers might overlook this masterpiece about an exclusive one-on-one love that touches our hearts.",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot; I&apos;ve had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was &quot;How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?&quot; rather than &quot;How entertaining is this film overall?&quot; I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I&apos;ll never know how I&apos;d have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I&apos;d have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children&apos;s movies, like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; are so successful partly because they&apos;re so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children&apos;s movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they&apos;re based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children&apos;s book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That&apos;s why it&apos;s easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don&apos;t have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It&apos;s as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don&apos;t. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that&apos;s exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry&apos;s two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children&apos;s delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry&apos;s swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire.&quot; Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors&apos; faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry&apos;s caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren&apos;t in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--&quot;Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers&quot;--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn&apos;t as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I&apos;m blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling&apos;s series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary &quot;muggle&quot; world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you&apos;re left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I&apos;ve never seen happen before, though I don&apos;t go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn&apos;t have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn&apos;t really trying to get involved in the movie&apos;s story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry&apos;s anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he&apos;s kicked out, he&apos;ll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn&apos;t tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry&apos;s adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn&apos;t enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children&apos;s series, but it doesn&apos;t entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book&apos;s delights to the screen. In its current form, it&apos;s almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling&apos;s series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",

This dose a good job of covering the government attacks on Black Radicals and looks at what actually became of these people and the organization. The interviews and reflections of former members still in prison, some who will soon die there, really closes the story on a powerful note.\n\nI once watched this with a former civil rights activist and current Caribbean community organizer and he was left speechless.",

      "name": "certainly not a sunny story, but it&apos;s as darkly exhilarating and ominous as any Shakespeare adaptation can get",
      "reviewBody": "To get the obvious out of the way- Roman Polanski directed Macbeth as the first film following the death of his wife, Sharon Tate, and unborn child at the hands of Charles Manson&apos;s gang. That factor in the film- not least of which in small details, like the first shot after the opening credits where a man finishing slaying someone looks just like Manson, beard and all- is undeniable, but it shouldn&apos;t be counted as the sole influence. Aside from the purging, as far as I can figure, Polanski was doing for himself by going all out in showing the frank and bloody depictions of violence and almost cleansing (as Lady Macbeth would do in madness) of blood on hands that could never come off, of the sort of psychological impact of violence and its aftermath, it was a bloody time in the world and in films. As Vietnam continued to go on, the best films of 1971- and Macbeth could be counted as one of them- were some of the most stylish and explicit in how they attacked systems of government, corruption, and bad-ass anti-heroes or outright villains (A Clockwork Orange and Dirty Harry come immediately to mind). It would practically be dishonest, in a sense, for Polanski not to show how grotesque the acts of murder that, for example, Macbeth&apos;s men do on MacDuff&apos;s family and servants, or the simple, sadistic carnage of Macbeth&apos;s final curtain call in the climax, considering the mood and controversies of the period.\n\nCompared to some of the really radical films of the year, however, Macbeth&apos;s story is as old and cherished as children&apos;s fables. Yes, children, you all remember the story of ambitious young Macbeth, prodded on by the alleged prophecies of three weird witches, who murders the king by his own (and his wife&apos;s) accord, and soon goes mad as power grips him into overreaching his domain and believing himself to be invincible to all but a fleet of woods. Not really too much happiness in Shakespeare&apos;s work, and all the better, as it might be his masterpiece: a saga of the frailties of the human conscience and abstractions of consciousness, where the supernatural substitutes just as well for faith in some religious calling- and a questioning and doubt throughout- and what it does to those around the Mr &amp; Mrs who still can&apos;t cope deep down with killing a man in the dead of night. Yet even more incredible is that Polanski, as well as Kurosawa with Throne of Blood, enrich the material with the film adaptations, changing around some scenes, omitting some altogether, and offering brands of surrealism based on preferred styles.\n\nWhile Kurosawa stuck to the Noh method for much of his film, Polanski&apos;s Macbeth is an atmospheric milestone as far as concrete production design can go (never once does it feel like they used a fake castle, or much of a fake set even), and all the grays and dark Earth colors, especially when Macbeth goes to the witches a second time, blend into something that matches the psychological conundrum of the king of Scotland and his desperate wife. But seeing Polanski take things further, with touches of the bizarre (the floating and illusionary dagger, the drops of blood in Lady&apos;s hands, and the spectacular scene of Macbeth seeing through the windows, shot in a hazy and pirouetting camera), and showing what was only alluded to in strange and exciting ways- the killing scene in the bedroom feels almost like the Psycho shower scene, missed stabs and the messy quality of it all, only from the guilty party&apos;s point of view. This, plus the attention to detail in storytelling, the nuanced and gleefully over-the-top dialog provided very close to the original text, and even hand-held camera-work right out of something in Repulsion, makes this a work of daring for Polanski, not simply in the realm of elaborate fights (though there is that) or blood-shed (a lot of that) or decapitations (one or two gushing ones).\n\nThough not to forget as part of the success too, aside from the director&apos;s total control of mis-en-scene, are the actors. Jon Finch, who also appeared in Frenzy, is a tightly wound loose cannon, if that makes sense, whose voice-over narration sometimes blends in with talking to himself, and the look in his eyes sometimes tells all, or perhaps not, as case might be. Although Welles and Mifune have their fair share of great Macbeth points in other films, Finch proves himself as on their same level, if only for this one moment in his career. Also very noteworthy (albeit such a meaty part for any actress) is Francessa Annis as Lady Macbeth, and Terence Baylor as MacDuff, and Stephan Chase as Malcolm is a very good choice. And as usual Polanski populates his picture with effective faces, strange looks that seem very conventional and at the same time all apart of the visual and mood. I loved seeing the whole room of witches, most naked (thanks to Hugh Hefner mayhap), and it almost seeming as if a bare minimum of make-up was used.\n\nBottom line, if you&apos;re looking for a hallmark of the dark literary drama, or a disturbing tale of the madness of power, or just a classic Polanski film, it&apos;s all here.",

      "reviewBody": "The small coastal town of Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th year since being founded. However the residents are not aware of the tragic history of their small town and think nothing of the wider significance of the date as they prepare for a big party; they don&apos;t even put together all the strange things that start happening on the day itself. However when a small boat is lost in a dense fog that contains a mysterious ship some residents begin to suspect something more sinister than meteorology is at work.\n\nWith a remake in the cinemas and the fact that I had just returned from the coast of northern California I thought I&apos;d revisit The Fog having not seen it for almost 15 years. Trading on the very hallmarks that made John Carpenter famous (before he couldn&apos;t buy a hit movie) The Fog is an effective chiller even if it won&apos;t scare those accustomed to more gory, modern fare. Quite short and to the point, the film makes good use of the fog to draw tension out of every scene and overcomes the potential silliness of a smoke machine working overtime behind the scenes. Instead the tension is consistent and produces a good few jumps and build ups along the way; the ghosts are kept well hidden so that the limited effects don&apos;t undermine them by totally exposing them. Carpenter uses his usual minimalist electronic score to good effect, playing it low and constant like a heartbeat.\n\nThe famous cast help the convincing atmosphere and do more than just run and scream. Barbeau leads the cast well from the solitude of her lighthouse and she helps keep the tension up with her delivery. Curtis and Leigh both have smaller roles but they add class to the film and they &quot;do&quot; scared well. Atkins makes for a good male lead and he gets solid help from Holbrook and a few others in supporting roles. The zombie creatures move slowly but are a good presence.\n\nOverall this is a solid chiller from the days when Carpenter seemed to know what he was doing. The low budget effects are covered up by solid delivery and a consistently tense atmosphere which is supported by convincing performances and Carpenter&apos;s usual low, steady consistent score."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Niagara Motel&quot; is a hard film to categorize. Its tone fluctuates wildly. Most of the characters have serious problems that for the most part are played straight and seriously but there are some scenes that suddenly turn to flaming black comedy. If you need characters to care about in a movie, they are a bit in short supply here, but there are exceptions. Caroline Dhavernas, in the role of an apparently squeaky clean waitress who is, surprisingly, considering joining the &quot;adult entertainment&quot; industry, is a joy to watch whenever she is on screen. British Actress Anna Friel brings some much needed feistiness to her role as a recovering young drug addict trying to get her child back from a bureaucratic Children&apos;s Aide social worker. And Wendy Crewson brings flashes of warmth when her character discovers the hooker next door is both more interesting and nicer than she had imagined.\n\nI saw the movie on DVD. Be sure to watch the audio-commentary version and the other various features of the actors and director talking about the various characters after you&apos;ve watched the main feature (only 88 minutes long). Clearly all the actors really loved their characters. I felt much better about the movie after I learned how the actual scenes developed in process.\n\nAmusingly, the city of Niagara Falls (Canada) thought that the movie focused so much on the seediest aspects of the city that they refused to cooperate in its filming. So, the few outdoor scenes that were actually shot in Niagara Falls were shot surreptitiously from the back of a van.\n\nWorth watching on DVD with all the extra features. &quot;",

No doubt about it, the cinematography of Siu-keung Cheng &amp; editing by David Richardson are first class, but it is also the source of my greatest frustration with this film. For mine the camera moves around too often, too quickly &amp; will come to a holt in a sudden jolt. The opening scene in particular is just nauseating despite the obvious skill in putting it all together.\n\nWell worth checking out &amp; I&apos;m sure that we will see a Hollywood rip-off of this film some time in the next couple of years.",

The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable, unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it. The worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow!",

      "name": "Italian middling epic movie about the usual hero , the corpulent Hercules/Alan Steel , combating enemies and a nasty usurper",
      "reviewBody": "His is an average peplum dealing with Hercules attempting to keep peace and justice by combating an usurper Philip the Arab with a beautiful princess called Ulpia in the mix . This mythological movie is plenty of adventures , emotions , thrills , atmospheric settings and colorful scenarios well photographed . Don&apos;t expecting too much accuracy at the adventure/fantasy flick , as we get to watch a light and simple low-middle-budgeted Peplum or ¨swords and sandals¨ movie with the corpulent Alan Steel, or Sergio Ciani , accompanied by a multitude of Italian B-big name support cast such as : Mimmo Palmara , Livio Lorenzon , Daniele Vargas , Carlo Tamberlani , Wandisa Guida , Nello Pazzafini , Sal Borgese , among others . As the mighty Hercules (Alan Steel) to free the Roman Empire from an oppressive , evil ruler and surely all who stand in his way . As Hercules to keep wits and strength about him when he is deceived by astute traitors and imprisoned into dark undergrounds dungeons . In this rarely seen muscle epic , set in the reign of the gordians in which Hercules helped by Lucio Traiano (Mimmo Palmara) and friends , all of them take part in a battle royal against a heinous usurping king , as the latter killed an elderly Gordian to take the throne . This time the hero known as Hercules (renamed Samson for Americans) runs head-on into the forces of a cruel tyrant (Daniele Vargas ) who has thrown-out a King (Carlo Tamberlani) and ruled over the capital , a city called Ravena , along the way falling in love for a princess Ulpia (Wandisa Guisa) , to retrieve her throne . All the usual comes into play as the bad guys are eventually subdued . As Hercules survives long enough to battle a villainous in a final fighting .\n\nThis moving Peplum contains emotion , noisy action sequences incorporating breathtaking fights , spectacular battles with lots of sword-wielding warriors , court intrigue and many other things . There&apos;s a bit more intentional humor with tongue-firmly-in-cheek than usual in this Peplum opus . This is an ordinary spaghetti , myth-opera with noisy action , love , battles and luxurious landscapes . There was used sets left over from other films taking parts here and there of other Peplums , especially on the battle scenes in the end .The movie has not mythological accuracy neither expecting historical , as these events took place in Parthia border not in Ravenna , that&apos;s why the actual Philip the Arab murdered in reality Gordian III who was just a mere boy 14 years old back in 244 ad. It stars Sergio Ciani , a hunk man who made lots of roman epic films , also called ¨Musclemen movies¨. Sergio&apos;s luck changed when an Italian producer persuaded him to play Peplums similarly to Steve Reeves , who really paved the way for others actors to seek their fame and fortune in Italy playing bouncing adventurers . Other stars by the time on this type of movies are the followings : Mark Forest , Gordon Mitchell , Dan Vadis , Reg Park , Brad Harris , Samson Burke , Richard Harrison , Rock Stevens and Kirk Morris . Nobody, nevertheless , topped Steve Reeves in popularity , though Gordon Scott made him a important competence . Alan Steel started off his beefcake run off as a body double for Reeves in both the &quot;Hercules&quot; sequel ¨Hercules Unchained¨ (1959) and in ¨Giant of Marathon¨ (1959) , in which he also had bit roles . Within a couple of years Steel was posing front-and-center as Herk himself and entering in the star-system based on pumped-up heroes playing ¨Sansone or Samson¨ (1961) , opposite another physique-minded American import , Brad Harris in the title role . On numerous occasions Steel was asked to play the legendary Greek hero , as well as the equally well-built demigods Samson and Ursus, even though the film titles often fused (or confused) them in their titles . Steel starred as ¨Hercules in Ercole Contro Roma or Hercules Against Rome¨ (1964) , ¨Hercules Against the Moon Men¨ (1964) , ¨Sansone Contro Il Corsaro Nero or Hercules and the Black Pirate¨ (1964) , and ¨Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas¨ (1964) , the second movie mentioned being one of the only spectacles to actually incorporate science fiction into the genre. In contrast , his Hercules serves as a mere sidekick in the Zorro-like spectacle ¨Golia e Il Cavaliere Mascherato or Hercules and the Masked Rider¨ (1963) starring Ettore Manni . In addition , he performed Ursus , ¨Il Gladiatore Ribelle or Ursus , the Rebel Gladiator¨ (1962) opposite Dan Vadis . He also played the supporting role of Kaldos in ¨Rocha , son of Samson or The Fury of Hércules¨ (1962) when it was Brad Harris&apos; turn to play the title role , and ¨Samson and his mighty challenge¨ (1964) . By mid-decade the Herculean phase had faded away and Steel went on, unlike others peplum stars, to other film styles such as dramas , thrillers , horror, oaters , even comedies and he eventually moved into Spaghetti Western and spies . In the late 1960s he and fellow movie musclemen Kirk Morris and Gordon Mitchell served up &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot; entitled ¨Sapevano Solo Uccidere¨ (1968) and ¨Fast hand¨ (1973). The film benefits itself from an acceptable secondary cast , full of familiar faces such as Carlo Tamberlani , Nello Pazzafini , Sal Borgese , Attilio Dotessio , Balsamo , Guarneri , and three gorgeous Eurotrash actresses as Wandisa Guisa and Dina De Santis. In spite of mediocre interpretations , the acting honors go to Daniele Vargas as Filippo Afro , the nasty usurper and Livio Lorenzo as his hoodlum Mansurio .\n\nColorful cinematography in Eastmancolor , TotalScope 16 mm by Augusto Tiezzi , shot on location in Lacio , Rome and Elios Studios . Atmospheric and evocative Original music by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino who composed lots of Peplums and Spaghettis . The film was regular but professionally directed by Piero Pierotti . Piero continued to realize films in the historical-spectacular style , at which he developed an acceptable skill and mastery . He was a professional filmmaker , a craftsman who directed all kind of genres , and especially adventure and Peplum movie . Pierotti wrote/directed : ¨Zorro¨, ¨Hércules against Rome¨ , &quot;Giant of the Evil Island&quot; , ¨Rome against Rome¨, ¨Sansone Contro Il Corsaro Nero¨, ¨Erik the conqueror¨, ¨Pedro El Cruel¨, ¨Golia e Il Cavaliere Mascherato¨ , ¨Marco Polo¨ and many others . Rating 4,5/10 , passable though mediocre .",

      "reviewBody": "For some reason, over the years I failed to see this particular John Ford western, thinking it was probably just another cavalry yarn and I&apos;d seen so many of them I figured I&apos;d let this one pass.\n\nWrong. It&apos;s now among my favorite John Ford westerns with both JOHN WAYNE and MAUREEN O&apos;HARA giving really heartfelt performances as a husband and wife separated for some time, their only son (CLAUDE JARMAN, JR.) having just joined the regiment as a soldier under his father&apos;s command at an outpost being menaced by Apaches.\n\nThere&apos;s a jaunty, rollicking score by Victor Young that captures ballads of the Old West to provide some colorful background music, wonderful scenes of soldiers training under VICTOR McLAGLEN (at his crustiest and endearingly funny), BEN JOHNSON (wonderful as a man on the lam), and the breezily confident HARRY CAREY, JR. It&apos;s even got a story that has more than one theme running through it--the personal conflict between father and son, husband and wife, and how the young son (played extremely well by Claude Jarman, Jr.) has to prove himself to his fellow soldiers.\n\nThe final shootout occurs when the Apaches kidnap some children and hold them prisoners in a church. It sets the stage for the final encounter, just one of several skirmishes with the Indians that is masterfully staged and photographed.\n\nPictorially, it&apos;s one of the handsomest of all the John Ford epics and should definitely have been filmed in Technicolor, although the B&amp;W photography is indeed impressive. MAUREEN O&apos;HARA gives one of her most sensitive portrayals and JOHN WAYNE is at his best.\n\nSumming up: A solid western well worth watching whether you&apos;re a John Ford fan or not.",
