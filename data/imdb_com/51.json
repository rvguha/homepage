      "reviewBody": "We watched this film with trepidation. The Farrelly brothers don&apos;t actually believe in subtlety. &quot;The Ringer&quot; has a cast of mentally challenged players; frankly one feared the worst. Well, as it turned out, this is not your typical movie by the masters of grossness. The direction was entrusted to Barry Blaustein and the writing to Ricky Blitt. While there is some grossness, as was perhaps expected, the makers are actually quite respectful of the people involved in the Special Olympics.\n\nDon&apos;t get confused, this is a formula movie, or at least this is what the finished product feels like. The idea of Johnny Knoxville passing as one of the handicapped youths, sounded preposterous. Yet, Mr. Knoxville&apos;s performance is one of the reasons for watching it. The great Brian Cox is a hilarious presence as the uncle from hell. Lovely Katherine Heigl adds charm to the proceedings.\n\nThis is a fun film because it celebrates people that are less fortunate than the rest of us. They are all portrayed in a dignified manner.",

But upon departing, the father is arrested and must let the family go. Years later when he is released, he climbs on board and heads to the U.S. hoping to find his family. On the way there he meets a sexy woman that slowly changes his life. Upon arrival in the states, Miami seems to be a much bigger place than he imagined and hopes of finding his family seems a lot harder than expected. It&apos;s romantic, sensual, and funny &amp; if you believe in fairy tales, this movie is made for you. Go ask your local video store if they carry it and if its in there, get it! You&apos;re going to love it, trust me!"

      "name": "Twilight Western in which Newman sparkles as a judge who dispenses frontier justice in the days of wild west",
      "reviewBody": "This is an outdoor epic Western in which director John Huston offers us an exciting , dramatic and amusing film . The Life and Times of Roy Bean (1972) is an intense , weird and rewarding western , which is filmed on location in Arizona with Paul Newman as the fabled hanging judge . It focuses on judge Roy Bean and his peculiar working methods , struggles and different visions of the country and world . Judge Roy Bean known as ¨The law west of the Pecos ¨ sentences outlaws by hanging them . And with varied group of misfit characters , the film explores the misery and the greatness of the human condition . Paul Newman was 47 years old when he played this movie and he was a very prestigious actor . The film gave Newman one of the best roles , playing a strong but sympathetic character , giving an attractive role as a cruel judge who&apos;ll stop at nothing to get his purports . As Newman/Bean is nice , likeable and capable , but at the same time , being a brutal person , that&apos;s why he relentlessly judges , condemns and sentences by hanging whatever suspect . The film describes the institutional and administrative instability that prevails in wide zones of western border , underscores the friendship , companionship , honesty , sense of adventure, enterprise and expeditive justice by sentencing against unscrupulous and dishonest people . The narrative is vivid and vibrant . The story is well presented , polished , stylish and free of nonessential items . The dialogues are sharp and funny , peppered with humor . The film includes spectacular scenes , fast-paced and iconographic amalgam of the vintage westerns with romantic references characteristic of modern western .\n\nIt&apos;s also a comedy , with a top-notch Newman and his special relationship with a familiar plethora of notorious secondaries , such as : Stacy Keach who&apos;s oustanding as Bad Boy , Anthony Perkins as a rare priest , Jacqueline Bisset as Bean&apos;s daughter , John Huston himself , Jack Colvin , Roddy McDowall , Anthony Zerbe, Ned Beatty , Matt Clark , Richard Farnsworth , Tab Hunter , Bill McKinney , Steve Kanaly, and of course , Ava Gardner as the famous Lilie Langtry . Furthermore, movie debut of the extremely gorgeous and very young Victoria Principal . It contains brilliant and amazing cinematography by Richard Moore that places an emphasis on the realism of the action and splendid frames , which is one of the best things of the movie . Emotive and stirring musical score by Maurice Jarre . The film was well made by John Huston , being a solid, absorbing and entertaining oater , while providing some interesting set-pieces among the strangeness . Huston exceeded making all kinds of genres , realizing here an excellent flick with a great feeling of coherence and emphasis as the majority of which went over his career.\n\nThe Bean &apos;s role is based on actual events as Roy Bean (1825-1903) was a near-illiterate frontier justice of the peace who ran a combined court-saloon in the tiny railroad hamlet of Langtry in the West Texas desert between the River Pecos and the Rio Grande . He was known as the ¨Lay west of the Pecos¨ . He was running a saloon in a tent-town for railroad builders called Vinegaroon . Ben , backed by the Texas Rangers and the railroad , was appointed Justice of the peace , although he had never studied law . He managed to keep the peace with a strange brand of common and rough sense , often basing his ruling on a single law book . The stories about him are legion, most apocryphal . The fines usually stayed in his pocket and he acquitted accused on condition that he buy a round of drinks for the boys . The law of the Pecos was a law unto himself . He got himself elected Langtry&apos;s justice of the peace , holding court in his crude saloon called the ¨Jersey Lily¨ where he lived till his death in 1903 . In 1896 he brought fame to Langtry by staging the Fitzsmmons-Peter Maher heavyweight-boxing championship. He also performed marriages , ending the short ceremony with the worlds ¨I Roy Bean , justice of the peace , hereby pronounce man and wife . May God have mercy on your souls¨. Bean&apos;s ¨Jersey Lily¨ has been preserved by the Texas Highway Department and is now a tourist attraction.",

      "name": "Three of Hong Kong&apos;s iconic directors",
      "reviewBody": "A notable collaboration between three of the most iconic directors in Hong Kong, Triangle is a complex crime film from which one should expect the unexpected.\n\nThis is a not a Pulp Fiction (1994) or Three Extremes (2004) style anthology, but instead a single, linear story in which the baton is passed from one director to the next, a bit like The Signal (2007). \n\nTsui Hark, Ringo Lam and current favourite Johnnie To each used their own scripts and production teams to create 30 minutes of this crime drama. \n\nTsui Hark&apos;s first act establishes the characters, handing over to Ringo Lam for an intense second act and it&apos;s therefore down to Johnnie To to wrap things up in the chaotic final act. These are directors who know how to use conventions, such as the mcguffin, the chase and gunfight, but delight in adding unexpected twists to subvert our expectations.\n\nThe result is a surprisingly natural film experience. Distinctive styles, such as Tsui Hark&apos;s intense visuals, may make the audience aware of who is in control but generally it&apos;s almost impossible to determine which director&apos;s work we are watching at any given time. Cinematographer Cheng Siu-Keung deserves credit for maintaining a beautifully atmospheric tone throughout, even during the many unusual moments.\n\nAs is appropriate for a film with three directors there are three lead characters. Simon Yam, Louis Koo and Sun Honglei play desperate men planning a robbery when a mystery man approaches leaves in their possession a piece of gold which sends them in a new direction, toward buried treasure. \n\nIt&apos;s the set-up for a conventional heist movie, the kind of film we have seen many times before, but in the hands of these skilled artists it becomes much more. The triangle of the title can be interpreted to mean one or several things. Meaning extends beyond simply referring to the collaboration between the trio of filmmakers. \n\nIt can be said to refer to the three-stages to this story and the journey the audience accompanies the characters on. The poster art presents the words &quot;destiny&quot; &quot;jealousy&quot; and &quot;temptation&quot; on each side of the shape, hinting at a philosophical construction. Triangle is an ambiguous film from which we can take from what we wish.\n\nI was personally drawn to the &quot;love triangle&quot; interpretation. At the heart of the film is a woman, the wife of one of the criminals, who has been having an affair. For a notable three years. Awareness of the betrayal has a direct influence on the direction of the story and things become increasingly unpredictable. I&apos;m being intentionally vague about whose wife she is and with whom the affair is taking place as there are so many wonderful nuances and surprises in the narrative that it would be a shame to spoil them.\n\nSimon Yam, a serious actor with a surprising number of action films in his filmography including Wake of Death with Jean-Claude Van Damme, is a Johnnie To regular and it&apos;s his cold, emotionless performance which grips the audience most. From the moment he is introduced on screen we never know what to expect from him. \n\nLouis Koo (with whom Yam and To worked on the Election films) is also good as a small-time criminal getting in over his head with some nasty characters. The only weak link is Sun Hong Lei as an antique store owner who aids them in their heist. Too often off-screen and unmemorable when he is on it.\n\nTriangle is an intriguing piece of work. Those seeking a fast-paced thriller would be advised to look elsewhere, but if you enjoy slow- burning character studies then this will not disappoint.",

The movie and accompanying book claim to be primers in intellectual self-defense, which they certainly are but beyond that, they also serve to showcase the many talents of linguist/political dissident/writer/philosopher/professor Noam Chomsky.\n\nI&apos;m surprised the movie didn&apos;t win a Best Documentary Oscar, which it certainly should have, perhaps more than anything it just goes to show you that the contents of this movie probably strike too close to home and make the media elite squirm in their seats.\n\nTake 3 hours off some Sunday afternoon instead of watching the football game and WATCH THIS MOVIE, you won&apos;t regret it! The movie leaves you with an immense feeling of hope and a profound sense that each one of us can do something actively and constructively in order to make this a better world to live in. If you&apos;re apolitical now and/or politically inactive, you won&apos;t be after you watch this movie. Guaranteed.",

I went to see it anyway, as I&apos;ve always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.\n\nWhat i&apos;m saying is I couldn&apos;t get enough of this movie. It was so well done.\n\nJohnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.\n\nGeoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.\n\nKeira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor&apos;s daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.\n\nOrlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.\n\nThe more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You&apos;ll see what I mean when you watch it.\n\nThe story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner&apos;s child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.\n\nA great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book."

The dialogues are good, fast, the story credible and you will spend two hours very far from your usual problems... unless you are a man in his sixties.",

      "reviewBody": "With  two great titles (SON OF DJANGO and VENGEANCE IS A COLT 45), top-billed Guy Madison, and director Osvaldo Civirani at the helm (a man who has made quirky films in a number of genres--he sometimes misses the mark, but he takes chances), I had high hopes for this film.\n\nThe DEATH RIDES A HORSE-style opening sequence was quite exciting too, but the film that followed was a letdown. The pacing is flat, the lead character is neither interesting enough nor mysterious enough to command much attention, and Guy Madison, although top-billed, should really have been given &quot;and with the special participation of&quot; billing in the credits as he is essentially a guest star. Gabriele Tinti is the protagonist, and he basically stumbles from one scene to another, getting the tar knocked out of him, but not showing much of a distinctive character (Richard Harrison would provide wit as he went through such torment, Tomas Milian would spew contempt toward his tormentors, Craig Hill would command fear even after getting beaten temporarily). There are a few nicely composed shots, a few places where the music is haunting and we see Tinti riding alone, and of course Guy Madison is excellent as the gunslinging priest/minister who comes to Tinti&apos;s aid, but isn&apos;t exactly welcomed. This role is a bit different from Madison&apos;s later role in Reverend Colt, a much better film.\n\nThe &quot;climax&quot; of the film is quite unsatisfying too--I don&apos;t know if Tinti is to blame. Probably hurried writing and slack directing are responsible. Fortunately, AFTER the lame climax with Tinti, Madison&apos;s is the last face we see, so at least the film left a positive image in my mind.\n\nAlthough a &quot;revenge for a murdered father&quot; film, SON OF DJANGO features little tension and this viewer at least didn&apos;t really care whether Tinti got his revenge. There are probably a dozen Bob Steele westerns from the 1930s with a similar plot, and nine-tenths of them as I remember pulled me into Steele&apos;s quest for revenge. Not here.\n\nI can recommend the film only to Guy Madison collectors--he&apos;s fine here, although once again dubbed by someone else--and Eurowestern completists. And for the latter, I should say that this is not a BAD film, just an average one. It may well work for you, but didn&apos;t for me.",

      "reviewBody": "My first thought when I first watched this movie was of how similar it was to the writing styles of P.G. Wodehouse and the famous English playwright Oscar Wilde.  The storyline starts off deceptively simply and slowly builds in complexity until a frenetic climax explodes all over the viewer.  It is virtually impossible to try and explain the plot to someone because it simply has too many twists and turns.\n\nThis movie is an unusual one for Ms. Tripplehorne in that she plays a glamorous Grace Kelly/Marilyn Monroe-esque movie star instead of her usual supporting actress role.  I thought it was a lovely change and she did a stunning job capturing the mannerisms and acting style of the era.  The little movie clip of her and &quot;Don Lucas&quot; in the preposterously titled &apos;A Kiss in the Dark&apos; was so (very bad) Casablanca that I just had to laugh.\n\nThe story progressed beautifully with little touches of absurdity in just the right places, such as the poor unfortunate maid walking (read &apos;running&apos;) the dogs across the manor grounds.  And because good comedy comes in threes, we see her three times throughout the movie.\n\nBut for me, the real winner in this movie is Colin Firth&apos;s role as Peter, the ubiquitous nephew-in-residence.  His lines are delivered beautifully, but it is his facial expressions, and soft, unspoken mimicry of Miranda Frayle that really clinch it.  His smart-aleck remarks are tempered with just enough Britishness to keep them from being outright obnoxious.  It&apos;s lovely to see him in a role that must have been so much fun.\n\nOn the whole, I thought the movie was marvelous.  It&apos;s full of deliciously sketched characters, masterfully crafted dialogue, very effective camera work, beautiful costumes and props, and of course, ridiculous coincidences that serve to drive the plot towards its inevitable conclusion.  A great movie to enjoy yourself and also to recommend to your mother or anyone else with discriminating taste.",

Instead of concentrating on what the audience doesn&apos;t know and building up to a yawn-full climax, a cliché that Scream parodies, the film takes on the perspective of the psycho, presenting the audience with more information than other characters. \n\nThe obvious influences, or should I say homages, to Hitchcock show De Palma&apos;s respect for his predecessors, though it appears De Palma is also presenting us with a parody of Psycho, which is a reason in itself to watch this movie. \n\nAlong with other directors (Including Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg and Lucas), Brian De Palma has been labelled as a &apos;movie brat&apos;, and I think this film is a prime example of a film made by this generation of filmmakers.",

      "reviewBody": "Ernst Held (Gerhard Polt) is a simple fellow: he knows no greater joy than to compose and perform his passionate but not necessarily gifted poetry. Instead he is forced to work as clerk in a rural countryside hotel, owned by his stiff-lipped, upper-class wife (Christiane Hörbiger playing a rural version the character she played in &quot;Shtonk!&quot;). After a platonic affair with the local bimbo, Ernst finds himself cast out, his wife having revoked his financial privileges and wandering penniless in the streets Munich. He manages to con lunch out of gullible American tourists, eventually finding a job as waiter in a small corner-café, owned by the financially struggling Agnes.\n\nIn the meantime, Frau Held finds that 1,000 copies of Ernst&apos;s first poetic-epos has been delivered to her and that she is being footed with the bill. She goes off to Munich to find Ernst but Ernst, through a lucky twist of fate, has a first success in his poetic career: he manages to make his way into one of Munich&apos;s cynical and disillusioned publishing houses who turn this &quot;simpleton-poetry&quot; (intended as a joke for cynical and disillusioned intellectuals) into an instant bestseller. Ernst Held (the German word for &apos;hero&apos;) emerges victorious, his honour redeemed, his credit-card and sports car returned and his nagging wife for once silenced. At the zenith of success, Ernst does what every Bavarian male would do in such situation: he helps himself to a &apos;Maß&apos; (a litre of beer, served in a bucket-like glass) in a beer-garden end enjoys the sun shining into his face. The End of our hero&apos;s odyssey.\n\nGerhard Polt, in his directorial debut, has always relied on quality over mass. His film and TV-appearances are few and far between but always of the highest standard, humoristic ally brilliant but always with a serious, realistic background. Like his collaborations with Hanns-Christian Müller (&quot;Kehraus&quot;, &quot;Man spricht Deutsh&quot;), Polt only relies on reality to provide comedy. Yes, the viewer can laugh at the quirky, lovable characters and situation but the film is never structured like your average comedy. It could also be seen as a social commentary about a city and the mentality of the people that inhabit it; &quot;it just depends from which angle you look at it&quot;, as an old Bavarian saying goes.\n\nIn all fairness, the directorial skills of Polt are not as fluent and well paced as that of his partner Müller, making the movie a little stiffer than prior mentioned movies, hence never quiet being as brilliant.\n\nPeople unfamiliar or not interested in Munich and Bavarian culture and mentality in general, might not be able to understand the points this movie is making; it is purely a local affair. But if you&apos;re familiar with Polt&apos;s straight-faced, critical humour, or if you have an anthropological interest in the southern German mind, you&apos;ll find much &quot;insider-information&quot; in &quot;Herr Ober&quot;."

I thought this was a &quot;drama/thriller/fantasy&quot;, so i was prepared for something like that. Truth is, it&apos;s mislabelled. This is a drama. A &quot;heavy drama&quot;, i mean, it was tough to watch at times. There are some poetic/dream-like scenes but its core is realistic as it gets. Nothing wrong with these movies, but i was not in the mood. In any case, it&apos;s good. Viewer empathizes with the leading character, there is a strong, almost heartbreaking story and i was waiting for a payoff, because she faced too much adversity in her life. I won&apos;t say anything about the ending, i&apos;ll just say that i didn&apos;t expect it. Not satisfying or unsatisfying, just strange.\n\nGreat acting performances by everyone here.",

I&apos;ve seen others movies on the subject of time-travel but few that goes that deep into the subject and explaining it that well.\n\nIt&apos;s by no mean an easy movie to understand as a whole plot-wise because of the whole time-travel paradox , but it actually illustrate the complexity of it in a very elegant and subtle manner without too many shortcuts.\n\nThe movie has its flaws however,some of the plot devices related to the time-travel paradox seemed a little bit too convenient in my opinion, and the ending could have been better. But as a whole I liked the story even though I didn&apos;t understand all the details involved. There is also a nice little love story which actually fitted quite well in the overall plot.\n\nThe cyberpunk setting wasn&apos;t a bad idea for the movie, but I wished they had been a bit more subtle about it. Some of the scenes of the movies were almost screaming &quot;We bloody love Blade Runner&quot; at us. I still liked the style and music but I think it was a bit overdone.\n\nApart from Ironside all the actors are refreshingly unknown, and do a very good job given the complex story they play.I liked the characters which were both human and interesting.\n\nSynchronicity&apos;s story is by no mean easy to grasp , but I enjoyed it. It wasn&apos;t overly complicated but still gave me something to think about after watching it. I recommend this movie if you&apos;re in the mood for a bit more serious scifi.",

David soon falls in love with the lady of the house Christian Mariell, Kate Beckinsale, who meets him at the train station and drives him to the mansion.\n\nAt the spacious mansion David is introduced to Christina&apos;s two brothers the overly serious Robert, Anthony Andrews, and joker and in house comedian Simon, Alex Lowe, who together with Christina spend almost all their time doing nothing but partying around and skinny-dipping in the in the outdoor lake. Even though the astute David sees nothing supernatural in Nanny Webb&apos;s observations he does see that the Mariell children are somehow totally indifferent to her as if she doesn&apos;t even exist at all. As for Nanny Webb she&apos;s terrified of them even more then the ghost of Mrs. Mariell that she claims to be haunting the Mansion!\n\n***SPOILER ALERT*** David himself becomes convinced in Nanny Webb&apos;s statements of supernatural occurrences at the Mariell Mansion not by seeing the late Mrs. Mariell but in seeing his own long deceased twin sister Juliet, Victoria Shalet. Juliet is trying to get David to leave the premises before something very awful and terrible happens to him. Something that&apos;s been planned in advance to happen to David by the Mariell children who are not what they at first seem to be!\n\nNanny Webb has carried this terrible secret about what really happened to the late Mrs. Mariell since back on that cold February day in 1923. It was the circumstances of Mrs. Mariell&apos;s tragic death and what she did after that that has driven Nanny Webb to the brink of madness. A madness that was soon to engulf David Ash in a web of incest murder and arson that will change his opinions about haunted houses ghosts and the supernatural forever!",

The dogfight scenes were very convincing, although stock footage from &apos;The Blue Max&apos; was used in places, but only to add a sort of &apos;link&apos; to the footage you saw in the movie.  Stampe SV.4s made excellent substitutes for SE5As, but the Stearmans/Tiger Moths and Jungmeisters weren&apos;t exactly convincing.  But hey, who cares?  This is a top notch movie, with good performances and convincing setpieces.  See it, enjoy it!"

The film&apos;s other characters include Arvo&apos;s hulking mentally impaired brother Sulo (Mikko Kivinen), who likes to howl at the moon, their crazy old mother (Soli Labbart), and a cousin who works in a butcher shop.\n\nStylishly shot, making good use of the remote locale and the snowy landscape, The Moonlight Sonata is a great looking film with plenty of atmosphere, but suffers from a lack of gory violence. With just two protagonists (who are clearly going to survive) and one main villain, the film is virtually blood-free. It sorely needed Arvo&apos;s relatives to help him lay siege to the cottage, with Anni and Johannes dispatching their attackers in inventive and bloody ways (à la Straw Dogs), but the rest of Arvo&apos;s clan remain largely uninvolved. In fact, the only people to meet a grisly fate are a TV license man who is in the film for just a few minutes, Sulo sticking a sickle in the guy&apos;s head, and Arvo, who dies when his tractor explodes.\n\n4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for Björkman, who provides the film with some welcome gratuitous nudity.",

      "name": "A fun romp about girls wanting to lose their virginity... or something deeper?",
      "reviewBody": "At summer camp in the eastern USA, two girls (Kristy McNichol and Tatum O&apos;Neal) have a contest regarding who will lose their virginity first. Angel (McNichol) sets her eyes on a cool kid (Matt Dillon) at the boys&apos; camp across the lake while Ferris (O&apos;Neal) pursues an older camp counselor (Armand Assante).\n\nThis is a coming-of-age drama with some amusing touches, similar to &quot;The Summer of &apos;42&quot; (1971), except that it involves a group of girls during the summer of 1979 (when the film was shot). The first half has the girls meet at the buses, which take them to the camp, and the typical shenanigans thereof: Rivalry, friendship, borrowing a bus, meeting guys, stealing condoms, a food fight, swimming, canoeing and so on. It&apos;s similar to &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979) and all-around routine, although somewhat entertaining. My attention perked up in the second half where I found I had stumbled upon drama at its finest.\n\nDespite the set-up of the wager to see who can lose their virginity first, &quot;Little Darlings&quot; doesn&apos;t treat sex lightly. The scene where one of the girls says to a boy before (maybe) having sex for the first time: &quot;Right now. Do you care about me a little?&quot; This shows how little a gal will ask from a dude before giving it up.\n\nHer tears after the fact are also an authentic reaction, not to mention thoroughly convincing. It drove home the point that sex was a big deal and not something of which to take lightly. This is followed by the interesting irony of what the two girls TELL their friends and, even better, Angel &amp; Ferris&apos; potent meeting at the swing set with its refreshing transparency. The final scene and closing still are heartwarming as &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot; by the Bellamy Brothers plays over the credits.\n\nI know a lot of people see this flick as little more than a fun summer camp romp, like &quot;Meatballs,&quot; but those scenes are superb and represent drama &amp; cinema at their finest.\n\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot at Hard Labor Creek State Park, Rutledge, Georgia, as well as nearby Covington, Madison and Eatonton, Georgia.\n\nGRADE: B",

True, the man has done little worth one&apos;s time past the 80&apos;s, but he&apos;s fun to watch with only a few exceptions. The plot and writing in general is cliché-ridden... the best way to enjoy the film is really to avoid thinking about it, and just going with it. The action scenes are fairly well-done, and the cinematography is decent enough. Whether or not you enjoy the frequent jokes appearing early on regarding one particular characters identity is difficult to say... personally, I found them to be somewhat cute. The humor in general is fair. The dialog is okay, but not terribly memorable. The plot progression is good enough. The action isn&apos;t breaking any new ground, but it manages to be exciting and intense, and fairly well-edited, as well. The finale is quite good, very good tension. The acting is good... Rapaport and Murphy work well together, and Wincott makes a good villain(as Alien: Resurrection will tell you, he makes an awesome bad guy, criminal type). The romantic interest of Murphy works well... they&apos;ve got good on-screen chemistry, and their scenes together are credible. In conclusion; sure, we&apos;ve seen all this before... but it&apos;s still good for a fun two hours. I recommend this to big fans of action films and/or Eddie Murphy. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Whatever praise - and criticism - has been directed at this film in other comments here is pretty much right on. But the elements considered by some as flaws need not necessarily be bothersome; they aren&apos;t to me. That all of the supporting characters are rather broadly drawn caricatures works, I think, because it leaves Lemmon and Deneuve, at the heart of the story, the only seemingly real people in it, one might say. Isn&apos;t that the way love is sometimes? Maybe everyone around you thinks you&apos;re nuts (hence the title?), but to the smitten couple, the exact opposite seems the case.\n\nWhat we really have here is the late-60s equivalent of screwball romantic comedy. As such, it&apos;s full of colorful characters and unlikely situations, with a good dose of social satire thrown in - with marriage, in particular, under the microscope. We have high-powered executive Lawford and Deneuve, his neglected trophy wife; put-upon suburbanite Lemmon and Kellerman, his self-absorbed, psychobabble-spouting spouse; Weston trying to be the assertive &quot;man of the house&quot; with his bickering &quot;Mimsy;&quot; Loy and Boyer as the long-married and still very much in love eccentrics. But THE APRIL FOOLS isn&apos;t about marriage, of course; it&apos;s about love.\n\nIf you can find this picture, which is pretty hard to do as of this writing, it will reward with wonderful moments, delivered by a varied cast which pretty much represents the spectrum of players: the just-emerging Kellerman, Dillon and Mars; Lemmon, Lawford and Weston in their prime and old pros Boyer and Loy. Deneuve finds herself in an unfamiliar milieu here, but with her character that works in her favor. It&apos;s unexpected - and thoroughly amusing - when she suddenly lashes out at Mars: &quot;Leesen, if you toush me agayne, I&apos;ll geev you a sock-in-the-eye!&quot;\n\nMy favorite moment: Lemmon&apos;s awkward attempt to be suave and &quot;come on&quot; to a sexy blond at Lawford&apos;s swanky party. The payoff is priceless."

Julien and Florence plot a scheme to kill Simon simulating a suicide. Julien stays after-hours in the company with the telephone operator and the doorman and comes to his office. He climbs to Simon&apos;s office using a rope outside the window and kills the executive. He runs to his office to attend a phone call and forgets the rope, and leaves the building with the two employees to have an alibi. When he is ready to drive his car, he sees the rope hanging outside the building and he returns to withdraw the rope, leaving his overcoat and revolver in the car. When he enters in the lift, the doorman shutdown the building and Julien is trapped inside the elevator. \n\nMeanwhile the smalltime thief Louis (Georges Poujouly) steals Julien&apos;s car and drives to a motel with his girlfriend Véronique (Yori Bertin) and lodge using the name of Julien. They drink with the German tourists Horst Bencker (Iván Petrovich) and his wife Frieda Bencker (Elga Andersen) and early in the morning, Louis tries to steal his Mercedes Benz. When he is surprised by Horst, Louis shots and kills the couple. Julien Tavernier becomes the prime suspect of the murder and when he leaves the lift, he does not have alibi for the murder of Simon Carala and the German tourists. \n\n&quot;Ascenseur pour l&apos;Échafaud&quot; is the first feature of Louis Malle, who is also one of the writers. The unpredictable and original story is fantastic, the screenplay has many plot points until the very last scene and the performances are top-notch. \n\nJulien Tavernier is a methodic military with cold blood that gets caught between the rock and a hard place due to a mistake and lots of bad luck. The soundtrack with the music of Miles Davis gives a touch of class to this little masterpiece. The result is one of the best thrillers entwined with comedy of errors that I have ever seen. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Ascensor Para o Cadafalso&quot; (&quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot;)",

The only highlight of this movie consisted of the end credits - not because they were good, but because they marked the end of the movie.\n\nThe acting is bad, the characters are shallow and boring, and the monsters are laughable. The story centers around a giant komodo dragon which goes on an eating spree. If this weren&apos;t bad enough, the komodo dragon&apos;s saliva seems to turn those it touches into zombies! One of the problems is that there&apos;s only 1 komodo dragon and 2 zombies, and none of them are given much in the way of screen time. In other words, the majority of the movie is dialogue-based. This wouldn&apos;t have been a huge drawback if the dialogue hadn&apos;t been so bad. There were times I found myself tidying the room to pass the time, waiting for something interesting to happen. And when something did happen, it hardly warranted my attention.\n\nAt least the people on the island had what appeared to be unlimited ammunition and a small whiskey flask that never went empty....",

      "reviewBody": "I got this title as part of a cheap 100-movie sci-fi set. I&apos;m a big fan of 1970s exploitation cinema, and at first, I thought the film had some promise - it looks like it has some good creepy atmosphere, and it&apos;s Italian, so there&apos;s bound to be some gratuitous violence, gore, and nudity, despite cheesy special effects and a sketchy plot. What&apos;s more, even if it&apos;s stupid, it&apos;s bound to be entertaining!\n\nOkay, I was right about the cheesy effects and sketchy plot, but the rest? Not so much.\n\nThis is one of those films in that uncomfortable middle ground in the B-movie hierarchy – it&apos;s not sensational enough to be a guilty pleasure or awful enough to be unintentional comedy, yet it&apos;s far too incompetent to be considered good on its own merits.\n\nThe basic premise is that extraterrestrials are lurking around an unspecified location in the UK for reasons that are never entirely made clear. These aliens can make themselves invisible, but they apparently show up in photographs, as a photographer inadvertently takes pictures of them during a photo shoot with a beautiful female model in the woods. (Note to Italian exploitation fans: She remains fully clothed.) The photographer takes the photos to a journalist and complications ensue; the aliens pursue and abduct the photographer, killing a bystander in the process. The police and the military get involved. More people die. (Note to Italian exploitation fans: There is zero gore.) The journalist consults with a paranoid UFO researcher, and both of them wind up being pursued by shadowy government agents known as the Silencers, along with the aliens. It&apos;s basically like an extended episode of the X-Files.\n\nThe plot is full of holes and is nearly incoherent at times, which is not necessarily unusual for 70s Italian fare, but the filmmakers take far too long getting to the point. The screenplay and direction are limp and leaden for roughly the first hour of running time; there is virtually no sizzle or excitement until the third act, by which time the viewer is hardly paying attention. Like the American UFO researchers who apparently inspired this piece, the filmmakers evidently took themselves far too seriously to have any fun. \n\nIt would be neglectful of me not to explain the title of my review, and give some examples of the filmmaker&apos;s incompetence while I&apos;m at it:\n\n~ The sequences of the &quot;invisible&quot; aliens stalking the characters are filmed in the first person, using a fisheye lens, accompanied by a mindless droning high-pitched &quot;chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp&quot; synthesizer track and an occasional metallic heavy-breathing sound. As the aliens approach, the room lights go out, and the characters usually stand still rather than investigating why the lights went out as most normal people presumably would. (Note to Italian exploitation fans: Although the beautiful model is involved in these sequences, she remains fully clothed here too, and the aliens never do anything truly exciting like, say, beheading a character.) The director obviously intended for these sequences to be suspenseful, but he relies on them too much and drags them out far too long – one gets the sense that he was simply padding the movie&apos;s running time. What&apos;s worse, I could still hear the obnoxious &quot;chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp&quot; in my head the morning after watching the film.\n\n~ The film&apos;s British locale is never believable. Not only do none of the buildings look British, but the cars are left-hand drive, and characters&apos; offices and apartments are decorated with picturesque posters with British tourist attractions on them, making the sets look as if they were decorated by a travel agent – which they probably were.\n\n~ Important and potentially exciting plot points happen off-screen. Several deaths are either only discussed, or we only see the aftermath as the police are investigating. What&apos;s worse, most of the deaths that occur on-camera are dull – the aliens kill with mysterious &quot;radiation poisoning&quot; and the characters merely keel over. We also never actually see the aliens abduct a character; the abductions are merely implied by fast edits of flashing lights, the camera zooming in on the open door of the flying saucer, and the character appearing inside.\n\n~ The dubbing is truly awful, and annoyingly vacillates between spelling out the letters &quot;U-F-O&quot; and pronouncing it like an acronym, &quot;You-foe.&quot; The movie also features some of the most atrociously overblown, pretentious, and utterly nonsensical dialogue I&apos;ve heard since watching &apos;R.O.T.O.R.&apos; On the other hand, hearing Martin Balsam being voiced by another person who sounds nothing like him is rather novel and entertaining. (Mr. Balsam must have been really hard up for a paycheck at this point in his career.)\n\n~ The Silencers are some of the sloppiest secret agents in movie history; they travel in an enormous and conspicuous black Cadillac, frequently tailing other characters by only a few car lengths, and they hand off a &quot;secret&quot; audio tape in the middle of a city street in plain view of the character whose conversation they just recorded. In another sequence, the head Silencer dramatically puts on sunglasses indoors before shaking down a character, presumably to conceal his identity, but then he takes them off!\n\n~ When the journalist character finally goes Action Hero in the final act, it comes across as unbelievable, but at least this results in a beat-down sequence that&apos;s arguably the film&apos;s only high point for Italian exploitation fans (I won&apos;t spoil it for you).\n\n~ The ending is rather sudden, and was probably intended to be ironic and cynical, but it came across to me as lazy on the part of the screenwriter and director.\n\nFrankly, if you&apos;re looking for low-brow sci-fi thrills, I would skip this one.",

It&apos;s almost entirely composed of one shot, but as the TV production is shot on hand-held video, you can&apos;t expect anything approaching the great visual care of the director&apos;s later films, particularly once he found his mature style with &quot;Damnation&quot; and &quot;Satantango.&quot; The text is a drastic if effective-enough condensation of Shakespeare&apos;s play, the acting is decent, and it&apos;s interesting to see the lead in this role--I&apos;d mostly seen him previously in Miklos Jansco films, where he certainly got a lot of practice performing for an endlessly moving, in-your-face camera. Still, this production just isn&apos;t technically accomplished or atmospheric enough to be a memorable interpretation of the story, and it has no special angle beyond the one-shot novelty. (There is a much shorter 2nd shot, but I guess I blinked and missed the editorial transition.) For Bela Tarr enthusiasts, it&apos;s a footnote worth seeing...once. As far as screen &quot;Macbeths&quot; go, it&apos;s just one more pretty-good version--I don&apos;t think there&apos;s ever been a truly great one, not even Orson Welles&apos; or Polanski&apos;s.",

He is socially awkward and can&apos;t connect with anybody. Can he find the connection that he so desperately need? \n\nThis movie moves rather slowly. It meanders along as we follow Roman around. There isn&apos;t anything dramatic going on until the final third of the movie. So we&apos;re relying on this being a character study. A character study has major problems here. The actor is not charismatic and the character is supposed to be withdrawn. Again that doesn&apos;t make for compelling watching. A final reveal is very enlightening about his incarceration. However, I think a violent action scene at the beginning would inject much needed tension into this character. It would serve the movie much better to see the incident at the beginning rather than hear about it at the end.",

For the visuals and the music I&apos;d give it ten stars, and the script contains some great lines too, and the actors are all good-looking eye candy - it&apos;s just a pity that sometimes it feels that some emotion wasn&apos;t felt, just imitated.\n\nAll in all, the movie&apos;s like a holiday from reality - beautiful landscapes, wonderful costumes, and 2 actresses who look as good with nothing on as with something on, superb music, and a strange story that drags you in and puts you in a trance. It was a real ugly shock to come out of the cinema back to a gray and rainy city again.",

      "reviewBody": "Hyped to the heavens when it first came out as Schwarzenegger&apos;s comeback movie, this 1999 film steers the Governor away from his attempts at comedy and collaborations with Danny Devito and back into the sort of action packed carnage that made his name in the first place. However, where the likes of Commando had him portraying invincible supermen with a neat array of guns and one liners to hand, End of Days is considerably darker.\n\nSet in New York on the eve of Millennium, the film shows a version of the Austrian Oak previously never witnessed. He plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-Cop in charge of a security squad who finds himself embroiled in a battle to save a young girl (Robin Tunney) from being raped by the devil (a sadly, rather ineffective Gabriel Byrne) and bringing about Armageddon. As you do.\n\nCane himself is not the best sort of man for saving all creation either. He is mired in deep depression, has abandoned any faith in God he may have once had and when we first see him, is contemplating suicide. However, saving the girl gives him a drive and determination even when faced with some conflicting views from the Catholic Church about how best to go about this. All of this takes place in a very grim and gritty vision of New York where the rain never stops falling, urban decay is rife and pillars of steam rise from manhole covers. It is a fitting location for the end of all creation to begin and cast a dark veil over the flick.\n\nOf course, that isn&apos;t to say the film is all doom and gloom as there are a few glimpses of just how seriously the makers weren&apos;t taking their project (the argument between Arnold and Kevin Pollack in the former&apos;s apartment is hilarious). Plus, while the story and characters are all developed to match the atmosphere of impending dread during the first hour and a half, the last twenty minutes are made up of the kind of explosive action that strangely doesn&apos;t jar against the grimmer nature of the rest of the film, though the CGI devil at the climax is pushing it a little.\n\nAll in all, an enjoyable romp for fans of the Governator before his attention was diverted by a political career. It compares well to his classic eighties work by trying to do something different and while it may not gel properly in places, for a good 80% of the running time it does a very entertaining job.",

The film introduced me to Korean movies 13 years ago, and I&apos;ve loved them since.\n\nFor me the beauty of the film, based on history but with a romantic overlay, is its story of the young queen&apos;s devotion to duty, as well as the swordsman&apos;s devotion to honor-and protecting her. He will not leave her side, and she is equally brave and stalwart. It is the story of a woman&apos;s love of country and a swordsman&apos;s love of her. And it&apos;s achingly beautiful.",

It could have been much better too, only with less exaggeration. I have to say the young actors are doing a pretty good job. Apparently they have enough experience from the series. I watched this film to improve my Swedish rather than the sake of enjoying it, but I have to say it was quite enjoyable. Worth watching. Especially for those who feel like a flashback to their teens. 7/10 for this one.",

It is a good thing that Fritz Arno Wagner was behind the camera, although he could not prevent that when finally something resembling a plot is starting (with the arrival of Hans Nielsen as the financial saver), the story telling becomes untidy.\n\nThe main attraction remain the regulars of the cast: the both attractive Heidi Brühl and Angelika Meissner with their catching acting and both routinists Margarete Haagen and Paul Henckels.",

It had to have something to do with how the story unfolded. Turns out, that this is indeed the problem. The first 45 minutes of &quot;The I Inside&quot; are really a blast. The story sucks you in immediately and unfolds beautifully until a certain point is reached where the writer lost control and messed up what had been set up so well. All of a sudden the story&apos;s getting way over the top, apparently for no other reason than to keep the viewer puzzled. That wouldn&apos;t have been necessary. They could have taken the story anywhere as intriguing as it started. Unfortunately, the plot becomes uneven when the &quot;rules&quot; of the movie are adapted arbitrarily. The final solution doesn&apos;t really come as a surprise anymore. Worse still, it&apos;s not good enough to explain everything. It&apos;s obvious that there are mistakes and flaws throughout the script and it&apos;s a shame, because, as I&apos;ve said, unlike a lot of other movies where the story is already set up for an impossible, unbelievable ending, &quot;The I Inside&quot; had a more than promising start. Anyway, although the movie isn&apos;t completely satisfying and kind of stumbles over its own feet, it&apos;s still very entertaining to watch. It has an atmospheric stage play-like atmosphere (in fact, the story has been adapted from a play called &quot;Point Of Death&quot;) and there are some really creative suspense scenes. Summing up, &quot;The I Inside&quot; isn&apos;t the masterpiece it could have been, but it&apos;s a nice way to spend 90 minutes.",

Whether it meant to be so at the time is another question.&quot;  This is prime material for MST3K (very similar to &quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot;), but they might be avoiding &quot;Queen&quot; because it almost makes fun of itself.  It reeks of cardboard sets, silly dialogue, and more phallic symbols, hot babes, and sexual innuendo than you can wave a stick (or laser gun) at.  The astronauts ride in Lay-Z-Boy chairs and Zsa Zsa Gabor is a real treat.  Never taking itself seriously, it&apos;s the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; of the sci-fi genre."

But, I can only say that she must have needed the money, because this script is so abysmally bad and so far below her abilities. A high-schooler could have written this screenplay and done as good a job with a few of his/her classmates, an abandoned factory in the desert and some leftover storm trooper costumes from their last sci fi festival. Came so close to turning this off several times. Just a bad movie on so many levels and I cannot believe anyone financed this piece of junk. Listening to the rifle&apos;s AI voice, alone, was almost intolerable and who would have imagined that a notable martial artist could make a fight scene look laughable? Just stay away, it&apos;s not worth your time.",

      "name": "Spectacular, unadulterated Kim Ki-Duk",
      "reviewBody": "I often quote Kim Ki-Duk as my favourite director of all time, partly because of his prolific output (I&apos;m glad he numbers his films, I was losing count!) and his consistently emotional style. While I absolutely adore the &quot;new-wave&quot; Kim Ki-Duk (3-Iron, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter...And Spring, The Bow), I also thoroughly enjoy his earlier, grittier films (The Isle, Address Unknown). This film, his debut, is possibly the best and grittiest of the early films.\n\nIn a setting that stands somewhere between urban and rural, and filled with Kim Ki-Duk&apos;s beloved water motif, we see three misfits (a boy, the title character Crocodile and an elderly man) inexplicably living together on a platform under a bridge. Crocodile is an aggressive character with the shortest of fuses, and storms around as if the world owes him something. But there&apos;s another side to him. Intercuts show him diving in the nearby river for respite. When a young woman is seen drowning in the river, Crocodile rushes to her aid, only to expect a lot in return. Horrified by her treatment, she nonetheless returns frequently to bond with the old man and the young boy who remains uninfluenced by Crocodile&apos;s irritable nature. Soon she becomes a fixture and it all looks to be coming together for the group, if very vaguely. Add to this the most thrilling ending to a Kim Ki-Duk film I have seen so far and the film is complete.\n\nThis may not be for those of you who prefer his later works, but keep in mind it does contain everything a Kim Ki-Duk fan could wish for.",

      "name": "One More Triumph For Our Shirley",
      "reviewBody": "A small child, affectionately known as THE LITTLE PRINCESS, must endure great hardship after her father is killed in the Boer War.\n\nShirley Temple had her last great box-office triumph in this splendid Technicolor adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett childhood classic. No longer a tiny tot - she turned eleven the year THE LITTLE PRINCESS was released - but still a little trooper, Shirley exhibits once again the tremendous charm &amp; talent which made her Hollywood&apos;s top box office draw. With wrinkled brow &amp; tremulous lip or bouncing curls &amp; joyous smile, she adeptly displays just the right mood or mannerism to keep the focus of the audience&apos;s attention firmly grasped in her chubby fists.\n\nThe supporting players&apos; roster is abundantly well cast: stalwart Ian Hunter appears as Shirley&apos;s soldier father - this very fine actor wisely uses his acting skills to keep from being completely upstaged by the mighty moppet; handsome Richard Greene &amp; lovely Anita Louise play the riding master &amp; teacher who befriend Shirley - their roles aren&apos;t terribly significant, but they fill them quite well.\n\nMary Nash is once again cast as Shirley&apos;s tormentor, this time playing the evil-spirited headmistress of an exclusive girls&apos; seminary. This accomplished actress did not appear in many films, but she could generally be counted on to provide a vivid performance - notice the relish with which she essays her small part in the medieval fantasy sequence (`I know my rights, I know the law and what I say I saw, I saw!&apos;). Long-legged, adenoidal Arthur Treacher plays her henpecked brother; he is a delight during his two romps with Shirley to the music hall ditty Knocked Em In The Old Kent Road.&apos;\n\nCesar Romero quietly portrays an Indian servant in a small, but important, role; Miles Mander &amp; E. E. Clive both appear as hardhearted, crusty old gentlemen - only one is regenerated by film&apos;s end. Sweet Beryl Mercer makes the most of her few moments as a stately, kindhearted Queen Victoria - while Eily Malyon is a true fright as the school&apos;s slatternly cook. Marcia Mae Jones participates in one of the film&apos;s most memorable moments, when, as a particularly vile teenager, she receives a face full of fireplace ashes, courtesy of sweet Shirley.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to ten-year-old South African Sybil Jason, who plays the wistful waifish charmaid who idolizes Shirley. In her American film debut, Warner&apos;s LITTLE BIG SHOT (1935), she proved wonderfully winsome &amp; winning, but the storm of attention surrounding Miss Temple (exactly 19 months older than Miss Jason) tends, at this remove, to swamp the boats of the other female child stars of the period. However, delightful Sybil deserves to be remembered &amp; appreciated for her own accomplishments.\n\nThe Stolen Kiss, a lavish fantasy dream sequence, provides a welcome few minutes change of pace for Temple, Nash, Louise, Greene, Treacher &amp; Romero.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching Eddie Macon&apos;s Run and seeing what John Schneider had to go through in flashback in what landed him in Huntsville State Prison and his efforts on a second escape attempt, I concluded someone really does not like the great state of Texas. It&apos;s important to remember that Schneider moved his family from Florida to Texas because of promised good paying jobs with the oil industry. At that time Texas was booming because of oil, a lot of people went there like Schneider. \n\nBut Schneider who needs money badly because his young son has a rare blood disease finds himself working for peanuts because of some kickback scheme. When he protests and gets nasty about it, he gets tossed in jail for a five year rap. On his second attempt to escape he breaks out during the prison rodeo and he&apos;s got a good plan.\n\nHe&apos;s also got like Richard Kimble his own Lieutenant Gerard in Kirk Douglas who is less than impressed with the cowboy mentality of the place. He&apos;s from a civilized land called New Jersey and he brought in Schneider before and can do it again if for no other reason than to show the rest of the hicks good investigatory police work.\n\nOne of the few people that Schneider gets some sympathy from is heiress Lee Purcell. And she&apos;s helping him essentially for the thrill.\n\nSchneider with his devotion to his family was one of the more noble heroes of the Eighties cinema. We the audience hope that he makes it on his run from Huntsville to the Laredo border town. Eddie Macon&apos;s Run compares most favorably to those classics from Warner Brothers in the Thirties, The Life Of Jimmy Dolan and They Made Me A Criminal. And if you&apos;re familiar with those films you know how Eddie Macon&apos;s Run will turn out.",

      "reviewBody": "28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.\n\nUnfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende&apos;s rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. True, he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged Chile into economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. We&apos;ll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. The authors of the movie take a completely pro-Allende position, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him, or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by Castro. The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "I am an American PhD student based in both Japan and Micronesia doing extensive fieldwork with the survivors of the Pacific War in the Pacific Islands and Japan--as well as the families of war dead. Since I have been really involved most recently with the families of soldiers and sailors who died in the Pacific, I naturally wanted to see this movie.\n\nI found myself with tears in my eyes from the very beginning, because it was as if all the black and white photographs I have been generously shown by these families were coming to life--the young faces of these sailors, frightened, proud, and eager to live up to their responsibilities, were very true to what I sense was really happening in the 1940s. \n\nI have to say, unlike the very propagandist flavor of many American films about the Pacific War, including most recently &apos;Pearl Harbor,&apos; this film really delves into the traumatic aspects of masculinity in general and having to live up to &quot;being a man&quot; in Japan just as much as it celebrates the humanity of the people involved. Many American films, with the exception of &apos;Saving Private Ryan&apos; and several films about Vietnam, tend to stick to very comic-like stark depictions of heroes and villains and an overall sense of being &quot;victimized&quot; by the enemy. Here, the enemy is not the United States but rather masculinity and male pride itself, as well as the whole tragic story they create.\n\nAs such, it is a welcome remedy to way too much American-biased victory narratives that obscure the face of the Japanese military, and to films that portray menacing, dehumanized battalions of Japanese soldiers advancing forth without any legitimate context of their own. We see in this film the faces of these young men and understand what situation they were coming from.\n\nThat said, clearly the film was trying to be sensitive to war bereaved and to the official narratives of Japanese pretexts for war, and in that sense I feel they overdid it a little. We don&apos;t get a sense, for instance, about Japan&apos;s colonial presence throughout Asia and the Pacific--only the vague notion that Japan somehow got involved in war. Still, this isn&apos;t really a film about why the war happened, but rather about how it was to live and fight in the immediate time preceding Japanese surrender. In that sense, I do want to make the critique that this film really could have done with even MORE contextualization and solid research of popular Japanese culture at the time, because this would have added even more to its convincing sense of reality. For instance, the soundtrack would have been greatly enhanced with some of the evocative marching music and the ballads on the radio in the 1930s and 1940s that encouraged young men to join the navy and go south to the South Seas. \n\nThese songs are still sung even by the bereaved families who go back to visit the places where their loved ones died, so it would have been quite powerful if we got to hear them throughout the film. The absence of small details like this, some rather poorly-imitated Japanese regional dialects, and some of the melodramatic overacting by a few members of the cast, detracted somewhat from the overall production. But in general, this is a very fine film, extremely well acted (and compassionately so) by its cast. \n\nI have been reading a book about the film in Japanese and it&apos;s fascinating to learn how so many of the cast worked directly with Japanese veterans and the bereaved families in order to develop their characters and their behavior. So in many respects this film is not only based on the realities of battle (which are really just the backdrop) but on the real life realities of war and on being a young man in the Japanese Imperial Navy in 1944-1945. \n\nIn all, it&apos;s an extremely meaningful film that needs to be distributed widely through the world. I know there is a lot of resistance to its release in China and Korea, understandably, but I think this is a portrait of what was going on for Japanese at the time and as such could even work as a tool to facilitate better understanding in these countries. It is essential that more compassionate films like this are made that go on to address the complexity and horror of what happened in Asia and the Pacific-- to the people whose lives were colonized and ruined by Japanese aggression, but at least it&apos;s a start. It appears to me that Japanese popular culture is finally ready to address the war in all of its ugliness and begin to heal some of these old wounds.",

On the last day of school Vaek picks up his final report, but after that he takes his already packed bag and sets off for the Bohemian Forest without telling his parents. By this time, we already know that the little gamekeeper, knowledgeable and appreciative of the forest just like his grandfather, finds the prospect of spending the summer with his gamekeeper grandfather far more tempting than the seaside and we&apos;re happy to see him take this adventure. A friendly bus driver helps to deliver him to the right place and Straka is pleasantly surprised when Vaek appears and is happy to have his grandson at his side again. In the evening, a call comes from Vaek&apos;s mother, and the trip to Bulgaria is postponed.\n\nOnce again, Vaek and his grandfather have various experiences in the forest together. There is even a poacher on the loose and they work together to hunt him down. The film has more action than the first in the series and it ends with his mother coming a week before the end of summer so they can still have their family trip to Bulgaria. As they are saying their goodbye&apos;s, little Vaek receives a cute little gamekeeper&apos;s hound of his own announcing &quot;but now I can&apos;t go to Bulgaria!&quot;",

But his self-destructive ways cause his private life a lot of problems. Frank Sinatra is magnificent in the lead-role given great support by Eddie Albert,Jeanne Crain and especially by Beverly Garland,as Albert&apos;s wife. Sinatra had a magnificent hit-song from this movie with &quot;All the Way&quot;. One of my favorite recordings of his. It&apos;s a shame this movie isn&apos;t out on DVD. I hope Paramount will release this gem very soon.The movie should not be missed by any Sinatra fan.",

Ignoring such films as &quot;Platoon&quot; or &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (truly splendid examples of cinema within the genre) and also ignoring the first &quot;Rambo&quot; film (a movie I embarrasingly admit to having enjoyed), I have this suspicion that some shady, weasel-like producer in sunny So. California thought to himself &quot;Hey! I know how to make a quick buck! I&apos;ll screw a few investors outta a couple hundred grand and I&apos;ll make a, uhh... yeah! I&apos;ll make a &apos;Nam flick!&quot;\n\nPhuuleeze! Give it a rest, willya? The only people who would possibly find this movie worth watching are pre-pubescent little boys living in Idaho."

      "reviewBody": "Warren Beatty&apos;s Bulworth is one devastating satire on the political scene of the Clinton years. Sad to say things really ain&apos;t gotten any better here.\n\nJ. Billington Bulworth, Democratic Senator from California at one time rising liberal star has had to tack mighty heavily to the right in order to keep his office. Even at doing that he&apos;s facing a heavily financed rightwing opponent. \n\nWith defeat staring him in the face and no home life so to speak with both he and his wife pursuing the opposite sex, Bulworth just decides to chuck it all. His friends in the insurance industry are writing him one whopping life insurance policy and Bulworth hires a hit man to do him in. \n\nOf course no with nothing to lose our U.S. Senator who before mouthed the political platitudes and nostrums we get from our elected officials at voting time, now starts telling some uncomfortable truths. Lack of sleep and some controlled substances produce a rapping U.S. Senator who along the way picks up some black groupie types with Halle Berry. The consequences of all these hijinks you&apos;ll have to watch Bulworth for.\n\nOne friend has compared it Network and there are certainly some similarities. I think Bulworth should be seen back to back with Robert Redford&apos;s The Candidate. If you&apos;ll remember Redford was the idealistic liberal who trimmed his sails through the advice of his hired spin doctors and got himself elected U.S. Senator from California. His Bill MacKay was wondering what he does then at the end of that film. I think Bulworth provides some answers as to a possible direction MacKay might have taken.\n\nWarren Beatty wrote a witty script and a mean rap. Director Beatty gets some good performances by his cast and best in the supporting cast is his aide Oliver Platt who sees his whole career going down the tubes. There&apos;s a peculiar symbiotic relationship between Capitol Hill staffers and their bosses. They serve at the pleasure of, but at the same time a good one can make himself pretty valuable to his boss. Platt&apos;s such a guy, his character is quite authentic.\n\nRemember watch Bulworth back to back with The Candidate.",

Some movies are simply great because you get to spend time with your kids &amp; the flick has a redeeming message.\n\nThis movie has no sex, no language, and merely comedic violence. What a refreshing idea! I loved that my 13 year old boy &amp; 10 year old daughter enjoyed it &amp; both got the message that family is who loves you not whose blood runs in you.\n\nI would highly recommend this movie to anyone with children or to anyone who is sick of Hollywood &quot;morals&quot; being forced down our throats. A very family friendly movie.\n\nCome with a good attitude. Enjoy the popcorn &amp; a coke. Watch a decent flick &amp; enjoy time with your family.",

This one has a bit of trickery in its approach and will force you to pay attention to details as you get the story and characters straight.\n\nWith some similarities (but not quite at the level of) &quot;Swimming Pool&quot;, this one crawls inside the mind of a novelist and we are treated to quite a ride! Magicians, Serial Killers, Runaway husbands, Suicide, Murder, Romantic affairs, Pig slaughter, Family quarrels ... well you get the idea. This one has much to offer and will keep your attention as you attempt to assemble all the pieces.\n\nVery strong acting from Dominique Pinon as Laclos. Pinon is not in the Hollywood tradition of leading men, but he is fascinating to behold. Myriam Boyer as the female lead is very strong in her less than balanced character who tries desperately to please her mother. Fanny Ardant has the pivotal role of the famous novelist, Judith Ralitzer, whose next novel brings all the characters to the cross tracks.\n\nIf you enjoy a complicated, multi-faceted story line and some offbeat characters, then you will probably find the same level of enjoyment that I found.",

Priest Hossein falls in love with a lovely girl (Claude Jade ,Truffaut&apos;s protégée),he gets her pregnant,which ,in 1936 ,was scandalous .The main flaw is the depiction of the Relationship,which seems very natural;no stream of consciousness,the priest does not ask himself any questions,and ,as the other priest tells him :&quot;you are individualistic ,you do not see the world around you,what happens in Spain or in Germany ....&quot;\n\nThe scene with the bishop is revealing: our enemy is the communist ; Claude Piéplu ,who helps the generous communist mayor (Pierre Mondy),tells him so :&quot;for a priest,it&apos;s as dangerous to be with a commie as to be with a woman!&quot;;all that makes the epilogue all the more revolting .\n\nPerhaps the movie tackles too many subjects ,and sometimes the viewer forgets the main topic : &quot;if protestant ministers can have wife and children,why can&apos;t we?"

      "reviewBody": "I really like Jenna Elfman (Kate) as a comedienne. She generally does pretty well. She started off great in Looney Tunes searching for Daffy Duck to get him back to the studio, because her job depended on it. But then the plot morphs into Brendan Fraser (Drake) looking for his father and Elfman becomes simply a spectator in the second half of the movie. She becomes a prop on the set, rather than a character having something to do with the action.\n\nAfter her trip to Las Vegas in the film, Kate serves pretty much as a prop rather than as a character. She does throw a monkey wrench and puts a piece into a puzzle. But after the trip to Las Vegas, Ms. Elfman is mostly just a prop on the set. When the camera goes to her, she is simply standing there watching at Brendan Fraser (Drake) do his part. Fraser does pretty well. He does act through out, but in the second half of the film Elfman is simply a prop.\n\nI went to see this film as a fan of Ms. Elfman&apos;s. I heard Ms. Elfman on TV state that she wanted to do more films with Fraser. That will probably be a good thing. I know she can act as I have seen her in other films doing a great job. I think Elfman &amp; Fraser will make a good pair, but Elfman has got to do more acting and less spectating. The definition of &quot;act&quot; is &quot;do&quot;, not &quot;spectate&quot; or &quot;watch&quot;.\n\nI give the first half a 7 and the second half a 3 for an average of 5. After the first half I was just hoping it would end.",

I did not know about this film but somehow, through indirect references, I found out about it and decided to purchase a DVD to see it.\n\nAnd a good thing I have a DVD, for I needed to watch it more than once to truly grasp the gist of the film. The story line is based on a piece of history in the period of around 200 BC, toward the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is a story of allies turned mortal enemies, trust, mistrust, and the deadly outcome when a woman, here a queen, got involved in the King&apos;s decisions.\n\nThere are no epic battles and brutal action here, although there are a couple of scenes of torture and execution. The plot and pace are both slow. So I can see why many people will not like it. But if you have the patience, this is a visually impressive film that told a complex story. DVD is the best medium as you can pause, backtrack or watch it for a 2nd or 3rd time to fully understand the plot.",

An American Mormon missionary claimed to be abducted and raped by Ms. McKinney and what follows is a tragic but often funny documentary that is truly stranger than fiction. I can&apos;t find better adjectives(used by someone interviewed) than barking mad to describe this delusional, obsessed, and sorry figure.\n\nThe missing element is Kirk Anderson, the alleged victim and abductee, as he refused to be interviewed. Director Morris has a field day with Mormon beliefs, from magic underwear to planets ruled by deceased true believers. The Salt Lake City elders will not be pleased with this film. I highly recommend it to everyone else.",

      "reviewBody": "A year ago, if someone would have asked me &quot;What is your favorite movie ?&quot; , I would not have known what to answer exactly, maybe Fight Club, maybe Vertigo, Indiana Jones even would have come to my mind.\n\nSince June, I have but one answer: &apos;Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain&apos; !!! It is simply unique in his kind.  And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple &apos;feel-good movie&apos;.  It is so much more than that ! Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way.  Audrey&apos;s performance is simply stunning... she plays with an innocence, a wit, a smartness and naïvity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better. (please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman &amp; Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I&apos;m addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about &apos;accordeon jingle&apos;, please, get some education ;-). The story itself could easily have been abused, and I&apos;m sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.\n\nThis movie is for everyone who understands passion or who has lost his/her childhood somewhere along the way. If you love art &amp; music, sunshine &amp; poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)!\n\n Audrey is superb, Matthieu is better than himself, every actor gives a stunning performance, the scenery is beautiful, the whole movie is amusing, entertaining and charming, even CGI is perfectly done ! 10 out of 10 !!!\n\na 21-year-old Amélie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again",

      "reviewBody": "NTR is one of my favorite actor in Telugu film industry and I think he is one of the best-talented actors and I am a big fan of Telugu action masala film. Their hero&apos;s powerful introduction and super enjoyable action always fascinate me. I love their action, emotions and the way they execute both the emotions and the comedy. The thing which I enjoy most is the heroic entry of the main protagonist. the fight sequence and the punch dialogues are also very charming in Telugu cinema. \n\nIn this movie, NTR equally shines and he has done a very good job. No doubt he is the central character of this movie and all the other character around by him. The director chooses a very good story line. The story is a little bit choppy but as a masala film, it is an OK story. But NTRH is the heart of this movie and the story is totally concentrated only him. Another good point is Prakash Raj&apos;s acting. He is a very good actor and he has also done a wonderful job for the character of NTR&apos;a father. Rest of the cast is OK and they have nothing to shout about. The dialogues and the music are very imposing and sometimes very intriguing.\n\nIf you are a masala movie fan and want to watch some good action sequences this movie is for you. Bonus achievement is NTR&apos;s sensible acting.",

      "reviewBody": "While working in their village, a raped woman and her friend trying to help her cope with the situation find that the worse she gets it enables her to connect to a powerful legendary ghost figure who begins to kill off residents one-by-one and forces them to stop it.\n\nThis was an overall enjoyable and creepy effort which has a lot to like. One of the best aspects here is the fact that there&apos;s quite an effective and enjoyable atmosphere present here which makes the film far more suspenseful than it really should be. The early scenes in the forest where the villagers are out confronting the ghost who begins to wipe them out one-by-one while everyone continues searching works incredibly well due to the pitchforks illuminating the scene are rather enjoyable in setting this off on a great note, the funeral march through the forest where they carry the body along is rather eerie and the later trek through the forest encountering the different elements within the area makes for a rather nice time throughout here. With these all done concurrently to the other tribe members&apos; requests for the local tyranny to end as she experiences her visions connecting her to the creature all manage to make a somewhat decent start to this one. That all come to pass here in the later half where this one works in plenty of impressive and creepy set-pieces to really bring this kind of action to a greater whole, from the ghost appearing in the forest and tormenting the lone man by dancing around to entice him only to then learn the truth and get chased back into the village or a later attempt to track down a violator and continually reappears in the forest to block his escape which is a lot of fun to see play out. The finale, which deals with the possession and their efforts to cleanse if of her while still being in such a rage that it carries out some really freaky happenings in the control of the villagers&apos; bodies to carry out her plans, there&apos;s a nice series of wild and crazy action to occur which is what&apos;s needed in this segment of the film. Due to the vast majority of these scenes taking place in the middle of the forest with the villagers out looking for her by pitchfork, it&apos;s able to make that atmosphere come alive with the freaky-looking ghost taking advantage of the story about the true local legend effectively to capture an effective and eerie main villain within a creepy space for the action to take place, and overall there&apos;s a lot to like about this section. Even the frenetic finale, from the battle at the house to the encounter with the last tormentor while the house is being burnt down and him finally getting her to end her rampage this one really has quite a lot to like. While there&apos;s a lot of great elements present here, this one still has a few flaws to it. The biggest issue here is the fact that there&apos;s just not a whole lot of action to start this one off with as it focuses so much on the relationship woes between her and her husband following the incident which is traumatic enough but doesn&apos;t provide this with any kind of any real horror for long stretches of time as they just sit around complaining about what happened but nothing much else happens. Likewise, some of the effects are a little dodgy, but otherwise, there&apos;s not much else wrong here.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Violence, Language and Rape.",

      "reviewBody": "In the movie, the cultural difference between urban and rural life is usually depicted through the perspective of people in modernized city. Korean movies are now taking some serious actions toward their counterpart and blood-tied brothers- the northerners. Because of political sentimentalism, most northerner movies are composed of various historical/ethnic metaphor; but this one totally dispense with any nuance of political separatism/unification since its fundamental structure is centering on the cultural alienation and drive-me-crazy situation experienced by two elite North Korean Navy members.\n\nAs far as comedy is intended, this movie is the first trial to stage the northerner on the set of hyper-typified South Korean society. But its pitfall is that except for their northern accent, two heroes are not at all the very figures of North Korea but as much dumb as normal bumpkins from South Korean countryside. If this movie intended a sort of allegory for South Korean society, then it need not be scripted into a hilarious comedy; however, if intended for normal comedy, it need not employ two main characters from North Korea. As a result, this movie neither demonstrates the serious issues on the problem of Southern/Northern cultural hiatus, nor amuses the audiences with awkward slapsticks of two bumpkins.",

      "reviewBody": "It had been some time since I&apos;d seen the first two Hellraisers, and possibly the third, and I hadn&apos;t seen any of the other sequels. It seems like a lot of genre fans have overlooked these sequels as well, for whatever reason, while the Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels still seem to attract a fair amount of attention.\n\nLocal video stores have been selling off most of their videotapes cheaply, so I took advantage of this fact to pick up several of the Hellraiser sequels.\n\nI enjoyed this one. It does feature relatively little of the cenobites, which no doubt may irritate many (though not as much as if they were absent entirely!). The storyline in this one largely revolves around the questions: what happened? and what is real?\n\nI could see possibly picking up the series on DVD at the right price and watching them all through again. I&apos;m disappointed to hear the recent news that they&apos;re remaking the first one, though."

Mostly there&apos;s either a huge body count, some nice stylistic touches, or some over the top gun play to keep you going. This one, starring George Hilton (of Dinner with a vampire and Raiders of Atlantis), John Ireland (of Run Man Run and an episode of the Littlest Hobo) and George Mitchell (of Frankenstein 80 and Achtung! The Desert Tigers) kinds of keeps going over the same ground until the film ends.\n\nWhat I mean is, you&apos;ve got the usual bunch of folk after some gold (like Run Man Run) who keep double crossing each other or forging unlikely alliances (which happens so often in spaghetti westerns that it actually defies conventional mathematics by occurring in 107% of spaghetti westerns! How is that even possible?. However, this film just keeps doing that over and over and over again with little or no variation.\n\nSeriously. Someone has the gold hidden somewhere, others get together to get it, there&apos;s maybe a shoot out or a punch up, the gold ends up somewhere else, repeat until the non-ending.\n\nI&apos;ve watched a lot of Italian Westerns, and this is only the second that wasn&apos;t that great. It gets points for George Hilton being good (as usual), some nice comedic scenes, but that&apos;s about it. Put this way low on your &apos;watch list&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Adapted from the classic Dickens tale, Oliver Twist is the story of an idealistic orphan struggling to survive in a savage adult world. A world where hypocrisy, greed and cunning are celebrated and there are only rare glimpses of compassion.\n\nThe film focuses on the key events of the Dickens novel, excluding many of the subplots and associated characters. It opens with Oliver&apos;s (Barney Clark) arrival at the workhouse of &quot;Please Sir, can I have some more&quot; fame and follows his escape to London and its dingy underworld. Here he falls in with a band of pickpockets led by Fagin (Ben Kingsley) - a central character typifying hypocrisy, greed and cunning - but finds salvation in the form of Mr Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke) who recognizes the goodness in Oliver and endeavors to extract him from his, albeit unsuccessful, life of thievery.\n\nAs he did with his award-winning, &quot;The Pianist&quot;, Polanksi drew on his own life experiences as an orphan in the ghettos in World War II to recreate certain moods. Grim, grimy and often claustrophobic, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; startlingly depicts a callous world where children live at the whim of ruthless, self-serving adults. But the horror of this dark, unforgiving world is relieved by the inclusion of humour and banter throughout, making the film both captivating and entertaining.\n\nAs Oliver, Barney Clark exemplifies the helplessness of an innocent at the mercy of strangers and being manipulated for their benefit. As noted by Mr Sowerberry, the undertaker, &quot;There&apos;s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear, which is very interesting. He&apos;d make a delightful mute&quot;. And mute and incapacitated - be it through hunger, illness, injury and/or fear - he is for much of the film. Other than a surprising brief show of defiance that takes him from the coal shed and sets him on the road to London, there is little evidence of any determination, strength or willfulness at all in this Oliver. But unfortunately there is little to endear him either and the film suffers for it.\n\nHarry Eden has more depth and is much more compelling as the Artful Dodger. Plucky and likable, his struggle with the consequences of his betrayal of Nancy (Leanne Rowe) is agonising. Ben Kingsley is masterful and almost unrecognizable as Fagin. Depicted as pure evil in the novel, Polanksi strives to give this character humanity and meaning. The result is a foul, exploitative, groveling survivor a desperate and pitiful villain, but not a completely heartless one.\n\nThe elimination of many of the twists of the novel means that this film may disappoint viewers familiar with the intriguing undercurrents of Dickens&apos; plot and richness of his characters&apos; and their relationships. The only incredible discovery that Oliver makes in this version is that there is a better life to either the workhouse or the den of thieves.\n\nWhile adaptation to film necessitates simplification of the story and as Polanksi points out &quot;For today&apos;s taste, you need to abandon a certain amount of melodrama that was very typical for the period&quot;, it is easy to feel that in this paring down we have been left with an entertaining adventure set in 19th century Britain. When it comes to this Oliver, less is not more.",

Innovative, not exactly original: one can indeed detect the influence of any number of famous noir flicks, most notably D.O.A. But it&apos;s executed so perfectly that I wouldn&apos;t want to complain. My wife said that the film was rich in allusions to Bulgarian life and culture which went right past me. She is definitely not a genre fan but she really liked this movie. Certainly the best Bulgarian movie I&apos;ve seen since the magically-realistic anti-communist fable The Well.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an amazing film and it&apos;s sad it took so long to see the light of day. After all, it&apos;s an unaired TV special that features the Rolling Stones as well as performances by their friends--such as Jethro Tull, The Who and others. For fans of rock of this era, it truly is a must-see and is floating around on the internet. So why, then, do I give this show a 6? Well, because aside from lots of GREAT appearances, John and Yoko Ono show up as well and they actually let her &apos;sing&apos; (if you can call it that). Ono&apos;s singing, quite literally, is high-pitched screaming--well, more like screeching! It is, without a doubt, the most god-awful and terrible singing performance in the history of mankind and she makes no effort to actually sing--just scream like some ungodly creature! Hearing cats being skinned would be more pleasant to the ears!! It&apos;s so bad that when I taught history, I would occasionally show it to my students--as a punishment or to make them laugh (if used as punishment, I&apos;d have them watch ALL her singing)! But, if you can sit there with a remote control (either to fast-forward or turn down the volume), it&apos;s well worth seeing...and actually a great history lesson (the music, the outlandish styles, etcetera). And, if you are a glutton for punishment, it&apos;s a great laugh if your ears can take Ono&apos;s vocal talents! I wonder if they could use these portions at Guantanimo to interrogate prisoners! Nah...the Geneva Convention wouldn&apos;t allow such cruelty!",

The first skill is far harder to learn than the second. \n\nIn Orgasm Inc. Elizabeth Canner, far exceeds any other film maker I have ever seen in the former, and this more than makes up for the ever so slight failing of the the latter. Her ability to get people who have been trained to deal with the media and the public,who have practised for hours in delivering the company line, to then reveal, on camera, things that you can clearly see they know they shouldn&apos;t even tell their own mother, is phenomenal.\n\nAt first i thought it was just down to the fact that the original company she was hired to work for trusted her because they saw her as an employee, one of theirs so to speak, but she does it with almost every drug company rep and dodgy doctor she speaks with. \n\nThe story begins with one company&apos;s attempts to corner the market on a &quot;Cure&quot; for Female Sexual Dysfunction, but quickly moves to the question of if this is a real disease or not, then we see the competition&apos;s efforts and focus on one women&apos;s journey as a trialist for one of the products and finally the efforts of a campaign group in trying to convince the FDA not to approve a drug for this &quot;condition&quot;. \n\nCanner was granted access that will probably never be available again and she has used this privilege exceedingly well, my only complaint is that the sequencing and timing of certain scenes didn&apos;t work for me, she could have edited the material a little better to improve the overall flow. \n\nHowever unlike the ability to get people to reveal things they shouldn&apos;t, this is something that should improve in her work with experience.\n\nA film that needs a far wider audience than it will unfortunately ever get, Canner has all of the good qualities of Michael Moore, she champions the underdog battling against the big corporate giant, has a playful sense of humour, and an ability to make linear connections, however, she doesn&apos;t share his ego, aggressiveness or rudeness, she let&apos;s her subjects speak and lets them tell the story. \n\nFortunately for us, some may wish they never met her.",

She is picked up by Honza and Radek two friends who have recently acquired a beaten up old car which they CUSTOMIZE themselves, the result is a head-turning cabriolet. The aire libre feel of the car gives the director full licence to capture the passing countryside and quaint villages and towns. This film is visually a real gem. It has a FRENCH GENRE feel with odd moments such as Anna stopping at the side of the road to have a pee, a fact which she makes no attempt to hide. Long periods of silence are a perfect match for the greenery and the rustic/disrepaired buildings. During one stop we discover that Anna is the object of desire not only of the men she travels with but of a man in a sporty car.........a memorable ending follows"

Take the Rev. Blackwell, fighting to hold back his bursting enthusiasm for Jesus so as not to have another heart attack. Take the talkative lady who almost clashes with the fat woman with twins - haven&apos;t we seen them both in our churches? Take the Church Board representatives at the beginning of the film, I feel like I know a few like them! Take the elderly gentleman with the trumpet, struggling to play but doing it from his heart, I&apos;ve seen it. And in the midst of it, enter mega-star Billy Bob Thornton - blending into the mix just like one of the rest. Bottom line is, there is simply not one character that doesn&apos;t come across as believable simply by *being* there, even before you see them act.\n\nAcademy, awake, let there be a Casting Category now."

      "reviewBody": "From the Warring States Period going all the way back to the 5th century BC, wars have wracked China seemingly without pause. During the second half of the 19th century, and the late Qing/Ching/Manchu dynasty, some 50 million soldiers, bandits, and civilians died in the endless conflict.\n\nWatching &quot;Warlords,&quot; screened for the first time in North America Saturday night in the Castro Theater, part of the San Francisco International Film Festival, at times one might have thought that most of those casualties are shown - often in close-ups - in the film.\n\nBeginning with a view reminiscent of the Normandy invasion sequence of &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; the film by Peter Chan and Wai Man Yip depicts combat vividly and intensely. Chung Man Yee&apos;s production design peaks at times in virtually unprecedented battle-field spectacles.\n\nThere is no resolution, no peace, and only a quasi-relevant love story (featuring Jinglei Xu), but &quot;Warlords&quot; goes well beyond just fightin&apos; and killin&apos; and dyin&apos;. Right from the beginning, as Jet Li&apos;s General Pang picks himself up from under the bodies of his dead soldiers, you notice two things: Jet Li&apos;s complete lack of vanity and the ability of this martial-arts star to act convincingly and well.\n\nThe Manchu style of the head shaved in front and the hair gathered in a ponytail in the back looks hideous when it&apos;s all messed up, especially with blood. Jet Li not only appears half dead in his first appearance, but he is taking a bad-hair day to its absolute worst. And then, you also notice that Famous Jet Li - who is NOT flying through the air in this film - has been replaced by an honest and talented actor who brings to life a complex, conflicted, tragic character.\n\nWith shifting alliances, goals, and always at the edge of extinction, Pang and his two &quot;blood brothers,&quot; Takeshi Kaneshiro&apos;s soulful Jiang Wuyang and Andy Lau&apos;s towering Zhao Erhu (perhaps Lau&apos;s best-ever performance), struggle from small-time wars all the way to the taking of Nanking on behalf of the fast-fading central (so to speak) government in Beijing. The same history-based story has been told, in more modest terms, in Zhang Che&apos;s 1973 &quot;The Blood Brothers.&quot; A historical war film, a brutal but not gratuitously violent drama, &quot;Warlords&quot; impresses, even stuns, but in the end fails to provide catharsis or even an attempt to make sense of the senseless - something Zhang Yimou came close to in &quot;Hero&quot; (also with Jet Li, playing a similar historic character).",

Vladimir Vysotsky was the greatest poet, singer and actor of the 20&apos;th century (ok in Russia) and nobody can judge him without knowing what the person he was and what he did for Russian people. His original nature, inexhaustible energy and magic voice make everybody better whether you see him playing or hear him singing, it makes your heart melt and tears flow. Yes his life was not easy, he suffered on this earth like Jesus, he loved his motherland and he never tried to escape from that hell abroad like others did that time. But he couldn&apos;t feel himself free anywhere. That was his tragedy. But he was given the great gift - the great woman&apos;s love. Marina Vlady sacrificed her life and career and that was the most beautiful and fantastic love i&apos;ve seen ever. His lyrics are so strong and full of value, lots of themes like war, love, repression and human being. Just read his lyrics and maybe you&apos;ll understand Russian soul. Here in English my favourite song and lots of others with original rhymes http://www.wysotsky.com/1033.htm?521 I can write endlessly about this person and i will always lack the words to describe his nature, but you can read Marina&apos;s book and just have your own opinion about Vladimir Vysotsky or just listen to his songs and if your heart doesn&apos;t beat faster, well then this world is rolling the wrong way.. here are some links: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdCyOJf0v4A http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEum0Yhan4w http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e44k8mJv3t4&amp;feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRXaiy65SGw&amp;feature=related and the only video of that great love http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T3MILrOIAQ and finally here you can see Moscow in July 1980, when the Olympic games took place but everybody came to say good bye to him, though the funeral was not announced. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYrDvBX77KI&amp;feature=related"

After seeing it, as the credits started to roll, so did the tears down my face.\n\nIt surprises me that I never heard of this film when it came out as it&apos;s artistically a gem of a film. The acting is superb of very high caliber. It&apos;s got a twisted story in more ways than one, extremely compelling for those that appreciate a complex, tightly woven plot line.\n\nIf you have ever been betrayed by someone near/dear, this story will reach in on a visceral level and pull you in.\n\nThe overall message is powerful. It comes full circle from the extreme vulnerability to empowerment as it underscores the moral qualities and staying true to one&apos;s core values even in the face of overwhelming adversities.\n\nMy nephew is going through some hard times, I wish he could see this film today....\n\nMerry Christmas!",

      "reviewBody": "From what I&apos;ve heard, this is a fairly faithful adaption of the Stephen King story of the same name, but I&apos;ve never read the book myself. The plot is decent, but somewhat ridiculous... and the pacing is awful. I was bored for most of the other half of this movie, despite it only being about 90 minutes long. The acting varies, but it&apos;s mostly bad... Kari Wuhrer displays a particularly obvious lack of talent, and Robert John Burke proves that he doesn&apos;t have the charisma or talent to carry a movie. Actually, Joe Mantegna pretty much steals the show, and every scene that doesn&apos;t involve him has you bored and wanting to see him again. The humor in the film is actually surprisingly good. There are some pretty good exchanges of dialog, and, as a nice variation from the typical King film-adaption, most of the laughs are intentional(though there are a few parts which still seem lame and make you laugh, as opposed to seeming scary and frighten you). The special effects vary, but for the most part, they are quite good. The films gore and violence may be a little over the top, and is definitely extreme, though there isn&apos;t terribly much of it in the film(but when there is, it&apos;s very graphic), but it didn&apos;t bother me as much as I had expected, from hearing it described by someone who has seen the film. Since I haven&apos;t really seen any other films by the director, Tom Holland, I can&apos;t say if fans of him will like this film. One thing that the fans of King will surely enjoy is that he himself has a role in this, and a pretty easily recognizable one, at that(not the typical somewhere-in-the-immediate-background cameo that writers/directors typically have). All in all, fairly enjoyable horror, but not something that you&apos;ll want to see many times. I recommend it to big fans of Stephen King, huge fans of the various actors, and people who just enjoy watching somewhat uneven films just for the heck of it. 5/10",

In this picture J.C.V.D. plays the younger brother of a unbeaten American kick boxer who lusts for some real competition. So he decides to go to the home of Muay Thai kick boxing, Thailand. There he realizes that he doesn&apos;t know squat about the true art of kick boxing. He learns a painful lesson. His younger brother decides to learn Muay Thai and avenge his brother&apos;s honor.\n\nNot a bad movie. Entertaining and a good time waster. But for some reason the producers decided to franchise out this series. The rest of the films are a mixed bag at best. The more they made the least interesting they became until the final results were unwatchable. As always with these films the first film is usually the best of the bunch. Jean-Claude plays his character with a thick euro-accent (I forgot how they explained it). He&apos;s physically impressive so it&apos;s kind of hard to swallow his naiveté about fighting and what not. Or well. Fun for all.\n\nRecommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Match Point just joined Brokeback Mountain and Cinderella Man in the top three films for me this year. Like Brokeback Mountain, however, it is almost impossible to write a reasonably intelligent review without writing a spoiler.\n\nI have been a hot and cold Woody Allen watcher, but was only a fan during his comedic phase. So, despite hearing from a few reliable sources that this is Woody&apos;s masterpiece, I was skeptical and went in with few expectations. I am glad. Approaching the movie this way allowed it to creep up on me. \n\nThe NYC Jewish dialog is gone. The quirky sense of humor is nowhere to be found. the hypersensitivity is missing. Where&apos;s Woody? Well, he&apos;s in London, but the place and time, despite the opinions of some critics, are largely irrelevant in this film.\n\nThere is only one line in this film that indicates its origin - it has something to do with &apos;intertwined neuroses&apos; and nearly made me laugh. \n\nThe first 3/4ths of this film is almost completely taken up with character development, but also contains all of the basics of the inexorable plot that truly unfolds near the end. The characters are all quite likable, and, if you&apos;re like me, you will yearn for a happy ending. Watch out! - you&apos;ve just been hooked and Woody&apos;s about to reel you in! \n\nMatch Point draws its audience in quietly and slowly at first, defining its territory as a smart, hip, and sophisticated character study early on (in no way unexpected for Mr. Allen), but then it takes an irreversibly sinister turn as one man threatens to bring everybody we have grown to love and respect down with him. \n\nThe performances and cinematography in this film are all-around the best I&apos;ve seen this year. Allen uses a lot of very close-in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. I found no fault in the pace or the plot - this is easily Woody&apos;s most plot-heavy film, and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together. \n\nThe story line of Match Point is powerful, disturbing, and exceedingly clever. Philosophical folks will likely want to talk about it afterward. Some will find it frustrating and others will find it pretentious. Still others will point to Woody&apos;s own life and claim that this film is some form of perverse confession. Well, from my perspective, it is simply damn good story-telling.\n\nHighly recommended for adult audiences.",

      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s another great contender for my own personal award of &quot;Most Demented Film I ever watched&quot;, but the least I can say is that it was very interesting. &quot;The Pschotronic Man&quot; begins with the longest and most unnerving opening credits ever, but they&apos;re quite sinister and atmospheric what with the really creepy music and odd color schemes and everything. This is one of them rare films that already make you feel uncomfortable before it even properly takes off. The slow-paced story introduces Rocky Foscoe; a barber with a few issues that may or may not be caused by the fact that he consumes his own hair shampoos and conditioner lotions. Rocky starts having strange visions, like himself flying around in a car and such similar tomfoolery, and he gradually becomes the world&apos;s first and only Psychotronic Man. Basically, this just means that he&apos;s an older, fatter and sleazier male version of &quot;Carrie&quot; who can inflict stuff only by using his overdeveloped willpower. At first, Rocky doesn&apos;t comprehend the powers that have been granted to him and even seeks professional help to make the unbearable headaches go away, but then he gradually learns how to control his skills and use it against the people he doesn&apos;t like, like his own wife who&apos;s in the way of his love affairs. \n\n&quot;The Psychotronic Man&quot; is overall a pretty cool flick, but sadly director Jack M. Sell wasn&apos;t quite sure which narrative tone to maintain. Does this story require a dramatic, mysterious or exploitative tone? Or perhaps a combination of all three? This indecisive behavior leads to an illogical structure and uneven pacing, for example when a moody love-making sequence is immediately followed by an extremely violent murder vision. The film is also slow and uneventful. Especially considering the plot outline, they could have made this into a far more grotesque and trashy cult experiment; even bearing in mind the budgetary restrictions. The overlong chase sequence, for example, is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema. The cars just drive in straight lines and at snail pace, without tricky maneuvers or causing flamboyant accidents. Still, there&apos;s some greatness to find in this oddball production, like the creepy sound effects that are frequently repeated, including a church bell chiming and half the tune of Ennio Morricone&apos;s classic music for &quot;Once upon a time in the West&quot;. I bet the composer of this film was the only person who had great fun on set. \n\nBizarre film, to say the least, but it did offer us the collective term for everything in cult, horror and trash cinema that is unique and indescribable. Psychotronic power!",

      "reviewBody": "After 33 years things have certainly changed but this film still touches on issues that were very controversial back then and even now some of the events that take place are subject to debate. This story is about a young white entrepreneur named Elgar Enders (Beau Bridges) and he buys a New York tenement in a ghetto with plans on having the tenants move out so he can renovate it into his own place to live. He moves in and meets Marge (Pearl Bailey) who tells him about the people that live there and he finds out that many of the tenants owe back rent for several months. Elgar also meets Franny (Diana Sands) and they both seem to like each other but she is in love with Copee (Louis Gossett Jr.) who doesn&apos;t like Elgar and is always threatening him. Elgar gets a lot of flack from his parents and his mother Joyce (Lee Grant) who doesn&apos;t understand him says she will help him with new curtains. Elgar meets a light skinned black woman named Lanie (Marki Bey) and he falls in love and wants to marry her but Franny shows up at his door one day and tells him that she is pregnant with his child.\n\n This film was directed by the great Hal Ashby who makes his directorial debut after spending many years working as an editor. Ashby had worked on some of Norman Jewison&apos;s films and the two had become good friends. Jewison wanted to help Ashby on his first film and he was one of the producers. The script is sharply written and each character is very well detailed so that by the end of the film the viewer has a good understanding of each of them. The script does tackle racism and its look at on both perspectives of whites and blacks. Ashby uses colors to make points like the all white house and white clothing that the Enders have while the run down tenement that is occupied by mainly black residents has mainly gray tones with some of the interior shots having red. Along with the sharp script and direction this film has several very good performances in it. Lee Grant picked up an Oscar Nomination for her funny role as Bridges mother and the scene with her and Pearl Bailey is a classic. Bailey was making a rare film appearance and she would only appear in one more film until her death. Arguably the best performance comes from Sands. She shows so many layers to her character Franny and if a role ever deserved an Oscar Nomination it was this one. She&apos;s terrific here and sadly she would pass away from cancer only 4 years later. Bridges was still a very young actor when he was cast and even though he hadn&apos;t yet developed into the fine actor that he is today his performance is still sincere. Several up and coming actors appear in small roles like Susan Anspach, Robert Klein, Gloria Hendry, Trish Van Devere and Hector Elizondo. After all the time that has passed this film still comes across as poignant and pertinent.",

      "reviewBody": "Roger Corman&apos;s modestly-budgeted &quot;wheeler&quot; for American International Pictures opens brilliantly, with the evocative cinematography from Richard Moore promising more than what Corman, screenwriter Charles Griffith, or the cast can eventually deliver. Plot has Southern California biker gang enjoying rumbles, cycle jousts, hassling the Mexicans, and outrunning the local heat; but when Bruce Dern steals a police-bike and gets shot, gang &quot;president&quot; Peter Fonda hatches a plan to break him out of the hospital and thus keep him out of prison. The film looks terrific from start to finish, but the line-readings are sometimes so painful and awkward, one wishes Corman could cut back on the dialogue and just allow the visuals to tell the story. Sort of the older brother to &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;Angels&quot; was eclipsed in popularity and relevance just a few years later. Supporting cast includes Diane Ladd, Gayle Hunnicutt, Michael J. Pollard, and Nancy Sinatra, whose hospital crying scene is a hoot. *1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "Daytime television producers must love reality television shows; and by reality I don&apos;t mean Big Brother, Celebrity Love Island and other big &quot;event&quot; type shows, but rather the day to day stuff where cameras record life in airports, hospitals, with traffic police and so on. It is pretty cheap to make and thus it can effectively fill many of the hours that make up the non-primetime slots. With Animal Park, I was curious to see what it was about because surely it would lack the meat and potatoes of most of this sort of thing  the infighting, drama and stress between real people. Walk into any work place and you&apos;ll find rumours, gossip, infighting and so on, so it is just a matter of finding somewhere good and sticking the cameras in there.\n\nOf course, filming in an animal park does mostly remove the sort of stuff you get with airport-set shows but instead you have the dramas associated with looking after the animals. Whether it is surgery on animals, deaths, births and so on, Animal Park sets up the animals as characters themselves and follows them more than the staff. The idea is fine if you are a producer but I&apos;m not entirely sure how much value it has beyond filling the air time. I was vaguely interested in the episode I watched to get a feel of it, but really I had little interest beyond that. Ben Fogle and Kate Humble do their best to be all warm and excited about things and, in fairness, they work well on this level and at least it keeps reality-show &quot;star&quot; Fogle safely off our screens at any other time than 0900.\n\nFills the long daytime television hours cheaply and probably provides non-challenging distraction for housewives and elderly people kicking around the house on weekday mornings, but I serious doubt anyone goes to work and sets their video for this stuff."

      "name": "Unfunny comedic elements drag this film down.",
      "reviewBody": "Merging genres in a film is never an easy thing to do. The filmmaker runs the risk of losing his/her intended message or focus. This is never more true when we are taking about the horror and comedy genres. The two are so completely opposite of each other that it is nearly impossible to pull off a horror-comedy effectively. Sure, there are examples of getting right, but there are definitely more examples of getting it wrong. &quot;The Cook&quot; doesn&apos;t get it wrong, so to speak, but would have been a much better, more effective film had he director completely eliminated the comedic elements of the film.\n\nWe are introduced to a typical college sorority house. It is break time, and several of the girls decide to stick around the house and have their own little celebration. At the same time, a new cook arrives. Now, this is the first puzzling element of the film; the sorority house is no bigger than a typical two story house. It does not appear to be that fancy of a college campus, judging by the house and its surroundings, so why or how on earth do they have their own personal Hungarian cook??? Ahhh....tuition money well spent, I suppose. Also, where does he stay, since he always seems to be there? Would a sorority house really hire a male chef to stay with the girls alone over a break? Anyway, The Cook ends up being a homicidal maniac and begins to off the sorority sisters one by one and use them in his recipes. Yes, he serves the dead girls to their sorority sisters in various forms, including hamburgers and barbecue.\n\nThe Good: The film is at its best when it is working as a horror film. The Cook is a creepy killer and the death scenes pretty brutal and unrelenting. The killings are very reminiscent of the kills we saw in the early &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; sequels and the other more gory entries into the 80&apos;s slasher genre, which is probably on purpose, as one scene has two characters talking about a death scene in &quot;Friday the 13th Part 4&quot; as the film intercuts a female victim is being killed in the exact same manner by The Cook. The direction is pretty competent, particularly during the death scenes, and the acting a tad above average. The film did manage to keep my attention and didn&apos;t drag in any parts.\n\nThe Bad: The film is at its worse when it is working as a comedy. The characters are complete clichés and the screenwriter tries to use this alone to provide comic relief. There is badly written banter between some of the girls and a completely unnecessary subplot involving the resident &quot;badass-lesbian&quot; who seduces the innocent, bible-thumping religious girl. In fact, the screenwriter must have a thing for lesbianism, because there are several unnecessary scenes of girl-on-girl action, as if this a normal thing in sororities. Still, the comedic tones to the film (and they are present) really, at least for me, killed the pacing and effectiveness of the movie. Again, The Cook is such a brutal killer (except when the writer is apparently trying to have him be funny by blabbering and saying stupid stuff in Hungarian) that this could have really been a kick-ass slasher film. Instead, after any brutal kill, there are bad moments of comic relief. The dailogue is clunky, the characters complete clichés and underdeveloped. There is no final confrontation between killer and final girl and the ending is too predictable and unsatisfying.\n\nAnother horror-comedy that should have just been strictly horror. Take the comedic element out of this film and you actually have a pretty decent, gory, slasher film. However, as is, the comedic elements diminish the films tone and effectiveness and aren&apos;t even all the funny to begin with. Average at best, but had the potential to be much better.\n\nFrightMeter Grade: C",

      "reviewBody": "This is half-comical half-tragic, half-serious half-playful story of a long ago deteriorated to criminal life simple country lad, which after long years of wild living and countless jail sentences decides he can no longer bear this kind of life. He has poetic, high, even philosophical, truth-seeking soul, unique perspective on life, his own picturesque language, colorful, exhibitionist behavior. He doesn&apos;t feel comfortable in the surrounding world, he feels like a stranger both in the criminal and the normative cultures, and he feels his life is ruined. He is filled with bitterness and desire to lead a totally different sort of existence, but at first - at least make some big, beautiful gesture, succeed in having one real &quot;day of celebration&quot; in his sorrowful, mangled life. He also senses some underlying impropriety, pettiness, artificiality in the life of his society. The underside, or maybe the essence of the soviet living is painted in the film with a few skillful brush strokes. But he is also the one to blame in graphic confrontations with anyone he meets, because he is sure everyone is patronizing, underestimating him, and so he is trying to defend his honor. He is not strange to provocation. But he also tries to build bridges in his own awkward way, he tries to find understanding, and time after time faced with a cold response he is getting more and more angry. The point here has to do with more than the soviet society, it has to do with human nature and human life in general.\n\nDuring his time in prison he leads correspondence with a divorced woman, and short after his release heads to her village. This is very simple, innocent, gentle-hearted country girl which feels compassion and even love for Egor, the main character, intuitively sensing what lies deep down in the soul of this strange man. He comes to her house and starts living with her. The panicking reaction to his arrival of her family, friends and the whole village, and his attempt to deal with it are source of countless comical episodes, which characterize interesting truly Russian and truly Soviet types. His attempt to find a job there, what follows it, and the depiction of the soviet countryside in general are also comical and present it in a critical light. But this critique is not malicious, totally non-ideological, very unique, both totally non-venomous and full of anguish and depth. \n\nEgor tries to break his ties to the criminal world, but it doesn&apos;t let him go, his old acquaintances follow him. He tries to hide that from Luba, his new girlfriend. He generally doesn&apos;t like to disclose too much information about himself, doesn&apos;t like to talk about his past, he doesn&apos;t like when people try to peek at his soul. Parallelly he tries to repair the damage he has done over the years... He has many skeletons in his closet. Nearby lives his elderly mother, which has not heard from him for 20 years and thinks he had died. He meets his sister in the nearby city, but can&apos;t find enough strength in him to start talking to her.\n\nEgor feels strange kinship with one thing only - his little birch trees. For some reason this gentle and genuinely Russian tree draws from him feelings which no human being can. But even when he talks to his beloved birch trees he does not abandon his typical strange tone - simultaneously artistic, deliberate, and straightforward, sincere. He is a character and a half... He really doesn&apos;t know will he eventually be able to salvage his life, succeed in getting along with people, will he be able to open his heart to someone... But he isn&apos;t even given that slim chance. His old buddies hunt him down and shoot him.\n\nThis movie is not at all a moral parable about a honest man not getting along in a crooked society, nor a story of a fallen man asking for one last chance and not getting it, nor a story about one unique individual who can not find understanding of the ordinary folks. This is a rich, paradoxical, deep, honest story about the difficult life path of a complicated and troublesome human being that frantically searches for a glimpse of inner truth in himself and in others and has to deal with everything life has to throw at him. \n\nShukshin&apos;s acting is a whole other issue. It is simply out of this world, completely unique and immensely powerful, and can not be compared to anything else I&apos;ve seen.\n\nThis movie is very hard to categorize, it is very peculiar and unique, and it will be very hard for a non-Russian audience to understand it fully. This is a masterpiece however - a film unlike any other. Maybe it is only possible to sum it up by saying it is a creation of Shukshin - one of the most interesting Russian authors, and it is like himself - one of a kind.",

Even the putrid 2003 Detroit Kittens, the worst baseball team since the 1962 Mets, do better. It has no credibility as a romance. The jests aren&apos;t funny.\n\nThis movie will probably end up on the budget rack in some discount superstores because those stores have been cutting deals with movie companies to pump out as many movies as possible to sell for $6 or $7 as impulse items. Even for free it&apos;s no bargain; you have better uses of your time than this. \n\nIf you are collecting DVD&apos;s, then remember this basic rule: you are better off with one &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, or &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; than with four bad movies. Indeed you are better off with one great movie than with fifty bad movies. A bad CD is at worst background music that you don&apos;t have to pay much attention to; a bad DVD will disgust you.\n\nI rate this &quot;3 of 10&quot; because the only harm that this movie will do to you is waste your money and take up space better suited to some other purpose, such as getting a really good movie. I save the &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; for something completely devoid of production values, grossly objectionable, or a failure at its purpose.",

From phobias, realistic explanations of how they came to the conclusions they did, to a person using a multimeter and electrical tape to actually fix something. Like a real person might. And they all have their agendas. Also gunshots don&apos;t sound like tanks, and they don&apos;t make 10&quot; holes in people. There are no huge aliens, there&apos;s no gratuitous nudity and it doesn&apos;t take one chop with a cleaver to cut someones arm off. Another thing that surprised me is that bodies don&apos;t vanish, the same with tracks and bruises etc.\n\nIn most movies (*ahem* multi-million dollar productions) stuff like this, commonly called realism, is just glazed over. Your focus is shifted to the CGI and the huge explosions the MTV generation seems to love, like some magician distracting your attention so he can get away with tricking you (out of a good plot).\n\nAnyone who likes realism and thrillers/horror will probably have a jolly fine time watching this one. There&apos;s a bit of bad acting on the part of a few characters (though all the main ones are excellent), and as I stated the movie isn&apos;t miraculously good in any way. It&apos;s still better than most, and it has some really redeeming qualities to it.",

He asks the owner Ed Cunningham (John Ericson) to publish one-page advertisement for two days for his traveling circus. Ed has unrequited love for the widow librarian Angela Benedict (Barbara Eden) and opposes to the powerful rancher Clint Stark (Arthur O&apos;Connell) that wants to buy the lands of the inhabitants of Abalone. He uses the argument that the water supply pipe is decayed and needs to be replaced and it will be very expensive. However Stark has inside information that the railroad will pass by Abalone and will increase the value of the lands. There is a meeting in the town to decide whether the locals will sell their real estates to Stark or not but the decision is postponed after the arrival of Dr. Lao. During the night, the dwellers go to the circus to see The Abominable Snowman, Merlin the Magician, Apollonius of Tyana, Pan, The Giant Serpent and Medusa. Each attraction gives a lesson to each resident, changing their future and behavior for the better. \n\n&quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot; is a delightful and magic cult-movie, with a beautiful and entertaining story and great direction of George Pal. Tony Randall &quot;steals&quot; the movie performing seven different roles. Barbara &quot;Jeannie&quot; Eden is gorgeous and her encounter with Pan the God of Joy is wonderfully erotic. Apollonius of Tyana telling the truth about the future of his clients is hilarious. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;As 7 Faces do Dr. Lao&quot; (&quot;The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "In summer 2022 TCM is showing the recently extensively restored, full Cinerama image version of the film, which just came out on Blu-Ray. The image clarity and color are excellent, with almost no trace of 3 camera Cinerama distortions. But the movie itself is a mixed bag, with more negatives than positives. Anyone who is moderately savvy about film technique will see that the filmmakers were very limited by shortcomings with the Cinerama process. There are no close ups or medium close ups, everything is shot in long shots or medium shots. The large majority of the film is made up of static shots, where the camera does not move. The camera never moves side to side, only in and out. And there is very distracting fish eye distortion in the interior scenes (less noticeable in the outdoor scenes).\n\nLawrence Harvey is lively and fun in his role, but Karl Bohm is a liability. And how is it that one brother speaks with a British accent, and the other with a German accent ? The film makes good use of Russ Tamblin&apos;s tumbling ability and he shows plenty of playful energy. The women in the cast are given little to do and do it merely adequitely.\n\nThe music is a highlight, catchy and light, though to nitpick, the choral arrangements are old fashioned for 1962, sounding more like 1940&apos;s Disney (composer Lee Harline scored Pinochio and perhaps one or two other early 40&apos;s Disney features).",

      "reviewBody": "You wouldn&apos;t expect a Jess Franco Eurocine film called &apos;Shining Sex&apos; to be a chaste affair - you might well feel cheated if it was. Within moments, Lina Romay, who features prominently in every sense of the word, treats a surprisingly well-to-do audience to a sexual striptease, as the camera swoops in in unforgiving close-ups on every mole, every goose bump. She&apos;s also a very cheerful prostitute, and her exhibitionism still turned up to 11, goes off with a mysterious couple for a threesome.\n\nThe throes of anguish/ecstasy that fill the next few scenes begin to get tiresome, when the first tendrils of a storyline begin to reach out; at last things become interesting. The couple, Alpha and Andros (Evelyne Scott and Raymond Hardy) are far more mysterious than they initially seem, and Cynthia&apos;s (Romay) writhing takes on a different meaning.\n\nIt&apos;s reassuring to see some familiar faces - the always excellent Monica Swinn as Madame Pécame and Olivier Mathot as Elmos Kallman - although Swinn&apos;s character is suitably weird and distant and *far* from reassuring. Franco himself also features as good old Dr. Seward, whose voice is dubbed by someone reaching for his inner Peter Lorre!\n\nRomay is consistently wonderful in this. The transformation from her giggly, extroverted stripper, to seemingly emotionless pawn in the game being played, seems effortless and is highly convincing. Likewise, the shifting from sleazy 70s sex show to something quite different is very powerful - although there is always time for some graphically intimate shots of coupling. It&apos;s typically atypical in a Jess Franco film that features gratuitous amounts of female nudity and exploitation, that the female Alpha is fully in charge and Andros is very much her subordinate. An interesting wander into sci-fi territory for Uncle J. My score is 7 out of 10.",

It&apos;s not a laugh riot from beginning to end, but its gentle humor amused us, and we were interested enough in the characters to care about the story. This was actually 4 vignettes tied together by a common location. We actually were disappointed that some of the stories were left hanging, so to speak, and we were left to wonder about their characters. Another picky-picky complaint (and perhaps this was just our theater), was that the subtitles got lost in the white counter tops at the bottom of the screen. They were very difficult to read at times. Perhaps a different color font should have been used.",

If what you want are excellent performances from a superior cast, then this is your kind of movie. Robert Ryan gives his typical outstanding performance as an extremely cynical newspaper editor who inflicts his particular brand of misery to the full on his long-suffering wife, beautifully portrayed by Myrna Loy. Maureen Stapleton is electrifying in her movie debut and received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her riveting performance. Montomgery Clift&apos;s fragility works to his advantage here as an advice columnist whose sensitivity runs a little too deep. The haunted eyes and pained expressions perfectly match what the character in this situation would realistically feel and express. Overall, a nicely done, well-photographed film that is sure to hold the attention and is definitely worth the time to find and view.",

One week later, they make it to the audition as well as Kyle Davidson (Dermot Mulroney) and Linda Lue Linden (Sandra Bullock). Only James make it but the foursome start a friendship and more.\n\nThis Peter Bogdanovich film has four great young stars. In fact, River&apos;s star dims about a month after this movie&apos;s release. This seems to be set up to be a great movie. Although I like Mathis, Phoenix is probably the more compelling actor. It would be even crazier if Bullock got the Miranda Presley role. The stories are a bit soapy. The songs are fine. It&apos;s just great to see Phoenix before his early death and an up-and-coming Bullock. Otherwise, it doesn&apos;t standout more than that.",

What a great title, Night Of The Living Dead surely will attract horror and zombie geeks. And face it, Re-animator also is a big teaser. This is great.\n\nSadly the title is the only thing that is great. The acting by Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster) and Jeffrey Combs (Re-animator) was for me okay but the script itself had nothing to offer. There are here and there a few killings that are nice to see like the bashing of a head but most of the effects are pure cheap CGI. Just see for example one zombie being hit with acid, how stupid that CGI effect was. But it is really the story itself, there&apos;s too much of talking and there isn&apos;t anything happening. The zombies itself did look great in the beginning and looked gory and nasty but once the horde comes alive in the cellar it&apos;s as stupid as it good be. No effects or make-up. They did add some funny notes towards the geeks with referring to the Pittsburg outbreak in 1968 and the Romero zombies in the cellar.\n\nOn the other hand the scene were they are tripping do offers some necrophilia by Dyeanne (Robin Sydney) but again it is really a let down. I knew Robin from Wicked Lake (2008) and there she shows that she isn&apos;t afraid to show some flesh but here it&apos;s just a underwear girl sitting a top a zombie. \n\nJeff Broadstreet, the director, should have known better with already one NOTLD remake on his list, the 3D flop with Sid Haig. It is really weird with those two icons that they couldn&apos;t save this terrible flick, even familiar faces like Sarah Lieving (Cristie Forest) and Robin Sydney couldn&apos;t add anything towards this turkey. \n\nStill, it will sell due the icons and due the title but be warned that when you see Jeff&apos;s name on the list to leave it as it is. This is a perfect example how a title can sell a bad flick.\n\nGore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",

Of course it had dated badly in some ways, but not enough to spoil a modern viewer&apos;s enjoyment. Psychoanalysis was still quite a cinematic novelty at the time, but this means that we have to put up with an awkward opening sequence, complete with &quot;explanations&quot; on the screen, and a few pretty hokey moments throughout, but hey, I can live with that, and the amateurish filmed skiing scene. These few flaws, quite a rarity for Hitchcock, are still small potatoes. The legendary Salvador Dali designed dream sequence allegedly used very little of the great surrealists outlandish ideas, but even so it&apos;s striking and memorable. I also really enjoyed the inventive score by Miklos Rozsa, which utilized the eerie sound of the theremin, later used in the science fiction classic &apos;The Day The Earth Stood Still&apos;, and The Beach Boys psychedelic pop masterpiece &apos;Good Vibrations&apos;. Now the best thing about &apos;Spellbound&apos; and what really makes it into a wonderfully entertaining mystery/romance is Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. These two Golden Age superstars are both absolutely wonderful individually, but together they are magical, and one of THE great romantic couples in movie history. &apos;Spellbound&apos; may not be Hitchcock&apos;s very best work, but I still highly recommended it. I can&apos;t see how anyone could not enjoy it."

      "reviewBody": "The work of V. Schlöndorff and M. von Trotta deserves high praises, especially because of their ability to overcome the certain difficulties confronted whilst adapting a work of literature into a cinematic piece, or: from one branch of art (in)to another. To give a small example, Heinrich Böll&apos;s book adopts a first-person-plural-view/narration whereas the film refrains from this approach; the essence of a documentary such an approach provides, however, can be grasped instantaneously in the film, too. \n\nBeing successful on most aspects, The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum suffers from its shortness. 106 mins. have been cleverly used by the directors, mostly by delivering the spectators what ought to be delivered essentially, but they fail in providing the links and some necessary depths to the characters and/or relations. An additional 15 minutes could have helped the directors to grave both their and the film&apos;s name deeper and in larger fonts. \n\nI, for one, found the most fascinating part of the film to be shot in 1975: a year in which Ulrike M. Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe still lives; Holger Meins recently died of hunger(!); the West Germany is yet to experience what they term as The German Autumn by the 2nd generation RAF; the 1st gen. RAF members (leading members above) have not been tried yet by the time the book was published (maybe even by the time the film screened); the West Germany Police getting increasingly armed and offensive, and so on. Among all these, we witness the &quot;system&quot; founding and feeding itself -- as a matter of fact, nothing but its own self. The police, the officials, still prevalent pro-Nazism, and still-in-power former Nazis, the media, the social status, abuse, and oppression of the women... With the system ruling, firmly administering, and when necessary, fabricating all these tools, factors, manipulating the people, the viewer gains an insight into the closed loop that the person is trapped in. Seemingly, there is not a(n easy) way out; the ones leading to a hazy light turn out to be dead-ends. And here, the viewer begins to understand what the title really means, and how subtly it is the (condensed) narrative (of) itself. \n\nThese elements, pertaining to a &quot;tightly-screwed&quot; state system, all exist in the film but require a keen eye to catch them, let alone pondering on, given the length of the film. Despite its shortness, I believe that the adequate use of dialogues (even though sometimes they sound like irrelevant) and inconstant voices of characters, minute attention to decorations every here and there, Angela Winkler close-ups and her mimics, ... will convince the spectators that the directors pulled a good job, having come up with a worthy work.",

      "reviewBody": "Where Spiderman was colorful and almost cartoonish, Daredevil is gritty and merciless. Whatever you thought couldn&apos;t happen in Peter Parker&apos;s world will more than likely happen in Matt Murdock&apos;s neck of the woods. Because people die here. Sometimes they die slowly and painfully. The superheroes go home with scars on their backs, broken teeth, and more than a few gruesome images that need to be repressed. For all of these reasons I liked Daredevil, because it takes chances by offering a hero that is by no means invincible or conventional.\n\n The origin story of the character Daredevil is pretty complicated, but, as the helpful gentleman in the theater so aptly put it, &quot;He&apos;s blind, but he can see stuff blind.&quot; Let&apos;s just leave it at this: As a kid, Matt Murdock was blinded by radioactive material in a freak accident. This caused his other senses to become phenomenally acute, to the point where Matt can track criminals by their scent and use sound waves as a sort of radar. He uses his newfound abilities to protect those who will not be protected by the justice system, all the while hoping that one day he will find the person who killed his father.\n\n If you&apos;re a fan of the first two Batman movies, you&apos;ll find a lot to love in Daredevil. There are still some comic book elements that require some suspension of disbelief, like the fact that Matt could construct an entire high-tech lair beneath a church while working as a pro-bono lawyer, but the movie is not fantasy-driven. The fight scenes will make you wince at their realism, the love story is not corny or forced (as opposed to a certain flick called Just Married), and the characters are complex, uncertain people who just happen to don masks and fight on rooftops.\n\n Do you remember the parts in the old Christopher Reeve Superman movies where Clark would hear someone crying for help in the distance? He would always be having dinner with Lois Lane at the time, and had to make up some dumb excuse for ditching the scene like, &quot;Oh! I just forgot. I have a book due at the library.&quot; Then he would dash off to save the day, leaving Lois high and dry. Well, in today&apos;s feature, Matt hears someone crying for help, but when his love interest, Elektra, asks him to stay, he actually does. With out-of-left-field scenes like this, I couldn&apos;t help but enjoy Daredevil.\n\n Some might be surprised at how little screen time the villains get in this movie. Kingpin, a Don Giovini mobster type, and Bullseye, an Irish nut with a couple of loose screws, are important parts of our story, but they don&apos;t steal the show. Going back to the Batman comparison, many movie buffs think that Jack Nicholson&apos;s role as the joker actually become more interesting than the winged knight himself. Not so in this movie, as Daredevil is the guy whom the role shebang revolves around. By deciding to focus on the hero more than the villain, the audience can get into his head and root for him to the last battle. Matt is a cool guy because he&apos;s not a wealthy playboy or Kryptonian who can smash through walls. Other than his heightened senses and combat skills, he&apos;s just a regular guy who happens to like read leather.\n\n After X-Men and Spiderman became huge hits, it was expected that Hollywood would start churning out more superhero flicks as fast as they could make them. Thankfully, Daredevil doesn&apos;t seem recycled or rushed and actually brings something new to the table."

      "reviewBody": "The idea that a career driven woman finds herself disconnected from emotions, vacant in today&apos;s society, is the subject of at least one daytime television program daily. The presentation of Evelyn Stevens (Tilda Swinton, of Orlando fame) in Female Perversions, is not the sugar-coated world of The View, but a carefully crafted life-study (accurate to the minute details).\n\nEvelyn is an attractive woman, she believes herself a beautiful one. She inappropriately wonders through a shop while trying on a revealing piece of underwear, but the only one available is a disinterested octogenarian. She is a competent attorney, yet she represents herself as a premier legal strategist. Her credit card is rejected while making the simplest of purchases, she drives a SAAB 900 Turbo-the whole thing is perfect.\n\nFurther insight to Evelyn&apos;s internal monsters are seen though the film&apos;s portrayal of her sister, Madelyn-the good soul to Evelyn&apos;s evil one. She has chosen a more bohemian existence, and calms her internal monsters through adventures in kleptomania.\n\nLet&apos;s recap: Driven woman, faux life, dysfunctional family, bad credit cards, soon to be made a judge (with no one to tell, and no one who cares). There is only one place left for her to go.\n\nTo a deeply invested lesbian encounter. Where else can she go? Her entire life as it stands is moments from implosion. The realization that the new lawyer entering her firm (her replacement&apos;) is prettier (Paulina Porizkova, no less), smarter, and likely more stable further pushes Evelyn to the inevitable.\n\nWonderfully cast with Amy Madigan (as the sister), Karen Sillas (as the Doctor/Lesbian love interest), and Clancy Brown (as the boyfriend) in a rarely seen beefcake role. Throw in Frances Fisher and Laila Robins  for good measure.\n\nMust for all art film fans. Highly recommended for the more mainstream tastes who like a small distraction now and then."

      "reviewBody": "What we have here is a simple, claustrophobic little movie that works thanks to its focus on nastiness on an intriguing surreal atmosphere that constantly intrudes on the sex-charged plot line. The film is a Scandinavian co-production, and this makes it all the more interesting as there aren&apos;t a great deal of successful horror movies hailing from this part of the world. The film is short running at just seventy two minutes, but this is definitely a good thing if you ask me as too many films bog themselves down with any number of needless subplots, whereas Next Door keeps it short and sweet, with just the central major subplot taking a central role. The plot focuses on John, a man who has just been left by his girlfriend, for slightly hazy reasons. Left alone in his apartment, he soon bumps into his neighbours - a couple of sexy women who seem all too interested in him. As things start to get more and more weird, it soon becomes apparent that not everything is as it seems...\n\nI&apos;d heard that Next Door was one of the nastiest films in years - and while I now think that was said by someone who hasn&apos;t spent a lot of time checking out the pleasures of cult exploitation cinema, it has to be said that Next Door isn&apos;t really for the feint of heart. The film features sex and violence, and some of the time it features together - which will no doubt please the BBFC no end when they get their filthy mits on the film. The production values are high quality, however, and while the film doesn&apos;t feature anything that would cut into a low budget - the crisp cinematography wins it an extra helping of credibility for sure. The acting is also rather good, and the central four actors fit into their respective roles nicely. Director Pål Sletaune obviously has a respect for this sort of film, and the fact that he is keen to implement as much tension and mystery as possible is definitely to the film&apos;s credit. Overall, I wouldn&apos;t go as far as to say that Next Door is to the standard of a lot of the classic exploitation films  but it&apos;s very good for a modern film, and horror fans won&apos;t want to miss it.",

      "reviewBody": "The story takes place just after WW1. A right wing government has taken over after a short lived communist government. A young left wing leader is hiding at a farm where women behave like victims (which they are) but at the same time they are plotting against the arrogant and stupid men in power. Men who are proud of the fact that they would kill their own father if they were ordered to do so. In this right wing culture the capacity to obey is a bigger virtue than the capacity to love.\n\nMiklós Jancsó is dealing with the same themes in this film as in The Red and the White (1967) and The Round-Up (1966). It is shot in the same style and is just as pessimistic. Silence and Cry is however far from as hard hitting as the other two. It is only 73 minutes long but I got restless while watching it. I felt Miklós Jancsó was just repeating himself here with nothing new or clever to say about misuse of power. It is only at the end of the film that something of interest starts to happen.\n\nIt is a little strange that this does not work as well as the other ones since this has more of a plot. Maybe the problem is that the plot is revealed too late. For most of the time we don&apos;t know what is happening and we don&apos;t get these wonderful atmosphere scenes as in The Round-Up and The Red and the White. We know there is a story here but we are never really a part of it (or at least I was not).",

It takes guts to get hit by a tidal wave machine, go up against Butterbean and eat a urine-soaked sno-cone. While many will attribute this as a factor to the continuing downfall of society, at least it was damn funny (even with multiple viewings). Never has a film actually induced me to nearly vomit.

More like a melodrama bordering on a drama but for the presence of John Barrymore, Jr. It had a great cast with lots off recognizable names and the director was Fritz Lang.\n\nI just thought it wasn&apos;t up to the lofty standard set by Lang in earlier films like &apos;M&quot; and &quot;The Testament Of Dr. Mabuse&quot;, but truth be told, these pictures were made many years before this one. Too much dialogue here, and this picture dearly needed an injection of excitement to break the tedium of the love stories in the sub-plot.\n\nI like Dana Andrews, Thomas Mitchell, George Sanders, et al. A big boost was provided by Ida Lupino, always professional, as a sleep-around newspaper columnist. I also felt Barrymore tended toward ham in his portrayal of the psycho killer. My overall impression is of a master director who was losing his fastball, which is a shame. It could have been so much better.\n\n5/10 - Website no longer prints my star rating."

Pulls you in with its stylish direction and flamboyant visuals, but the two leads have poor chemistry, character development is almost nonexistent, and the film drags on from one convoluted plot twist to the next. Action scenes provide a spark every once in a while, but overall the film is frustrating and never provides one single reason to care about any of its characters! A disappointment considering the cast and crew involved. **"

      "reviewBody": "Few directors working today in America have mastered form like the Coens, I discover this with every new film they make. True Grit is a commercial film made to please but I don&apos;t see a compromise in the making and it&apos;s still a distinctly Coen film if you pay notice. Try to take out the Coen character from the film and the film breaks apart, it&apos;s that tightly woven in the fabric of it.\n\nA Coen film works for me in the face of it, but I&apos;m always on the lookout for what goes on behind, for the unseen cogs that grind out the fates of their characters. As with No Country, I came to this film looking to see is there a statement on violence, does it happen in a certain way and is the universe indifferent to it, is life worth a damn?\n\nThis one here works very much like the Henry Hathaway film from &apos;69, except everyone&apos;s better, where John Wayne played a character, Jeff Bridges plays a man, and even Barry Pepper betters my beloved Robert Duvall&apos;s turn as Ned Pepper. This probably won&apos;t do it for Jeff Bridges because we&apos;ve been accustomed to expect a certain degree of po-faced seriousness from a great performance (he snarled and staggered in Crazy Heart but he was serious about it), but he&apos;s one of the great actors of our times and I find this again in his Rooster Cogburn. Clint Eastwood also fell from a horse in Unforgiven and couldn&apos;t shoot a tin can to save his soul, but Munny &quot;was&quot; a scumbag, Cogburn still is and I like that. I like the courtroom scene where it&apos;s gradually revealed that he won&apos;t only bushwack those he needs to bring to justice, he will lie to make himself out to be the hero.\n\nAnother interesting aspect here is how the concept of the gunslinger and the western with it has evolved. When John Wayne played Cogburn in the Hathaway film the reward for the audience was the smirk of watching John Wayne be that drunken failure. The casting mattered in our appreciation. In the remake, most comments seem to point out that it&apos;s a fairly traditional/entertaining western. The dastardly revisit of something that was revisionist in the 70&apos;s oddly seems to give, in our day, a traditional western. We&apos;ve been accustomed to heroes who are not heroes, and maybe the erosion of that heroic archetype says something about the way we view the world now, as opposed to 30-40 years ago. Then we were beginning to realize that wars are not gloriously, justly won but survived and endured, now we know there is no clear struggle between dual opposites and have grown disenchanted as that knowledge has failed to prevent the same wars. Now we know there is stuff about the legends that don&apos;t make the print, or we are suspicious enough about legends to imagine them.\n\nIs this a traditional western then? Watching True Grit through the eyes of the brass 14yo girl reminded me of Winter&apos;s Bone, another film from the same year. In both cases a young girl is determined to plunge herself in a dark world of hurt and walk a path fraught with perils on all sides to achieve a moral purpose, both films maintain an appearance of realism, but what I get from them is a magical fantasy. This becomes more apparent when Mattie falls in the snakepit, but what about the hanged men who are really hanged high? The Hathaway film, ostensibly based on the same material, missed that note and played out a straight western. The Coen film unfolds as a hazy dream of that West. Although I wished for more open landscapes, it makes sense then that film narrows our gaze and clouds the margins. Perhaps we are even seeing the film as Mattie relives the experience in her old age, an affair shaped by memory and time.\n\nThis is the marvellous touch effected by the Coens on the material; the minute recreation of the Old West as a historical place and the odd, incongruous moments found within it annihilate any authority over the material.\n\nThe epilogue is important in that aspect.\n\nIt&apos;s not only that Mattie&apos;s revenge didn&apos;t accomplish anything, that it was for her merely another practical inconvenience to be bargained, paid for, and settled, like her father&apos;s ponies and saddle or the service of the US Marshall before, but that she clings to the memory of it so fiercely. What&apos;s horrifying then is not so much the violence of the West but the idealization of that violence. The film closes in a time around the turn of the century, people like Cogburn roosted in Wild West shows for a cheering audience, and Mattie is one of the people who lived to tell the tales. Out of those tales, the western of John Ford and Raoul Walsh emerged to print the legend. In a roundabout fantastic way, the Coens give us the true account, the creation myth behind the western."

The life of the husband and wife is thrown into turmoil when a young woman comes to work as a maid. If you thought &quot;The Housemaid&quot; was over-the-top, this one will blow your socks off! This film is flat-out ridiculous, but its also oddly riveting and blackly comical. There are some laugh-out-loud moments to be found here, especially near the end. There are also some eye-pleasing sets and more atmospheric architecture, with lots and lots of ticking clocks. The visual style of the film really won me over and made it a very engaging experience. \n\nThis is the most entertaining of the &quot;Housemaid&quot; installments and I&apos;d go so far as to say that it&apos;s the most entertaining pre-1990 South Korean film I&apos;ve seen to this point. Definitely worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth made five films together, but when they are talked of as a screen team, it&apos;s only Gilda that people are really talking about. Their first film was before World War II, The Lady in Question where both are young Columbia contract players who were in the same film and no effort was made to bill them as a team. The Loves of Carmen which was made after Gilda was a disaster for Glenn Ford, though Rita was at her sexiest. Affair in Trinidad was a good effort to recapture the magic of Gilda after Rita&apos;s storm marriage to Aly Khan and the last film The Money Trap was a Glenn Ford film where Rita has a brief role as an old girl friend. She was the best thing in that film by far.\n\nDo you remember in Cabaret how both the Liza Minnelli and Michael York characters find out they are sex partners to the same German bi-sexual man? That&apos;s essentially what happens in Gilda though with the Code firmly in place it&apos;s not something we talk about. George MacReady, a man of many interests rescues Glenn Ford from the docks of Buenos Aires after he&apos;s won some money from sailors in a crap game. They hit it off and Ford becomes his right hand man in running the casino MacReady operates.\n\nThen MacReady brings home a wife and lo and behold it turns out to be an old girl friend of Ford&apos;s, Rita Hayworth. Add to that some Nazi refugees have some business with MacReady over some tungsten mines. \n\nThe real emphasis in this film is sex and personified by the best embodiment of sex ever on the silver screen. This film raked in a lot of dollars for Harry Cohn and Columbia Pictures. Hayworth, voice dubbed as usual, had a big number here in Put the Blame on Mame. It became a signature tune for her the rest of her life. \n\nOne thing did disappoint me about Gilda. For a story that took place in Buenos Aires who many say is the most beautiful city in the world, it would have been nice to see some location shots, even if it was just some newsreels to establish the time and place. The film might as well have been in Albuquerque. \n\nBut when you&apos;ve got Rita to look at, it could be at the South Pole.",

      "reviewBody": "Jess Franco&apos;s &quot;Killer Barbys&quot; is to the band The Killer Barbies what Aki Kaurismäki&apos;s &quot;Leningrad Cowboys go to America&quot; was to the Leningrad Cowboys. Both are movies starring an existing band and both are typical products of the directors. Kaurismäki is known for his deadpan black humor presented in films totally weirding you out and &quot;Leningrad Cowboys go to America&quot; is a weird and funny tale of the Leningrad Cowboys going to America. Franco is known for erotic horror movies and &quot;Killer Barbys&quot; is a mix of horny rockers and cannibalists.\n\nBut there&apos;s more. Kaurismäki made a sequel, &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses&quot;, an attempt to make the worst movie ever. To a certain degree he succeeds in doing so. Franco&apos;s &quot;Killer Barbys&quot; doesn&apos;t try to do so, but it&apos;s difficult not to see how many horror cliches you can see in this film: at night you hear the sound of wearwolves, it&apos;s often twelve o&apos;clock, there&apos;s cannibalism, there are some dwarves, most of the rockers constantly want sex, a semi-naked girl is being chased in the woods, there&apos;s lot of blood and someone even ends up being crushed. How much gore can you get into one movie?\n\nBut movies like &quot;Killer Barbys&quot; and &quot;Leningrad Cowboys&quot; never meant to be original. They are mainly there to let you know the band exists. And if anything they are much more enjoyable than your average rockumentary. And even though Franco made lots of no-budget movies where anyone can see through the special effects, I suspect him here of making the effects as bad as possible (if you can&apos;t see that the dead bodies are dummies, you desperately need to get your eyes checked.)\n\nIt is true that Franco could have tried harder and that the movie could have been better, but it&apos;s common knowledge that Franco&apos;s best movies can&apos;t be found in the nineties. Most of those movies are even badly acted, so it&apos;s very ironic to realise that two rockers act better than Franco&apos;s cast of regulars (Lina Romay, Linnea Quigley, ...). &quot;Killer Barbys&quot; is the only decent movie Franco recently made, so if you want to see some of his later work, this is the best choice you can make. As long as you remember it&apos;s a Frankenstein experiment of combining gore and rockumentaries.\n\nBy the way &quot;Love Killer&quot; is a nice song.",

      "reviewBody": "In the early days of sound films, studios really didn&apos;t know how to use the new medium. Instead of normal speaking voices and normal actors, Hollywood felt a need to overwhelm the audience with sound. A lot of vaudeville comics who spoke a mile a minute were shoved in front of the cameras to take advantage of the fact that audiences could now hear the actors speak. Some of these early talkies are downright dreadful while some others are just odd curios. RAIN OR SHINE falls into the category of just plain dreadful.\n\nMost of the blame for this film being so terrible and tough to watch falls on the shoulders of its director, Frank Capra. While Capra did great things for Harry Langdon during the silent era and from the mid-1930s on he made some of the most iconic American films of the era (IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, MEET JOHN DOE and many others), but even great directors have their duds--and this film was definitely a dud.\n\nThe film is nominally about a circus that is chronically on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the entire show was the vaudevillian, Joe Cook. While one of the reviewers thought that Cook was hilarious, he was simply too much--like a giant migraine. He talked and talked and talked and talked. If you liked this sort of in your face routine again and again, then you&apos;d probably like the film. However, I didn&apos;t think he was funny and felt the director should have placed more emphasis on the talented members of the cast. That, or simply punched Cook in the mouth and told him to shut the heck up!! Terrible pacing, annoying dialog and nothing to like--this is truly one of the most painful films I have seen. I only kept watching because I assumed it would get better---it didn&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "Why would Richard Widmark deliberately take his airplane and fly towards an incoming hurricane? Either he was trying to change his image from Kiss of Death and come across as a hero and romantic lead, or he needs the impending danger to reflect on his life choices. If you&apos;re a Widmark fan and would like to see him in a rare non-villainous role, this movie will be pretty entertaining for you. He&apos;ll have to choose between Veronica Lake and Linda Darnell, mend some friendships, and atone for some mistakes that hurt others. He has less than ninety minutes to do all that, so how will screenwriters Richard Murphy and Herman Wouk (who also wrote the original novel) make everything work out? Through flashbacks, of course.\n\nPersonally, the story isn&apos;t my favorite part of the movie. I&apos;m in it for the eye candy. If you&apos;re looking for a better story, check out the same year&apos;s Down to the Sea in Ships. Dick is the second lead in that one, versus the title character in Slattery&apos;s Hurricane, but it will really have an impact on you. This movie is pretty much a romantic drama with a bit of suspense thrown in; after all, he is headed towards a hurricane.\n\nDLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Many of the airplane scenes are filmed with tilted camera angles, bumpy footage, or strobelights from lightening, and that will make you sick. In other words, &quot;Don&apos;t Look, Mom!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this film, I do however doubt that i would have enjoyed it as much if it hadn&apos;t been for the absoloutely storming soundtrack made up of Fifties covers which you believe would have been played by the Beatles at that stage in their careers. Add to that the fact that the Band used to create the sound of the Beatles consisted of some of the leading musicians of the 90&apos;s. They bring their own interpretation to the music just as you believe the Beatles would have done, The only exception to this is the Drum beat which tends to sound more like the 90&apos;s than the 60&apos;s that being said it does make it more accessable to a contemporary audience.\n\nNow as for the actual film itself, It was built on an interesting story about Stuart Sutcliffe, John Lennons best friend, Choosing between music and Art, the latter enevitably wins out with the help of Astrid. Much of the story is of a Tug Of war between John lennon trying to keep him involved in the music and Astrid who sees his artistic potential.  It&apos;s a story that has been played over and over again but is refreshed in the context of surrounding characters that you feel you already know.\n\nThe Characteristically funny Lennon, Business like McCartney, Shy Harrison all come across very comfortably. But they are merely bit characters as this film is more about the choices of sutcliffe than it is about the fab four."

This one is out of print but there are a few VHS still floating around.\n\nThis one has the benefit of a really tight script and excellent cast. Two old time hollywood veterans Van Heflin and Gilbert Roland. And two spaghetti stars Klaus Kinski and George Hilton. All are on top form but its Heflins movie and he turns in a good performance. Direction is assured and inventive. Exceptionally good shoot out in the middle at the mission. Kinski is also effective as a sunglass wearing killer dressed as a preacher, who may have a homosexual relationship with Hilton. It seems hinted at. Watch and decide for Yourself!",

William Shatner and co were so engrained in their respective roles that I didn&apos;t think anyone could fill their exact shoes (even if they were supposed to be their younger selves).\n\nI was wrong.\n\nStar Trek (XI) is undoubtedly the best of the franchise since The Wrath of Khan. If follows the early years of the most famous crew in sci-fi history. Yes, every actor nails his or her character (possibly with the minor exception of Simon Pegg as Scotty, but that&apos;s a minor gripe). Also, this isn&apos;t just &apos;Star Trek The Early Years&apos; - the story cleverly weaves in the old mythology - I won&apos;t say too much on that in case you&apos;re not aware of how it all plays out.\n\nI will say that (if you can forgive JJ Abrams slightly overused &apos;lens flare effects&apos;) it is the most exciting of all the Trek movies. There&apos;s plenty of action and decent special effects. It doesn&apos;t quite rival Star Wars - it seems to be able to maintain its &apos;alternativeness&apos; to the other great sci-fi franchise. It doesn&apos;t just breathe new life into the franchise (Star Trek X was a little disappointing), it makes &apos;Trek&apos; accessible to the masses. If you don&apos;t know your Tribbles from your Borg, it really doesn&apos;t matter - this starts everything again and you don&apos;t need to know the backstory - you only need to be in for a good, popcorn-munching, sci-fi ride.\n\nMay this franchise live long and prosper.",

      "name": "A Historical Event and a One of a Kind Gig Captured for Posterity",
      "reviewBody": "In 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed some of Rock&apos;s greatest bands performed a one of a kind gig to commemorate the historical event. And what a gig it was. With over a million people estimated to be in attendance, the largest in history, the concert lived up to its promise. Thrilling, entertaining and with over an hour of great music, &quot;For Those About to Rock: Monsters in Moscow&quot; documented when history and music converged resulting in one unforgettable triumph of musical artistry and the human spirit. Kicking things off is Pantera hitting their stride as they began their ascent to being Metal Gods with the &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; era as they unleash their headbanging assault never letting up throughout. Local band E.S.T. follows and while predictably no match for their Western counterparts they ably play some fine solid Hard Rock. The organizer fell of the boat when it was decided The Black Crowes were to perform as their Southern-fried boogie is way out of place in the lineup and they sure slowed down the show. Nevertheless the boys were pros as they added a soulful retro slant to the proceedings. Metallica was in the zone as they proved they were the best Metal band of the time with their flawless performances of their classics where power and beauty coalesce in perfection. Capping off the momentuous event is battle-hardened veterans AC/DC where they belt out their high decibel Hard Rock in glorious energy and power with matching inflatable dolls and fireworks to end the historic show in a moving and stirring grand finale. Excellent camera work and good sound add icing to the cake and interspersed with the performances are interviews with the band members and the audience as they react to being a part of one of the most violent and decisive eras in world history. I remember seeing this in VHS back in the day drove me to headbang and scale my room like a lunatic showing the power the music had on my then teenage head. Viewing it now I no longer torture my neck and my room but the sheer dynamism and influence of these powerful songs remain and it brings me back to that great time when life was much better and Rock was everything. One of the best Rock concerts caught on film this is one every Rock fan should view and one that should immediately see a DVD/Blu-ray release. &quot;Metal Up Your A**&quot;!",

His direction is very assured and he succeeds in creating a distinctly French ambiance and period atmosphere strangely lacking from the later version of Chrisian-Jaque. The less said about the Robert Wise version the better! Unlike these two directors Romm has resisted the temptation to combine this story with another of Maupassant&apos;s Franco-Prussian War tales &apos;Mademoiselle Fifi&apos;. The title &apos;Boule de Suif&apos; literally translates as &apos;tub of lard&apos; and refers to the prostitute Elisabeth Rousset marvellously portrayed by Elisabeth Sergeyeva. As anyone who has read this short story will know it reflects human nature in a very negative light. The selfish and self-interested passengers beg Rousset to sleep with the Prussian officer so that he will allow them to resume their interrupted journey. This she does but is subsequently shunned by them and feels the weight of their hypocrisy. Even the nuns show little compassion. Romm has used the cramped conditions of the coach and extensive close ups to great effect in bringing this masterful tale to the screen.",

      "reviewBody": "December 2001. Amidst the noise of the other novel adaptations (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Discovery of Heaven) comes a simple, loveable, heart-warming story of a cat that turned into a young lady.\n\n Based on the famous children&apos;s book by Annie M.G. Schmidt, the movie tells of a young lady Minoes who takes shelter at Tibbe&apos;s house. Tibbe is a shy reporter on the verge of getting fired, because he is too afraid to go up to people to get any news. But Minoes turns out to be a big help. She still speaks with cats and in this way she hears about all the things happening in town. She tells tibbe the news and in return he lets her stay at his room. Things get complicated as Minoes and Tibbe find out about an evil plan of one of the town&apos;s most fore-standing men. But with help of the cats and Tibbe&apos;s neighbour-girl Bibi, they are too good a team to be beaten.\n\nThe story is one thing, but there is more to enjoy. The overall feeling of a small-town community comes through well. The characters are clearly drawn-out, the situations are simple and the world-events are fare away. People care about the fish-car that got crashed and a pot of golden coins found in the cemetary.\n\nIn that environment we get to know Minoes, played by Carice van Houten. She puts the problems and enjoyments of being a young lady with cat-qualities convincingly to the screen. She climbs roofs, is fond of fish and is terrified of even the smallest dog. Throughout the movie she more and more finds a balance between being human and cat at the same time. And that is the most important theme of the movie, being happy with your self and standing up for that. Tibbe, the reporter, has to overcome his shyness to stand up to the evil plans of mr. Ellemeet and convince the townspeople of those evil plans. But fortunately he has Minoes, Bibi and bunch of cats to back him up. Tibbe, played by comedian Theo Maassen, is fun to watch and really makes you feel for his problems.\n\nAnd there is more, like the talking cats that all have different personalities, all the other actors that do great jobs, the typically dutch look and feel of the movie etc. But above all Minoes shows us the heart-warming qualities and timelessness of a well-made, old-fashioned, simple story. Treat yourself and take your kids or somebody elses.",

The plot seems simpler, the idiocy seems to be kept more &apos;in-check&apos; and it just made the film that bit more enjoyable rather than annoying."

There is too much chatting between characters but there was something which made me complete the film in one sitting n although as a horror fan i got cheated into seeing this, i cannot dismiss this as a bad film. This film falls perfectly in the Lovecraftian horror genre. Has elements of science fiction, romance, mythos n fate. The acting by the two leads was surprisingly very good n both the characters were likeable. The only drawback is u dont get to see the monster in its full form but thats not the point of the film. Also noteworthy are some beautifully shot scenes.  The ending scene was beautifully done with beautiful settings. To b honest, i dont like such films n will not watch these kinda films.  One of my online pal convinced me into seeing this. Definitely it is a very good film but not my taste.",

Garcia and Grisman and two cool guys and they tell their story is a nice, causal way.

The hotel scene is this movie is downright scary.\n\nI always look forward for the horror films festival known as 8 Films to Die For.\n\nI first saw this in 2008 on a dvd which I own. Revisited it recently. This film has one of the most nerve shattering, horrific opening. This film gets under your skin. This is not torture porn or Hostel wannabe. The script is solidly scary n really frightening when u come to kno that it is based on a true story of a drug lord/leader of a religious cult that practiced human sacrifices. The tension in this film is very high and the atmosphere is genuinely scary. Direction by Zev Berman is really good. I don&apos;t know y he ain&apos;t doin any more movies. He shud get more movies.\n\nWas surprised to see Sean Astin. Lastly, the film has some really hot chicks n a very sadistic n creepy bald villain. I felt like thrashing him.",

The festival he is promoting is no ordinary carnival, though -- it also features theater and philosophical dissertations (delivered by none other than then king of horror Vincent Price) and a kiddie talent show that motivates part of the plot.  The rest of the plot is motivated by sleazy merchant Dabney Coleman, and his relations to the mother of a girl in the talent show.\n\nThe children in the talent roles are really excellent performers, and this whole production has a quality and a care taken with it that no other post 1966 Elvis movies can boast of.  The title is really a turn off, but this is a movie that not only would have stood on its own without Elvis, but which actually benefits by his performance.  Solid quirky directing in all but the musical numbers, somewhat interesting movie.",

      "name": "Spanish/Mexican co-production of historical interest , being the first Paella Western shot in Spain",
      "reviewBody": "Average adventure Chorizo western with thrills , action, riding pursuits and crossfire . A Spanish pulp adventure series from the 1940s and 1950s, unabashedly inspired by &quot;Zorro by Johnson MacCulley&quot; , it is the basis for this campy film with a black-masked hero called &quot;El Coyote.&quot; The year is 1848 and the United States has just annexed the region of California . This moving Coyote Western contains emotion , gun-play , shimmer locations and being proceeded in American style more than Spaghetti Western . The leading man here is Abel Salazar/El Coyote ; in order to end the abuse of the Yankee authorities on the local population, don César de Echagüe Sr (Rafael Bardem) calls his son, the somewhat ridiculous , and embarrassing César de Echagüe junior (Abel Salazar) , to go back from Spain, where he was studying . Cesar Echague Sr . criticizes his son for being a wimp without knowing that he is secretly the dashing , daring , hot-blooded &quot;El Coyote&quot; . As El Coyote takes up arms a bit later in the century, against ruthless Americans and the nasty Capitán Poch (Santiago Rivero) . Along the way El Coyote falls in love for the beautiful damsel in distress (Gloria Marin) . California joined the United States in 1850 , and the plot&apos;s main villain is an American general who plans to steal haciendas from their rightful Hispanic owners , which include El Coyote&apos;s family. The film&apos;s charm is its attempt to re-create the style of the popular El Coyote pulp series, with grand pronouncements about pure good and pure evil .\n\nThis is an adventure western postboiler with intrigue , double-identity , noisy action, go riding , chases and shootouts . This Iberian western contains a story full of vengeance , adequate but slow dramatic pace and slick direction . This is an early Tortilla western , before Leone&apos;s style , it is an ordinary example of Californian western style , though it is partly Spanish and partly Mexican . The first Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians as well as Spaniards were doing but their product, if you like traditional westerns remains watchable . Interesting screenplay and story by Jose Mallorqui , a notorious writer who wrote the successful ¨El Coyote¨ series . It results to be a trilling as well as action/vengeance Western with lots of shots , fights and duels . The film does not have flashy sword fights like the current &quot;Zorro&quot; movie , but it shows that there is more than one way to tell a good adventure yarn. Being first cinematic appearance of this fictitious , sucessful character written by Jose Mallorqui , whose novels were a big hit in Spain and Latinoamerica . But this mediocre tale particularly fails to ignite enough entertainment and excitement in the part of the spectator . As it is utterly predictable in every aspect as well as the action , and the story nothing special . Abel Salazar as El Coyote gives a passable acting as a an affected and gay dandy , he will immediately provoke the laughter of the rude locals , although appearances are deceiving , and while being well accompanied by a frankly fine support cast . The endearing Spanish/Mexican cast includes the following ones : Rafael Bardem as the big hacienda owner Don César de Echagüe sénior , Manuel Monroy , Santiago Rivero , Carlos Otero , Xan das Bolas , José María Prada , Jose Riesgo , José Calvo , José Marco Davo , Angel Alvarez , Rufino Ingles , Antonio Molino Rojo , Fernando Delgado and many others . It packs an atmospheric and shading cinematography in black and white , plenty of light and dark by Ricardo Torres . And a stirring as well as evocative musical score Odón Alonso . The motion picture written by prolific Jesús Franco , alias Jess Frank , was professional but regularly director by veteran and prestigious filmmaker Joaquin Romero Marchent , getting a limited at the Spanish boxoffice and moderate in Lationoamerica , however it had a second part : La justicia del Coyote (1956) with similar artistic and technician team.\n\nBased on a novel by popular writer Jose Mallorqui, whose novels have been cinematically adapted several times, such as : El Coyote 1954 by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Abel Salazar, Gloria Marin, Manuel Monroy, followed by a sequel La Justicia del Coyote 1954 by Marchent himself and same actors . And The sign of the Coyote 1963 also titled El Vengador de California by Mario Caiano with Fernando Casanova, Mario Feliciani, Maria Luz Galicia and Fernando Sancho. And La vuelta del Coyote (1998) by Mario Camus with José Coronado , Nigel Davenport, Alberto Mendoza, Manuel Alexandre, Ramon Langa, Ray Lovelock, Chiara Caselli , Isabel Serrano, Manuel Zarzo, Txema Blasco . Jose Mallorqui also wrote scripts for Spaghetti or Chorizo Westerns , such as : Brandy by Jose Luis Borau , 3 hombres buenos by Joaquin Marchent , 4 balazos by Agustin Navarro , El sheriff terrible by Antonio Momplet , Winchester uno entre mil by Primo Zeglio and Heroes del oeste by Steno. And in similar style the Spanish heartthrob with international renown : Antonio Banderas, currently starring in &quot;The Mask of Zorro¨, both films are set in 19th-century California, but while Zorro fights Spanish oppression, Coyote faces off the Americans .",

      "reviewBody": "Director Bernardo Bertolucci is the perfect choice for bringing Paul Bowles incredible novel -- one of the most finely crafted of the 20th century and one of my favorite books -- to the screen. Debra Winger and John Malkovich are fine as Kit and Port -- spoiled, bored, EMPTY Americans &apos;travelling&apos; (NOT tourists) in Morocco just after WWII. Their journey -- one of self-discovery and an attempt to bring some life back into their marriage -- turns from one of idle fascination with an exotic culture (one in which Bowles, the author, immersed himself long ago, one which he loved unabashedly) turns into a trip to hell. Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.\n\nCampbell Scott is also good in the role of their friend Tunner, and the Lyles -- the fawning Eric and his intolerably superior mother -- are every bit as disgusting as they seem. Some viewers have found these latter two portrayals to be a bit &apos;over the top&apos; -- but they&apos;re completely irritating characters, whining and complaining constantly about the conditions in which they chose to place themselves. They are the biting fleas you cannot remove from your sleeping bag, no matter how long you search for them.\n\nFilmed on location in the African desert, the film resounds and shines with Bertolucci&apos;s touch -- if it seems long and slow in places, those characteristic accurately portray the atmosphere of life in desert Morocco. The unbelievable heat would tend to slow things down a bit. The director&apos;s use of camera angles, light, and those long, slow, sweeping shots are masterful and perfect. Bowles was consulted every step of the way -- a sign of the respect held for the author and his work by the director -- and he even appears in the film and supplies narration.\n\nA lot of people may find this type of film to be a bore, but you have to be consistent by watching it. If you want to fully understand the movie, you have to read the book, for the film itself, omits a great deal of material that would have the made the film longer than that of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.\n\nI am amazed that a film of this scope, made by a director of Bertolucci&apos;s stature, with two of the most critically acclaimed actors of our time, has not appeared on DVD. There&apos;s a wonderful documentary called DESERT ROSES: THE MAKING OF &apos;THE SHELTERING SKY&apos; that would make a nice piece of bonus material for a DVD release. When the film was shown on BRAVO, that network had the good taste to run the documentary along with it. There&apos;s also a fine documentary on Bowles available from Mystic Fire Video, PAUL BOWLES IN MOROCCO, that gives an informative portrait of this literary giant.\n\n 8/10\n\n1990 140 minutes Rated: R CC."

      "reviewBody": "Taken out of its Nazi Germany context, My Life For Ireland for me is not even good propaganda. It was a story I just could not buy. But during its day playing to an audience of impressionable youth, and that&apos;s who it was aimed at who never got any contrary information, I can see why it had a certain appeal. This film was never shown in Ireland, the products of German cinema in 1941 were not getting off the continent.\n\nMy Life For Ireland was aimed at German youth, Hitler youth about to go to war against the British to show what a rotten nation this was. It begins in 1903 when we see landlords evicting tenants, starvation all around, things that were actually happening over fifty years earlier. Werner Hinz playing Irish patriot Michael O&apos;Brian is captured after a raid where an English sheriff who looked a whole lot like Winston Churchill is shot and killed. Hinz is sentenced to death,but on the day of his execution, he marries his pregnant girlfriend Anna Dammann and she swears to raise an Irish patriot.\n\nFast forward to 1921 and that kid is now young Will Quadflieg and he and other Irish kids are going to an English public school set up in Dublin to train the youth to be good subjects of His Majesty. Quadflieg brings home some his friends and one of them Heinz Ohlssen is really taken with Quadflieg&apos;s mom. So when he sees IRA man Rene Deltgen visiting Damann he misreads things, but still it was only innocently that he betrays Deltgen to a British kid going to his school and acting as an informer.\n\nFor the rest of the film, let&apos;s say the young man gets a big old chance to redeem himself for the cause of Ireland. The title of the film says it all.\n\nThis film was directed by Max W. Kimmich who was Joseph Goebbals brother-in-law so you know that this film had the interest of the highest authorities in Nazi Germany. Marketed to German youth, the message was obvious, the Irish kids fought and beat the British back, you Hitler led German youth can do the same.\n\nPersonally I found the whole puppy love aspect of the plot just a bit ridiculous. I can&apos;t believe that Kimmich who was a writer as well as director of this film could not come up with a better plot device.\n\nOn the plus side Kimmich also must have seen John Ford&apos;s The Informer because My Life For Ireland has that same dark look of intrigue about it and the final scenes of the uprising are well staged. And I learned here that extras were actually killed during those scenes and they were left in the film. Even in Hollywood, that wouldn&apos;t have happened.\n\nSeen today My Life For Ireland is a curiosity and a sad remembrance of kids going off to battle with the message of this film and others ringing in their ears.",

      "reviewBody": "Fifth in the series of Universal Studios&apos; talking mule movies, this entry provides very little that is not predictable since the Francis films, in spite of their scripted absurdity, were calculable successes at the box office and there was scant cause to use innovation. Peter Stirling (Donald O&apos;Connor), is recalled to active Army duty, but when the hapless lieutenant is assigned to a Women&apos;s Army Corps (WAC) detachment due to a flawed clerical procedure in the Pentagon, neither he nor his new distaff officer companions are pleased with a nonsensical situation. His WAC superiors believe that Peter has been planted as a scout and is being used to undermine their efforts opposing a men&apos;s army unit in an upcoming War Games matchup, and Peter and Francis invent a method to persuade the women that he is not there for clandestine purposes. The quaint pair is capable of attempting this because Peter&apos;s proxy specialty is training women soldiers to become camouflage experts and since the Games are going to be focused upon just such activity, the situation is readied for crucial events. The film was completed in Spring of 1954, shot primarily at California&apos;s Fort Ord, with numerous WACS assigned there being employed as extras in a film that pleasingly reflects the result of high-quality production values contributed by the Universal management. Arthur Lubin, director of all six of the O&apos;Connor featured Francis films, offers sluggish pacing with this item, largely due to an overly complicated scenario that weighs down the final section dealing with camouflage competition between the military men and women. As with all Francis pictures, a primary interest in this one relates to early performances of well-known actors, including the initial yelps of fear from &quot;Scream Queen&quot; Allison Hayes, and Universal ingénues Mamie Van Doren and Julia Adams, although the best playing is by veteran ZaSu Pitts as an undone Army nurse; clever thematic scoring by Irving Gertz was used years later by the Studio for other releases.",

      "reviewBody": "Of Paranormal Activity 3, I can tell you this much: Chances are, if the first one didn&apos;t do much for you and you found the second one to be kind of blah and repetitive, there&apos;s no way you&apos;ll like the third one. That&apos;s a fact. The setup and premise are familiar, even if the characters are not. So as such, I can understand someone&apos;s not liking this one much at all. But. I personally found the first and second ones to be pretty scary – even when, in the second one, I knew stuff was going to happen. It has to be a good film when you&apos;re surprised even when you expect something, right? So, right or wrong, I loved this movie. It gave me what I was seeking, and more.\n\nWhereas the second film was set shortly before the first one, this film takes a look at the childhood of Katie, the protagonist of the first film. You may recall that as the first movie progressed, Katie became convinced that something was after her specifically – but she couldn&apos;t imagine why. This movie attempts to resolve that issue. And you sort of have to give credit to a movie that resolves some things while leaving other threads dangling just enough to make one wonder what the hey is going on.\n\nIt&apos;s 1988. Young Katie lives with her younger sister Kristi, her mom Julie, and Julie&apos;s boyfriend Dennis. Strange things are afoot in their house, around the same time that young Kristi begins communicating with an imaginary friend named Toby. Is it a normal kid phase, or is it something more sinister? As with the other films, cameras are placed around the house to capture anything odd that may happen during the night. (In a clever bit of ingenuity, Dennis takes apart an oscillating fan and places a camera on it so that he can pan from living room to kitchen and back.)\n\nWhat makes a movie like this work for me is the same thing that made The Blair Witch Project work (and its sequel not work at all) – it feels voyeuristic, as if we were simply peeking in on some family&apos;s everyday lives. Reasons are given for the constant filming (Dennis tells Kristi, for example, that he&apos;s &quot;testing&quot; his new camera as they have a tea party.) We&apos;re automatically drawn to the video footage. What will we see? We&apos;re now ready for something – will it jump out at us? Will furniture be overturned? Or something even worse?\n\nThe mood is another huge selling point. People react as you&apos;d expect them to. Dennis is obsessed with finding out what&apos;s causing those noises and other disturbances; Julie thinks he&apos;s completely off his rocker and becomes more testy as time goes by. People who also experience the occurrences, like a babysitter and a friend of Dennis, are stunned to the point of not wishing to discuss the matter further, hurriedly leaving as soon as possible.\n\nNow, I can&apos;t say that everyone, even those who love to be scared, is going to love this as much as I did. For me, since we see almost everything through the lens of a camera, the terror – and the anticipation – are grossly heightened. When that door is opened, what will we find? It&apos;s not going to be pretty, but unlike a standard horror film where one can simply slough off a shock as being too fantastic, here we&apos;re so easily drawn in by and engaged with our surrogate family that we feel as terrified and mystified as they do.\n\nParanormal Activity 3 won&apos;t answer everything that the first two may have left unsolved, but it does offer hints as to why, in the present day, these events are still occurring to Katie and her family. We see a part of that genesis, and it&apos;s not really what I expected. I was unsettled and thankful I hadn&apos;t seen the movie at night. Okay, that might be a little hyperbolic, and when some of you actually watch the movie you&apos;ll laugh at me for being skittish. I don&apos;t care. I enjoyed the movie, and that&apos;s all I&apos;m concerned with.",

It looked pretty expensive, and We know how Mexico&apos;s pesos are devaluated currently,the scenaries are beautiful and the movie it reminded me a bit of THX 1138, Equilibrium, Fahrenheit 451 and some others of the kind \n\nlets give it some credit, in its context, usually Mexican films are pretty much the same all the time, I felt this one was significantly different at least from my point of view, the theme was new for Mexican directors, and the story, everything, We know we&apos;ve seen the plot in other international movies already, but at least not in here and trust me I was always complaining about it \n\nthe plot I think it was OK, most of the bad side actors and Pablo (the main one) I felt were good in their roles, but the truth is the good guys (the girl and the priest) were halfway the road, it was like not enough character development, motives, their dialogues lacked of feeling and emotion sometimes, etc I just could not buy them...\n\nall in all I LIKED THE MOVIe, I enjoyed it, was Interesting, visually appealing, I was tense in some scenes waiting for the outcome, and I was surprised for the premise of the movie, besides some actings I did not like the end... other than that It was OK, and decent for a Mexican Movie...I think the director took some risks but if He makes another one maybe he&apos;ll get there...

Sadly, this is no good.\n\nEr, where do I begin? The cheap special effects? The shoddy acting? The wafer-thin characters? The ludicrous plot holes? It&apos;s all there - unfortunately.\n\nBasically, what you have here, is a made-for-TV movie, i.e. wobbly sets, unknown actors and not much more.\n\nBottom line - it&apos;s just short of okay. Some people may like it, but not many. There are so many better alien films out there - like &apos;Alien&apos; for example.\n\nPlus side - the leading lady is cute (that&apos;s probably more a plus point for the guys - I can see too many women swooning over sci-fi stalwart Bruce Boxleighter).\n\nOh, well, never mind.

      "reviewBody": "Encounters at the End of the World is a quirky and interesting film, definitely a departure from your average dry science documentary or eye-candy nature film, though it has elements of both.\n\nIt focuses predominantly on the odd collection of people drawn to live in an Antarctic research station, and to a slightly lesser degree on the oddness of the region itself, and the bizarre bits of scientific trivia that can be found there. Then there the bonus meanderings about the ultimate doom of humanity and whether we originally emerged from the sea onto land to escape the &quot;horror&quot; of marine ecosystems.\n\nMany of its parts are fascinating, but for me, it didn&apos;t quite come together as a whole. It drifted in a lot of different directions, but seemed overall to be lacking in focus a bit. There were also a couple of elements that disturbed me a little - one was the inconsistency of talking about how humanity is destroying itself one moment, and then bashing &quot;tree huggers and whale huggers&quot; the next. I guess it&apos;s OK to notice that we&apos;re damaging the world, but not to try and do something about it? The other was that in some cases he seemed to be going out of his way to depict the people he interviewed in embarrassing ways, with things like leaving the camera lingering on them after the interview appeared to be finished, as they stood nervously, apparently trying to figure out if it was over or not.\n\nBut on the whole I would recommend it -- the flaws are offset by some impressive visuals (especially the underwater footage), dry humour, interesting ideas to ponder, and a really great soundtrack by Henry Kaiser and David Lindley, which work very well with the oddness of the content.",

But I also say: &quot;Either you like this movie or you don&apos;t&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "This is often pointed to cynically by sportswriters and fans as the ultimate ridiculously sugarcoated sports-hero film. Who&apos;s to argue? If you know Babe Ruth and what he was like, you almost have to laugh at some of the stuff in here. That&apos;s not to say Ruth was a bad man, because he wasn&apos;t. He was extremely likable guy whom his teammates all loved, he was fantastic with kids and very, very generous man. But he also had a lot of faults, too, some of which got him in big trouble with his managers and league officials. His health was a problem at times, thanks, in part to his opulent lifestyle. He was a glutton and an adulterer and life wasn&apos;t fun for him as he got unfairly passed over to be a manager, something he desperately sought. Very few if any of these negative qualities are the in the film - just the good &apos;ole boy - the kind William Bendix played on his TV show, &quot;The Life Of Riley.&quot; \n\nAlso unrealistic - and typical of sports movies in the &quot;classic era&quot; - is Bendix trying to throw and hit a baseball. Thank goodness modern-day movies don&apos;t have actors like this who are clueless on how to play the actual sport they are portraying.\n\nYet, as sweet and unrealistic as this film can be, it&apos;s a lot better than doing the reverse, which is what Hollywood did in 1992. Too bad you usually get two extremes when it comes biographies made in Hollywood. In the &quot;classic era&quot; films, our heroes could do no wrong. Since the &apos;60s, our heroes are shown to be blemished more than anything else. Where is the middle ground.\n\nThe solution, obviously, is to be &quot;fair and balanced,&quot; but don&apos;t look for that in most biographies made into movies, especially dealing with sports heroes.",

      "reviewBody": "There were very few commercial feature films made during the Italian fascist era that were as openly propagandistic as this famous (notorious?) dramatic paean to the Blackshirts. The story takes place in a small village in Italy in October of 1922, on the eve of the fascist &quot;March on Rome&quot;, in which King Victor Emanuel III was persuaded to consign power to Benito Mussolini. Gianfranco Giachetti is Dr. Cardini, a doctor at the local psychiatric hospital, where a strike has been called by the local socialists. Cardini turns to the fascists to help avert the strike. His son Roberto (Mino Doro) rounds up fascist friends to fight those aligned with the strikers and the town&apos;s socialists. Mario, Roberto&apos;s kid brother (winningly portrayed by Franco Brambilla), wears the fascist armband that reads &quot;me ne frego&quot; (&quot;To hell with it&quot;---a motto of the fascist  squadristi.) &quot;They are not naughty words,&quot; he tells his little sister, &quot;they just show that we fascists have no fear of anything.&quot; Brawls break out between the fascists and the strikers and they are given the &quot;castor oil&quot; treatment (remember the father in Fellini&apos;s AMARCORD?) and forced to return to work. More confrontations occur between the fascists and the &quot;socialist subversives&quot;, who are of course seen as a threat to the Italian social order in this village, a microcosmic emblem of the nation. More battles ensue and in one of them little Mario is shot down. News of the boy&apos;s death strengthens the fascists&apos; resolve to join in the movement to form a new Italian government. The journey will rescue the nation from the clutches of subversion, socialism, communism. Dr. Cardini goes with them. &quot;Today, nobody can stay at home! Mario is with us!&quot; On a very simplistic, elemental level the film succeeds in rousing passions, exactly its intention. On any intellectual or moral level, there is a great deal to question here, of course, especially in hindsight. Simply as a film, it is extremely interesting and directed effectively by the great Alessandro Blasetti, who gave us terrific films like THE IRON CROWN, PRIMA COMUNIONE and FABIOLA. In 1937 it played New York City at the Broadway Cine&apos; Roma, an Italian-language house, under the title PICCOLO EROE or &quot;LITTLE HERO&quot;, at a time when many Italian-Americans or Italians living in America indeed supported Mussolini as a savior of the Italian nation."

One watches a film like this to enjoy the old stars in action, including Lionel Barrymore, hamming it up sans wheelchair. Though Garbo has never been one of my favorites I enjoyed her performance here; she smiled quite a bit and never once said she wanted to be alone. Most of the time she just wanted to be with handsome Ramon Novarro, and who could blame her? \n\nFunniest moment to me: Ramon&apos;s character is obviously Catholic (as Ramon was in real life) and he has promised his mother to keep a candle lit before this Madonna icon and never let the flame go out, because if it goes out then evil will descend upon him. So Mata (Greta) tells Alexi (Ramon) that his room is too brightly lit; he goes around and turns off all the lights -- except for the candle. So then she asks him to blow out the candle. &quot;If I am everything to you then you will blow it out.&quot; He asks her in shock: &quot;But why would you ask me to?&quot; (a perfectly reasonable question she doesn&apos;t answer). He ends up rejecting the sacred for the profane, blowing the flame out and the room goes into darkness. The camera pulls away and we are supposed to know instinctively that they are making love all through the night. And of course evil descends on Ramon&apos;s character, and he goes blind, but what the heck, this is Hollywood.\n\nWatch it for the stars, not for history. If you want history, read a book.",

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;re wrinkly, have health issues and your age is higher than the calibre of your gun. So what&apos;s a senior to do? Why get a bigger gun of course. That is certainly one of many philosophies in the action comedy RED (That would be Retired Extremely Dangerous for those still living in fear of Communism. Hey, it is the right age bracket) which collects a who&apos;s who of Oscar-grade talent and has them blow stuff up real good. This is but the fourth men-on-a-mission film so far this year after The Expendables, The A-Team and The Losers, heck even Inception could fall into that group. The good news is with the exception of the latter it is the best of the bunch and by far the most fun you&apos;re bound to have this fall season. \n\nNow onto the CIA. I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re dipping their dirty little fingers into Stateside but in addition to being at the center of some ticked off senior&apos;s attention in RED, they have been the villains in aforementioned The Losers and The A-Team as well as Salt and Knight &amp; Day. Talk about your need for homeland security, they had better keep one of those high-tech satellites over Hollywood. At the receiving end of the Central Intelligence Agency&apos;s scope are a band of former operatives including the &quot;kid&quot; of the group, Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), the ailing Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), the brain-fried eccentric, Marvin Boggs (John Malcovich) and the sultry heartbreaker, Victoria (Helen Mirren). Brian Cox also shows up as a Ruskie who may or may not have been previously shot by one of the former. Though not having seen action in a good decade, they have been deemed &quot;RED&quot; by an unknown force, which means curtains for this rag-tag bunch of geriatrics. \n\nThe cast truly is great in RED, and I don&apos;t simply mean the actors in general; they simply all give full-on great, funny performances. The subtle (but hilarious) underlying lament of these characters is they all reminisce over their past lives as hardened assassins and pine just to kill one more little ol&apos; person. More at the forefront of course is the bang-on wry humour and delicious action sequences. This is old fashion stunt work at play here (fittingly perhaps) and I&apos;ll take it over a green screen any day. These bursts of adrenaline are dumb to be sure, but not totally ludicrous; think of a cross between Die Hard and Enemy of the State. What they are not is anything short of exciting and kinetic, and are interspersed with laughs in such a way as to not drift to one focus too long. RED also gleefully embraces its comic book origins, using playful transitions as the globe-trotting commences. Yet again, director Robert Schwentke never revels in one gimmick for too long and the film goes down smooth and easy as a result.\n\nThe younger cast is more than worth mentioning as well, with the highest accolades going to Mary-Louis Parker from TV&apos;s Weeds. There is a joke in RED which I am not sure was intentioned, when after being injected with a knockout-drug, Parker&apos;s Sarah exclaims &quot;I&apos;m so high&quot;. She steals most scenes when given the chance but her character (a love interest of Frank who unintentionally gets caught up in the fracas) is utilized far more towards the beginning of the film. Karl Urban is also solid as a CIA operative tasked in finding the RED&apos;s but becomes suspicious at his orders which grow increasingly corrupt. I always wonder in the movie world how they would explain attack helicopters shredding an airport to the general public. The government must have some amazing PR agents on staff. Richard Dreyfus (in his second cameo of the year after Piranha) is also well used as an oily arms dealer who comes across the team&apos;s path.\n\nSummit Entertainment is pulling out all the marketing stops for this film, and I am happy to report the results seem to be worth the glamour. While venturing through my theatres ticket checkpoint they stamped my stub &quot;confidential&quot; instead of ripping it, and a squad of agents clad in sunglasses and suits patrolled the lobby. The showing seemed to be a generous mix of old and new patrons and that really comes as no surprise. Even though the majority of the cast has long breached 60, these are actors generations of all ages still admire. Even if they are not the draws they once were (some of them never were) this is a great example of people showing up to see actors, performers, and not special effects. RED may be imperfect, it may not even be particularly fresh, but it exudes something movies lack far too often: fun.\n\nplayeraffinity.com",

      "reviewBody": "In only his second leading role, Brandon Lee already shows charisma and even a gift for self-parody, and he particularly shines when he&apos;s allowed to show his terrific fighting skills....unfortunately there is much more gun action than hand-to-hand combat here. His co-star, Debi Monahan, is not much of a fighter, but she&apos;s sexy, she can handle a gun and if there was a &quot;best cleavage&quot; award in the movies then I think she would have won it that year. Watching these two almost makes up for the forced &quot;comic relief&quot; from the secondary characters, the monotonous action, the confusing geography and the low production values. But who thought it was a good idea to have Ernest Borgnine waving a shotgun and running around in the desert at his age? (Happy belated 89th birthday, by the way!) (**)",

I guess there is some environmental activist named santos that meets and unfortunate end, and they are sort of involved. The plot of this movie is so really hard to follow. Maybe because there really is not much of a plot at all. The last 15min are sort of exciting, only because you know it&apos;s almost over so you can do something else.\n\nYes, Sandra has a love scene. No it&apos;s exciting enough to watch this movie.\n\nEver watched a movie that made you keep looking at the VCR to see how long you had been watching it?

      "reviewBody": "What should have been a much more effective film with an absorbing, sometimes gripping story, is somehow turned into a tepid melodrama interesting only for the performances of the principal players--Burt Lancaster, Joan Fontaine and Robert Newton. \n\nBasically, the story has hot tempered Lancaster running from the law and seeking shelter in Fontaine&apos;s apartment. Against her better judgment, she becomes involved with him but can&apos;t protect him from a blackmailer (Robert Newton) who has witnessed Lancaster&apos;s crime. Joan Fontaine gives a surprisingly strong performance in a confrontation scene with Newton that is the most gripping moment of the film. To tell any more would be to give the rest of the plot away.\n\nAs intense as Lancaster is, it&apos;s not a very well written role--there is definitely something lacking in the screenplay. Nor is the chemistry between him and Fontaine very strong or believable. She gives one of her better performances as the woman who just happens to cross paths with a killer.\n\nThe low key lighting gives the film a grim, film noir look that is appropriate for this kind of story, as does Miklos Rozsa&apos;s score although it does not rank with some of his best work. At best, it&apos;s a routine melodrama that could have been so much more."

      "reviewBody": "Most of this film is shot directly from the point of view of the narrator, an unseen videographer who travels the titular river recording the myriad stories played out on its banks and vessels. Even the scenes in which he is not involved could well be his thoughts of events as he recounts what he has been told by others and it is this that is initially the most striking element of Suzhou River. It makes the viewer feel much more involved in the unfolding tale, although at times the rapid cuts and shaky camera are unnecessarily disorientating.\n\nThe narrator begins to tell us about his life - his job, his girlfriend Meimei who he obsessively videos and his fascination with the people of Suzhou River. But then this takes a back seat to his recounting of one of the many tales infamous within the community, of Mardar the motorcycle courier who is relentlessly searching the city for his lost love, Mudan. Her body was never found after she threw herself into the river from a bridge when Mardar was forced into kidnapping her by his gangland boss. But then this tragic story collides with our own narrator&apos;s as Mardar is convinced that he has finally found his long lost love and that she is Meimei. Obvious comparisons have been drawn to Vertigo&apos;s plot of a man undone by his lover&apos;s suicide and determined that he has found her again.\n\nThis debut feature from Chinese director Lou Ye benefits greatly from his unconventional style which seems to make the events more tangible. He portrays the river itself as a metaphor for life, its swirling eddies and undercurrents the many stories it keeps within its deep mysterious heart, with no effect on the mass flow of life, but turning the individual lives of those involved upside down. The parts of the film dealing with the burgeoning affections of Mardar and Mudan are excellent (particularly for Zhou Xin, who plays both of the two vastly different lead female roles equally well) , however I felt the events gathered pace a little too quickly towards the end, rushing the story of the narrator and Meimei in comparison to that of Mardar and Mudan. The result of this was an ending which seemed a tad abrupt and so the empathy for the narrator was not as heightened as it might have been, even with the great device of us seeing everything through his eyes. Despite this Suzhou River is a stylishly original tale who&apos;s depth and undercurrents make it stand out from the majority of the flotsam and jetsam our video stores carry."

I will simply try to find and watch more film of his. His comments and quotes here in IMDb are impressive as well. \n\nOn to the film: Shot in Rome, it will thrill people with interest on architecture both visually, but thematically as well, well at least at some points. The musical score is stunning. It suits the theme and climax that Greenaway masterfully builds. As with The Cook the Thief His Wife &amp; Her Lover, it is not various separate songs. All the soundtrack songs together form a thriumph of visual and audio art, suggesting my point about the importance of film soundtracks for an effective impact on viewer. This is a sad story, but it features some light points where joy and lust for life is celebrated - at least for my eyes and ears.\n\nThose who criticise Greenaway for attempting only to shock the viewers have simply lost the point. Anyway. The Belly of an architect is no violent film, so it is highly recommended to those interested in films, maybe a bit &apos;arty&apos;, but with heart ."

Even so, it&apos;s just plain fun as Lon Chaney knocks off the traitors who sent him to death with their treachery. The L.A. locations are terrific, and the Dragnet-style narration adds spice to the proceedings. It&apos;s speedy and nostalgic, very much a &quot;fifties&quot; film.\n\nAs for the Roan DVD, I&apos;m sorry to say that it has not been restored and is a disappointment. I have had much trouble acquiring the &quot;perfect&quot; version of this film, even though I&apos;ve had it on VHS from FOUR(!) different companies, as well as on TNT. Some day I hope this personal fave of mine will get a clean and proper transfer on disc."

      "reviewBody": "Once more in the &apos;Golden Age&apos; of Hollywood a major studio, Paramount, ventures forth into the South Seas. These films follow pretty much the same formula. A exotic tropical island, the adversary, in this case Pirates, romance and finally the concluding disaster. Where the attractive couple always survive and true love is fulfilled.\n\nTYPHOON (1940) follows this formula with a few interesting variations. Pearls are the objective and to help get them Skipper Joe (Lynne Overman) has a pre-WWI Submarine at his disposal. He is assisted by shanghaied Johnny Potter (Robert Preston). They are pursued by Pirate Kehi (Chief Thundercloud) and threatened by mutinous Mekaike (J. Carroll Naish). Who manages to lose the Submarine, forgetting that you have to close the hatches before diving the boat.\n\nAll is not lost though, on their island is Dea (Dorothy Lamour) back in the Sarong again! Rehabilitating the perpetual drunk Johnny with the help of her Chimpanse companion and finding romance. The Pirates make a reappearance, but fortunately are dispatched by the TYPHOON arriving in the nick of time to wrap up the film. In a brisk seventy (70) minutes.\n\nLamour had first donned the Sarong in THE HURRICANE (1937) the best of these epics, Directed by John Ford. Lamour is always good to look at even in material like this. She was capable of more as in JOHNNY APOLLO (1940) and looked just as good in contemporary fashions. Filmed in TechniColor the ending disaster benefited from Paramounts SFX Wizard Gordon Jennings. Though lasting only about five (5) minutes it is impressive, though not the equal of THE HURRICANE. This is a light entertainment and should be enjoyed as such.",

This is the first movie that Hopper has both played a hippy that isn&apos;t stoned on and off the screen. I really liked this movie. It&apos;s not for everyone, but for those of us who don&apos;t mind a comedy with dirty cops, foul mouthed aging hippies, a surly fed with a secret, and a whole lot of plot twists, than this is the movie for you. Also, Carol Kane was hilarious as Buckner&apos;s aunt. 10/10"

      "reviewBody": "This is probably the most expurgated version of Fanny Hill you&apos;ll ever see. The only way to get an R rating in 1964 for a movie with a sexual subject seems to be to turn it into a leering, puerile comedy.  The problem is that it doesn&apos;t work as a comedy, or as erotica, or even as historic fiction.\n\nThe plot revolves around Fanny&apos;s belief that she has been taken in by a kind lady to work in a hat shop, instead of in an expensive brothel.  Fanny manages to avoid the clients she&apos;s been set up with for the entire movie without ever finding out the truth.    The plot never evolves beyond this obvious story.  There&apos;s also no attention paid to accuracy: the setting for the movie lurches around between 1750 and 1890, and the dialogue ranges even further.\n\nOf all the actors in the movie, only Leticia Roman and Miriam Hopkins show any life.  The others are stick figures, feigning animation with affected voices and arched eyebrows.  Not that Roman and Hopkins aren&apos;t guilty of overacting: they just occasionally show there might be more there.\n\nThis movie may be worth preserving along with &quot;Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice&quot; for anthropological studies on 1960&apos;s Hollywood attitudes towards sex, but it&apos;s not worth watching for entertainment.

The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen&apos;s android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren&apos;t dumb the story wouldn&apos;t work.\n\nThe only part of the film that doesn&apos;t really work is the bit in the middle with Laurence Fishburne. I could see three reasons why his character was needed, but it all felt very contrived. He has one important line though, so I can forgive it (just about). I just wish the writers had thought about that part a bit more, as the rest of the film was really great. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen were brilliant too.\n\nPassengers is clever, thoughtful, science fiction, and I would highly recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Five masters of French cinema, namely René Clément, Jean Cocteau, Jean Delannoy, Julien Duvivier and Christian-Jaque, each gave the world a classic in 1946. Of these it is the one directed by Christian-Jaque that seems destined to be overlooked. Even in the context of his total output it is cruelly underrated.\n\nSome have suggested that it is too clever for its own good but that is a moot point.\n\nIt is a beautifully crafted piece of cinema and the last thirty minutes or so represents film at its best. Arthur Honegger&apos;s haunting score and the atmospheric cinematography of Louis Page add to the film&apos;s effectiveness.\n\nIt is essentially a tale of retribution in which ballet producer Sauvage, played by Louis Jouvet, returns to Lyons in order to exact revenge on those who tried to kill him twenty years ago. His targets are rapacious businessman Jerome Nisard and his wife Genevieve. He dupes Genevieve who left him for Jerome and is trapped in an arid, loveless marriage, into believing that he still loves her. Jerome happens to be in hot water financially and is trying to arrange for his idealistic son Francois to marry the daughter of wealthy, influential parents. Sauvage sabotages this scheme by engineering a meeting between Francois and his prima ballerina, the tantalising Ludmilla Tcherina, knowing that she will probably hang him out to dry which she proceeds to do.\n\nGood writing makes good actors even better and the cast has the advantage of brilliant, trenchant dialogue by Henri Jeanson. Jouvet is an actor touched by genius and along with his trademark air of mystery he subtly shows us the pain that motivates his actions. Francois Périer in his breakthrough role as the young Nisard captures brilliantly the emotional torment of one who loves not wisely but too well. The most touching scene is that in which the Genevieve of splendid actress Gaby Morlay is left standing on the platform watching Sauvage&apos;s train pull away knowing that with it goes her last chance of escaping her dreary existence. Jean Brochard is immaculate as Jerome and as Gonin his business colleague, Louis Seigner is always good value. One cannot fail to mention doyenne Marguerite Moreno, as imperious as ever as Francois&apos; wily old aunt.\n\nTrue cinephiles will always appreciate this film&apos;s qualities but one is mystified by its general neglect. Perhaps it is just too cynical and bleak in its portrayal of human nature. Interestingly enough it also questions whether revenge, although a natural instinct, is ever really justified or indeed gives satisfaction. As Robert Louis Stevenson observed: &quot;Sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Encino Man is a comedy influenced by the wackiness of the grunge generation. The young cast, which stars Astin, Shore, and Fraser, is likely to be a major draw for teenagers and younger viewers, who will likely enjoy this movie. \n\nThe story is pretty goofy. Dave (Sean Astin) has major plans for putting a swimming pool in his backyard to at least get some popularity points with the neighborhood teens who could lounge by the water in the blazing California summer sun. But, when he&apos;s breaking ground, he digs up a block of ice with a casualty of the Ice Ages, primitive fellow who he and his hip buddy, Stoney (Pauley Shore), clean off and try to disguise him as a regular American teenager. Needless to say, a lot of mishaps arise out of this. But eventually, the grizzly Link (Fraser), is a pretty popular kid at the high school, and one that Dave thinks will help him get popular, too, in that popularity-by-association kind of way. \n\nMatt Wilson, a jerky jock (Michael DeLuise) interferes with Dave&apos;s plans to just try and pass off Link as a normal exchange student. Already p***ed with Dave and Stoney for getting friendly with his girlfriend Robyn (Megan Ward), and with their increasing popularity--especially Link, who Robyn has a little crush on. Matt figures out Link&apos;s real identity, and it&apos;s a question of whether anyone will believe his story that Link is really from the Ice Ages. Not even the school&apos;s most popular jerk can get off easy with a line like that.\n\nThe cast and this silly story make it an enjoyable comedy. Teens are likely to enjoy Pauley Shore&apos;s scenes as the happy-go-lucky hippie throwback friend, Stoney, as he just seems like such a nice, giant goofball who can really have fun with this material. It&apos;s also pretty funny to watch a fellow from the Ice Age trying to adapt to modern teenage life, much like the historical dudes did in Bill &amp; Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure. It&apos;s even got some sweet tunes on the soundtrack. So loosen up and enjoy it already.",

      "reviewBody": "Adventures , action , crossfire and gorgeous Yugoslavian exteriors magnificently photographed and in which takes place the first emotive meeting between and Winnetou and Old Shatterhand . This is a thrilling and stirring adventure based on Karl May novel with two agreeable characters as Old Shatterhand and Winnetou , being stunningly played by Lex Barker as measurement expert and Pierre Brice as Apache chief&apos;s son respectively . It deals with Old Shatterhand , a railway engineer who arrives at a western little town . The building of the Great Western Railroad trespasses Indian territory and it creates strong facing between the railway company and neighboring Apache tribes . When violent conflict breaks out between greedy railroaders and a tribe of Mescalero Apaches , only two men, destined to be blood brothers, can prevent all-out war : chief&apos;s son Winnetou (Pierre Brice) and German engineer Old Shatterhand (Lex Barker) . Evil Frederick (Mario Adorf) influences the construction supervisor to re-rout the schemed railroad straight ahead Apache land , breaking the peace treatise . Old Shatterhand , who works as a railway engineer and wagon conductor , aware the scheme and attempts to contact with the Apaches in an effort to avoid war . The desperado outlaws attack the little town but they are surrounded by the good guys (Lex Baker , Chris Howland , Walter Barnes) at the saloon where takes place brawls and shootouts . Later on , Apaches also attack and Winnetou struggles Shatterhand being wounded in neck . In spite of troubles caused by bandits led by Frederick (Mario Adorf who played several Spaghetti Western) being supported by Kiowas who prove to be a dangerous enemy , Winnitou is abducted by the baddies but Old Shatterhand set out on pursuit of the bandits and prepares them a trap and the Apache is freed and they get escape . Then nasty band led by Santer sets his eyes on a gold mine placed on holy Indian land . Meanwhile , Old Shatterland falls in love with the Indian girl named Nscho Tschi (Marie Versini subsequently replaced by Karin Dor who married to director Harald Reinl) , Winnitou&apos;s sister , in an enjoyable love story . At the end takes place a moving epilogue by shooting and fighting with no much sense . In successive episodes Old Shatterland and his faithful half-brother Winnetou are ready on the trail to undertake new and risked adventures .\n\nThis is an acceptable first episode about one of the series of popular German made Western , featuring the intimate duo formed by valiant ¨Old Shatterhand¨ who agrees to guide the revolt against outlaws located at Indian territory and immortal ¨Winnetou¨ , both of them will repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular train crash in the saloon , the impressive Indian attack over town and breathtaking chase on canoe in which Shatterhand being pursued by Indians . This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures , shootouts , action , emotion , larger-than-life characters and spectacular scenarios shot in Ivanica, Dubrovnik, Croatia ,Popovo Polje, Roski falls, Yugoslavia ,Zrmanja canyon, Croatia and Zubci, Trebinje, Yugoslavia . Winnetou-Pierre Brice plays , as usual , his excellent and unforgettable role to be continued in a TV series . Lex Barker scores especially high marks , though he plays as a serious and intelligent engineer who joins forces with Winnetou . Enjoyable relationship between Old Shatterhand and Winnetou is quite match . The highbrow Lex Barker played the most part of series : ¨Apache gold (1963)¨ by Harald Reinl , ¨Apaches last Battle (1964)¨ by Hugo Fregonese, ¨Last of renegades(1964)¨, ¨The desperate trail¨, ¨Old Surehand¨ (1965) directed by Alfred Vohrer, ¨Old Shatterland(1966)¨ by Harald Philipp , ¨In the valley of death (1968)¨ by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger as ¨Surehand¨ took the role in two occasions , he starred a diverse character but is pretty similar to Old Shatterland , he plays with mirth and sympathetic manner as ¨Among vultures¨ and ¨Winnetou and Surehand¨ . Besides , Rod Cameron starred only one : ¨Old Firehand¨ in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching as well as sensitive musical score by Martin Bottcher , series&apos; ordinary , being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Rialto Productions was professionally directed by Harald Reinl who directed various Karl May titles , besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi - Edward Wallace adaptation- and realized another Western titled ¨The last Mohican¨ . Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous scenarios and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia including rousing falls , canyon, rivers and mountains ; all of them as spectacular as Almeria- Spain- outdoors where at the same time were shot numerous European Western .",

      "reviewBody": "This film&apos;s silly English title does not serve its material. Indeed, the original Italian title, which was probably a good marketing trick for the time, is also seriously misplaced. A better title would be Foreign Illusions, or just plain Illusions.\n\nSure, the story plays with the idea of sex, but Sordi is rather wistful, almost pathetic, in his loneliness and search for a connection. There is comedy but it&apos;s restrained and wrought with middle-aged perspectives, not bed-hopping and giggling.\n\nSordi is always good and here shows his acting nuances and ability to extract some comic moments, rather ironically, from his failed foreign adventures. Don Giovanni, he is not. The script is solid and explores all the characters with warmth and humanity.\n\nA real feature is the photography, and the snowy landscapes look excellent in monochrome. In a way the frigid landscapes stand as a metaphor for Sordi&apos;s travails.\n\nLanguage presents another barrier, and while Sordi&apos;s English is a lingua franca with the Swedish women, it hardly allows for more intimate communication.\n\nOverall, well worth catching up with this part of the Alberto Sordi catalog.",

Michel Serrault the great actor and has so many different films like with The Inquisitor (1981) with Lino Ventura, La Cage Aux Folles (1978) and even Les Diaboliques (1955). The very good Charles Aznavour is under played as the Armenian tailor with little money but looks as if he knows what is going on as we are also eventually.

      "reviewBody": "Of course there would be no chance of casting the 1941 Technicolor musical remake of the wonderful and incredibly moving 1932 fillm, with Norma Shearer, Fredric March and Leslie Howard, aside. Have always absolutely loved Technicolor and have been blown away by it numerous times, and also musicals (or more in this case play/film with music). Have liked what has been seen of Frank Borzage&apos;s films, quite a fair bit more to see, and do like Jeanette MacDonald and have never minded at all her voice. Can take or leave Gene Raymond.\n\nWhen inevitably comparing which is the better film of the 1932 and 1941 versions, there is no doubt at all in my mind which is the better of the two. Being someone who loves the former and is rather conflicted on the latter. By all means this version of &apos;Smilin Through&apos; is worth a curiosity look and it is not that impossible to sit through. Everybody involved has done much better work, with it being one of not many near-misfires from Borzage.\n\n1941&apos;s &apos;Smilin Through&apos; has advantages. It is very handsomely produced and perhaps more lavish than the 1932 film, the Technicolor truly opulent and blazing quite thrillingly. The music is both beautiful and rousing, not to mention catchy. Several songs populate the film and although momentum dips a bit when they feature, they are great songs and suit MacDonald&apos;s voice very well. &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; is quite spirit-rousing and affecting.\n\nMacDonald, at her loveliest, also comes off well dramatically, the role(s) does stretch her and it is quite different and more complex to her usual roles but she brings charm and pathos. Aherne is sympathetic and is a lovely match for her. Parts do bring a lump to the throat, especially the church death scene.\n\nRaymond however is a disastrous miscast, there is nothing appealing about him whatsoever and he is almost too caddish/smarmy. He also, as some have already said, has no chemistry with MacDonald, that he and she were actually married in real life yet her and Aherne&apos;s chemistry was a million times more believable is a worrying sign. Nelson Eddy would have been a much better choice. Borzage seemed neither interested or comfortable in his direction.\n\nJust felt that way because the pace can be quite stodgy, and although it is already a complicated story it was handled far more cohesively before whereas it was near-convoluted here. It is far too melodramatic and the treacle and schmaltz, both of which the 1932 film did not do, becomes too hard to take due to the amount of them being excessive.\n\nIn summation, not a bad film but left me very conflicted. 5/10",

The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.\n\nThis was the most I&apos;d laughed at one of Woody&apos;s comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I&apos;ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her &quot;sexy&quot; image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.\n\nThis may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than &quot;Devil Wears Prada&quot; and more interesting than &quot;Superman&quot; a great comedy to go see with friends.",

Some stay in Rome and play in the fountains, or go out for coffee, or work, or rob stock yards.\n\nIt&apos;s Luciano Emmer&apos;s first story feature. He had been making documentaries since 1941, and would continue to do so through his death in 2009 at the age of 91, and he hasn&apos;t strayed far from his roots here, with little snippets of minor stories, all important to the characters, but completely unremarkable to outsiders. A widower tries to start a serious relationship with another woman, but that means his daughter must go to camp; a policeman (Marcello Mastroianni in his first substantial role, though his voice is dubbed by Alberto Sordi) has gotten his girlfriend pregnant. They want to marry, but her employers have given her notice; a boy and a girl rent a pedal raft at the beach, sink it, and have to hike back miles.\n\nGiven the title, one immediately thinks of MENScHEN AM SONNTAG, and there&apos;s almost certainly a linkage, but to me it&apos;s simply a handsome little anthology of a world getting back to order after the chaos of the Depression and the Second World War.",

      "reviewBody": "The Gauntlet is a story is pure courage shown on behalf of Clint Eastwood. Also,his directing talents have not gone astray. The film centers around a police detective named Ben Shockeley,who is transferring a prisoner who was with the Mafia. However,the police know of the close bond he has with the prisoner and send out a bunch of their forces to stop him. Shockley eventually crosses paths with renegade bikers,police crooks,and more,with the story eventually finding him driving an armored bus through town to City Hall with millions of police shooting at the bus. I think Clint did a great job in hiring Annie Pearl Curtis as the stunt driver for the bus.She did all the steering and driving through the streets. She&apos;s currently a bus driver in Alachua County,FL. Bus 2306,of course. Unfortunalty,this movie was her first and last performance. She&apos;s now taking it easy and doing her duty. Overall,the action is great and the movie is worth seeing."

The movie later ends in a fun way that suits very well with a popular christmas song for childrens (in Norway) that will be played when the staff credits comes right after the end of the movie.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

      "reviewBody": "To me, &quot;Looking for Richard&quot; is about one man&apos;s love of Shakespearean plays. This film is his vehicle to share that admiration with as many people as possible.  I&apos;m glad Mr. Pacino made this film, because he is so well-respected by such a wide variety of people, that his presence will draw them first to this film and then hopefully to the theatre.\n\nI found the film extremely interesting. If you&apos;re at all interested in theatre, you&apos;ll enjoy watching the cast debate during rehearsals.  It gave me a greater insight into what&apos;s involved in actually putting on a play. Usually, you just see the finished product, and they make it look so easy. I was relieved to learn from the film that the actors and directors struggle with the text of the plays too.  So you don&apos;t have to feel bad if you don&apos;t understand all the dialogue - you will get the gist of it. The film is simply urging people to give Shakespeare another chance.  You might like it, or you might not, but at least you&apos;ll have given it a shot.  And if you do like it, it&apos;ll keep you busy for years.\n\nSince most people are initially exposed to Shakespeare in high school, I imagine that&apos;s where their phobia originates. I had an English teacher who was passionate about Shakespeare, and he instilled that appreciation in me. Unfortunately, everyone isn&apos;t as lucky. Boring classes turned them off, and that&apos;s all they&apos;ll ever experience of Shakespeare. They are missing so much. I hope all the English teachers out there who are less than comfortable with teaching Shakespeare will show this film to their classes to counteract any Shakespeare phobia-inducing incidents.",

We live in Atlanta... dolphins are hard to find...&quot; When single Mitch (Reynolds) and married with children Dave (Bateman) go out they begin talking about each others lives. Both feel like the other one has a better life, then they take a pee. When they wake up the fun begins. Going in I was hoping for a few laughs, mainly because I think the two actors are hilarious. The first half hour was hard to watch, because I was laughing so hard my side hurt and I was crying. Not since &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; was I blown away by the comedy that I was not expecting. By that I mean not only the extreme shocking moments, but the timing between the two and the dialog was so funny that I haven&apos;t had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that it started off on a full run but turned a little more sappy at the end. On the flip side, that part balanced out the rest of it just enough to give your cheeks and side a break. This is a definite R rated comedy that men and women will both love. That is hard to do. I loved it a lot. Overall, next to &quot;Hall Pass&quot; the funniest movie I have seen since &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;. This movie will not disappoint. I give it an A.\n\nWould I watch again? - Absolutely. I want to buy this.\n\n*Also try - Hall Pass &amp; Wedding Crashers"

I was entranced by the story from the very outset. I empathised with the characters to the point of actual heartbreak. This is a film of such honesty; tackling a topic that is still a taboo in today&apos;s &quot;liberal&quot; society. How many movies have you seen that portray gay love in a sensitive, non-judgmental fashion? There are several moments when, even if you find it difficult to deal with the physical depiction of homosexual love (even though it&apos;s not at all graphic), viewers who value love won&apos;t be able to prevent themselves from empathising with the characters - Ennis&apos; reaction when he has to leave Jack for the first time and when, during their argument at their last meeting, Ennis says something that is heartbreaking in its poignancy.\n\nThese lovers - the open-hearted Jack and the silent, suffering Ennis - shared one perfect summer and much of the rest of their lives is a cruel compromise - simply because the world won&apos;t allow their love.\n\nLike all truly good movies, Brokeback Mountain stays with you long after the last image fades from the screen. It makes you question your preconceptions and hopefully makes you want to make the world a place where all people are free to love whom they want as they please."

      "reviewBody": "The Hong Kong filmmakers does it again with another hair-raising horror movie, where three stories are loosely connected together, and all the events take place at an office building.\n\nIn the first story, investor firm employee Pat (Karen Mok) has been reassigned the night-shift at work and encounters some skin-crawling paranormal activities coming from the copy room and the bathroom. This will surely give you some fright, making you wonder what out-of-this-world events might occur at the office late at night.\n\nIn the second story, greedy executive Richard Lee (Jordan Chan) forces veteran employee Mary Ho (Lan Law) into retirement. When a group of co-workers went out to celebrate Mary&apos;s last day with the office, a car accident claims their lives. Afterward, their ghosts return to the office to do some unfinished business. This story will probably make you get angry at office politics, as you are asked to sympathize with the workers. Another freaky story done with a good moral message attached to it.\n\nIn the third story, computer game programmer Ken (Stephen Fung) runs into a mysterious woman dressed in white in an elevator on his first day on the job. He stays clear of her, fearing that she might be spirit. However, he unknowingly steps into a trap set by a co-worker, whose intentions are not of this world. This story will make you yearn for a vampire or ghost buster of some sorts, as I felt the evil ghost gets its way too much in the story. It would have been nice to see some ghost-busting action instead of seeing humans getting hurt by these baddies.\n\nOverall, though, it&apos;s not a bad horror movie. It&apos;s pretty nicely done with some good acting, great special effects and an above average grade on the creepiness factor.\n\nGrade B-",

      "reviewBody": "Thérèse Raquin (AKA: The Adultress) is directed by Marcel Carné and Carné co-adapts the screenplay with Charles Spaak from the Émile Zola novel. It stars Simone Signoret, Raf Vallone, Jacques Duby, Maria Pia Casilio and Roland Lesaffre. Music is by Maurice Thiriet and cinematography by Roger Hubert.\n\nCarné reworks Zola&apos;s novel to be set in post-war Lyon and slips into a film noir gear. Plot essentially finds Signoret as Raquin, a severely repressed woman stuck in a marriage to her wimpy weasel of a cousin, not only that but she also has to share a home with his domineering mother. Then one day the strapping Laurent LeClaire (Vallone) enters her life, sparking a fiery affair, but as plans for the future are plotted, a turn of events drastically changes everything.\n\nThe characterisations are strongly performed, the five principals (Lesaffre arrives late in the play as a key character) giving performances that really draw you into their respective worlds, for better or worse as regards the human condition. Carné skillfully blends the beautiful side of Lyon, such as the quaint cobbled streets and the River Rhone, with a dull bleakness that fogs Thérèse, a woman who has forgotten how to smile, sexual fulfilment a non entity. Hubert also brings his photographic skills to the show, providing some blisteringly gorgeous night shots that offer hope for the new found lovers. But there is a sign post up ahead and it says that the next stop is noirville, and after having spent half the film building his characters, Carné dashes hope and replaces it with misery. Fate plays a big part in the crux aspects of the film, a film noir staple of course, right up to the clinical finale that comes with a thunderous fait accompli.\n\nIt&apos;s a bit draggy in parts as the director is at pains to show the humdrum side of life, but the change of gear at the mid-point - and the brilliant last quarter, make this a worthy addition for collectors of Frenchie noir. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes, I&apos;m amazed at the low level of commentary on these films.  This one is no exception.  The reviewer opening these comments comments on a &quot;Western&quot; as if this were a Roy Rogers or Gene Autry oater.  While I&apos;m aware that we all have the right to express our views, I would like to see a little more insight on those selecting which reviews will be presented. This film is a remake and reset of the Kurusawa classic and is a classic in its own right.  Fine, fine performances are given by Newman, Harvey, Bloom, Shatner(in his pre-Kirk days), Robinson, Salmi, Da Silva and Fix in this casting of a Japanese film play-- which is a composite of two stories, BTW-- by Akira Kurusawa.  It&apos;s not perfect.  The role of the medium, the old Indian shaman portrayed by veteran character actor, Paul Fix, doesn&apos;t have the cultural impact of the original.  There is confusion around the rape and fight scene, but these are small things.  The film is marvelous and the black and white setting captures much of the shading and light contrasts of the original Rashomon.  The story in both films, which Kurusawa wove out of two earlier stories, is full of archetypes but lacking much of the impending chaos of the original.  The first tale of the old gate at kyoto tells of a ronin confronting an old woman and taking the blanket from an abandoned child in the time of civil war and political upheaval; the other tale, in the woods, tells of the various versions of rape, murder, honor and shame, told by each of the participants.  Kurusawa blended them into an excellent film story.  While the cultural background of the original sets it apart from this American version, there is much that does make it work.  The genteel Southern couple, the Mexican bandido, the pragmatic sheriff, the country preacher, the snake-oil salesman and the miner/prospector, fit the Samurai, bandit, medium, etc., of the original very well. So, face it.  It ain&apos;t John Wayne.  But it&apos;s good cinema at it best."

      "reviewBody": "Miami Golem aka Miami Horror is a saucy little mish mash of adventure. It&apos;s not horror, action or sci-fi; it&apos;s really a tacky combo of Hollywood elements &amp;cliches sort of strung together logically. Stars David Warbeck and Laura Trotter put together solid performances. And the rest of the cast is up to task as well. At the end of his career, Albert DeMartino directs what is essentially a cornball script quite well. Some great photography of Miami is exploited by the filmmakers, in order to hammer home the concept that, this is indeed Miami. Which brings us to the issue of the other word in the title; golem/horror. Now, this little fella is ridiculously silly in appearance, yes. But so was Miami in the 80&apos;s and did I mention the script? Hilarious. As for the music, other reviewers have noted the obvious borrowing of Beverly Hills Cop motifs. But this happens only during the opening credits montage. The rest of the score works very well for helping to propel the corny script. Why the composer Detto Mariano so blatantly &quot;borrowed&quot; Axel&apos;s Theme is anybody&apos;s guess, but again, this is only during the very beginning of the freaking movie, so its not as big a deal as other reviewers have noted. Other musical passages are very dramatic and/or intense. Miami Golem is worth a look if you enjoyed such films as Devil Fish, Pod People or Puma Man. It is a charming little action movie that has ambitions which are reached for with endearing failure. Also I think it is interesting to note that Warbeck &amp; Trotter each appeared in perhaps the 2 most special of all the Italian Horror films released in 1981, The Beyond &amp; Nightmare City, respectively. In my mind these films represent the pinnacle of Italian Horror during the final part of its most amazing era. Although Miami Golem does not come near the level of visceral engagement those films create, it is nonetheless solid, this may almost be top notch entertainment.",

As her high school life is at it&apos;s peak she is forced to relocate to a neighborhood closer to her father&apos;s job. Throughout the movie there is slight racial tension, which I think that the movie could have done with out. And of course, much like the first two movies there&apos;s a sort of &quot;forbidden love interest&quot;.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s an entertaining movie, but I wouldn&apos;t expect for it to win any awards based on content.",

Thus, I have seen many recently made Israeli movies that could easily be categorized as &apos;good&apos;, &apos;better&apos; and &apos;excellent.&apos; Alas, this movie shows that bad movies are still sometimes made there, too. I was really surprised by the rapt, ecstatic reviews given my some of the IMDb denizens. I normally very appreciate the mature, thinking crowd here. But now, guys, I&apos;m sorry to say, it looked like a pseudo-intellectual exercise in making a vain attempt to give some meaning to the bad movie. Kind of reminded me of &apos;underlining metaphors&apos; of the Vogan poetry from the &quot;Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; I completely agree with the reviewer from Israel who gave it 1 star, was glad to find somebody sane at last. The movie had bad script (it looked like that they were filming without script at all, improvising on the fly), bad acting, terrible camera work, awful soundtrack. And if you really want to watch how a family handles the crisis of losing somebody close - watch another Israeli movie &quot;Broken Wings&quot;, an excellent work in all respects.",

And they succeeded.\n\nIn December of 1981 Ryszard Ochodzki (the main hero of another Polish cult comedy, &quot;Mis&quot;) receives an order from colonel Molibden. He has to penetrate Solidarity groups in Suwalki district. He receives a fake photo with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and goes into the action...\n\nThe movie has a very funny script and good acting, but may be not understand outside Poland due to number of references to a Martial Law times and... Polish reality."

Jules Berry, they don&apos;t come any oilier, he&apos;d already scored in a previous Prevert script, &apos;Le Crime du Monsieur Lange&apos; with Renoir on bullhorn and he used this as a warm-up for his Satan in &apos;Visiteurs&apos;.  Arletty?  Garance-in-Waiting, &apos;Hotel du Nord&apos; behind her, &apos;Visiteurs/Enfants&apos; to follow.  Gabin?  What can I say. Even Nat Cole didn&apos;t have a trio like this. To quote the title of an earlier (1935) Gabin vehicle this was truly La Belle Equipe. How Hollywood could cast Hank Fonda in the Gabin role is beyond me. Hank, &apos;aw shucks&apos; Fonda, niceness personified as decent but RUGGED Gabin?  Come on, already.  Vincent Price plays Jules Berry?  Get real! Sandy Trauner&apos;s brilliant apartment building sets the tone here from frame #1.  What an opening, Jules Berry exiting Gabin&apos;s room and running out of breath.  Crowd assembling.  Nowhere-To-Go Gabin holed up in his 10 by 6 reminiscing in Gitane time.  Never had a chance, life&apos;s a bitch and then you die.  Basically that&apos;s all there is to it.  But, as someone once said, it&apos;s the way you tell them. Brilliant in spades."

      "reviewBody": "The Two Jakes and The Godfather 3 were released in the second half of 1990 and both films proved that sometimes it&apos;s best not to tamper with classics. This is not necessarily because sometimes a sequel can&apos;t compliment a classic, but because no matter what you do, there&apos;s no way to avoid comparing the new versions to the old. And the final chapter of the Godfather trilogy is vastly inferior to the first two. And Two Jakes is vastly inferior to Chinatown. But since Chinatown and the first two Godfathers are among the best films every made, that&apos;s a pretty pointless comparison. Just as The Godfather 3 stands on its own as a very sturdy and interesting piece of filmmaking, Two Jakes also works on its own merits. It&apos;s confusing, overlong (a full ten minutes more than the original), and never fully gels, but it&apos;s also passionate, intelligent filmmaking. Go figure.\n\nIn his autobiography, producer Robert Evans refers to Robert Towne&apos;s script for Two Jakes as basically only half-finished. It was half-finished when they started shooting, half-finished when they made it half-way through the shoot, and it pretty much feels half-finished in the final product.  This is a movie where characters wander in and out and a full two-thirds of the storylines go essentially unresolved. The grand climax of the film (and trust me, I&apos;m not spoiling anything) is an evidentiary hearing, for heavens sakes! And I couldn&apos;t really explain the plot if I wanted to, but here&apos;s the quick summary: It&apos;s fifteen years after Chinatown and Jake Gittes Jack Nicholson) has become older, fatter, and a good deal more bitter. He&apos;s now an Investigator respected throughout LA, but he&apos;s still haunted by his experiences with the Mulwrays, especially the late Evelyn. The film begins with a jealous husband, Jake Berman (Harvey Keitel), storming into a hotel room and killing his wife&apos;s lover, with Jake listening in the next room. Of course, you know the crime probably wasn&apos;t entirely about love or lust and that money probably had something to do with it. Money, history, and oil, actually. And it spins in circles from there. \n\nIt&apos;s easy to notice that the film slacks off at around the half-way point. It&apos;s then that you realize just how tight Robert Towne&apos;s Chinatown script was. Even at a shred over two hours, every word counts, every gesture, every twist. Two Jakes is flabby in comparison. The dialogue is pleasantly hardboiled and the actors enjoy delivering it, but the resolutions of the various mysteries mostly fall flat. You either see them coming, or don&apos;t understand when they arrive. It&apos;s to Towne and director Jack Nicholson&apos;s credit that the film ends on a number of satisfying grace notes.\n\nNicholson&apos;s direction is almost never the source of the film&apos;s flaws. And this is legitimately high praise in a film as twisting and convoluted as this. Of course, he again makes you appreciate the brilliant economy of Roman Polanski&apos;s direction of Chinatown, a film with an immeasurable amount of class. Nicholson produces several wonderful moments including a beautiful pull shot from the ocean to a teatime conversation with Kahn (who Chinatown fans will avidly remember). Nicholson and director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond capture a Los Angeles of burnt out dreams, on the brink of overdevelopment and overexpansion. The film has noir stylings but it respectfully looks different from Chinatown.\n\nNicholson&apos;s performance is more a study of what has happened to the actor since Chinatown, rather than what has happened to the character. Because Jack was less of an icon when Chinatown was made, the original Jake Gittes is one of his least iconic performances. By the time he won his Oscar the next year for One Flew Over The Cuckoo&apos;s nest Nicholson had already become JACK (in all caps) and he hasn&apos;t looked back. In Two Jakes, Jake Gittes has become JACK. There&apos;s no getting around it. However, there&apos;s also no getting around the fact that Nicholson is a great actor and even if his performances are frequently variations on a theme, it&apos;s a pretty super theme.\n\nTwo Jakes is peppered with supporting performances of varying degrees of depth. Harvey Keitel has never been better as the second of the two Jakes. His character is emotionally complicated and perhaps the only person in the film (besides Gittes) who gets to go through a character arc.  He plays it wonderfully. The femmes fatale in the film, as played by Madeline Stowe and Meg Tilly are less and more complicated than they seem. Ruben Blade, Richard Farnsworth, and Eli Wallach provide capable support when they&apos;re given anything to do.\n\nThe fact is that like the Godfather 3, if you came upon Two Jakes with a completely open mind, you&apos;d find it a complicated thriller, vastly more substantial than most films of the genre. The fact that it&apos;s got its flaws that it&apos;ll never compare to Chinatown are the basis for a 7/10 rating."

Here they are in their third film together and Blasetti again directs. La Loren is still very much capitalising on her pneumatic physique and sexual charisma but of course one has to play the game with the cards one is dealt! Both she and Mastroianni show even greater assurance in their scenes together which augurs well for the future. There is the added bonus of the consummate Charles Boyer as a Lothario who likes to dine &apos;a la carte&apos; as it were, despite having a delicious set menu at home in the person of Elisa Cegani as his wife. She comes into her own in a priceless scene towards the end. The film is well paced, looks marvellous and the script by D&apos;Amico and Flaiano sparkles. Alessandro Cicognini is again on hand with a typically breezy score. Great to see Boyer in action although he has not alas been &apos;dubbed&apos; very well. Especially good to see the Loren/Mastroianni partnership go from strength to strength with of course their greatest films to come.",

      "reviewBody": "Alex Turner, the director behind the small-scale demonic ghost feature &apos;Dead Birds&apos;, goes once again at the supernatural market (teaming up with &apos;Dead Birds&apos; writer Sam Barrett), in his second feature with the based horror involving American soldiers encountering something otherworldly in the harsh, bone-dry deserts of Afghanistan (and has there been some Sci-fi presentations using that backdrop in the very terrible &apos;Monster Ark&apos; and &apos;Manticore&apos;). It throws up the usual plight that we see themed in these types of genre films in the last decade (Deathwatch, The Bunker and Outpost).\n\nIn-present day Afghanistan a small unit of American soldiers are positioned at an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere to control a strategic road that the Taliban are using. On their way there, they discover an ancient statue which one of the soldiers use for target practice. Unknowingly to them it unleashes a vengeful Djinn, who decides to take out its fury on them.\n\nThe main problem with Turner&apos;s &apos;Red Sands&apos; is that it was all build-up, for nothing. Never did it consolidate any interest in the situation, and the characters are truly hard to care for. The basis is not as compelling as it could have been, because everything feels half-baked and inconsistent. From it&apos;s supernatural element to the mental breakdown of its characters in a foreign culture. This made the script poorly conceived, as not much depth is taken out and there&apos;s plenty of time to do so since is has the soldiers pretty much sitting around. Instead it wants to be vague, but this occasion there&apos;s nothing else going on to let that slide. It&apos;s not weird, creepy or relentless.\n\nNot helping also is the plodding pace and repetitive nature of the actions with the lack of anything really threatening to construct an ounce of suspense, despite there always being a lurking menace (in the Taliban, Djinn or their own sanity&apos;s). The jolts when inserted don&apos;t have much effect, because of the close proximity (where they do come on later in the film). Disappointing in that aspect because the dusty local colour is atmospherically photographed and there&apos;s a genuine feel of place with its isolation and eerie shades. Some moments do create a dreamy, disorientating air and that&apos;s when the howling, uneasy music score awakens.\n\nTurner&apos;s direction is polished in a visual sense, but while he keeps it tight, there&apos;s a real empty and lethargic style to it. The unhinged editing with its jaded dream sequences only grated. It&apos;s a real step down from &apos;Dead Birds&apos;, because there&apos;s nothing remotely creepy here. Sure it&apos;s going for psychological scars, where the friction between the soldiers becoming a tool for supernatural force, but the supposed tension feeding off that angle was dull and annoying. The characters are nothing more than your standard fodder. Shane West is the only recognizable face, and remains acceptable and Mercedes Masöhn has a hypnotic presence on screen. The special effects aren&apos;t so abundant, but when seen it&apos;s weak and clunky. The slipshod Djinn creation is very forgettable.\n\nUnexciting, patchy and so-so execution.",

      "reviewBody": "Yimou Zhang&apos;s &quot;To Live&quot; begins in the late 1940s and covers several decades in the life of Fugui (You Ge), his wife Jiazhen (Li Gong), and their two children. It is an excellent family drama, provoking both laughter and tears, and distinguishing itself from similar movies because of its commitment to showing how China&apos;s changing society affects the family. It takes the huge subject of &quot;the first twenty years of Communism in China,&quot; and brings it down to a human scale.\n\nBoth leading actors nicely portray the way their characters change over the years. At first, Fugui is the stereotypical &quot;callow young man&quot; and Jiazhen the even more stereotypical &quot;long- suffering wife,&quot; but the screenplay and actors eventually deepen the characterizations.\n\nThe best sequence of the film covers the Chinese Civil War. Wisely, Yimou Zhang resists the temptation to make the movie too epic, and instead focuses on Fugui&apos;s personal experiences. The result is a very moving depiction of the human cost of war. In another striking touch, Fugui&apos;s hobby is singing with a shadow-puppet troupe. The puppets not only provide an interesting glimpse into traditional Chinese culture, they also take on a symbolic meaning. \n\nAfter watching &quot;To Live,&quot; it&apos;s easy to see why the Chinese authorities banned it: there&apos;s a lot of tragedy in the film, and in most cases, Communism is to blame. Remarkably, though, Zhang also makes many of the Communist characters sympathetic. For instance, Fugui and Jiazhen&apos;s daughter marries an officer in the Red Guards, who is a little ridiculous in his devotion to Mao Zedong, but not a villain. This is in keeping with the overall spirit of &quot;To Live&quot;--humanistic and subtle, instead of bombastic or propagandistic. It&apos;s both an important examination of recent Chinese history, and a universal story about how individual human beings manage &quot;to live&quot; in times of hardship. A rare combination, and one well worth seeing.",

Valerian (Caitlin Clarke) leads a group to find Ulrich (Ralph Richardson), the only one alive rumored to have killed a dragon. Soldier Tyrian challenges Ulrich to prove himself but the test kills him. His apprentice Galen Bradwarden (Peter MacNicol) with the special amulet intends to complete the quest himself. He discovers that Valerian is actually a girl pretending to be a boy. Tyrian intends to stop anything that could disrupt the way of life and kills Ulrich&apos;s elderly servant Hodge. Hodge tells Galen to spread Ulrich&apos;s ashes over a lake of &quot;burning water&quot;. Galen seals the dragon cave entrance. Thinking it safe, Valerian reveals herself as a girl to the village. Tyrian arrests Galen. In the dungeon, princess Elspeth comes to see Galen and he reveals the popular rumor of the rigged lottery. She rigs the lottery against herself and is sent to be sacrificed.\n\nThis is simple high adventure. Peter MacNicol may not be the pretty young face that the hero is suppose to be. He does have a good nature about it. Caitlin Clarke is a great heroine. Her story is compelling. The princess is great and so is Tyrian. On top of that, Vermithrax is a great scary dragon. He doesn&apos;t show his face until the last act like Jaws. This is one of the great dragon movie.",

In fact, no-on in the cast puts in less than a terrific performance, especially Ziyi Zhang as Kristin and Breslin&apos;s two overlooked children who occasionally threaten to derail the plot (or do they?).\n\nThis is a dark, emotionally raw horror chiller, beautifully directed by Jonas Åkerlund. It seems to be building to something apocalyptic, or at least, something more impressive than the overtly saccharine ending we get.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame the story ends in so anti-climactic a fashion, the journey up to that point is an inventive and interesting one that inspires lots of suspicions about various characters and their motives. A lot of this comes to nothing. My score is 6 out of 10.",

I am proud to have this little seen gem in my collection. Nice story, creepy atmosphere, good acting and a great score make this one worthwhile!!\n\nAlso recommended for fans of little seen 50&apos;s type sci-fi are Mutiny in Outer Space, Satellite in the Sky, On the Threshold of Space, The Magnetic Monster and Riders to the Stars.",

It&apos;s ideally cast and is certainly one of Glenn Ford&apos;s finest roles. He and Shirley MacLaine have marvelous chemistry. Familiar faces Edgar Buchanan, Mickey Shaughnessy,Willis Bouchey,Percy Helton,and Slim Pickins are around to give it the proper old western flavor and Leslie Nielsen is slickly handsome as Ford&apos;s rival for Shirley&apos;s affections. Pernell Roberts is an effectively slimy villain. Director George Marshall was an old hand at combining comedy with action and The Sheepman is one of his best efforts. The screenplay by James Edward Grant and William Bowers was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe Sheepman still holds up well today and will appeal to anyone who is a fan of western&apos;s,comedies,or just plain entertaining movies. It&apos;s good, clean, old fashioned fun and a prime example of one of those kind of films&quot;that they just don&apos;t make anymore!&quot; More&apos;s the pity",

A rather convoluted story which I won&apos;t go into because, though I finally understood it, it&apos;s rather too involved to go into. Needless to say the bad guys ultimately lose and the good guys win. The Sinister Cinema DVD-R is very good quality, probably the best that will ever be available. Recommended for Edgar Wallace",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Uomini sul fondo&quot; (1941) presents a fascinating glimpse into early Italian cinema with its focus on a naval setting. It&apos;s clearly a war propaganda film designed to showcase the supposed prowess of Italian naval technology.\n\nFirst and foremost, the film&apos;s direction is a mixed bag. There are moments of brilliance, particularly in the way the director captures the claustrophobic atmosphere of the submarine. The tight, confined spaces are effectively portrayed, creating a palpable sense of tension. However, there are instances where the pacing falters, and scenes linger longer than necessary, which slightly dilutes the overall impact.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the cinematography is commendable for its time. The use of lighting is particularly notable, with shadows and dim lighting effectively conveying the oppressive environment of the submarine. The camera work, though occasionally static, generally enhances the storytelling by focusing on the actors&apos; expressions and the submarine&apos;s intricate interior. However, there are a few shots that feel redundant and could have been edited out to maintain a tighter narrative flow.\n\nThe set design is another highlight, showcasing a meticulous attention to detail. The submarine&apos;s interior is realistically constructed, contributing to the film&apos;s authenticity. This level of detail immerses the viewer in the story, despite the occasional anachronism that may momentarily pull one out of the period setting.\n\nThe sound design is effective in creating an immersive experience. The creaking of the submarine and the ambient noises of the sea enhance the film&apos;s tension. Nonetheless, there are moments when the dialogue is drowned out by the background sounds, which can be distracting and somewhat frustrating.\n\nRegarding performances, the cast delivers a solid effort, though not without its flaws. The lead actor brings a compelling intensity to his role, skillfully navigating the emotional spectrum required by the narrative. However, some supporting performances fall flat, lacking the same depth and conviction. This inconsistency in acting quality occasionally undermines the film&apos;s dramatic weight.\n\nThe screenplay is well-written, with dialogue that feels authentic and purposeful. The interactions between characters are engaging, although there are moments where the script leans towards melodrama. These instances feel out of place within the otherwise serious tone of the film.\n\nIn terms of direction, there are notable highlights and a few missteps. The director&apos;s ability to build suspense is commendable, yet there are sequences where the tension dissipates due to uneven pacing. This inconsistency hinders the overall momentum of the film.\n\n&quot;Uomini sul fondo&quot; does have its share of technical hiccups. There are minor continuity errors and occasional lapses in logical coherence, but these do not significantly detract from the overall experience. The film&apos;s strengths in set design, atmosphere, and certain performances outweigh these minor flaws.\n\n&quot;Uomini sul fondo&quot; is a film that offers a compelling look at early 1940s Italian cinema. It succeeds in creating an immersive and tension-filled atmosphere, thanks to strong technical elements and a generally solid lead performance. Despite its occasional pacing issues and inconsistent acting, it remains a noteworthy piece for its historical and cinematic value.",

This movie is basically about conflict between those who enforce the law and those who break it to terrorize others. This conflict is the key, and it explores the temptation of law enforcers to break the law to get the terrorists. This theme is perhaps more relevant now than prior to September 11, 2001.\n\nSybil Danning fans get to see her in only a few scenes. This is NOT a sexy movie. Her character (Sally) has a key role in the plot development. Her riding a horse to the climactic confrontation for her character reminds me of classic &quot;maiden in peril&quot; Westerns, and thus ends up being of quite appropriate.",

Just like them Fulvio, is of a wealthy, aristocratic origin and his revolutionary stance is just sentimental, not backed by real-life status. He gets easily disillusioned, but, caught in a moving sand, however he struggles to reclaim his past life he gets trapped and is swallowed in the end.

Now i will try to persuade the many that haven&apos;t still seen this fiction to do it. This is an ironic fiction that talk about the life in two different and opposite way:misery and nobility. The comic verve of Totò, i think the best Italian actor of ever, make this comedy one of the best work of ever. Every time i see it i smile and laugh but i reflect also about the magnificent message that is mixed on the jokes... the worlds can be never enough my opinion should be like an advice to see it. a masterpiece.

      "reviewBody": "Sudden Fear (1952)\n\nSuch a dark and dramatic, noir-styled surprise for me. Joan Crawford as the rich daughter and talented playwright is terrific, avoiding the camp of later years and really playing a complex, emotional role perfectly. I didn&apos;t even notice that Gloria Grahame was in it, and when she shows up I knew there was going to be a thrill--she balances Crawford, and gives the third main actor, Jack Palance, a way to bounce back and forth. And Palance, as a seeming actor/lover, is two-sided and then some, and really gives the part depth. He&apos;s so believably likably it&apos;s chilling.\n\nAdd to this some of the darkest, and most shadowy, night photography you&apos;ve seen, and a hard hitting orchestral score, and fast editing up and down the streets of San Francisco, and you&apos;ve got a gem. It&apos;s an amazing, over-the-top movie, but it makes sense, and the last shot of Joan Crawford at night (I&apos;ll say no more) is astonishing for its emotional shifts. Yes, there is Mildred Pierce and countless other great Crawford films, but for her performance alone you have to see this one. Director David Miller I&apos;ve never heard of and may never hear of again judging by his film history, but he pulls off a stylish, intense masterpiece. It&apos;s filled with common types and common twists, but a lot of them, and well done, well done.",

Jackson to lesser-knowns Connie Nielsen and Taye Diggs, ably unravels the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a reviled army sergeant during a hardcore training outing. The episode is recounted in as many ways by as many witnesses, an interesting method that has worked so well in other films such as COURAGE UNDER FIRE. It may all seem confusing at first, but gifted director John McTiernan gradually weaves everything together, though perhaps not as seamlessly as one would ideally prefer.\n\nBASIC is not without its flaws, but they are not as glaring as one might think from professional reviews, or even many of the comments on this website. Its originality is welcome at a time when so many films follow the same cookie-cutter formula.",

      "reviewBody": "I spent over a decade watching and reviewing films for my job at MTV Europe. Even before and since I voraciously consume cinema of truly all kinds as a passion, I don&apos;t care about genre or even subject, only that a work is honest, inspired, effective. As with any art, of course. \n\nI saw The Indian Runner at its Cannes film festival debut in 1991 and left the Grand Palais screening speechless. Where to start? We often hear about the usual checklist of script, acting, cinematography, editing, music, and so on, and of course all are stellar here. But it&apos;s the magic of the mix of all these and so many more subtleties about the experience of this film that makes it not just a terrific, achingly beautiful thing, moving, illuminating, but, I believe, having revisited it so many times over the last thirteen years (like so very few others among the hundreds seen once), one that is important and bound for a belated re- positioning as a cinematic gem in the history books of the future.\n\nCassavetes is clearly a major force behind this in the best possible way; he&apos;d have stood up and applauded the way Penn took his spirit, his openness and gave it a more cinematic scope, color, pace, size, without compromising his own direct gaze on the human condition. Before this film Cassavetes&apos; huge contribution had not been properly picked up, the baton in some respects still dangling where the late auteur had left it years back. In Indian Runner Penn points the way forward for this bold tone of cinematic voice (in a way to my mind even more clear than in his subsequent The Crossing Guard and The Pledge). The moment at the start of the film when Joe&apos;s dead victim&apos;s father begins singing a work song at the police station still stands out as the revelation that this movie had its own palette. I could go on and on but I&apos;d probably bore... even ME (like Frank, no?).\n\nWhat struck me in Cannes and forever since is how this massive achievement was so overlooked by other critics and then the public. I felt I was simply out of step but never wavered in my commitment to the film as a private cause which I&apos;m pleased to say everyone I&apos;ve talked into seeing it has agreed during exciting post-mortems. Also, as with great works in general, I notice it only gets better with repeated visits over the years. And seeing the comments about it on this site has cheered me up no end. I&apos;m not alone!\n\nIt&apos;s one thing for a film to endure; another entirely for it to emerge from obscurity years after it was made and left aside. That very trajectory, likely, it seems now, for The Indian Runner, is going to become one of its many very special qualities. Conversations about its simple and complex strengths are gaining a new dimension with this look into what it was that made it so inaccessible to most of its viewers for its first decade and what it is and will be that finally unmasks the gem that until now was so oddly neglected. Suddenly it&apos;s on DVD and people are discussing it. Could it be good taste or whatever you call this kind of appreciation is on the rise? Wow. Reasons to be cheerful indeed. \n\nAnd for those of us who first came across Viggo Mortenson here, imagine how itchy it made us sitting through his fine but passionless Lord of the Rings!\n\nHere&apos;s to poetry, vision, and honesty about pain and life without judgment. Lord knows it&apos;s rare these days.",

      "reviewBody": "SON OF THE RED CORSAIR (the English language title of this film) was made in 1958 (but not shown in the US until 1963), so this film predates Lex Barker&apos;s ascension into German stardom via the Dr. Mabuse films and eventually the series of westerns based on Karl May novels. During the 58-61 period he made a number of costume historical dramas in Italy, most of which are worth watching if you can find them. This exciting entry casts Barker as a Spanish count who is the son of the Red Corsair, a legendary pirate. He is simultaneously avenging his father&apos;s death, looking for his long-lost sister, romancing a lovely Marquise, and fighting off various enemies. You name it, this film has it--swordfights, romance, mystery, music and dance, comedy sequences, etc. It all works well and moves quickly,and the film packs a lot into 80 minutes. Barker is tough yet charming, elegant yet earthy. And he manages to keep a straight face while wearing various powdered wigs and/or ponytails! The dubbing is acceptable by the standards of the day. Director Primo Zeglio directed many costume historical dramas in the 50s and early 60s--including Morgan the Pirate with Steve Reeves and Seven Seas to Calais with Rod Taylor as Sir Francis Drake (a film often shown on TCM in the USA). In the mid-60s he directed four westerns (two under psuedonyms), including the excellent Cursed Valley with Ty Hardin. He also directed the cult favorite sci-fi Perry Rhodan epic MISSION STARDUST starring Lang Jeffries (which, if you think about it, is just another kind of costume historical drama in a different time/setting!). Unfortunately, the SWV video of SON OF THE RED CORSAIR, the film reviewed here, is a pan-and-scan black and white TV print of a film shot and released in color and widescreen. The film will surely be an awesome experience on DVD someday... Until then, even this b&amp;w version is entertaining enough to be worth your finding a copy if you are a Barker fan or a fan of Italian swashbucklers of the era. They don&apos;t make them like this anymore and there will never be another Lex Barker.",

I&apos;ve heard a few criticisms regarding the acting etc, and I can&apos;t imagine what they were referring to. Corey Feldman was very good (It&apos;s about time he got another American lead role. He was excellent in Lucky Fritz and The Birthday) and all the main characters played their parts well. The women were even age appropriate and had character, which is very rare in a horror movie these days. It didn&apos;t even feel like a low budget movie (smart scripts can fix that) unless you compare the cast of the Original which is always unfair. It must be judged for what it is, a high energy, funny, gory and entertaining movie! Well worth a watch...or 2 or 3 maybe.\n\nNow Feldman can use his DVD star power to executive produce Meatballs 5 and Rock&apos;n Roll Highschool Forever and Ever and Ever!...Or just keep making good movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Short and sweet, bright and breezy, but not without pith, this early Preston Sturges feature helped further establish his &quot;wonder-kid&quot; reputation in the early 40&apos;s before his great classics &quot;Sullivan&apos;s Travels&quot;, &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; and my favourite &quot;Hail The Conquering Hero&quot;.\n\nThe simple premise of a hoax win in a national coffee-slogan competition for ordinary average nice-guy Powell is the springboard for a light morality tale along the lines of &quot;he who does good has good things happen to them&quot; - although not without the usual series of ups and downs, just as you&apos;d expect.\n\nOf course nobody here is really bad, even the duped killjoy Mr, no make that Dr Maxford of the sponsoring coffee company or Mr Shindler of the too-trusting department store from whom Powell buys gifts for the whole neighbourhood on the strength of the phony winning telegram placed on his desk by his prankster work colleagues. Even when he finds out that his win is bogus, Powell can&apos;t get angry at the tricksters, so it&apos;s no real surprise that his homeliness, honesty and humility wins everyone over, including his feisty girl-friend, played by Ellen Drew, with the predictable twist in the last reel that Powell&apos;s slogan wins anyway.\n\nPowell is very likeable in the lead, although Drew is a little too high-pitched in delivery for my taste as the film develops. There&apos;s the usual troop of madcap eccentrics which peoples almost every Sturges comedy, with some nice little cameos, I particularly liked the actor playing the deadpan cop, not above making some contemporary allusions to Hitler &amp; Mussolini to stress a point.\n\nThe dialogue of course is mile-a-minute vernacular and I got a kick out of Sturges&apos; Dickensian word-play over triple-barrelled lawyer&apos;s names (along the lines of &quot;Swindle Cookum and Robbem!&quot;). Right from the start, we get the &quot;screwball comedy&quot; template of a poor Joe and his girl, dreaming of something bigger waiting for something extraordinary to happen, with Powell and Drew&apos;s extended night-time scene on their New York apartment roof-top, and succeeding entertaining scenes including Powell&apos;s reaction to &quot;winning&quot; the competition and best of all the frenetic crowd scene when Maxford tries to get his money back only to cop a batch of rotten fruit (&quot;Don&apos;t throw the good stuff&quot; admonishes one parent to a tomato-wielding youngster), it&apos;s all good clean fun and ends up happily ever after. And get a load of that &quot;zoom&quot; shot back into Maxford&apos;s office at the end - it certainly got me out of my chair, not the last time Sturges employed camera tricks of this type - remember the memorable stop-start sequence to &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot;.\n\nThe movie celebrates community, the little guy who dreams of making it big and how to meet disaster with alacrity, in short a feel-good movie with a big heart, well worth an hour and four minutes of anyone&apos;s time.",

But it was well written, capably directed, and Verraros, Hand, and Kochan gave good, hysterically funny performances. I wouldn&apos;t have guessed the latter two had any talent based on Eating Out, but it seems that was all Q. Allan Brocka&apos;s doing rather than the fault of the actresses. Working with Bartell&apos;s words and direction they&apos;re a delight to watch. Brett Chuckerman isn&apos;t quite as charismatic as Ryan Carnes was in the same role, but he does a good job. And Marco Dapper... is very, very good looking. (Hey, just because it turned out to be a good movie doesn&apos;t mean they forgot the eye candy...) \n\nI&apos;d recommend it to anyone looking for a funny, sexy movie to spend some time with.",

A lot of them do contain gore and do have nudity. But still that doesn&apos;t make a movie, you also need a good script.\n\nThe script here looked fine but it doesn&apos;t work flawless on screen. Some parts are a bit boring but the nudity makes it all up. It do contains a lot of red stuff and here and there we do have a bit of gory scene&apos;s but for Japanese standards it&apos;s low and most of the slashing or killings are done off-screen. The acting didn&apos;t provided any extra. You don&apos;t watch those movies for the acting. But being low on the gore site there are much better flicks out.\n\nBut if you are into those typical Japanese flicks with student look-a-likes then this is one to see. Of course it sometimes goes over the top with the sputtering of blood and some girls really get covered with the red stuff. The end is also over the top with a girl having extra powers coming out of her, well, you can guess it. \n\nIt&apos;s not all that bad but as I said, there&apos;s better to catch.\n\nGore 2/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",

Ruth Leuwerik is the carrot-topped protagonist, at wit&apos;s end over her disappointing marriage and disillusioning secondary romance. She drops both husband and lover to head to Venice, hoping there to land a job and to enjoy a more fulfilling life. Each person with whom Leuwerik comes in contact is also running away from himself or herself; so much for Venice. After being victimized by deceivers and exploited by self-absorbed martyrs, Leuwerik wearily returns home.\n\nWell-intended but somewhat muddled picture that sealed Ruth Leuwerik&apos;s fate as box-office cyanide after a string of monumental flops. Her performance is very subtle, giving the over-complicated story its little coherence.\n\nKaeutner, who just vowed critics and public alike with the superb adaption of &apos;Ein Glass Wasser&apos; with Gustav Gruendgrens, Hilde Krahl and an overwhelming Liselotte (Lilo) Pulver in the leads, is ill-at-ease with this very talky weltschmerz material."

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps you&apos;ve heard about the great-but-neglected comedian Charley Chase, and perhaps you wonder what was so great about him. If so, this nicely polished gem from Chase&apos;s silent era heyday would be a good place to start an acquaintance. Judged on a bare plot outline Innocent Husbands might sound like a run-of-the-mill marital farce, the sort of two-reeler comics like Leon Errol cranked out by the dozen, but the difference lies in the execution. Charley Chase was a charming, agile performer with a highly expressive face and a lanky build, rather like a cross between Dick Van Dyke and John Cleese. Chase also possessed a gift for physical comedy and a fertile imagination for gags, which he demonstrated not only in his own movies but also when he directed films featuring his peers.\n\nWhen I speak of &quot;physical comedy,&quot; by the way, I don&apos;t mean the sort of primitive butt-kicking slapstick found in the early Mack Sennett comedies. Like many of his contemporaries Charley Chase&apos;s film-making apprenticeship took place at the Keystone Studio during World War I, but by the &apos;20s he&apos;d refined his skills to the point where his work was comparatively sophisticated, with an occasional touch of the risqué. One example from this film: when Charley is sent to an apartment building to fetch a young lady to bring to a party. He is told to stand in front of her building and whistle three times; this will be her signal to throw down her room key. Charley dutifully stands before the building and whistles three times-- and is pelted with dozens of keys! Maybe that isn&apos;t your idea of &quot;sophisticated,&quot; but it&apos;s miles ahead of a Keystone food fight. Next we have a funny scene where Charley actually has to fend off the hot-to-trot young lady in the back of a cab. He&apos;s not merely an innocent husband, but one who has to FIGHT to uphold his virtue!\n\nThis is the sort of farce in which an obsessively jealous wife tries to catch her husband cheating. He&apos;s innocent, like the title says, and yet he eventually winds up-- innocently, of course --with an unconscious floozy in his bedroom, and must scramble to conceal her presence. Again, what makes it work is the freshness Chase brings to this admittedly familiar material. A highlight comes early on, when Melvin (Charley&apos;s character) tells his wife Mame that he&apos;s become so tired of her suspicions he&apos;s going to end it all. He stomps into the next room, finds a revolver, fires it into the floor and falls, in a histrionic manner. No response. So, naturally, he does it again. Still nothing. Now Mame opens the door to watch as Melvin performs this ridiculous act a third time. Flat on the floor Melvin looks up, realizes Mame is watching, and quickly resumes playing dead. This may not sound so funny in the telling, and God knows plenty of lesser comics have performed similar routines to little effect, but trust me, when Charley Chase does this, it&apos;s funny. Innocent Husbands is a comic treat that deserves to be better known, and so does its star performer.",

      "reviewBody": "This might easily be one of the most nihilistic flicks i&apos;ve ever seen. Despite IMDb currently labelling it as &apos;horror thriller&apos;, it seems it was supposed to be more like a mixture of slasher/thriller, drama/romance and a bit of comedy. However, it fails at each: It&apos;s thriller without suspense, a slasher without on-screen killings, a drama/romance without any tangible emotions, a comedy without one laugh.\n\nBland story made of generic thriller tropes, while the writers constantly deny the number one rule in screen writing - &quot;SHOW, DON&apos;T TELL!&quot; - in a way that basically all information (characterizations, their relationships, motivations, background story) are merely given in form of dialogue. If you can&apos;t SHOW a story, but only TELL it via dialogue, you should rather release it as a book or radio play, instead of shooting an audio-visually dull movie like that.\n\nOh yes, since the movie takes place on a luxury liner, i was at least expecting a rather fancy set - but no, most of it are just boring medium shots of talking characters...\n\nBottom line: The only positive things about this movie are its shorter-than-usual runtime and the actors still trying to make a professional job, while anything else appears to be carried out on amateur level.\n\nBy the way, note the &quot;mirror scare&quot;! You will probably not get a more nihilistic variation of this horror trope anywhere - which is very exemplary for the entire movie.",

I had no expectations going in, since it was the directorial debut for Richard Ayoade. He did a wonderful job with this film. It was beautifully shot and directed and the cast, although unknowns to me were unbelievably good! I didn&apos;t understand a few jokes since I didn&apos;t understand a bit of the British humour, but most of the jokes were universally understandable which is great. Overall I gave it a 9 out of 10 and I can&apos;t wait until it gets distributed worldwide so I can see it again. I hope Richard Ayoade starts working on another film soon, because I&apos;m excited to see what else he can do.",

      "reviewBody": "Many positive superlatives could not express the brilliance of this film. It astounds me that given the rather un-original state Hollywood has been in since 1980 (and continues to be in with the blatant and dull John Travolta rip-off of Phenomenon in 1996) that such a wonderful film was given the green light. It is always a rarity to see this type of masterpiece hit the screen... and a pleasure too. There was much controversy surrounding this film upon its initial release... mostly of the kind that had nothing to do with the actual movie. To that I can only say one thing... it takes more then one person to make a movie! Get over it. Besides the clever, thought provoking, tender, respectful and intelligent script penned by Victor Salva, he also does a top-notch job in the direction. I loved this movie, I own this movie and I whole-heartedly recommend it to everyone."

      "reviewBody": "The film is set in a village in the outskirts of Bathinda city where villagers work in the fields of the local landlord. It is a village where people are trying hard to make peace with their existence.\n\nOn a foggy winter morning, a family wakes up to the news of the demolition of a house on the outskirts of the village. Father, a silent sympathizer, joins the community in demand for justice whilst his son Melu, a rickshaw puller in the city, participates in a strike by his union. Injured and alienated, Melu spends the day quietly resting and drinking with friends in the night they debate the meaning of their existence. Both father and son are equally clueless about their futures.\n\nThe film is a powerful exploration of the daily struggles of the urban and rural workers in a Punjab; where the gap between the rich and poor is getting wider and people&apos;s hopes and aspirations for a better life are shattered.\n\nAs the director says, it is difficult to say what the film is about as it can mean different things to different people, which it should. At the surface, the film speaks about the margins where the socially repressed and exploited have been conveniently cast away. It&apos;s about a day in the lives of a family who are witnesses to the play of power equation unfolding around them. It&apos;s about silent witnesses devoid of power to change or influence the course of destiny. It&apos;s about invisible violence and desires, simmering discontent and angst that are reflected on people&apos;s faces.\n\nThe village portrayed is not the picture-perfect Bollywood village with verdant mustard fields and huge private mansions. It showcases the underbelly of caste&apos;ism and marginalized farmers. The helplessness and angst of Dalit&apos;s in a village in Punjab is beautifully captured.\n\nAmazing part is that most of the actors in the movie are not real actors, but real villagers of the same village where the film is shot.\n\nThe creative producer of the movie, Mani Kaul, known for critically acclaimed movies like Uski Roti (1970) &amp; Duvidha (1974) was also mentor of the director, which is clearly reflected in his style. Mani&apos;s parting words before the director left for the shoot were: &quot;Go beyond what you know!&quot; and the director says, &quot;I would start feeling dissatisfied if things were going too much according to the plan. I kept struggling with Mani&apos;s thought. Having finished the film, now I know what he meant!&quot; Gurvinder&apos;s style doesn&apos;t share much of functional details, although the way he handles the sounds, the empty frames &amp; the silence, is incredible. This is what would probably alienate him from taking the film to a wider audience. He seems happier experimenting with the notions of time and space within a filmic narrative.\n\nAnhey Ghorey Da Daan is nevertheless a rewarding watch for those who are open to not treading the beaten path!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Sisters&quot; is not seen often these days. It is a curiosity piece because it&apos;s a minor Bette Davis film in which she plays an ordinary woman, a departure from some of her other more intense dramas we are more accustomed to seeing. As directed by Anatole Litvak, the film doesn&apos;t show anything new.\n\nThe story about the Eliott sisters from Montana, is mildly interesting. The Eliott household is a happy one. We see them at the beginning of the film as they are preparing for the election night ball in their small town in which Theodore Roosevelt is the winner in the presidential race. The three sisters make a quite an attraction among the young male population because their good looks.\n\nWhat appears to be a nice family when we first meet them, suddenly fades into memory as the three sisters go in different directions, as life intervenes along the way. Louise, the older sister, proves to be a survivor, if only she has to experience a lot in her own life before real happiness can be achieved. Helen, the beautiful middle sister, marries an older man who offers her security. Grace, the younger one, is the only one to stay in town and marries Tom.\n\nLouise experiences the worst fate of all the sisters when she finds herself abandoned in San Francisco by her husband Frank. He wants to get away from the scene of his failure in order to prove himself worthy of Louise&apos;s love. By going overseas as a merchant seaman, he wants to see if he can make any good out himself. Louise is in the middle of the 1906 earthquake and loses all she had.\n\nAt the end, all sisters are back home on another election night ball as they watch Willliam Taft being proclaimed as president of the nation. Their lives come together at the end, as all find peace.\n\nThe most exciting time in the film centers around the vivid scenes of the San Francisco earthquake. It&apos;s done in a realistic manner. Louise is helped by the next door neighbor, a woman of easy morals, who turned out to be a real friend.\n\nThe performances are good, but don&apos;t expect any sparks from the subdued Louise of Bette Davis. Ms. Davis gives a nuanced performance. The problem is, one expected an over the top star turn by the actress, and her Louise is the epitome of common sense and kindness. Errol Flynn, as Frank, the deserting husband, is seen in a different role as well. He is not as dashing and debonair as in his signature performances, but in spite of playing against type, his take on Frank gives another dimension of his acting range.\n\nThe beautiful Anita Louise makes an interesting contribution to the film. Ian Hunter as the kind Mr. Benson, also adds to the picture. The wonderful Lee Patrick plays Flora, the good neighbor, with conviction. Donald Crisp makes another great appearance as Frank&apos;s friend. Henry Travers and Beulah Bondi are seen as the Eliott sister&apos;s parents. Jane Bryan, as Grace has some good moments, but she is eclipsed by the more interesting older sisters.\n\nThis is a film to watch Bette Davis and Errol Flynn playing roles that are completely different from others we are used to see them in.",

I will say that John Travolta is good dancer and his character is actually rather well portrayed here. But the film itself: ZOMG. The dance sequences are cheesy as hell. I have almost hurt myself from laughing so hard. It&apos;s like everyone in the movie lives in a world where cruise ship shows are considered the apex of entertainment. The script is a knock off of a knock off of a knock off of 42nd Street, with obvious rip-offs of All That Jazz. The choreographer character is straight out of the book of Hollywood clichés. The love triangle is as flimsy and transparent as used Saran wrap. The songs are all ridiculously over-earnest, especially the echo-laden &apos;Dance Close to the Fire&apos; sequence. But I gotta say: watching this is pure joy. Pure &apos;oh my god I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m watching this&apos; guilty pleasure joy."

As Jerry once again is more clever and wins the cat and mouse games. More tough for Tom to take is that his new master book called how to catch and trap a mouse clearly does not work! As bear traps, mallets, and a tree swing all backfires on Tom! Plus the final insult is even an electronic female mouse wind up does not even lure Jerry for Tom&apos;s lunch! Overall super great episode of the series!",

      "reviewBody": "This film has been compared to &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; not because of the story itself, but the way it is told, and through innovative artistic devices. The screenplay is highly poetic even when describing destruction, death, and madness.  Several jump cuts in time occur with voice-over, and, at the beginning, voice-over during a montage of frightening images from the aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing and the bodies of the two lovers in bed. The characters represent different cities; the Japanese man, Hiroshima, the French woman, a city in France, Nevers (was this intentional?), but the latter might as well represent any outside nation.  While &quot;Hiroshima,&quot; even after being destroyed by an &quot;ally&quot; of France, falls in love with her and wants her to stay, despite his claims that she can never know what the bombing was really like, yet leaving this in the past without forgetting, &quot;France&quot; is hung up on a dead Nazi soldier whom she had loved, and became an outcast because of it.  What the soldier really seems to represent is not the Nazis, but rather a real, true love that transcended nationalities and associations.  France&apos;s past is personal and fears forgetting it, while Hiroshima&apos;s is communal and, while not wanting to forget, also wants to move ahead.  For this reason Hiroshima keeps trying to convince France to stay so that they can be in love, but France is too preoccupied with its own personal ghost that it cannot share, which is why it is a major breakthrough for her when she tells her tragic story for the first time to anyone, Hiroshima.  Hiroshima&apos;s past tragedy being communal is shared and it wants to share with the rest of the world.  France&apos;s tragedy is personal and is only beginning to be shared.  It takes the entire film before the two characters can get to a beginning of something more than their differences and likenesses of tragedy and loss in the past, and this beginning is who they really are, in the present, two people reborn from these tragedies.",

There is such a story to tell about the Windtalkers, and he hardly told anything.  The action was convincing enough but I wondered about some of the characterizations. Actually this was just an ordinary action film under the guise of telling the story of the Windtalkers. I guess I was just expecting more of a story, and a little less of the noisy action."

In &quot;Falling Down&quot;, Michael Douglas has brought to life one of the most believable, likeable, and disturbing antiheroes of all time. It&apos;s a poignant tale of the everyman finally getting sick of the various stupidities, banalities, and irritabilities (I&apos;m coining that if it&apos;s not already a word) that plague our modern life. It&apos;s a film that, at the beginning is as hilarious as it is true, but as the film continues, it proceeds to become more real, more disturbing, but also more grounded in its message. It&apos;s ridiculous and insane, but it also cuts deep to the truths that all of us feel at times. I&apos;ve seen a number of Joel Schumacher&apos;s films, but this is the only one I could imagine myself watching multiple times. It depicts the American dream better than most films out there. It shows the everyman&apos;s struggle to conquer what he believes is wrong. It gives us a person to root for who is idealistic and filled with bravado, but also a man who is seriously flawed. I really believe this picture was ahead of its time; it didn&apos;t get incredible reviews, but I&apos;d argue it&apos;s Joel Schumacher&apos;s crowning achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "The story is set in East Germany in 1980, when it looked like Communism would last forever. Central character is Dr. Barbara Wolff, played by the classically beautiful blonde Nina Hoss, who I&apos;ve previously seen in A Woman In Berlin. Dr. Wolff was a fast track young doctor at the Charite, the big teaching hospital in Berlin, before she fell in love with a West German businessman and applied for an exit visa. That got her a short spell in prison for ingratitude to the workers and farmers who paid for her medical education, together with a transfer to a one horse town in Mecklenburg, where she seems to be the second doctor in a two doctor pediatric clinic. We know all this because, as she is getting off the bus, the local Stasi man is going through her file with Andre, the head doctor at the clinic. Andre is what they used to call an Inoffiziale Mitarbeiter, or unofficial cooperator. We find out why later on. He&apos;s also an attractive, shambling 30 something bachelor in a kind of teddy bear way, a skilled, dedicated doctor with a good bedside manner, and, notwithstanding his work as an informer, a pretty decent guy by the standards of the time and place.\n\nBarbara twigs immediately that Andre&apos;s an informer when he offers her a lift home from work on the first day. As they drive through an intersection in his piece of crap Trabant, she says, &quot;you were supposed to ask me which way to turn, but then, you already know where I live.&quot; She is resentful, understandably so, and standoffish, which the clinic staff put down to stuck up Berlin attitude. That may have something to do with the open surveillance by the Stasi guy and regular searches of her apartment, complete with strip searches by a female agent. But Barbara is also a first class doctor who takes a real interest in her patients. Andre is quietly smitten -- if you&apos;ve seen Hoss you&apos;ll know why -- and keeps chipping away at her resistance. Despite knowing who else he works for, she can&apos;t help responding.\n\nWhat neither Andre nor the Stasi agent know is that Barbara is contriving to meet her Wessi boyfriend when he&apos;s in the East on business, and they&apos;re scheming to smuggle her out. He&apos;s crazy about her, even saying that he&apos;d move East if she wants, but there are slight intimations that life in the West with him might not be exactly as she&apos;s dreamed of. In any event, there&apos;s a lot of sneaking about, and Hoss has a good line in tense body language and over the shoulder glances. Everybody knows everybody&apos;s business in a small town anyway, and in a small town in Mecklenburg, your landlady, your co-workers, or anyone you pass on the street could be an informer. \n\nComplications ensue, involving Andre, the escape plan, and Barbara&apos;s obligations to two young patients in whom she has taken a special interest. I won&apos;t tell you how they play out, except that nothing goes quite as expected. The movie gives you a very good sense of a society in which everyone is compromised in some way, trust and intimacy are not really possible, but life has to go on nevertheless. It&apos;s not as showy as The Lives of Others, but it gives a better sense of what everyday life was like in the German Democratic Republic, where it has been estimated that there was one Stasi employee for every 165 citizens and one informer for every 6.5.",

      "name": "Das Jahr der ersten Küsse - The 80&apos;s in Germany in one film",
      "reviewBody": "Emmanuelle, a French singer, knew what she said when she sang (in translation) &quot;It is not forgotten, when it&apos;s the very first time&quot;. She was referring to the first kiss. Despite being made a decade later, in a different country, &quot;Das Jahr der ersten Küsse&quot; shows that too. In this case, that kiss is just the occasion to do a little tour of Germany in the 80&apos;s, as experienced by a group of teenagers.\n\nThe protagonist, and narrator of the story is 15 year-old Tristan. Everything in his life is going well; he has a group of friends, all of them loving in their way, and his parents have no troubles in their relationship. All this changes when they start arguing, and, as if of a sudden, they decide to divorce. Tristan is devastated. Not only has he to leave his neighborhood in order to live with his mother, but he still hasn&apos;t managed to kiss his crush, Kerstin. Knowing that he has no time left, he puts all his effort to make this teenage dream come true.\n\nIf this sounds innocent, don&apos;t be fooled. Teenage enthusiasm runs rampant in this coming-of-age film, with the teens experimenting with drugs, and having their first albeit mild, sexual experiences. Still, this is no reason for one to be turned off. The film offers an extremely realistic portrayal of teenage behaviour, that is, a mix of childishness and relevant maturity. The friends support each other, especially the one who comes from an abusive household. It is though them that she can find joy. Instead of the quite ironic view on teenagers that other films offer, this one doesn&apos;t try at all to teach moral lessons. It promotes carelessness and happiness, these two being maybe the most important characteristics of teenage psychology.\n\nThe age in which this film takes place was also one of carelessness. And it was shown with detail during the film. The atmosphere of the era comes off from every aspect of the film. Tristan has wallpapers of stars in his room from the famous teen magazine BRAVO, then one of the most pioneering publications related to teenagers. The friends organise parties where they dance slows, like their favourite movie characters from &quot;La Boum&quot;. Opus&apos;s &quot;Live is life&quot; plays, as Tristan enters the party room. Aerobic shows play on TV, and Tristan&apos;s mum follows the moves of the presenter. The teenagers go to dance school, it being one of the most popular extracurricular activities in which their parents sent them, wanting them to find their hidden talents.\n\nMost importantly, the feeling of freedom that characterised this time exists. For all the problems around them, the heroes continue living their lives as if there&apos;s no tomorrow. Not yet affected from the environmental tragedies of the late 80&apos;s, - the movie takes place in 1985- they have no worries, and spend their days wondering how to win each other&apos;s hearts.\n\nFriendship is everything for these heroes. For, they live in a time where the only way to communicate is through letters, and in some cases, the telephone. This is why when Tristan leaves for his new home, we can&apos;t but feel pity for him. We can&apos;t but think that he was born a little too early. Now, distance friendships can be kept more easily. Or so it seems. But can this age of of constant anxiety be compared with Tristan&apos;s one, the one of nostalgia, the one of innocence? It depends. But this film provides a portrait of this age that mostly emphasizes the positive elements, and through them, constructs an image that partly fails to recognise the negative aspects. We mustn&apos;t forget that the heroes lived through the Cold War.\n\nIt seems as if they forgot that. As if this wasn&apos;t their business. For them, what was important was to cherish the moments of happiness stemming from the fact that they were teenagers. This was the generation that would later elevate their age to the reputation it enjoys today. For, aside from the amazing films, the unforgettable TV shows, and the legendary magazines, this when they also had one of the most significant experiences of teenage life.\n\nThe first kiss.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;In Country&quot; is what soldiers called being in Viet Nam during the war, thus the title of this 1989 film. Emily Lloyd, an 18-year-old English actress credibly plays Sam (Samantha) who is being raised by her uncle (Bruce Willis) while her mother (Jane Allen) lives elsewhere in Kentucky. Sam wonders about her father, who was killed in Viet Nam right before she was born. She found old letters of his to her mom, and this sparks her interest in finding out more about him.  The film ends when she finds his name in D.C. at the memorial.\n\nI was drafted in 1968, and only a medical disqualification kept me out of Viet Nam. I&apos;m certain that some of my college buddies, and ROTC mates, went and never returned. For us who remember those times this is an especially meaningful film. It is slow moving in many places, but well-done and perhaps deserving of a bit higher rating on the IMDb.\n\nThis is one of the many older movies now being released as budget DVDs. It sold for under $6. It is very basic, no extras, no surround sound. Still, the picture is very true, in fullscreen, and the sound is above average. Includes some good Bruce Springsteen."

      "reviewBody": "About six months ago I copied a bunch of movies I&apos;ve been meaning to watch onto my laptop in hopes that while on a trip, or over my mom&apos;s doing laundry, I would find the time and effort to watch them. A few of them I have watched, but largely this group of 6 or 7 films has gone untouched. Today I finally got the will to watch a film called The Zero Boys.\n\nI had download.. erhm, I mean rented it about 4 or 5 months ago after I re-watched the 80&apos;s Dawn of the Dead inspired slasher-flick: Chopping Mall. While browsing the IMDb, I noticed that cult actress and Night of the Comet alum Kelli Maroney was in a film described as an &quot;action / slasher / horror&quot; film. I had to see this.\n\nAfter watching the film and while doing my dishes, I was trying to concoct a clever and hip metaphor for this film: &quot;it&apos;s what a teen slasher film would be like if Polanski directed it.&quot; No, Polanski would make it more confusing. &quot;It&apos;s like a Golan-Globus produced slasher film.&quot; Maybe, but a film produced by those great Greek gods of Chuck Norris would&apos;ve put more than only one explosion in it, and surely there&apos;d be boobies. As I continued these ridiculous metaphors in my head, the more I realized that as much as The Zero Boys failed as a film, it was strikingly entertaining.\n\nThe film opens during a &quot;weekend warrior&quot; game between two groups of college-aged kids. The clever director of this film, Nico Mastorakis, has cut this opening scene with such disguise -- it FEELS as though something quite real is going on here, but we soon realize it&apos;s just a game of paint ball (and a dull one at that). This is where we are introduced to our main character: Steve. Steve is a strong, leader type pretty boy with a patented 80s haircut. His two friends Rip and Larry are apparently the kings of paint ball, as they have just defeated some kid in a Nazi uniform.\n\nThe plot really thickens up when we learn that the Nazi kid has wagered his own girlfriend on his paint ball skills. Not only has Steve won $20, he has now earned the right to court the buxom, catty, blond Jamie (played by the aforementioned Kelli Marony).\n\nSoon the group are somehow on a picnic in the woods, and sooner then you can say &quot;Sam Raimi,&quot; they&apos;ve found a creepy looking deserted cabin. For one reason or another, the group decides to stay here even though strange things continue to happen during their stay.\n\nWhat follows is for the most part standard slasher fare. Lots of POV shots looking at the cabin from outside, lots of screaming. One thing that was completely out of the ordinary was the order in which characters were killed. As a standard: characters having sex in slasher films are usually offed during, or quickly after the act of coitus (or as Rip says: &quot;coitus interuptus&quot;). When watching this film, I was pleasantly surprised at the level of non-conformity when it came to typical slasher style.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t quite deliver on it&apos;s interesting middle section. Even the subtle references to Argento&apos;s Suspiria can&apos;t quite save it. When it comes down to it, the best film to compare this to would have to be Wes Craven&apos;s The Hills Have Eyes. For one thing: the villains in that film are never really explained. They live in the desert, they inbreed, they eat humans. These things we can take for granted, we can understand this because of how these characters look and talk; they&apos;re complete freaks. In a slight contrast, we never really see too much of the villains in this film. Not until the end, and I was quite confused by the costume designer&apos;s choice. One of the killers in the film is wearing a sweater and polo shirt. And quite strangely, once we see his face, he looks, somewhat normal. It&apos;s not clear why the director never introduces or develops the villains, not that it was needed, but in light of their strange weapon choices and dressing styles, I would&apos;ve been interested.\n\nThe Zero Boys isn&apos;t a typical 80&apos;s teen horror film, and for that it&apos;s a relatively fun, yet somewhat dull film. Recommended viewing with: Night of the Comet, The Hills Have Eyes, Friday the 13th Part III, Chopping Mall.",

      "reviewBody": "This was the first opera turned into a film, and it&apos;s a wild and hilarious experiment - in almost every scene it shines through how the director wallowed in innovations and breakneck experiments - some scenes are absolutely stupendous, like the fighting spree in the night running amok. - This vein of good humor is perfectly matched with Smetana&apos;s equally wildly hilarious opera, and I am sure Smetana himself would have laughed his sides off. At the same time, it pays careful homage to the genuine idylls of the 1850s, the costumes are totally folklore and rustic, the primitivity is consistent and convincing all the way, the horses are for real with actual wild courses with interesting stunts, but above all Max Ophuls&apos; genius shines through the entire production. It does not contain the whole opera of course, you couldn&apos;t do that with the experimental first effort to film an opera, but all the major titbits are there, and you miss nothing of Smetana&apos;s best music, which after all sets the final and definite touch of absolute comedy and high-humoured spirituality to the whole work. - No opera of Smetana&apos;s was more successful, he actually composed ten, and it is still successful yearly at the National Opera of Prague and has remained a stable success world wide on every international scene. Max Ophuls couldn&apos;t have failed in using this for the first opera film, and yet he adds to it, with brilliance.\n\nI must agree, though, with the previous reviewer, that it badly needs some restoration.",

Although I didn&apos;t understand everything - and I surely wasn&apos;t the only one who did so - I think that much of the brilliance of &quot;Hinterholz 8&quot; could have been destroyed by a German version. But now: Why is this film so good? The actors&apos; performance, first of all Roland Düringer&apos;s, is absolutely perfect. The same applies to his script. The overall story of a happy three-person family who ruins itself completely by trying to restore an old house instead of buying a new one is simply the ideal background for this realistic satire on greasy financial advisors, the village people of Austrian hinterland and other characters. The main difference between this film and crap like &quot;Funny Farm&quot; is that the rapid increase of desperation in the husband&apos;s behaviour and the effects on his attitude are presented totally realistically and vividly. Even the surprise ending doesn&apos;t seem fictitious but astonishingly understandable. The only critical remark I want to add is about the son&apos;s Star-Trek-Mania which brought some good jokes at the beginning but became boring and unrealistic in the end. I also think this fantastic film should have gotten a better final scene."

It&apos;s got the cross- country chase, the interesting characters and situation along the way, the innocent hero and the blonde, the oily villain and his crazed henchman, the big ending, (North by Northeast?). \n\nI think it&apos;s a little weak that every nice person- save for the girl, instinctively knows Bob Cummings is innocent the moment they meet him. If you ran into a guy who is accused of torching a defense plant and his best friend with it, who you immediately decide that he&apos;s not so bad? Also the horrendous nature of the accusation would make the `It Happened One Night&apos; type scenes that draw the hero and heroine together rather unlikely. The wartime patriotic speech at the end can certainly be forgiven. What movies in 1942 didn&apos;t have a speech like that?\n\nThe big thing, of course is the ending. Sweet old Norman Lloyd in his younger days finds, as Ben Hecht said, that `he needs a new tailor.&apos; It&apos;s a model for many similar scenes later. One wonders why there was no denouement. Lloyd tells Cummings that he will clear him and then dies. Is Cummings on his way to jail at the end? An earlier scene suggests that the police already on his side. Wouldn&apos;t it be better to make that unclear and then have a scene afterwards where we find out he&apos;s off the hook?"

      "reviewBody": "Ostensibly a film for adolescents, Holes is a film with too much plot and, at two hours long, not enough time to tell it in. Despite that, it is refreshingly original and offers some satisfying performances from both younger and older members of the cast.\n\nStanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) is wrongly convicted of stealing a pair of trainers and sentenced to eighteen months at Camp Green Lake, a boy&apos;s detention centre deep in the desert where he and the other inmates spend each day digging 5ft deep by 5ft wide holes beneath the scorching sun. The camp&apos;s warden (Sigourney Weaver) aided by her henchmen Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) and Dr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) claim such treatment is character building but, of course, have an ulterior motive.\n\nSaddled with a sometimes intrusive and usually inappropriate soundtrack, Holes looks like a music video at times and, because of the wealth of information it has to fit into its running time, contains a convoluted structure featuring repeated flashbacks and, sometimes, even flashbacks within flashbacks. All this suggests a requirement for the viewer to be familiar with screenwriter Louis Sachar&apos;s novel on which it is based, but this isn&apos;t necessarily the case. The film&apos;s story can be followed by anyone who hasn&apos;t read the book, but there&apos;s a depth of characterisation that is sorely missing from the film that anyone who knows the novel would presumably be able to draw on to fill in the gaps.\n\nMost of the real personalities belong to the adult characters. The triumvirate of Weaver, Voight and Nelson stray dangerously close to parody at times but manage somehow to avoid the obvious pitfalls and entertain while giving us reasonably hissable villains. Our young heroes, Stanley and Zero (Khleo Thomas), work well together and writer Sachar builds a largely adversarial relationship between the inmates that would be as recognisable on the school playground as it is in a detention camp.\n\nPerhaps the story&apos;s main failing is the impression it gives of just being too clever. Every story has to tie up its loose ends, but the more strands the story has  and this one has many  the more contrived the ending appears when they are finally all neatly pulled together. But at least it&apos;s different from much of the media offered to teenagers today in that it offers a thoughtful and intelligent story, and it is obvious that both Sachar and director Andrew Davis have put a lot of care and attention to detail into the telling of this tale.",

Some terrible acting by Doyle&apos;s &quot;wife&quot; (Suzanne Kaaaren) when she goes storming into the Bureau&apos;s office and demands action. The usual oat-burner horse chases, as they go after the gang. Filmed at Corriganville... if you haven&apos;t read up on it or visited, it has a fun history, and now its a county park! The actors and director (Sam Newfield) had all started in silents, so they knew the business well enough. Newfield and his brother were the big cheeses at PRC Pictures for a time. The usual western. It&apos;s a very okay shortie, at 53 minutes. It&apos;s exactly what you think its going to be.",

It starts off by creating an eerie atmosphere, offers several paths to take, but then just keeps doing that same attempt to pull you in over and over.. Once you already &quot;pulled&quot; the audience in,, you should then take them on a wild ride forward, not keep repeating the previous premises till it&apos;s monotonous,,.. Anyway, it was okay for a single viewing and I do wish all involved the best of luck on their next adventure...",

Yes, Mary-Kate and Ashley are pretty and perky young girls who have captured the hearts of fans over the years, but as actresses, they still have room to grow.  The plot of Holiday in the Sun is cute, but it follows the same route Passport to Paris, Our Lips Are Sealed, and Winning London took:  they go to a some foreign country, catch up with (and kiss) two cute boys, shop a bit, and solve some mystery.  The plot was cute in Passport to Paris, but now that Mary-Kate and Ashley have grown older, the plot must eventually change."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;In Which We Serve&quot; is more than a story told for propaganda effect about naval heroism and based on Mountbatten&apos;s wartime experiences. As the English film critic Barry Norman has put it: &quot;Aboard Coward&apos;s fictional HMS Torrin there existed forties British society in microcosm. Here everybody knew his place... The one thing they all had in common was the knowledge that each of them, high or low, was expected to show unswerving loyalty and devotion to duty&quot;. The relationships between the men on HMS Torrin and the lives they lead at sea and at home (told through flashbacks) portray a wartime society ordered by class and intentionally defined by the traditional British virtues of duty and sacrifice. It is a society in which understatement and the stiff upper lip reign supreme. Emotions go largely unspoken. They simmer under the surface of the screen in the silences and in the flickering effort of concealment on the faces of the major characters. Personal suffering is borne with quiet forbearance, in the knowledge that it is borne in the service of a higher cause and that to bear it stoically is to set the right example to others. When the ship&apos;s chief petty officer is told of the death of his wife and mother in law in the blitz he first congratulates the sailor who brings him the news for becoming a father before going up on deck to bear his grief alone. The clipped style of speech of Captain Kinross played by Coward himself and the slightly shrill upper class accent of his wife played by Celia Johnson heighten the sense of feelings being stripped away from the words. Their conversation is a caricature of communication - the protagonists performing their dialogue in a choreographed ritual. Real communication is only hinted at - the underlying pain understood but never expressed. In &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; the captain and his wife are the models to which other men and women must aspire - in monologues they define the notions of duty and sacrifice to which each sex is bound. Both put duty before the pursuit of personal happiness (a theme David Lean and Coward return to in Brief Encounter). When the Captain talks of the need for a happy ship he is not referring to the right of individuals expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Here happiness is a collective duty in the interests of efficiency.\n\nFor the men and women in Coward&apos;s vision HMS Torrin is much more than a ship - it is personified as the object of their devotion and jealousy. Above all it is a powerful symbol of the qualities and traditions that unite and must protect their vulnerable island at war. Outdated though this vision may be - part of a world left far behind through post-war socio-economic development and emancipation - it is nevertheless a compelling and entirely consistent vision which ensures the film retains a certain appeal to audiences even today and is a major reason why it can still be so highly rated as a piece of British cinema history."

The lead characters, markedly different women bereaved in the same shooting incident, are well-played and not bad company, and the damsel in distress, as played by Elizabeth Berkley, is someone you want to protect. But far too much of the script seems to have been stenciled from every L.A. noir production ever screened. All the lines we know are coming arrive on schedule, sometimes as part of the action, sometimes within Frances Fisher&apos;s voice-overs. The audience is not much trusted; the film-makers really seem to think it necessary to have Molly explain what a missile is. But this movie does have some brisk action and cool gunplay.",

      "reviewBody": "I hear that this version of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&apos;s isn&apos;t faithful to the original story. Having not read the book (yet!) I can&apos;t say if that&apos;s true or not, but as a film in its own right; this version of Venus in Furs really is something special. Massimo Dallamano is best known to cult film fans for his incredible Giallo What Have They Done to Solange, as well as the less successful follow-up What Have They Done to Our Daughters, although this is a film that is a success for very different reasons. The plot focuses on a nobleman named Severin. He believes that a man is the sum of his childhood traumas; and his childhood, which involved punishments for voyeurism, has lead to him exhibiting some perverted desires. He meets the beautiful Wanda and wants their relationship to exist on a plain where he is dominated by his lover. He begins to ferry her around as her chauffeur and enjoys watching her have sex with other men...but as their relationship continues, he begins to question his own motivations.\n\nVenus in Furs is an incredibly beautiful film. The cinematography is scintillating and this really helps to bring on the story. Lead actress Laura Antonelli is beautiful also and the director uses her and her character well. Régis Vallée is the main standout on the acting front with his understated, yet believable performance as the central perverted character. It&apos;s clear that the film relies on atmosphere more than story and the character&apos;s decisions are what drive the plot forward more than anything else. The film could easily have been turned into a low rent skin flick in the hands of a less talented director; but Dallamano clearly values his subject material and treats it in a respectful manner. The film does manage to justify the lead character&apos;s motivations and while masochism may be an alien concept to some people; the film should be fairly easy to get on with even for someone with no prior knowledge of it. However, this is not a film for everyone and if you like your films plot heavy then Venus in Furs will do nothing for you; but for me, this is a beautiful and memorable film and tracking down a copy is well worth the effort.",

The doctor realising its deadly potential goes on the run studying the parasite so that he can find a way to destroy it.\n\nDirector Charles Band (of the excellent Puppet Master (1989)) offers a plodding film, with the terror scenes few and far between. The small town setting feels like an episode of the Dukes of Hazard, The Fall Guy or the A-Team and sandblasts Mac Ahlberg&apos;s cinematography of any atmosphere. With a Planet of the Ape (1968) vibe Richard Bands music hits all the right notes, along with with some of the parasite effects which notably Stan Winston had a hand in designing and creating.\n\nRobert Glaudini does a great job as Dr. Paul Dean, Demi Moore does her best with the overkill trio of writer&apos;s basic dialogue as Patricia Welles. Band is on a directing high is when he&apos;s borrowing elements from Alien (1979) and an exploding fuel tank from James Bond movies.\n\nMaybe it would have fared better in a Western setting with cowboys instead of gangs and a mad scientist rather than the 80s doubling for the post atomic disaster 1992 with a small town and a fast sleek car.\n\nOverall, fanatical horror B-film fans may get something out of this, even those curious about the handful of effects or Moore&apos;s early role."

      "reviewBody": "Paris 1900: LA BELLE EPOQUE 1900-1914 (1947) chronicles the period between the Paris Exposition of 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 and offers a nonstop stream of silent film footage documenting varied activities, cityscapes and street life in Paris in those years, with the emphasis on leisure activities for the well-to-do. There are quick segments on many subjects, including fashion, sports, women&apos;s liberation, automobiles, aviation, the Eiffel Tower, public parks, theater, painting, music, literature, and labor strife before a 20-minute finale focused on the clouds of war threatening to rain down on a period of unprecedented peace and tranquility in Europe. The film mixes staged footage and scenes from fiction films with news footage (chiefly by Pathé) and early &quot;actualité&quot; film clips. There is a long list of archival sources credited at the beginning of the film.\n\nThere&apos;s an almost stream-of-consciousness quality to the editing as it rapidly goes from one theme to the next with the narration barely keeping pace and sometimes staying out of it entirely. The most illuminating segments, from a historical standpoint, include one on the great flood of 1910 when the Seine River overflowed its banks and threatened to turn Paris into Venice; a treatment of women&apos;s suffrage, including women operating as &quot;cabbies&quot; driving horse-drawn carriages through the streets of Paris; a segment on artists with shots of Auguste Rodin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Claude Monet; and a segment on performers including Maurice Chevalier in a silent comedy, Sarah Bernhardt offstage, Lucien Guitry (father of Sacha, a consultant on this film) performing Moliere, and performers whose names I didn&apos;t recognize doing Oedipus Rex and Hamlet. Other famous people seen in film footage include Enrico Caruso, Buffalo Bill, opera singer Nellie Melba, writer Andre Gide and playwright Edmond Rostand (&quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;). One segment that does not end well shows a tailor described as &quot;a modern Icarus,&quot; rather nervously preparing to jump from the Eiffel Tower to demonstrate his creation, an attachment resembling an automobile air bag and apparently designed to inflate in flight like a parachute.\n\nTowards the end we see a peace conference involving all sorts of world leaders including King Edward VII of England and his nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. American industrialist Andrew Carnegie shows up to put in his bid for peace. The film briefly leaves Paris for glimpses of other countries where turmoil was building, including Austria, Russia, Greece, Turkey, and Portugal. Eventually, when war looks more and more inevitable, we see various armies marching and parading, weapons of destruction being tested, and recruits from colonies in Africa and other regions arriving in France and submitting to drilling and training. \n\nThe version I saw has sardonic English-language narration voiced by actor Monty Woolley (&quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;), who makes it sound consistently witty even when things take a darker turn in the final stretch. The English narration was written by John Mason Brown, who had been a drama critic for the New York Evening Post and then a columnist for Saturday Review. As much as I like Woolley&apos;s narration, I wonder what the original French narration was like and if it gave the film a different overall tone. There is a lively orchestral score by Guy Bernard that accompanies almost the entire film, giving us a nostalgic sense of lost innocence in its main theme and using all sorts of period tunes and well-known cues to bolster individual scenes. Future director Alain Resnais worked on the film in different capacities while Henri Langlois, co-founder of the Cinémathèque Française, served as a consultant. \n\nAn outfit called Grapevine Video sells DVD copies of this film. You can Google them and order through their website."

Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he&apos;s actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a &apos;naughty-list&apos; occupant, who works as a children&apos;s book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor&apos;s edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks&apos; turn in &apos;BIG&apos;) with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa&apos;s Little Helper at Gimbels&apos;who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic, plays &apos;A CHRISTMAS STORY&apos; the elf foreman!"

But the earlier Welcome to\n\nHollywood does an even better job skewering a different side of\n\nHollywood.  Spend a few days following an actor/waiter/bartender around\n\ntown on the circuit of headshots, casting director workshops, agent\n\nsearches, auditions, and bit parts, and you will more deeply appreciate the\n\nbitter sarcasm of this film.   Tony Markes - a former casting director - nails the part of everyman Nick Decker - a talentless wannabe trying not to\n\ndrown in a sea of negativity.  Adam Rifkin nails the role of the name\n\ndirector who would cheerfully dump his friend in a trash bin in order to\n\nadvance his own career.  Together, Markes and Rifkin manage to scam their\n\nway into the Oscars and collect cameos from big-name Hollywood actors\n\nwho clearly think they are talking to the entertainment press, not two guys\n\ntrying to make a movie about Hollywood.  It&apos;s a clever stunt with a clever,\n\nfunny script, and it is right on the money.  Most of the &quot;actors&quot; in this film are real agents, real casting directors, real actors, directors and producers playing themselves.  It&apos;s not a documentary in the strict sense, but it\n\naccurately and gleefully depicts the reality of what goes on in Hollywood. \n\nIf you have any interest in seeing how the process works (or doesn&apos;t), see\n\nthis movie today."

I am not telling you how to feel about anything, I am telling you what you will get. Your reaction to it, is yours and yours alone. For the record, I don&apos;t think those things are funny to be honest. But even if you disagree, the acting on hand here is horrible. Most of the jokes (offensive or not) are lukewarm at best ... for some reason this silliness was something people were crying for ... Sorry that sounded judgy. If you actually like this, good for you. Overall I think this does not live up to any comedy or humor standard. There is not enough suspension of disbelief to make this work ...",

      "reviewBody": "I went to see &quot;We Were Here&quot; today at the Cinéma-Village theater in New York. I was afraid it would disappear before I got the chance to see it. This movie was recommended by a friend who is a producer at KQED in San Francisco as being the ultimate resource on San Francisco during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. Along with Randy Shilts&apos;s seminal book, &quot;And the Band Played on,&quot; he was certainly right.\n\nOne great element of &quot;We Were Here&quot; is that it gives several quite different perspectives on what the HIV epidemic in San Francisco was like at that time: Ed, the misfit who found his place in the gay community by volunteering with people with AIDS early in the epidemic; Daniel, the Jewish artist who felt he had found his true family among San Francisco&apos;s gay men and then lost them all within a few painful years; Paul, the high-profile political activist; Guy, the big-hearted, philosophical black flower vendor; and Eileen, the lesbian nurse who served at ground zero of the epidemic and stuck with it with grit and compassion to the end.\n\nLike Ed, I didn&apos;t fit in well in the &quot;gay community&quot; during my years in San Francisco. So disconnected was I that I did not know a lot of what was happening in the early and mid-1980s, although I remember Guy the florist, who always had a smile for every passerby on the street corner where he worked, and I remember James Harning, a beautiful young man who died a hard death in 1992. &quot;We Were Here&quot; helped me understand much of what was going on all around me in those days. It will do the same for others who weren&apos;t &quot;there,&quot; for reasons of either age or geography, and it will be a moving, bittersweet reminder for those who did survive those difficult years in San Francisco."

      "reviewBody": "Americans have said at gay film festivals that this is the first AIDS musical since &quot;Zero Patience.&quot;  Such comments illustrate the challenge of understanding this complex drama poses to most audiences outside Europe. Away from the continent, few people probably know or care whether Berlin has been the capital of a united Germany for over a decade, or whether there was ever a wall, and so on. It&apos;s useless to expect these audiences to understand the issues and nuances in this film, even the upscale, well-educated (by American standards) film festival crowd I saw the film with.\n\nIt&apos;s great that national cinemas are making films as specific to their cultures as Americans do. Even if this means limiting the box office. US films assume audiences worldwide know American culture (generally true), while US audiences know very little (if anything at all) about other cultures. So, though the opportunity to see a film like ZURUCK... is rare here, it is a banquet for us who are able to understand and savor it.\n\nThis drama is best understood by the European &amp; German gay or alternative lifestyle communities, also by intellectual &quot;Ossies,&quot; and ideally by former East Berlin gay and HIV/AIDS activists. \n\nHaving said that, if you fit the description above; or like two of the film&apos;s main character, you are a foreigner immersed in Berlin&apos;s recent and present position as Europe&apos;s edgiest capital city, this drama is a feast.\n\nThe plot crams in many aspects of contemporary unorthodox Eastern Berlin (Prenzlauer Berg) life: East German nostalgia (its 70s &amp; 80s music, attitude, architecture), the local gay/alternative scene, and Berlin&apos;s cabaret tradition.\n\nBut the film focuses on the deeper issues of living with HIV/AIDS in the present post-antiviral cocktail era, rampant alcoholism among twenty and thirty something young adults, not to mention the fragile and transitory nature of friendships and relationships these days. The latter two are the themes I believe most audiences will identify with. \n\nThe ensemble cast is outstanding, and the film has an unusual gritty realism. Unusual but important problems we are living with are addressed and well explored. This is a feature movie you are likely to see only at a gay film festival if you&apos;re outside Germany. But if the issues interest you, this film is not a bad way to spend 100 minutes.",

I am glad i did. This is an amazing movie that makes you think a lot. This is pure Art and not pretentious or &quot;artsy&quot; at all. A movie with deep meanings. I can&apos;t say it amazed me from the start, but as it progressed, things fell into place and i realized that every word here had a purpose.\n\nLast 40 minutes are heartbreaking and devastating. This monologue (y&apos;all understand when you watch it) was bone chilling. It&apos;s true, every authoritarian regime has exactly the same goal: To make people losing their self respect. That&apos;s the key.\n\nSome times, even &quot;democracies&quot; have the same goal. You can see it everywhere in the world right now.",

      "reviewBody": "It deals with a prospector: Franco Nero who is called back to his hometown when his brother has problems. Tom arrives in Laramie town to learn it is under the control of a poweful owner named Scott , John McDouglas , and his nasty son, Nino Castelnuovo. As townsfolk run with fear when they mistreat and murder anyone who protests their activities. Later on , Tom finds his drunk brother , George Hilton, but things go wrong . They carry their hate in their holsters and a name on every bullet . Both of them take on the sadistic and psychotic Scott Jr , there is nothing between them but hate for each other. When they meet , it is time of massacre .\n\nA thrilling Ravioli Western that displays a story of violence and confrontation, plenty of fights , killing , shootouts , ordinary zooms and impressive finale .Acceptable action scenes with rousing gun-play , and excessive sadism including brutal lashing and crude killings . It stars a big name star cast as Franco Nero as a gunslinger who at the request of an old family friend returns at home and attempts the dangerous Laramie town can rest in order , peace and harmony again ; Nero interpreted a lot of popular and successful westerns , as his first Spaghetti : Tramplers, following Django , Adios Texas, Man pride vengeance , Compañeros , Mercenary , Keoma , Cipolla colt, and in preproduction : Keoma rises and Django lives . Furthermore, the Spaghetti thespian George Hilton who gives one of the best interpretations as a drunkyard in a similar role to Robert Mitchum&apos;s Rio Bravo . Hilton was born on July 16, 1934 in Montevideo , he performed various westerns as My gun can play, Sartana is coming get your coffin ready, Desperadoes, They called him the player with the dead, They call me Hallalujah, The ruthless four, I due figlie di Ringo, Un poker di pistole. Although Hilton also played some successful giallos as Scorpion tale, 7 minutes pour mourir and Strano vizio della signora Ward . Special mention for the greedy and ruthless Nino Castelnuovo who plays a really baddie psycho and murder-crazed . Support cast is frankly good with regular Spaghetti secondaries as Giuseppe Addobbati or John Douglas , John Bartha , Sal Borgese and Tom Felleghi.\n\nIt contains an attractive and catching musical score by Lallo Gori adding two sensitive songs at the beginning and the ending . In addition , atmospheric and adequate cinematography by Riccardo Palottini . The motion picture titled Temps du massacre or The Brute and the Beast , or Concert for a colt , or Le colt cantaron la muerte was competently written and directed by Lucio Fulci . This was first of 5 Westerns that Fulci made , the other 4 were Four of the apocalypse , Sella d&apos;argento, White fang and the return of White fang . Lucio is particularly known for his gory and bloody movies as City of the living dead,NY ripper , The house by the cemetery , Murder rock , The beyond , Un gatto nel cervello, and several others .",

Bette Davis is wonderful as the teacher who unleashes the genius of Morgan Evans, a Welsh mining town&apos;s prodigy. There are so many obstacles that Morgan must overcome, and to see him do this is wonderful.  Every time I watch it I am still amazed at Bessie&apos;s devilishness and I just love the actress&apos;s voice!  It is so interesting.  Everything in this film makes me feel all good inside and no movie collection is complete without it.  The Corn is Green deserves five stars, two thumbs up, and a perfect ten.  Everyone should watch this movie.  It gives you a new perspective on the world, and even on the life of people at one time in history.  I truly love The Corn is Green and if I had not seen it, I would not be who I am today."

It does have formula to it -- such as ending with the big dance -- but it actually has some interesting ideas too. It is about the images that people hide behind, the distortions that they manufacture to escape from painful reality. \n\nOne symbolic scene takes place in a carnival fun house with mirrors that twist and pull reflections into any shape the person wants. This of course is the metaphor for what is happening with all the characters. Another interesting bit of symbolism is the MTV-like video showing the zombie-like behavior of the high school in-crowd compared to images of animals and Nazi rallies.\n\nYes, it&apos;s a teen romantic comedy, but it actually has some real thought in it, and the talented cast play characters that show some depth. The film is a pleasant surprise."

      "reviewBody": "Roberto Mauri directed a number of rather pedestrian Italian western such as Sartana nella Valle degli avvoltoi [1970], Seminò la morte... lo chiamavano Castigo Di Dio [1972], and La Vendetta è il mio perdono [1968] as well as Colorado Charlie [1965], which was his first film in the genre. Unlike Baldenello, Mulargia, and a few other ultra-low budget directors, Mauri didn&apos;t master the technique of focusing his resources to achieve a single effect (like Django il bastard&apos; s [1969] focus on a Gothic atmosphere)and so his movies tend to be a little dull.\n\nWild Bill, sheriff of Springfield and the fastest gun in the territory, is retiring at the request of his new wife, a widow with a young son whose father had been killed in a gunfight. Colorado Charlie, notorious Mexican bandit, learns of this and of the celebrating cattle buyers that have recently returned to town. Waiting for Wild Bill to leave, Charlie robs the buyers and kills the new sheriff, forcing Wild Bill to pursue him. \n\nThis movie is reminiscent of the early WAI which attempted to pass themselves off as American product. While some of these films are descent b-movies, they are not as dynamic and interesting (to most viewers) as later movies that were inspired by Leone&apos;s cinematic and financial success (not necessarily in that order). Colorado Charlie is a strange little melodrama with music that at times brings to mind 1940s b-westerns and histrionics that belong to the silent era. Given the utter poverty of the production, it is difficult to determine the intention of the filmmakers. Was this supposed to be ironic in the manner of the same year&apos;s Una Pistola per Ringo [1965] in which the conventions of the western are played up and almost border slapstick? Was this supposed to be a social melodrama about the consequences of violence like later Spanish westerns such as El Hombre Que mató a Billy el Niño [1967]? This confusion arises from what must have been the mismatch between means and goals as well as shifting goals themselves - melodrama or comedy? Furthermore, Leone&apos;s techniques of extreme closeup and the idiosyncratic use of music were not intuitively understood by many of the filmmakers that tried to replicate his success after the reception of the first two Dollars films. Colroado Charlie was probably intended to be a pastiche or farce of sorts like Navajo Joe [1966], but in the end it doesn&apos;t work.\n\nGiven this, there are the usual WAI motifs of mirrors, assumed identities, and parallels between protagonist and antagonist in which the one is the reverse image of the other. Livio Lorenzo gives one his strange, over-the-top performances(see Jim il primo [1964]) as the title character that may imply some comic intentions  it is hard to tell.\n\nThe ironic pastiche that recurs throughout many of these movies is due to the genuine enthusiasm that the filmmakers had for the American western and the recreation of the conventions and situations of those movies. However, by the mid-60s the conventions of the classic westerns may have appeared absurd. Additionally, the Italian popular filmmakers tended to be very self-conscious and more than a little aware of what might seem like the sarcastic absurdity of their productions shot in the Almerian desert or the Italian countryside. The idea of a Mediterranean western might have struck them as a sort of clever joke. This irony informs the movies of Corbucci, especially Il Grande Silenzio [1968], and it led to the inevitable development of the often unwatchable slapstick westerns of the 1970s. In a film like Colorado Charlie the seeds of this development can be discerned.\n\nThis movie would only be of interest to die-hard euro-western fans.\n\nTop spaghetti western list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907\n\nAverage SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889\n\nFor fanatics only (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849890",

Perhaps some people won&apos;t like it as much as I did, but I had great fun with this film, since there is a very funny gags mixture, where there is something outlandish and nonsensical every 30 seconds, typical of Fesser&apos;s movies. I also have to say that things that look normal in the comics, may seem nonsense in the film, that&apos;s another component that I liked. As I said before, there might be people who don&apos;t like it because it has the humor of &quot;Torrente&quot;, but the film is exceptional, especially because of the visual effects. It is important to point out that the DVD is for sale already, where there are 2 discs with the movie and tons of extra content, so if you liked it you shouldn&apos;t miss it.",

      "name": "A Far Out Document of the late 60&apos;s Encapsulates Counter-Culture America.",
      "reviewBody": "Not many films have documented an era of American culture the way it must have really been. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES captured the reality of the post-war 1940&apos;s. TAXI DRIVER is a masterpiece of social distortion and paranoia exemplary of the 1970&apos;s. No film other than EASY RIDER captures the late 1960&apos;s as seen by the American counter-culture. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper&apos;s story of two men who go in search of America and &apos;freedom&apos; is a bona fide sign of the times. I may not have been around at the time, but it is great to see a film portraying the long-haired, hippie attitude towards an America in turmoil in the form of a biker flick, circa 1969.\n\nEASY RIDER is an exploration of vast and desolate parts of the country. Of course, the stop at Mardi Gras is a necessity, but what Fonda and director Hopper are trying to tell us is that there was no &apos;freedom&apos; as they saw it. The sprawling journey shows filmgoers the multiple frictions and shattered idealism of a generation in the midst of cultural change. Sex, drugs, and music were exploding socially and 1960&apos;s ideology may have come to an end in 1969, literally and figuratively speaking - much like it shockingly does in this film.\n\nPeter Fonda plays cool &quot;Captain America&quot;, otherwise known as Wyatt, while Hopper is a paranoid prophet of the hippies as &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;. The stunning DVD version of the film notes the importance of Laszlo Kovacs, the director of photography. Much of the film consists of Kovacs&apos; simple shooting of the riders as they travel spiraling highways and bigoted backroads. It is some beautiful footage and essential to the trip. A major deal is made, much grass is smoked, and the film takes off from there. Their ultimate goal is never clearly defined, but Fonda&apos;s final comment to Hopper may sum it up for viewers. Did they find what America was supposed to be about? I guess not according to Fonda.\n\nThere is a surreal experience at a commune the Kid and Wyatt stop at. These scenes are out of a Fellini film. One significant shot paints the commune with a 360 degree pan across the faces of the live-in hippies. The expressions on the faces all seem different, some grinning, others just zoned out. Kovac&apos;s amazing camera work (especially on the road with the bikes) along with a virtual who&apos;s who in rock music of the late 60&apos;s makes for a sometimes visceral filmgoing experience. The immortal &apos;Born to be Wild&apos; blares over the opening title sequence and everyone from Hendrix to The Byrds are heard throughout. \n\nEASY RIDER also contains one of Jack Nicholson&apos;s 2 or 3 most memorable performances, even to this day. As drunken lawyer &quot;George Hanson&quot;, he creates an amazingly funny and perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda. He realizes what the general public can think of the &quot;long-hairs&quot; and puts himself in danger just by traveling with them. A bizarre notion of alien presence in the U.S. government is part of a hilarious conversation Nicholson and Hopper have over Whiskey and smoke. His scenes on Fonda&apos;s chopper with the golden football helmet are absolute, cinematic classics. \n\nCredit must be given to Fonda, Hopper, Nicholson, Kovacs, and Terry Southern for giving a new face to movie-making. They captured the era in a raw, jump cutting fashion. Maybe the hippies were not entirely right by trying to live off the land, or smoking dope all the time, but they may have been onto something.\n\nRATING: ***1/2",

      "reviewBody": "Whatever the real total of John Holmes&apos; female sex partners was, it&apos;s got to be a bare minimum of at least 3000. Considering how many films he made and all the action before he was an impotent addict of an X- rated icon, it was an enormous number of women. His claim of 14,000 is somewhat realistic, only if he never got into drugs and did nothing but have sex round the clock!\n\nThe boy born John Curtis Estes was the youngest of four children, grew up in rural Ohio and had by most accounts an unhappy childhood. His namesake (if in surname only) stepfather was a drunk and John as an adult blamed a large portion of his family&apos;s hardships on him. Stepfather number two was a manic depressive who took most of his frustrations out on the now second youngest in the house (John&apos;s half brother David was born several years later) and his physical abuse eventually reached the point where sixteen year old John decided to enlist in the Army.\n\nHowever much of the legends about the first half of his life are concerned, by his early twenties, he&apos;d left the military, moved out to California and met and married straitlaced Sharon. It&apos;s more than fair to assume this lady, who was a nurse by profession and a virgin when they wed, brought him the only real stability he&apos;d ever had. She describes a private, insecure man who had a very low self esteem, before that term was a pop psychology cliché.\n\nThe 8mm loop porn industry in those mid/late 60s era was a fly by night operation, with con artists expecting to pay one with a bum cheque. His first experience with this kind of hustler taught young John to demand payment in cash from then on. He gradually became better known and earned more and more in fees. His endowment is always the matter of speculation, but it&apos;s safe to declare he was at least twice the length of the average North American male.\n\nDirector Bob Chinn wrote the story for &quot;Johnny Wadd&quot; after meeting him and seeing his &quot;credentials&quot; in the flesh. The soon to be series gave Holmes his most famous role ever and the nickname that summed up his anatomy in a rather crude marketing tool. Exhibitors saw the popularity of this new hardcore emphasis on a star system and wanted more &quot;Wadd&quot;.\n\nThe descent into cocaine and all that followed are a matter of disturbing fact now. His posthumously published autobiography &quot;Porn King&quot; is equal parts truth and fantasy. The recent &quot;John Holmes: A Life Measured In Inches&quot; by Jennifer Sugar and Jill Nelson, is a much more grounded in reality explanation of his life from all those who knew him best. \n\nWhat would have happened if John hadn&apos;t gotten messed up on freebase? That&apos;s the unanswerable question. Instead, his life degenerated into full time crime and ever sleazier and dangerous characters as he struggled to maintain his out of control habit. And with the early days of AIDS rearing it&apos;s lethal head, Holmes became the second most notorious figure (after the outed Rock Hudson) to die from AIDS related illness.\n\n&quot;Wadd&quot; gives both the heartfelt testimonial of friends and less than flattering accounts from other associates equal time (my comment for &quot;Wonderland&quot; elaborates on his later years). His life was a sad display of both a lonely, overwhelmed man and the society that could only treat him like some &quot;refugee from a freak show&quot; (Al Goldstein&apos;s words). A must see for those who want to look at the authentic tragedy of drugs and the end results of a career in an essentially insane business. Everyone is dispensable in porn, even the king.",

It was recently released to the video market with Hilary Swank as the marketing hook.  Actually, despite the fact that her picture and name dominate the package, Swank has only two limited appearances in the film.\n\nThe film is a series of chain linked sex vignettes.  Each character has sex with another character and then the second character moves on to the next vignette and has sex with another who moves on to another etc., until finally, the circle is complete and the last character has sex with the first character.  The story has all the substance of a porn movie, with banal, profanity-riddled dialogue serving to bridge the gap between sex scenes.  Since the sex scenes were mostly implied, even the prurient aspect was limited.\n\nHillary Swank plays a hooker on the streets of Hollywood.  She is brash to the point of stupidity, taunting and insulting dangerous people as if she has some sort of death wish.  Her performance here is very amateurish and unpolished.  Natasha Gregson Wagner was the only other cast member worth mentioning.  She gave a reasonably good performance as a woman in an open marriage having sex with one of her husband&apos;s employees (the husband knows).\n\nThere is not really much more to say about this sham.  I rated it a 2/10. Don&apos;t get duped into seeing it as I did just because Swank is on the cover.",

The cinematography is almost like in a documentary, but the performances and narrative is totally abstract and stylized. In my opinion, it succesfully transports the viewer into another reality. It is a film that invites you to meditate and free-associate at your own will. The narrative, linear but disjointed, suggests a breakdown of time itself, a consequence of the lost secret of the glass. The long sections with hypnotizing music and magical landscapes balances well with the rest of the story, and there are scenes were dialogue, visuals and music, creates an incredibly dense atmosphere. There is also a welcome sense of humor which prevents it from becoming overly pretentious. I found it to be a very inspiring and unique movie, and I recommend it to anyone tired of the ordinary."

      "reviewBody": "Unlike a lot of people, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Kickboxers 2 and 3&quot; and think that K3 was better than all of them. However, they should have stopped at 3 and never tried to do another.\n\nThe cast was abominable, with the exception of Brad Thornton as Lando Smith.\n\nKamel Krifa as Tong Po was terrible and his accent even worse. The makeup job they did on him to make him look somewhat Po&apos;ish was terrible at best. Did the make up artists not bother to look at him under the camera lighting or even face to face to see how their makeup job looked?\n\nThe fighting was the only good part about this movie with the exception of the annoying as nails down a chalkboard, Michelle &quot;Mouse&quot; Krasnoo.\n\n I have read that she has won 200 grand first prizes for her martial art and I find that hard to believe unless her competitors were either terrible beyond comprehension, or she had no competition. As a martial artist myself, doing Wah Lum Kung Fu (for those of you not familiar with it, it is the true Kung Fu that they did in China before it was outlawed)and having seen terrible, watered down martial arts from the pathetic &quot;art&quot; they call some forms of Kung Fu that is allowed to be taught in the United States now, (Wah Lum is difficult and taxing at best when done correctly, hence it is not that popular because it actually requires hard work)to musical forms of Karate, I found her forms sloppy, slow and terribly executed. I have seen better from kids in the under 13 divisions at tournaments I have participated in. There is no way she could have beaten any one of those martial artists on even their worst day, as easily as she did, with what she did and the fact that they tried to make it so, was laughable at best.\n\nOther than Michelle&apos;s terrible performance, not only in acting but in her martial forms as well, the rest of the fight scenes were well executed and enjoyable to watch.\n\nI was very disappointed that Sasha Mitchell was not able to showcase more of his fighting. He is an accomplished and highly skilled martial artist and the fact that he was not allowed to show more of what he is capable of, alongside some of the great fighters that were in this movie, was regrettable. \n\nHowever, I still think Sasha Mitchell is far too talented an actor and martial artist to have wasted his time on such a poorly made movie as &quot;Kickboxer 4.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Die Another Day 3½ Stars (Out of Four)\n\nAfter forty years of mostly phenomenal success, the latest James Bond film, Die Another Day, faced a SPECTRE-like challenge to bring something new moving forward, while including essential ingredients from the past. The twentieth official EON-produced James Bond film celebrates its own anniversary with several sly winks to long-time fans of the series, while delivering a solid, if not rollicking, fun adventure in its own right.\n\nSean Connery has said that the role of James Bond should not be underestimated. Pierce Brosnan, to his considerable credit, does not. He is once again perfectly tough, suave, and witty. That he is able to do so seemingly effortlessly may be a double-edged blade, as it is also likely an explanation as to why he is somewhat under-rated in the role.\n\nBrosnan has attempted, throughout his tenure, to explore the inner workings of the James Bond character, and has consistently presented a decidedly more introspective interpretation than any of his predecessors. In this, his fourth 007 adventure, he has combined that with all of the right moves, and it is a fair statement that he has solidified the role as his own. It is certainly a continuation and outgrowth of what he accomplished in the very good The World Is Not Enough (1999), and had hinted at in 1995&apos;s GoldenEye and in the Stoke Poges hotel scene of Tomorrow Never Dies (1997).\n\nThat said, never before have we seen James Bond as we see him in Die Another Day, and by that I am not referring to the Hawaiian shirt or cigar. Brosnan&apos;s tone and straight-forward approach throughout the film is perfect, and the rest of the film follows suit nicely. No tie-straightening scenes here!\n\nThe best James Bond pictures have always followed a formula. One essential component of that formula is that no matter how outlandish the plot, the approach and tone of the film remains serious. So when a mute Korean throws a deadly bowler hat, or a megalomaniacal villain uses a bevy of unsuspecting women armed with cosmetics compacts to carry out his evil plans, or James Bond&apos;s car features an ejector seat and smoke screen, the audience simply is pulled along for the glorious ride. Another component is that the villain and his henchman must be memorable as well as dangerous, no easy task in a series that lists Dr. No, Red Grant, Goldfinger, Odd Job, and Blofeld on its baddie roster. Die Another Day delivers on all these counts.\n\nNeal Purvis and Robert Wade have written a very good screenplay that slyly celebrates the series&apos; anniversary, as well as includes all the essential ingredients of the James Bond films. Most (myself included) would have been satisfied with that, and be done with it. Surprisingly, Die Another Day goes the extra length, and includes some elements as non-formulaic as ever seen in the series. The plot is indeed over-the-top, but one would never know it from observing the characters executing it.\n\nThere are elements that are today very topical, and interestingly, the twisted motivation of the villain Graves includes paternal approval as well as world domination. He rails against &quot;Western hypocrisy&quot; and the British government as &quot;policeman of the world&quot;. He has the chutzpah to parachute into Buckingham Palace.  He reads Sun Tzu. It would not be a cliché to say there is more much more to this guy than meets the eye.\n\nIan Fleming&apos;s novel &quot;Moonraker&quot; serves as a touchstone in many ways for this film, and a great one it is.  James Bond is up against his fellow countryman and universally respected Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens, who delivers a terrific performance). Graves, the mysterious &quot;industrialist&quot;, has developed technology that can be used for human good, or cause great catastrophe. It is up to James Bond to determine which. A nice touch, we even get to see Bond at the private club, &quot;Blades&quot;, where the arrogantly snobbish Graves (shades of Hugo Drax!) is also a world-class fencing champion. This sets up a balls-out match between he and Bond that escalates into a full-scale sword fight. Not once played for a laugh, it is a highlight of the film.\n\nThe pre-credits and credits sequences depict Bond captured by the villain, I mean seriously captured, and tortured and imprisoned for a considerable time. A haggard James Bond is not something the audience is used to seeing, and it is precisely this kind of touch that separate and elevate the last two Bond pictures this close to the level of the series&apos; glory days. (That would be the 1960&apos;s, for those who might consider the arched eyebrow the height of Bondian sophistication.)\n\nDuring the initial sequence, Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) is seen during an intense work out with a kick-boxing bag. After he finishes his vicious session, the bag is opened to reveal an under-achieving underling. Well done! James Bond, under the guise of selling diamonds for weapons, meets up with Moon in North Korea. Bond is ultimately unveiled as a spy, leading to his capture and imprisonment. But not before a kick-ass hovercraft chase, and an especially witty bon mot. (This is also the only scene where James Bond fires a machine-gun, if that matters.) Zao (Rick Yune) is introduced as a worthy physical adversary for Bond. A well known and effective trademark of all the Bond henchmen is some type of physical exaggeration or deformity, and Zao has a personal score to settle with Bond for causing his own.\n\nThis leads right into Danny Kleinman&apos;s credit sequence, and it may just be his best, if not the best of the entire series. That is saying quite a lot considering the great talent and legacy of Maurice Binder. Simultaneously stunningly beautiful and achingly disturbing, this sequence is reason enough to see the film, which I also said of Kleinman&apos;s work in Tomorrow Never Dies. There is also no denying that Madonna&apos;s controversial theme song has a tangible synergy with the credits, and although the song is certainly a departure, I think it will eventually rank with some of the most memorable Bond themes. Overall, the credit sequence is easily one of the highlights of the film.\n\nBond eventually does get out of North Korea, and finds himself in an MI6 hospital, where he encounters a particularly harsh M concerned with what he might have revealed under torture. She rescinds his &quot;00&quot; status, he escapes, and is off to track tracks Zao (and Graves) to Cuba, London (where his licence to kill is reinstated), Iceland, and eventually back to North Korea, where he ultimately confronts Graves. The plot is nicely straightforward, certainly not so unwieldy as to render itself moot, though there are a couple surprises including a traitor within MI6 that make it all the more a satisfying story.\n\nBond meets up with the beautiful Jinx (Halle Berry) in Cuba while posing as an ornithologist named James Bond(!) Beautiful and talented, casting Berry was a major coup, though depicting her in the film as 007&apos;s equal took some of the essential focus from Bond. This is one of my biggest quibbles with the film. The climactic fight scene at the end between Bond and Graves was intercut with Jinx&apos;s own battle. Ironically, I think Jinx&apos;s was superior.\n\nThe rest of the stellar cast includes Rosamund Pike as &quot;Miranda Frost&quot;, and she is a wonderfully pleasant surprise. Judi Dench is as per usual, excellent. Samantha Bond&apos;s &quot;Moneypenny&quot; gets to experience some things we&apos;ve always suspected she has desired, and at least one she probably hasn&apos;t. Toby Stephens is very good as already noted, and Rick Yune is more than memorable as the dangerous and lethal henchman, Zao. Michael Madsen isn&apos;t given much to do, which is unfortunate as he is a great and interesting actor. Nice touch to again include Colin Salmon as Charles Robinson. Madonna&apos;s character is quite unnecessary, although she does get in one good line.\n\nIt has been well publicized that Die Another Day contains many references to previous Bond films. Impressively, none of them seem forced, and several are especially well done.  One needs to pay attention to catch many of these subtle touches, if one is so inclined. (The fan in me was, and loved every one.) They do not take away from the experience of the film, but add to it. Somewhat similarly, an ongoing criticism of the James Bond films has been &quot;blatant product placement.&quot; Even though Die Another Day has one of the biggest marketing campaigns in memory, blatant product placement here is minimal. The Aston-Martin Vanquish gets quite a bit of screen time of course, and the Jaguar XK8 is simply a beautiful car, but besides that, there is but one mention of Bollinger, and just a few unobtrusive shots of well-placed products such as Heineken, Sony, Brioni, and Norelco.\n\n John Cleese as &quot;Q&quot; is inspired casting, and he does the memory of Desmond Llewelyn proud, while still putting his own stamp on the role. The chemistry between Brosnan and Cleese is much more apparent than in The World Is Not Enough, and works as well and is as crisply written as any `Q scene&apos; in the previous films. Bond&apos;s invisible Aston Martin sounds particularly unbelievable, but somehow, Q&apos;s matter-of-fact and simple explanation makes it work. A brilliant moment during one of their scenes, a subtle film reference had me rolling on the floor in laughter, though it has more to do with John Cleese&apos;s history than James Bond&apos;s.\n\nThe very talented David Arnold delivers a wonderfully Bondian musical score, and occasionally includes a subtle homage to John Barry, which is very much in keeping with the tone and celebration of the rest of the film. In addition, I don&apos;t think a James Bond movie has ever included an original song by the original artist to enhance what is depicted on-screen. Nice touch.\n\nNew Zealander Lee Tamahori takes the directorial reins, and his approach suits the film and character well. Incorporating several stylistic techniques (slow-motion, black-and-white, flashbacks) could have been a distraction, but they work, and do provide the film a contemporary feel. The staccato action sequences also reminded me somewhat of Peter Hunt&apos;s editing work from way back when. Tamahori should also be given credit for maintaining the more serious tone of the film. There has not been much continuity with Bond directors since the 1980&apos;s, it would be interesting to see him do another.\n\nCinematographer David Tattersall has assured that the film looks great and Peter Lamont has again delivered some beautiful sets. The car chase on ice, &quot;Blades&quot; and the Ice Palace are especially memorable. Though most everything looks marvelous, Die Another Day contains a surprising amount of CGI in its second hour. My biggest criticism about the film is its over-reliance on that arcade-game look and feel at times. I would add, a scene where a CGI Bond is &quot;surfing&quot; while holding onto parachutes is a pale reminiscence of a far more exciting scene from earlier in the film which was physically shot in Maui.  What is the logical extension of using extensive CGI, an animated Bond film? The films have sometimes been described as &quot;cartoonish&quot;. I trust the producers do not interpret that as a preference.\n\nBut these are relatively minor quibbles.  Overall, Die Another Day works exceedingly well, and is superb entertainment that will also please the long-time fan of the series.\n\nFinally, it might be said that Gustav Graves has no advantage over M and James Bond when it comes to understanding Sun Tzu and his &quot;The Art of War&quot;: &quot;It is the wise general who uses the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby achieves great results.&quot;\n\n Great results indeed. Well done, 007"

      "name": "A solid, enjoyable film whose pace covers it despite plot holes  the heavy cast also make it worth seeing",
      "reviewBody": "During a high level executive meeting between a Japanese corporation and an US weapons contractor a young woman is found murdered. Due to his connections Captain John Connor is sent to lead the investigation with Lt Web Smith. The investigation is immediately hindered by the Japanese culture, the shadowy business figures and political pressures, however before long Connor and Smith are presented with a cctv disk that shows the murder being carried out by a known suspect. When the suspect dies in a chase the investigation seems over but a closer investigation of the evidence shows that the case is far from closed.\n\nNot being a real big fan of Michael Crichton, I wasn&apos;t sure how I&apos;d like this film  I&apos;m not a big traveler and don&apos;t buy my books in the airport when I do travel! It was apt then, that I wasn&apos;t overly taken by the plot here and felt that its pace was more responsible for it being an enjoyable thriller than any great skill in the writing. In its essence the glossy story takes in technology, big business, Japanese cool and political goings-on  all these and other things combining to mean that it moves well and is consistently busy. This is not to suggest that it all fits together because it doesn&apos;t; the plot has holes and lose strands within it that distract if you think too much about it  happily its pace and revelations did not give me too long to linger over these and I managed to enjoy it, the problems being forgotten in all the gloss.\n\nOn top of this gloss is piled a cast that is worth seeing no matter what they are doing together, and their presence and ability further cover for a plot that doesn&apos;t always serve its many characters as well as they deserve. Connery has fun in the sort of role he seems to greatly favour now  distinguished, wise men of age who can still dish it out if need be. He is easy to watch and only at times does he feel like he&apos;s forcing it (like when he suddenly shouts). Snipes does not look as confident but that may be because his &apos;look&apos; has dated here and changed since 1993. However he is still good and has his moments despite being given a rather secondary role to Connery&apos;s. It the support cast that surprised me though  so many well known faces in supporting or minor roles. Keitel is very good, playing an interesting character that goes nowhere but is still interesting and well delivered; Tagawa is gifted a fuller role than he often gets and does well with it. Wise is OK but he forces it and didn&apos;t convince me as much as I would have liked  still did the job asked of him though. People like Mako, Carrere, von Bargen and Buscemi all add depth and make the film feel fuller than it is even with some small (and perhaps unnecessary?) characters.\n\nOverall this is a slick and enjoyable film even if it is as much style and pace as it is substance. The plot doesn&apos;t totally fit together but its mix of techno-conspiracy, political plotting, sex and intrigue all keep it moving along enjoyably enough and the impressive and rather charismatic cast only help to make it feel all the slicker. Worth a watch even if some may find it a little inconsequential in regards some bits of plotting."

      "reviewBody": "I will give some credit to this otherwise awful film, that it is better than its abysmal sequel Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. On paper, it doesn&apos;t look so bad, it has a great cast including beautiful Kathaleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd who is a lot of fun in pretty much everything he&apos;s in and the late Dom DeLuise. If only, if only it had a decent enough script and a good enough plot. However, the film is severely lacking in both areas, and makes a waste of those truly talented actors.\n\nThe script is just awful, and doesn&apos;t give anyone enough to work with, and there is no originality or sophistication. The story is one that has been done before and better about a nasty children&apos;s magnate who is carrying out tests on a host of brainy little children on the premise that they can speak in a secret language. Bob Clark&apos;s direction is very unfocused throughout, and doesn&apos;t improve whatsoever. The camera-work is rushed, and the slapstick is uninspiredly staged. In fact, if there was a redeeming quality, the soundtrack was okay to say the least.\n\nThe performances are disappointingly poor, and they are not helped by the lacklustre direction and the witless script. To be honest I found triplets Leo, Myles and Gerry Fitzgerald very irritating as the twins who try to outmatch Dr Kinder. As for Turner, this has to be a career low for her. This is a shame, because she is so beautiful and talented, but her strengths aren&apos;t even put to use here and she does overact quite wildly. Christopher Lloyd usually excels in roles similar to the one he has here, but he looks embarrassed here and looks as though he wants to get it all out of the way. And Dom DeLuise? For such a talented and versatile actor like DeLuise, you would expect a lot from him. But his part is so badly underwritten that he comes across as wasted.\n\nAll in all, sorry but I didn&apos;t like this movie. Even with such a wonderful bunch of actors, their talents are all gone to waste with poor writing, direction and plot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

It was the relatively high review score that prompted me to &quot;break my duck&quot; (it&apos;s a UK expression) because I simply can&apos;t believe how this film has got such good reviews. It has the most outrageously over the top acting and ridiculous script that I have seen in such a long time.\n\nPerversely, it&apos;s the absurdity that is the only thing line that keeps it from being boring and predictable - you are weirdly compelled to see how silly it can get. Every single character&apos;s handling of the situation and dialogue is so unbelievable that it&apos;s almost funny . If you thought that Nick Cage was bad in the ridiculous &quot;Wicker Man&quot; remake then this is certainly a close second.\n\nOne reviewer called this film &quot;subtle&quot; and I respect all views, but I found this as subtle as a flying mallet. This is sub standard fare even for the limited acting range of Nick Cage, but Nicole Kidman is sadly wasted here and is capable of so much more.\n\nSometimes &quot;over the top&quot; can make for entertaining escapism, not here. Sorry, I know it different strokes etc, but I thought this was absolutely awful."

      "reviewBody": "Of the top 6 reviews I currently see here, 3 are slamming Jennifer Jones for being too old, 1 is slamming producer David Selznick for being in the decline of his career, 1 is whining that it&apos;s not like the book, and 1 is slamming writer Hemingway for not doing any fighting in the war (Um... he was an ambulance driver).\n\nWhile this film may not deserve an Academy award for best picture, it certainly deserves a decent review on IMDb dedicated to the film itself. So here goes my attempt.\n\n&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is a lavish production of a love story set against the backdrop of World War I. In that respect it&apos;s in the same genre as other classic war romances &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Platoon &quot;. Haha just checking to see if you&apos;re paying attention. Everyone knows &quot;Casablanca&quot; was not set in a war but an occupation.\n\nWhere &quot;Farewell&quot; differs from these other classics is in the distribution of war &amp; romance. &quot;Farewell&quot; features far more battle scenes (4) compared to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (zero) and &quot;Casablanca&quot; (zero). The result may be a bit disappointing in the romance department, and several reviewers (as well as the New York Times review on the film&apos;s release) have complained about the &quot;lack of chemistry&quot; between the two leads. I think this perception is simply due to the fact that less time is spent setting up the romance, putting more of a burden on the viewer to accept a relationship that simply happens. Viewers may also feel romantically cheated because this is not a traditional romance between two traditional individuals who dream of immediately getting married and having kids and a dog. But in fact this purposely informal, slightly dysfunctional romance is what ultimately made it interesting to me because it marked a change of formula in the age-old Hollywood romance.\n\nIf you see this movie, pay close attention to Jennifer Jones&apos; excellent portrayal of a reluctant lover who is perhaps suffering from too many demons to actually fall in love completely, the way she wants to. She is riddled with insecurities, conflicts and possibly guilt, making her like the the stereotypical guy who can&apos;t commit. Meanwhile Rock Hudson plays a character more like the stereotypical lovesick schoolgirl. If you enjoy stereotype reversals like this, you&apos;ll definitely find yourself interested in their &quot;lack of chemistry&quot;.\n\nWas Jennifer Jones too old (late 30s) to play the role of Katherine as Hemingway had intended her (early 20s)? Probably. Did Jennifer get the part because she was married to producer Selznick? Absolutely. Does any of this make her a bad actress? No way. Short of Vivien Leigh, I think she was the best person to play the role as she did: the troubled lover whose cynical, morbid thoughts were always brewing not far away, despite her outwardly cheerful appearance. Actually I take back the thing about Vivien Leigh being better; the more I think about it, Jennifer was ideal for this sort of character.\n\nA subplot involving Vittorio de Sica&apos;s war-weary character descending into madness is sure to catch your attention. It was actually my favorite part of the movie, and I wish they had spent more time on this complex character shift as well as his interesting polite antagonism of the church (with a spectacular short speech he says to the priest near the end). But alas, with the romance and the battle scenes already vying for screen time, Vittorio&apos;s story only got 2 or 3 dedicated scenes. They were powerful nonetheless.\n\nYes, as others mentioned, the ending seemed abrupt. But after thinking about it, I think it was perfectly in line with some of the interesting &amp; unusual themes that the story set up. In short, this is not a straightforward soldier-meets-girl love story. The conflicts that are presented (particularly in Jennifer Jones&apos; mysteriously troubled psyche) make this romance much more than meets the eye. If you enjoy wartime romances that are not always formulaic love stories (i.e. they may contain hidden dysfunctional surprises), check this one out.",

Story: Asal is a story of feud between three brothers over property; two brothers (Sampath Kumar and Rajeev Krishna) on one side with their avarice for all the wealth with the righteous third trying to stop the family from breaking down. No marks for guessing who is the righteous one, who else but Ajith Kumar?! The feud that exists as an undercurrent in the presence of their father (Ajith again) turns ugly and personal after he passes away. It grows bigger with the two brothers joining in to elbow out Ajith. He graciously steps aside, only wanting to keep cordial relations. But, the two brothers are just not able to handle the huge wealth and the responsibility that it brings. Their wealth attracts trouble and it is up to Ajith to come back and save his brothers. Do things end there or does the feud continue, does wealth disintegrate the family and how does Ajith conquer all the odds? Watch Asal to find out.\n\nVerdict: This Asal will gain no great interest",

It&apos;s funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that&apos;s becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe&apos;s long history, it&apos;s clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced.",

Student teaching was one of the best things I ever did in my life because I got to learn even more and it was more visual and personal. A few things for people who saw this film and don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about when I say &quot;unrealistic&quot;, number one rule of teaching is that you do not become that personal with students, such as inviting them to stay in your house because you feel that they are in danger. Michelle would have been fired on the spot for several things she did in the film.\n\nBut still, I really liked Dangerous Minds. It really touched my heart, because I felt for Michelle&apos;s character. How hard it is to want to get into a student&apos;s life, but you can&apos;t because otherwise, you have stepped out of line. She was above the system and was truly a good person who wanted to just help her students. I loved it&apos;s message of how a person can either choose to stay down or hold their head high. I would recommend this movie, it&apos;s a tear jerker, but a decent flick and much better than today&apos;s movies.\n\n7/10",

With films such as &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;, &quot;Solaris&quot;, &quot;Mirror&quot;, Stalker&quot; and &quot;Nostalghia&quot;, Tarkovsky enriched the world with powerful works for art. &quot;Sacrifice&quot; was his final film, made while Tarkovsky was dying of cancer. The story concerns an elderly academic who lives with his family in a rural part of Sweden. When he learns that about an imminent nuclear war, he makes a desperate pact with God. The film is astonishingly beautiful, like all Tarkovsky&apos;s films. Images of nature, water and fire feature prominently, as does the shifting from colour images to black and white.\n\nIt is important to remember that Tarkovsky is not a very accessible film-maker, and his films make great demands on viewer&apos;s patience and attention, but if you are willing to make the effort you will be rewarded by an unforgettable experience.",

I never even knew about this film until i saw it round a mate&apos;s house.\n\nI watched it thinking is was one of those early cheese flicks that were around during the 80&apos;s, after Sly success with Rocky and before his success with Rambo. Happily i was wrong, this was hilarious.\n\nThe story is well done and one that was entertaining. I was expecting to fall asleep during this film but i stayed awake the whole time and didn&apos;t yawn once. Sly looked well out of place in this picture but that was the whole idea and he does it brilliantly, playing a New York Cabbie who don&apos;t know the first thing about country music. And when he sang during the first half of the movie it was in stitches. He was excruciatingly awful,and I was literally crying laughter. However when he did sing with the lovely Dolly Parton, he was good. This film is kind of like Rocky meets Nashville with a great performance from everyone involved.\n\nRhinestone is one of those gems of a movie that is a classic later on in it&apos;s years. This is Sly at his comedy best,he don&apos;t play it for laughs he is just himself (so to speak). Forget Stop or my mom will shoot or Oscar, this is Sly at his comedy best. he can do comedy and it shows right here.\n\nI dare you not to be tapping your foot by the end. This will go with my Good Sylvester Stallone films.",

      "reviewBody": "I first noticed the lovely &quot;Linda Day George&quot; in &quot;Pieces&quot; where she made bad-horror-movie history by screaming &quot;BASTARRRRDS!&quot; three times in a row to riotous effect. She&apos;s not as overtly hilarious here (in fact, it appears she was probably a decent actor, generally) but she&apos;s really the only reason I could recommend this relatively average flick. She rolls her eyes, runs around with an over-sized finger (don&apos;t ask!) and, while possessed, does some seductive things. I knew it would be a fun movie during a scene early on where she walked around her apartment, anxious about the rain outside, then finally threw her things down and yelled, &quot;DAMN!&quot; with what seemed like every emotive power she ever learned in acting school! Strassberg would&apos;ve been proud. And I can&apos;t look away! Linda had some great moments later too, but that single moment was the most (unintentionally) funny.\n\nAnother nice surprise, during the opening credits I heard this overwrought, sweeping score with lots of strings and lots of starts-and-stops...I thought, &quot;My this sounds like Pino Donaggio!&quot; And it turned out it was! Another satisfying score from the almost-always dependable Pino, who appears to be the busiest composer in history. Most of his usual touches are here--great chase music, an achingly beautiful &quot;love theme&quot; and a finale that leaves you feeling somehow sentimental even if the movie was total crap.\n\nWhich this one pretty much was. John Saxon is great--especially kicking ass and going, &quot;Stay!&quot; to a would be attacker. He&apos;s cool and this film didn&apos;t hurt him a bit, thankfully. Otherwise there&apos;s not much here in this &quot;would-be&quot; giallo: **a crossed-eyed ghost woman with green laser eyes **no sex and minimal gore, although what there is was pleasantly repulsive **terrible effects **slow pace **sloppy editing **plots stolen from &quot;Amityville,&quot; &quot;Exorcist,&quot; &quot;Beyond The Door&quot; and especially &quot;Suspiria,&quot; and **no surprises, really. It DOES have some hilariously bad deaths though, if you&apos;re in the mood, which I usually am, and if you can stay awake. The death of a guy in a &quot;posessed&quot; car that&apos;s barely moving is not to be missed--especially when he spontaneously explodes into fire, but continues to scream! I don&apos;t know who Herb Freed was or why he was making cheap horror movies, but this is not the WORST movie ever. Keep the fast-forward button handy and this is an enjoyable piece of mind-sludge."

      "reviewBody": "... For Best Picture Oscar winner you have &quot;Sound of Music&quot; in 1965 and this film in 1966, turning to the more controversial (for its time) &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; in 1967 and then back to innocent musical storytelling with Oliver! In 1968 and then back to controversy with &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; in 1969, even rated X at the time. Amidst this change was &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;, ironically about the importance of holding fast to your ethics in spite of changing times.\n\nThe Tudor dynasty of England was an interesting 120 years or so. This film focuses on the very brief time that Henry VIII was fighting the Roman Catholic Church over him marrying a second wife after the same church had made a special dispensation for him to marry the first, with that first wife now past the age of childbearing and no surviving son resulting from the marriage.\n\nInto the fray comes Sir Thomas More, a devout Catholic. This film distills More&apos;s viewpoints down to his refusal to recognize that Henry has any right to break off from Rome and declare himself supreme head of the church in England. More seemed willing to help with arguments made to Rome in favor of granting Henry a divorce from his first wife, Katharine of Aragon, but he would not go past that into the taking of church property as Woolsey suggested or into the complete break from Rome that Henry eventually made. More was willing to help Henry as far as &quot;working within the system&quot;, but he believed that system - the Roman Catholic Church - was established by God and he would not support an alternative view.\n\nMore remained silent on the issue of what Henry was doing, thinking this would protect him. He even remains silent to the viewer, since he refuses to share his opinion with anyone, though one can surmise it from what he has said he will not do or swear to and the resignation of his office of chancellor.\n\nThe real irony is everybody wondering at More&apos;s caution proclaiming - &quot;This isn&apos;t Spain, it&apos;s England!&quot;, with everyone being so sure of their civil liberties there. Yet Thomas Cromwell was executed by Henry in 1540 for pretty much facilitating his marriage to an unattractive woman (Anne of Cleves), Anne Boleyn was executed on trumped up charges of adultery because she too failed to produce a male heir and a second divorce would have just been embarrassing, and the Duke of Norfolk only escaped execution because Henry died the night before Norfolk&apos;s scheduled execution. So it turned out that in Tudor England, dying in bed could be a goal difficult to attain in spite of it not being Spain.\n\nIn the end, More was executed because of the lies of RIchard Rich, as depicted in the film. More had this guy&apos;s number from the beginning. Before his fall from grace, More had urged Rich to take a teaching job and not press his luck at court because of his weakness of character and thus his susceptibility to being bribed and tempted. And yet it was the morally weak and treacherous Rich who eventually ascended to the office of chancellor, lived past the age of 70, and died in bed of natural causes.\n\nThe strength of this film lies in its performances - Scofield&apos;s steadfastly loyal and honest Thomas More, Robert Shaw as the bombastic and big as life Henry VIII, Susannah York as More&apos;s well educated and wise daughter, and especially an almost unrecognizable John Hurt as the slimy little weasel Richard Rich. My apology to weasels everywhere.\n\nIt is intensely political and philosophical and really appeals to people who think about standing up for one&apos;s ideals even when it is very easy to allow ethics to be bent.",

He hasn&apos;t done bad though, except some poor English dialogs :-) Really hoped someone else was the director, say Joshi. The role of Kaviyoor Ponnamma and related scenes really bulges out of the theme and looks like a desperate attempt to lure the other gender audience.

As the story progressed, I was enamored by the brilliant execution of story within story within story.  The world needs more films like this, with semi-unfamiliar faces who don&apos;t need to work so hard convincing us that they are indeed this character they portray.  This is one of those films people will still be talking about in 25 years; a monumental masterpiece that broke the grounds in straightforward plot-telling!!"

I also gained real insight into the kind of life these boys and young men lead as part of a boarding school,...and one of the best choirs in the world.\n\nI think the film-makers did a great job of showing the hard work, passion and occasionally, tears that are part of the extraordinary commitment these boys and their families make, and the musical parts of the film are, at times, truly breath-taking. I found myself wishing they could be longer! \n\nIt&apos;s a beautiful film to look at, too. The churches, concert halls, cities and other locations are the &apos;guest stars&apos;, but the &apos;Thomaner&apos; themselves really steal this show.\n\nWell worth seeing, and not just for Bach fans. I saw it in German, but I hope the DVD version has subtitles - this film deserves a wider audience.",

In some ways, it is, and in other ways it is not.\n\nYou have to give this film credit.

      "reviewBody": "BA:BO is a 2008 film based closely on a popular webcomic by Kang Full. While the film does contain some comedy, it tells a much deeper story than any of Cha Tae-hyun&apos;s other films. I would even say that the film is purely an emotional drama with only mere hints of romance and slight humor. In BA:BO, Ji-ho (Ha Ji-won) returns home after studying and playing the piano in Europe for over ten years. She left Europe because of the frustration that came with an instance of stage fright. Back in her hometown, she meets her mentally challenged, childhood friend, Seung-ryong (Cha Tae-hyun), who runs a small toast shop in order to take care of his younger sister, Ji-in (Park Ha-sun), who unfortunately despises him. Along with Seung-ryong&apos;s best friend, Sang-soo (Park Hee- soon), and Hee-yeong (Park Grina), the characters all suffer life problems of their own. It is the village idiot, Seung-ryong, who heals and saves them all.\n\nJi-ho and Sang-soo&apos;s interaction with Seung-ryong evokes pity and nostalgic sympathy. Due to a misunderstanding, Sang-soo&apos;s guilt as a child drew him close to Seung-ryong as a true friend. Ji-ho on the other hand, was admired by Seung-ryong ever since they were little due to her piano playing that, according to Seung-ryong, would cause snow to fall and stars to appear. It is sweet and a bit sad to see Ha Ji-won&apos;s character treat Seung-ryong so nicely because of his innocent mind. While he genuinely likes her, she finds comfort and strength when she looks after him. The film tells a story that really can only be fully understood by reading the expressions and actions of the actors. And it is those actions that can cause the viewer to get a bit teary eyed here and there throughout the film.\n\nSpeaking of actors, Cha Tae-hyun plays his role as the hardworking, village idiot so convincingly. And he does so with his own style – his signature goofy smile adds so much authenticity to his character&apos;s innocence. He really is one of the best actors in Korea. Ha Ji-won impressed me as well, considering that this is one of her first works that I&apos;ve seen where she isn&apos;t type-casted as a cutesy love interest. The slight, emotional changes that her character experiences can be seen thanks to her superb acting, despite the limits that the script has for her character. All the other actors were great as well, besides Park Ha- sun in one scene towards the end of the film – while the scene evokes grievous emotion, it appears questionably forced.\n\nIt is fascinating how the individual stories of each character seem separate, but all converge in the end. And it is that result that really makes the viewer sit back and think how people, no matter how smart or talented, can affect the lives and happiness of those nearby. BA:BO is a touching film that stays with the viewer well after the ending credits. I highly recommend giving it a watch, especially if you&apos;re a fan of Korean dramas.",

I would like to have seen more made of the kids codebreaking, they could really have milked that and didn&apos;t, the opening scene was just to cliché in setting up Willis&apos;s character as were the characters of his big black boss and hard nosed chief. The very last scene was typical US syrup but was thankfully very short.\n\nWhat was good? everything else, I loved the idea behind the story, Miko Hughes is totally amazing to the point I had to check the next day to find out how the hell they managed to get a autistic kid to act (is isn&apos;t autistic but is a damn fine actor), Willis really does add vulnerability to a role that he has played many times before, with the movie underpinned fantastically with a John Barry soundscore and Harold Becker carefully crafts what for me was a very enjoyable movie watching experience and stands head and shoulders above many I have seen recently. 3/5 for me",

      "reviewBody": "The first major family flick of the holidays, this Avengers-for-children boasts the most epic line-up of characters you&apos;re likely to see this Summer: Santa (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Jack Frost (Chris Pine) and the dream-making Sandman going up against fear himself, Pitch Black (Jude Law). It&apos;s a neat concept to begin with, but Dreamworks amps up the fun by contorting our preconceptions of these icons – especially the Easter Bunny, here played as an ocker warrior – and delivering the goods in humour, emotion and action. It goes a moralistic touch too far on occasion, and the story is certainly predictable, but the overwhelming sense of giddy excitement running through the movie&apos;s veins outweighs any plot contrivances or missteps that occur. A sweet start to the festive season for kids of all ages – including those in adulthood.",

Had big shoes to fill, and it didn&apos;t manage it.\n\nIt tells the story of our heroes venturing from the arcade to the internet to save one of their games and *Sigh* does a plot really matter here? Ultimately that&apos;s not what its about.\n\nFull of goofy humor, the occasional adult-ish joke to keep the parents happy and lots and lots of product placement. A lot of people looking at the reviews clearly have issue with this but truth be told it would have been very difficult to show the internet in that fashion without showing off the big names. I&apos;m sure a lot of money passed hands because of this, but I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s such an issue.\n\nThe voice cast once again are fantastic including newcomers such as Gal Gadot. The trailers &quot;Princesses&quot; weren&apos;t as obnoxious as I expected and quite frankly the whole thing is passable enough stuff but nothing more than that. Somehow a lot of the original charm seems to be missing, the novelty value has diminished and the whole thing felt more like a cashgrab than a loyal sequel.\n\nThat being said Ralph Breaks the Internet isn&apos;t bad, it&apos;s just not living up to expectations.\n\nThe Good:\n\nExcellent voice talent\n\nA couple of nice ideas\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPales in comparison to the first\n\nLacks charm\n\nThe satire really spotlights how pathetic much of the internet community are with &quot;Trends&quot; and viewing habits.",

Unfortunately for Joe, the agent acted too fast and, had he waited he would have seen Joe recover the crashing aircraft and make it away safely. Problem is in the time taken to sort this out (which has involved top agent Mr Jordan), Joe&apos;s earthly remains have been cremated with no chance of him just being returned to his body. So begins a search for another body for Joe, a search that ultimately leads to millionaire Farnsworth  who has just been murdered by his wife and her lover.\n\nLooking at the basic plot (and even the detail of the ending) it does strike me as rather amazing that this did get made as a studio picture because it does have a dark streak to it that could easily have undercut any comedy, whimsy or romance and alienated the audience. Watching it again recently it does still surprise me that it pulls it off but somehow it is light, funny and with plenty of charm and somehow even the rather ambiguous ending comes off as lifting and happy. A big part of this for me is the cast because they get the delivery just right  in particular Robert Montgomery. Some have said that Rains dominates his scenes but I totally disagree, Montgomery owns the film because the tough but kind nature of his character is the engine that drives it to success. He is note perfect and his performance kept me with the tone of the film. Rains is nearly as good but is more of a cool presence in each scene.\n\nHall&apos;s direction holds it together and makes the tone so that we never lose the slight hint of darkness but prevents it ever getting in the way of the comedy and fantasy of the piece. Here Comes Mr Jordan has been remade several times recently and you can see why because this original is charming and fresh with solid comedy and whimsy held together by a couple of great performances."

The quick cuts where so spot on and well paced. And the trick shots where like something from a poetic avant garde film. There was also a very nice close up of eyes, which reminded me of the Spaghetti Westerns.\n\nThe story is not bad. Reminded me a little of D.W. Griffith mellow drama. The acting is also not too bad but the strength of this film is first and foremost its visual aspect, something sadly lacking in his other silent films I have seen.",

Serious continuity errors (like band aid that somehow appears on colonel&apos;s face) and locations that make no sense (e.g. parking lot of the most ugly building in Warsaw aka Palace of Culture that supposedly is court building or whatever director/screen writer imagined).\n\nDedication to Kieślowski is a very sour joke. At least Kieślowski had enough self-esteem to hire others to write his screenplays. Mr. Stuhr is a very good actor and he should remain one.\n\nWorst of all: this movie is boring. One can not figure out why the same actor is playing four different people. I still wonder why some good actors, like Ms. Ostałowska, decided to take part in this production.\n\nYou can forget renting this movie. No loss: save 87 minutes of your life.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the awkward title, HE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU (1977) is a real find for kung fu fans, featuring expert performances and fight choreography, ample humor, and lots of kung fu in its 90-minute running time. Shot on a low budget on Hong Kong locations, it tells a clever story and features a pair of intriguing lead characters. Wong Yue (not to be confused with Jimmy Wang Yu) plays a con man and pickpocket who constantly runs afoul of the cops and local gangsters. He then finds an amnesiac (played by Gordon Liu), who displays advanced kung fu skills when attacked, and uses him to get back some money cheated out of him by a local casino. The two go on to rob the local crime boss of two bags of money and the amnesiac insists on distributing the cash to victims of the boss. The amnesiac, who teaches his shady partner his kung fu moves, turns out to be the missing son of an Admiral who comes to town looking for his son. Eventually, the corruption is exposed, the son gets his memory back, and the two heroes fight off all the gangsters.\n\nThere are many kung fu fights in the film and all are worked seamlessly into the narrative. There is an attractive and saucy female character, Miss Ho (played by Li Ying), a restaurant owner who is harassed by the gangsters and rescued on more than one occasion by Wong Yue. Gordon Liu and Wong Yue also co-starred in Liu Chia Liang&apos;s classic, DIRTY HO (1979), and display great chemistry together. Wong Yue not only fights well, but is a superb comic actor in both films as well.\n\nHE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU was ably directed by Liang&apos;s brother, Liu Chia Yung (aka Lau Kar Wing), who has a small part as the Admiral&apos;s assistant. The final battle between Gordon and the gangsters, taking place throughout the full length of an abandoned building and atop its shingled, slanted rooftop, is particularly ingenious. Many familiar kung fu faces dot the cast, including Lam Ching Ying, Lee Hoi San, and Meng Hoi as gang henchmen. The only annoying aspect of the film is the frequent playing on the soundtrack of a `comical&apos; guitar riff employing the `Dixie&apos; melody. Aside from that, this is a must-see for kung fu fans."

The chemistry between them is mostly believable. I liked James Wood&apos;s smarmy, pompous, character. Alex Karras seemed miscast, as did Richard Widmark. The story piles on a thickening plot that occasionally wanders off course, and is probably more complex than necessary. No police are involved, and bodies too conveniently disappear. The ending seems especially forced, with an outcome that is less than satisfying.\n\nThe film is beautiful, however the characters are mostly unlikeable, including Rachel Ward&apos;s. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this partially flawed movie. - MERK",

When the thugs lead by the psychotic Toecutter kill Max&apos;s wife and baby, our hero is livid with vengeance. Armed with his armor-plated muscle car and a sawed-off shotgun, Max wreaks turbo-powered revenge on the murderous punks.\n\nThough a bit dated compared with the action films we have today, &quot;Mad Max&quot; still stands out as a very impressive movie. For one thing, this film had a tiny budget. Well, as proven in &quot;El Mariachi,&quot; a movie doesn&apos;t need a $1 million budget if you have a creative story and imagination. &quot;Mad Max&quot; stands out as a classic low-budget flick that made it big without the intense u"

Dont see any negative aspects of it. I recommend it to action comedy fans who are in desire to see an old school movie..."

At first everything seems a bit messy (various threads seemingly insignificant) but then the plot gets poignant though a little oppressive. Acting performances are affecting and strong (especially Charlize Theron), the tone is progressively melodramatic. It&apos;s undeniable that The Burning Plain possesses the style of a strong drama, never run-of-the-mill and with an emotional resonance resembling 21 Grams. Overall a very good sad film, with a finale that strikes a lot.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Dead Space&quot;, is considered as one of the greatest video game&apos;s ever made. It was both scary and fun. Upon it&apos;s release, not only a comic-book series was made, but a Direct-To-Video animated prequel was released.\n\nThe thing&apos;s I liked about this movie was the animation was great, I liked how they kept the monster&apos;s from the video game in the movie, and I liked the story.\n\nThe thing&apos;s I didn&apos;t like about this movie is that the character&apos;s were flat and the acting was mediocre. With the exception of Jim Cummings as The Captain and Kevin Michael Richards as Samuel Irons.\n\nOverall, &quot;Dead Space: Downfall&quot;, is a decent prequel that&apos;s still worth watching only if you&apos;re a fan of the game. If not, then this film is not for you.",

      "reviewBody": "BOXER FROM SHANTUNG (aka KILLER FROM SHANTUNG, 1972) successfully combines gangster and kung fu genres to create a compelling two-hour rags-to-riches tale of a poor drifter in early 20th century Shanghai who rises up in the local mob by virtue of his kung fu skills. Ma Yung Chen (played by Chen Kuan-Tai) so impresses the local bosses that he is quickly given his own teahouse and protection racket, yet he remains loyal to his friends, including a hapless little sidekick, and friendly to the poor. He has a run-in with another local gangster, Tan (David Chiang in an extended cameo), but they soon develop mutual respect.\n\nThe kung fu comes in when Ma is confronted by rival gangster Yang, whose henchmen consist of the Four Champions. When Ma beats three of the Champions in their very first encounter, an enmity develops that finally culminates in a massive brawl at a neutral teahouse where Ma takes on dozens of Yang&apos;s thugs. In this remarkable fight scene, Ma is hit with an ax but continues to fight up and down the two stories of the building with the ax imbedded in his stomach. It&apos;s all shot in the Shaw Bros. studio and backlot in Hong Kong, with some additional work on HK locations familiar to kung fu fans.\n\nChen Kuan-Tai (EXECUTIONERS FROM SHAOLIN) was bigger and stronger-looking than most Shaw Bros. kung fu stars and carries the right air of brute force and intimidation in what is essentially the role of a petty gangster. Yet his broad smile, outgoing manner and protective nature give his rough-hewn character a likability that attracts audience sympathy. Ma is not just a standard vengeance-seeking kung fu student forced to learn new styles to beat a more powerful opponent. He is more at loose ends, trying to find his way in the world and not necessarily on the straight and narrow path.\n\nAside from Chen and David Chiang, the few familiar kung fu faces in the cast include Cheng Kay Yeh (as Chen&apos;s sidekick), Ku Feng (as one of the champions) and Wang Ching. Top-billed actress Ching Li co-stars as Chen&apos;s love interest, a singer in the restaurant he runs, although her role is less significant than the billing would indicate. The film was directed by kung fu specialist Chang Cheh, with Pao Hsueh Li given a co-directing credit. The action directors are an impressive lot and include Tang Chia, Liu Chia Liang (Lau Kar Leung), and Liu Chia Yung.\n\nADDENDUM: A follow-up of sorts is the similarly-styled MAN OF IRON (1972), also reviewed on this site, which also co-stars Chen Kuan Tai and Ching Li, but gives Ms. Ching a larger, more interesting role. QUEEN BOXER (1974), also reviewed on this site, is an unofficial non-Shaw sequel to SHANTUNG and focuses on the sister of Ma Yung Chen as she arrives in Shanghai and begins a quest for vengeance. She is played by the phenomenal kung fu diva, Chia Ling (billed as Judy Lee).\n\nIn December 2003, Celestial/IVL released a restored, remastered, letter-boxed, subtitled Region 3 DVD of BOXER FROM SHANTUNG. That&apos;s the one to see."

What started out as having potential turned turned into the hope that it would end soon so we could go home.",

Does he keep his vows even at the cost of his own freedom and maybe his life, certainly his reputation.\n\nThat is what Montgomery Clift is faced with. German actor O.E. Hasse who Clift worked with on The Big Lift is the caretaker of a church where Clift is assigned. He takes the priest&apos;s garments and commits murder in them. And then offers confession to Clift. Clift knows the murder victim as well and could have his own reason for doing him harm. Of course police detective Karl Malden suspects him.\n\nHow this all gets resolved is the plot of the story. But let me give you a hint. The title of the original story is Our Two Consciences. And the consciences referred to are Monty Clift&apos;s and someone else&apos;s.\n\nClift and the rest of the cast do a fine job in this minor Alfred Hitchcock film. But the acting honors in this go to O.E. Hasse, an really oily malevolent villain who is enjoying the predicament he&apos;s put the priest in. You won&apos;t forget him.\n\nFans of Hitchcock and Clift will be entertained and others will enjoy it as well.",

I said &quot;touching&quot; in the meaning that something in it - humour, breathtaking adventures, worth of respect friendship of man and horse, magic of arabian desert and idea of will, both human and animal, that is the reason for success - all these are mixed in unique brew, called &quot;Hidalgo&quot;. I would recommend this movie to all people of all ages, whose hearts are still alive and able to sympathize. Take your kids or go alone - anyway manage somehow to watch this movie. It is so pure and mood lifting,so I can compare it in its influence on viewer only with &quot;Big Fish&quot;. I&apos;m not a critic and I  won&apos;t talk about &quot;actors&apos; play, plot&quot;, etc etc etc. I&apos;m just telling about my own experience and feelings that this movie put in me.

Its easy to see what fueled the Zucker brothers to lampoon the Airport series so shamelessly. Let&apos;s look at the cast:  George Kennedy, Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Susan Blakely..not bad so far.  Not so fast, because in come the supporting cast: Mercedes McCaimbridge (as a Russian gym instructor), Martha Raye, Jimmie Walker (!), Sylvia Krystel ( as a stewardess ), Avery Schreiber, and Bibi Andersson (as a prostitute). The plot has pot holes that would do Ed Wood proud.  It is so bad dramatically that it plays like a comedy.  And funny it it...very very funny.  Watch this on a double bill with Airplane!"

      "reviewBody": "I picked this up in Poundland expecting very little except that the word &apos;crime&apos; in the title got my attention, and I&apos;ll watch any type of heist film. It was past one in the morning when I saw it, and I considered going to bed instead, then, after watching the first few scenes of the 95m movie (it said 84m on the box) I thought I&apos;d watch half of it today and the other half tomorrow but it kept me watching till the end, occasionally laughing out loud. Comedy caper films nearly always fail. The Italian Job is over-rated. Don&apos;t even get me started on public-school- educated Guy Ritchie&apos;s films. But any fan of Donald Westlake&apos;s Dortmunder books, in which a hapless crime planner is saddled with a team of non-starters and has to extricate himself from increasing complications, will see that this is the best Dortmunder movie the late Westlake never wrote. The only successful Dortmunder adaptation was How to Steal a Diamond in Four Uneasy Lessons (also known as The Hot Rock). All the others failed to a lesser or greater extent. Despite the predominantly French tone, and the minimal characterisation of Depardieu&apos;s character (Dortmunder is usually silent, unless complaining, anyway) this is what a Dortmunder adaptation should be, even though it isn&apos;t. Not a great movie, by any means, with too many respectful nods to Tarantino (surely the greater influence here, and not Ritchie?) but a very watchable one that keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Wayne Newton&apos;s (yes, that&apos;s a man singing) &apos;Danke Schoen&apos; is used to great effect.",

It&apos;s a decent, if unoriginal attempt at horror, and is somewhat effective. Then again, this movie is chock-full of flaws.\n\nFirst is the lack of coherent continuity. The movie confusingly switches from the past and present without warning, and has quite a few badly-placed flashback sequences. The next thing is the complete lack of originality. There is not one but TWO long-haired vengeful female ghosts, gory deaths reminiscent of every other slasher in the world, an ending clearly jacked from every other sequel-promising slasher. The last thing is how ineffective it is: yes, it is effective to a degree, but not as scary as it could have been. Having said all that, &quot;Gawi&quot; does have a few good twists along the way, and I must say, a fairly gripping mystery story going for it.\n\nIf you like slashers, or liked the director&apos;s later movie &quot;Phone&quot;, this is recommended.\n\nMy rating: 6/10",

Three people in environmental suits are the only characters. Two shared a linked breathing tube, and one of them is apparently dying. They are stalked by a third, with an independent breathing apparatus - but why?\n\nAll this and more is conveyed in just a few minutes and without any dialog whatsoever. The superb setting and cinematography, solid acting and your imagination do the rest. \n\nThis is an excellent short science fiction film. I will look out for directors Jens Raunkjær Christensen and Jonas Drotner Mouritsen in the future. \n\nSee Connected at http://www.ov43.com/",

In this desultory tale , the director did not seem to make up his mind: comedy or melodrama?The only relatively interesting character,the painter , played by talented Lemaire ,could provide the movie with good ideas: he appears masked ,in a society he despises ,then dressed up as a pirate ,but the poor directing does not help him at all and he&apos;s forced to overact.\n\n&quot;Frou Frou 1955&quot; is a poor man&apos;s &quot;Lola Montès&quot; ;both were released the same year and both were written by Cecil Saint -Laurent;but a great director makes the difference :Max Ophuls&apos; opus is considered a classic whereas Augusto Genina&apos;s effort is a dud.\n\nThe Office Catholique Du Cinema blamed the music hall scenes which featured topless women:what else could they do? Today,only the main musical theme ,the &quot;Frou Frou &quot; waltz ,has survived and is sometimes played in Thés Dansants or wedding banquets"

If you are a fan of Ghost in the shell &amp; Matrix this is for you &quot;a must see anime&quot; The connections between the first part and the second aren&apos;t many, so if you haven&apos;t watched the first part, there is nothing that you won&apos;t understand in this anime. Unlike some other anime with complexed plot and long boring scenes with never ending conversations, this is anime with great story (although as I said from the first part is better) and you won&apos;t wanna miss a second. The action scenes where cyborgs with big machine guns fight combined with awesome music will blow you away. Another good thing is that they aren&apos;t so much nasty bloody scenes like in the first part so this anime can only be watched by the younger audience. 10 out of 10 no doubt about it!",

But I wouldn&apos;t like to talk about the plot...\n\nRight the previous day I had seen Grbavica, a film by Jasmila Zbanic- a young director from Bosnia Herzegovina , starring Mirjana Karanovic, the most known actress around the Balkan countries (except maybe for Greece). Grbavica was plain, interesting but totally in control and simply a nice film with a spicy subject matter. Most enjoyable of all,Mirjana Karanovic! I was happy enough to see all her charm, if u can call it that way, in a fresh film by an upcoming director but when I saw Das Fräulein, then I finally realized the depths of her acting...\n\nSorry for making such an intro but this film is about her and if you get to realize what she is standing for , everything makes a lot more sense. Of course she is not the main dish and that&apos;s also an exciting thing!\n\nDirector Andrea Staka made a film to talk about what these people carry with them, what they are made of. We don&apos;t really know... We don&apos;t... It&apos;s not about characters in a film, not about a plot, it&apos;s about the actors,the director,the people of Bosnia,Yugoslavia,Serbia.. Political backgrounds, immigration, war,personal past all mixed up with youth, health and life perspective...\n\n... all packed up in a simple, honest way... That&apos;s what it is about!",

The source material is so dense and intricate it was always going to be hard to condense that into a 2 hour movie but I feel the makers manage to keep it fleshy whilst making the respective characters interesting and watchable. The acting on show is more than adequate, Harrison Ford is great in the role of Jack Ryan, he manages to portray him as a sensitive family man who can step up to the plate when things get ugly, and Anne Archer is solid enough as the wife and mother caught up in the web of nastiness unfolding.\n\nThe baddies are led by the brooding Sean Bean who is a little under written, whilst Richard Harris is sadly underused, but the action set pieces make their mark and thankfully we get a riveting final reel that cements the steady ride we have under taken. It is formulaic to a degree, but that is OK if the combined efforts of all involved are spot on, and here they are, 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This documentary film by Morgan Spurlock asks the intriguing and topical question: What would happen to a normal 33-year-old man in perfect health who stands six feet two and weighs 185 pounds if he ate nothing but McDonald&apos;s fast food for thirty days?\n\nWell, it is not recorded that he shrunk. In fact, Spurlock, forsaking his vegan girlfriend&apos;s healthy cuisine, gained about 25 pounds and saw his cholesterol level shoot up to dangerous levels as he huffed and puffed his way three times a day through myriad Big Macs and fillet o&apos; fish sandwiches, milk shakes, sodas, fries and other not-so-delicate items from the menu of the world&apos;s largest purveyor of fast food. He had hired three doctors and a registered dietician to check his vital signs and give him a thorough physical exam prior to this experiment in not-so-fine dining. Before the gorging was done all three doctors and the dietician advised him in the most uncertain terms for the sake of his health to stop eating the sugar-laden, fat-smeared, nearly fiber-free &quot;diet.&quot; But Spurlock, trooper that he is, amid the McTingles and the McPukes, hung in there until the very end. \n\nI can report that he survived the experience. Whether the viewer will is another matter. If you yourself (God help you) are seriously overweight you might want to pass on this excruciatingly detailed misadventure under the Golden Arches. All that fat slapping against those waddling thighs (Spurlock mercifully fuzzed out the faces of his subjects, allowing us only body shots), all that jiggling flesh under those XXXL garments might be too uncomfortably close to home for some sensitive viewers.\n\nBut was this a fair test of the harmful consequences of eating Happy Meals and being super sized? After all, Spurlock eschewed exercise during the experiment, and of course nobody (?) actually eats every meal at McDonald&apos;s as Spurlock did. Furthermore he actually doubled his normal caloric intake from about 2500 calories a day to about 5000. Regardless I think we can say that his experience was indicative.\n\nThe real question to be asked here (and Spurlock asks it) is whether McDonald&apos;s (or as some have dubbed thee) whether McDeath&apos;s can be or should be held responsible for the epidemic of obesity that is sweeping the country. Spurlock implies that McDonald&apos;s should be held responsible at least for its advertising aimed at children. I agree with this. But I also think that adults ought to know what they are doing. If they choose to chow down at a place that loves to super size and under nourish them, perhaps they themselves should be held responsible for the consequences. However, some people feel that the advertising has been so insidious for so long and the food so addictive to susceptible individuals that McDonald&apos;s ought to be taken to court just as the tobacco companies have been.\n\nFor more information on the epidemic, its consequences, and what can be done about it, I refer the interested reader to The Hungry Gene: The Science of Fat and the Future of Thin by Ellen Ruppel Shell; Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fastest People in the World by Eric Critser; and Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser. Schlosser appears in one of the bonus features being interviewed by Spurlock. This interview is one of the highlights of the DVD. Schlosser is articulate, candid, and very well-informed.\n\nSpurlock of course is a performer as well as a film maker. His directorial style owes something to that of Michael Moore, and his playful on-camera muggings remind me of Ian Wright of PBS&apos;s Globe Trekker series.\n\nSee this as an introduction to this most serious threat to the nation&apos;s health, especially as it affects children. Morgan Spurlock is to be commended for bringing the reality of the epidemic to the attention of the general public.\n\nBy the way, &quot;McTingles&quot; are those highflying, scary feelings you get after rapidly injecting massive amounts of pure sugar and caffeine into your system, usually by gulping your way through a 64-ounce McCola--and to think when I was a kid, Coca-Cola came in six-ounce bottles. How ever did we survive? &quot;McPukes&quot; are self-explanatory.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

Six children genetically cross-bred with avian DNA, complete with wings, take flight around the country to discover their origins. The plot line sums it up. Problem with this movie is some subpar FX, the lack of depth (flashbacks via MTV style don&apos;t cut it) and lack of any reason to care what happens to the kids. The action, so to speak, is pointless and they don&apos;t even try to find their origins, they more or less allude to it. Visually, the sweeping camera work looks very nice over the landscapes as they fly (don&apos;t focus on them, the vfx are horrid as I said) but that cannot save a lackluster effort such as this. I read that this is a series of books that supposedly are pretty good so I assume a sequel is on the way. I won&apos;t be bothering with it if they do. Aside from the main character, Max, the bit players are just there. The kid who blows stuff up at least ended the movie with a funny line. Not really a spoiler nor does it make it worth it to watch just for that. If you know the books, you will be disappointed, and if you don&apos;t know them, you most likely still will be. I know I was.",

In this Stephen King work a boy tries to avoid being cooked and eaten by a witch by occupying her with fanciful stories.\n\nThere were three total stories featuring some well known actors. Some were already established, like Rae Dawn Chong and William Hickey. Others I don&apos;t believe were as well known at the time, such as Christian Slater, Steve Buscemi, and Jullianne Moore.\n\nI thought the three stories were solidly done. I can&apos;t remember the order but the order of preference for me was: 1.) Mummy story, 1A.) Gargoyle story 3.) and a distant third was the cat story.\n\nNone of the stories were very spooky or scary, in fact you could say they were somewhat comical (especially the mummy story), but they all had an intriguing premise. The three stories all wrapped into the initial story made for a good movie.",

The plot is about a trial against three men who tried to earn loads of money by illegal methods to get to Canada and about the lawyers and the judge who get on with the trial and who are being unfaithful to their couples. In the third part of the movie we realize that all the characters are connected when the trial itself is showed. In between, the characters talking,talking,talking and talking their superfluous conversations as usual in French cinema. This is not a must see, but it&apos;s nice enough if you don&apos;t have any other better thing to do than watch this movie.",

It aims for realism, to try and connect the viewer to the characters and make them wonder what THEY would do.\n\nIf you&apos;re after flashy effects and advanced technology, this isn&apos;t a movie for you.

      "reviewBody": "Arriving in cinema&apos;s almost exactly a decade after the Louis de Funès version (L&apos;Avere), Italy&apos;s national treasure Alberto Sordi&apos;s version was released in 1990. And while this IMDb page links to 9 further versions of Moliere&apos;s 1668 play at the time of this writing, there are only two comments written about them, and both of those are for the aforementioned 1980 version. The 1990 version (copyright 1989) was directed by Tonino Cervi, although some sources say it was Alberto Sordi who occupied the directors chair as well as the editors suite.\n\nSordi plays the miser Harpagon himself, known as Arpagone here and does so with relish: Arpagone is able to count money by ear. The setting is moved from Paris to Rome and filmed in actual Roman palaces near Vatican city (Arpagane does business with the Pope and high ranking cardinals) and with a star studded cast including Laura Antonelli as Madame Frosina (who is given the difficult task to find a suitable wife for the miser), Marie Laforet as La Contessa, former miss Italia Anna Kanakis as Arpagone&apos;s daughter and the actor with perhaps the longest resume on this site (and still growing), Christopher Lee as the conniving Cardinal Spinosi.\n\nLee devotes a couple of interesting pages to L&apos;Avaro in his autobiography &quot;Tall, Dark and Gruesome&quot;. It is the only picture in his long career where he forgot his lines, it being a difficult speech in Italian. Methinks Lee is being too hard on himself here, for if no actor ever forgot a line, there would be no blooper reels. (and despite his knowledge of languages his voice was eventually dubbed over). Secondly, the master of the macabre grew very annoyed at the disinterest of the Italian crew who would smoke, talk and wander about during takes. This even included Alberto Sordi himself, who would repeat each one of Christopher Lee&apos;s lines after he said them. At one point it got so bad, Lee slammed his hand on a table to demand silence. Good for him. And he got it, for at least 20 minutes or so.\n\nAs the entire play is centered around the miser of the title (a perfect center role for Sordi one would think), it is a bit difficult at first to keep track of the supporting characters, most especially who is betrothed to whom while secretly loving another. It isn&apos;t until half way through the film that everyone gathers together in one room for some clarity. Of course those familiar with the play will know that family connections will only get more complicated from then on, but that&apos;s neither here nor there. The original concept of characters interrupting each other when breaking the fourth wall is not used unfortunately.\n\n7 out of 10",

Meryl Streep is exellent as the lead role and keeps a believable danish accent all the way through the film. Robert Redford is also excellent as. But of course the best feature of this film is the beautiful African scnery. It captivates the viewer and I think even if the acting was poor the scenery would still make you like the film. I cannot think of any other film I have seen that has matched this one. I recommened it to anyone. This truly is a touching, marvellous film"

      "reviewBody": "John Hughes was truly a magnificent writer for teenagers of the 80&apos;s. Even though a lot of people hated his previous works, it doesn&apos;t matter since many people have flaws in their career once in a while. Well, this is one of John Hughes&apos;s well-written classics: The Breakfast Club. It follows a group of teenage kids who have done something to get them to have detention on Saturday!(Bummer having to stay in that school on a weekend!) Sounds pretty simple huh? Well, later on the characters get to know each other thanks to the brilliant writing from John Hughes! Judd Nelson plays Bender who in the movie is called &quot;the Criminal&quot; and is a straight up asshole but in a cool way. The lovely Molly Ringwald plays Claire who attempts to hide things from people kinda like bottling her emotions. Plus there are other characters I wont get into. My favorite character is obviously Bender since he throws out the jokes which makes this movie funny. Now, be warned! You may start tearing up because there are a lot of issues covered in this movie that relates to real life. The stories the characters tell are very poignant and moving and riveting. So don&apos;t be surprised if you start crying during the movie. This is a brilliant John Hughes movie that launched his career next to Sixteen Candles(which is another good Hughes film). What makes this movie so great you say? The way the characters develop is genius thanks to the magnificent directing! The jokes are CLEVER unlike so many other comedies *cough Meet the Spartans*. However, while this movie is great it does have some flaws. One is its a little too long for my taste and its tone is a little mixed up at times. Like is this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? But thats a minor thing for me since I can relate to this movie as a teenager next to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Plus, there are so many memorable quotes in this movie! Go see John Hughes&apos;s finest written film! Sincerely Yours, The Breakfast Club",

As Americans it seems we think in 1945 when the war (WWII) ended and the German concentration camps were liberated it was game over. That said, it was literally shocking to see and hear the unforgivable behavior of the British during the period 1945-1948. What the hell was their OBSESSION with camps? This incessant need to herd people from one camp to another, constantly detaining. Creepy weird, oddly caveman, to see it was nauseating. As an American the thought of being &quot;herded&quot; is beyond my imagination. As I watch I wonder; What did GB have to gain from their aggressive imperialism as regards the region known as Palestine? Admittedly, I loved watching the British get their ass KICKED. As history notes, it&apos;s been 1 long decline for British civilization since that time. A wrecked economy, poverty and ignorance. We can see it in their teeth. Amazon doesn&apos;t have this but Netflix does, run don&apos;t walk. It&apos;s that good.",

      "reviewBody": "In Austria, the medical student Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) develops a serum to resuscitate the dead while working with a famous scientist that mysteriously dies. Herbert travels to Massachusetts and his application is accepted by the Miskatonic Medical University Dean Alan Halsey (Robert Sampson); then he moves to the basement of the house of Daniel &apos;Dan&apos; Cain (Bruce Abbott), a medical student that is seeking a roommate to share his expenses and that is in love with Alan&apos;s daughter Megan Halsey (Barbara Crampton). When Megan&apos;s cat disappears, she finds it dead in Herbert&apos;s refrigerator. Later, Daniel hears a cat and Herbert screaming and he sees the cat alive violently attacking Herbert and they kill the animal again. Herbert invites Daniel to work with him, but Megan sees the bizarre experiment and tells her father that expels the students from the University. But Herbert and Daniel go to the morgue to find a corpse to revive and they are surprised by the dean that is murdered by a resurrected man. Herbert injects the re-animating fluid in Alan that revives but the envious and greedy Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) wants his formula to become famous.\n\n&quot;Re-Animator&quot; is one of my favorite cult-movie and I have just watched it again at least for the sixth time (last time I saw it was on 21 March 2000). This funny and gore B-movie has excellent special effects and made Jeffrey Combs worshiped for the rest of his career. Barbara Crampton is very beautiful and the scene in the laboratory with she naked and Dr. Carl Hill beheaded is one of the funniest I have ever seen. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Re-Animator&quot;\n\nNote: On 26 August 2012, I saw this film again, now on DVD.\n\nNote: On 25 June 2015, I saw this movie again.",

The film has the constant pace and vivacity and glee that is (stereotypically?) associated with Renoir - the film is something of a romantic whirl, with the interconnections of men and women are beguilingly dramatized in all their fleeting glory. Even the scenes with the wicked boss have an initial  joie de vivre. Lange himself retains a restrained \tcalm at the heart of it all - until he comes to illustrate the normal man who takes a desperate, self-sacrificing stand for the good of others. Although idealistic, his action resonates when offset against the explicitly cartoonish heroism of the Arizona Jim character (which we see embodied in some epically corny tableaux), and the impact thrives from being based in a muscular evocation of left-wing collectivist sympathies (a strand that comes over heavily in the almost idyllic scenes of things after the demise of the capitalist - with workers happy and lovers unfettered; although I found the very end of the film a bit puzzling)."

      "reviewBody": "I had always wanted to check out Rossellini&apos;s TV work (which took up most of his later career), if only to make a personal opinion of it  given that it&apos;s not a very well regarded period  apart from THE RISE OF LOUIS XIV (1966)  for a film-maker often considered among cinema&apos;s greatest.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the ultra low-key approach and use of mostly non-professional actors (the one recognizable face here being &quot;Euro-Cult&quot; favorite Paul Muller) resembles most of all Rossellini&apos;s earlier religious film THE FLOWERS OF ST. FRANCIS (1950). From the title itself, one realizes that this &apos;epic&apos; production tackles events from the Bible that are often overlooked; while the character of St. Peter  a prominent figure here  does feature in the likes of QUO VADIS (1951) and THE ROBE (1953), relatively little has been done with the life of St. Paul: he first appears in the second episode, but gradually assumes the central role throughout. Considering that he was the one to convert my native island of Malta to Christianity, it was nice to be able to get a close look at the man  as imagined by a master film-maker, no less  even if the famous shipwreck itself, which landed him over here (allegedly right into the village I hail from), is only alluded to in the film! \n\nThough the talky and uneventful nature of the nearly six-hour long ACTS OF THE APOSTLES hardly lends itself to excitement and spectacle, Rossellini&apos;s eye for naturalistic detail  aided by a wistful ethnic score by Mario Nascimbene, light years removed from his rousing signature theme for THE VIKINGS (1958)  gives one a real sense of the time and the place (the film was actually shot in Tunisia). Besides, it does quite well in delineating the way Christianity was misunderstood first of all by the Jews themselves because it went against their assumption of being God&apos;s chosen people (and which led to the adoption of circumcision as a sign of identification)  in that this nascent religion decreed that Jesus had died for the absolution of all sins and not for the benefit of just one nation! \n\nNeedless to say, I find myself more responsive as a film buff to Rossellini&apos;s innovative early &quot;Neo-Realist&quot; work and the thought-provoking series of films with Ingrid Bergman; that said, I&apos;ll be following ACTS OF THE APOSTLES with THE MESSIAH (1975)  the director&apos;s last work for the cinema which, in narrative terms, obviously precedes this and is, by all accounts, handled in similarly minimalist fashion",

      "reviewBody": "Many of my fellow Eurohorror enthusiasts seem to have been disappointed by Camillo Mastrocinque&apos;s &quot;La Cripta e l&apos;incubo&quot; aka. &quot;Crypt of the Vampire&quot; of 1964. For understandable reasons as the film, which stars Horror icon Christopher Lee, certainly doesn&apos;t range among the most memorable efforts in Italian Gothic Horror from the 1960s. Fact is, however, that this country, time and sub-genre stands for many of the greatest Horror films ever brought to screen, and even many of the lesser productions, such as this film, are entertaining films as such. This is one of only two Horror films by director Mastrocinque, the other being the vastly superior &quot;Un Angelo Per Satana&quot; of 1966 starring Genre-Goddess Barbara Steele (my favorite actress). This &quot;Crypt of the Vampire&quot; very obviously borrowed many story-elements from another Italian Gothic Horror film, Mario Bava&apos;s unequaled masterpiece &quot;La Maschera Del Demonio&quot; aka. &quot;Black Sunday of 1960 (probably my choice for the greatest Horror film of all-time, and, of course, it also stars Barbara Steele). It can in no way compete with Bava&apos;s masterpiece, of course, nor with the many other Italian Gothic highlights from the day, be it Bava&apos;s, Antoino Margheriti&apos;s, or Riccardo Freda&apos;s films of even with Mastrocinque&apos;s own &quot;Angelo Per Satana&quot;. Yet &quot;Crypt of the Vampire&quot; has many qualities. One has to give it to director Mastrocinque that he was capable of creating an uncanny atmosphere in spite of an obviously low budget. Again, he did so more impressively in &quot;Un Angelo Per Satana&quot;, but one has to admit that this film is also highly atmospheric.\n\nCount Karnstein (Christopher Lee) has sent for a doctor to help his daughter Laura (Adriana Ambesi). The young lady Karnstein has been tormented by terrible nightmares, and it is believed that she is possessed by the evil spirit of a dead ancestor... The film&apos;s major weakness is that it is too slow-going, especially in the first half. It is always atmospheric though, and the film really catches up in the second half, and gets quite creepy in some parts. Also, there are some nicely demented characters, such as a disfigured beggar. As it was the case with a truly brilliant Gothic film from the same year, Antonio Margheriti&apos;s &quot;Danza Macabra&quot; (aka. Castle of Blood&quot;), this film has a certain lesbian subtext. The female cast in this film are beautiful, but not comparable to Barbara Steele (I can&apos;t stop praising her) and Margarete Robsahm who stunned viewers in &quot;Danza Macabra&quot;. Also, while the (implied) lesbianism is a nicely exploitative element in this film, the explicit stuff that became common practice in Exploitation cinema only a few years later in the late 60s makes it look very harmless. Even so, it is a fun element of the film. More screen time for the great Christopher Lee would certainly have helped the film. The female cast members are entirely hot, but none of them is extremely talented. As said, the film&apos;s strong point lies in the atmosphere. Overall, &quot;Crypt of the Vampire&quot; is by no means a must-see or even a very good film. However, I personally enjoyed it and I think that many of my fellow fans of Italian 60s Gothic Horror might see it the same way.",

As traveling salesmen they find the saucermen and plan to make money by showing them around the country.\n\nThere is the &quot;teenage&quot; couple who also find the saucermen but are not believed by authorities. These are the two parallel story lines. This is one of the first movies to use the &quot;teenagers save the world&quot; theme that became popular during this period.\n\nThe saucermen makeup is well done by the makeup genius of that period, Paul Blaisdell. His balloon-headed, bug-eyed, mini-martians are still one of my favorites and their photos and other likeness still appear from time to time. Unfortunately, at the time of this review this movie is not available on Video or DVD. But we can hope!"

You will have to overlook the obvious attempts to make the most of the 3D film though. A very solid entry into the franchise and we get to see Jason claiming his hockey mask.",

Lauren Graham was probably the best casting in this film as the understanding, patient wife and Joel McHale was great as a sarcastic, weary son. But Candice Bergen was also wasted as a tired, docile wife. Clark Duke, although a brilliant, talented actor, was also miscast as a veteran with PTSD. What??

With the exception of Ben Stiller&apos;s lead all the original supporting leads take virtually a back seat in this third instalment. But several great new characters are introduced namely Frances McDormand as Captain Chantel DuBois, Bryan Cranston as Vitaly and the fabulous Martin Short as Stefano. All there performances are stand out but wished Shorts Stefano was featured more. Cranston as Vitaly was beautifully menacing but it is the wacky deadly policewoman in charge of hunting down and capturing the animals as they make their way across Europe which is the centre of the narrative drive. Since the police team where obviously the bad guys (DuBois only wants to capture Mike (Ben Stiller) so she can add his head to her mounted collection of stuffed animals on her office wall) it was ironic that I watched this in France since the police were portrayed as bunch gung-ho obsessive freaks (DuBois crawls around on all fours to sniff down her prey like a dog come insect). The film was screened in 3D, initially I was apprehensive since I don&apos;t really enjoy 3D movies but this was a pleasant surprise. After a few minutes I had completely forgotten that I was wearing the 3D glasses and actually...in the spectacular climatic scene I was completely wowed. An explosion of vivid movement and colour formed an intricate moving tapestry of light and colour that was gorgeous to watch. The kids will love it and any one young at heart enough to let themselves loose themselves in escapist fun for a couple of hours. One of the best &quot;family&quot; animation films that I&apos;ve seen in years and highly recommended. Oh I nearly forgot....Baron Cohen&apos;s (as The King) love affair with a giant mute bear is both surreal and priceless!"

      "reviewBody": "From whichever domain that currently houses the soul of Aeschylus might be heard rapid rotative sounds if the author of the Oresteian Trilogy would happen to be cognizant of this obvious but perfunctory adaptation, as advertised by the film&apos;s producers, of the timeless conflict between Elektra and Clytemnestra. Shelley Winters performs as Cora, a widow whose bereavement is due to homicidal inclinations that she shares with her three sons, their prey a string of husbands, men who are qualified by financial worth while being fatally fond of the well-upholstered finagler. Cora has overplayed her hand, however, because the young daughter, Ellie Mae (Sheila Kennedy), of her latest victim believes that her father was murdered by Cora and her offspring, and is not shy about accusing them of the act. Ellie is fetching and her charms are not ignored by the three sons, nor by Cora&apos;s ersatz brother (and actual lover), so that when the virginal lovely feels that the suspicions she harbours respecting her sire&apos;s demise have been confirmed, she designs a deadly revenge. This retribution enables Ellie to use her allure upon the male quartet and, while the results can only be considered predictable, a clear opportunity is hereby presented for the succulent Kennedy to doff her clothing, obviously a principal motive for the making of this film. Although not tightly directed, and rather overstretched, these are not sharp disadvantages for this low-budget work shot with style in Dallas and nearby Maypearl, Texas, thanks to unexpectedly high production values, specially as regards the artistic camera technique of cinematographer George Tirl, and additionally skillful visual and sound editing. Amused satisfaction is also to be gained from the singular costumes designed by Christy Haines for Winters, markedly for her character&apos;s witty funeral attire. In sum, this is a weakly scripted piece of buffoonery, set within a recognizable social milieu, that provides frothy entertainment through fine comedic turns by George Gobel as a bemused minister overwhelmed by a rash of funeral service requirements, Pat Paulsen as a local sheriff enamoured of the zaftig widow, and Ouida White who enjoys herself as a hilariously overwrought potential home buyer. Tirl makes excellent use of main dish Kennedy while she gambols through a meadow of bluebonnets in the film&apos;s most enduring image.",

      "reviewBody": "Most novels may not necessary translate well to the stage, let alone to the Big screen. &apos;Billy Liar&apos; has achieved all that. I have just recently discovered this &apos;hidden&apos; gem from among the throngs of DVD shelves. The reason I &apos;picked it up&apos; was due largely to the director&apos;s name, John Schlesinger. Having seen his catapult to American fame &apos;Midnight Cowboy&apos;, I reckon why not check out his earlier British work. Boy was I astonished!\n\nFirst of all, the script. The adapted screenplay by the original writers Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall is wickedly witty and performative for theatre dramatics, yet it crosses perfectly to the realms of cinema. The cut-aways to the lavishly staged dream sequences are so effective, so in contrast to the stark realism that we get from most of the on-location filming (from the DVD bonus features, the two writers actually take you on a present day &apos;tour&apos; of a couple of the &apos;real&apos;locations, juxtaposed with snippets of the film sequences at exactly the same spots).\n\nAlso commendable is the black and white cinematography by veteran Bristish lensman Denys Coop. Done in Cinemascope, the depth of Hinchcliffe Avenue can only be fully realised in the widescreen format, so avoid the re-formatted tv release at all costs!\n\nAnd I must say the most amazing thing about the film is still the performance. Schlesinger rarely fails to bring out the best from his actors, and this seminal work is no exception. All the supporting cast, from &apos;Mr Shadrack &apos;, Billy&apos;s family and girlfriends played very well to be the &apos;plastic reality&apos; that&apos;s driving Billy insane. Hence, he seeks solance,affirmation and escape in his fantasies and lies, but ultimately we know which track he ends back on.\n\nTom Courtenay is simply &apos;Billy Liar&apos;. Somehow, he bears an uncanny resemblance to Ewen Macgregor, or perhaps that&apos;s just me. It was mentioned that Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay, who have both played the title character on stage, were considered for the the film role at the same time. I can&apos;t help but only wonder how it would&apos;ve turned out if Finney got the part instead...\n\nLast but not least, who can resist Julie Christie, aka Liz. She is Billy&apos;s object of desire cum temptation cum salvation, very much in contrast to Billy&apos;s inhabited world... simply beautiful. The intro sequence of Liz as she walks along the streets of Bradford is another highlight of the film, undescribable with words. You gotta see it for ya self~\n\nWhat else can I say about &apos;Billy Liar&apos;. I guess everyone was once a &apos;Billy Liar&apos;, or still has a Billy Liar in him or herself. Well, at least I can say it for me self. Perhaps on a finer day, I WILL CATCH thee TRAIN to &apos;London&apos;.......\n\nI give it 9/10 :-)",

I thought he was pretty good here but I wouldn&apos;t call him one of the all-time greats. Crawford steals the show as Haines&apos; girl and delivers a very good performance. Crawford also comes off very attractive here. Also interesting is the football subplot thrown in, which leads to a big Navy-Army game at the end. The football scenes are handled very well and the cinematography is very good."

      "reviewBody": "The year after World War II ended brought the first dramas to look at the plight of returning veterans trying to readjust to civilian norms.  The Best Years of Our Lives was the big hit that year, but there were others, too. The title song in Till The End of Time, which was adapted from a Chopin polonaise, snakes through the movie wearing many skins, from saraband to Swing, constituting one of the more effective leitmotifs of 40s-movie scores.  The story centers on Guy Madison, returning from the Pacific to his Los Angeles family.  His parents expect the boy who left, not the man (physically, at least) who came back; they recoil when he wants to share his experiences in battle.  So he starts to rebel against their sheltered and complacent life but has little idea of what to do with his own.\n\nHis love life is riven as well.  One the one side there&apos;s the brash bobby-soxer next door, symbolizing what he used to be; on the other is weary war-widow Dorothy McGuire (among her most affecting roles), another survivor of the horrors of combat.\n\nIt&apos;s tempting to assume that Madison landed this meaty role (he&apos;s constantly on screen) solely because of his looks -- extraordinary, even by Hollywood standards.  But he delivers a natural, if a bit bashful, performance.  Only when buddy Robert Mitchum resurfaces halfway through the movie does he suffer by comparison.  As a black sheep with a steel plate in his skull, Mitchum strikes the sparks that would ignite his long stardom; Madison, while pleasant and competent, comes up with nothing new and starts to grow monotonous (his career took him to TV westerns and European cheapies).\n\nDirector Edward Dmytryk (Murder, My Sweet; Back to Bataan) tones down for this leisurely character study, which remains absorbing and at times close to moving.  He missteps once, very near the end, when a blast at bigotry comes flying out of left field, and he probably had to settle for the upbeat ending the studio wanted.  But it was left to film noir, which dealt with similar issues obliquely (Blue Dahlia, Act of Violence, Dmytryk&apos;s own Crossfire) that probed them more profoundly.",

I will say, however, that the acting wasn&apos;t all bad.  I mean...how could the poor young actors do much with what was written to begin with.  I was at least able to finish it.  It seems to me that this is obviously a first film for the director...and how many of us could even do this well.  The mask was cool, the girls were hot...  Would I watch it again?  Probably not...but at least people are talking about it.  Even I would rent it based on the below comments just to see what all the fuss is about."
