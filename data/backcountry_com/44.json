I dont know how many times I have rappelled without locking my carabiner because it is froze. these take some getting used to especially with big gloves. Once you get the hang of it its a dream. No more breathing on your carabiners trying to get them to unlock. These are the only lockers on the market that do not freeze a huge advancement in the safety of winter climbing.",

Grease will flow out and all over the leg of the stove/floor. Placed a cup in the provided hanging holder but the cup melted quickly. Also, a carrying bag should be standard.",

They do not have the same give as other Chaco styles - I wouldn’t consider them adjustable any more than a pair of heals with a typical buckle strap. Even on the last hole on the buckle strap, they cut into the top of my foot. I wear an 8 in Chacos and usually a 9 in their boots. Very sad to have had to send the 8.5 I ordered back!!",

        "reviewBody": "The pack is yet to be used, but will be a couple times soon.   There is a &apos;fatal flaw&apos; in the design of the day pack bladder holder.  Customer service was unable to grasp it and/or give me a straight answer.   The day pack is a roll top like a dry bag. In that design MHW forgot about HOW the bladder hose would EXIT the day pack to the user.  The only options, from my perspective not MHW, is to either cut a hole in the day pack (immediately voiding any warranty) or leaving the top open, which interferes with how it attaches to the main pack.  I exclusively use a bladder for hydrations so I&apos;m struggling with whether I want to use this pack at all now.  Another more minor flaw is the sewing on the hip belt.  It was not finished well and missed by Quality Control on the particular pack I received.  There is a ROUGH part that I am hoping gets used to smooth, but we&apos;ll see as it touches directly to my person and may cause a hot spot and chaffing.  Now that I&apos;m done complaining about it.  The design features are great.  It, in theory, met what I needed, and I&apos;m eager to try it.   Not  sure how I&apos;ll use my 3 ltr bladder though.   I can&apos;t recommend this pack at this time, but I own it and will have to deal with it and see...",

I am yet to take it on a long trip, but I have confidence it will remain comfortable on a multi-day drip. \r\n\r\nAfter trying so many backpacks, it came down to this bag, and the Gregory paragon 58. Though the paragon was slightly more comfortable, it is made with flimsy fabric doesn&apos;t seem like it would last very long or take abuse from the trail very well. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would change about the PCT 55 is the hydration reservoir pocket, which doubles as a day pack. This part of the bag is sort of clunky and not the easiest to deal with. I would rather have a traditional hydration reservoir pocket on the bag. A little disappointing, but not a deal breaker.\r\n\r\nAlong with this, the pockets on the hip belt don&apos;t seem large enough to be practical, but the comfort and the durability of the rest of the bag makes it seem as though its worth the sacrifice, especially since this bag has such large side pockets where things can be stuffed. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a durable bag that will last me decades, not to mention Mountain Hardwear has a great repair shop for their products if they happen to break or wear down prematurely.",

She likes to camp and her old tent was just worn out and not worth repairing. So far we have been lucky and have not experienced any severe weather so i cannot attest to how this tent holds up in the wind or rain. Its sets up quickly and looks to be very sturdy. The rain fly is good and large. I like that the screens on the sides of the tent are well above the ground. This should prevent wind blown rain for making its way in like it does on tents where the screen is lower to the ground. The top vents zipper closed but i have to wonder if there is still not a chance of wind blown rain entering at the top of the tent. I guess we will just have to wait and see.\n\nThe zippers work very well. The tent is very roomy for a two person tent. \n\nSo far my only suggestions for improvement are to make the compression straps on the bag go all the way around the bag so they are not dependent on the stitching and add a carry handle. Other than that I am very satisfied so far.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The tent is built with amazing material, it is sturdy and looks very durable while also being fairly lightweight for it’s materials.\n\nI had read online that they had hd a water infiltration during a storm I. Patagonia while trying it out. I assumed the storm they had was something else and that it was not likely to happen here in the US.\n\nThe first time I tried it out, we got stormy weather and a lot of rain - I was so excited to camp in the rain. But quickly, the water started coming in. We had a lot of rain, but it was a pretty standard storm for northern canada and Vermont . The rain came through the air vent (as pictured on one of the photos) and was leaking steady on our sleeping bags all night. We ended up having to place a towel (pic) under that closed and zipped vent to stop the leak. In the morning, there was a lot of condensation on the rain cover of the tent that was also leaking through the bug fly (which is the only fabric between un and the rain cover of the tent). No need to say I was disappointed. \nI have however contacted customer service and, as usual, STS service is incredible. They are currently evaluating the tent and will let me know in the upcoming week if it is a design fault or something with the specific tent I received.",

Two people are able to comfortably sit up in the tent because of the unique design allowing for ample headroom. A cargo loft keeps small items off of the tent floor, and the venting is appreciated. Lightweight and compact, it fits into a duffle bag, with sleeping bags, pillows, kitchen and clothing for two! Perfect for car or airplane travel.",

        "reviewBody": "This is another SeaToSummit outstanding product! I went from camping in heavy Kodiak Canvas to a tiny Telos TR2 - Two Person Freestanding Tent. This tent is incredibly light weight and suitable for air travel. It conveniently packs up into 3 small stuff sacs that are provided. Freestanding is great, especially when you&apos;re trying to set up on a wood platform. Most of my camping is during the summertime months or in warm climates. I brought this with me down to the USVI and the screens gave me plenty of airflow. I had zero issues with moisture. Personally, I do miss the optional zip up and down windows. I think that option would afford an individual a bit more privacy and night time warmth. As of yet, I haven&apos;t personally tent camped during a heatwave.",

The Telos is about the same weight, a bit less bulk but considerably roomier on the inside both floorspace and headroom-wise. Important consideration is that the Telos is free standing whereas the CF absolutely had to be staked out. Not a big deal on a forest floor or meadow but much of our useage is streamside, sand and gravel bars.

One night had heavy rain. The fly cinched down very nicely and nothing got wet. Tent is super light and packed nicely into one of my dry bags. Once set up it was very sturdy in the wind and rain. Im 6 ft tall and liked the wide area for head room and I didn’t have issues getting in and out. I would definitely recommend buying the ground tarp which actually attaches to the tent frame itself so there was no slippage and nothing hung out with the rain. I also got the gear loft which was nice for me because I always seem to loose things while sleeping. Overall I would definitely recommend.",

The guy lines are also incredibly easy to use, although I&apos;m curious how long they will last. \n\nWhat keeps it from five stars is the stakes aren&apos;t as durable as I would&apos;ve liked (wife bent one the first time using), and the hangout mode setup is not practical for a single person in anything but dead still wind, a slight breeze makes this thing difficult.",

Taking the wet tent down in rain, rowing in the rain all day, setting it up again in the rain, even then I was able to stay mostly dry. I learned it&apos;s important to keep the fly taut and the ground tarp tucked in a bit, as when taking the tent down I found a pool of water between the tent floor and the tarp, but even then the tent floor kept my gear dry. The lightweight gray anodized stakes provided aren&apos;t sufficient for use in sand, so I brought along about 5 pounds of antique steel stakes, and added my own reflective red guy lines to keep the tent stable in the wind. While I like the neutral gray color of the tent, it would be better to have some brighter colors for the stakes, guy lines, tie-down points, and stuff sacks.",

        "reviewBody": "There are a lot of great features to this tent, truly innovative. It&apos;s very light, about what my old one person tent was (though I carried more stakes than this came with). The tension ridge design is excellent, truly giving peak head room all the way across the tent. The dry setup is handy, the pockets great. On the iffy side is the packaging, which makes it easy to divide the tent in two for sharing the load backpacking. There is zero room for anything extra, like a footprint which is recommended, and is not totally solid when carried as one piece. Strapping it to the outside of your pack might be sketchy. The negative was that in very heavy rain it leaked through the roof vent, right at a seam, and dripped much of the night. It stays dry in light rain, and would for a brief heavy rain, and the roof vent does wonders for eliminating condensation, but in a long heavy rain we were wet. It also seemed very narrow for a 3 person tent, with two 30&quot; pads just barely squeezing in on the wide side. There may be some way to solve the leak, like orienting the tent so the vent is downhill, but it&apos;s at the head end so that&apos;s tough. A great tent if you don&apos;t plan to use it in heavy all night rain.",

I&apos;ve also used this a handful of times for backpacking in other seasong. Whether I&apos;m strapping snowshoes or my tent to the back of this bag, I have a place for everything. I love both of my hyperlite bags, and I wouldn&apos;t consider another brand after my experience with the gear and the customer service. \nI&apos;ve had no issues with this bag so far, but my older daypack had a buckle break. They quickly sent a replacement.\nFor me, this bag handles every situation where I need more than a daypack, and it does so very well. It&apos;s expensive, but the material is tough and light. I&apos;ve spend plenty of time on rocks and strapping sharp and pointy things to the bag without any tears or visible damage. I still love that this is less than half the weight of my former overnight bag with a little extra capacity. Plus, you can just not roll the top if you need even more space. \n\nI love this bag and this brand!",

Process was quite straightforward, but did require re-adjustment of the cables as they stretched and allowing the pads to seat to the discs.  Once all set, I have excellent stopping power, and based on this, I am not convinced of the need for hydraulic brakes for road bikes.  I find mechanical brakes easier to work with, but it is noted that as the pads wear, one will need to manually adjust/advance the pad placement.  Whereas, hydraulics have the pistons advance as the pads wear.",

        "reviewBody": "Santini is a brand that definitely doesn&apos;t get the attention it deserves. The Unico bib is hands down one of the best pair of bibs that I have ever used. On the surface, there isn&apos;t much to set it apart from other bibs, but the combination of the small details is what makes the difference. The lack of seams on the legs of the bibs help them to disappear into the ride. The Chamois provides excellent long term support and comfort. The bib straps stretch comfortably over your shoulders and lay flat without bunching. These are a pair of bibshorts that you forget about while wearing them, never distracting you from your ride. I couldn&apos;t recommend them more.",

        "reviewBody": "Pack is super light and good, minimal features. The white color looks good (at least when new) but doesn&apos;t make sense. Using this in snow and ice (its intended purpose) means it can more easily get lost if you were to drop it or be stuck in a blizzard, and if someone is looking for you after an accident, it will be more difficult to find you. The color choice seems to be mimicking dyneema fibers (which can&apos;t be dyed and are white by necessity), but these packs are made of nylon, not dyneema. The pack carries well considering how light it is. I Have some durability concerns. After 1 climbing trip, there is already a small hole in the fabric at the bottom corner of the frame, presumably from scrambling over and down rocks. Lastly, the ice tool attachments have multiple issues: the metal tool clip at the bottom works fine but feels like the elastic cord holding it in place could break and it is connected to the other side, so you could potentially lose both tools if it snapped and it makes it more difficult to repair. Also, the top cord attachement for ice tools attaches to the shaft in 2 separate ways, one is very insecure and can just pop off (possibly sending your tool down the mountain; mine popped out of the top attachment and swung down/flipped over, luckily didn&apos;t come off); the other shaft securing option is to put the shaft through the loop of cord and tighten it with the spring loaded clamp. This is more secure but the spring clamp is not strong enough and it gradually loosens until the shaft is moving around by a few inches on the back of your pack.",

He heard a lot great things for this brand name and wanted a pair better than his entry level shoes. He is currently climbing indoor at V7-V8 level, 2-3 times a week. After 3 month regular use, the rubber already started to break at the front. One shoe has a hole, the other has a long line of cracks. I understand the running shoes need to be replaced much sooner than regular shoes. But I did not expect that it only lasted for 3 months. At this cost, I might need to try other brands.",

        "reviewBody": "3rd pair. I have worn 100&apos;s of different climbing shoes over the years and these stand out as one of the best.\n\nThe Stealth C4 rubber awesome. Haven&apos;t found a better rubber since they started making it decades ago.  Noticeably stickier than the Vibram options and it doesn&apos;t wear out quickly. I have Scapas and Spotivas and the tip wears much quicker. Even as it is wearing, it doesn&apos;t get all bumpy. It sort of wears sooth. The rubber also doesn&apos;t fold at the pressure points when standing on micro edges. A lot of softer rubbers bend and feel insecure on tiny holds. \n\nThe fit of the shoe is on the narrow side but the shoe is extremely soft and expands easily to form a suction cup around my foot. Everyone has a different foot shape and how they like their shoe to feel wrapped on their foot. These are a sock. Though they are super soft, there is a structure and the shoe is almost glued to my foot. It doesn&apos;t roll laterally, or slip forward when pulling in on steep toe pulls, or or back when heel hooking. I wear them super tight. Like v3 hard to pull on the first few times, but they do open up and get easier to get on. But for me, having the super snug fit is what I want in any performance shoes. I never size them to be worn around walking at all. I have other shoes for warming up and easier climbing. My street shoe is 9.5 and I get these in a 9. I could do a 9.5 and still have it perform well but in the 9 the juice is worth the squeeze. - I am a 41.5 in Scarpa Instinct and 40 in Sportiva Solutions for comparison. I guess if you have a wide foot, these aren&apos;t the best choice. \n\nThese shoes do edge really well for me. I need to feel what my feet are on to be confident on a hold. So, I prefer softer shoes. Even for trad and not super steep climbs. If you don&apos;t want to feel the holds, this is not the shoe. They smear amazing. toe hook amazing. I have worn the &quot;no edge&quot; shoes a lot and think these work similar but better all around. The HA Pro Comp do have a fairly aggressive toe down profile and fit. Which is a must for harder, steeper climbing. Even though it is aggressive, it feels comfortable and keeps it&apos;s suction throughout the life of the shoe. Probably because of the way the rubber is wrapped and pushes the toes forward and locks in the heel. \n\nI could go on but basically there are the best so far for me. If you ever wore the 5.10 Teams, these are a better version.",

It comes with a &quot;pump sack&quot; which is a nylon sack (about the size of a sleeping bag stuff sack) that attaches to the valve.  Closing the top of the sack and rolling it toward the valve pushes air from the sack into the pad.  You can also blow it up manually.  I haven&apos;t used it in the field yet, but it seems like it will be comfortable for 3 season use.",

FYI, the medium size is definitely small! at 66&quot; (5.5&apos;), I would not suggest it if you&apos;re any taller than me (it&apos;s also a bit narrow, which I don&apos;t mind since I don&apos;t move around much while I&apos;m sleeping). For a 5&apos;1 person, it works great. It&apos;s also no big deal, in my opinion, that this pad does not have the self-inflating feature??it&apos;s very easy to blow up. I didn&apos;t even see that it said &quot;self-inflating&quot; in the tech specs before purchasing. This pad is lightweight, only 1-2 R-value, and packs up pretty small. Although best as a summer pad, could definitely use this with a good sleeping bag and an extra layer under me during the colder months. Overall a good purchase.",

I did not use it on the whole period and still two days ago I would always woke up on the ground on a deflated mattress.

They stretch enough to form a bit to the movement of your legs.   There are great pockets and compartments that seal up watertight to store your phone and gear.  And best off they are not horribly hot and uncomfortable.   So far used them a week in Colorado in variable depths.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a storm chaser in Northcentral PA and had looked into reliable cell phone boosters for a while and decided to get the Sleek to see if this would help get more cell signal! It worked great up until a couple months ago. weBoost customer service was fantastic in replacing nearly 5 or 6 of the phone cradles due to a design defect that allowed the internal gears to cut power wires, and quickly sent out a new cradle. The defect was finally figured out and fixed and I then received one that was designed correctly and worked great! Unfortunately, now that my warranty ran out it appears as though my main unit has failed, or at least quit working. I&apos;ve used the app and there is no improvement in reception in poor cell areas when using the booster. I followed the directions multiple times over the last two months (just in case I did something wrong) while using the app and still nothing. While there is power to the unit and the cradle (white light turns on when plugged in) there is no improvement in my cell reception. In my area and as a storm chaser, reception means my safety. No reception means no radar, no comms and no way of uploading my media content, which means no way of working! I have tried rerouting my booster in my vehicle, even placing my outside antenna in a different spot on my roof with no difference. I like using the cradle so I still use an old one that I cut off the wire on. I&apos;m in the market for a different booster as I&apos;ve unfortunately not heard back after two attempts at emailing weBoost. Again, I understand my warranty ran out and I don&apos;t expect a free unit but I&apos;m surprised (maybe I shouldn&apos;t be?) this quit working as quickly as it did. I think this unit worked good for how small it is. It was able to get me service when I needed it, but in combination of the initial issues with the phone cradles and now the main unit not working and not hearing back from anyone, I can only give this product 2 stars. I&apos;m now in the market for a new, more powerful cell booster to help keep me connected while chasing natures most violent weather!",

That said, two issues that could break the deal: when it&apos;s snowy, the snow/ice comes into the visor and crusts it over. It&apos;s truly unusable in inclement weather, which you have to expect on nearly any day on the slopes. Other issue, the ear padding is so thick it&apos;s very difficult to hear conversation. I wanted some coverage for foul weather so ended up ripping out the padding while keeping the basic padding cover.",

The classic summer bike helmet just doesn&apos;t work in the wintertime as it&apos;s just too full of holes for ventilation. Enter the Smith Survey Snow helmet. It has enough ventilation to keep the visor from fogging, but not enough to make your head cold. It has better protection than ANY bike helmet. It keeps your ears warm without blocking exterior sounds. The flip up visor allows you to lift it up when needed even if you wear glasses like I do. The bright white color provides good riding visibility. In short, it&apos;s the best winter bike helmet I have found so far. Thanks, SMITH",

I do think there are a few places where the pack could be trimmed down as far as weight find in Gregory... But this is one of the few +75L bags I could find that checked the boxes for long winter multi-day trek. This is going with me to Aconcagua this February.",

We did the W trek in Chile and it worked great for all my gear like sleeping bag and everything we needed.  But because it is so large I over packed so make sure you are careful about that.  Rain cover is sold separately.  Bladder pack also separate.  No small daypack included either but you can add one or clip one on.",

I bought these on the recommendation that they might be a solution for bunion pain and I couldn’t agree more. When it comes to performance, I think they hit the mark and can certainly get the job done. I primarily use them for sport climbing.",

If they stretch at all they might get a little too large, though I think the straps will compensate.\nMy first time out with them was at a local quarry. These did exceptionally well on edges and pockets. I struggled to get up a slab and switched to my tried-and-true 5.10s. The Force V sole is too thick and stiff to effectively smear on really small slab features. But, to be fair, that&apos;s not what these shoes are designed for.\nI expect these will be become my go-to shoe for gym lead climbing. They edge well, the pointed toe should be good for pockets, the slightly aggressive downturn will be good on overhangs, the sole is sticky if not especially sensitive, and they&apos;re comfortable to wear for hours. I do wonder how they&apos;ll heal hook, though. Might have wished I had ordered the 44.5s.",

        "reviewBody": "I use this as a warmup shoe in the gym, but it is really versatile outdoors.  I got a 42.5, a somewhat comfy fit, have used them outdoors for granite single pitch and multi.  Comfy, durable leather, nice padding and split tongue, jams most crack sizes well.  No pressure I had them resoled with XS Grip for more smearing ability.  They work fine for sport, but do not edge closely, or pull or hook as well as a slipper or downturned shoe.  Sensitivity is not great, but the Force is solid on longer crack and face routes.\nScarpa rock shoes are def. snug for their Euro sizing.  I&apos;m about size 9.5 US street shoe, or 42.5, but Scarpa&apos;s 42.5 feels a full size smaller.  This is similar to Five-Ten sizing, yes?  They are both about a full Euro size smaller than La Sportiva rock shoes.",

I bought these in true size and at first they hurt really bad to wear but after a week or two they molded to my feet and feel very supportive with little to no pain. I wear them for about 2-3 hours at a time and they’re very comfortable shoes. Although I haven’t been able to wear these outdoors I really love these for recreational climbing and they’re prefect for crack climbing/ aggressive bouldering.",

A super sensitive sole that is also good enough to hold up and not flex when it isn’t needed. The amount of rubber on the toe box is great for toe hooks as well. Overall, so happy with the zenists.

The first time I bought them the stitching was all messed up and coming out, the Evolv team was kind enough to send me a new pair. Now these shoes are sensitive, so sensitive that once you get used to them every other shoe will feel like wearing a brick on your foot. They don’t have a ton to offer outdoors but are more than functional. The gym is where they shine, these shoes are bouldering machines. Who needs stiffness for support when you have so much sensitivity that you can just paste your foot over a chip and trust it. I love the easy on and off and the fit, they are durable and have lasted me over two years now. I look forward to trying the zenist pro with the new heel lock and closure system when my current zenist’s blow out. The black and white color way also looks soooo steezy.",

Works pretty well outdoors surprisingly (but I do still favor the phantoms for real rock), The toe rubber hooks very well, and the construction of the shoe it top notch. \r\nCONS: The one and only gripe I have is how poorly the heel fits my foot. I thought it was just me, but after talking to about 5 other members at my local gym that have the zenist…..they all have the same complaint! The heel is just SOO baggy and flimsy. \r\nSizing:\r\nA nice glove like fit down sizing a 1/2 size from my street shoe with toes fully curled. After one to two sessions the shoe felt broken in fully.\r\nMy foot is on the wider side with an egyptian toe shape and a “normal” shaped heel. \r\nI wouldn’t recommend down sizing any more than a 1/2 size.",

They smeared really well and the toe was really good even tho it wasn?t padded that much they performed better on bathangs than my x1. And one other thing I loved about these shoes was the heel they basically hugged my heel and ankles no dead space in them I would recommend if you are looking for a soft indoor shoe. You can wear them outside but they are so soft that they would wear down quickly if you wear them outside but they can sure take a beating",

I tripped over my poles last year and bent one to the point I could no longer use it. I went and purchased the new version of the Z pole. 3 times I have returned them under warranty and received a new pair. The push button used to hold the pole straight and used to release the pole to fold broke on each of the 3 set I used. It took me until my 3rd set of poles to figure out that the poles worked perfectly in dry weather, however after wet hikes, even though I did my best to dry to poles out, the mechanism became stiff and then failed completely. Black Diamon, please fix the change you made so the metal inside survives damp conditions.",

These are snug at the instep if you have “taller” feet; it took a few wears to start to feel comfortable, and takes a shoe horn every time to get them on. Surprisingly roomy at toe box (which is where my width is). Learher and construction seem good. Cork later at the sole makes these a bit more casual, but colorwise, plays well with all the neutrals.  Good looking for a casual boot. Squeaky for first day, then not again. Haven’t tested waterproofing yet.",

        "reviewBody": "Love these hiking boots.  Fits true to size and comfortable without break-in.  I have very wide feet and usually wear 4e when I can get it.  The wide version of Moab feels great.  Also, surprisingly, they are incredibly easy to put on - I can just about step into them without struggling or using a shoehorn.  I was not expecting this -  it is a major selling point! I have taken them on several hikes now, and I feel stable on dirt, loose stone, tree branches, up-hill, down-hill, etc. The mid height is perfect for hiking, and the weight is very reasonable.  I have some much heavier leather boots that aren&apos;t as easy to hike with.  I don&apos;t really need the waterproofing I think in most cases, so I went the middle route by getting the standard waterproofing and not the gor-tech. This works great for light water exposure and i have yet to feel any moisture get through.  I don&apos;t normally write reviews, but I have so much trouble getting boots that fit comfortably due to my foot width.  Most wide shoes are either on a last that doesn&apos;t work well with my feel or are only &quot;slightly&quot; wider than normal D width.  Those shoes cause me significant pain, almost from the moment I put them on.  I have no pain walking in these.  The insoles are also pretty comfortable.  Also, these were on sale when I bought them, so I feel like I got a great value.  If you have wide feet and don&apos;t like to struggle to put on your boots, just buy these!",

I tend to size up and go with a wide for hiking purposes because I like to wear a thicker sock and my foot swells on longer hikes. The mid-rise boot provides excellent support and decent water resistance. I do not require any break in time with the Moab. They are extremely comfortable right out of the box. I do have custom orthotics that I prefer to the insole that comes with the boot, but can go with or without. The boot holds up well to abuse. I hike an average of 5 miles a day. Mostly off trail - scrambling, sand, bushwhacking and rocky terrain. I am able to handle steep descents without my toes hurting.   I have purchased both mid rise and low Moab’s as gifts for friends and family. They all agree that it is a very comfortable choice. I normally wear gaiters to keep as much debris as possible from entering the shoe.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the boot does not do a very good job keeping sand from entering the boot.",

I wear it for my entire ice climbing season and it keeps me plenty warm. I also like that it doesn&apos;t need to be washed frequently and the fabric does not smell despite use on long trips. The hoodie comes over my helmet which is a big need met as I don&apos;t like wearing beanies under my helmet.

I like how comfortable it is to wear while around the house in our cool PNW climate or at the summit when it gets cooler while on a trip.  I like this jacket so much I had to get a second one in red, the Alert Heather color.  These are somewhat form fitting but not too light for me and super comfortable. I like how long it is in the back. This jacket looks nice you can wear it around town too.\n\nThe thickness of this jacket is thinner than the Monkey Woman Grid Fleece jacket.  Which makes it great for layering under down jackets.  The fleece part of the Monkey Woman Grid Fleece is fluffier and thicker than the power grid. But the features are similar. I am still majorly in LOVE with the monkey woman grid fleece also and hope it will come back someday!",

I have not yet used it heavily to be able to comment on durability, but I can say that it feels very well made, solid stitching, quality materials, etc. The details in the design are excellent as well; from the thumb holes in the sleeves to the tightness and shape of the hood, you can tell that it was very thoughtfully designed with an active, outdoorsy user in mind. \n\nOne thing worth considering is the length of the sweater. I suspect is engineered this way to stay under a harness, but I am 5&apos;9&quot; and would be happy with it an inch or two shorter. For shorter folks and/or those with short torsos, it may feel too long depending on your personal preferences.\n\nThe sizing feels about perfect. I would say it is a snug large, which is perfect for me as I tend to be smack dab in the middle of the two sizes. My body measurements for reference 40-32/33-40-ish.",

This is a bit of a deal breaker for me as quicklace is more secure and less fuss to adjust on the trails. The colourways could use a bit of work as well. The choices are more road runner. Trail Runners are more about dirt, mud, etc. A little darker colours with a splash of brighter colour would be great. Love Salomon, loyal to the brand, just a few tweaks and a great shoe.",

They were very comfortable right out of the box and easy to run in. The only downside is I have to tie it in a certain way ie pretty tight not to have my heel feel loose. It does feel though that my feet are sort of sinking into the shoe as the weeks go on, so hopefully that will get better. These seem much better made than a lot of other trail running shoes in terms of the fabric and construction and I’m excited to try more.",

        "reviewBody": "These are perfectly adequate bibs for a short to medium distance casual or training ride.  To be entirely fair to Giordana, if that’s what you want them for, then for sure give them a shot.  There are however, some big differences between these and higher end bibs, whether in the Giordana range, or from competitor brands.\n\nFirst, the positives.  The chamois itself is quite nice.  It isn’t quite to the level of the FR-C Pro, but is still comfortable and supportive without feeling Iike a diaper.  The fabric for the legs is also comfortable, though again, with a very casual feel.\n\nBig areas of opportunity exist when it comes to the leg grippers, waist band, and bib straps, in my opinion.  The leg grippers are almost entirely ineffective on these bibs and I find myself adjusting the end of the legs multiple times per ride.  The waist band is cut quite a bit lower than some of Giordana’s other bibs, which for me manifests in uncomfortably cutting into my stomach while riding.  Last, but not least, the straps are a very weak elastic material that does not provide any real tension - perhaps if the straps were more robust the wait cutting in wouldn’t be an issue as I generally have to hike the shorts up mid-ride.\n\nIt is worth noting that I already own 5 pair of Giordana FR-C Pro bibs and ordered these in the same exact size.  The compression is far lower on the legs and again, the bib straps themselves are far less robust and effective.  Perhaps if I sized down they would be better, but that’s also frustrating to wear different sizes in the same brand.  Ultimately these are nice enough, but even at a reduced price compared to the higher tier FR-C Pro versions I don’t think are worth the money.  There are much better bibs available at the same price point or lower than these.",

They remind me a bit of upper line Assos models \n      \nI&apos;ve heard from many reviews here, YouTube,  and other places that Giordana silverline are the BEST sub $200 shorts available.  From seeing them I have to agree (so far) from inspecting them in person. \n\nI&apos;m going to start using them and I will update this review after a few months of using them. \n\nBtw, I got them in navy blue, I like that there are no loud 1990&apos;s logos, they are very good looking,  and much more expensive looking than they are.",

The unique lining is soft and incredibly warm. The retro cinch straps work great, and the gloves are a beauty to behold.  I haven&apos;t put them through the ringer yet, but I have worn them on half dozen occasions on cold leisure walks and so far they have met/exceeded expectations.",

They quickly processed a replacement for me. However, the second pair arrived and is a very different color/leather texture/consistency (fingers are all the same length, at least!).  \n\nI realize quality leather products generally have inconsistencies from item to item, but the difference here is pretty stark, as the first pair was quite smooth and the second is very wrinkly. \n\nCurious if this is a known Hestra issue, if Backcountry has a “bad batch”, or what. I have been waiting to hear back after calling them again, guess we’ll see!",

I&apos;ve had them out during PNW downpours and they shed water really well and I like the fit.\r\nI have 1620 single and double front, Mtn Khaki, Kuhl and Arborwear pants. I spend a lot of days out in all conditions. These are my go-to pants unless it&apos;s properly cold out. They&apos;re lighter than any of the cotton canvas pants and less restrictive. I also like that the  thigh pockets all have snap closures so that what&apos;s in your pockets stays in your pockets.\r\nThe new sizing scheme is cut a little smaller, so if you know what size you wear in Fjallravens, size up one. 50 was perfect for me before and 52 fits the same as the 50 did.",

        "reviewBody": "I have wanted a pair of Vidda Pros for a while and finally took the plunge. I am a 34&quot; waist in my Carhartt cargos so I ordered a 34. They arrived a week later and were way too small so I returned them and found a shop which had some Greenland jeans which were a perfect fit in a 36 so I bought them and ordered a pair of Viddas in 36. Another week passes, they arrive and again, too small! The legs were snug but fitted well but the waist was about an inch short. I sent them back and ordered a 38. Another week later they arrive, generous but ok in the waist but the legs creased in odd places and the knee shape stuck out and looked really odd. I figured they might be better after a wash but they didn&apos;t change. So now I will have to sell them as used, I still don&apos;t have any Fjallraven work trousers and I&apos;m really confused about the sizing. I get the impression that they would fit an athletic body shape very well and be a great trouser for years. However, any other body shape and the &quot;fit&quot; doesn&apos;t really fit.",

        "reviewBody": "The quality of these trousers is immediately apparent when you first put them on. Stitching, hardware, pockets, and all the little details feel very well made and constructed. That being said, I would highly recommend you size up in the waist. The G-1000 material on these trousers is not meant to stretch, so the 44 (29&quot;) fits very tight around the waist and thighs. For reference, I am 5&apos;6&quot; / 140-150lbs and usually wear size 29/30 pants. A 46 (30&quot;) offers more room but definitely feels a little large. If you&apos;re going to order these online make sure you&apos;re prepared to make a return or exchange - can&apos;t stress enough how odd the sizing is.",

Even in 30-35F days I don’t find this jacket to be all that warm unless I’m relatively active or wearing a HEAVY mid layer. Realizing that this was designed to be as light weight as possible, I can appreciate the sleek unbulky feel though. It looks and feels really good. When wearing while doing something pretty active in the high teens or warmer it’s fine.  If you need to pack it, the low weight and small pack size is great. Wish MH had a jacket of this quality with slightly more insulation but it looks like the next step up is a full blown parka. Bought this to replace an old tattered TNF Morph jacket which was similarly priced with 800 fill down but still find myself grabbing for it over the Ghost Whisperer if it’s in the 20’sF.  A bit overpriced for how much insulation is in it imo but a decent buy if you plan to primarily use for highly active situations or plan to wear heavy layers underneath.",

It is extremely lightweight but he says it keeps him plenty warm. It fits snug enough to wear under a shell. He has a Mountain Hardware shell that fits over it perfectly. When we got the jacket in the mail there were a few places where we found loose threads. We cut those off and I don’t believe he’s found anymore. He had to let it sit out for a few days to fluff up a bit after it was in the shipping box.",

Ive worn this jacket on long, freezing cold photoshoots in the ice and snow; ive worn it boating down freezing rivers at 20 degrees. The jacket is easy to mend with a little aquaseal, it takes less than one minute (not mtn. hardware recommended i doubt but it works for mine).  There isnt a jacket made that&apos;s equals this items warmth to weight ratio. The fact you can wear a t-shirt in 20 degree weather and stay warm and dry speaks to the quality. I own both the OG ghost whisperer and the Ghost 2 w/hood. This is the first product ive written a review about, it&apos;s that good. Mtn hardware.  warranty is awesome. my OG jacket needed a new zipper- mtn hardware had it back to me in a week or two, no charge. Buy it.",

        "reviewBody": "For starters I live in Montana, it&apos;s cold. Like really cold. This jacket rips, I&apos;ll wear it 20 degree weather with nothing but a t-shirt under it. Currently -5 here, I&apos;m wearing it with a hoodie under it never been warmer. I ski in this thing nonstop, I have a shell on the outer layer and that&apos;s it. I&apos;ve skied it in 30 degree weather, in -10 degree weather, no matter this bad boy keeps heat in and cold out. Plus this is the lightest jacket imaginable, it folds down into a tiny little pocket which makes it brilliant for camping/hiking. It looks sharp and is my go to jacket everyday here. \r\n\r\nIt&apos;s warm, looks great, and regulates heat perfectly. My only complaint is the torso length, it&apos;s about 1-2 inches shorter than I would like it to be, but it&apos;s still long enough to be tucked into my ski pants. I am 6&apos;3 about 185 and the arms are the perfect length and i have no issues layering underneath or on top of this. I usually only need one layer underneath this if it&apos;s frigid out, I can&apos;t really see a situation where I would need more than one midlayer. \r\n\r\nI can&apos;t recommend this jacket enough, if you&apos;re gonna buy a higher end down jacket this is the one. Price tag is worth it, you&apos;ll never buy another jacket.",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased Scarpa Vapor climbing shoes for the first time recently. I was initially very impressed with the shoes. They were comfortable out of the box and performed exceptionally. However, I only used them a handful of times and they already have a hole in the toe through the leather. Generally, I have been able to get several months of use from my climbing shoes and am able to resole them a few times before the wear is too damaged. It seems that the Vapor has a design flaw in that the toe rand comes to a narrow point with a small gap in the rubber where the leather is exposed. I contacted Scarpa warranty directly but they did not stand behind their product. Very disappointing.",

Well here is a picture after wearing the shoe 3 times! 3!!! \n\nnow the length I wore then was all about an hour. Just noticed this after an hour at a dog park. Nothing strenuous what so ever. Got these as a B day present 29th of September and it&apos;s now Oct 5th.\n\nVery disappointed to say the least 😕",

The laces come across the top of my foot restricting the blood flow to my feet, so my toes tingle.  I recently went on a 2.5 mile hike and my shins are sore, which is something I&apos;ve never felt even when backpacking 10 miles or more in other shoes.  My arches in my feet are equally sore which only happens in these shoes.  Also, I can see the fabric inside the shoe is already wearing out from my heel.  I read a previous review of someone with a similar experience but he was walking 4 or 5 miles a day, which I am not.",

I also have high arches, and currently the similar options I have tried from Lowa, Hoka, Salomon and Keen have all been winners!!  Feel free to reach out to a Gearhead to talk about exchanging your shoes, we&apos;d be happy to help make sure you get in the right pair!!",

My other one didn&apos;t have an aluminum shaft and I&apos;m not crazy over the aluminum. It arrived dented and feel very thin so I&apos;m sure it will get dented even more. It doesn&apos;t effect the usability but I was still bummed to received a damaged product. I have a sit on top kayak that I use for slow moving rivers and lakes and the paddle works well.",

The two &quot;dents&quot; are in the right hand shaft only which happened when Carlisle pressed the aluminum shaft to give that section an oval shape so you can hold the paddle at the correct angle when paddling."

Decently comfortable for a hanging belay, too. Adjustment straps work well. Padding is comfy. When I wore out the previous model, I bought this one and don’t notice any discernible changes besides the color (which frankly I don’t love, but I love everything else about this harness so I’ll grin and bear the weird violet/mauve…).

They kept me looking amazing with my Snowcrew Anarak coat! These pants stretch so carving and getting on and off a lift were not an issue. The adjustable sides, keep pants on and snug. The pockets are great and kept my phone dry. Way to go! I am hooked and will wear this brand from now on.",

Even able to pack them in a stuff sack. The waist cinch is def one of the best I&apos;ve seen. I typically would be a 3x, except when I tried them on it hurt to sit down. No give. They would have been perfect for skiing and being upright. So I went with the 4x because I had largely purchase for a buggy tour where I would be sitting down for multiple hours. They are way too big in the waist though. And too long for me, I&apos;m 5&apos;5&quot;. I keep stepping on the bottom part. Otherwise quality is fantastic.",

Unfortunately, when I tried them on, I realized that I would need either a 36&quot; or 37&quot; size.\n\nI?ve just measured my waistline with a string &amp; yardstick (obviously should have done this before ordering), and it is about 37.25&quot; ? so I suppose maybe Gap &amp; Uniqlo have flattering sizing, while Patagonia is probably more scientifically accurate.\n\nAlso notable: the cut of these is not really &quot;slim fit&quot; in the sense I am used to. The thigh area seems pretty tight, while the lower legs are pretty loose. I prefer a more tapered cut for comfort, biking, &amp; aesthetics.\n\nSo, I guess maybe I?ll try again, but perhaps with a different pair of Patagonias at a larger size.",

All the rain water from 2 roads drained into our site; within 15 minutes the tent was sitting in 2-3 inches of water, after 30 min there was 6 inches.  Even with all of our gear, high winds, thunder and lighting all around there were ZERO leaks with the rainfly in place.  Highly recommend this tent.  Highest quality and great price for a 4 season tent!",

The “Arche Rock Pants”, according to a very helpful person in Consumer Service, are the closest match. \nI like the pants but I’d prefer a light soft lining which the Holly pants have and a softer outside material which probably is less water resistant. The Arche Rock pants have a thin material with no lining and they rustle when I walk. Maybe some of the stiffness will decrease over time.\nThe navy color and the fit are fine but the length a bit short I’m 5’6” 135lbs and size 8.",

The pre-seasoned griddle had to be washed with soap before its first use, and even then ive had to resort to trying to bake off the adhesive. For the price of this griddle I would have thought BioLite would have used a less destructive adhesive for its label on cast iron.",

These liners are simple, yet just right and honestly that&apos;s exactly what I want in my MTB liners. The legs don&apos;t ride up and also don&apos;t cut into my legs, the chamois is comfy, and the fabric is super nice. If they had cargo pockets, they would quickly become my go-to for every ride.",

I could see them being used by XC Riders, and specifically long all day trail riding...which leads to how I found them. I have been gearing up for some long bike packing routes and races and needed something that could handle days of riding, a loaded bike, and not bunch and bind like every other liner, bib, chamois, I have ever used does. These are perfect. Almost like they aren&apos;t there at all, except pain on my sit bones doesn&apos;t exist. These are so good, I ordered a second one. After spending 6+ hours on one ride in the saddle, with zero issues, I don&apos;t even want to try another bib liner for all day riding and touring.",

When sitting up you?re right on the seam and I can?t possibly imagine the aero position one would need to be in use the front portion.

The fit is a little boxy and sleeves a bit on the long side but this is a minor issue for the price and otherwise has the euro fit you want. Looks stylish and classy when zipped up and dries quickly if you get a bit sweaty as the day warms up. This is an insulation layer: Not windproof or waterproof so careful pairing with baselayer or vest is required. Bought it in the grey, size medium.",

I wore a thin, short sleeved base + thin, long sleeved base. I didn’t feel restricted/constricted regarding movement. Initially, the ride was much uphill. Only briefly did I feel too warm. For the descent, I was comfortable. Probably, could have gotten by with  1 (better, thicker) base layer.  I would agree with other reviews stating that the sleeves are a little long, but I just rolled them over my gloves and that was a good enough.  Because of the breezy conditions, I always prefer the form fit from Castelli which a M shirt sleeve delivers,  but not so much this one. Overall, a good cold weather option that I would recommend.  For a sizing comparison, I also purchased a similar M - size Gore product,  but it was a little too big.",

On my last ride temps were 33-54°, it never felt hot, damp, or stuffy. I would buy a 2nd.\n The full width chest reflective strip is nice for early starts.

I guess this helps accommodate base layers underneath but it was excessive for me and I returned it.

        "reviewBody": "Great all around jacket for cold days, still or active, city to backcountry. It has a lot to offer in this mere 10oz and quite packable piece. With ease of movement the jacket’s integrated elastic cords grapple your waist and will hold on to your wrists so you won’t have to worry about the jackets riding up your arm or chest while in heavy activity. The wind proofing is substantial while surprisingly rain will wet out the face fabric…however the moreno Swiss wool stayed warm when wet and did not take long to dry out. \n\nFun fact; This swisswool jacket out of Romania is covered by the Ortovox Wool Promise. Expect excellent, odor repellent, moisture management for such a great warmth to weight ratio of 90 g/m2 (chest and back); 60g/m2 (sleeves and sides) AND rest assured these European sheep are being carefully sought after with excellent Tasmanian farmers.",

However, the thing I love about this is that the Dometic DC plug for the coolers can twist lock into this device so it can&apos;t pop out on the road.  Which is worth every penny.\r\n\r\nSo I ordered it for that reason, but I have to say, this kits is excellent.  The wire that comes with it is super high quality heavy gauge and completely (loomed) or covered to protect itself, it made install the power to our built in cooler in our Jeep Wrangler TJ twice as easy as it would have been.   Plus i get the extra power port at the back of the vehicle which is handy.\r\n\r\nWorth it for the twist lock connection!  Worth it for the excellent and very long heavy gauge wiring harness!",

Turns out the boots stretched at least a size and a half after using them for 3/4 days, and now they are way too big. I found them to be extraordinarily heavy as well, compared to what one might assume by looking at the pictures. I was not impressed with lack of support and the lack of feeling stable in the boot, but as I mentioned, the boots stretched terribly after using them for 4 days.",

        "reviewBody": "I live in SoCal and the few remaining trout waters here are a serious hike to get into (steep descents/even rappelling into canyons). I like wading boots for wet wading with neoprene socks when I finally make it down the canyon, but have never liked wading boots for the approach and return (generally squishy, heavy and ill-fitting). After my previous Simms boots fell apart I splurged and got these. Man, the Simms/Danner River Salt boots are great. I?ve used them the past two days and seriously felt like I was wearing good hiking boots with ankle support even on the way back up. We?ll see how these last long-term but the initial impression is very positive, looking for the next excuse to wear them. Purchased 10, normally 9.5, fit is tight/solid with neoprene socks. Question, is there a leather conditioner I should use?",

The Base Charge 1500 saved us for the first few days.  I was able to make coffee--for my entire neighbor hood--for the first 3 days. I made coffee (grinder and espresso machine) and toast for a week without having to recharge.  We eventually got a generator for our freezer and fridge as the power outage went on for a week, but the Biolite was absolutely the best.  I was more than impressed and. as a coffee afficianado,  it saved my life. I highly recommend this.",

        "reviewBody": "After a year and a half going through multiple pairs of Tenaya Oasi LV, I finally jumped on the novelty train with the Indalo. I do love the low volume version of the Oasi but they are ridiculously hard to find in mens sizing despite being marketed as unisex. Having somewhat narrow foot shape in relation to length, I had never found a trusty fit in unlaced shoes until Oasi LV. Luckily, not only is Indalo a step up in construction quality and details, at half a size down (US 9 versus 9.5 in Oasi LV) the newest member of Tenaya is an almost ideal fit! The comfort, too, is right up there, despite feeling a touch more assertive and supportive on edges.  It also breathes better thanks to some nifty mesh paneling under the tongue. Really, they are both stellar shoes and I am flabbergasted that hardly any brick and mortars carry them jn Minnesota. Bigger brands must have the market pretty cornered when even REI only ever stocks thd Mundaka (way, way too wide for guys like me). Hoping for better availability and wider support for the folks at Tenaya.",

I like to hit the ski area late in the day, do a half dozen runs and ski up the mountain after they close.  Makes a nice way to spend an evening and at times you have the mountain mostly to yourself.",

I bought the men’s version because I preferred the triple black colorway and the subtle design differences to the upper. They feel like wearing supportive dance shoes, super natural like a barefoot walking feeling. Nothing rubs or moves around. I love the super low profile of the upper and the outsole. They look really graceful not chunky or outdoorsy. I have bunions and these feel great! As far as sizing if any other women are thinking of purchasing these, I recommend measuring your foot in cm and following the Japanese sizing system. These are on the smaller end of my shoe size range but that’s relative to other brands which aren’t necessarily trustworthy anyway.",

I got a size M and I&apos;m 6&apos;2 220lbs, and it still runs a bit puffy, but there is a hem drawcord to bring the bottom of the jacket in. My only complaint is that the thumb holes in the cuff need to be a bit further out. My arms aren&apos;t exceptionally long, and any reaching down really strains the thumb hole. Definitely not a deal breaker, just means you&apos;ve gotta bend a little more to futz with the boots or bindings. Oh and I&apos;ve had exactly 0 issues with the zipper.",
