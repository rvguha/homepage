He has been successful and is doing this from the concern he has developed for his country.\n\nIt covers many aspects and unlike michael moore, he is not approaching this from a partisan viewpoint. He was very balanced and bipartisan, simply approaching these terrible realities from the viewpoint of a genuine person who cares about the decline of a great nation.\n\nThis film was good. The content was substantiated and he built a good case... I think anyone who cares at all about their future as a US citizen, and the future of their children should watch this movie.\n\nWatch it , bring your friends....",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Til We Meet Again is a remake of Warner Brothers earlier film, One Way Passage, a story of doomed romance that starred William Powell and Kay Francis. This film and the previous one concerns the shipboard romance of a man being brought back to the United States in custody to face the gas chamber in San Quentin and a terminally ill woman on a cruise for one last fling at life. Taking the parts of Powell and Francis are George Brent and Merle Oberon.\n\nI can see Jack Warner&apos;s mind at work on this one. The year before George Brent had romanced and treated the terminally ill Bette Davis in Dark Victory. Why not get Brent into a remake of this other film about a dying woman and her last romance? We even get Geraldine Fitzgerald in this one in the same part, best friend to the terminally ill woman.\n\nThe part of the police lieutenant escorting Brent is built up considerably from One Way Passage where the role was played by Warren Hymer. Here Pat O&apos;Brien is the cop and he&apos;s nobody&apos;s fool. Still Brent has friends on board, Frank McHugh who&apos;s a con man with a nice drunk act and Binnie Barnes who&apos;s a con woman with a phony French accent. She goes after O&apos;Brien and not totally in the line of duty. She&apos;s also my favorite in this film.\n\nOberon and Brent make a beautiful pair of lovers and one had better have as big a supply of handkerchiefs as one did in watching One Way Passage.",

They are placed in a booby-trapped house that is slowly filling up with a lethal nerve gas. They are doomed to die, unless they can find out what they have in common, complete various tasks in the house and find the antidote.\n\nWhere the original film&apos;s gore could be forgiven on the account of its high logic, this lazy sequel is just gore for its own sake. The pace has been slowed down to a snail&apos;s and there are fewer scares and twists to keep the viewer as interested. Nevertheless, few viewers will have worked out the final, nasty twist, which makes it all worthwhile.",

I&apos;m just bored tbh.\n\nI won&apos;t vote it a zero out of ten cuz I&apos;m not that kinda person yk.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of effort put into this so I acknowledge that much.\n\nBut still, I&apos;m not really a fan. Movie could&apos;ve been better.\n\nAlso I don&apos;t like war stuff and things about weapons so that might influence my opinions tbh.\n\nYes so thanks for reading my review. K bye.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Jhumroo&quot; is a classic Bollywood musical film released in 1961. Directed by Shankar Mukherjee, the movie features Kishore Kumar and Madhubala in the lead roles, along with Lalita Pawar, Jayant, and Anoop Kumar in supporting roles. Known for its entertaining music and Kishore Kumar&apos;s charismatic performance, &quot;Jhumroo&quot; remains a beloved film among fans of Hindi cinema.\n\nThe story revolves around the life of a carefree young man named Bhola (played by Kishore Kumar), who dreams of becoming a successful singer. However, due to his lack of talent, he faces constant rejection. Bhola&apos;s life takes an unexpected turn when he meets his look-alike, a wealthy businessman named Mannohar (also played by Kishore Kumar). Bhola decides to take advantage of this resemblance and takes on Mannohar&apos;s identity. He moves into Mannohar&apos;s lavish mansion and tries to navigate his new lifestyle while also pursuing his dream of becoming a singer. Along the way, he encounters various comedic situations and romantic entanglements.\n\nOne of the highlights of &quot;Jhumroo&quot; is its music, composed by Kishore Kumar himself. The film features several popular songs, including the evergreen tracks &quot;Main Hoon Jhumroo&quot; and &quot;Koi Humdum Na Raha.&quot; Kishore Kumar&apos;s energetic and soulful renditions, combined with catchy melodies, add a lot of charm to the film. The music remains memorable even after all these years and is often remembered as one of the film&apos;s strongest aspects.\n\nThe performances in &quot;Jhumroo&quot; are another standout feature. Kishore Kumar, who was not only a talented singer but also a versatile actor, delivers a stellar performance in dual roles. His comic timing and ability to switch between the characters of Bhola and Mannohar are commendable. Madhubala, known for her grace and beauty, complements Kishore Kumar&apos;s performance with her charm and screen presence.\n\nThe film&apos;s direction by Shankar Mukherjee is competent, keeping the narrative engaging and lighthearted. The screenplay, although somewhat predictable, is well-paced and offers a good mix of comedy, romance, and drama. The dialogues are witty, contributing to the film&apos;s overall entertainment value.\n\nAs with many movies from that era, &quot;Jhumroo&quot; has its fair share of melodrama and exaggerated comedic moments, which may not appeal to everyone&apos;s taste. However, it remains a delightful watch for fans of vintage Bollywood cinema, offering a glimpse into the golden era of Hindi musical films.\n\nOverall, &quot;Jhumroo&quot; is a classic Bollywood entertainer that showcases the talents of Kishore Kumar as an actor and a singer. With its memorable music, engaging performances, and light-hearted storyline, the film continues to be cherished by fans of Hindi cinema, making it a must-watch for lovers of vintage Bollywood movies.",

The acting is ok and direction is not anything special but competent.  Stars Sharon Stone before she became known for her infamous role in Basic Instinct(1992).  The film seems to have suffered some cuts that were not the director&apos;s choice. I would love to see someone unearth a director&apos;s cut of Deadly Blessing(1981) with an alternate ending if such exists.  Ernest Borgine replays the kind of person he played in The Devil&apos;s Rain(1975).  A hard to find Craven pic that is in need of a DVD release by someone who cares about good horror pics.  Deadly Blessing(1981) is a good feature film that has its share of flaws and could have used a better lead actress than the one used in the film.  Has some daring aspects that were typical of Wes Craven during this stage of his career.  The best and my favorite scene of the film involves a snake in a bathtub while a woman takes a bath."

Quick action sequences, no shots that goes in slow motion and focuses on the flow of the hair kind of effects. The characters are so-so. I will not say that they are overly interesting but they don&apos;t distract from the story either. \n\nThe best part of the movie for me was how it actually caught me off guard. The plot twist actually made me laugh as I never saw it coming and I thought I have seen it all in martial art movies.\n\nThere are some parts that are funny some that are sexy. parts that are exciting and parts that are wholesome. I really recommend this movie. Don&apos;t let the rather formulaic and somewhat confusing opening throw you off. Its good :)",

      "reviewBody": "I grabbed the DVD off of the local Blockbuster new release shelf. One shouldn&apos;t judge a book (or film) by the DVD cover, but I guess I&apos;m a sucker for a hot-blonde in military uniform. I knew not to expect too much of it, and, well, that&apos;s kind of what the viewer got, but there was a bit more here than meets the eye.\n\nYears back when Goldie Hawn did Private Benjamin there was a lot of hype about the comic and comedic overtones of &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;. But, it turned out to be a serious film with humor sprinkled in here and there. &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; was funny, but it wasn&apos;t light entertainment. It had some social commentary and other messages to convey to the audience. In this regard I was personally let down by &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;, although I understand it as a quality film, and appreciate it as such.\n\n&quot;Private Valentine&quot;, on the other hand, is cut from a different cloth. It takes the Goldie Hawn film, removes the heavy undercurrent meat and replaces it with a light frothy soufflé. Jessica Simpson doesn&apos;t play the heavily laden woman nearing a conjuncture in her life, and is taken in by a more than slick military ad campaign. Simpson&apos;s character starts off as a lightweight star who wants to be taken seriously, but is not given the opportunity because of both the roles she&apos;s given, and the deeper reason of why she&apos;s given said roles. It takes Uncle Sam to turn her into &quot;An army of one&quot;, so to speak. And a one-woman wrecking crew she becomes.\n\nUnlike Private Benjamin, the Cold War is over, so there&apos;s no &quot;Red menace&quot; and/or scare to play off of. The sexual tension in this film is kept light and romantic, as opposed to the expose on abuse that Hawn&apos;s film portrayed. In short, it&apos;s light entertainment. &quot;Private Valentine&quot; is meant to be nothing more than that.\n\nHaving said this, and having a loose and tacit respect for this film, I do admit that it could have been executed better, particularly in the first act. The beginning of the film seems cobbled together, and not thoroughly vetted as it could have been. The whole movie seems to have been a bargain production, though not quite as low as a B-movie extravaganza. As such the exposition and staging are somewhat restrained.\n\nJessica Simpson herself is actually quite good in this role. In fact, everyone does a good job, but I was particularly impressed with Simpson&apos;s acting ability, and this comment comes from a man who is not one of her fans. There was no heavy emoting to be doe here, but Simpson did show us a diverse set of acting abilities. If the directing had been tightened up a little, then this film, Simpson included, could have really shined and exceeded all expectations.\n\nAs it stands now it&apos;s just light entertainment. Don&apos;t expect a remake of &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;, because it really isn&apos;t. It takes the premise of that film, and, in a sense, turns it on its head to create something mildly enjoyable, and not overly wrought with social commentary, drama and character angst.\n\nNot a great film, but then it was never meant to be one. Just something to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. If you go in not expecting too much, then you should be okay with it. The only warning I&apos;d give is that it&apos;s a proverbial chick-flick. So, to my fellow testosterone comrades, try not to be overly critical of it.\n\nGive it a shot."

      "reviewBody": "Denmark, strictly geographically, doesn&apos;t belong to Scandinavia, but only to Northern Europe. However, the language, the history, the culture, the mentality of people and so many other things are so similar to Norwegians and Swedes that many of us simply ignore Kattegat and Skagerrak who divide Denmark and Sweden, and include the former in Scandinavian group of countries (as well as Finland, what is also wrong).\n\nAnd, as for the movies, there hasn&apos;t been a great difference which of these countries they came from. Many directors and actors haven&apos;t been limited to their own cinematography. Co-productions were and still are usual, common way of making movies. And their movies, no matter which country was main in production, have always been recognizable, different from the rest of Europe, let alone America. Usually this different was equal to better, especially in some genres like dramas (particularly social and political ones) or family movies. Russian, Czech or French authors when inspired could reach them in movies about children, but Scandinavian movies always kept high standards.\n\nHowever, about a decade ago Danish movies started to change. Their northern neighbors kept their originality, style, quality, courage and still make movies like Ikke naken, Misa mi, Före stormen, but Danish directors seem to turn their eyes to west, across the Atlantic. It looks as if they make movies for American market (hoping for a call to follow Lasse Halström). Klatretosen was a typical example: an adventure being far beyond believable, children making successfully things that adults don&apos;t even try to do, everything so clean to pass American censorship, speed of the action being the most important content in making the plot... As if made by authors of Goonies, Spy Kids etc. Some other modern Danish movies accept modern American culture and attitudes as their own, or show kids who adore American heroes (Drommen).\n\nFakiren fra Bilbao goes even further. The place is unrecognizable (haunted castle reminds on England though), and all the character names are English or at least sound that way, except if their nationality is important to the plot. As if this would make the movie even more acceptable to Academy nominating comitee. But, weird, the movie isn&apos;t dubbed: the European market got the Danish language version, and I wouldn&apos;t mind listening to English in such hollywoodised movie (I watched some other Scandinavian movies that were typically local - like Ronja, Sofia&apos;s verden etc - in English or German versions).\n\nUsually Scandinavian movies are either very realistic (most of them) or fairy tales. Fakiren fra Bilbao authors couldn&apos;t decide: the basic plot is very realistic until a new character, magician Lombardo, is introduced after some one third of the movie. And this is not a SF premise like the one in Eternal Sunshine (partial memory erasing), but some magic stuff with explanations too unconvincing ever for pre-school kids. But, maybe, believable to target population - Hollywood products consumers.\n\nThis movie is not so bad as my comment might seem to be. The camera work is great, and the mood that is developed in many scenes can much better than many rich, respectable productions for adults achieved. Julie Zangenberg looks and acts similar to Klatretosen, what is good, but she shouldn&apos;t repeat herself for too long. Aksel Leth acts as if he comes from Malcolm in the Middle or some other American sitcom (but this wooden acting suits the character). Adult actors, especially Ole Thestrup, push movie from adventure to comedy, what abates flaws in the plot.\n\nConclusion: you can watch it, your kids can watch it, but neither of you will lose anything if you don&apos;t. And I can only dream that Dannish movie makers wake up and return to days of Kreigh-Jakobsen, Larsen, Methling and other old-style geniuses.l",

      "reviewBody": "Another entirely predictable and utterly dull horror film from Thailand; I&apos;m beginning to think that SHUTTER is a stand-alone film entirely, a true diamond in a sea of pebbles. THE COMMITMENT is a yawn-worthy outing with a heavy religious angle with a storyline involving a group of (irritating) girls who decide to visit a haunted shrine in a bid to make all their wishes come true. Inevitably, an evil ghost spirit has other ideas. Sadly, THE COMMITMENT has more in common with bargain-bin US horror than with the kind of classics that the modern Asian ghost story genre is known for.\n\nThis is one of those films where seemingly nothing happens. Each of the various characters are haunted by repetitive dream sequences that never really go anywhere, and each of the scare scenes is overly-familiar and diluted. You never get invested in any of the characters, in fact it&apos;s one of those movies where you&apos;re hoping for sudden deaths for the entire cast. There are one or two grisly moments thrown into the mix, including a particularly unpleasant scene of self-harm, but it&apos;s certainly nothing to get worked up about; instead, I&apos;m frankly perplexed as to why this ever got a release outside of Thailand. It certainly doesn&apos;t merit it.",

Directed by one of Italy&apos;s most famous directors, you would expect this Venice Film Festival silver medal winner to be more available, but it&apos;s almost impossible to find, even in film stores in Italy and France. Perhaps it left a more vivid impression on me because I saw it in Paris, a day after I saw &quot;Death in Venice&quot; for the first time. Try to see if YOU don&apos;t see the uncanny resemblance between the &apos;perfect&apos; adolescent girl in this movie, and the &apos;perfect&apos; boy in &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (both chosen for purity of beauty and risk of fall from innocence). If there weren&apos;t decades and nationalities between these two actors, I&apos;d believe they were twins. Seeing the films one after the other made me truly believe the director had actually chosen her with this resemblance in mind. In any case, the movie may be too slow for most Americans. But for those who appreciate simple, pure character studies, you may fall as deeply in love with this movie as I did. I remember it as being the most technically perfect movie I&apos;ve ever seen and a MUST SEE for all serious film lovers. Decide for yourself. The timing, the dialog, the insight into the minds of the youthful servants, and the generational contrasts were just classic. Simply unparalleled. A beautiful film that marked me for life.

One night while camping they see a Satanic ritual where a young girl is murdered. The members of the cult find out and the couples spend the rest of the movie with witches after them to kill them.\n\nThe story is a little silly and the dialogue is pretty bad but this is the type of movie that used to pack them in at drive-ins. It&apos;s full of action, fast-moving and has likable (if one-dimensional) characters. It&apos;s basically a chase movie disguised and marketed as a horror film. The killing in the movie isn&apos;t that explicit and the nudity in it is purposely blurred out-some people think it was edited from theatrical prints but it was always that way.\n\nThe acting doesn&apos;t really matter--I mean who&apos;s seeing this for the acting? Still all four actors give their all to this. The only thing that bothered me was Swit and Parker screaming nonstop when anything happens and letting Fonda and Oates &quot;save&quot; them. It&apos;s quite amusing to see Parker being attacked by witches in this one since she played the evil witch Angelique in the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; TV series in the late 1960s. The climax is either a perfect one or a lousy one. I&apos;m torn between the two myself.\n\nQuick and fun with a really incredible car chase at the end.",

The first time I watched this movie I thought to myself &quot;What the heck is going on here!&quot; I completely missed the point of the movie the first time I saw it. Fortunately, I was already acquainted with some of Ewan M.&apos;s work, and thought that surely Mr. Mcgregor would have more sense than to make a pointless movie.  Thankfully I was right.  I would advise anyone who doesn&apos;t understand this movie, or who has only seen it once, to watch it again. There is a deeper meaning. All of the actors and actresses were fabulous in this movie!  Although the movie could have served just as well as a short feature, I&apos;m glad that it is longer so that I can enjoy the chemistry between the cast members longer."

The plot takes him to the Louisiana bayou country where an old flame Joanne Woodward has hired him to trace and find out who&apos;s been sending her nasty notes about her sex life.\n\nThe investigation quickly centers around recently fired chauffeur Andy Robinson, but before long Newman gets himself immersed in the local politics of the area with a slick oil millionaire (Murray Hamilton), Woodward&apos;s nymphomaniac daughter (Melanie Griffith), an obsessed police lieutenant (Anthony Franciosa) and various and sundry other bayou characters. Quite a few of the characters are killed off before the climax.\n\nThe Drowning Pool goes somewhat astray in its development, but the ends are nicely tied together at the climax. \n\nThe hit song made popular by Helen Reddy in the seventies, Killing Me Softly With His Song, comes from The Drowning Pool. It was a mega hit back in the day and to my amazement I discovered it wasn&apos;t even nominated for an Oscar.\n\nOf course my favorite here is Anthony Franciosa. He had an incredible ear for dialect and he really got the Cajun speech patterns down to perfection. \n\nBut the real reason I love The Drowning Pool is the scene where Paul Newman and Gail Strickland are locked in a hydrotherapy room by Murray Hamilton. Strickland is Hamilton&apos;s wife. Why they are both there I won&apos;t say, but their escape from the room is one of the most spectacular ever put on film. \n\nYou should see The Drowning Pool for that alone.",

Especially when Hitler did his speech, even though i couldn&apos;t hear it I think his mic was turned off. Hitlers Future wife was very good in this movie. Great actor. This movie should be nominated for an oscar for best documentary. Hitler should be still acting today, to bad he had to retire from life. There should be a sequel for this movie 10/10. Everyone should see this movie. If you haven&apos;t your an uncultured swine.",

He forms a group of juvenile criminals to ensure his position in the prison, in the leadership of the city and then, maybe later on, even in higher politics. But the facts are not that simple... And this movie is also the drama of a young guy, who lost his faith and then found it in a girl, just to lose it again... Brutal, effective, memorable scenes, combined with the best pieces of Hungarian hip-hop music. What else do we need??? So my vote is a 10.",

Book-ended by a mental institution authority addressing the audience, it deals with the sticky subject of young female nymphomania. The American title, TEMPEST IN THE FLESH is rather cheap. The lead role is played by a suitably stunning Francoise Arnoul, one of Europe&apos;s celebrated &quot;Femme fatale&quot;. (Interestingly, she plays opposite Raymond Pellegrin who starred with Brigitte Bardot in a similarly themed film, LA LUMIERE D&apos;EN FACE that was built entirely around Bardot&apos;s breasts. Both films feature the lead actress taking a graphically nude swim for no apparent reason other than to send audience pulses racing.) In RAGE AU CORPS, &quot;Clara&quot; makes an earnest effort to curb her promiscuity by marrying an honourable man, leaving the heavily male-populated construction job where they met and settling in Paris. But the moment her new husband goes away on business, she falls back into lusty &quot;amateur hooker&quot; mode. Inevitably, something violent occurs which lands her in hospital. The film ends with her husband visiting her after a lengthy life-threatening operation. She slowly awakes. Cut to: close-up of her with an ambiguous look of either contentment from having been &quot;cured&quot; or a look of intense &quot;Let&apos;s do the nasty. Now.&quot; Does she live? Does she die? See this one if only to try and figure out why so many of the female characters have religious crosses dangling from chains within their sweaty cleavage.",

      "reviewBody": "What more can be said of Raimi&apos;s legendary cult-classic that hasn&apos;t already been beaten to death like a puss-oozing zombie that crosses paths with Ash? Possibly nothing, but I&apos;ll try. \n\nBefore Spiderman and before the countless spin-offs of this movie were made or even conceived, Raimi and friends decided to make a low budget zombie flick mainly for fun, and surprisingly it has become a masterpiece of shock and horror. Possibly a perfect example of how to make an entertaining film on a shoe-string budget, The Evil Dead delivers what it promises, the ultimate in grueling horror. Even with it&apos;s mild budget and sometimes shaky acting, TED shocks and spooks the audience through chilling atmosphere and some of the most violent effects ever put on film. Those who are squeamish need not apply. As a matter of fact, just run for your girly life.\n\nThere are several reasons this film succeeds. First, Raimi&apos;s camera work is truly masterful. By using fast camera work and aggressive shots, Raimi has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. His style from behind the camera is absolutely unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the beginning of the film, where the camera alone creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your nails in suspense of what&apos;s to come. You feel at any moment someone is going to get their neck chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. One of the most impressive openings I can think of, perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even better once the action starts. Some shots hold for a seeming eternity, and part of you wishes for it to stop for it&apos;s unrestrained gore and violence...but the other part of you is getting a sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive shots is where the darkness from the trees begins to chase people, knocking any tree or obstacle down that happens to be in it&apos;s way. Truly magnificent technique, however they did it. \n\nTED also succeeds because it&apos;s self-aware of the fact that it&apos;s a simple zombie movie and never takes itself too seriously, and doesn&apos;t expect the audience to do so either. It&apos;s meant to be campy, cheesy, revolting and chilling at the same time. There are moments in the film where it seems to be making fun of itself and the genre in general. For this fact alone, one cannot hold certain things against it such as sometimes questionable acting from the supporting cast and sometimes the downright implausibility of certain situations. If you can accept this and you&apos;re not put off by mannequin ultra-violence, then you should find yourself on the supporter&apos;s side of the fence. I think some don&apos;t like it because it can be ridiculous and cheesy in parts, although it was meant to be. Even with the fact that it&apos;s sometimes cheesy, there are some downright chilling moments in this film that most horror films nowadays cannot begin to muster. Case in point, the zombie screaming from the cellar door. The zombie growls and howls themselves are enough to send shivers up one&apos;s spine. And let&apos;s not forget the unforgettable tree love scene, ridiculous and hilarious simultaneously.\n\nLast but certainly not least: Bruce Campbell as Ash, the badass of all zombie films. Campbell is Ash, period, and always will be.\n\nIn my opinion, this is by far the best of the trilogy, and although there could have been more of the chainsaw, this is the definitive zombie film and probably always will be. I feel it succeeds over it&apos;s sequels due to it&apos;s increased violence and lack of humor in comparison. It&apos;s blood, gore, camera work, and shock factor are still formidable even today and are what make this such a cult classic. If you&apos;ve ever liked any horror film, this is an absolute must-see.\n\nLove or hate it, there it is.",

Unfortunately, this movie is not so much disgusting as it is truly awful, and every element of the cinematic arts--acting, directing, scripting, photography, editing, scoring--is rock-bottom deplorable here. &quot;Director/writer&quot; Robins himself plays Umgar, a clubfooted worm breeder who talks to his little squirmy darlings, calls them by name, and takes decided action when some slimy land developers try to push him off his turf; namely, he puts his pets in the local town&apos;s food. Thus, we are treated to various loudmouthed (every character in this flick seems to scream his or her lines obnoxiously), truly ugly personages eating spaghetti &amp; worms, hot dogs &amp; worms, ice cream &amp; worms, cake &amp; worms, and even worms &amp; worms with his/her mouth wide open and in delectable close-up. For some reason never explained, these folks then turn into worm people themselves, and squeak and slither for the rest of the picture, supposedly hilariously. But not a single gag is the slightest bit funny here, many details go unexplained, Umgar&apos;s phony German accent is almost incomprehensible, the film&apos;s theme song is offensively and annoyingly catchy, and the net result is a film far worse than just about anything in the Ed Wood oeuvre. I&apos;ve seen a lot grosser films, truth to tell, but none much worse; still, I wouldn&apos;t want to watch &quot;The Worm Eaters&quot; while scarfing down a bowl of linguini marinara!",

      "reviewBody": "You really had to be a teenager in 1957 to appreciate the effect this movie had on teens back then.  Elvis was just starting out and there are similarites to the reactions of adults and teenagers to both icons. (In fact Yvonne Lime was &quot;dating&quot; Elvis (pictures of Elvis and Yvonne together were in movie magazines back then) when this film was made and from what I understand, he even visited the set.  Too bad they couldn&apos;t have had him sing a song in it!)  There is an amazing backstory AMC could make about the senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and this film; the senators mentioned the bad effects this film had on teenagers even though none of them had seen it!\n\n   Anyway, Gene Fowler Jr (who had edited Academy Award films like LAURA) was chosen to direct this, his first film and although he at first had second thoughts about doing it, his wife convinced him &quot;no one would see it anyway.&quot;  Boy, was she wrong!  His background as an editor helped him be a better first-time director than most and helped make this picture, made on a shoe-string budget in only 7 days, better than all the other teen horror films back then.  The camera angles on the fight at the beginning, Dawn Richard&apos;s gymnist seeing the werewolf  upside down at first (and therefore the audience too), showed that he had good ideas in setting up shots.\n\n   Michael Landon, contrary to what some believe, never downplayed his connection to this film for it gave him his start in show business.  He may at first have had doubts about being connected with it with the initial uproar, which is why he turned down the chance to play the werewolf a second time, but after that, he never bad-mouthed the film.  In fact, he paid homage to it on a Halloween episode of &quot;Highway to Heaven.&quot;\n\n  Anyway, the acting is good all around with standout performances by Landon and Whit Bissell.  The &quot;science&quot; used to turn Tony into the monster may be silly today, but in the 1950&apos;s, there were a lot of talk and film plots about past-life regression following the Bridey Murphy newspaper accounts (also used in THE SHE-CREATURE).  Again you had to live in the 1950&apos;s to understand all this. Philip Scheer&apos;s werewolf makeup is one of the better pre-Howling/American Werewolf ones in movie history and while the transformation scene isn&apos;t as good as in THE WOLF MAN or THE WEREWOLF, the director did not have a lot of money or time to work with and did a good job considering. \n\n   A film has to be pretty good, even with a low budget, to be as successful as this one was...and to remain a cult favorite 45 years later.  It has stood the test of time and deserves to be considered a classic of its kind.",

This mediocre movie is a 100-minute snorefest about a bad dude (played by Mickey Rourke, who contributes nothing to the role), who kidnaps a upper-middle-class family.  Most of the other actors do good to very good jobs, notably Michael Morse who plays one of Rourke&apos;s cronies, and Anthony Hopkins in a role which is far beneath him.  But the plot is nothing but totally predictable filler and just when you think it has gone nowhere, it goes even more nowhere.  Since we already know that the script can be done well, there is no one to blame here except Michael Cimino for the non-direction this movie took.  5 out of 10.",

Fortunately over 12 months later Sky got around to showing it and I was delighted that it was as sweet as I remembered. I&apos;m usually a bit of a cynic with &quot;family&quot; movies, but, this had such a nice feel about it and on a miserable British winter day it was a great tonic. I had often wondered what had happened to Steve Guttenburg and he turned in a nice performance as did Kathleen Quinlan. The kids were good too, not sickly sweet and nauseating as some movie kids are. As for the comment about the kid with the Goth look, you have no clue about teenagers, she came across as a typical one. The animals were good too and all in all it was a nice easy to watch movie and I&apos;d rather watch it 10 times than have to sit through &quot;Big Momma&apos;s House 2&quot; and it&apos;s ilk just the once. 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The heart and spirit of H. G. Wells&apos;s novel remains intact in this Ray Harryhausen/Nathan Juran vehicle.  A 20th century frame story about American led international crew landing on moon and finding an old Union Jack flag and a letter giving rights to the moon to Queen Victoria in 1899 add a brilliant touch to this story about a professor and his two neighbors exploring space and landing on the moon.  The scientific explanation for space travel is absurd as are many other plot contrivances, but the story is a fun, entertaining romp about what exploration use to be like when man relied less on machines and more on brains.  Director Juran and Harrysausen have created a film with many funny moments, beautiful moon landscapes, and even some thought-provoking questions about human nature and what humans are all about.  Although this is not like any other Harryhausen picture - really only one large, cumbersome, rather mundane creature, Harryhausen really evokes awe as he creates a total vision of what a society might look like underneath the surface of the moon.  The moon is a startling set and impressive.  Laurie Johnson(Avenger&apos;s Theme) adds her brilliant touch and creates some beautiful music for the film.  But when is all said and done - for me - the brightest star in this galactic romp is Lionel Jeffries as Professor Cavour.  Jeffries lights up every scene he is in.  His ability to use humor in every reflex and word make him a joy to behold. Does he overact?  Perhaps.  But in the same way that Vincent Price did.  He steal his scenes and this picture.  Edward Judd does nicely in his role as does Martha Hyer, who is beautiful as well."

      "reviewBody": "...And I was wondering why. That guy on the Washington Post said the film is boring because &quot;it´s like watching some other´s family album&quot;... On the paper, I´d agree with him, but after watching the movie i have to say that I do not. I guess it has to do with the little, precious details (those long travellings inside the house, for instance: this is a very well directed movie), the humor, the music, with Gassman of course, and with the fact that we´re actually watching the whole life of a man we cannot dislike: the last scene, with the 80 years old Gassman -the grandfather now- posing with all his family for the photo (as in the very first scene, when he´s a baby surrounded by people that will die eventually) has such deep emotional impact, because, I guess, shows finally that life is a trip that inevitably has an end, and where the new ones will occupy the seat of the old ones, and that´s how it should be, and the movie has a sense of calm acceptation of that. In &quot;La famiglia&quot; you see, as Cocteau said, &quot;death doing her work&quot;. It´s true that the story seems to have no point, but also, I don´t think life has a point. At least I cannot see one...\n\nI really liked this movie. In my opinion, 7/10."

He was a Martial Arts expert and even an instructor of the Mexican Army Military Police (he broke concrete blocks, woods and other stuff, which is not very surprising today, but the way he did it make it interesting, because before breaking his targets, he first stood in one foot over the targets lifting a woman, and that was a proof of the clean free-of-tricks exhibition). He was able to escape from chains, strait jackets and handcuffs without tricks or keys. So he became in late 60&apos;s early 70&apos;s a national hero, all kids were dreaming to be as strong and wise as Professor Zovek.\n\nProducers took advantage of his popularity to start a series of movies with Zovek as a star (the first contract was for nine). They could make 1 and a half because he was killed in a very strange accident in March 1972; the audience respected and admired the Professor and they continued cheering his adventures in this movie and in &quot;La invasion de los Muertos&quot; (Mexican version of &quot;The night of the living dead&quot;) with the Professor as central character so he was acting himself in both movies.\n\nHe couldn&apos;t finished the making of &quot;La invasion de los muertos&quot; because of his accident so they rewrote the script and called a Mexican wrestling star &quot;Blue Demon&quot; to finish it.\n\nPeople knew that most of the amazing actions they saw on screen performed by Zovek were somehow part of his repertory.\n\nYou gonna enjoy watching this movie where Zovek demonstrates his abilities fighting a crazy scientist, Leobardo Druso (Jose Galvez) Nobel price in physics who wants to conquer the world using some kind of telepathic orders.\n\nDr. Druso has to kill to colleagues by placing a bomb in an airline flight, and he does because he needs to be free to continue with his experiments. Zovek is involved because he has been following the process of their work using his telepathic skills.\n\nWhen Dr. Druso realizes that the Professor sent his secretary Virginia (Nubia Marti) and his driver Chano (German Valdez &quot;Tin-Tan&quot;)to follow his men, he order his kidnapping to investigate and use the powerful mind of the professor.\n\nMexico 1971.

You can start out with Audition (or one of the Dead or Alive movies), follow that up with Happiness of the Katakuris and then either Ichi the Killer or Visitor Q. Once you have seen that, then you are ready to savor the flavor of this movie. To try to describe this movie would do the movie and you, the reader, an injustice. This movie just has to be watched and experienced. What can you expect from Gozu ?? Yakuzas. Killer Yakuza attack dogs. Lots of driving. Transvestites. Breast milk. Seance. Horse cropping. Sex. Birth. Ladles. The plot is based on the adventures of a yakuza made-man (Ozaki) and his underling (Minami). Ozaki is going crazy and the Boss has ordered Minami to take care of him. From there on you&apos;ll just have to watch to get the point (if there is one). As compared to his other movies, this one doesn&apos;t really have much of a story. The sheer obscureness or strangeness (and/or dark comedy) holds the various events together, linking them into a movie. At the same time, you are sitting there waiting to see how much more bizarre things can get. The movie passed by pretty quickly, with little slowdown. Fans of Miike should definitely see this movie. For everyone else, see the movie at your risk.\n\n-Celluloid Rehab",

It would have been nice to get a warm and fuzzy ending but still a great movie worth watching.

      "reviewBody": "Riddick is left for dead on an unknown planet with hostel indigenous predators. With a bounty on his head he calls upon the very people who want to have him killed in order to escape.\n\nDirector/writer David Twohy certainly delivers a fan pleasing sequel that fittingly harks back to the first instalment&apos;s roots in both story linkage and tone. While not as grand, fans of Chronicles will also be pleased with the stripped continuation back story and a cameo from Karl Urban&apos;s Vaako.\n\nIt&apos;s a good piece of science fiction action entertainment with decapitations, shootings, spaceships, a hostile planet, yes it&apos;s familiar and debatably derivative as the characters get picked off one by one, but as with Pitch Black Twohy effortlessly manages to create a convincing environment with new memorable biological creatures which is no easy task, to his credit it&apos;s no often lighting strikes twice given how many forgettable alien creatures have been put on screen. Yet, even though reminiscent Alien (1979) he manages to recreate what he did with the photosensitive, reptilians in his breakout 2000 film.\n\nVin Diesel returns as the character created by Jim Wheat &amp; Ken Wheat- Riddick, this time he rekindles his previous edginess but the &apos;one Riddick and his dog&apos; aspect expands the character, sneakily retaining some likability (especially for animal fans).\n\nGiven the way the production was funded the special effects are a mixed bag but serve their purpose. The first act is a special effect survival piece with sparse dialogue and smart action, with the second act taking place after an (unstated) amount of time when Riddick finds a small base. From then on its full of action setups, space motorcycles, conflicts and one-liners as the mercenaries and bounty hunters have to make an alliance with Riddick to survive an impending alien onslaught. \n\nThe supporting characters are developed just enough to be both identifiable, memorable and you almost care just enough to invest your time. Spanish actor Jordi Mollà gives a standout performance as the head hunting, unsavoury Santana, Total Recall (remake) actor Brokeem Woodbine gives some weight with his limited dialogue. Katee Sackhoff while feeling a little typecast still delivers the goods, even the remaining groups stereo-types are more fleshed out than they should be of the genre which adds to the enjoyment. Matt Nable is a good lead as Boss Johns whose character gives the story a (satisfying) little twist that those familiar with the original will see coming a mile off. \n\nThe closing is arguably abrupt but is possibly intentional as it leaves you wanting more. The critiques maybe a little hard on Riddick but considering it is a third in a film series spurred from such humble beginnings, an inviolate first (small comparison to is sequel) Riddick is entertaining viewing."

Director Bruno Rahn died at the age of forty the year this slightly later &apos;street&apos; film was released and although not quite as effective as the former it again features the Great Dane, this time as Auguste, the ageing tart with a heart. Her portrayal here is nothing short of miraculous and transcends the art of film acting. She does not seem to be &apos;acting&apos; at all, just &apos;being&apos;. Watching the unbearably tragic tale of Auguste unfold reminds me of the words of Ted Hughes referring to humans as &apos;ephemeral creatures, facing the abyss, on a spinning ball of self-delusion&apos;.

The characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. The fun of it comes from watching Crawl (Shore&apos;s character), a ditzy-yet-wise California dude a country college girl brings home for Thanksgiving, trying in his awkward (yet endearing) way to fit in to their lifestyle. I was also surprised that in all this there was a message. If you have a chance, see this movie!",

He doesn&apos;t shy away from kidnapping the son of one of the two men. A race against time begins...\n\nGiorgio ARDISSON (1931-2014) and Sieghardt RUPP (1931-2015) impress in parade roles tailored to them. Also interesting is the participation of Hamburger Katrin SCHAAKE (*1931), who would later make a few appearances in FASSBINDER films.\n\nNot only worth seeing for fans of the GERMAN ADVENTURE FLICKS!",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the first Beethoven film, it was flawed but it was cute and charming. The second had its contrivances but it was watchable, while the third and fourth films were mediocre at best. So what can I say about Beethoven&apos;s 5th? My, my, my, this is by far the worst of the series, a real dog of a movie with one redeeming quality. And I have already given away that redeeming quality in the title. Yes, sorry to say, but for me Beethoven was the only good thing about this film, he is likable, funny and well trained and he is the only likable character here. I guess I could say the same for the previous two canine adventures, though the films themselves didn&apos;t quite reach this one&apos;s awfulness. Everything else did not work at all. The soundtrack, one of the redeeming qualities of the previous films, isn&apos;t necessarily horrendous, it is just the matter of how it was placed in the film. Sometimes it felt obtrusive and predictable here. But that isn&apos;t the worst part. Beethoven&apos;s 5th I felt was shoddily made, almost direct-to-video quality. Even worse than this was the direction, it was so awful and unfocused. The script has too many cheesy moments, and the plot is dreadfully weak. I know the plot wasn&apos;t necessarily a strong point of the first film not to mention the sequels that followed, but here it is disjointed and poorly structured with no sense of drive. And the characters, with the exception of Beethoven, don&apos;t have any sparkle. The actors just look as though they are trying to say here I am, and what am I doing in this movie, in short they looked embarrassed even those who were trying to give the film energy did not succeed due to the failure of the script and plot. Overall, this is an awful entry of the Beethoven series. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

One thing that really stuck in my memory was the musical score which I have now discovered was nominated for an Academy Award - very hard to believe for a B film.

The acting is mediocre but the main protagonist delivers a good performance. The music gives this movie an emotional tone, a good one, similar to many animes. The atmosphere is quite dark but it hard for me phrase why exactly, but it is good and fits the scenario. So if you like good dark crime movies with an artistic edge or if you are a fan of Dedective Conan you should totally watch this.",

I remember very well, I watched it on an original video (Apollo) and I also recorded it on channel 4 in 15 years ago, these scenes still there but sadly I lost it. \n\nDeleted Scenes\n\n1. Govinda&apos;s fake trophy. 2. Amitabh went to college to see Govinda&apos;s headteacher. 3. Extra song before ending credit - &apos;Ek Doosre Se Karte Hain Pyaar Hum&apos;."

In the end it was a nice view, it has some funny scenes and cheesy ones too. Yoon Eun Hye, as the &apos;tough&apos; girl, portrays a cute character. The weak points are that in some parts it was just boring, in the &quot;i got it, move on with the next scene please!&quot; way, and in the second half the plot twist&apos;s introduction was somehow confused.",

The well written parts for Tea Stjärne and Fredrik Hallgren help them stand out and to give their top notch comical timings. A further big plus is that the entire cast is charismatically enjoyable, with no exception. The very youngest charmer of the bunch, gets to mentor the main character. One of many decisions that brings a delightful freshness to the adventure. Most screen time has been devoted to a storyline that doesn&apos;t come across as the creators&apos; forte´. The romancing teenager-storyline. It has been fumbled with so badly that it is a mood killer instead of romantic, as intended. My excitement sank like a midsummer pole into the swamp, about this unfortunate curve-ball to the younger stars. They are now easily blamed for the coughing story engine.",

There is nothing that Kidder can do to save this chop job of a film."

      "reviewBody": "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;. &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.\n\nThere are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria&apos;s mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria&apos;s natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold&apos;s hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.\n\nScriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV&apos;s unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.\n\nLessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford&apos;s attempt on Victoria&apos;s life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria&apos;s accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a &quot;Regency Order&quot;; the Duchess&apos;s constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.\n\nThere are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a &quot;Danger! Major cliché ahead!&quot; warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;).\n\nThe main reason for the film&apos;s success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria&apos;s Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",

The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles.  If you go into this film expecting the first Conan or Excalibur, than you will hate it.  If you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good, dumb fun you will have a good time.  Watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers, its funniest scene in the film. I wish Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have done this!!",

      "reviewBody": "I just had the pleasure of seeing Bright Star tonight. I was hoping it would be as good as the trailer, and it was. The trailer is not misleading in this sense but a pretty good representation of the movie.\n\nMost of the negative reviews I&apos;ve read for this have something to do with how the film is &quot;little&quot; or &quot;slow.&quot; Rarely, they comment that it&apos;s &quot;melodramatic.&quot; Which it&apos;s NOT by any means. It is not mawkishly sentimental at all. It&apos;s not epic, it is small in a way, and there&apos;s never any seizing moment of action. That doesn&apos;t make it boring; it&apos;s engaging throughout. \n\nThis is different from any period film I&apos;ve ever seen, or really, imagined. It&apos;s not like typical period pieces in trying to wow you with its aesthetic recreation of the time, it&apos;s not so much about the visual splendor, though it looks very lovely and is thoroughly convincing as a representation of that period. It&apos;s visually quite different from other period pieces, it has a more realistic and kind of earthy look rather than pastel-colored and with a glow around everything. There are slums and less-than-palatial places. This isn&apos;t Pride and Prejudice. Neither does it have sort of a broad, sweeping narrative. At heart it&apos;s a deep love story about famed poet John Keats and his love and muse, Franny Brawne, whose relationship was cut short by a tragic death. It delves deeply into the small details of their courtship, and is pretty involved psychologically.\n\nThese people are portrayed realistically. Even the more minor characters, they all seem to be real people, with actual personalities, rather than caricatures or types of stuffy Regency people who are preoccupied with propriety and good marriage matches. Fanny&apos;s mother is nice, the main issue with her marrying Keats is that he literally can&apos;t support her, and the people they know aren&apos;t mindlessly concerned about it. They actually have FUN and do more interesting things than stand at ballroom dances and sit at dinner. Who would have thought people in a Regency period movie could actually climb trees, walk in the mud, or do quirky, whimsical things? Their ease and naturalness and relative candor in moving around, interacting with, and talking to each other was refreshing and definitely different from the idea you generally get. And this is the first period piece I&apos;ve ever, ever seen where anyone has actually picked up and held their pet cat and treated it like you would your pet. You can actually hear it purring, it&apos;s a real part of their surroundings. I liked that cat, it was cute.\n\nThe dialogue was superb. It wasn&apos;t this sloppy, general, or comical/absurd stuff. It was precise, clear, charged with personality, and often beautiful. When you hear the conversations between Fanny and John, it&apos;s brilliant, real, and a pleasure. I have never seen such intelligence, subtlety, or elegance in a movie in this way. To hear Fanny respond to something John said, even just a word, as if she were actually thinking about it, as would happen in real life, as if she were an intelligent, feeling, witty person, was so nice. And so DIFFERENT. It&apos;s a little hard to explain if you haven&apos;t seen it. Suffice it to say, the dialogue is delicate and nuanced. They are articulate but not pretentious, they are sensitive, individual people - not unreal types who don&apos;t pick up on details. And it being about Keats, the characters have a lot of literary intelligence. You will enjoy the poetry in the movie.\n\nThe acting was great. Keats - I would probably fall in love with him, too. He seems like such a sensitive, romantic, and intelligent guy. Ben Whishaw was perfect for him. And Abbie Cornish as Fanny is wonderful - while not extravagantly gorgeous exactly, her face has such clear features that she has an extraordinary appeal. She is a very striking character, and deeply feeling about Keats. You get a real sense of love, real responses to grief instead of just a pretty swoon. It was a real romance - their tender kiss was beautiful, the things they said to each other, and the things they felt.\n\nThis movie is one of those rare films that are almost perfect to me. That doesn&apos;t make it my favorite movie, but it means I didn&apos;t find much wrong with it. The emotion isn&apos;t overwhelming, it&apos;s not exactly visceral, but it&apos;s moving and penetrating, it has its own style. It&apos;s NOT sappy or conventional. The extreme intelligence, realism, and emotional depth of this movie truly set it apart from all others. I heard a review say something like about how it&apos;s just about &quot;old British speech and mannerisms,&quot; which couldn&apos;t be farther from the truth. It is NOT driven by quaintness or generic period speech like other period films. The dialogue is not stiff, pretentious, or artificial, though it&apos;s accurate. Sweet, moving, and intelligent, Bright Star has rare depth. It&apos;s definitely like no other movie. You should go see it if you think you&apos;d be into it at all, by any stretch. You might not like it - it is rather &quot;slow,&quot; but very interesting, at least for me - but it would be a thick or insensitive person indeed who couldn&apos;t appreciate it in some way. It&apos;s like how Keats described Fanny - &quot;the brightest, most delicate thing.&quot;\n\nMy favorite quotes are:\n\n&quot;A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Its loveliness increases. It will never pass into nothingness.&quot;\n\n&quot;I almost wish we were butterflies, and lived but three summer days. Three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.&quot; \n\nThere are many others, much of Keats&apos; letters to Fanny is so beautiful, but I can&apos;t remember them off the top of my head. These are two that appear in the trailer.",

I love the set up of a hospital pathologist getting messages form the dead that indicate to the police that he might well be the local serial killer.\n\nAnd worse still, by the end of the film the pathologist ( Jeff Fahey) starts to believe these rumours and begins to believe that he could himself be the killer...Supporting actors of Marty Kove and Bruce bring strong supernatural element to the film, while Jon Morrey and Kim Thomson fight it out in some of the last scenes. Also some really Great strong Directing and suitably spooky and emotional score from Paul Turner,\n\nA great psychological thriller with some really deep emotional drama\n\nThe denournment was most unpredictable....I enjoyed this one very and would strongly recommend it",

      "reviewBody": "A young and a middle-aged couple befriend each other in a summer datcha which belongs to neither of them, they&apos;ve just sneaked into it and this generates a sense of comradery. The young lovers are still in the process of becoming acquainted to each other and adopt the older ones as role-models. The former never come to know that the latter are clandestine lovers leading separate lives at home because he can conceive no way how to get out of his existing matrimonial ties. The movie functions as a strong allegory about societal lies young people are lured into. I was particularly impressed in the first half by the contrast of the older&apos;s relaxed cheerfulness to the younger&apos;s bewildered hauntedness and in the second half by the portrayal of the passion with which the woman loves the married man. It is depicted alternately as leaving her empty and as an irresistible means of enduring life.",

I have in mind that I&apos;m not the target group. But even from a children&apos;s / girl&apos;s point of few this movie is the worst in the series.\n\nOne of the problem is the introduction of new characters. They appear quite suddenly and you have to wait for the explaination (who is this and why). Ok for an adult movie but not for children. My daughter (12 years old) kept on asking and lost interest quite soon.\n\nIf you still like slow motion shots of horses and the nice summervibe pictures of Gut Kaltenbach, then go for it. Even Hanna Binke as Mika returns for a few scenes (the rest of the movie you can see her sleeping).\n\n2 stars for the basic story idea and the solid acting of Ari.",

      "reviewBody": "Walter Hill is one of those directors who seems never to make an average film. His movies are, generally-speaking, either very good or very bad. 48 Hours is one of his &quot;very good&quot; offerings. It gives Eddie Murphy one of cinema&apos;s most unforgettable movie debuts, and invents the conventions of the buddy cop genre that were to become blueprints for years to come. Every buddy picture after 1982 - including Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Fled, Bad Boys, and a thousand more - owes something to 48 Hours.\n\nThe film opens with psychopathic Albert Ganz (James Remar) escaping from a chain gang. Determined to track down Ganz, tough cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) springs a fast-talking convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from jail for forty-eight hours, during which time the mismatched duo must find their quarry. Cates doesn&apos;t like blacks, and Hammond doesn&apos;t like cops, so before they can even get to the business of tracking down their man they first have to come to terms with working alongside each other.\n\nFast-paced, energetic, foul-mouthed and funny, 48 Hours is simply a great ride. Nolte underplays brilliantly, wisely allowing Murphy to handle the loud and showy role while he etches a gruff, rugged characterisation as a cop on the warpath. The leading characters are rounded off wonderfully by James Remar, as a genuinely bad &quot;baddie&quot;. If the plot to 48 Hours sounds like a collection of all the clichés and predictabilities that ruin most films, it&apos;s important to remember that before this film nothing like it had really been done. These plot devices and conventions are only considered &quot;cliches&quot; nowadays because 48 Hours was so influential, not to mention frequently-imitated, in the ensuing years. James Horner&apos;s music score is perfectly judged too. Finally, no review of 48 Hours would be complete without some acknowledgment of the film&apos;s most famous scene. I&apos;m talking - of course - about the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn&apos;t so. It really is an electrifying screen moment.... in a film that really is an electrifying screen experience!",

      "reviewBody": "There needs to be films made that have this type of shock effect to your mental and emotional system, but it took me three years to work it out. I watched it at the Gothenburg Film Festival and my immediate reaction was: &quot;Heck, this shouldn&apos;t have been shown in public, I am now permanently damaged in my mind and in my soul. Help me.&quot; Now, however, after a few years of pondering the images and issues presented to me and how it was done, I must say that it is a masterpiece, utterly destroying previous conceptions of what the world is like. With great &quot;wit&quot; and &quot;style&quot; (I will refine these points!) the story is told in a rapid tempo and with no loose ends and no censoring. The &quot;style&quot; thing: I propose that this is realism taken to a new level, with the really, really shitty reality of these low-life misfits shown at its worst, both from within and from without as is should be presented, uncensored like a bad nightmare, but presented a if it were true. And this is the shocking part: the movie makes you feel like it is true. This is sort of balanced with the &quot;wit&quot; part; burlesque, ironic and totally black humour; to make a soup so thick it can&apos;t be swallowed without being chewed really well, and when you chew it you just want to spit it out because the taste makes you want to throw up. 9/10, would have got full points if it had actually made me throw up.",

It looks at her lonely days post-stardom - when she sought to patch her fading looks with too many plastic surgery operations and became semi-reclusive.\n\nWhat is clear from this documentary is that &apos;Hedy Lamarr&apos; masked a clever and courageous woman who knew exactly what she wanted, and who used her brains to leave something far more useful that a body of film work. The fact that she signed her patents away meant that only a few years before her 2000 death could the truth be revealed, and Anthony Loder has done a good job here to present a balanced portrait of his mother - leaving the inevitable questions and leaving her some of the mystique Hollywood lent her."

It is a fairly predictable movie, but always fun to watch Mathew McConaughey play the guy who hasn&apos;t grown up along with Kate Hudson playing the lady who wishes he would. Their chemistry is great, and isn&apos;t that all you really expect from a movie like this, regardless of plot?\n\nThe only thing that didn&apos;t fit in the movie was a couple of overly bloody scenes (on an absolute basis the blood was very minor, but the fact that they showed up at all was surprising.)\n\nNot the best movie you will ever see, but will certainly give you a break from all this extreme winter weather we have been having.",

      "reviewBody": "Zidane, un portrait du 21e siècle offers an unusual and surprisingly thoughtful experience, providing a sense of the frustration and isolation of a legendarily talented footballer, but little more.\n\nThe film begins with a silent first 15 minutes observing Zidane&apos;s skill and movement. It feels rather like you&apos;re watching the Skysports player-cam and as such, is a little disappointing. Coupled with the initial jumping back to the perspective of a viewer watching at home, then returning back to the high quality camera POV&apos;s, it leaves you somewhat restless, as the director tries to create a hyperbole of space and reality. However, you soon become aware of the human ambiance; Zidane&apos;s heavy breathing, feet dragging on the grass like a stag before battle, the visceral crunches of hefty challenges; all creating a very tangible texture.\n\nIn a moment after the referee wrongly gives away a penalty, which the opposition score, Zidane approaches and speaks the words &quot;You should be ashamed&quot;. Zidane&apos;s tone and presence makes this emphatic condemnation almost papal.\n\nThere are times in this film when one finds them self checking the time remaining on the DVD player. Whilst being able to appreciate Zidane&apos;s awesome touch and effortless ability, the footage is repetitive and too enclosed to really gather a true sense of Zidane&apos;s perspective. Those audiences who make it past the 15 minute mark are rewarded when Mogwai&apos;s splendid soundtrack kicks in and is complimented by Zidane&apos;s subtitled monologue. Here, you really appreciate the fact that they didn&apos;t choose an English footballer as their subject. The delicate manner in which french translates, provides a poetic and cinematic syntax. We English are very wasteful with our words and I&apos;m sure if we were hearing David Beckham&apos;s thoughts, we would be more spurious at the lack of numerous mentions of &quot;Obviously&quot;, &quot;You know&quot; and &quot;fantastic&quot;. \n\nAt half time the film installs context to the game displaying both violently moving images together with trivial incidents apparently going on elsewhere in the world whilst the game takes place. The intriguing suggestion is that the match, tied with fate, is pointless and memorable like all things. \n\nIn truth, after this point, the film has completed it&apos;s goal and as such, drags to the finish. The camera work seems dizzying and whilst the intention is to make the viewer feel Zidane&apos;s experience, it ultimately fails. Whilst we empathise with his irritation and patience, we are not rewarded like he is, with the thrill of being on the pitch. There is an absence of space and vision, which, would truly mimic his sensation.\n\nZidane&apos;s exit is practically welcome when he is sent off ten minutes before the match finishes, but he leaves with a poetic sense of irony. After a game of fisticuffs, his hot head landing him in trouble like it did at World Cup 2006, we are left with an emotive sense of futility, his sending off - a metaphor for mortality, leaving the pitch to a hero&apos;s applause. \n\nI think the film could have benefited from more subtitled speech from Zidane and with the extension of the soundtrack lasting from start to finish. But what hampers this film is it&apos;s lack of creating the true experience of space and vision in a football game, in truth, the attempt to re-create Zidane&apos;s frustration at not receiving the ball on time and having his passes clumsily lost, is overwhelmed by our frustration at the sense of claustrophobia and detachment.",

The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was a pompous disclaimer that &quot;not one foot&quot; of documentary footage had been used. But, in light of the finished product, it&apos;s a remarkable statement. If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to its credit that one never gets a sense of &quot;good guys vs. bad guys&quot; here--only of people trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which no escape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the &quot;heroic&quot; Algerian revolutionaries while booing the &quot;villainous&quot; French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint. This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, and beautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven&apos;t seen it and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--and pray that it&apos;s subtitled and not dubbed. (There are dubbed prints and, as is usually the case, dubbing pretty nearly wrecks it.) This is a masterpiece."

      "name": "Thälmann - Founding Father of German Communism",
      "reviewBody": "This film can only be appreciated if one knows its background. It was made in this curious country the GDR, and Ernst Thälmann was the leader of the German communist party before the Second World War. In fact, Thälmann was seen by the GDR-elite as something of a founding father, perhaps in the same way as the Americans admire Washington or Lincoln. Just like the carving of the first American presidents in rock, so one finds megalomaniac statues of Thälmann in the former GDR. This was of course a bit much for the common people, but the film had a relative success (perhaps also because bus loads of school children and personnel clubs were driven for free to the cinemas - try that with YOUR boss!). Somehow the people in the GDR saw that the roots of communism lie in humanism. Even now most people in the former GDR think of their past as indeed living in a dictatorship, but not in a wrong state. Just look at for instance the realistic, touching and much loved film &quot;Paul und Paula&quot;. In addition it should be kept in mind, that Thälmann was active in the same political organization as the much mourned Rosa Luxemburg. On the other hand he was also associated with Walter Ulbricht, who started his career in the GDR as a Stalinist. Thälmann had already been put in a Nazi jail by the time that the cruelties of Stalin reached their climax. The film &quot;Ernst Thälmann&quot; portrays (in 2 DVDs!) his life and death, in a realistic way, but with extreme willingness. Political films are commonly biased, in both east and west, and the communist system has always been to weak to endure criticism from within. The story is therefore a straigthforward historic epic poem, in which the actors do a good job. It is all realism, you get what you see, and there are no hidden meanings, false bottoms or other &quot;bourgeois&quot; deceptions. There is nothing wrong with that. Of course the film can not conceal the violent nature of the communist party, and her destabilizing effect on the Republic of Weimar. In fact it does not even try, since the bringing about of the revolution and the fall of capitalism is the ultimate goal of Leninism, and thus seen as a virtue. The viewer should also bear in mind that in the roaring twenties the Comintern had already become an instrument for the protection of Soviet interests. The revolutionary climate died around 1920. Whereas the proletarian resistance against the fascist Kapp Putsch (1920) was justified and successful, this was not longer the case for the ensuing Ruhr uprising by the communists in 1921. By that time the socialdemocrats and the trade unions had already abandoned the armed resistance against the German military. The Ruhr uprising (against the disarmament of the workers) was without chance, and ordered by the Comintern (with the Soviet president Lenin behind it as driving force) mainly to weaken the German neighbour. The script has no room for such criticism or even doubts. If Thälmann has ever made a mistake, it is certainly not visible in this movie. For some strange reason, the personal glorification of the leaders has always been typical in communist countries. They were probably supposed to represent the human goodness, and be the ultimate example for the common people. With Thälmann this turned out to be especially easy, after his eventual murder by the Hitler fascists. If one is able to feel empathy, and to accept the rather unusual ideological perspective, then the viewer is rewarded with a nice impression of the Republic of Weimar, and the rise and establishment of Nazism.",

The story is solid, and it realistically represents all the crazy things that can happen when outside interests become fanatic. Every character in the cast adds to this realism, despite the fact that on the outside they are broadly portrayed. You don&apos;t really realise any of this when you are falling over from laughing. You can&apos;t beat a two-man revolutionary army, and Baxter&apos;s sleazy wife. And when they get invaded? More joy! It is frankly impossible to explain it...so I won&apos;t.

      "reviewBody": "Soft porn Italian she-wolf horror with loads of throat-ripping, c-word yelling debauchery to offend almost everyone. A young woman (Borel) believes she&apos;s the reincarnation of a two hundred year family link to lycanthropy, and duly turns into a savage she-wolf during the full moon. Complicating matters, she&apos;s also sex-averse due to a harrowing experience when she was younger, seducing her victims before gorging on their blood in retribution for their misguided advances.\n\nFrequent disrobing by almost all of the female cast and a plethora of gory murders will appeal to some audiences, the line between mainstream feature film and sado-porn is sometimes teased, but never fully crossed. Dagmar Lassander has a largely extraneous and minor role, most of which is a sex scene, while Frederick Stafford does an amiable job as the inspector with an ever-burgeoning mountain of corpses, courtesy of our fair maiden Borel. For her part, Borel is intense and obviously committed to her performance, but the film&apos;s erratic narrative fails to focus and consequently, her role is shallow and uninvolving.\n\nDirector Silvestro seems uncertain whether he&apos;s making a werewolf movie, attempting a mental health statement, a rape and revenge flick, or just a softcore trip with apparently divergent themes awkwardly woven into the tale that seems at times never-ending (I saw an uncut 100 minute version which despite all the climaxing throughout the movie, fails to deliver one at the film&apos;s sunset). Little suspense, just buckets of gore, nudity, self flagellation, various sexual acts and grade A profanity to pass the time. Bring it on.",

      "reviewBody": "The amazing piece of timing here is when Warner Bros. began work on this biography of entertainer George M. Cohan, WWII had not yet broken out. The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred the day before shooting began. When the film opened people on the home front badly needed some morale boosting, and this film gave it to them. It&apos;s just a joyous musical costume piece from start to finish with nice comic touches balanced with some sentimental moments (supposedly Walter Huston&apos;s deathbed scene had even taskmaster director Michael Curtiz crying). There&apos;s nothing in the way of real conflict or even much heavy in the way of romance between Cohan and his fictitious film wife &quot;Mary&quot;, who was modeled after Cohan&apos;s actual second wife in some ways. Cohan was actually married twice. Oddly enough, it was Cohan who said he wanted as little romance in the film as possible.\n\nThe more I learn about Cohan the more I realize that Cagney was perfect to play him - both Irish Americans, both about the same size and build, and George Cohan&apos;s style of dancing and singing were about the same as Cagney&apos;s. It&apos;s hard to believe that Fred Astaire was Cohan&apos;s first choice to play himself. Astaire was a great talent, but I don&apos;t think he could have conveyed the combination of mischief, optimism and energy that was Cohan the way that Cagney ultimately did. Several people criticize Cagney&apos;s dancing here, but that eccentric style was Cohan&apos;s, who always considered himself more of an overall entertainer than a dancer in the first place.\n\nIf you&apos;re &quot;date conscious&quot; as I am, there are some matters of plot that might bother you. Cohan was born on July 2 or 3, not July 4. Cohan&apos;s mother outlived his father by eleven years and Cohan&apos;s father was not &quot;very old&quot; when he died as is said in the film - at least by today&apos;s standards. When Cohan&apos;s father died in 1917, he was only 69. Cohan&apos;s sister did die young - she was only 39, dying in 1916, plus she was not his little sister. Instead Josie was a year older than George. The film has Josie marrying when she would have been close to forty, when she actually married at the beginning of the 20th century and thus was the one to break up the four Cohans, not George. Also, Cohan received his Congressional Medal in 1936, not as WWII began as shown in the film. However the plot device of having George M. recount his life story to FDR, receiving his Congressional medal in the Oval Office, and then dance joyously down the White House stairs and into the streets joining a group of marching soldiers in a chorus of &quot;Over There&quot; was probably a great way to bridge Cohan&apos;s patriotic past with what was then an uncertain time that certainly needed a dose of his optimism.\n\nThe one thing that I did find a little odd - and one thing isn&apos;t much in a two plus hour long movie - is that it is hard to spot the actual point in the film where Mary becomes George&apos;s wife. There is quite a bit of domesticity shown before the two were married. Mary is cooking for George, staying in his apartment alone waiting for him to come home from the show, and acting very much like they are already married. The only way you know they are not is that George very subtly pops the question to the point that I&apos;m surprised even Mary knew what he was asking! I know this doesn&apos;t seem like much in today&apos;s world, but considering that they were trying to paint Cohan in the most positive light possible and that the living arrangements might be misunderstood, I am surprised that the censors of that time never raised the issue.\n\nAt any rate, I highly recommend this one. You&apos;ll have a great time, at least in part because you can see that Cagney is having a great time. He always said this film was his favorite, and it shows in his performance.",

      "reviewBody": "Not a lot happens, but we were glued to The Accident.  The script is wonderfully understated.  Pinter as screenplay writer is a different style from Pinter the playwright.  Pinter teases us, though, with a small cameo performance of his own using almost mock-Pinter dialogue for that one short scene.  Also of note script-wise is the scene soon after Pinter&apos;s scene when Dirk Bogarde visits his old flame in London and the dialogue is almost thoughts, almost dialogue - you don&apos;t see either of them actually speaking.\n\n The cinematography on this movie is superb.  Oxford in the summer is a soft target for beautiful shots, but this film fills its boots with that beauty. Yet the dark mood never leaves you despite the beauty - partly because 90% of the movie is a flashback, so you have already seen most of the tragedy unfold.  Also, the behaviour of the two professors is just so awful.  Dirk Bogarde comes across somewhat sympathetically because he is Dirk Bogarde, but the character is a more or less unmitigated toad.  The Stanley Baker character is also horrible.  The acting of all the main characters is superb.\n\nThis is high class stuff - seek it out.",

      "description": "In 2010 Â“Skinwalker RanchÂ” gained media attention after experiencing a wide range of unexplained phenomena.  Reports ranged from UFO sightings to livestock mutilation, but maybe most notable was the disappearance of ranch owner Hoyt MillerÂ’s eight year old son, Cody on November 11, 2010.  Close to a year later, Modern Defense Enterprises (MDE) has sent a team of experts to document and investigates the mysterious occurrences, which only escalate upon their arrival.  The incidents become more violent, causing tensions to rise as the team must decide how far they will go to unlock the mysteries of Â“Skinwalker Ranch.Â”  The group debates whether the answers are worth risking their lives for, or if they should just call off the investigation and leave the ranch Â– that is, if leaving is actually an optionÂ…\r\n \r\n",

      "name": "No mad slasher ever faced an opponent as formidable as Chuck Norris.",
      "reviewBody": "This Chuck Norris vehicle was a little different for its time, taking inspiration not only from the slasher films of the time but classic Dr. Frankenstein type stories.\n\nSo one could say this is part suspense, part sci-fi, and part horror as Norris plays a low key sheriff of a small Texas town. His nemesis this time is a man named John Kirby (Brian Libby), a disturbed sort who&apos;d gone on a rampage and then been gunned down. However, interfering doctors decide to test their experimental rejuvenating serum on the guy, and turn him into a virtually indestructible monster.\n\nAside from one scene where Norris humiliates a gang of bikers, this doesn&apos;t play out like your usual Norris story, and as mentioned goes for scares more than it does action. Director Michael Miller, who&apos;d previously done the cult classic &quot;Jackson County Jail&quot;, handles the material with skill, and manages to create some honest-to-God tension, relying on the music score (composed by Peter Bernstein and Mark Goldenberg) as little as possible. There&apos;s one sequence at about the halfway point that will automatically have the viewer thinking of &quot;Halloween&quot;, and Libby is genuinely creepy as the killer, having little in the way of dialogue. He&apos;s introduced in a striking opening sequence in which the sense of chaos and prowling camera greatly assist in the the mood and the sense of a mind deteriorating.\n\nAn interesting supporting cast certainly helps, although Toni Kalem is an unfortunately nondescript leading lady and the supposed comedy relief intended by the casting of Stephen Furst as Norris&apos; deputy doesn&apos;t really work too well. Ron Silver is also stuck in a grating role as a one-note &quot;voice of reason&quot; type of guy, but excellent character players Steven Keats and William Finley are amusing to watch as the scientists doing things just as much for their own egos &amp; gratification as any desire to help mankind.\n\n&quot;Silent Rage&quot; is a good deal of fun and gets a lot out of its rural setting. The climactic fight is especially noteworthy the way it takes place without a music score to help drive it along. The movie may not appeal to Norris fans across the board, with its lack of emphasis on his fighting skills, but if they&apos;re looking for something a little off the beaten path, it does have its rewards.\n\nTrivia note: none other than Katey Sagal sings the movies&apos; love song.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Dr Frankenstein : Dennis Price and his assistant Morpho : Jesús Franco, are attacked by the giant monster : Fernando Bilbao , as soon as he is brought to life. Then the monster is taken by the immortal magician Cagliostro : Howard Vernon , and his helper , the witch Melissa : Ana Libert . Cagliostro&apos;s goal is to create a new master race and turn over the World. Then Dr Stewart : Alberto Dalbes to do battle against the forces of evil and once again decides it&apos;s time to wipe them off the Earth , unfortunately his is attacked by Frankenstein monster .They have awakened .. and they are the sound of terror!\n\nTypical Jesús Franco of the Seventies , this time revisiting Frankenstein creature . This is the follow-up to &quot;Dracula versus Frankenstein&quot; 1972 with similar techinician and artistic team, adding Paca Gabaldon and shot in same scenarios from Sintra , Lisboa , Portugal . Here shows up ordinary actors of the Jess Frank factory , giving lousy interpretations , such as : Howard Vernon, Dennis Price , Anne Libert , Britt Nichols , and film debut of Lina Romay , Jesús Frank&apos;s future wife and his muse.\n\nIt packs an atmospheric and passable cinematography by Raúl Artigot . Being shot on location in Barcelona, Alicante, Murcia and Sintra, Lisboa , Portugal. As well as atonal and weird musical score by Daniel White, Jesús Franco regular . The motion picture produced by Franco regular producers Arturo Marcos and Robert De Nestle who financed him several movies in the Seventies . The flick was lousily directed by Jesús Franco in his usual style . This La Maldición de Frankenstein or Erotic adventures of Frankenstein was one of a multitude of terror films directed by the hack Jesus Franco, such as : Miss Muerte or The Diabolic Dr Z , Gritos en la Noche , La Mano del Hombre Muerto, Count Dracula , Jack the Ripper , Vampyres Lesbos , Dracula versus Frankenstein , The erotic rites of Dracula , Los Demonios , Mansion of the Living Dead and Doctor Orloff Saga that includes : The Awful Dr Orloff , Secret Dr Orloff , Sinister Dr Orloff , Orloff&apos;s Invisible Monster , Faceless . Rating 4/10 . Inferior and below average horror movie . Exclusively for Jesús Frank completists .",

      "reviewBody": "This is the film version of the best selling book &quot;Der Atem des Himmels&quot; by Reinhold Bilgeri. A drama about a woman, that flees from her past into a mountain village to find love and encounter a horrible avalanche disaster in Vorarlberg/Austria.\n\nI saw this, when it premiered on the Festspielbühne in Bregenz and I was quite impressed.\n\nReinhold Bilgeri is an ambitious man and filmmaker. He wouldn t let go of this project, he believed in it. And you can see, that he put his heart (and his family) in it.\n\nFrom the very first scene the atmosphere of the book was on the screen. The pictures I had in mind when I read the lines were almost identical with what I saw there. Sure, some of the actors were more talented than other but I think this didn&apos;t hurt the overall experience. Some of the people in the film were actually from the region and farmers in real life. Whats more believable than that? From technical aspects is &quot;Der Atem des Himmels&quot; comparable to big German productions despite the low-budget. In the film the focus is more on the drama, less on the avalanche. The story&apos;s between the people, what Erna von Gaderthurn experiences. &quot;Titanic&quot; in the mountains, with less water and more snow.\n\nI did especially like the performance of Reinholds daughter, Laura Bilgeri. She s an upcoming star for sure.\n\nOverall I think you should give the film a shot and see it. It&apos;s the perfect example what man with a vision can achieve. And thats a lot!",

And if you&apos;re not used to Australian English, well, try not to panic. Doesn&apos;t matter if you don&apos;t get every word - just go with it!\n\nThis is the kind of film you don&apos;t see much any more, perhaps a product of its era. They weren&apos;t thinking much about marketing or target demographics - these filmmakers were just having a lot of fun, experimenting and coming up with something unique. Genre crossing, challenging and freaky, it also taps into some big themes about Australian identity and paranoia.",

      "reviewBody": "In Seoul, the eighteen years old student Y (Tae Yeon Kim) decides to meet the thirty-eight years old sculptor J (Sang Hyun Lee) and loose her virginity with him. After a few sexual meetings with J, Y is introduced in SM games, being spanked by Y and becoming addicted in sadomasochistic practice. &quot;Gojitmal&quot; is a very unconventional and daring love story. I saw this DVD on sale and I was really surprised with the boldness of Tae Yeon Kim, Sang Hyun Lee and director Sun-Woo Jang. When I worked in South Korea, I found a Confucian society, with costumes and moral values totally different from western societies, and I respected that a lot. My local colleagues informed me that, for example, the exhibition in the movie theaters of Louis Malle &apos;s &quot;Damage&quot; had been forbidden, since their society would never understand the situation of a father having an affair with the wife of his son. At least, the &quot;soju&quot; remains the same in the present days. Therefore, when I saw that &quot;Gojitmal&quot;, which is indeed a soft porn with very kinky sex, I was really astonished with the behavior of the characters. This movie is not bad, but it is interesting to read that most of the IMDb viewers liked it: the camera is amateurish, the lead actor and actress do not have the usual standard pattern of beauty and the locations are very simple. However, the screenplay is very unconventional and provocative, slightly recalling &quot;The Last Tango in Paris&quot;, and the presentation looks like a documentary. &quot;Gojitmal&quot; is recommended for very specific audiences only. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Mentiras&quot; (&quot;Lies&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "New entry with Bud Spencer as Police Comissioner Rizzo who this time travels to Egypt . Fun comedy set on Naples and a far country as Egypt for Bud Spencer enthusiasts , repeating his usual role as Commissario helped by his underling Caputo ( Enzo Cannavale) and dealing with kidnappings and oil smuggling . They resolve an abducting of the nephew (Cinzia Monreal) a powerful magnate (Robert Loggia) and carried out by some criminals . Rizzo (Bud Spencer or Carlo Perdesoli) is a corpulent and bouncing cop from Napoles who undertakes numerous dangers and adventures . Police Commissioner Rizzo, or Bigfoot (Piedone by nickname) and Marshal Caputo go to Egypt and look for Professor Cerullo (Leopoldo Trieste), who is missing . The scientific has discovered an insect that can smell where petrol is and lots of greed men are interested in it. Rizzo nicknamed Flatfoot travels to big city of El Cairo along with Bodo ( the likable Zulu little Bambino ) and his partner (Enzo Cannavale ) who poses as Arab . Later on , they go to Egyptian desert where meet Assan (Angelo Infanti) , facing off risks, and several adventures.\n\nThis is a good entertaining juvenile for Bud Spencer fans , as he&apos;s delightful . It packs action, fist-play, slapdash, humor with tongue and cheek and is quite amusing . This entertaining , engaging movie is crammed of fist-fights, punches , kicks, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of humor . Bud Spencer is top-notch as one army man taking on a group of bandits and as always he makes his own stunts with comic touches , as usual . This release has some cool and several hilarious moments, though the Terence Hill-Bud Spencer duo films are better . The film isn&apos;t always good , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions ,it&apos;s frankly delicious. The movie displays innumerable laughters , jokes and slapstick . The picture is well starred by Bud Spencer . Bud , the popular Latin movie actor who starred in innumerable spaghetti Westerns and action-packed potboilers during the 1960s and &apos;70s, was born Carlo Pedersoli (1929) in Naples. He was the first Italian to swim the 100 meter freestyle and competed as a swimmer at the Olympic games . He appeared as a member of the Praetorian Guard in his first movie, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&apos;s epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in 1951. He changed his screen name to &quot;Bud Spencer&quot; in 1967, as a homage to Spencer Tracy and to the American beer Budweiser. Spencer achieved his greatest hit in spaghetti Westerns lensed for a global audience. Teaming up with fellow Italian Terence Hill, the two made such international successes as I quattro dell&apos;Ave Maria (1968) and &quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot; . Their dual outings made both stars famous, particularly in Europe. In all, Spencer made 18 movies with Hill . Later on , he became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot after appearing in ¨Crazy plane¨ (1972) and owned an air transport company, Mistral Air, which he founded in 1984. However, he terminated his business interest in Mistral and entered the children&apos;s clothing industry. After 1983, Spencer&apos;s movie career slowed down, though he did have a big success in the early 1990s with the TV action-drama &quot;Extralarge&quot;. A man of many talents, Bud wrote texts and plots for some of his films . He also has registered several royalties.\n\nThe movie contains a catching musical score with noisy songs by Guido and Mauricio De Angelis(Spaghetti Western habitual) and composed by synthesizer, as always . Colorful cinematography who reflects splendidly the Egyptian outdoors , though is necessary a nice remastering . The motion picture is professionally directed by Steno, Stefano Vanzina(father of Carlo Vanzina). He wrote and directed in the 60s Toto vehicles (Toto vs the four, Two colonels) ; Walter Chiari and Raimondo Vianello shows (Heroes of the West, Twins from Texas). In the 70s and 80s directed Bud Spencer movies about Flatfoot or Rizzo, also called Piedone, such as, Flatfoot in Hong Kong, Flatfoot in Egypt and Banana Joe , among others. And in the 80s directed TV series , the Professore Jack Clementi, again with Bud Spencer. Rating : Acceptable and passable , though only for Bud Spencer fans",

      "reviewBody": "Regardless of any criticisms that may be voiced about the film, I have developed a profound love for it. There are numerous reasons behind this sentiment, most notably the fact that proponents of postmodern art theory and those who understand the ever-changing artistic elements within temporal and digital contexts cannot craft a cinematic image that is simultaneously realistic, sensitive, and imbued with a sense of strangeness. Even in terms of execution and with a nearly nonexistent budget, it is sheer nonsense to claim otherwise. Those who support such claims are individuals who fundamentally fail to grasp the profound significance of experiencing a cinematic image as a living expression of what individuals convey when they bring their ideas to life on a moving canvas.\n\nThis film, likewise, is a creation borne out of nothingness, much like the girl born from the void. It presents intimate dialogues concerning thinkers who do not believe in the metaphysical realm, yet peacefully sway within the aesthetic mysticism of history and self, driven by the natural human desire for fulfillment. They dream, they contemplate, and they philosophize because they are humans who cannot be easily confined within the boundaries of reality. They are experimental.\n\nThe context of the film speaks to this form of human empathy within a cinematic framework, crafted by a director who attempted to compose his entire cinematic history through an individual project that, despite years of anticipation, failed to secure the necessary funding. Consequently, he decided to take on the role himself, alongside a girl and a friend, within the confines of his own home, utilizing a dilapidated camera.\n\nPriso, a director who is madly devoted to his artistic world and philosophy, is incredibly captivating in this film.\n\nThe narrative dialogues vividly illustrate the fragility of consciousness at times and its strength at other times, as well as the formation of human desires that drive individuals towards belief despite their lack of faith.\n\nIt is a profound philosophical exploration within an era where films of this nature are no longer afforded genuine presence.\n\nIt is a film about the isolation of individuals when they engage in creative thinking, regardless of the closed boundaries of their creativity and its intersection with a domain that is not their own, as exemplified by the living element of the film itself. The presence of Priso as an actor allows him to fully acknowledge that he is not an actor and does not fulfill the expectations placed upon him. It is the very idea that the film presents through the measurements of conceptual models it showcases.\n\nThis is a film that is not easily embraced, simply because it does not conform to the conventional requirements of mainstream cinema within the context of postmodernism and digital systems.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched this movie on the note from a friend, who kept insisting that I just had to watch it, because it was such a cool movie. So I caved in and sat down to watch the movie, without having any clue what it was all about.\n\nNow, I must say that I think it was a bold topic to make a movie about, but it actually worked out quite well. I am not much fan of movies that are raising debate about social issues, but this movie actually turned out to be interesting and alright.\n\nThe cast in the movie was phenomenal. David Duchovny, playing Steve Jones, and Demi Moore, playing Kate Jones, were really great opposite one another, and they had really good screen chemistry. Amber Heard, playing Jenn Jones, and Ben Hollingsworth in the role of Mich Jones, also put on good performances. But I think Gary Cole, in the role of Larry Symonds, was actually one of the better guys in the movie, he played his role quite well.\n\nThe story told in &quot;The Joneses&quot; about our consumerist society was somewhat interesting, and it manages to keep you riveted to the chair, wanting to see what happens next in the movie. But was it really one that was necessary being told? I found the movie to be adequate entertainment, but it didn&apos;t really raise any issues about consumerism after having seen it. Maybe because I just take a movie for what it is, a movie - a means of entertainment.\n\nI noticed the movie was labeled as a comedy, which I would disagree with. Drama, yes, but comedy, no. At least not in the sense that it will make you laughing and rolling on the floor. Sure there were moments that were funny and somewhat outrageous, but as a comedy it just didn&apos;t do the trick for me.\n\n&quot;The Joneses&quot;, for me, is the type of movie that you watch it once, then bag it and tag it, never to see it again. To me, the story didn&apos;t have enough value for a second viewing.",

I&apos;m from South Taiwan, and quite often frequented the town here the movie takes place.\n\nThere are indeed a bunch of Taiwanese humor, and due to such may be difficult for those who are not so adjusted to the culture to understand.\n\nThe plot was touching, and environment VERY local--I&apos;d even call it authentic. It&apos;s not exactly an OMG AMAZING script, as plenty of Japanese cartoon (anime), with which many Taiwnese are familiar with, and a lot of older Taiwnese stories that are based around the general plot. However, that is not to say the movie wasn&apos;t creative, as it is arguable that there are only 5 stories, and seemingly infinite ways to present them.\n\nI personally loved the movie. It was touching, and admittedly, I cried--from flooding nostalgia of memories past.\n\nBecause the majority of the movie is based on Taiwanese culture, it is definitely a hard one to push internationally, especially in the western part of the world.\n\nHowever, I felt that a movie like Cape No. 7 was long overdue in Taiwan, and believe that it is a first step for Taiwan to take to gain international footing in the movie industry.",

THIS is a movie that deserves a theater release. A very intelligent thriller, with a superb cast that tells a very dark story. The 3 main actors, especially Brittany Murphy, really did an excellent job. The story is told in a flashback/memento way and is executed perfectly. I felt all the flashbacks were correctly positioned and the conclusion might not blow you away- but it&apos;s pretty damn good. There are numerous twists and turns but the final twist is jaw-dropping. I want more thrillers like this! 10/10",

A truly beautiful actress playing Pauline, not afraid of extended nude scenes, Her trials and tribulations (the subject is frigidity) with husband Tommy on their first wedding anniversary are arousing and sensitively portrayed, overcoming the drawbacks of dubbed English-dialog.\n\nAlmost as good is an extended segment about unfulfilled Claudia, whose husband Martin does not satisfy her in bed after seven years of marriage. Her fantasies of sex and trysts with various guys is the stuff porn is made of, but director F.J. Gottlieb handles the material tastefully."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Max Ophuls&apos; most ingenious works, bristling with good humour and wit, in a plot that knots itself up in a kaleidoscope of innovations, and yet it all holds together, in what must be one of the most marvellous comedies ever realized on film. A great party is set off to celebrate the engagement of a well-to-do girl with a rich and well situated man, and her mother is the chief of the occasion. Without being invited, two ghosts feel they can&apos;t miss this occasion, and it&apos;s her father and her mother&apos;s previous lover. Both are dead of course, but they take part in the celebration nonetheless and enjoy both champagne and brandy. Two butlers almost become aware of their existence, as they are confused by doors opening by themselves and the sound of a champagne bottle being uncorked obviously by itself. It appears that both these ghost men were not happy about the woman they loved, hilarious marriage scenes being exposed and the dilemma of the lover, an artist at the circus dealing with tigers, which doesn&apos;t end too well. As they discuss their frustrations with that woman, a third man appears denouncing them for their abuse of such a glorious woman, and it appears he knew her before either of them. An airplane also plays some important part in all this, as it is driven by the daughter&apos;s secret lover, the unhappy daughter who doesn&apos;t want to marry that rich old man at all. The three ghosts decide to do something about it, and then at last they manage to get some contact with the mother, the woman they all three loved, and she settles the matter - or at least makes an important move that proves decisive.\n\nThis film is a wonder of cinematic invention and also human psychology, they are all presented with great typically Ophulesque ironic but warm humour, and there are lots of very hilarious scenes and details. The music is perfectly adapted to all this, constantly changing, both in tunes and in rhythm, and you will recognize many of the great melodies of the 30s. In brief, this is yet another of Max Ophuls&apos; many masterpieces, - and in some respects the most brilliant of them all.",

Dorothy Burgess, (Tonia Maria) is the girl friend of Cisco Kid and gives a great supporting role as a gold digger who wants plenty of gold, romance and any man who desires her charm. Edmund Lowe, (Sergeant Mickey Dunn) plays a soldier who is hunting down the Cisco Kid and gets himself involved with Tonia Maria in order to set up a trap to catch the Cisco Kid. Sgt.Mickey Dunn is from New York and talks and sings about the Bowery and brags about the cost of a beer for only five (5) cents and all the food you can eat. It is nice to know that Warner Baxter won an Oscar for his performance as the Cisco Kid, who was also the star of many &quot;Crime Doctor&quot; films as Dr. Ordway. This is a great classic film that you will not want to miss from 1928 and also has sound for the voices. Enjoy",

      "reviewBody": "While my German is still a work in progress, I recently saw this film on German TV, and found it really interesting. It reminded me a bit of Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears, in that it&apos;s a 1970s &quot;women&apos;s film&quot; that deals with questions of personal identity versus national identity, friendship versus sexual relationships, and women&apos;s and men&apos;s respective, and changing, roles.\n\nAnd while much of the film reads (at least to me) as camp today, at the same time, there are some really interesting bits. First, it has a number of montage sequences showing East Berlin in the 1970s, which are amazing to look at today, now that, 16 years after re-unification, these neighborhoods have changed drastically. Second, the protagonist&apos;s subjectivity -- her interior conflicts, memory &quot;flashbacks,&quot; and emotional responses to changes in her life -- are often communicated by montage sequences where all kinds of different techniques are used. For example, there are fantasy sequences which are represented clearly as &quot;a theatre of the mind,&quot; with stage-show like staging and dramatization, while other cut-away sequences use montage-type techniques in a more properly &quot;cinematic&quot; style. I&apos;d guess that these are intended as &quot;Brechtian&quot; gestures, and because Brecht is so often mis-represented in &quot;Western&quot; drama and cinema, I&apos;d like to know more about this possibility.\n\nFinally, the soundtrack, with songs by Veronica Fischer and Nina Hagen, is amazing.\n\nI&apos;ve checked a DEFA catalog that I get in the mail regularly, but this hasn&apos;t been re-released, at least in the U.S. distributors&apos; catalogs, as far as I can see. In any case, it&apos;s a great time capsule that presents issues that are still relevant; I&apos;d love to see an English-subtitled version.",

      "reviewBody": "Madhur Bhandarkar has given it all raw. But the best part is he hasn&apos;t forgotten to give the ingredients. It has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now. Page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it.\n\nMadhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and enjoys her work. A simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate Pearl. She covers the Page 3 (Celebrity Page) of Nation Today, where she has a very supportive editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani.) But life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from Page 3 and goes into Crime bit. Omigosh! a whole new world was waiting for her there. She is shocked, excited, stunned with the revelation. Her reaction has resulted in losing the job. At the end she is back to Page 3. Now when she meets any celebrity in a party, she knows the actual looks of each, hidden under the illusive face.\n\nThe movie has a message and it is crude. The audience needs to get it in their own color. The theme and the screenplay was fantastic. There are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences. Like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition, the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom. The dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it. Charu Mohanty&apos;s 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity, it leaves an impact. The set selections could have been better. The songs don&apos;t stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background. Atul Kulkarni has a small role with high-impact. There were a few flaws visible. Atul Kulkarni explaining Konkan Sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence. There could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach. The meeting between Thapar and his daughter doesn&apos;t call for acting. That scene looks very unprofessional.\n\nOverall it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident. That may spoil your mood.",

      "reviewBody": "When I watch Kung Fu films I usually like to take off my thinking cap and drown myself in action and cheesy plots. Very rarely do I encounter a Kung Fu film where I find myself confused when the ending comes, and this is exactly where I found myself at the end of Ten Tigers of Kwangtung. This film has one of the greatest Shaw Brothers casts of all time. Ti Lung, Fu Sheng and the Venoms are the lead actors and are all in top form. In case you haven&apos;t see it is about a group of fighters teaming up to protect a Ching loyalist. The group of fighters will eventually come to be known as the Ten Tigers and safely guide this Ming rebel to the South to meet with his troops. There are a lot of plot twists and betrayls in between all of this. There are a lot of flashbacks in this film. It starts off in the present time with Ming loyalists trying to kill off the disciples of the Ten Tigers and flashes back to why they want to kill them. The flashbacks show in detail how the Tigers were formed and the film does it&apos;s best to develop each character. The knock on this film is that there are too many characters, flashbacks and plot twists. These are the reasons why this film is great IMO and maybe even the greatest. There aren&apos;t many Kung Fu films that you have to watch a few times to really understand and the fighting is top notch. If you haven&apos;t seen it be sure to watch it and if you have seen it watch again, more than once",

I like the ironic approach of both script and direction towards these people who thought about themselves as revolutionaries when they were still only a group of bourgeois youngsters looking for their way. The characters were excellently drawn and the dynamics inside the group - especially the psychological pressure put on the others by Andreas Baader - were well conveyed.\n\nThe film has some important flaws though, especially concerning the script and the plotline.\n\nI did not understand for example why the storyline had to stray away in the second half from the historical events to a mythical depiction - like in the &apos;heroic&apos; ending or in the obviously fictitious meeting between police chief Krone and Baader in the night on the road.\n\nBut the major flaw of this film is for me that it never addressed all the murders and abductions the RAF conducted, it never put forward that very moment when they really became a lot of unscrupulous terrorists from a bunch of disoriented young people dreaming about the revolution.\n\nAll in all a watchable, well made biopic that still leaves a bad taste in the mouth as it abandons at times an exact depiction of historical events to myths and fairy tales.",

      "reviewBody": "This is another weird and bizarre Japanese superheroes movie by Takashi Miike. And that is the main drive of this movie, which is the weirdness. So this is basically a live action adaptation of a 70&apos;s cartoon show. Kind of like &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, except way more cheesy. I don&apos;t know how close of an essence this movie has with the cartoon. But despite the cheesy Saturday morning cartoon vibe going. Most of the humor and focus is actually on the adult themes. Especially with the direct or indirect sexual references. The plot is about these duo that goes by Yatterman. Which is composed of a male and a female characters that is dressed in a superheroes engineer costumes and masks. One wields a kendama and the other a electric stick. And has a sidekick giant robotic dog with them that gets beat up constantly unless it gets a mechanical bone from Yatterman. And goes around trying the save the world once a week. By these team rocket duos. Except it&apos;s a trio in this one, which is composed of. Wario and Waluigi with Batwoman as the leader. Or at least looks like it. The plot is narrow, predictable and very childish. It&apos;s like a script for a children&apos;s video game. Which is fine for a video game, but not much for a live action movie. Despite the wackiness, it felt like I was just sitting through this movie just to pass the time. In another words, it&apos;s kinda dull. I am not sure if the cartoon this movie got adapted from is weird, bizarre, and has that adult themes to it. But those elements is what saves this movie from being just plain bad. Since I couldn&apos;t tell sometimes if this movie is directed towards kids or adults. The production value is decent for these types of movies from japan. Although the CGI can be awful at times(I guess that sorta adds to the cartoony feel of this flick though). Maybe fans of the cartoon show this movie is adapted from might enjoy this. Overall this movie is a very simple movie that has a lot of stuff going on. It&apos;s a passable movie but not that entertaining or enjoyable. There simply isn&apos;t a moment in this film that would wow or amaze anyone or even simply find it cool. It&apos;s basically like watching a passable episode of a children&apos;s cartoon show. Except it&apos;s drawn out with bunch of weird, bizarre imagery with adult themes. And that basically sums up this disappointing movie. That is just maybe worth a rental and nothing more.\n\n6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Easily the most interesting of Pyun&apos;s Nemesis movies, Nemesis 4 at least tries to be a little different from all the other android killer movies which have gone straight to video since the success of &apos;The Terminator&apos;. The film is too short &amp; too much talking takes place, but when the action comes it&apos;s worth the wait, especially if you&apos;re a fan of female muscle. The star, pro bodybuilder Sue price spends the bulk of the film naked as she dispatches her android enemies,usually by crushing them between her impressive thighs. Maybe this is due to in the two previous movies, she didn&apos;t seem to be in the best physical shape,had to wear unflattering costumes &amp; her hair in awful plaits which would have made even the most glamorous woman look like a guy. I feel the reviewer who commented that a man must have been used for some of Price&apos;s scenes is being extremely disrespectful to an athlete who has trained hard for years to gain the kind of muscularity most men would envy, while staying feminine (do men have breasts where this person lives?).  The acting isn&apos;t very good, but it&apos;s rare you see good acting anywhere these days. In all the film looks like it was some kind of muscle showcase for Price &amp; perhaps there was enough footage to turn it into another installment. This was obviously produced on a tiny budget (there are only two locations), but despite this, the camera work is highly professional with some stunning shots of Sue Price. It&apos;s no classic by any means, but it&apos;s enjoyably unusual &amp; a must for female muscle fans."

We have seen that kind of setting before, in &quot;The Thing&quot; and a dozen other movies where a crew is isolated in a strange place where weird things start to happen. It&apos;s the memory of those far superior movies that make this one watchable at first. However, the story drags on and it all goes downhill soon.\n\nThe mysterious ongoings aren&apos;t really that intriguing, and they get less intriguing the more they are exposed. On top of that, Ron Perlman&apos;s character is annoying and unbelievable. He&apos;s just a constant pain in the a.., just for the hell of it. The worst part about &quot;The Last Winter&quot;, however, is the resolution or rather the lack thereof. It seems as if director/writer whatshisface hadn&apos;t thought the whole thing through and just decided to go ahead with filming because the topic of global warming is so trendy right now.\n\nWell, it&apos;s a pity. &quot;The Last Winter&quot; could have been a solid mystery/thriller. Instead it&apos;s an unsatisfying waste of your time. There are far too many good movies out there waiting to be watched for you to rent this one.",

Kusturica&apos;s humor is sharp and true. The most funny for me in this film was a place with international &quot;peacekeeping&quot; organizations , there &quot;role&quot; in solving of conflicts, &quot;saving&quot; people.

Dull acting, one dimensional characters, boring scenes, and recycled material from other movies make this film one of the worse possession / exorcism films that I have ever seen. \n\nTrying to get through the first half of this movie is a painful process I would not like to repeat/. I did not even have the curiosity to fast forward the movie to find out how it ended.\n\nReading other people&apos;s reviews here, make me realize I am not the only one that feels the same way. I also find interesting other people struggled to get to the half way mark of this movie.\n\nI think the makers of the movie had a good idea but it was delivered poorly..",

The acting is very nuanced, especially from the lead character.\n\nThe sci-fi background story is just a means to explain the alienation the people &quot;from the future&quot; face.\n\nSaid that it&apos;s a hard watch. I almost turned it off a few times. Why? It&apos;s too arthouse in its bland and depressing depiction of dire problems.\n\nThe situation starts as bad and gets worse. The silver linings turn out to be mirages. Life is hard and this movie is very realistic about it. So in case you are down already watch something else more uplifting.\n\nIn case you&apos;re mentally stable and open minded there are many lessons to learn from this. I just wish they made them less painful. It&apos;s a character study for the heroic viewer.",

God only knows what went wrong. Perhaps it&apos;s too ambitious - it really tries to look like an American big budget musical, where showstopper chases showstopper and big production numbers seem to have swallowed a lot of money. But the storyline is weak, and Dora Komar, who might have been pretty good on the big stage, is incredibly tiresome to watch. The film stumbles under its own weight, and you won&apos;t miss much if you fail to see it - save some really good songs. But there are better entries in the series."

      "reviewBody": "Heartbreakers is a very special movie for me being an artist myself I could relate to some of the dialog in the movie. I remember going to see this movie by myself at the age of 21. I usually go to movies by myself if I felt that it would be too strange for my date. Art films like this are strange to the typical person and I didn&apos;t have to worry about anyone else not enjoying it. I live in Chicago and at that time it was about 3 art movie theaters that would show a movie like this, which, I&apos;m very grateful for living in a big city and be able to see it then. \n\nI connect to this movie in every way from the title, the male friendship, the music, the attractive ladies, the story and the strange artwork. Heartbreakers is the perfect title for the film because all the characters were selfish and unapologetic with their love. The friendship with Blu (Peter Coyote) and Eli (Nick Mandcuso) seem so authentic and at that time I felt similar to my own friendship I had with someone I grew up with. The music at that time didn&apos;t impress me but now that I gotten older I have a better appreciation for it. The art gallery receptionist was very sexy She stayed on my mind for a while after seeing the movie and when I look at the movie now she still look sexy. I though the other women Blu&apos;s ex-girlfriend and Blu&apos;s muse were pretty sexy back then but now not so much but still attractive. The story had everything I wanted with romance, betrayal, friendship and payoff for perseverance. The artwork was hauntingly dark and sexy it was something I never seen before a big-breasted woman in lingerie painted in black and white Oh, that was new creative territory for me. At that time I didn&apos;t know anything about Bettie Page but recently a movie came out about her and then I put two and two together. \n\nI bought the VHS version of Heartbreakers but I&apos;m eagerly waiting for it to go on DVD. I guess I will have to check out this Bettie Page movie until Heartbreakers make it onto DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is as much about a time and a place as it is about its characters. The time is the 1940s and the place is a small mining community in Quebec, Canada, at Christmas time. The movie has such an air of authenticity that I felt that I had gotten a glimpse into what life was like in that community at that time.\n\nThe story centers on the experiences of fifteen year old Benoit, an orphan living with his uncle and aunt who run a general store, as well as a funeral parlor. Also living there is Carmen, a young woman of Benoit&apos;s age. Most transitions from adolescence to adulthood take years, but Benoit goes a long way to making that transition in a matter of a couple of days. The events that transpire in those days change Benoit from a rather carefree innocence to a sober appreciation of the complexities of life and death. We are witness to the joys, frustrations and sorrows of the people we meet.\n\nBenoit&apos;s youthful experiences are universal in the large (sexual awakening, death, duplicitous behavior, dashed expectations), but they are unique to him and that uniqueness is what makes coming of age stories ceaselessly interesting. There is a scene where Benoit is chasing Carmen around among the caskets (such life amid the symbols of death) and he finally catches her as she falls to the ground. He puts a hand on her breast, exciting for him even though she is fully clothed. What happens then is one of those moments that make these experiences unique--neither Benoit nor Carmen knows quite what to do at this juncture and they wind up just staring at each other. If you cannot appreciate such a tender scene, then you will likely not appreciate this movie.\n\nSeveral themes lurk in the background. One is the friction that exists between the French and English speaking peoples of the province. After finishing a beer in a bar, one of the French Canadians says, &quot;That&apos;s one that the English will not get.&quot; The bitterness between the English speaking Quebecers and the francophone Canadians is brought home in the scene that has the English speaking mine owner tossing cheap Christmas gifts into the snow from his horse-drawn carriage. The harsh life of the mine workers is portrayed with just enough emphasis to make the point. The ugly and oppressive presence of the asbestos mine casts a somber shadow over the entire proceeding, particularly given the health consequences of the mineral.\n\nDirector Jutra chose Jacques Gagnon from the townspeople to play the role of Benoit, instead of casting a professional young actor for the role. I think this turned out to be a fortuitous choice, since Gagnon gives a surprisingly natural performance, aided by some skill-full camera work. Many of the local townspeople appear in the movie, adding to the feeling of authenticity; the use of natural lighting adds to this as well.\n\nSeveral people have accused this movie of having no plot. I am always puzzled what such people mean by that. This movie presents a sequence of interrelated events leading to a dramatic final scene. To me that is a plot. I wish some of these plot deniers would spell out what they mean by their comment. Maybe I could see the charge sticking when applied to a movie like Warhol&apos;s &quot;Empire&quot; (a continuous shot of New York&apos;s Empire State Building for eight hours and five minutes), but not to this movie.\n\nI found this engaging and altogether worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "First things first, will admit to not expecting much. The premise sounded ridiculous and it looked pretty bad. Even when trying to find some good in them, although there are good ones (&apos;Jaws&apos; being the king of them all) and some guilty pleasure ones shark films generally have not scored highly with me even when trying to take them for what they are.\n\nBefore anybody gets defensive, am well aware that films like &apos;Piranha Sharks&apos; are not ones to be taken seriously. Have seen my fair share of low-budget shark films, and any other kind of low-budget creature film, and will admit to finding some guilty fun in some of them (i.e. the first two &apos;Sharknado&apos; films). There are marginally worse shark films than &apos;Piranha Sharks&apos; certainly. Sadly &apos;Piranha Sharks&apos; is just too amateurish to accept as a guilty pleasure, where nearly everything is just poor quality that it&apos;s insulting and there is nowhere near enough fun, intentional or unintentional, moments. \n\nWas not expecting anything intelligent here, am well versed now to know that it is not that kind of film, but &apos;Piranha Sharks&apos; does feel like it was made by somebody who didn&apos;t know how to give a film brains, so much so that it&apos;ll make the viewer feel dumb and that is not a nice sensation to feel watching a film. \n\n&apos;Piranha Sharks&apos; does have a couple of small redeeming quality. The opening scene was actually pretty entertaining, something that put the viewer in the mood for some very dumb but guilty pleasure fun. Unfortunately, it rapidly fell downhill, where ridiculousness and cheapness amongst other things were taken to extremes. \n\nKevin Sorbo also tries his best to inject some energy into his role.\n\nVisually, &apos;Piranha Sharks&apos; is yet another low-budget shark attack film that looks cheap and like it was made with no budget, heart or enthusiasm. Any nice scenery that the movie has is difficult to appreciate when the movie is shot in such a drab way and when it&apos;s edited so amateurishly that bacon-slicer-like editing looks more refined. Worst of all in this regard are the effects, as it was made on low-budget it would have been forgiven a little if it was not great, but when the effects for the shark look as if no effort was given in making them without looking so goofy and unfinished-looking that is hard to ignore.\n\nThe opening scene apart, so the shark&apos;s lack of presence or personality, it&apos;s not menacing, it&apos;s not scary and it&apos;s not fun, it&apos;s not even strong enough to bring any unintentional humour or goofiness, that&apos;s how bland it is. The music is very generic and adds very little, it&apos;s not always appropriate either and quite a lot of it is actually pretty annoying.\n\nWriting ranges between incredibly bad to appalling. Any comedy is incredibly forced and is so cheesy it is enough to make the eyes roll in disbelief, while the more serious moments are very awkwardly written and as trite as anybody can possibly go. Regarding the shark attacks, some are rushed, others are badly drawn out. They lack any kind of suspense and the over-silliness to the point of intelligence-insulting stupidity, terrible shark effects, bad editing and even more gratuitous gore further cheapen them. \n\nDescribing the story as weak is being too insulting to the word weak, it is a very lethargically paced and thin as ice story with lots of padding that is either badly written or serves no point at all to the movie, other than attempts at novelty value, which falls flat on its face because it all feels so tired. It is not fun, it is not scary and it is not thrilling or suspenseful, it&apos;s just nothing but tired stupidity.\n\nAs for the characters, that they&apos;re tired cliches isn&apos;t so much a problem, the problem is that they are either obnoxious with them constantly doing stupid things, so bland that it makes zombies seem more animated or both. Some of them are superfluous to the story or come and go out of nowhere constantly. The direction is as flat as a pancake, and the acting is amateur hour awful, apart from Kevin Sorbo trying his best.\n\nOverall, a mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

And of course black actors wanted to have their own exploitation. Here we have a very good example what we call blaxploitation. But this here is really good. Naturally the main leads are black people but the one to look out to is Tamara Dobson. She was a natural beauty but sadly she became sick and stopped making movies in 1984. She died of her disease which was MS in 2006. Here she&apos;s Cleopatra Jones, let&apos;s just say a black 007. But look how the feature was made, back in those days they knew how to do their stuff, no CGI or other stupid effects, here&apos;s it&apos;s the real stuff but here it&apos;s effects in the attacks and the many fights. Don&apos;t think that you will see a serious amount of blood, no it doesn&apos;t. But of course for the seventies nudity was a normal thing and it contains some nudity. But also have a look at Cleopatra&apos;s clothes and the way they put some make-up on her. The score, pure seventies, this is excellent stuff. I can&apos;t say anything that I didn&apos;t like in it. The chases with the cars and motorcycles, it goes on for minutes. You can guess it, one to watch",

One could legitimately criticize the art direction as being derivative of &quot;Se7en&quot; or &quot;Saw,&quot; but why bother? The writing, the direction, and particularly the acting are so far superior to the vast majority of the horror/thriller/suspense movies that are churned out by the hundreds these days that you&apos;d be denying yourself the chance to see an intelligent, thought-provoking, not unbelievable, suspenseful film if you passed on it for that reason.\n\nIt is, psychologically, dark; and there are a few scenes of torture - but they aren&apos;t gratuitous and they aren&apos;t gratuitously gory. They are essential to advancing the plot and developing the characters; and most of the violence is implied, not shown. If you&apos;re looking for torture porn, you&apos;ll be disappointed.\n\nThe plot twists are interesting, atypical, and believable, and the movie has something significant and thought-provoking to say about the human condition. The characters (with the exception of Melissa George&apos;s) are written with moral complexity, and all of the acting (including Ms. George&apos;s) is top-notch.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame this didn&apos;t get a theatrical release in the U.S. Judging from the disappointment of torture-porn fans, my guess is that it was not well-marketed.",

There is nothing hilarious here, but some lines and scenes are funny and very pleasant, plus some moments are touching. The film looks great, has a beautiful soundtrack and a story to warm the heart, and it has a script that has its humorous and sweet parts. The film is short but not too short, and it is snappily paced. The children are very believable, Myrna Loy doesn&apos;t have as much to do but is suitably warm and sympathetic and Clifton Webb is absolutely wonderful. All in all, still a joy. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

His films are almost always visually splendid, but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry. Watch his movies in fast forward, the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or the characters, using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare&apos;s original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes. There is none of the romance, magic, trickery, or urgency the script calls for, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts, similar to Gaveston in Jarman&apos;s Edward II. It is too bad that this is just about the only film version of The Tempest available.",

This one is the follow-up of &quot;The Glass-Bottom Boat&quot; and is in every case bigger an greater, but not better. Frank Tashlin did a very good job, when he first cooperated with Doris but he used her for his crazy and hardly understandable sense of humor. You have to laugh about the whole movie, you can&apos;t take anything in it seriously. That&apos;s the trick of it. There are very funny moments, e. g. when Doris goes to cinema to watch &quot;Caprice&quot; and when she strikes again a sexual attack. Perhaps a few of you really enjoy this movie as I do. Take it easy and with a little smile. For all others: Doris didn&apos;t like the movie herself.",

MYSTERY MEN is a send-up of every superhero flick you&apos;ve ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men -- including one Mystery Woman -- are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and onto the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer, and say &quot;huh?&quot; more than once.... enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "I have often said in previous reviews of Indian movies that I am certainly no expert. Having not grown up in India, it&apos;s not surprising that I only began watching Indian films in the last 10 years or so. That&apos;s because they just weren&apos;t readily available here in the States. But, because so many wonderful films are made in India, it&apos;s not surprising that sooner or later they&apos;d make their way over here.\n\nVeer Pratap Singh is the beloved lord of his town. As the film begins, the townspeople are having a HUGE party to celebrate the lord&apos;s birthday and to thank him for his benevolence. However, a young man interrupts the party and announces that Singh is a tyrant. At first you think the guy might just be a nut as EVERYONE loves the lord. However, as the film progresses you see more and more signs that the master of the town is indeed a total jerk-face--and not only is a crook and liar, but he mocks the gods. And, again and again, you think as you watch &apos;this guy is gonna get his real soon....&quot;--but it sure takes a while. In the meantime, the hatred of the wicked lord has spread slowly and only five men, one woman (who the lord has impregnated) and an odd character who is a mystical brother of Singh stand up against them. What&apos;s to happen? See the film.\n\nI enjoyed watching &quot;Hum Paanch&quot; very much--it kept my attention from start to finish. However, at the same time I can understand its very ordinary current rating of 6.0, as the film has a couple problems compared to the more modern Indian films I have seen. The most obvious is when the characters sing. Compared to the more modern Indian films, the sound quality is horrible and sounds, literally, like they are singing into tin cans! It sounds very fake and there isn&apos;t a lot to enjoy about these interludes. Normally, I really LIKE the songs--here in &quot;Hum Paanch&quot;, I didn&apos;t. Second, the story took way too long to resolve itself. While you knew what must happen in the end, this ending just took too long and had too many diversions. Now I know that at a little under three hours &quot;Hum Paanch&quot; is actually shorter than most Indian films today, but in most of these longer ones I&apos;ve seen, the film maintains its momentum. Here, it dragged a bit. Enjoyable but far from a must-see.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot; starring Gary Cooper and Merle Oberon was written after Sam Goldwyn thought up the title - so it&apos;s the reverse of the usual process. It&apos;s a 1938 film about a wealthy, sheltered young woman (Oberon) whose father is about to announce his candidacy for President. One night, she slips out for a night of fun with her uncle (Harry Davenport). When her name is discovered on a list of people who were in attendance at a club during a raid, she is sent out of town so her father can say she wasn&apos;t in town at the time. Since her name is Mary Smith, it could easily be another person.\n\nWhile on her vacation, Mary meets a tall, gorgeous hunk of man - a cowboy named Stretch Willoughby (Gary Cooper). As any red-blooded woman would do, she falls for him. It&apos;s young Gary Cooper. He&apos;s a hottie. To put them in the same class, she says she&apos;s a maid. Before she knows it, she&apos;s married to him.\n\nThe stars are very good in the film, as is Harry Davenport as the uncle with a twinkle in his eye. Cooper and Oberon are darling together - he&apos;s so tall and broad-shouldered and she&apos;s beautiful and petite, and they have a nice chemistry. When she first asks him about himself, Stretch answers with Cooper&apos;s famous &quot;Yep&quot; several times. Parts of the film are a little slow but it&apos;s a nice romance. I realize some people think it&apos;s a preposterous love story but I can see any woman, rich or poor, flipping out for Gary Cooper and any guy falling for Merle Oberon. They were, after all, two of Hollywood&apos;s great beauties.\n\nVery enjoyable.",

Executioners isn&apos;t quite as good but might be more interesting - set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, filled with crazed corporate owners, assassinations, bandits, and renegade military personel, this is a film that has a lot of ambition. It&apos;s also deeply flawed, if only because it&apos;s a bit messy and many of the characters&apos; relationships and plot lines are confusing. But it does have some remarkable action scenes, great performances again by Yeoh, Mui, and Cheung, and a surprisingly dark ending that works very well. Anthony Wong also has some fun as the villain, a madman who owns the water company(!). He&apos;s completely unrecognisable behind the makeup and iron mask he wears, but he&apos;s having a good time. If you like The Heroic Trio, this is well worth checking out. It&apos;s not that film&apos;s equal, but it is an above-average action film in its own right.",

      "reviewBody": "Hammer movies seem to divide horror fans. You either dig them or you don&apos;t, and I most certainly do! In my opinion even the weaker movies from that studio are still worth a look, and &apos;Twins Of Evil&apos; is one of the better ones, and therefore essential viewing. It may not be as great as &apos;The Vampire Lovers&apos;, which it has a tenuous link to (it isn&apos;t really a &quot;sequel&quot; as such but also deals with the wicked Karnstein family, so if you haven&apos;t seen the former, don&apos;t sweat it), but it&apos;s still damn entertaining. Horror legend and Hammer regular Peter Cushing puts in a strong performance as the overly zealous witchfinder Gustav Weil. He always can be depended upon to take the material seriously, sometimes more seriously than it deserves. The Collinson twins who play his nieces are pretty and can act adequately, but show nowhere near as much flesh as you might expect. They may be the stars according to the title of the movie but are easily overshadowed by Cushing and cult figures Dennis Price (Franco&apos;s &apos;Vampyros Lesbos&apos;, the Vincent Price black comedy &apos;Theatre Of Blood&apos;) and David Warbeck (Fulci&apos;s &apos;The Black Cat&apos; and &apos;The Beyond&apos;, and Russ Meyer&apos;s little seen &apos;Blacksnake!&apos;). The rest of the supporting cast are all fine, especially Damien Thomas as the decadent Count Karnstein. As I said &apos;Twins Of Evil&apos; didn&apos;t impress me as much as &apos;The Vampire Lovers&apos; which I still think is THE Hammer vampire classic, but along with &apos;Vampire Circus&apos; it is an underrated movie that deserves to be seen by every horror buff. Director John Hough incidentally went on to make the frightening &apos;Legend Of Hell House&apos; and the cult Peter Fonda road movie &apos;Dirty Mary Crazy Larry&apos;. &apos;Twins Of Evil&apos; is yet another solid effort from the much loved Hammer studios."

Sigourney Weaver, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kristen Bell and Odette Yustman all shine on-screen in their own ways, yet complement each other so well. The chemistry of the cast contributes to the film&apos;s charm. I was especially impressed with Kristen Bell because this is the first comedy/chick-flick I&apos;ve personally seen her in, and she was really cute and funny! She had a lot of charm, great comedic timing, and I kept thinking in my head how gorgeous she is all throughout the movie. She&apos;s a really versatile actress. The veterans, Sigourney, Jamie Lee, and Betty White were all hilarious as well. If you&apos;re looking for a fun, positive family film with lots of laughs, you&apos;ve found your movie.",

The crew of the U.S. ship Shenandoah crashes on the lunar surface, only to find the Germans beat them there. But strange things are abound as the German ship is deserted except for a pesky alien. Lone survivor Hans (Klaus Kinski) tells of the horror his crew encountered from a mind controlling alien, but no one is quick enough to combat it this go around either. It&apos;s probably been about 20 years since I last saw this and this low budget production has held up really well. Director Malone is definitely trying to ape Ridley Scott&apos;s trend setter, but he ups the gore factor substantially. Malone also seems to be having fun here, as evidenced by the female lead coming up with a way to kill the creature by recalling a screening of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951). He even has a character reading a novelization of his debut feature SCARED TO DEATH (1981). The cast is good with the great Kinski doing his psycho German guy routine (shocking, right?). I wonder if he caused problems on the set as his character disappears, but then comes back zombified with clearly a double in his place."

The whole film was a mockery of what made the series great and I actually had to see it over several viewings to get the whole film (my brother has it on tape). I have great respect for the actors in the film but they all suck (except Jan Linnebjerg who always brings a lot of humor and comedy to his character). The story is ridiculously bad even for a children&apos;s movie and the (anti)climax is pretty obvious even from the beginning.\n\nAll in all if you liked the series don&apos;t watch the movie. \n\n2/10",

The camera work is unusual and the soundtrack adds to the effect.  The locations are very cold and isolated which takes you into the mind of the lead character.  J.P.

The direction and acting is steady with no real stand out performance and the characters seem a bit flat at times but the shots of Tasmania&apos;s isolated country side are fantastic and set a haunting tale. This formula has been applied countless times so there&apos;s nothing new here but its done well serving up some good blood and guts and proves along with Wolf creek that Aussie film can do horror.

      "reviewBody": "Originally intended as the first of an &quot;Anthology Of Fear&quot; series of films, THE DOOR &amp; THE BUTCHER&apos;S WIFE was the only one lensed and although it&apos;s not bad, it&apos;s also not hard to see why there were no further entries.\n\nIn THE DOOR, the guests at a hip housewarming party open a closet and find a corridor with a shadowy naked man who tries to get out when the door is opened but goes back where he came from when it&apos;s closed. Except for one couple that leaves, the party-goers don&apos;t seem overly concerned as they continue to eat, drink, and ponder the nature of the beast in a surreal scene not unlike those found in Luis Buñuel&apos;s THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL. Things get stranger still when the younger guests, tired of dancing to music by &quot;The Jokers&quot;, use the door for a party game.\n\nTHE BUTCHER&apos;S WIFE is set during the Mexican Revolution and is a bit more lavish with a train robbery, Villa&apos;s men fighting the Federales, and the decimation of a small town to keep things moving. Revolutionaries rob the train to buy much needed arms but when the go-between carrying the money is murdered by a village butcher and his greedy wife, she makes off with the gold while he&apos;s left with a guilty conscience that, with the help of some mescal, threatens to destroy him.\n\nBoth stories have great promise but the intriguing premises dead-end with denouements that are too open-ended to be satisfying. The first of the half-told tales is similar to what U.S. audiences were getting from national TV at the time, most notably in series like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and the second one&apos;s a bizarre blend of BONANZA and Edgar Alan Poe&apos;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;. The proposed &quot;Anthology Of Fear&quot; series ended with the first installment most likely because it offered nothing new, as well-made as it was. &quot;Guest star&quot; Katy Jurado, 44 at the time, was quite striking as the buxom butcher&apos;s wife and, with her long black hair and off-the-shoulder peasant blouse, was reminiscent of Bette Davis as Rosa Moline in BEYOND THE FOREST. One of the directors of this segment, Chano Urueta, also played an old priest who holds a key to the mystery.",

      "reviewBody": "Universal&apos;s 46th sound-era film was the third and last of their serials...From the ALEX RAYMOND newspaper feature owned and copyrighted by King Features Syndicate...starring Buster Crabbe as &quot;Flash Gordon.&quot; All featured loose adaptations of their Sunday comic page continuities but this one stayed pretty close to the long-running segment devoted to Prince Barin&apos;s Kingdom of Arboria and the Ice Kingdom of Frigia ruled by The Ice Queen, both on the planet Mongo.\n\nThis one takes off when the Earth is visited by a deadly epidemic known as the Plague of the Purple Death, easily diagnosed as it leaves a purple spot on the foreheads of its victims. Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe), Dale Arden (Carol Hughes) and Dr. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) zoom out in Zarkov&apos;s rocket ship and make a straight-space bee-line for Mongo, where the ruthless ruler, Ming the Merciless (Charles Middleton) is spreading death dust in Earth&apos;s atmosphere as part of his plan to CONQUER THE UNIVERSE. Actually, he had two kingdoms on his own planet he didn&apos;t rule, but Ming had a severe case of the hots for Dale Arden from Day One, and he probably figured he could take care of the rebel kingdoms after he made the lured-back Dale his bride and, thusly inspired, take care of Arboria and Frigia in one fell swoop along with the remainder of the Universe. The man knew how to set priorities.\n\nUpon arriving on Mongo, Flash, Dale and Zarkov visit their old friends Prince Barin (played by Roland Drew, and two Roland Drews weren&apos;t equal to Dick Alexander&apos;s Prince Barin) and his wife Aura (Shirley Dean, formerly of The Jones Family at TC-F), who was also Ming&apos;s daughter, who has been reformed by Barin&apos;s love and the realization that her father is one stark-mad, raving lunatic...and horny to boot.\n\nThe family touches and relationships between the primary characters---Flash may have had a little thing going on with Aura back in the early days of the strip when she was the total spoiled-rotten daughter and supporter of her father, and they were still exchanging Sunday glances for years even after she married Barin--- and the creation of a Queen Glenda of Frigia (Clarice Sherry) ruling over an Ice Kingdom (that one strike any chords with a 2005 film) show that Alex Raymond&apos;s plot-writing skills were on par with his top-flight illustration abilities. All of his comic strips, including &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; were aimed at adults, and the kids could figure it out later on their own. Some of us never did. \n\nGlenda The Ice Queen, on Sundays for certain, also had an eye on General Lupi (William Royle), the commander-in-chief of her army, or he was until he ended up in one of Ming&apos;s dungeons, and wasn&apos;t doing much in the way of commanding when Flash &amp; Company showed up. In fact, Ming&apos;s scientists have perfected the Purple Death Dust to the point where it only kills those with intelligence enough to pose a threat to Ming, while only making slaves out of the less intelligent. This, clearly, posed a threat for all the citizens of Earth with all the population doomed to become slaves, but Ming wasn&apos;t a man who liked to take chances, except where Dale Arden was concerned. Well, his stooge scientists tell him that this is what they have done, but Ming wants proof and they are about to experiment on General Lupi. Flash, of course, rescues him and this makes the thawed-out Ice Queen happy, and she grants Flash and Zarkov the right to mine Polarite, the antidote to the Purple Death Dust, in her kingdom. After a few incidents with avalanches and &quot;annihilants&quot; Flash mines enough Polarite to save the Earth, and he makes a quick day-trip back there and deposits the life-saving Polarite on top of Mt. McKinley. (Hey, settle down...it&apos;s stock footage McKinley and not a location site.) But, back on Mongo, things aren&apos;t going all that smooth and there are still many chapters to go. Somewhere toward the end, Zarkov defies Ming by informing him that his and Flash&apos;s mission is to not only save the world (Earth) but the Universe as well. Ming, always the one to indulge in tirades, even when things are going his way, scoffs: &quot;The universe? I AM THE UNIVERSE!&quot; Charles Middleton&apos;s eyes probably lit up when he saw that line in the script.\n\n(Those of you who don&apos;t know how this one ends might want to move on to something else, now)....as they fly back to the safety of Arboria and then back to Earth, Prince Barin tells Flash: &quot;By destroying Ming, you have saved the universe.&quot; and Flash replies...&quot;In his mad ambition, Ming declared that HE WAS the universe.&quot; And Zarkov says, &quot;Then, since you are the conquerer of Ming, I shall radio your father: Flash Gordon conquers the universe!&quot; \n\nAnd Dale, not knowing an exit line when she hears one adds...&quot;And saves the Earth.&quot; \n\nWe thought he saved the Earth several chapters back when he deposited the Polarite atop of Mt. McKinley. Oh, that&apos;s correct...Ming later came up with Solarite.\n\nHey, the dialogue and character&apos;s alone overcome any &quot;so-called&quot; 1940&apos;s cheesy special effects. Nine out of ten...only because of the covered-up belly buttons in this one."

Considering the era it was made in, the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people I grew up with. Yes the plot is so-so. And yes, the Acting is not going to get nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But that isn&apos;t the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN. And this movie has Fun aplenty. From the greedy,uncaring banker to the well meaning,but dimwitted deputy, this movie was made to poke fun at the SciFi genre and small town living at it&apos;s best. Who can&apos;t smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I LOVED the FarmZoid. Wish I had one when I was growing up. Overall, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a pleasant romp into one&apos;s childhood, when you could sit back on a Saturday afternoon, Popcorn in hand, and laugh at the foibles of small town living. This is a movie I would watch again and again, if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1953 composer Theo Mackeben died; he was a very good composer of songs, light (film) music, serious music etc.; he was very important for the German cinema in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s.\n\nHardly surprising then that a film about or around him would be made. However, this film is centered around the music of Mackeben, but - as the credits state - not the life of Mackeben is portrayed. In stead the &quot;bio&quot; has been replaced by a story about an invented composer who composes the music of Mackeben; the script is that bad that words fail to describe it, let us hope that Mackeben had a more interesting life and certainly wife. The cast tries hard to make something out of it, but to no avail. Ingrid Stenn, as the composer&apos;s wife, has nothing else to do than to look worried. When the wife (separated in the meantime from her husband) does not want to reveal a difficult situation she is in and in the same conversation says that lately she has had no appetite for coffee (!), the viewer is of course aware of the situation - her conversation partner is not. Who ever wrote this scene must have had a bad case of caffeine poisoning.\n\nIf you are willing to forget the story and Hans Wolff&apos;s so-so direction as well (though he directs much better than in his first films), you still could have a wonderful time with Mackeben&apos;s music and the good performances of it. You also may want to indulge in game of association, like I did during watching: \n\nMargot Hielscher superbly sings the title song and also the song &quot;Frauen sind keine Engel&quot; (incorporated in a nice revue number); this song she already sung in 1943 in the film with the same title and that was directed by Willi Forst (and I repeat what I wrote about Hielscher then: she might have been an angel herself, that voice!). And look who has a guest appearance as film director: Willi Forst for whom Hans Wolff formerly worked as editor and assistant-director. Forst refers to his own classic &quot;Bel Ami&quot; of 1939 and in his subtle and charming style sings the title song. You may want to find the association &quot;Forst and the bare breasts&quot; yourself.\n\nHis first films Hans Wolff made with Sonja Ziemann in the lead. In this film she has a guest appearance as ballet dancer and as far as I know, this film has given her the only opportunity to show herself in the profession before she turned to acting: that of ballet dancer. The production number for her may not be Hollywood standard, but it is very entertaining, well-danced and very imaginative. Other guest appearances are those of Zarah Leander (and what a fine lady she still is) and Kirsten Heilberg, whose performance of the second song (towards the end of the film) gave me shivers down my spine.\n\nOf the cast I want to mention Georg Thomalla. This is a comedian I am not always to friendly of as he has the tendency not to keep himself in check. Here however he is charming and his acting (and thus the comedy he provides) is well-timed. He also has a song-and-dance number in which he gives a very good Maurice Chevalier impersonation.\n\nAll in all: I find this a very curious film that despite the terrible script, but thanks to the spirit of Mackeben entertained me enormously.",

The characters are quirky, borderline bizzare but real. They are obstinate, boorish, brooding, insulting, conniving and philandering. Their roles are in constant conflict, but the comedy derives from It&apos;s smooth ensemble acting and impeccable timing. Some of it&apos;s shenanigans are highly cultured slapstick. Their personalities intertwine with French culture in odd ways. Perhaps that was a redundancy. I was pleasantly surprised. I&apos;m not going to say any more because I don&apos;t want to ruin it for you. You should see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Credit to Jackie, he does try to do something different with his Hong Kong films. It would be easy for him to churn out countless sequels to already established series, but he does try to vary his output. Well, that is in as much as the constraints of his fans expectations and his established film persona will allow, anyway. The Myth, as a film, suffers paradoxically because of these two things; trying to satisfy by offering something new, while fulfilling audience expectation based on Jackie&apos;s previous output. The historical side of the film works best, providing Chan with a role (Army General bound by honour, compromised by love) that is unfamiliar and more interesting largely because of that. The action is more gritty and brutal in these sequences, with lots more blood on show than in typical Jackie fare. The present day character is classic Jackie, though the comedic set pieces and brief fight scenes don&apos;t have quite the inventiveness or sparkle of yesteryear. You can imagine the glue factory scene in particular being more involving and exciting if it had been choreographed twenty, or even ten, years ago. Stanley Tong&apos;s handling of the material is, due to the nature of his script, very uneven. The presentation of the modern day settings is fine, if a little uninspiring; especially when you consider some of the film&apos;s spectacular locations. However, the historical battles look and feel dull and lack any kind of epic quality. This may have been down to budget constraints, but watching the film you feel that if more clever camera-work had been employed, this effect could have been conveyed. Ultimately, it&apos;s a pity Jackie wasn&apos;t brave enough to do a straight, serious historical action/drama, because under The Myth&apos;s familiarity there&apos;s a different Jackie Chan film trying to get out.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, what can I say? Takashi Miike&apos;s take on the whole so-called J-horror hoopla. I bet he was thinking &quot;I can do this too. And I can do it better&quot;. And you know what? He was right! RINGU can be considered as the original one that started it all (because of being the first big hit in the genre, for one thing). I&apos;m not even gonna argue about whether it&apos;s the best J-horror movie or not. But I am gonna say that ONE MISSED CALL is without a doubt, on some levels, more effective than RINGU. Where Sadako&apos;s ghostly tale of terror was sort of touching the boundaries and establishing some clearly defined characteristics of the genre, CHAKUSHIN ARI pushes the boundaries and uses these characteristics as a reference to the genre.\n\nMiike handles a very tight script and a plot that has virtually no holes and a lot of eye for details. Almost every little aspect that is being mentioned in the plot, carries a little set-up within that delivers a pay-off later. The story is intriguing. The death scenes are original and rather graphic. The ghostly creepiness is there. Every jump-scare works (there was one were I almost went through the roof! I recommend watching this with the sound turned up a notch; just let it blast out of the speakers, and I guarantee you: you will jump!). The conclusion is great and practically unpredictable; the twists were damn good. And then there&apos;s Miike, who just once again had to give this movie that Miike-touch of his, making it all just one bit more special in a way. And this time, surprisingly, he doesn&apos;t do it in the usual way. Not be inserting a sickening scene, or adding some repulsive imagery (though some events and effects really are quite gruesome). No. This time he does it by taking the movie to a different level, by adding that very last scene. And the very last shot should normally have you thinking about something that someone in a very brief scene said, earlier in the movie. The effect it had on me was: wanting to re-watch the movie. Now that&apos;s just great if a movie manages to do that. So maybe I should really rate this one 10/10. But I&apos;ll reserve that rating for THE AUDITION, my favorite Takashi Miike film ever (for now, at least).\n\nAnd, by the way: I&apos;m ready for the re-make. It&apos;s gonna be directed by Frenchman Eric Valette, who previously directed the magnificent, claustrophobic &amp; Lovecraftian-like MALÉFIQUE. For once, I just might have a little faith in an upcoming re-make.",

      "reviewBody": "A ship of fools docks in Port-au-Prince, and the disembarking passengers include a local businessman, an idealistic former U.S. presidential candidate and his wife, and a self-confident British major. The film&apos;s credentials are incredible; the cast includes Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Alec Guiness, Peter Ustinov, Lillian Gish, and James Earl Jones; Graham Greene wrote the script from his own novel; and Peter Glenville provided the taut direction. Given the talent involved, perhaps expectations raised the bar for &quot;The Comedians&quot; too high for any film to reach. Although the results do not represent a pinnacle for any of these artists, &quot;The Comedians&quot; is an engrossing tale set against the nightmarish backdrop of Papa &quot;Doc&quot; Duvalier&apos;s repressive regime in Haiti. A thick tense atmosphere envelops the film from the outset. Arrests, beatings, corpses, intimidation, bribes, murders, and threats paint Duvalier&apos;s Haiti in shades of blood and terror. In 1967, the Taylor-Burton romance was still in the tabloids, and the film&apos;s illicit romance depicted by the world-famous pair was still titillating. However, time has dimmed the scandal, and the film has benefited. Greene&apos;s story and the acting talent are no longer over-shadowed.\n\nThe still ravishing Taylor, who affects a German-accent as the wife of Ustinov, a cuckolded foreign ambassador, is involved with Burton, a local hotel owner. While arguably the least-interesting aspect of the film, their liaison is integral to the story. Meanwhile, Paul Ford and his wife, Gish, seek to establish a vegetarian center in Duvalierville, a never-will-be Utopian community, and a shady braggart with the wrong connections, Guinness, attempts an arms sale to Duvalier&apos;s henchmen. The visitors, the diplomats, and their local connections are embroiled in Haitian political conflicts and dangerous encounters with Duvalier&apos;s thugs, the dreaded Tonton Macoute.\n\nGreene&apos;s script is literate, and the performances are effective. The bevy of international stars is enhanced and ably supported by such pros as Paul Ford, Cicely Tyson, Raymond St. Jacques, Roscoe Lee Browne, and George Stanford Brown. Although short on action, &quot;The Comedians&quot; is long on suspense and tension. While the film certainly remains a staple for fans of Taylor and Burton, Glenville&apos;s fine production deserves to be seen and appreciated, not only for its lustrous stars, but also for throwing a spotlight on Haiti&apos;s nightmarish past.",

It&apos;s certainly unevenly acted, (a miscast Laurence Harvey is terrible and perhaps surprisingly Jane Fonda isn&apos;t much better but Barbara Stanwyck is terrific as a very butch lesbian madame and Capucine is surprisingly good as the object of both Harvey and Stanwyck&apos;s affection), and naturally it fudges the central issues of prostitution and lesbianism but it&apos;s very well shot by Joe MacDonald, beautifully designed and the screenplay by John Fante and Edmund Morris does manage to keep some of Algren&apos;s original poetry. Dmytryk was always a better director than critics gave him credit for and if he was often constrained by the studio system he was no slouch either. If this isn&apos;t the best film he ever made it still has much to recommend it.",

Haven&apos;t laughed this much and so unexpectedly since Rodney Dangerfield&apos;s antics in &apos;Back to School&apos;.  The sight gags were dead on, the whole premise of the loser worshippers of N. Diamond was hysterical and milked to perfection, and the send-up of misogyny was perfectly done. Actually, these three hapless fools were just perfectly pathetic and loveable in their own ways.  The acting was wonderful....Amanda Peet was wickedly funny, and all three male stars were equally crass and deliciously low-down. Jack Black as usual was unnervingly disgusting and real. Neal Diamond was a wonderful parody of himself, without being condescending...he fit the spirit of the movie to a &apos;T&apos;. The ending was great, reminiscent of the &apos;feel good&apos; ending of &apos;Back to School&apos;. Whenever I feel blue, I watch this movie and just can&apos;t help laughing. Maybe it just wasn&apos;t British humor (referring to the previous review), but this is FUNNY stuff."

      "reviewBody": "The stage curtains open ...\n\nBack in 1991, this movie was &quot;cool&quot;. Now, 30 years later, it is (at best) a guilty pleasure. Despite the fact that is hasn&apos;t aged that well, it does hold a measure of sentimental value to me, and even by today&apos;s standards, I still enjoy watching this from time to time. &quot;Eve Of Destruction&quot; follows a formula that was popular at the time, when an android named EVE, armed and dangerous, becomes unstable and at large.\n\nEVE is an experiment in military A.I., a female android that was created to look just like her creator, a scientist named Eve Simmons (both roles played by Renée Soutendijk). When EVE is sent into the public population for a test run, her systems become compromised during a bank robbery attempt, and soon she is at large, a danger to anyone who has the misfortune of crossing paths with her. Colonel McQuade (Greogry Hines), an expert in anti-terrorism, is sent in to neutralize the threat. But when she goes nuclear, the clock starts ticking. Together, he and the good doctor track down EVE, leading up to an explosive ending.\n\nI&apos;m of the generation that got to actually see this when it was brand new in the theaters. My wife and I went to watch it, and we both enjoyed it. It was mindless fun with decent action scenes and a few memorable moments. Hines does his best badass imitation finding a new measure of fame in the cinema after the successful films, &quot;White Nights&quot; and &quot;Running Scared&quot;. Renée Soutendijk was new to me, though she has been in numerous films before this, and several more after. But, she played her role adequately.\n\nI would recommend this to the action goer who doesn&apos;t take their movie viewing too seriously, who can appreciate a little cheese once in a while. This is definitely a guilty pleasure, but still an entertaining 100 minutes and worth the effort. I give it a solid 7 stars out of 10 without hesitation.",

It is an outstanding story about two twin brothers, one of them evil and the other benevolent, who grow up surrounded by a curse that says the older brother will die at the hands of the younger brother in the mysterious Black Room.  Karloff plays both brothers and he is excellent, quipping evil commands and leering as the malevolent sibling and prancing and being overly solicitous as the good brother.  Karloff breathes life in every pore of this film.  He is the focal point of attention as he speaks each line.  Few of his performances show so much of his range and few show him as such a twisted, ruthless individual.  This is a must see for the Karloff fan, or any fan of good old-fashioned horror stories."

      "reviewBody": "The Edge of Heaven\n\nThis is such a powerful, expansive, yet intimate movie about one of the things that matters most in our times, it&apos;s hard to fault it. The acting, the events, the setting, and implications of all these characters meeting and not quite meeting, suck you in. If it seems to have a lull now and then, you end up feeling the pace of their lives, and the pace of life itself. The events, even when they have a comic twist, are so heady and difficult they could make whole films each by themselves, but here they work through several related sections within a single tapestry. \n\nAs strong as the acting is, the core of the movie is the series of events, the plot. You&apos;ll see early on some coincidences beyond reason, making the plot almost Shakespearean, and therefore artful. The roles are each character are just a little surprising, just enough to keep us curious, yet each character represents a distinctive aspect of the crosscurrents of German and Turkish cultures and worlds, such as old people assimilating and young people refusing to assimilate. Even more than the mixing of Mexican and American worlds here in the U.S., this is a dramatic and more contentious melding, fraught with all those dangers of misunderstanding we hear in the news every day. Yet when it&apos;s brought down to the level of individuals, even seemingly unyielding ones, humanity wins.\n\nI don&apos;t know how this film will carry itself in a couple decades. As well made as it is, it feels rooted in the moment, and when the times change yet again, there might be some kind of art or magic or transcendence missing to make it fully transport a viewer. It will remain interesting, but possibly less moving. But then, maybe the themes, of parents and children, of friends looking for who they miss and avoiding who they can&apos;t stand any more, might just be universal. But as a reflection of our world right now, 2009 (or 2007, when the movie was finished), it helped clarify just what life is like out there, beyond cinematic glitter and glam, beyond hyped up violence and romance. And beyond even the limitations of documentary in creating aura.\n\nThe Edge of Heaven happens to end with such lyrical highs, the name of the movie hits you hard. We are reminded of what exists beyond all the trappings that made so many people in the previous two hours so miserable, and it&apos;s there for us to tap into and to have in common, regardless.",

      "reviewBody": "Imelda Staunton is superb and is my bet for the Oscar unless some Hollywood Diva does another &quot;out of character&quot; performance. But she only shines because of the company she keeps.This is ensemble acting at it&apos;s finest. No melodramatics, no attempt to steal scenes,and the result is as honest as life itself. This is the way the British talked, almost always indirectly, hedging around issues rather than hitting them head on, and a slave to mannered behavior. Understate, understate, understate.\n\nHaving lived in England from 1952 to 1959, and having married someone who was British who grew up during the war and it&apos;s aftermath this movie was like &quot;a bit of old home.&quot; My mother employed &quot;char ladies&quot; like Vera, although we were &quot;upper middle class&quot; rather than &quot;upper.&quot; The class differences were quite distinct in those days, and often determined by accent. What this movie shows is not only the average life of a &quot;lower class&quot; family but the options forced on them that were different from those in the higher brackets of society.\n\nAs anyone should know by know the movie is about illegal abortion in a rigid\n\npuritanical society. Illegal, that is, for those without means, but quite available to those who could grease the wheels of the medical establishment who had &quot;legal&quot; ways around the law. In other words if Roe v. Wade goes then Vera&apos;s will pop up again. \n\nThere is no attempt to make a statement for or against abortion. As Mike Leigh has said: abortion has been in every society for thousands of years. The Vera Drake&apos;s who have lived could populate a small city. What this movie does do is emphasize that the Vera&apos;s were/are common average people not quasi criminals lurking behind the curtains of some seedy back alley shack, and that legislating morality never addresses the often harsh reality of human society.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, an &apos;Eraserhead&apos; for children. This film has some of the most gorgeous imagery in an animated film that I&apos;ve seen. I don&apos;t remember too much of &quot;Alice in the Wonderland&quot; from the Disney version that I&apos;ve seen a couple years ago, but I&apos;ve got a hunch it didn&apos;t involve a girl crawling through a drawer after a rabbit with clicking gopher teeth and a limited diet of sawdust that he has a problem containing in his body, only for her to be left in a room that she fills with her own tears while a small rat has a cookout on her head. &quot;Alice&quot; is a re-telling of the popular children&apos;s tale, but it&apos;s a vivid and imaginative version that has the ability to disturb to the very same effect of the David Lynch film. The stop-motion animation enhances the creepiness of the film where familiar characters are given a Gothic and dark makeover. The story takes place in an old fashioned setting; the walls faded with age and abandonment. I loved the setting of this odd little tale and its very morbid idea of a &quot;wonderland&quot; and its characters including a frog with a very realistic tongue, a &quot;catapiller&quot; that we wouldn&apos;t normally think of such, and a moving wad of meat. The resulting film is a stunning achievement. My only somewhat minor qualm, the narration of the main character Alice&apos;s lips popping up repetitively throughout the film really started to get grating in the first couple of minutes. However, completely random and unpredictable, &quot;Alice&quot; moves at a somewhat slow pace but develops a level of coherency in the midst of all its strange happenings. The sounds, all though a bit loud, give so much life to the smallest objects. The film effectively evokes the emotions of the human psych that a surrealist film should aim for. And, in the context of a celebrated children&apos;s story, it elevates its effect with jarring imagery and sound that make it memorable and an important film in the history of animated film.",

      "reviewBody": "Ray Owens used to be part of an elite LAPD anti-narcotics task force but now he is enjoying a quieter life as a small Arizona town on the Mexican border. His peace and quiet is about to be shattered... drug lord Gabriel Cortez is being moved by the FBI but following a dramatic escape he flees south in a stolen 200MPH supercar and an FBI agent hostage. As he heads south his heavily armed associates set about placing a mobile assault bridge over the narrow canyon near Sheriff Owens&apos;s town. They kill the landowner causing somebody who misses him to contact Owens. An investigation leads to a confrontation that leaves one deputy dead. As Cortez heads to the border Owen and his surviving deputies get ready for his arrival; before that though they will have to face his henchmen in a showdown on Main Street.\n\nThis action film is a lot of fun; it starts well with the spectacular escape. It then turns into an effective western as the small town sheriff and his small number of deputies prepare for the arrival of a superior force of bad guys while they know help will not arrive in time. Arnold Schwarzenegger shows that he still has what it takes to play the lead role in an action film. The supporting cast, which includes some familiar faces is also solid enough. South Korean director Kim Jee-Woon, best known for &apos;Oriental western&apos; &apos;The Good, The Bad, The Weird&apos; once again combines action, some of which is quite bloody, with an enjoyable degree of humour without tipping it into being a comedy. The action is nicely varied with car chases, smashing through road blocks, fights and shootouts... one of which involves Arnie using a Vickers machinegun! Overall I&apos;d say that this is an enjoyably action film full of western tropes; it might not be a must-see but it is still worth watching if you are a fan of the genre.",

He could almost taste the sweetness of a well balanced life - the honey at home the white picket fence the dog running around in the yard, but circumstance (his likings for the female of the species, penchant for stealing cars and his friendship with good &apos;ol HARRY [played brilliantly by KEANU REEVES]), just got in the way of true happiness.\n\nThe supporting cast give good all round performances, especially  Claire Forlani as the girl of Cassidy&apos;s &apos;dreams&apos;.\n\nThis movie catches the &apos;beat&apos; excellently with great visuals and a Class A soundtrack.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Years later, he returns under the name Vater Jaguar to finally catch the bad guy and avoid a new war between the South American natives and the government troops. The great cast includes Karl May regular Rik Battaglia, Fernando Rey and no less than 3 comedians: Walter Giller, Heinz Erhardt and (in a rather limited role that doesn&apos;t allow him to show his qualities) Chris Howland.\n\nAlthough the movie had a lot of effort put into it, including filming in the real Machu Picchu (Peru), its success never got near the previous Karl May movies of the 1960s which were placed in North America. The audience missed stars like Lex Barker and Pierre Brice, and the Italian western style soundtrack by A F Lavagnino sounds titally different from Martin Böttcher&apos;s music for the other Karl May movies, so the whole feeling was wrong. It didn&apos;t help that the story was a bit lame, while the comedians didn&apos;t have a real connection to it - it feels like they were cut in from a different movie. Although the movie was quite a disaster in commercial terms, it is interesting to see a different approach to the famous Karl May novels.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Il Fiore delle mille e una notte&apos;, or &apos;Arabian Nights&apos;, is Pier Paolo Pasolini&apos;s final film from his &quot;trilogy of life&quot; and his second to last film in general. His last of course is &apos;Salo, or 120 Days of Sodom&apos;, the controversial first film from his &quot;trilogy of death&quot;.\n\nWith &apos;Arabian Nights&apos; Pasolini combines a couple of stories from the book &apos;A Thousand and One Nights&apos; into one story, although the film itself still feels very episodic. All parts of the story deal with love, or actually I should say lust, ending in sex. Especially the penis gets enough screen time here, it might as well be the leading character. The sex scenes themselves are, in my opinion, not very sensual or erotic (although they admittedly are when you compare them to such scenes in any other Pasolini film) which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it becomes exactly that when more than half the movie exists out of them.\n\nOn the other hand the film is pretty entertaining, mostly for its oddness. That again, is something we see in almost any other Pasolini film. His distant approach adds to that feeling, especially when he shows violent images. One might not expect them in a film that arguably celebrates love and sex. Another factor for the oddness is the terrible acting, especially from the men. Maybe good acting is impossible for them here since Pasolini presents them as a bunch of whiners who would do anything for love. Of course, once again, with love I mean sex. The Italian language in the Eastern setting is another thing that feels pretty weird as well. All these elements add to the oddness which makes the film more entertaining than it probably should have been.\n\nI have to conclude with saying that I sort of admire Pasolini. I think only his &apos;Il vangelo secundo Matteo&apos; can be considered as a truly great film, mostly since his approach is the distant one. I think that is a good thing when it comes to a religious film like that. that approach in his other films is not always the right one, but it is one aspect of why his films are different, often daring. Even when not much is happening, or when we have no clue what is happening, or when we normally would not care that much, Pasolini keeps it kind of interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "Like its subject, this movie is interesting and generally entertaining, but often overblown.  It&apos;s well worth seeing, although it could also have been whittled down by a good portion of its running time without losing anything important.  It does present a believable and entertaining look at Ziegfeld&apos;s shows and personality, along with some good scenes and some good performances that keep it going.\n\nWilliam Powell was a pretty good choice to play Ziegfeld, since he has the knack of making a character eccentric and distinctive without having it come across as too forced or unnatural.  And Myrna Loy is always a charming co-star, for Powell or anyone else.  Yet it is Luise Rainer who delivers by far the most memorable performance - she makes her character temperamental but endearing, unpredictable but completely sympathetic.  The best parts of the movie come when she is a big part of the action, and when her character slips into the background in the second half, the movie loses something. The rest of the large cast does get some good moments, and it&apos;s fun to see a couple of performers playing themselves, although some of them don&apos;t get nearly enough to do.  The many production numbers contain some very good ones, but there are others that aren&apos;t worth the amount of time they were given, and that could have been cut down considerably without losing anything.\n\nYou can see why this impressed a lot of viewers in its time, and it&apos;s still pretty good entertainment.  It could have been better, though, with a little more restraint.  But then, its excesses are rather in keeping with its subject, and at any rate they don&apos;t keep it from being worth seeing."

      "reviewBody": "Poor David (Dylan Provencher). His parents have died in a car accident in the States. With no other choice, he is sent to live with his only known relative, his grandfather Adam (James Cromwell) on the Isle of Man. Before David lands on the beautiful island in the Irish Sea, his grandfather has to be persuaded by the social services to let the boy stay with him, as Adam is a bitter, crusty recluse. However, things initially go well. Perhaps it is because David volunteers to help with the work almost the minute he arrives. This involves taking care of the farm, especially the herd of sheep. Yet, as David soon discovers, there is a sheepdog as testy as Adam, named Zack, who minds the sheep. One day, David makes the acquaintance of near neighbors, Maggie and her father Michael, but as soon as Adam finds out, he tells David not to see them again. There is, you see, a long-standing grievance between Adam and Michael. In addition, they are rivals in the island&apos;s annual sheepdog contest, where Maggie&apos;s dog Owd Bob is second only to Zack. David and Maggie continue to see each other on the sly. Soon, a crisis occurs. There are lambs turning up dead on the hills and the suspected killer is Zack, Adam&apos;s dog, though he vehemently denies it. Also, sadness arrives at Maggie&apos;s house and Zack wants to help but is forbidden. What will happen to all of the folks on this little speck of gorgeous land? This is a fine tale with a breathtaking setting which few will get to visit. The Isle of Man sits in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland and it will put your eye out with its beauty. Meanwhile, this is really a story of two dogs, Bob and Zack, and the quarreling families who own them. There is much screen time devoted to the problems of the humans, too. Cromwell is an exceptional actor and he repeats the farmer&apos;s role he had in Babe, only with no seeming warmth in his heart. Provencher, Colm Meany and all of the other cast members are quite fine, too. Be forewarned that tears are likely to gush forth at any viewing. But, for certain, get this film now, before you are OWD! Its wonderful.",

If the film had been seen when it was shot,in 1970,with the Viet Nam war still raging,the use as host of the aging John Wayne,associated at the time with The Green Berets film and criticism of peace demonstrators,might have come off as offensive.We should focus instead on the tightly put together look back at Chesty Puller,s career,using footage from 1920s Haiti and Nicaragua involvements,Guadalcanal and New Guinea in WWII,and finally Korea; the elegiac use of blurry dissolves and superimpositions to weave the present of Puller,s participation in brightly colored parades in his honor with images of the past as he remembers them.",

      "name": "A well-made and important counterpoint to the canon of &apos;Vietnam films&apos;",
      "reviewBody": "A Japanese photographer returns to Vietnam three years after documenting its &apos;liberation&apos; and becomes increasingly involved in the fate of a young girl and her family. It is a time of poverty, violence and death.\n\nThere are many deaths in this film and the majority of these deaths are graphically depicted. One of the least explicit, but perhaps the most moving, occurs on a scrap heap surrounded by a body of filthy water. While the young victim&apos;s blood is still flowing out, his peer runs the length of the heap bearing a standard, his identity and the colours of the flag rendered anonymous by the remote camera angle and the silhouette produced by the setting sun. The boy lays the flag over the body with a timeliness and purpose that implies he is always ready for such tragedies. It is one of the film&apos;s most striking images, calling to mind such questionable iconic images as the flag-raisers of Iwo Jima.\n\nSuch readings are possible over much of the film. Director Ann Hui&apos;s &apos;vérité&apos; camera calls to mind Altman&apos;s M*A*S*H, as does her treatment of violence and its bloody consequences - something which contrasts with the comic book violence of later 80s Hong Kong films (with which many people are more familiar). Comparisons could also be made with Kubrick&apos;s use of zoom (though M*A*S*H has this too) and formal composition, with characters placed in the centre of frame as if being interviewed for live television. Kubrick, of course, would later direct his own Vietnam masterpiece, Full Metal Jacket.\n\nComparisons could even be made with Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s Apocalypse Now. Coppola&apos;s helicopter sequence filmed in the Philippines shares a lot with Hui&apos;s remarkable opening shot of tanks driving through the streets of Hainan, China (both standing in for Vietnam). However, where Coppola tended towards using the imagery of Vietnam to attain a greater artistic goal, Hui would be discredited for receiving any such reading. Where the sound of Coppola&apos;s napalm explosions bring a certain excitement and satisfaction to the viewer, the gunshots heralding executions and the chance for children to pillage the corpses has an entirely different motive and effect.\n\nOne of the film&apos;s strengths is that, while it plays with, even exploits some well-established grammars of film making - tragedy, documentary, romance - it never defers to a single one. The film works on each level equally well. It is a well-told story: excellently paced and genuinely compelling right up to the end credits. At the other end of the spectrum, it is perhaps the boldest and most unflinching criticism of the brutality and hypocrisy of communist states to come out of a small island that would, 17 years later, become a Special Administrative Region of such a state.\n\nThe film has elements of curiosity. One can accept for purely practical reasons the need for Cantonese to be the common language of Vietnamese and Japanese characters. It is harder to understand why a Japanese man (played by a local Hong Kong actor) should be the main protagonist, especially considering the film&apos;s political overtones. Does he represent objectiveness or irony? Perhaps there is no single answer.\n\nDespite some minor flaws, the film manages to illustrate without preaching, condescending or even aestheticising the subject, even though the dimly-lit tableaux and pitch-perfect editing combine very pleasingly for the eye. Hui works with a lightness of touch rarely seen in Hong Kong or Hollywood at that time or since and with a feminist subtext scarcely seen in her later work. This film well-deserves the acclaim with which it was awarded on its release and is sadly underrated at the time of writing. It serves as an interesting and important counterpoint to the various lavish &apos;magnum opuses&apos; of American directors of that era and has an enduring relevance and importance that many young people, especially of the film&apos;s native land, would benefit from experiencing.",

Whoopi Goldberg plays the quirky and livewire Terri Doolitle a low level bank employee who gets involved in a dangerous spy game involving the CIA, British Secret Service and the KGB (made in the 80&apos;s the cold war was still in full swing).\n\nContacted via her computer (the computer geeks out there will love seeing this earlier version of the internet) by a secret agent codename &apos;Jumping Jack Flash&apos; (Jonathan Pryce) Terri must use her street smarts and attitude to save the day against rogue agents, KGB the police and while not being fired from her own job.\n\nThe only drawback to this movie is it is quite profane those adverse to the occasional swear word should probably steer clear. It&apos;s similar in the level of language used to Beverley Hills Cop, so probably not one for the small kids. But fun for everyone else.\n\n7/10 - Good honest fun probably Whoopi Goldbergs funniest movie and certainly no Sister Act thank god!!!",

      "reviewBody": "The two stars of the movie Moon Child Gackt (ex Malice Mizer, solo artist) and Hyde (L&apos;arc en Ciel, solo artist) are both rock idols in Japan, so it goes without saying that my expectations were fairly low for this film heading in.\n\nThe plot is quite a piece of work. On one level it&apos;s a typical gangster picture about orphans growing up in the slums and trying to carve out a piece of the pie for themselves. And on another level it&apos;s about the transience of life and the value of happiness, which is shown to us through the presence of the vampire Kei (Hyde), who is forever trapped in his youth. Yes, there&apos;s a vampire. But the story isn&apos;t actually about the vampire, it&apos;s about Sho (Gackt).\n\nThe movie opens with Sho, his brother Shinji and Toshi as children innocently robbing a local gangster. In the midst of the retreat Sho comes upon Kei, who is burning in the sunlight, Sho takes Kei to their hideout and before you know it Kei&apos;s true nature is revealed. Flash forward a few years and we see a young Sho on the verge of manhood, and Kei, still unchanged but smiling a lot more.\n\nThe movie has the traditional three acts of a gangster picture. Predictably the first act has a happy go lucky quality to it, but all the while the director shows you glimpses of the dark clouds looming beyond. Act two is the fake smile on the frown, and Act three is the tears and redemption. As far as pacing and writing goes, I think the movie does a top notch job of trusting its character&apos;s motivations and histories. I was genuinely moved by the story.\n\nThe problem isn&apos;t with the script, the problem is with the action. The action scenes though some are creative and funny, are monotonous and unbelievable. For all the drama in the comedy/drama scenes there is very little in the action scenes. Which are so full of gun shots you&apos;re likely to get a headache. Sho walking into machine gun fire is so ridiculous it makes Rambo look plausible.\n\nI also had a few qualms about the performances, especially Hyde&apos;s Kei. While he was good as the stranger standing aloof, or the morbid figure smiling dully, he failed to convince me of his &apos;curse&apos;, and he failed to step up when it came time to be dramatic. This was his inexperience as an actor showing.\n\nOverall I think the story is such a good one that I&apos;m willing to forgive most of the film&apos;s shortcomings. It may not be the prettiest film, but it definitely has some great shots, and great moments. You won&apos;t see another movie where the vampire is a secondary character this year or possibly any other. Moon Child is a unique experience and though it takes some getting used to, when all is said and done, you&apos;ll be glad you invested time and emotion in these characters."

      "reviewBody": "In 1982 ITC New York Offices decided to edit together 4 episodes of Space: 1999 to create 2 more Gerry Anderson movies to rap up their &apos;Super Space Theatre&apos; series which would be broadcast on American television. This was their first Space: 1999 movie made by editing together two episodes of Space: 1999 from Season 2 &apos;Metamorph&apos; and &apos;Space Warp&apos;. 5 minutes was cut from each episode to bring the total length to 95 minutes (the maximum for a 2 hour television slot on American television). In addition annoying video animated opening and ending titles were added and music from the first series of Space: 1999 which is a contrast to the Season 2 music. They even added music from two other Gerry Anderson series &apos;Joe 90&apos; and &apos;UFO&apos;.For some reason the producer&apos;s also decided to change the dialogue of the Grasshopper alien in the &apos;Space Warp&apos; section, in favour of an irritating Star Wars joke, as the Grasshopper is now called &apos;Vader, Commander of the Wileys Interplanetary Star Fleet&apos;. Having said this the episodes do blend together well and the added music isn&apos;t too bad, even if sometimes it overlap&apos;s with the original soundtrack! It does however deserve some amount of respect, because it was one of the first glimpses British fans had of the series on video in the mid 80&apos;s when Channel 5 video released it. Anyone who likes Space: 1999 should enjoy this movie, but it is not always faithful to the original material and the ITC London made &apos;Destination Moonbase Alpha&apos; and &apos;Alien Attack&apos; are much more faithful to the show.",

In Green Tea, she plays two characters with opposite personalities. One is an introvert and the other an extrovert. She is quite believable in how she portrays each.

I saw the movie last night in a packed theater. Big Willie Weekend has returned, and for good reason! It&apos;s a great movie to see during the holidays and definitely a tear-jerker! Perfect for a date, a night out with friends, or even with family. If you ever thought Will Smith really couldn&apos;t act (and shame on you!), you&apos;ll think otherwise once you see this movie. You can really feel what he&apos;s going through just by looking in his eyes. And Jaden Smith is too adorable! Their on screen chemistry is almost unbearable to watch! Go see this movie! Great acting, great directing, great writing...you won&apos;t regret it!",

It comes, however, with excellent modern drawing, natural 3D art and animation to add to a distinct story of friends &amp; sharing.\n\nAt the base of this is a great, very simple to understand story for kids. Treasure your friends and share with them. It&apos;s more complex than that, involving theft both direct and indirect, and some devious political-like characters for adults to enjoy.\n\nThe humor in the film alternates from kiddy and tween to puns and some more amusing adult idiosyncrasies and allusions. The soundtrack is extremely limited but works in the few places it&apos;s used.",

Here&apos;s a story where there is no life-or-death conflict, no raging anger, no violent outbursts.  Nothing blowed up real good, and there is nothing resembling a chase scene.  The conflict is about the ways in which people can be nice to each other.  Their personal differences of passion or conviction are not as important as the ways in which they can connect with each other.\n\nHow shockingly refreshing.\n\nThere is an undercurrent to this film that gives it the feel of a Garrison Keillor monologue, in that it is built around people&apos;s personal foibles and quirks.\n\nEven more refreshing is how &quot;Babette&apos;s Feast&quot; manages to be nice without becoming cloying, saccharine, facile, superficial or insincere.  People&apos;s personal passions are portrayed not only from their own perspective, but from the perspective of the people they affect, with more realism than you usually get in film, yet also with sincere and infectious optimism.\n\nIf you don&apos;t come away from &quot;Babette&apos;s Feast&quot; smiling and feeling better, then you must have been distracted from giving it your full attention. This is one of those very rare films that you can recommend to everyone you know. It is truly in a class by itself.  Like Mary Poppins, &quot;Practically perfect in every way.&quot;\n\nUtterly charming and subtly stunning."

The movie is disjointed, confusing to the point of disbelief and too damn predictable. The only difference between this and Terminator is at least this won&apos;t be back. The characters are week, the story unoriginal and the soundtrack uninspiring. If this is what the future looks like then maybe we should all just upload ourselves into Facebook and befriend everyone there. Kevin Corrigan should stick to movies/TV series where the unbelievable or sci-fi is just that - UNBELIEVABLE.",

Apart from this, it is really a unique trait - with very macabre and sometimes outright silly humor. Director Rainer Matsutani is better known for the one episode he did for the original Lexx series (the movie series, not the TV series that followed) and his taste for the fantastic and bizarre clearly shows in this black comedy, too. Fred is such a disgusting character that one is almost tempted to genuinely like him, as is his horrible wife Charlotte. If you&apos;re looking for an unusual German production, give this one a try (unless you&apos;re afraid of turkeys, of course...)",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Firemen&apos;s Ball&apos; (the Czech title is &apos;Horí, má panenko&apos; - &apos;Fire, my doll!&apos;), the last film made in Czechoslovakia by Milos Forman in 1967, before the &apos;spring of Prague&apos; and the exile that moved his career to the West, is in my opinion not only his best film and the best film of the talented and courageous Czechoslovak film schools of the 1960s, but also, allegedly, the best film made in the communist countries behind of the Iron Curtain. It is a symbolic film, a precious jewel that in only 70 minutes concentrates sarcasm and the absurd, social and political criticism on the edge of the permissible under the conditions of censorship, and the refusal of the film mekers to be reduced to silence.\n\nSomewhere in the socialist Czechoslovakia, the firemen committee organizes a ball in honor of the 86th birthday of their former chief. Birthday 85th had been omitted, and in the meantime the veteran of the guild has been detected with cancer, though he doesn&apos;t know it. The celebration is being prepared according to all the rules of this kind of activity, with a raffle from which the objects are stolen, first the ones of value and the consumables, then the smaller ones, finally everything disappears. A beauty contest is organized in which the young women are judged by their physical qualities, being are enlisted some on the basis of relationships, some on the basis of misogynistic criteria. Formalism and propaganda language, inefficiency and ineptitude of bureaucratic systems meet in a comedy of the absurd. Some of the satirized failures are systemic, others belong to human nature and its eternal morals and weaknesses. In one form or another the script of this film could have been written by Moliere or by Ionesco.\n\nForman&apos;s film is a concentrate of sarcastic satire. Each of the characters has his or her role in the story and his or her distinct personality, even if present on the screen for only a few seconds. The pace is marked by the choreography of the movement of the characters in the dance scenes in sync with the movements of the camera and by the soundtrack, in which the ball orchestra plays loud music. Laughter sometimes turns into a shout of pain, and the two final scenes are symbolic and at the same time of an irresistible black comic. Comedy of morals meets political cinema in this unique film. Seen today from a historical perspective, it can be said that &apos;The Firemen&apos;s Ball&apos; describes all the reasons (bureaucracy, propaganda, corruption) that have led to the collapse of the structure of the communist states but is also a reflection upon human nature that transcends political systems and upheavals.",

We get to see several cyclops, a dragon, a giant roc, a baby roc, a snake woman and, best of all, a skeleton.  \n\nThe movie&apos;s cast includes Kerwin Mathews as Sinbad and Torin Thatcher as the mad magician, Sokurah.  These play great parts, as does Richard Eyer as the Genie.  The theme music and score by Bernard Herrmann is magnificent.  The movie was directed by Nathan Juran (The Deadly Mantis).\n\nThis is the best of Harryhausen&apos;s Sinbad movies and one of his best movies overall, along with Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen this, you are missing out.  Fantastic.\n\nRating: 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Reptile&quot; is a competently produced and watchable horror entry from Hammer productions but offers little new to the genre. Once again we have new-comers to a district that harbours a deadly secret, who must deal with hostile locals before getting get sucked into events, while ominous music and the classic &apos;moors&apos; setting establishes tone. The generic characters don&apos;t present much of a challenge to the actors (exceptions being John Laurie, whose Mad Peter manages to avoid the usual town-drunk shtick and Jacqueline Pearce, who is very good as the mysterious girl). Sadly, while the movie effectively builds to a climax, the final scenes are marred by the appearance of the titular creature and its sudden anticlimactic death. A fair amount of suspension of belief is required (especially to the &apos;basement&apos; of the Franklyn home) and there are some plot-driven inconsistencies (e.g. venom works a lot faster on secondary characters than on primary characters), but otherwise, &apos;The Reptile&apos; is a pretty good example of mid-sixties British horror (other than the absence of Hammer perennials Cushing and Lee).",

The acting is done really well by the few characters that we see, they seem immersed in the situation, filled with as much emotion as you would expect. The second half of the movie will have you debating with others and yourself on what stance you would take.

      "reviewBody": "I haven&apos;t seen the new remake of this movie yet, but they have some pretty big shoes to fill. Technically Ocean&apos;s Eleven may not be a great film, but whatever minor plot shortcomings that exist are made up for in spades by immeasurable style.\n\nI&apos;m not going to explain the plot, as I&apos;m sure that 50 other people already have. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve watched an older movie, so I found the loose-yet-confident chemistry and acting of the brat pack members to be very refreshing. They seemed so natural around each other, which is no surprise considering that they were buddies in real life. Sammy Davis Jr. was his usual charismatic self (why didn&apos;t he take off with the money??), Dean Martin seemed to be playing himself, a bit tipsy and sweaty with a drink in one hand and a smoke in the other, as he does in most of his films, and Frank Sinatra was also good as the understated womanizing organizer. However, I thought that Cesar Romero (known for his manic portayal of the Joker in the 60&apos;s Batman tv series) really stole the show right out from under the overly confident brat pack...I found his performance to be very commanding and impressive. A nice surprise to see comedian Red Skelton and Norm Fell (Three&apos;s Company&apos;s Mr. Roper!) in there as well!\n\nA few things hilariously go unexplained, like how they all managed to get casino jobs virtually overnnight, but it hardly seemed to matter. You know this movie is basically just a vehicle for the brat pack, and it&apos;s pure entertainment to just watch all these legends hamming it up, especially during the couple of musical interludes where you get to hear Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. croon a few really catchy songs, like E-O Eleven!\n\nAt the same time it&apos;s also a window into another era, a time of larger than life Hollywood stars. Another thing that really jumped out at me was how unabashedly politically incorrect this movie is, showcasing a dramatically different mentality than what we see in movies today. Ocean&apos;s Eleven is a pure guy flick, where all the women are no more than window dressing and are treated as such by the male characters. As dated as the macho attitude of the film may seem nowadays (and even already by late 60&apos;s standards), I found it to be a fascinating glimpse into the past when guys were guys and women were umm, dames! As ironic as it is, I found seeing this old movie without the typical modern day contrived politically correct preaching to be very refreshing, and somehow strangely rebellious!",

And I will admit, I have never seen anything quite like &quot;Gutterballs&quot;. A comedic slasher film at heart, the 1970&apos;s exploitation homage oozes out of every frame in bold (Red) colors. But, besides the gore, you are watching what most Cinemax late night adult movies will not even show... You see it all!!! This might be there for a reason though, to cover up the fact that there really is NO story, or at least nothing the average 25 year old could find interesting. Never really introducing the characters, the writing just seems to be that of an over-sexed 15 year old boy, filled with horror movie cliché&apos;s, boobs and explicit language. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but when the dialog becomes nothing more then F-Bombs, followed by more F-Bombs, then a couple of &quot;Where&apos;s my whores?&quot;, followed by (you guessed it) another F-Bomb, it gets old real fast... Really bad acting is compensated by tons of graphic gore. In fact, the gore-factor (Almost) out-weighs the porn-factor, but alas we are so stunned by some of the nudity that the gratuitous splatter is almost over-looked. I am NOT knocking this film! In fact, I found it extremely fun and a great way to bring back some great old ideas and try a few new ones. Mr. Nicholson obviously has a talent for knowing what entertains (at least 15 year old boys), and I think with a bit more (creative) writing and character development, he will become a horror force to be reckoned with.",

I&apos;m now thinking that the people that make these movies are the ones giving it the star rating.\n\nIt&apos;s really not a great show. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not like it&apos;s the worst show ever but it&apos;s your standard psychological thriller without any thrills at all. \n\nThe actors did a good job, the set itself is OK - it&apos;s the story that really sucks. It&apos;s also pretty derivative and you can probably guess the ending shortly after it starts...\n\nWhat I really disliked was that almost all of the characters were truly rotten people. The kind you certainly wouldn&apos;t want to be in a bunker with. \n\nI kept waiting for some kind of ending to make it all worthwhile, some redeeming feature - but none was to be had. \n\nIn the end, I started fast-forwarding to get to the end. I personally think the other reviews on this show have a vested interest. Fake news in other words.",

Is an Italian crime/horror movie that follows a group of characters trying to catch a serial killer who&apos;s targeting teenage girls. It&apos;s the kind of premise that&apos;s been done to death, but it&apos;s the way it&apos;s done here that&apos;s interesting. It&apos;s fast-paced, surprisingly well-shot, memorably bloody, and also features some great music. In fact, it&apos;s the music that cancels out the bad dubbing, really, because while most Italian movies from this time don&apos;t have very good dubbing, this one kind of goes one step beyond, because it&apos;s really bad at points.\n\nI can see these crime/horror/thriller movies from Italy in the 1970s being the next genre I hyper-fixate on, as I&apos;ve done with kaiju movies, samurai movies, and martial arts movies. There&apos;s something really interesting about them (I&apos;d call them Giallo movies, but I&apos;m not entirely sure yet whether this particular movie counts as Giallo).\n\nSo overall, What Have They Done to Your Daughters? Isn&apos;t anything new when it comes to its story or characters, and it&apos;s kind of sleazy in parts, but it&apos;s well-made and consistently engaging, making it a pleasant surprise to watch, because I wasn&apos;t expecting this to be of a moderately high quality.",

      "description": "HE&apos;S NO ANGEL, HE&apos;S JUST A BIKER FROM HELL!\r\nThe naked body of a schoolgirl leads the police to a teenage prostitution ring as vice and corruption explode onto the Italian streets in a blaze of machete-wielding fury.\r\nWhen suspects in the case are killed by a mysterious stranger clad in motorbike leathers, the police realise that the trail of corruption goes all the way to the top, and set their sights on busting the case wide open. But as the body count rises, the crash-helmet-wearing motor-psycho colours the mean streets red in a bid to stop them.\r\n\r\nMassimo Dallamano&apos;s masterful hybrid of giallo mystery and poliziotteschi thriller is interwoven with breakneck chase-sequences and a deeply cool soundtrack to create a landmark in 70s European cinema.\r\n\r\nWhat Have They Done To Your Daughters? (cert. 18) is released uncut (for the first time in the UK) on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment. The film will be presented remastered in 1.85:1 with English 2.0 sound.

The robot has a conscience (and a dopey cartoon voice) and enjoys escaping from its desert model airplane hangar to  fly around the countryside (cue for massive amounts of stock footage). A movie that was made during an extended period in which director Ulli Lommel used lots of stock footage in his other movies, like Wardbirds and The Big Sweat. The teens race from their homes to the hangar and then back home, back to the hangar, fake out a bored security guard at the hangar, get in the hangar, have lengthy conversations with the robot, race home, hangar, home, hangar... You get the idea. There&apos;s a subplot in here somewhere about kids with disinterested parents who have too much time on their hands. The film itself is for people who have too much time on their hands. Unbelievable bore, much worse than any of Lommel&apos;s other previous record holders for worst films ever made (and there are several vying for that dubious honor)."

      "reviewBody": "A mysterious young man named Ian makes his home in a small town, where he falls in love with Elisabeth, a preacher&apos;s daughter. All is well. But wait! A creepy traveling circus visits town, and its leader Harper has some shady business going on. There seems to be a connection between Ian and Harper - a connection that threatens to cause turmoil in the peaceful town. \n\nThe never-ending Howling series is back, this time with Part VI: &quot;The Freaks&quot;. Like its precursor &quot;Howling V&quot;, this movie is alright, but nothing to write home about. The story is okay and the characters are likable enough. At least they gave them some defined features, which is a rarity in the Howling franchise. The circus atmosphere is kinda creepy and the transformation scenes are cool. The editing does a better job than the special effects, though. This wouldn&apos;t be the Howling without some blunders. I counted two boom mics hanging in the screen, maybe there are more. Classic.\n\n&quot;Howling VI&quot; doesn&apos;t have too many horror scenes: There&apos;s a nicely timed jump scare, three transformation scenes, a bloody corpse and that&apos;s basically it. This movie is more about the conflict between Ian and Harper. The script raises an interesting question: What does it mean to be a &quot;freak&quot; and a social outcast? But it doesn&apos;t provide satisfying answers. Instead, it backtracks into a generic love story. Still, it&apos;s nice that they even touched a topic like that. The acting is fairly decent this time around. Brendan Hughes as Ian is sympathetic, and Bruce Payne as the evil Harker hams it up delightfully. Michele Matheson&apos;s voice is a bit annoying, but she does a good job as the love interest Elisabeth.\n\n&quot;Howling VI&quot; made me care about the characters, which is a novelty. But this movie won&apos;t transform the Howling franchise into a prestigious horror series. A zealous plot featuring likable characters doesn&apos;t make a suspenseful horror flick, after all. The execution is as subpar as ever. It&apos;s one of the more proficient Howling movies. But that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s worthy of your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Frederick Wiseman is, of course, one of the best documentary film-makers, a wonderfully evocative but not manipulative cinema verite director who has consistently been making quality documentaries for several decades. &quot;High School&quot; is now available from Zipporah films, albeit for a higher price than many films ($35), and it is arguably his most accessible feature.\n\nWiseman has directed several films that run longer than three hours, mind-numbingly intense documentaries which fiercely tear into their subject matter and are nearly completely thematically ambiguous, but &quot;High School&quot; is more a straightforward documentary, reminiscent in places of the sort of film the Maysles Brothers made, and of &quot;Titicut Follies&quot;, perhaps the only other Wiseman film with a definitive approach to the subject matter. The film doesn&apos;t feature the sort of objectivity some of Wiseman&apos;s other films do, and even the sequel to this feature, &quot;High School II&quot;, which looked at a 90&apos;s high school, is far more ambiguous and much longer than this lean 75-minute feature, but around as good.\n\nStill, the film is not marred by simplistic messages and a preachy attitude. Wiseman&apos;s films, as they normally do, allow a remarkably candid, voyeuristic experience for the audience, letting us see some of the social attitudes of the era as well as capturing the timeless feel of the high school experience. In what is perhaps the film&apos;s greatest scene a teacher formally recites &quot;The Dangling Conversation&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel, then plays the song for the class. You see small mannerisms change, the teacher suddenly has a hopeful look in her eyes rather than one of a tired educator, and Wiseman brilliantly captures the class&apos;s reaction without the scene ever feeling contrived or forced. It&apos;s just the sort of scene that Wiseman does perfectly, asking the audience to interpret the images for themselves, never overstepping his boundaries and preaching to the audience. \n\n&quot;High School&quot; is almost certainly Wiseman&apos;s most accessible film. At 75 minutes in length it goes by quite fast and although it isn&apos;t necessarily designed as entertainment it is more or less easy to watch except for those who had traumatic high school experiences. &quot;High School II&quot; is a more complex and ambitious film (and, of course, seen by far fewer people), but &quot;High School&quot; might have the edge in terms of just how effective and lean it is. It&apos;s a perfectly-structured documentary with a stunning final scene, and may be one of my favorite films. \n\n10/10"

      "reviewBody": "High expectations can be a bad thing when it comes to viewing obscure exploitation films. The problem is, once you&apos;ve finally seen the film in question, it&apos;s like all of the past descriptions and reviews of it that made you want to see it in the first place were for a different film completely. SEEDING OF A GHOST suffers from this very syndrome. While certainly odd and unique, I have to admit that I was disappointed by this. Don&apos;t be fooled by all the hype surrounding this in cult movie circles; it&apos;s not half as outrageous as you&apos;ve probably been led to believe.\n\nThe plot is suitably contrived. A cab driver accidentally runs into a mysterious vagrant, who promptly scuttles off into the woods. Meanwhile, his wife Irene has begun an affair with a handsome married man; she asks him to marry her, he refuses, and later that night she ends up getting raped and murdered by a couple of hoodlums. The cabbie is inexplicably led to her body through supernatural means, and decides to take revenge. He goes to the aforementioned vagrant, who promptly digs up Irene&apos;s body and begins a series of black magic rituals that lead to all sorts of weird happening amongst the perps: one guy throws up worms over his dinner plate, another is tricked into eating brains, and the married man&apos;s wife is possessed. Without giving anything away, all of this eventually leads to a blood-soaked finale in which Irene sets out for a final revenge...\n\nFrom all the reviews I had read about SEEDING OF A GHOST, I had been led to believe that it was an incredibly disgusting, disturbing and downright nasty little film. Well, only a portion of that is correct. This film is not bad at all, but it&apos;s hardly notable. It reminded me of an EC comic book like TALES FROM THE CRYPT: it&apos;s incredibly over-the-top and weird, but too silly to be taken seriously. And although not as comical as, say, MR. VAMPIRE or A Chinese GHOST STORY, this still has a sense of humor, albeit a very strange one.\n\nOne thing this film is is SLEAZY; there&apos;s an undercurrent of misogyny here that will not fly with a lot of Western viewers. All of the women are essentially dumb, slutty punching bags, and the film is packed with a number of leering, gratuitous nude scenes that are so blatant in their execution they&apos;re not even erotic. The truth is, by the one hour mark I was kind of fed up; I had been given nudity galore, sex, creepy atmosphere, explosions and multiple kung fu fights (!), but what I really wanted was some horror. This film&apos;s structure is totally disjointed; it&apos;s like the filmmakers were making it up as they went along.\n\nThankfully, there&apos;s the final ten minutes. As many other viewers have noted, the climax is worth viewing in itself. Think a more outrageous, blood-splattered Asian version of John Carpenter&apos;s THE THING, and you have the right idea. I wanted more of that! Overall, SEEDING OF A GHOST was hardly as off-the-wall, gross, and skin-crawling as I was hoping for. It&apos;s more in line with the rest of the Hong Kong films I&apos;ve seen, in the sense that all it wants to do is please the viewer, not necessarily scare him or disturb him. Hong Kong fans should seek out the incredible (and very similar in tone) SEVENTH CURSE with Chow Yun-Fat over this one.",

      "reviewBody": "Barry Levinson&apos;s LIBERTY HEIGHTS begins telling it&apos;s story through a variety of different viewpoints, and at the outset may give off the vibe of being somewhat unfocussed, but do not be misled by the elusive opening! Although unexceptional in terms of it&apos;s standard coming of age plotline, as the film progresses it becomes increasingly thoughtful and observant.  It is the small details that make LIBERTY HEIGHTS seem so rich--and I wouldn&apos;t dream of giving any of them away--but needless to say, by the end of the film anyone who remembers their childhood fondly is bound to leave the theatre with a smile on their face.  In a quiet and unassuming way, the movie manages to throw out many messages to its audience.  Every single subplot in the film relates back to the family.  Joe Mantegna plays the racketeering patriarch of a nice uppper-middle class Jewish family that resembles a lighter version of the Corleone&apos;s in THE GODFATHER.  One of the sons falls for a Catholic girl, while the other pursues the black daughter of a prominent city doctor.  They all live with their grandmother who is blinded to the &quot;gentiles&quot; by the Holocaust.  The relationships between the youngsters naturally conflict with the views of their parents, and they are forced to form their own opinions on racial boundaries. \n\n What is so refreshing about LIBERTY HEIGHTS is that it doesn&apos;t pull obvious punches or go for the cheap thrills that more sensationalized Hollywood films normally would.  Not even in a subplot with an eccentric drug dealer do the characters resort to violence as might be expected with this sort of material.  The characters in LIBERTY HEIGHTS are just ordinary people in relatively ordinary situations.  It is not a fast paced film, some may find the midsection to be a little over-inflated.  Personally I enjoyed the film a great deal.  It grew on me to the point that by the end I was drawn to tears.  Even fully aware of its old fashioned Hollywood corniness the movie touched a nerve with me.  I found the performances very moving--in particular that of young Ben Foster, who we should exepect to see again in the near future.  Adrien Brody is appealing and sympathetic as the eldest son.  Bebe Neuwirth manages to create some interesting moments in her role as matriarch of the Kurtzman family--particularly in the final scene. LIBERTY HEIGHTS is not a perfect film to be sure, but in a season with a shortage of intelligent family oriented films LIBERTY HEIGHTS is a solid bet.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Shadow Line&apos; is about an able, intelligent young seaman who resigns his position, only to receive unexpectedly the command of another ship after the death of its captain. This early, land-set section is perhaps a little plodding. The interaction of the narrator with various other characters, and the details of how he comes to assume his captaincy, serve in Conrad&apos;s novel to deepen our understanding of him, to see both his strengths and weaknesses, and observe how he was both ill- and well-prepared for leadership. Wajda tends to err on the side of mere scene-setting, failing to invest scenes that could easily have been reduced without affecting the essential narrative with the thematic and psychological significance achieved by Conrad. An additional, mild annoyance is the over-the-top mugging by John Bennett as the supine keeper of a boarding-house; fortunately, it&apos;s a small part, and compensation is provided by Martin Wyldeck (an actor quite unknown to me), who is very enjoyable as a wily old mariner with a rather donnish demeanour.\n\nOnce the story takes to the seas, all reservations fade, for what follows is superb cinema. It manages to capture the sense of being at sea as well as any movie I know, including the excellent &apos;Master and Commander&apos;. What makes the difference here, however, is that whereas most ocean-set films either depict the ship&apos;s struggle against the awesome, hostile elements of storms and towering waves, or delight in the bracing freshness and freedom of having a fair wind at the sails, &apos;The Shadow Line&apos; tells the story of a becalmed ship, barely drifting through the water, its crew sweltering in the oppressive heat and laid low by illness, their fate possibly in the hands of the malevolent spirit of their late captain. It&apos;s an unusual proposition for a cinematic entertainment: stillness, silence and accumulating claustrophobia. In lesser hands, the result could easily have been dull. But the fine performances (including that of a young Tom Wilkinson - although he looks middle-aged even here) and the sharp cinematography (sometimes vivid to the point of unreality) enable the power of Conrad&apos;s tale to be conveyed surprisingly successfully.\n\nThe performance of Marek Kondrat in the main role is extremely impressive: authoritative, yet retaining the sense of doubt and inexperience so crucial to Conrad&apos;s (self-)portrayal. Taking the form of a retrospective &apos;confession&apos; the book deals with the emotional development of the protagonist, his traversing of the &apos;shadow line&apos; between youth and maturity  a change that entails both loss and gain. Conrad&apos;s narrator is significantly anonymous; this gesture towards universality is strengthened by the frequent use of impersonal &apos;one&apos;, as in &apos;one thinks&apos;, &apos;one does&apos;, etc. At the same time, the author allows us to the read the tale as a coded autobiography, with the figure of the young, sea-struck Pole a version of his own younger self  and the older, wiser narrator looking back on his rite of passage as a version of the 60-year-old novelist. The story&apos;s significance is thus simultaneously general and particular, both universal and individual. The film adaptation pushes the autobiographical element further by naming the hero &apos;Joseph Conrad&apos; (and I wonder if the lead actor&apos;s name is entirely coincidental); the youthful captain&apos;s conduct in command is a presage of the literary genius to come. Conrad&apos;s entire oeuvre (including the other books, such as &apos;Heart of Darkness&apos;, that Wajda considered filming) is thus in part a product of these early experiences; the passage into leadership and maturity (though not necessarily wisdom), the passing of the shadow line, is the crucial development that enables great literature - and great cinema - to be created. If only more literary adaptations displayed such intelligent engagement with their source texts instead of being content merely to illustrate them according to the genteel standards of decorum and respectability.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie a long time ago and parts of it really stuck with me, but I couldn&apos;t even remember the name until I came across it recently. I think, part of the effect of the movie was the sultry Marlene Dietrich, but what I didn&apos;t realize is that this movie is so full of atmosphere and rich in texture that it stays with you no matter who is in it. To be honest, most of the acting in this film is pretty wooden. Dietrich rises above all others with her ability to convey her feelings through the camera. More than anything, this film&apos;s look and feel are what really make this film work; and to some degree the lighting and directing aid Dietrich&apos;s acting. Joseph Von Sternberg directed this film about a group of passengers traveling via train during a Chinese civil war. The passengers all have their own stories, but none is as interesting as the story of Shanghai Lilly (Dietrich) and her romance with the British officer Captain &quot;Doc&quot; Harvey (Clive Brook). Von Sternberg uses light and shadow to highlight different characters and the character&apos;s feelings long before anyone else used this technique to such a large degree. There are marvelous images of Dietrich, Anna May Wong and Warner Oland as a rather mysterious and possibly sinister train passenger that really make this movie click. Film students should be required to see this movie for the simplicity of the story and the complexity of the filming. I&apos;d like to say no scene is wasted, but there are a couple scenes that seemed extraneous. Overall though, this is a classic movie that was way ahead of it&apos;s time. I wasn&apos;t really familiar with Von Sternberg until I went back and watched this movie again. Now I own the DVD and I watch it periodically to remind myself of Dietrich&apos;s allure and Von Sternberg&apos;s masterful direction.",

He has since filed for a divorce and meet my sister who lives in Fresno California. Im leaving their names out for specific reasons. So please bear with me. Before her husband had been murdered he suspected his wife might be trying to have him killed and changed his life insurance policy and will leaving his brother everything. After the murder when she tried to collect the money she was extremely upset to find out she wasn&apos;t getting a dime and was to leave his property immediately. Angeline Jolie did an excellent job of portraying the woman. This is a must see film!!!!!!!",

First half has the eventual character introduction and one can slowly find themselves getting into the movie in no second.The way the scenes inside the flat has been shot shows the exact visuals the director had in mind.The impact the movie has can travel with your mind at least for a day. This type of genre exploration and story exploration is new to tamil cinema and it has been well put together. Although there are flaws, lets appreciate and welcome such talents to our industry. We need more of them rather than the commercial ones. We see many people watching and appreciating the movie after the DVD gets released. (Includes Me Too) This happens only when the movie has been taken the wrong way in terms of promotion.. Being in the technical generation, one can easily reach the mass through social networks. Still this movie lacked to reach the public as the content in their promotion had major lacks.Initial first look posters, typo, trailer and teaser cuts for this movie did not have the same impact as the movie. One cannot blame the crew and the director for this and the promotions for a movie gets around the brains of many people these days.",

Its a simple pastoral romance written by one of the greatest Bengali writers, Tarashankar. Ray always knew the importance of the story, and he chose wisely from writers like Bibhutibhushan, Tagore and others. In this movie, made in a retro sepia tone which promotes a feeling of otherworldliness and decrepitude at the same time, Ray sticks to the storyline and elicits some great performances from Soumitra, Waheeda Rahman, Robi Ghosh and the magnificent Charuprakash Ghosh, a Ray favorite, who nails the difficult role of the seedy bania as counterpoint to Soumitra&apos;s ramrod Punjabi taxi driver. The strange admixture of the arid rural landscapes, ramshackle Chevrolet cabs, drunken depot operators, nepotist petty officials, prostitutes, smugglers and Christians comes together in a sweeping narrative that never rests for a moment in its grand mission - to tell a story to a spellbound audience."

I admit I have a huge bias towards movies about thieves: the artistry of their trade fascinates me (and explains why I can&apos;t get enough of playing &quot;Thief&quot; the computer game series).\n\nNevertheless, this was an engrossing turn of the century period piece which is filled with brilliant, subtle characterizations of extremely interesting and complex characters. It&apos;s exciting without needing to be fast paced and it doesn&apos;t sacrifice depth of emotion (which is repressed but fully present under the surface as these characters must constantly re-evaluate their involvement in their chosen lifestyles).\n\nThe film is beautifully structured so that by the end of it we, who have been voyeuristically caught up in the romance of suave criminals, must, like them, take stock of what has been lost.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I did not expect to cry on my American Airlines flight, but here we are.\n\nWhat a lovely hidden gem this movie is! I wouldn&apos;t call this a &quot;kid&apos;s&quot; movie, but one that the whole family could watch together. After all, it&apos;s a story about a family with four generations of women.\n\nI appreciate stories that explore the complex relationship between mothers and daughters. While I have a healthy relationship with my own mother today, I remember the rocky patches we went through in the past, especially during my teenage years. I could relate to Mary as she became frustrated with her mother and struggled with the emotional trauma of her grandmother dying. However, I loved that the film had her grow as a character and become kinder and more accepting of her mother, and vice versa. It&apos;s refreshing when a &quot;bratty&quot; character can develop throughout the plot and become redeemed at the end.\n\nSpeaking of Mary, I also loved the relationship between her and her grandmother, as it reminds me of the relationship I have with my own grandmother. Being an adult in my 20s, I sadly do not have much time left with my grandma. This film touched me because it explored the topic of grief with fragility yet authenticity. It teaches viewers that it&apos;s okay to be sad and angry and experience all the feelings that come with grief, yet it assures us that there is hope in the future as we navigate our new normal without our loved ones.\n\nBeing an animation afficionado, I appreciated the charming art style and bright colors the film possessed. It was also neat to experience a bit of Ireland&apos;s culture, as I am from the United States and have never been anywhere in Europe.\n\nMy only critique is that some of the songs within the film made it feel a little too &quot;kiddy.&quot; Like I mentioned earlier, I believe this film can be enjoyed by anyone of any age, but the musical number-style scenes squarely put it into the &quot;for kids&quot; category. Not a huge complaint, but I would have appreciated some more subtle background music during these scenes.\n\nOverall, if you can watch this film, either on American Airline&apos;s app or by paying for it, I highly recommend you do.",

      "reviewBody": "Jack Pickford plays Johnny Spivins, a character not unlike himself, in this light romantic comedy. He&apos;s immature, lazy and generally unreliable. His boss at the grocery store where he clerks puts up with him for a lot longer than I would have. Everything that he does seems to turn out wrong, but it is hard to have much sympathy for him because he is such a lout. But for some unfathomable reason, Millie Fields, the town&apos;s sweetheart (played by Marguerite De La Motte) loves him anyway. City slicker Morgan Coleman (George Dromgold) shows up to make Johnny jealous, but everyone, except maybe Johnny, knows that Millie really loves him. Towards the end of the movie, Johnny finally does one thing right (I won&apos;t spoil it for you by saying what), and all is forgiven. The film also features a remarkable mongrel dog with a crippled left foreleg, who, despite his handicap, can do amazing things like walk on his hind legs and close doors and drive a buggy with the reins in his teeth. All told, this photo play is a pleasant evening&apos;s diversion.",

      "reviewBody": "A must see for any fans of Asian extreme cinema. This is all that Kill Bill was unable to be and shows that Tarantino is but a poor imitator of the best Asia has to offer.\n\n20 years after 5 childhood best friends close a bottle of alcohol with a serpent inside one of the five, Wang-Jae (Kil-Kang Ahn) is murdered by a bunch of young hooligans. Before his death Wang-Jae was an ex-mafioso boss, that settled down and opened a bar, still remaining an influential figure in the neighbourhood. Tae-su is a Seul cop, the best on the force and a real terror for everyone that has to do with crime. Dong-hwan (Seok-yong Jeong), a geeky teacher and Seok-hwan (Seung-wan Ryoo), a small-time crook, are brothers jointly caring for their 60-year old mother. Pil-ho (Beom-su Lee) is the crime lord of the city after Wang-Jae&apos;s retirement.\n\nAfter the funeral Tae-Su in search of the killers of Wang-Jae decides to stay for a bit longer in the city. It quickly turns out that the case will force brother to go against brother and for the best friends to fight each other...\n\nThe movie lost a couple of points for not being able to properly balance the comedic with the dramatic with certain fragments standing out as if from a totally different movie. Also some of the fight sequences were too long and tiresome. There are better Asian movies out there, but still a recommended, if flawed movie. And no Tarantino hack can capture the strengths of the Asian revenge flick.",

      "reviewBody": "Much have been raved about Matthew Chukiat Sakveerakul&apos;s The Love of Siam, and thankfully I had managed to catch this on screen after it&apos;s been playing for some time over here on only one screen. Sakveerakul is perhaps more famous here for his thriller 13 Beloved (renamed 13: Game of Death here), but through this film had demonstrated he&apos;s equally adept at telling a romance and family drama.\n\nThe prologue for the film is somewhat extended, setting the stage for the lead characters. We have Mew (Witwisit Hiranyawongjul) who spends his childhood with his grandmother (Pimpan Buranapim), whose neighbours are a tight knit Catholic family headed by dad Korn (Songsit Roongniphakunsri), domineering mother Sunee (Sinraj Plengpanit), and children Tong (Mario Maurer) and Tang (Laila Boonyasak). A hiking trip resulted in the disappearance of Tang, and the grieving family moves away, temporarily grinding the friendship of the two boys Mew and Tong, to a halt.\n\nFast forward to today, Mew is now the brains and lead singer behind his huge boy band August, and is being courted by neighbour Ying (Kanya Rattapetch). Tong too faces girlfriend woes, where the school flower and spoilt brat Donut (Aticha Pongsilpipat, in a rather needless role here compared to Rattapetch&apos;s) faces a nonchalant Tong and draws an ultimatum of sorts. Sparks fly when the two boys reunite by chance on the streets, sparking into motion a series of events that would inevitably lead to a homosexual romance.\n\nWhile it&apos;s easy to fall into a gimmicky promotional angle using the love between Tong and Mew, this film offered a lot more, especially that between Tong&apos;s family members. The missing Tang had caused Korn to become an insufferable alcoholic, while the mother stoically holds the family together, and the last thing she expects is for Tong to develop a liking for Mew. This segment of the story kicked into melodramatic overdrive when mom Sunee, with the help of the boys, convinces their friend June (also played by Laila Boonyasak), a dead ringer for her child, to pose as Tang and to snap Korn out of his depression.\n\nSakveerakul managed to weave into the narrative the different kinds of love all into one film - the unrequited, first crushes, first love, unconditional ones as given by parents to child, even stand-by-mes encouragement, support as seen by the members of August, and of course, bromance. With the family angle, there&apos;s the theme of coming to terms, and learning to let go, which I felt was the richer of the two main threads running through the narrative.\n\nIt&apos;s a beautiful film, not only because having a bevy of pretty looking cast members helped, but also because it had a wonderful looking set of production sets and values, and while I have to rely on the subtitles to understand the song lyrics, the melodies here are simply marvelous. Korea and Japan had to watch out, because Sakveerakul has shown that Thailand is fast catching up in making heartfelt, coming of age romances that would tug at your heartstrings. \n\nWhat&apos;s more interesting here is that the film is rated M18, without a cut detected, and even more so, the kissing scenes between Mew and Tong were left intact. Many years ago, there would be a straight out censorship snip at the scene to the cutting room floor, and in more recent times, a scene like this would be shortened and slapped with an R21 rating. An M18 rating for this seemed to point to a relaxation of the rules, though A Frozen Flower had demonstrated that sex between men are still snipped and slapped with an R21 rating.",

The newspaper proclaims her to be a new heiress. In reality, Hank was prown to tall tales and his will is no exception. Alison boards a ship to American and is followed by some men with an eye for her. Terence Keath is an indebted gambler looking to steal her fortune. Vincent Maran (James Whitmore) is watching over him for his boss Lucky Reilly who owns Terence&apos;s papers. Rich bachelor Jeremy Tayler is traveling with his lawyer Matthew Kinston who is suspicious of Alison.\n\nThe funniest scene is probably the group of old men reading old Hank&apos;s will. I love the donkey. The whole section is deadpan hilarity. The rest of the movie is a bit bland. I don&apos;t know if Kerr has any comedic chops. She shows a bit of it here or there but she needs to be so much more wackier. The writing doesn&apos;t give her enough telephone poles to help her get there. The guys do have some fun at times. Whitmore comes the closest with his constant frustration. It&apos;s light. It&apos;s harmless. It&apos;s nearly funny.",

      "reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised by this film. From a simple premise as &quot;lying doesn&apos;t exist&quot; it develops into a thoughtful tale with a touch of satire. On the one hand it exposes early on the basic first impressions we all have of each other and of situations we find ourselves in. On the other, it touches on the importance of being honest about what we know and especially honest about what we don&apos;t know.\n\nI could examine all the inconsistencies inherent to a concept like this. One would think that without the concept of duplicity, we should be far more advanced than we currently are. One would also think that without lying, there would be no imagination and therefore very few scientific discoveries and advances. The story requires that you don&apos;t think about that too much, just to enjoy the script as it moves along.\n\nGervais carries the film along as planned, in his quiet, self-effacing way. The humor won&apos;t have you rolling on the floor, but the frankness of the casual insights should make anyone snicker with self-awareness at the truth of it all.",

Oh, the story is fun and the gadgets are cool, but those sets really sell the film. They would inspire countless imitations and variations throughout the years.\n\nFinally, we get to see Bloefeld, and it&apos;s a bit of a letdown. Donald Pleasance is a fine actor, but he&apos;s not quite supervillain material; more of the serial killer variety, in the mold of Peter Lorre. Still, he is by far the superior on-screen version.\n\nThe Japanese cast are all outstanding. Special mention should be made of Peter Maivia, grandfather of Dwayne Johson, aka The Rock. He and the stuntmen create a brutal fight scene, second only to the train fight in FRWL, although this is perhaps more inventive.\n\nAs for gadgets, outside of the jetpack from Thundrball and Goldfinger&apos;s Aston Martin, Little Nellie is the coolest ride. The aerial scenes are spectacular and are one of the highpoints of the whole series.\n\nThis film really marks the end of the ultra-cool Bond films. After this, they tend to go down in quality, taken as a whole. Some have better stories and villains, some have better stunts, but they are never the complete package that the earlier films were. Still, this one (along with Goldfinger and Thunderball) would inspire every spy work that would follow; from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. to Our Man Flint, Marvel Comics&apos; Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.e.L.D., to the X-Men. Everyone stole an idea from here."

      "reviewBody": "The Brady Bunch Movie is a fine tribute to the original television series and the film retains enough of the humor from the series to make the film work, despite an entire new cast. However, I liked the decision for Paramount to have some cameos from the likes of Florence Henderson and the late Ann B. Davis. The film is a bit campy at time, but it takes some getting used to. The jokes are really good, but the main joke is seeing how the Bradys react in the 1990&apos;s, and fortunately that joke did not disappoint.\n\nBetty Thomas&apos;s film has all the original characters from the television series, including my favorite: Alice the housekeeper. A scheming neighbor of the Bradys plan to take their house unless they can raise twenty thousand dollars. They discover that participating in a musical may be their only bet to keep their property.\n\nThe film was not badly acted. The new actors retained enough of the characters wit to be effective. Shelley Long and Gary Cole as the parents were very good. Christine Taylor as the eldest daughter, Marcia is also very good and beautiful! Michael McKean is effective as the scheming neighbor. Finally, Henriette Mantel as Alice actually reminded me of Ann B. Davis&apos;s Alice very much so.\n\nOverall, The Brady Bunch Movie is an effective comedy and a successful reboot showing a new generation the wonders of the Brady family. The movie often movies into slapstick territory and relies on physical comedy perhaps a bit too much, but that doesn&apos;t hurt the film too much. Nothing beats the original Brady family, but this Brady family was very good and quite funny. This is the story of how 1970 met 1995 to pretty funny results. I rate this film 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Have for some time regarded Edward G. Robinson very highly as an actor, he was often a scene stealer in support and he had more than enough presence when he was a lead. Seeing Boris Karloff in a prolific year for him and Aline MacMahon in her first film added to the interest. As well as that it was directed by Mervyn LeRoy, who also directed &apos;Random Harvest&apos; (a particularly wonderful film of his). Any film that explores the dark side of journalism should be applauded.\n\n&apos;Five Star Final&apos; managed to be a very well done and powerful film. Well made, very well written and strongly acted, on the most part regarding the acting with a couple of exceptions. Anybody that loves Robinson, Karloff and LeRoy will be more than delighted. The subject is a bold one and well worth addressing, it was very relevant at the time and is also very relevant now. Even more so now and even worse than back then, scarily so.\n\nThe film is not perfect by all means. Some of the acting is patchy. Nancy is a dull character and Frances Starr has very little warmth and presence in the part. Ona Munson&apos;s character annoyed me to no end and Munson overdoes it.\n\nOccasionally &apos;Five Star Final&apos; is a little corny, but thankfully those moments are hardly any.\n\nIt is stylishly filmed and has a good amount of atmosphere and grit. The decision to not use music was a good one, meaning that in my view the dialogue and subject resonates more without worrying about potential intrusiveness. There are some clever use of sound effects, the sound of machines being almost eerie. LeRoy really allows the drama to remain gripping throughout the entire film and the film is leanly and intelligently scripted.\n\nMoreover, the story is very absorbing. Personally don&apos;t think it has dated at all and absolutely agree with everybody that says that its theme is still relevant today (as said already one could say that it is more so today and to a degree that is enough to shock, can&apos;t believe that there are people still that believe everything they believe in the press). What is shown here, meaning the dark side of journalism, is very disarming and honest with the film being quite uncompromising which helps make it all the more powerful.\n\nRobinson is truly excellent in the lead role and nothing short of magnetic. Matched more than ideally by shifty Karloff, an extremely impressive debuting MacMahon and heartfelt HB Warner. Marian Marsh also gives a brave performance and is very moving in her final scene which is agreed one of the dramatic highlights.\n\nTo conclude, very well done. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "This film involves you from the beginning and you stay with it until the end. It is, after all, a mystery and we wish to find out what happened. The script is rather intelligent and it is peopled with believable characters for the most part. It is a black comedy and we have a portrait of a small town with universally recognized characteristics.\n\nOur hero with ambitions to be a reporter goes to visit the town where his cousin died in order to find out what happened. He meets great resistance from the small minded members of this small minded town and thus the drama ensues. You immediately identify with the problems and bumbling nature of our reporter hero and you can feel sympathy for his many difficulties. However, the real hero of the film is Gunther who has died. In flash backs we witness his life before its untimely end and we can understand what happened by the end of this film. He is a long-suffering individual who is very different from everyone else in the village.\n\nI have a few problems regarding believability of some of the character development but I can not go into detail because it could reveal too much of the film. This is a somewhat kinky film in the true traditions of black comedy and I feel most people will respect this film.",

Both movies, Salman gave a lousy performance, which he usually doe not do. Karishma Kapoor has also made many Flops, add another on her career. Every Karishma movie in her entire career, she always acts immature in at least one scene. This movie is an example of her acting childish, unrealistic and very immature. She is the type of actress mainly for the younger audience or for girls that dream a lot. If i see Karishma i will kich her arse. David Dhawan has given us many entertaining movies, but sadly he disappoints. The supporting cast were OK. Johnny Lever, Kader Khan, Anupom Kher, Paresh Rawail and Om Puri are funny as usual. There is one good song, which is why i gave the movie a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Salman delivers a dreadful performance as the man that loves taking his shirt of for know damn reason. Karishma is dreadful as usual, I&apos;m so glad she retired, and made a Super Flop comeback. This is a complete garbage and not worth the watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Mild comedy starring Ginger Rogers as a corset shop owner who goes broke and becomes a traveling saleslady in 1897 Texas. But because she owes money she ends up selling barbed wire. Very strange premise but a decent cast and a few good lines here and there save this one.\n\nRogers&apos; modeling assistant is none other than Carol Channing, in Hollywood after her smash success on Broadway in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. And she&apos;s not bad at all. Channing does a quickie song called A Corset Can Do a Lot for a Lady and she&apos;s hilarious, altering between her trademark Channing voice and some basso sounds that sound like Bea Arthur. Too bad the direction--as usual--cuts away from her to show the man behind the desk. Musicals always did this--cut away from the performer to show the audience.\n\nJames Arness is the rancher. Barry Nelson is the car owner. David Brian is the steel man. Clint Eastwood is the cavalry man. Robert F. Simon is a henchman. \n\nWhat helps sink this is the overall cheap look and bad color. Rogers would star in 2 more films and then appear only sporadically. Channing would not appear in a film for another decade but would win an Oscar nomination for it--Thoroughly Modern Millie. And this is NOT Channing&apos;s film debut as is often stated. She had appeared in Paid in Full in 1950. But this was Eastwood&apos;s first screen kiss---with Carol Channing!"

He has appeared in many films, this is the first of them I&apos;ve seen. In this one he struts around shirtless in a mask, tights and gaudy red cape. Santo is summoned by the authorities much the way Batman is to deal with master criminals on the loose. In this case it&apos;s a scientist who tries to control blob like giant space microbes. The costume for the blob is a bunch of guys covered in a camouflage colored plastic sheet. You can see the obvious shapes of the men under the sheets when the blob attacks.\n\nThe fight sequences between Santos and the bad guys are dragged out and badly choreographed. They&apos;re unintentionally funny at first, then seem to go on forever. Aside from those scenes the rest of the film is classic &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&apos; fun."

      "reviewBody": "When I was a little kid I used to be in awe when a president&apos;s speech was broadcast on TV.  I did not watch the speeches (what child would?) but I was struck by a feeling that they were extremely important.  Decisions were being set in motion, I thought.  So when I grew up I was surprised to realize that all along it had only been a bunch of hot air.  This movie is a document of such hot air.  A behind the scenes documentary of a &apos;94 Senate race in Virginia, A Perfect Candidate is both funny and depressing.  If you have any hope left that your vote counts for something, that optimism may be destroyed after seeing this movie.\n\nIt&apos;s Oliver North against Chuck Robb.  Robb comes off as very dull/awkward.  There is an amazing moment when a reporter asks him if he is in favor of replacing striking workers at factories.  Robb says his position on that issue has not changed.  So you&apos;re in favor of strike worker replacement? &quot;No.&quot; You&apos;re against it? &quot;I did not say that.&quot;  Robb then offers a reply which completely dodges the question and walks off.\n\nNorth is a smoother politician, but you still don&apos;t trust his smile. He makes the requisite church appearance, endorses Jesus, and tells the people it&apos;s such a relief to talk about something besides politics-as if his running for Senator has nothing to do with why he is speaking at this church.  I only came here this morning because I&apos;m Christian just like you, he wants them to believe.\n\nWe see North tell college students that he never lied to congress. When asked how he feels about the potentially racist implications of flying a Confederate flag, North makes the suspicious claim that he recently saw Robb wearing a Confederate necktie.  As this happens a reporter backstage tells a North strategist that this claim sounds fishy, North&apos;s helper responds with a shrug.  Apparently he&apos;s not the least bit disturbed that his candidate may have just told a blatant lie.\n\nThere is a lot of footage of North&apos;s campaign strategists.  At one point we see one person privately admitting that politics only offer entertainment.  But &quot;what we are not offering are solutions...not us, not not anybody.&quot;  It&apos;s almost refreshing for somebody to come right out and admit it.\n\nIf you are tired of two-faced politicians and their ever-present vague promises of &quot;change&quot;, you need to track this movie down.  It is honest, and good for a laugh.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Big Trees&quot; is one of those entertaining films regularly churned out by major studios in the early to mid-50s which were fun for the whole family and offended no one. Usually directed in efficient, workmanlike fashion (in this case, by Felix Feist) and essentially plot-driven by some sort of conflict that required physical measures to resolve, these programmers moved along with a fast pace and lots of action that left little room for subtleties but usually gave the moviegoing public its bang for the buck.\n\nThe conflict here is a stalemate between entrepreneurish lumbermen who want to cut down the giant Redwoods in California&apos;s northlands to sell the lumber for huge profits and a Quaker-like religious sect that has already settled on the land and views these big trees as majestic creations of the Almighty that should be left untouched. The former are led by smooth-talking Jim Fallon (Kirk Douglas) who, in trying to take advantage of a recent Act of Congress, oozes his unctuous charm to gain the settlers confidence for a peaceful live-and-let-live coexistence. When the latter continue to defend their big trees - especially Elder Bixley (Charles Meredith) and his daughter Alicia Chadwick (Eve Miller) - he resorts to legal maneuvers which are again stymied. The deadlock is finally breached when rival lumbermen, who have even fewer scruples than Fallon, move in for a piece of the action and violence ensues.\n\nSeveral commenters on this page have already rightly stated that &quot;The Big Trees&quot; is Kirk Douglas&apos;s least favorite of all his films. That&apos;s understandable when one considers the many classics and near-classics in his filmography - &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;, &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, &quot;Champion&quot;, &quot;Detective Story&quot;, &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot;, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot;, and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; by directors such as Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Billy Wilder, William Wyler, Vincent Minnelli, Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer - it&apos;s no wonder that a medium-budgeted actioner about fortune seeking loggers at odds with an environmentally-conscious religious sect should find itself sitting at the back of the class.\n\nAnd yet I think Kirk has been too hard on this movie. The outdoor locations, filmed near Humbolt County in Northern California are at once awe inspiring and breathtaking, the colour (on good prints) gorgeous, the supporting cast featuring Edgar Buchanan and Patrice Wymore more than adequate, and the action scenes, particularly the runaway train, set the adrenaline rushing.\n\nBest of all is Douglas himself. He has never been more charismatic than he is here. Whereas in other films he brought an unnerving intensity that sometimes bordered on paranoia to his hard-driven complex characters, he is here at once a likeable scoundrel: jovial, charming, gentlemanly yet virile and athletic, performing his own stunts when called upon. A remarkable performance, made more remarkable by the fact that he made this picture for no salary in order to end his contract with Warner Bros. He easily could have sleepwalked through the role but didn&apos;t, or at least didn&apos;t appear to. A very professional gesture.\n\nWhat weakens &quot;The Big Trees&quot; is the lack of a strong villain. John Archer (Frenchy) is unable to do much with a part that is badly underwritten. He is neither cunning nor threatening as he inexplicably transmogrifies from Mr. Bland to Mr. Bad and certainly does not deserve the horrific fate that eventually befalls him. Fortunately, Kirk Douglas is there to remind viewers what star power - even in a programmer - is all about.",

I&apos;m a big fan of military movies, and I just couldn&apos;t get past the constant technical gaffes in this film.  F-16s and Mirages flown from a US aircraft carrier?  The scenes on the &quot;Ohio Class&quot; submarine look like they were filmed in an oil refinery, complete with concrete floors.  Much of the footage was stock footage or footage I recognized from other films.  I actually turned it off during the final action scene.  If you don&apos;t know an F-16 from an F-14 or a hot water heater from a missile tube, you might be OK with this.  If you do, forget it!"

      "reviewBody": "&apos;My Best Friend&apos; is one of the most fascinating documentaries I&apos;ve ever seen about movies and acting. Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski only made five movies together, but what extraordinary movies they are! Kinski made many, many movies, many of them absolutely awful (though all worth watching even if only for him). In fact it&apos;s difficult to think of any other actor of his undoubted talent who slummed it quite as much as he did. Herzog is regarded as one of Germany&apos;s greatest ever directors and made many fine movies without Kinski, but the two together were really something special. Just watch the astonishing &apos;Aguirre: The Wrath Of God&apos; if you want to be floored by total genius! Much of this documentary deals with the trials and tribulations of that movie&apos;s troubled shoot, but their other four collaborations are also discussed. Their relationship was a complex one and really hard to get your head around. At times they literally tried to kill each other, but then there&apos;s footage included that shows their obvious warmth and affection for each other. You could say that this documentary provokes more questions than answers, and if you are looking for a straightforward explanation of Kinski&apos;s behaviour and what Herzog REALLY thought about him then maybe you could regard this as a failure. Anyway, I was enthralled and I think any fan of Kinski must regard this as essential viewing. From the opening footage of a raving Kinski on stage proclaiming he was Christ to the final moments of a butterfly flitting around his face this is mesmerizing stuff, and not to be missed by anyone with every a remote interest in this unique actor. Highly recommended!"

I really liked his artist type guy who seduces Emma Russell, he was great fun.\n\nAs for the story, well...I didn&apos;t bother to check for anomalies, I knew I&apos;d find plenty. I only have two more things to say:\n\n1. Elisabeth Shue is absolutely stunningly beautiful in this film.\n\n2. The cool car that we only get to see a few seconds is a Volvo C70, a worthy replacement for the Volvo P1800 that Moore&apos;s Saint drove around in.",

      "reviewBody": "I feel a bit guilty, reading some of the other reviews posted, but I liked MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE! Perhaps because I was never &apos;into&apos; the cartoon series, I am more forgiving of characters or plot devices left out, and I certainly recognize that it is derivative of both STAR WARS and FLASH GORDON (particularly in Bill Conti&apos;s bombastic musical score), but there is so much energy in the film, such abundant confidence in the ultimate victory of Good versus Evil, and such a wonderfully campy performance by Frank Langella as rubber-masked Skeletor that I get a kick out of it, whenever it airs.\n\nPhysically, no actor could be more perfect as the hero, He-Man, than ROCKY 4&apos;s Dolph Lundgren. At 6&apos;6&quot; (that&apos;s two inches taller than JOHN WAYNE, trivia fans!), with flowing blond hair and blue eyes, the 30-year old Swedish actor combined a Herculean physique (if Marvel Comics&apos; &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; is ever filmed, he would be perfect as the Thunder God), with a knack for weapons that would earn him the future title of &apos;King&apos; of &apos;B&apos; action flicks. True, his English was so poor at the time of filming that his dialog was kept to a minimum, but who watches this kind of film for dialog, anyway?\n\nSupporting Lundgren&apos;s He-Man is crusty veteran soldier, Duncan (Man-at-Arms), played by character actor Jon Cypher, who makes up for He-Man&apos;s taciturn nature by reminiscing constantly about a life in the military (with observations EVERY soldier has made, through history), and his daughter, Teela (pretty Chelsea Field, one of the busiest actresses of the decade), serving as a &quot;Xena Lite&quot; for the proceedings.\n\nOpposing the Forces of Good with the irreplaceable Langella is one of my favorite actresses, Meg Foster, as the sublimely wicked Evil-Lyn, using her piercing green eyes and barely suppressed sexuality to great advantage. With an array of the cartoon&apos;s more colorful villains in support of Skeletor and Evil-Lyn, He-Man has his hands full!\n\nThe plot involves a tonal &apos;key&apos;, created by a dwarf, Gwildor (screen legend Billy Barty, in an initially irritating, but eventually endearing role), that can transport individuals wherever they desire. Stolen by Evil-Lyn, Skeletor uses it to capture He-Man&apos;s Castle Greyskull and it&apos;s resident Sorceress (&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; alum Christina Pickles). With a hidden prototype &apos;key&apos;, Gwildor leads our heroes into the castle...where they are nearly captured by Skeletor, before the dwarf throws together some random numbers, and transports our heroes...to Earth.\n\nThe &apos;key&apos; is lost, as the four arrive on our planet, to be found by aspiring musician Kevin Corrigan (&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; star Robert Duncan McNeill) who thinks it&apos;s a Japanese musical instrument! With girlfriend Julie Winston (future &quot;Friends&quot; superstar Courteney Cox, looking young and gorgeous), the pair are astonished by the musical complexities of the device, unaware that each time it is &apos;played&apos;, Skeletor is getting a better &apos;fix&apos; of it&apos;s location. Eventually, our planet is pinpointed, and Skeletor leads an army of villains to subdue us, and capture He-Man. \n\nWith great comic support by bald character actor James Tolkan (BACK TO THE FUTURE), as a bewildered police detective, some spectacular &apos;set&apos; pieces (Skeletor&apos;s invasion force, backed by &apos;Darth Vader&apos;ish music, is a highlight), and an ending that concludes that &quot;ANYTHING is possible&quot;, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE is great cheesy fun! \n\nCertainly, the film is not a classic, but if you accept it on it&apos;s own terms, I think you might find it to be a lot of fun!"

If you know William Castle&apos;s work, you know to expect low-budget chills that don&apos;t take themselves very seriously.  What&apos;s surprising about this film is that it&apos;s actually fairly sophisticated.  The plot has some excellent twists; the chills are more psychological and less gore-dependent than in other Castle films I can think of; and it&apos;s just fun to see two great (albeit aging) stars get their teeth into a horror script. Barbara Stanwyck is excellent, and Robert Taylor comes a close second. \n\n Why this little gem isn&apos;t available on DVD with (what I consider to be) lesser Castle works baffles me.  It&apos;s definitely worth seeking out for your next cheesy horror fest.",

I don&apos;t know who&apos;s been paid off but there a few above average reviews of this film around and it makes no sense, some even say how in touch the makers are with the real horror fan, a classic homage to traditional slashers, they must have watched a different film.\n\nBudget horror is great but rubbish like this will probably put people of funding it!",

      "reviewBody": "I can totally understand how someone can have a lack of compassion for animals. By the end of this documentary I felt somewhat numb myself, from the ceaseless onslaught of horror contained within. So if you&apos;re brought up, for instance, in a hunting culture, or a biblical culture, or an &quot;animal manufacturing&quot; culture, or the outskirts of a bull-fighting ring, you&apos;re probably numb to the suffering of living things, too. What this movie sets out to do is climb into the minds of those who have lost perspective for whatever reason and remind them that if they&apos;re still mistreating animals, or participating in the mistreatment of animals, then they&apos;re not fulfilling a major responsibility of being human, and are therefore part human, semi-human, sub-human.\n\nCall me a softy, but I&apos;ve felt for a long, long time that there&apos;s really no fundamental difference between humans and other animals. Therefore, animals experience things like pain, despair, horror and fear the same way we do. To me this just makes logical, common sense. But again, I can totally understand how someone can disagree. I, and the creators of this film, just ask those naysayers to remember, to look deep within ourselves, beyond their conditioning, that it is possible for humans to err when it comes to such belief systems. The Nazis are a good example - they treated Jews like animals. But honestly, the stuff in this documentary are the same - and far worse, in many cases - than what the Nazis did to the Jews. Nazis still had a relative modicum of respect and restraint for other humans compared to the way animals are treated by humans. If you disagree then you need to get a grip, and look at the images in this movie, and compare the number of Jews (in the millions) to the number of animals (in the billions). Let&apos;s be frank.\n\nThe truth is this documentary is not going to change those who are like the people depicted in the movie who are completely blind to what they&apos;re really doing. Many humans are beyond hope in that respect. But it will change those who are straddling the fence. It will give them the knowledge they prayed would never interrupt their meals. It&apos;s not a message. It&apos;s a reality. A grim, horrific, and terribly sad reality.",

And the really most important question: - How the hell are they going to animate the flying Romans?\n\nTo answer the last question: The special effects are really brilliant, every Asterix-fan will be delighted by the ways how the Romans leave ground. As well I really fell in love with the village.\n\nSome actors are really good. Most of all Roberto Benigni as the evil Destructivus is gorgeous. As well, I was positively surprised by Depardieu as Obelix. But Asterix is not as witty and humorous as in the books, Miracolix (alias Panoramix or Getafix) the druid is not the relaxed old wise.\n\nThe plot is new but has a lot of motives from the books. The real Asterix-fan will have noticed (I only know the German titles): Der Seher, der Kupferkessel, der Gallier, die Goten, als Legionaer, and there are surely more.\n\nAll in all I really much enjoyed the movie although I was really skeptic about it before. And I missed the pirates."

Perhaps I was expecting that those 2 worlds, or their separateness, would have been better defined from the beginning.\n\nThe whole project comes off like an amateur attempt judging by the lack of polish. The lighting is crap. The camera work is distracting. The casting is good. The dialogue is effective but the plot jumped around too much for me to follow. Makes me feel like I have A.D.D.\n\nThe technical flaws kept me out of the film and I was left with an overpowering sense of watching a film rather than experiencing it.",

Apart from the once in a while visuals, the movie has not been able to get even close to expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 &amp; 4, I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn&apos;t a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen. Milla Jovovich looks pretty as always, but that won&apos;t save the movie. All others have done a horrible job with their acting, especially Sienna Guillory. I would say that the only reason you would want to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the resident evil series and you don&apos;t mind wasting your money and time for the sake of this series.",

      "reviewBody": "The production company for this film calls itself &apos;Nott Entertainment&apos;, and that is a surprisingly apt name. This very is very &apos;Nott&apos; entertaining from start to finish, which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting. Every time a low budget zombie movie is released, it will tend to be &quot;for the fans by the fans&quot;. I do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but too many more like this one and I&apos;ll be re-evaluating my opinion! The film seems to be a rip-off of the half-decent Aussie zombie flick &apos;Undead&apos;, expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat; everyone is wearing one; but this doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times. The credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that we&apos;re going to be in for an atmospheric film, but when the movie starts properly; it soon becomes apparent what we&apos;re actually in for. Naturally, there&apos;s a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done, though the good things I have to say about the film pretty much end there. There&apos;s a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was. Overall, this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies. I don&apos;t recommend it.",

It works on many levels, all of which examine and ultimately show the futility of assimilation, given how unstable and unreliable is any governmental structure with which one attempts to identify.  Effort to assimilate across generations in Hungary becomes increasingly demanding as the lived world becomes ever more dehumanizing and brutal.  Fiennes has never been better in cross-generational roles, and others excellent as well. But a woman is the censor and conscience across time."

Still the movie is definitely a must see for people who like realistic, hard hitting films and not the loveyduvey smoochy films. Besides that aamir khan gives a brilliant performance as the confused brother trapped in underworld&apos;s tactics. Rani mukherjee is ok. Her voice is dubbed and one can clearly make out. Aamir Khan&apos;s aati kya khandala is a great highlight of the movie. The railway track race could have taken his life but he is still alive so have fun and watch this movie. This is an awesome film. My Rating 10/10",

There&apos;s some reasonable gore - the lecherous teacher getting dissected is the standout scene - plus some gratuitous nudity thrown in. The killer wears a cool mask but is let down by wearing yellow rubber gloves, the type you wash up with! The DVD case gave George Clooney star billing but that&apos;s a con, he&apos;s only a very minor character in the first 10 minutes.",

Despite a breezy location, a handful of reliable Euro actors and a reasonable general plot idea, this one suffers from poor direction and a fairly incomprehensible story. You&apos;ll be forgiven for getting lost in this one after a bit. Like Krimis in general, its fairly stylish while being more restrained than their Italian sister, the giallo. Its not bad but could have been better.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;At the Edge of the World&quot; is an unscripted, timeless, documentary window into an otherwise unseen, often harrowing, ongoing morality play on the frigid Ross Sea. What would you do? The director Dan Stone includes you as a member of the everyman and every-woman crew. Events unfold and tell the saga of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&apos;s two flimsy, non ice-burg rated ships. On a shoe string budget, the Farely Mowat and the Robert Hunter clash with the mighty Nisshin Maru and its supporting armada. At a million dollars a whale and a thousand butchered last year alone, all appropriate strategies and tactics are resourcefully applied to end the hunts.\n\nWith a self stylized Jolly Roger on the bow and a skeleton crew of 50, mostly volunteers from 15 countries and various expertise take on the odyssey. Seasoned and steady hand Sea Shepherd founder, Captain Paul Watson (co founder of Greenpeace and a former member) marshals his forces. Young archetypal fellow Captain Alex Cornelissen, the dedicated crew and on shore media contacts are not simply there to bear witness. Intervention between the so called research ship with harpoon at the ready and the whales swimming in the internationally recognized and protected, but until now unpatroled sanctuary, is the only course of action. This is a law enforcement organization and effort.\n\nHaving never an injury or death caused to either side, the crew of scruffy raiders fearlessly set out in zodiacs and use all manner of stink and smoke bombs and propeller foulers. Artfully executed precision maneuvers run interference and set up some metal grinding, ship to ship broad side contact caused by the whalers. The risks are unbelievable.\n\n&quot;At the Edge of the World&quot; is more than a simple anti-whaling documentary, it gets out of its own way. An eye opening, subtle, authentic and complete film, it stays with you long after you are on dry land. With its breath taking cinematography and jaw dropping footage, the film is about individual empowerment. The Sea Shepherd crew are the heroes in all of us. It is about what you can do (with regards to anything in life) or not. It&apos;s your choice. What will you do?",

      "description": "Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, millions refugees took the perilous escape across South China Sea to find freedom. Many died of drowning or starvation and thirst. Other lost at sea for days while some were pillaged, robbed and raped by pirates. However, more than 30 years after, no major film or television program tells their stories. Bolinao 52 is a long-silenced voice, an unspoken legacy of the Vietnam War - the story of the Vietnamese Boat People.\r\n\r\nWhen Tung Trinh, a survivor of the Bolinao 52, stepped foot onto a crowded boat one night in May 1988, she did not know it was a trip that forever changed her life. After leaving Vietnam the Bolinao 52 engine died. They were ignored by passing ships. 19 days later, a US Navy ship stopped. But the captain refused to pick up the dying refugees. Facing death, they resorted to cannibalism. After 37 days at sea, 52 of 110 survived. Two decades later, this Bolinao 52 survivor returned to her past to close off the unresolved chapters.",

      "reviewBody": "The reason I like these matinée westerns from this era is probably because they make me feel like a kid again but I have other reasons that I think are pretty good. For one thing they are utterly without pretense. They do not pretend to be anything but entertainment for kids and unpretentiousness is real hard to find. There may be some out there but if you look for it you will find that it doesn&apos;t grow on trees. And they&apos;re just fun. The female lead is always charming, and the horsemanship, these films are always loaded with extras that are real cowboys. Apparently the reduction of manpower needed on the large cattle ranches coincided with the rise of the film industry so all these unemployed cowboys went to Hollywood. And could they ride. They just tore around like a house on fire and the ease and control that they demonstrate with these horses is a wonder to watch for a tenderfoot like me. But the plots get a little monotonous, I think there&apos;s only about two of them or three, maybe. You have to kind of overlook that. Anyway Star Packer is no exception. What makes it stand out is for one thing it has George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes one of the greatest character actors ever. But the main thing is that it has one of my Hollywood favorites, Pendleton Round-Up Rodeo champion and pioneer stuntman Yakima Canutt. Now John Wayne made a lot of westerns in this era and Yakima Canutt was in every one of them as Wayne&apos;s stunt double. He was also in practically every one of the as one of them as one of the bad guys, usually the leader. What makes this movie special is that, as far as I know, this is the only time he ever appears as a good guy.He has a very entertaining part as John Wayne&apos;s Tonto-like side kick. This includes an extremely charming and hilarious final scene in which he completely enthralls Wayne&apos;s young son with his Indian dancing and attempts to corrupt him into becoming an Indian himself. This is much to the amusement of Wayne and his wife, Verna Hillie. I have noticed that a bunch of these John Waynes have been colorized. My brother won&apos;t look at them but I think that as long as I have access to the original, I like having them. The landscapes are particularly beautiful. It&apos;s the sound that&apos;s bad. They dub in new voices that are terrible. And the music, it&apos;s some kind of spaghetti western sounding stuff that has nothing with the charm of the era. View at your peril.",

I have to admit that I don&apos;t really enjoy video clip directing (except for Shinya Tsukamoto&apos;s amazing style) and this movie is THE MOVIE WITH A VIDEO CLIP DIRECTING, but, I have to admit, it&apos;s visually impressive! The really problem of this movie is this: it&apos;s visually impressive, but nothing more else...acting and dialogs are not sooooo bad (they aren&apos;t bad at all), you never have the impression to watch a bad film, but the whole screenplay is a bit weak...\n\nI have to say that is really hard to find horror/thriller movies like this in Italy nowadays, Infascelli is a director who wants to experiment (some sequences in H2Odio are really amazing if you like Digital Shots) so this work is important for Italian &quot;creepy movies&quot;, and for this reason I hope that Alex Infascelli will pay more attention on the substance in his next movies, &apos;cause a great cinematography and amazing camera movements makes an interesting movie, but not a masterpiece..\n\nAnyway, bravo Alex! and Chiara Conti confirms her as a talented actress...",

      "reviewBody": "Official launching of the film process developed by Fred Waller, a sort of more sophisticated version of Polyvision, the gimmick used by Abel Gance during the last minutes of his 1927 masterpiece &quot;Napoléon vu par Abel Gance&quot;, during Napoleon&apos;s Italian campaign. To each side of the screen were added simultaneous projections, mostly of independent images, each tinted with one of the two colors of the French flag. Waller&apos;s Cinerama was a more evolved system, since the images from three projectors formed a single set of action. The two lines dividing the three projections were always criticized, but it cannot be denied that it was a great spectacle. &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; is mainly a travelogue, starting with a roller-coaster ride to leave no doubt of the effect the system had on people when the camera moved. When it was static, there was no more difference from CinemaScope than size. Apart from the views of the United States, and Europeans locations, part of the film is integrated by pretensions of high art, like the boring section of Verdi&apos;s Aida. When somebody had the idea of &quot;adjusting&quot; the process to single-projection Cinerama, it faded quickly since the result was like any other wide-screen system on a huge screen. Films presented in single-projection Cinerama included, among others, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;It&apos;s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, &quot;Custer of the West&quot;, &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told,&quot; and &quot;Circus World&quot;, but I also saw standard anamorphic 35mm copies released in Panama&apos;s Cinerama Lux Theatre, of &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot;, &quot;55 Days in Peking&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;, &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, &quot;Rio Conchos&quot;, &quot;In Harm&apos;s Way,&quot; and many others.",

This educator befriends with an beautiful teacher (Tia Carrere) and an student (Mekhi Phifer), who wants an education. But this student has troubles with his previous gang members, especially with the leader (Guillermo Diaz). Who still wants him to sell drugs on the streets. This educator also has trouble with passionless principal (Oscar-Winner:Louise Fletcher) but he finds a way to teach his most unlikely students and giving them hope for education, which they never had before.\n\nDirected by Canadian actor:Hart Bochner (PCU) made an amusing comedy that spoofs films like &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and other memorable films. Lovitz is extremely likable and he has some very big laughs in this silly comedy. Although this comic spoof is unusually realistic at other moments also. The film has an good message for any students for those who wants an education and to have a bright future but it is also hard, what it&apos;s wants to be. Ambitious to be sure but always watchable. Written by David Zucker (Airplane!, Baseketball, Ruthless People), Robert LoCash (CB4:The Movie, Naked Gun 33 1/3:The Final Insult) and Pat Proof (Hot Shots 1 &amp; 2, Bachelor Party, Police Academy).

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m new to anime, in my 30&apos;s, recently watched the studio ghibli films and liked those quite a lot. So i&apos;m currently on a journey through decades of feature length anime films. Of the 60&apos;s anime Films i&apos;ve seen so far, I enjoyed this the most.\n\nVery ahead of its time in terms of style for an animated film. It feels more 80&apos;s than 60&apos;s and i watched a crude copy. Remastered it would look spectacular. I can&apos;t help but wonder how much of an influence this film had on the future of animation. It&apos;s early anime, but the style here is a very minimalistic one, slightly abstract, reminded me of Zelda: The Wind Waker.\n\nPretty random fantasy adventure but also very relaxing and a nice movie to put on at bedtime. The plot is largely sci fi driven as for the most part, this is a space exploration fantasy film. There are some interesting themes on robots gaining intelligence and fighting back against its creators. The gulliver element is the most confusing to me. I&apos;ve seen a few adaptation of gullivers travels, and this scientist as an old man gulliver as opposed to an original character didn&apos;t really seem to have much of a point. But i guess it all adds to the random charm.\n\nThe plot does meander a bit, but it&apos;s aesthetically pleasing and never boring. Sort of reminds me of The Little Prince.",

But it is more than that.\n\nI can still hear with my mind&apos;s ear (is that right?) the sound of the hydraulic press &quot;WHUMP&quot; and the echo. Then again that &quot;WHUMP&quot; ... is there another sound experience that reverberates through a movie like that?\n\nSure, surround sound, THX, all that tech stuff, but the sound as the manifestation of the crime that encircles this story, the horror as the mind tries to put together the images that (finally) is seen in a flashback as this scene bookends the start and &quot;finish&quot; of the plot.\n\nThe inner struggle of the scientist as he fights with his human hand to control the spasms of his &quot;fly&quot; arm is both horrible and heart-wrenching.\n\nThe shock as the cloth is torn away from the scientist&apos;s head... the fly&apos;s POV shot with facets and mirrors of the the screaming face of the scientist&apos;s poor wife! The scene at the spider&apos;s web as the shrill voice begs &quot;help me... help me&quot;\n\nThe horror of murder of a man/thing and a thing/man being shown and even compared in sharp (but obvious) dialogue.\n\nYou MUST see this and experience the earlier days of horror -when classics like this, like &quot;The Thing From Another World,&quot; like &quot;It, the Terror From Beyond Space&quot; (the original model of Alien) exhibit a freshness and a palpable terror that remakes cannot capture, whatever wonderful special effects are thrown in to add to the creepiness. Sure these later gorefest horror films are good. I buy them all the time. But they are a different genre. The Fly with Vincent Price is NOT the same story as The Fly with Jeff Goldblum. It&apos;s not really a remake as a retelling.\n\nSee the original. It is rich with emotion and intelligence, not to mention some pretty fine acting for what was really a &quot;B&quot; movie."

The transfer was low quality as the beginning credits were cut off since it was in &quot;pan and scan&quot; mode and not the &quot;letterbox&quot; mode usually used in the beginning to capture the full screen credits with the saloon style border.\n\nThe movie has all the classic Spaghetti-Western style and sound effects and out-of-sync voice dubbing that people love. It would be nice to see a new DVD transfer from the original film stock but there are no DVDs available although there are wide screen versions on the internet floating around.",

Unfortunately, it had to go up against Ben Hur for most awards. That doesn&apos;t take a bit from it&apos;s excellence and entertainment value.\n\nThis is an utterly fascinating story of a young nun (Audrey Hepburn), and a non-believing doctor (Peter Finch). Sister Luke (Hepburn) is constantly challenged in sticking to her vows, especially the one of obedience.\n\nShe chaffed at the rules that did not leave room for common sense. Is it better to strictly obey or to do more good in disobedience? It is a question asked over and over.\n\nThings become more difficult as WWII starts. Now, the rules must be set aside to help the war effort. Eventually, the conflict between the rules and her need for independence is resolved.\n\nHepburn was fantastic, as was Finch. Well worth seeing.",

Not only was the movie extremely predictable, but the acting was pathetic, the writing was pathetic, the directing was decent at best, all in all, this was just pathetic. There was absolutely no character development at all. There is no way that during the filming of this movie Heather Graham said to herself &quot;This is going to be a great movie!&quot; She was so unconvincing that it was almost comical. I seriously cannot think of one redeeming quality. This is the type of movie that you wait for to come out on DVD, and then don&apos;t rent it.",

Now while I admire the efforts that went into the making of this documentary I cannot enthuse over their choice of subject matter.\n\nMr Alonzo was a good, basic cameraman but not more than that. He was competent while not artistic, hard-working but not that interesting. Many cameramen of his generation went for easy gimmickry in their visuals instead of grounding their work in the best principles of motion picture photography. For example, placing yellow filters over the lens to suggest a 1940s (or historical) ambiance is something that many of these copycat DPs would do, but that isn&apos;t artistic cinematography. It is gimmickry. Often provided with photogenic background sets Mr Alonzo would light them not in the best interests of the story but merely to engage in display of visual pyrotechnics.\n\nThe producers of this documentary could have chosen so many more accomplished cinematographers as their subject. There are great names out there crying for a documentary like this: Robert Burks, Franz Planer, Robert Krasker, Arthur Miller, Joe August, Wilkie Cooper, Winton Hoch, Freddy Young, Osmond Borrodaile, Bert Glennon to name but a few. If we are going to try to encourage artistry in camera-work then we should be studying the artists.\n\nInteresting documentary, but they could have chosen a more worthy subject."

The films seems empty at times.. However, having said this, it is still a Roy Black picture with singing, honest emotions and good intentions. Boy meets girl, misunderstanding, separation, and then bliss, happiness.. A nice movie for a late Sunday afternoon in which you have nothing else to do and enjoy adolescent romantics and antics. Biederstaedt is fine actor but his role is limited, Peter Millowitsch is just playing himself. In 2008 still going strong in his own Kölnisch theater with folk-comedies. Not a good movie, bordering on darkish camp and therefore representative of the seventies. Times were not hopeful with the oil-crisis and rising unemployment.",

TCM...you&apos;re the best!\n\nIt was the restored version, thank the good Lord, with that sad reminder of Warner Brothers&apos; pathetic timidity in trashing Cukor&apos;s original cut, but recalling for us his masterful use of the widescreen ratio. (A &quot;formatted&quot; version would be simply unwatchable, what with numerous scenes played by actors perched on the outer reaches of the screen, opposite each other.)\n\nJames Mason turns in an absolutely brilliant performance, especially when one recalls the rigors of production, with filming going months over schedule, due to Judy&apos;s unhappy vicissitudes (so evident in her appearance even within the same scene!)  With the very able support of Charles Bickford, as the most benign studio head ever, and Jack Carson proving why Warners kept him employed so often for so many years.\n\nPlus musical direction taking fabulous advantage of Warners&apos; studio orchestra (and WB&apos;s sound technicians who were, for several decades running, the envy of all the other major studios), and arrangements that must have overwhelmed first-run audiences with their incredible richness.\n\nIt&apos;s a must-see, all right, and is in a class by itself, among the several screen versions of this beloved Hollywood saga."

The story was great, and it was really one of the best depictions of high schools idiots in the history of Hollywood. I mean, you did not see these guys taking tokes or drinking in their spare time, which really vexed some people. They&apos;re just stupid for the sake of the story. While the technical aspects weren&apos;t special, they worked when they needed it. This film also had one of the best music soundtracks in the history of Hollywood, even if it was from the 1980s. Too many good things to say about this film besides the fact it is a film which doesn&apos;t take itself seriously.",

      "reviewBody": "As I sat down, I wasn&apos;t expecting much even with the constant praise I read about this particular Norris effort. So to my surprise, I usually can&apos;t help but grin, or chuckle whenever watching one his films (humorous or not), but &quot;Code of Silence&quot; altered that perception. Well just say up until that waterlogged, lonesome gung-ho final curtain call into heroic pulp territory. Now then I couldn&apos;t help but raise a smirk, and go along with the fantasy. What really pushes this one along; is that it&apos;s professionally directed with balls and vigorous energy by Andrew Davis. The well-plotted material keeps you involved, while even following the standard textbook cop drama elements. The honest script has some cringe moments, but never becomes brainless. Just look at the witty humour and turmoil drama (a real concentration on loyalty from the cops to the criminals) that&apos;s thrown in, it fits along with everything that opens up in the meaty plot.\n\nSo it begs the question. How was our star? Norris&apos;s competently does a fine job. His easy-going nature, brought to the screen a comfortable performance, even when he wasn&apos;t kicking ass. And we know how good he&apos;s at the latter, but his acting turn here had a rather genuine feel to his character. Even though he&apos;s one man antics cross the line. He doesn&apos;t need a partner. Hell, just sack the entire police force as you can see by the results. Norris is capable enough. He got game. Henry Silva&apos;s stoically vicious drug lord villain, was a sturdy show-in and Molly Hagan admirably delivers. Ralph Foody amuses as a burnt-out cop.\n\nNothing about this project is award winning material, but assured catering in nearly every field makes it better than just your average cop drama. A confidently good-looking production, is filled with well-placed set-pieces and sweaty stunk work infused by its snappy pace and an uncannily, upbeat music score. The urban setting is put to great-use and fashionably-captured shots. \n\nQuite an exciting and always on the move action yarn, which has a little more thought behind it than you might think.",

      "reviewBody": "So, I saw FD5 at its midnight release after purchasing my tickets days in advance. Yes, I&apos;m that big of a fan; next to Nightmare on Elm Street, the FD franchise is my favorite. I don&apos;t want to make this a long review, but I will sum up my thoughts on this movie in one word AMAZING! FD 5 is, IMO, the best installment to the franchise, and in some cases, surpasses the original. From start to finish, the movie is full of suspense, tension, excitement, and anticipation. It&apos;s enough to keep ME, someone who has followed this movie&apos;s production for the past year and knew just about everything about the movie going into it, at the edge of my seat. Yes, I knew who&apos;d die, when they&apos;d die, and how they&apos;d die even before stepping foot into the theater. But, regardless, I wasn&apos;t let down one bit. This movie, unlike the others (minus the 1st), succeeded in giving character development. The death scenes were awesome and not too overly fictional, and even managed to throw in a new rule, &quot;kill or be killed.&quot; Which gave a breath of fresh air to the almost stale plot that we all know of. The premonition scene is definitely the best of the franchise and the acting was on par. Not Oscar worthy, but definitely believable for what it is. I just can&apos;t say enough how great this movie is. Now I won&apos;t spoil anything for anyone, but the ending was EPIC! Words can&apos;t describe how amazing it was. Steven Quale did wonders with the use of 3D as well. Should it be seen in 3D? YES! The film was shot in 3D and Quale knew when to emphasize the use of it without shoving it in our faces (except for the extra long title sequence, and credits). Anyways, while I loved this movie and everything about it, it did have a few things about it that underwhelmed me. The use of CGI blood was a bit more than I wanted, and at some points did look a bit fake. Also, some parts of the film were a bit too comedic. The comedic level should have been toned down for a particular scene (I&apos;m looking at YOU, Issac.) Other than that, the movie was fantastic and an excellent installment into the FD family. I really recommend this movie, but only to those at least knowing what they are getting themselves into."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;You know this story. The crackling lightning. The mad genius. An unholy creation.&quot;\n\nAnd so opens up the lastest interpretation of Mary Shelley&apos;s legendary novel-turned-pop culture myth. So, what does this version add to the time-tested tale? Surprisingly, a fair amount.\n\nAn amalgamation of various film versions (taking most of its cues from Universal and Hammer), this film tells the origins of Victor Frankenstein through the eyes of a nameless hunchback who, after a quick and very nasty surgery, is dubbed Igor. It tells the story of how the world around Victor reacts to his experiments, from the conniving entrepeuneur to the over-zealous man of faith trying to stop him. \n\nAnd how does it all hold up? Again, surprisingly really well. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy sparks the film up quite a few notches while Andrew Scott, Jessica Brown Findlay and Freddie Fox all make good work of their admittedly under-developed supporting roles.\n\nThe direction by Paul McGuigan is energetic and lively, even if the pace is a tad too frenetic at times. The use of practical effects for the monstrosities that our heroes bring to life are impressive to behold and everything is boasted by a powerfully theatrical score by Craig Armstrong and some beautiful production design by Eve Stewart. \n\nAs I said, pacing is a tad too fast and certain bits of writing could&apos;ve used some tweaking, but the cast and enthusiastic direction definitely make this a more than worthy entry into the Frankenstein mythos that I will gladly welcome into my collection as soon as it makes its to Blu-Ray/DVD.\n\nI&apos;m pleased to say that it is very much alive.",

      "reviewBody": "I was quite bored for the first 25-30 minutes of this film, which is tedious in establishing its main character, shot in a neorealist style that overly elongates everyday activities (e.g. church services), and has dry philosophical discussions on the various opinions of Blaise Pascal. However, when a serious young Catholic named Jean-Louis (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is invited to join an old friend Vidal (Antoine Vitez) and his girlfriend Maud (Françoise Fabian) and the conversation turns to relationships, things improve, and it grew on me. It wrestles with the theme of balancing religious and moral convictions with the temptations of the flesh, as well as the decisions we make in life while selecting a partner.\n\nThere is a refreshing lightness and maturity to the way in which these characters (and perhaps the French in general) treat love affairs. They are spoken of as anything else in life, there is understanding when someone wants to move on, and when a woman says &apos;no&apos;, it&apos;s respected, without further pursuit. Vidal leaves Jean-Louis alone with Maud for the night, knowing there is an attraction between the two, and it&apos;s interesting to listen to them talk about their views while she lightly flirts with him. In his view, she has two strikes against her - one physical (she&apos;s not a blonde, his preference), and one spiritual (she&apos;s not a Catholic). On the other hand, it&apos;s because there seems to be no chance of a relationship that they seem so happy and natural together. Their scene later in the snow is fantastic. Unfortunately, he&apos;s already become attached to another woman he&apos;s seen in church (Marie-Christine Barrault), who, while blonde and Catholic, seems less interesting and less sensuous, setting up an interesting choice for him. \n\nIt&apos;s telling to me that despite his earnestness and apparent honesty, he tells each of them early on that he feels he&apos;s known her for ages. There is something devastatingly honest about hearing that, as we no doubt repeat ourselves in different relationships, and it can be read as being disingenuous, or as commentary that we can connect with many different people in life, and tend to do so, so that our final partner is somewhat arbitrary, even if influenced by certain principles. \n\nWhile parts of the film were slow and I wish the philosophical discussions hadn&apos;t been so specific to Pascal and Jansenism, I liked the intelligent, meaningful conversations these characters have. I also liked the street footage in the wintertime, during the Christmas holidays, which is clearly real and adds to the film&apos;s aesthetic. Françoise Fabian lights up the screen in her scenes, and plays the most interesting character, one I empathized with (divorced, single mom) and related to (more down to earth, and what I would call a spiritual atheist). The ending scene makes us both wistful and accepting at the same time. It&apos;s not a perfect film, or even one I would recommend without at least some reservations, but at the end I found I had liked it.",

Houdin tried to present his theory to the then old guard of Egyptologists who mostly, according to the documentary, didn&apos;t give Houdin the time of day. All save for one who is a trusted member of Egypt&apos;s inner circle, who was willing to listen and entertain Houdin&apos;s theory, and, though intrigued, was not entirely convinced, but was willing to listen to Houdin and weigh the evidence against the theory.\n\nThe evidence is not compelling in the sense that it suddenly clears up a lot of mysteries with one fantastic explanation, but the theory does fall in place with a lot of unexplained facets of the pyramids; the &quot;main gallery&quot;, rooms at the corners of the pyramids, and a few other details regarding stress and what stones went where.\n\nI like this documentary because in the past other documentaries, particularly those produced by American or UK production companies, tend to add a lot of production gloss like music and artistic shots to help make the piece look interesting, and where Florence Tran adds a few clearly staged shots showing Houdin first meeting and talking with various people, the film pretty much stays with the basic idea of how the pyramids were built.\n\nAll I can is, well, now we know how, all thanks to Houdin and his father. Have a look and enjoy.\n\nIt&apos;s a good watch."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Tenue de Soirée&quot; was a project that germinated after more than ten years of dormancy in Bertrand Blier&apos;s mind. His breakthrough &quot;Les Valseuses&quot; starring Gérard Depardieu, Patrick Deweare and Miou-Miou in a most peculiar &apos;menage à trois&apos; broke several grounds of sexual representation in France and its commercial success encouraged him to make not a sequel but a companion piece with the same actors. Having noticed the naughty playfulness of buddies Gérard and Patrick, he asked them if they were game for a movie where they would be homosexuals. They were.\n\nUnfortunately, Dewaere who had more than one demon to overcome left cinema in 1982 and so &quot;Tenue de Soirée&quot; feature two thirds of the trio, Yet the addition of Michel Blanc is a masterstroke of replacement for something in Dewaere&apos;s physicality would have made difficult to exude the sad vulnerability of Blanc. Indeed the diminutive bald mustachioed man, since his early success with the &apos;Splendid Troop&quot;; got almost typecast as lovable nobodies for which his Jean-Claude Dusse was the flag bearer.\n\nBut if Blier could make sensitive souls out of killers like in &quot;Buffet Froid&quot; surely poor schmucks like Antoine would be treated with more respect. And so we&apos;re in a little old-fashioned party hall, a band starts playing and obviously Monique (Miou-Miou) was waiting for the music to be loud enough to cover quite an ego-crushing &quot;reasons you suck&quot; speech to her husband. She&apos;s tired of leaving a miserable life with a loser, she wants the fairy tale, a house and despises a man who can&apos;t be a provider... a submissive Antoine looks as he&apos;s twice grieving the relationship and a certain ideal of masculinity he will never belong to.\n\nBut then something happens, her nagging is cut short by a violent slap from Bob (Gérard Depardieu) who had eavesdropped the whole monologue. Today, such a scene would pass as misogynistic and earn a film torrents of protests against what seems to be endorsement of men&apos;s brutality ... but that would be a false trial. According to Blier, film that was a huge commercial success (with its infamous tag-line) didn&apos;t create much turmoil and met with a very warm welcome from the gay press in the 80s and no cries whatsoever from feminists. So why such a brutal moment was relevant in the film&apos;s context? Is Bob giving Monique a taste of her own medicine, reminding her the kind of action an alpha male is capable to?\n\nI have another theory. Watching Antoine being castrated alive because he doesn&apos;t have the makings of a man&apos;s man, he doesn&apos;t just slap her but buys her silence with more money than she ever got from Antoine. I often fantasized of being rich enough to throw as many bills to my partner so she could stop whining, it&apos;s a totally infantile mindset but it&apos;s got a point: every man has a breaking point, it&apos;s possible that every woman&apos;s got a price where you can buy the right to be a prick if you&apos;re rich enough to fulfill her demands. I&apos;m not inserting these thoughts on Blier but I&apos;m positively surprised that a film could materialize in one scene an obsessive question.\n\nAnd when Antoine retaliates and threatens to knife Bob, Bob shows his torso and dares him to act... before telling him to sit down and give him money as well. Bob isn&apos;t a troll, much less a macho, he&apos;s a quirky human being who took an instant liking on Antoine as a man, and as a woman behind the man. What does Bob do for a living? He&apos;s a professional burglar... Blier always had a fondness for marginals and outlaws...and I suspect it&apos;s because there&apos;s much more potential for betrayals and dirty tricks to spice up a plot. But again, Depardieu is the flamboyant, poetic and exuberant yin to Antoine&apos;s passive and sensitive yang. In fact, he&apos;s such a larger-than-life character that he encompasses both Antoine and Monique&apos;s needs.\n\nMonique finds in Bob the role she wanted Antoine to play. Each man couldn&apos;t satisfy her alone alone but the two formed the right male ideal. But to keep Monique, Antoine must surrender to Bob&apos;s pleas and sacrifice his pride. It&apos;s my ass, he says, rightfully so... but you&apos;ve got to love the totally unforced and almost smooth way Antoine finally lets thing go. In any clunky screenplay, like the horrendous &quot;French Twist&quot;, Antoine would have immediately switched to bisexuality but Blier is a more nuanced filmmaker and his way with words proves again to be effective, even more through the maestria of Depardieu.\n\nBob delivers what might be one of most tender declarations. Wishing to turn Antoine&apos;s shame to happiness, asking him if he hasn&apos;t ever dreamed of snuggling up in a sturdy body. Antoine&apos;s moved reaction is the first awakening of his feminine side. Has Monique ever been that nice to him? And so Bob commits the greatest burglary of his life... one the film doesn&apos;t linger on but doesn&apos;t sugarcoat either. Unlike the &quot;Birdcage&quot;, the film doesn&apos;t turn homosexuality into derision but into a a certain idea that life is so tough for men that their tragedy is that they can&apos;t be womanly enough to hide their fears or insecurities with a stronger figure. In one of the film&apos;s most inspired scenes, after a brief disappearance of Monique tired of being treated like a maid, it&apos;s Antoine&apos;s turn to be the nagging one, complaining to a Bob who doesn&apos;t take care of him.\n\nFar ahead of its time, &quot;Tenue de Soirée&quot; is the study of a certain need for domination and affection that transcends the gender barriers, how roles can easily be switched if opportunity knocked, maybe all men secretly wishes that... there&apos;s something irreverential, disturbing, but so truthful that even the final scenes doesn&apos;t feel like a cheap shot at laughs, but a logical conclusion with three people who found some balance and three actors with terrific chemistry... paraphrasing its tagline, truly a freakin&apos; film!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is really a little gem. I need a little effort to defend this argument. It&apos;s enough to remember that it is directed by Mario Monicelli, the GREAT director (La Grande Guerra, I soliti Ignoti, Guardie e Ladri, L&apos;Armata Brancaleone and many others), and that it won seven David di Donatello, an important Italian movie award, including best movie and best director.\n\nThe cast is also incredible, as it groups together so many European icons: from Sweden Liv Ullman (the protagonist of many Ingmar Bergman movies); from France, the beautiful Catherine Deneuve, and the wonderful actors Philippe Noiret and Bernard Blier; from Italy the divine Stefania Sandrelli, always beautiful and realistic, and the already very very good actress Athina Cenci.\n\nAfter the cynic &quot;Parenti serpenti&quot;, Monicelli again films a portrait of another Italian family. There is not a real protagonist in this movie, the protagonist is the family. There is a lot of fun, but also some thoughtful moments, as always in Monicelli&apos;s movies. All the males in this movie end up revealing their egoistic nature or stupidity. A concept that the Italian Comedy of 50s and 60s (which Monicelli belonged to) already expressed and elaborated extensively. The difference here is that there is hope, and this hope resides in women.\n\nI don&apos;t want to say that this is a movie just for women. It&apos;s fun, it&apos;s serious, and it does a very nice homage to women and sisterhood.\n\nI say don&apos;t miss this movie, males and females, I am sure you won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "The DVD package says this is &quot;a sly &amp; smart comedy&quot;, but I have to warn you, that&apos;s not exactly what you get. To me, a sly &amp; smart comedy would be &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; or &quot;Deathtrap&quot; or even &quot;Fargo&quot;. While this movie has the same bizarre, criminal elements and intelligent dialogue as the above, I never sensed any outright comedy.\n\nStill, it&apos;s well done &amp; definitely worth a watch. Rather than a comedy, I would describe it more as a &quot;drama of errors&quot;. The subject of murder is actually handled quite seriously although its casual nature might come across as odd (hence the humour?). There are no real laughs, but the strangeness of the story might elicit a few snorts, chortles, and possibly even a harrumph. But no guffaws.\n\nThe acting is excellent, the script is good, the style &amp; direction is smooth &amp; suave, like the 1940s setting it depicts. Some might consider it slow, but I&apos;d say that&apos;s a plus because it gives us time to digest the complex themes that are presented such as the incompatible definitions of &apos;love&apos;, the value of loyalty in marriage as well as friendship, and of course the morality of murder.\n\nOverall I liked this film. It&apos;s just the dag blasted ending that left me feeling cheated. I won&apos;t talk about it except to say that you should watch the alternate endings included on the DVD instead. In particular, Alternate #1 is closer to the book, and it gives us the thematic closure that the theatrical version omits. Alternate ending #1 also has a great piece of acting by Pierce Brosnan which, if it were in the actual movie, would&apos;ve definitely made me bump up my rating by 1 or 2 stars.\n\n&quot;Married Life&quot; is definitely worth the $2 rental fee. It deviates from the book on several key elements (such as the ending) and as a result doesn&apos;t quite wrap things up convincingly. But as far as movies go, it&apos;s entertaining, engaging and showcases some great acting talents.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Rumpelstiltskin&apos; may be a fairly slight story that doesn&apos;t really lend itself well to a feature film (the most being a half an hour episode of a series of of fairy tale adaptations), but it does have an unforgettable titular character (one of the most memorable in all literature), an interesting conflict and personally have always gotten out of it a valuable and important message of greed.\n\nDEFA distributed a number of fairy tale adaptations from East Germany, some are better than others but they do intrigue. Mainly for seeing older versions of these stories and some have some very interesting differences to the original stories. All are worth a look, if some more for curiosity and completest sake. The 1955 version of &apos;Rumpelstiltskin&apos; is one of those. It has notable and interesting changes, namely a different take on Rumpelstiltskin himself, with him being an intended more sympathetic interpretation rather than the nasty one of the Grimm story, its larger cast of characters (on top of the original characters, there are major and minor additions with extras acting as go-betweens) and the heavy economic theme.\n\nYet for all those interest points, this &apos;Rumpelstiltskin&apos; disappointed me. Appreciated that it aimed to be different and it is far from trash or unwatchable, but found it lacking in a lot of areas.\n\nWill say that there are good points. The sets are simple and sparsely detailed, but are cleverly used and are still not hard on the eyes. The costumes are more interesting and are very colourful, the best thing about the film visually, and it&apos;s all complemented beautifully by the photography, one of the better-photographed DEFA fairy tale films, and lighting, the latter of which actually making the sets more interesting than they are. The incidental music, while not sticking in the head a long while after, is a pleasant listen. Karin Lesch is charming as Marie.\n\nDid really appreciate the character development to Marie and the King. Marie is not someone potentially passive, though always actually rootable in the original story, but learns to be more assertive. Can myself learn from doing that, being someone who gets easily stressed and struggles to be assertive. The king is also not as greedy, with him learning to put his family first. Appreciation too is had for what the film has to say about greed and how money corrupts, very truthful and very relevant today.\n\nDespite the more intended sympathetic interpretation of Rumpelstiltskin, this doesn&apos;t really come off successfully. It just doesn&apos;t gel with his grotesque appearance and comes over as annoying and at times too creepy, Siegfried Seibt does admirably but overplays at times. This version of &apos;Rumpelstiltskin&apos; can be too stagy, feeling like a filmed play or something and never feeling opened up, and suffers from the original story lending itself much better to a shorter length, evident in the over-stretched pacing and that it somehow feels padded. This is including the decision to broaden the cast and number of characters, as intriguing as it was they merely distracted and didn&apos;t add very much.\n\nIts handling of the message/theme can come over as heavy-handed and obvious and the dialogue doesn&apos;t flow very well. The direction has competence but is undistinguished.\n\nSummarising, don&apos;t consider &apos;Rumpelstiltskin&apos; a good film but it did serve as an interesting take on the story which is hugely appreciated, despite the differences mostly failing. 5/10",

Their story was hidden by the French authorities after the war since their heroism could not be attributed to the &quot;French French&quot;. They lived the rest of their quiet lives in complete obscurity; only brought to attention by the discovery of a Nazi Era poster condemning &quot;foreign elements&quot; in the French resistence.\n\nThe irony of the rescue from obscurity of these quiet heros by a Nazi condemnation is bitter, but the film, lovingly made and respectfully presented is a great tribute to these great men.\n\nThis film brings both the history and the personal lives of these men to life, and teaches us all a lesson in political expediency that is difficult to forget."

      "reviewBody": "The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 (1985) was a unwarranted sequel. But after all this was the eighties and sequels were in vogue. The first film had a fine closure and I still don&apos;t understand what was Wes Craven thinking when he released it? It was far too tamed to be an R-Rated film and it wasn&apos;t a true sequel (in my opinion). Too far fetched and inane. I wasn&apos;t pleased with the end results. I&apos;ll just pretend it never took place.\n\nNot a bad movie but certainly not a good one either. A mediocre effort of Wes Craven. You could tell his heart wasn&apos;t in this project. But I would take one of these films any day compared ti the rubbish he&apos;s cranking out these day.\n\nAn okay time waster. Not a total disaster that some people might make you believe it is!",

They carried right on, however, with their characteristically stiff English upper lip, come what may. Great film with a knockout ending.",

Solid supporting performances by Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl round out a great film that ranks among my personal favorites.\n\nBridges portrays an arrogant radio shock-jock, who&apos;s big mouth and flippant comments send a disturbed listener on a murderous rampage, thus ending his career.  Enter Ruehl as his new enabler girlfriend, waiting patiently for him to drag himself up from the dregs, hoping to catch a ride to the top. Just when Bridges seems to have hit rock bottom, he encounters Williams, a crazed vagrant who thinks he is a knight in shining armor.\n\nWhat ensues is a tale of remorse, redemption and rebirth which is made all the more magical by Gilliam&apos;s magnificent vision.  Most notable is a scene which takes place in Grand Central Station where the hustle and bustle of the busy commuters dissolves into a spectacular waltz as Williams follows Plummer, the woman of his dreams.  Gilliam&apos;s style makes Williams delusions come alive as the character makes the slow journey from trauma-induced insanity to stark, yet hopeful, reality.  \n\nEvery character in this film undergoes a metamorphosis, each learning from the others along the transformation.  It is a beautiful film to watch, and an achievement to all involved that subject matter of such depth can come across with such humor and with such beauty.",

It&apos;s an OK watch if you are feeling lazy, because if you approach the piece with all your wits about you you&apos;ll probably quickly spot the flaws in various plans being laid, and thus spoil the fun. Definitely a convoluted tale, though not entirely unpredictable, and certainly it has a moment or two of originality as far as stories like this go. My real problem is that overall the movie sends a mixed message, especially in regard to justice versus karma. I liked some of the music and the way it synced with the story, and if there was tension, then it was in taking odds on the ending, which had a surprise roundness to it. I liked the film myself, and certainly parts were brave, but I&apos;m also glad that it was made in 2006 and not today.",

However, even the best cinematography can&apos;t save a film from truly bad acting, a horrible script, poor directing and sloppy editing.\n\nThe only good acting I saw in this movie came from F. Murray Abraham. All the rest were... well, not even good amateurs. They seemed to have no training or experience in acting at all. Their characters were entirely unbelievable.\n\nI&apos;m not the least bit surprised to see that this flick lost money. Someone should do us all a favor and lose all the prints, copies, DVDs, etc. Don&apos;t waste any portion of your life on this movie -- find something, anything else to watch."

The duration is short and the film is song less, which the filmmakers rarely dared to for the Indian masses. The film has an intermediate pace yet grips you. It&apos;s a taut thriller but not with much of the twists and surprises. The film moreover feels a Hrishikesh Mukherjee drama for the human emotions it delves into. Apart few stereotypical roles the film has, the freshness is offered through an impeccable performance of Vinod Khanna, perhaps in one of his better roles of his early years. Overall, it&apos;s a kind of a film you will wish to watch again for the sensitivity with which the subject is handled with.\n\nRating: 2.5 stars out of 4.",

      "reviewBody": "Almost Famous (2000) \n\n**** (out of 4)\n\nCameron Crowe&apos;s masterpiece about high schooler William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who gets a job with Rolling Stone to do a story on an upcoming band named Stillwater. The young and naive kid gets to go out on the road with them where he quickly grows up and sees that the world isn&apos;t always perfect. ALMOST FAMOUS is one of the greatest coming of age movies ever made and it&apos;s perhaps the greatest love story to rock &apos;n roll ever filmed. I think a strong argument could also be made that it&apos;s the greatest film of the decade as well. There&apos;s so much love and passion during every single scene that you can&apos;t help but see and feel that this is Crowe&apos;s baby and it&apos;s easy to see why since much of this is based on his life growing up. This film contains so many terrific moments but I think what makes it so special are the various relationships that are built on the road. This includes William trying to mix it up with the band&apos;s guitar player (Billy Crudup) who refuses to give him an interview as well as the girl (Kate Hudson) that both of them love for different reasons. The overly worried mother (Frances McDormand) is perfectly written and thrown into the story for some comic relief but even the smaller characters are so well-written and detailed that by the time the movie is over it&apos;s almost like you&apos;ve seen a documentary of a real band. Crowe&apos;s direction has never been better as this film has quite a bit of different emotions going for it yet he perfectly holds it together and really makes the film take off to levels one wouldn&apos;t expect. As a fan of rock and roll you have to love the behind-the-scenes look at a tour and the various problems that come from the sex and drugs. You also have to have fun and admire this young kid being able to go out on the road as this would be an ultimate dream job for many. The film mixes in some terrific music but the highlight is of course &apos;Tiny Dancer&apos; from Elton John, which is without question one of the best and most magical scenes from any movie. The performances are all a major plus from the bigger acts to the smaller roles. Everyone fits their roles perfectly and help bring the story to life. ALMOST FAMOUS is a flawless picture that just keeps getting better with each new viewing. Some say the film is too soft and should have attacked the music harder or been more raw but I really disagree with these comments. The film is a love story to the music and one of the greatest out there."

This is about a pack of old hams who know they&apos;re hams: they play to the camera, they &apos;find their lights&apos; like old pros. There&apos;s a pecking order in the place, from the lowly chorus member sculling soup (&quot;the chorus is the most important part of the opera company&quot;, she opines) right up to the near-star Sara Scuderi.\n\nThese people all have music and performing in their blood; it&apos;s a total part of their identities. Somehow it&apos;s a wonderful demonstration of how music gets under the skin of its performers, and never leaves them, even when the ability to perform it diminishes.\n\nIn the opera, &quot;Tosca&apos;s Kiss&quot; is the kiss of death; but this is a film about living.",

It&apos;s a remake of an old French classic, &quot;Bob La Flambeur&quot; (which I haven&apos;t seen yet... so I may have a different take on this movie after I&apos;ve seen the original).  The cast (various character actors of different nationalities) is great... and Nolte portrays a very believable down-on-his-luck substance-abuser... but that may not be much of a stretch for him.  Directed and written by Neil Jordan... it may not be one of his best movies (&quot;The Crying Game&quot;, &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;) but it&apos;s still a fine piece of work.",

When gruesome incidents occur there again and again, Martin gets involved in a bloody criminal case about a brutally murdering serial killer who has it in for pretty young women. Horror, crime, thriller and, not to be guessed from the description so far, humour as well. With his debut film, Danish director Ole Bornedal succeeded in creating a gripping, atmospherically dense thriller with many shocker elements. The viewer can place himself exactly in the eerie world around the protogonist and is constantly led on false trails. Besides holding your breath a few times, the work impresses with a strong pinch of black humour. There is also nothing to complain about in terms of acting, especially Kim Bodnia can put herself in the limelight brilliantly, as always. Perhaps the visuals of the film are not quite &quot;glossy&quot;, but you can see from the remake 3 years later that this is not the decisive essence of a good scary thriller. Definitely a small genre pearl.",

      "reviewBody": "Refreshing blend of supernatural mystery and superhero movies. One review here I read seemed to think less of the movie because it didn&apos;t follow the familiar formula of an angst-ridden young hero with lots of problems; an emo kid who is hated by all and longs for a girl he can never have. The same old tired Spider-Man knock-off stuff, in other words. I, for one, enjoyed the freshness of this movie. Here we have a character who deals not only with having a supernatural gift but also deals with death daily. He sees things no one should see. In 99.9% of stories written about anything even in this ballpark, the lead character would be wracked with self-pity and guilt, would have no stable relationships, and would have no sense of humor unless it was dipped in bitterness. He would also seldom bathe.\n\nBy contrast, Odd Thomas is a likable popular guy with a beautiful, understanding girlfriend, a friendly relationship with a sympathetic police captain, and a healthy attitude about doing good things with his gift. Anton Yelchin as Odd and Addison Timlin as his girlfriend Stormy are perfectly cast. They have sparkling chemistry and the loving banter between the two of them is the movie&apos;s strongest point. Willem Dafoe plays slightly against type as the fatherly police captain but it&apos;s a great fit for him. The stunning Gugu Mbatha-Raw has a small but important role as a friend of Odd &amp; Stormy&apos;s.\n\nThe writing is crisp with some fun dialogue. The characters are written and acted well. The movie moves at a good pace and never leaves you bored. My only criticisms would be some slightly obvious plot twists, especially where one villain is concerned, and a mildly dissatisfying ending. Still, it&apos;s an enjoyable movie with a little bit of action and effects that is driven by character. It&apos;s miles above any of the other young adult-oriented sci-fi/supernatural movies I&apos;ve seen in recent years.",

In 2004, he buys an old glass house in a lake, designed and built by his father, and he finds a message in his mailbox from the former tenant, the also lonely Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), asking to deliver her correspondence in an address downtown. Alex meets his brother Henry (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) in Chicago and when they go to the address with Dr. Forster&apos;s correspondence, they find a building of luxury apartments under construction to be delivered eighteen months later. After some messages, Alex and Kate disclose that she is living in 2006 and Alex in 2004, they fall in love for each other and they try to find means to meet each other.\n\n&quot;The Lake House&quot; is a beautiful and magical tale of impossible love, with a wonderful chemistry between the gorgeous Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The story has many flaws and lack of explanations, and slightly recalls the idea of the excellent &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, but better off forget the inconsistencies and enjoy the nice love story. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Casa no Lago&quot; (&quot;The House in the Lake&quot;)",

(Can&apos;t really fault him for that.., but I digress) So our &quot;hero&quot;, finds a magical way to &quot;become&quot; whoever the lucky devil is who is &quot;with&quot; Juli Ashton. By with, I mean in the &quot;biblical sense&quot;.\n\nI rated this a 9 out of 10, for one reason only. The sweet Juli Ashton performs in a DP scene, and I personally don&apos;t care to see her &quot;poked &amp; prodded&quot; AND &quot;stretched&quot; in such a profane way. But kudos to you Juli. I look forward to seeing more of your movies.",

      "name": "&apos;The Strangers&apos; are a little TOO scary...",
      "reviewBody": "We all know the plot: young couple, isolated vacation home, people in masks. Yet from the start of &apos;The Strangers&apos; it&apos;s clear that this film is a different. In today&apos;s bloodthirsty society, horror films are often reduced to nothing more than gore-filled gross-out fests. While many young teens may rejoice at such films, many of us still long for original, suspenseful, and, yes, terrifying horror movies. &apos;The Strangers&apos; came so close.\n\nThere is plenty here to recommend: Director Bryan Bertino shows himself to be a patient and smart director. Rather than going for just cheap thrills, he wisely builds tension up to near-breaking point. The feeling of suspense and dread that covers the whole film is classic. Both Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman do well in their leading roles, and the strangers themselves are things of pure terror... yet that&apos;s where the film loses some of its commendation. The strangers at times seem that they can&apos;t possibly be human because they are made to be almost supernatural in their abilities. They appear and disappear seemingly at will and instantly- a power the young couple probably wished they had but don&apos;t because they are, after all, HUMANS. It&apos;s a simple mistake used to give the audience one of those cheap thrills that were otherwise so wisely avoided. What makes it sad is that in every other aspect, &apos;The Strangers&apos; is chillingly realistic and terrifyingly possible. Every time those strangers come and go like ghosts of some kind, it makes the audience sit back once more and say, &apos;Ah, well, it&apos;s just a movie.&quot; That&apos;s too bad.\n\nStill, &apos;The Strangers&apos; is much better than your average horror fare. It&apos;s at last a new movie that realizes what you don&apos;t show can be even more scary than what you do. Still, one hopes that Mr. Bertino can touch up the mistakes from this film and , and deliver a really great horror movie next time around. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",

      "reviewBody": "Riccardo Freda, an Italian director of skill who directed many Sword and Sandal films of the 60&apos;s as well as horror greats like I Vampiri, does a very serviceable job directing this thoughtful, mood-laden sequel of sorts to his earlier effort The Horrible Doctor Hitchcok. One does not need to have seen that earlier effort to follow what goes on here as they are really entities unto themselves with the same characters just going through different circumstances and having different motivations. In this film Dr. Hitchcock(living in Scotland - very implausible given the Mediterranean looks of most of the cast) is bound in a wheelchair and has nothing but sickly pity for himself as he wishes to die. Helping him remain alive is a local doctor giving him some sort of concoction to live and, of course, no love triangle would be complete without the love object of the other two sides - sultry, hypnotic breathless Barbara Steele - the 60&apos;s queen of the horror film - particularly the Gothic horror film. Steele is not a great actress by any stretch. She is lovely to look at and has the most impressive pair of - yes, I know where I could go here but really I intended to say eyes the entire time. Freda creates a slowly building tension between the central characters and the story is nothing exceptional in terms of creativity. You have seen this story before in various adaptations. Freda does; however, have a flair with the camera lens, and I was really surprised at how well he, the actors, and the story all combined to make an interesting film experience. The rest of the cast is all serviceable with Elio Jotta as Dr. Hitchcock being particularly effective and Harriet Medin(who was in the previous Hitchcock film also as a maid) doing a nice, creepy job as Catherine the housemaid. There are some very powerfully shot scenes: the tomb scene is genuinely eerie and the final denouement is quite good. Loads of atmosphere make this one of the best of its kind.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;A Royal Affair&quot; is a Danish/Swedish/Czech production about the reign of 18th century King Christian VII of Denmark, his Welsh wife and a German physician whose progressive ideas shake Denmark&apos;s conservative ruling class to its foundations. As best I can discern the film tries to keep true to actual history with some embellishments added concerning the role of the Queen in the political machinations along with some reasonable speculation about a possible menage a trois. The screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg does a nice job of capturing the unusual atmosphere of life at a court governed by a mentally unstable monarch who&apos;s little more than a nuisance puppet of the nobility and the church. In the middle of all that is the young English Queen trapped in a loveless marriage. She is also disturbed by the unwillingness of her adopted country to accept the ideas of the Enlightenment then circulating around Europe. Under the direction of Nikolaj Arcel &quot;A Royal Affair&quot; is an effective recreation of a bygone age yet one in which we can see our contemporary quagmire between those who advocate change and those condemning it. Mikkel Folsgaard is excellent as the King. He never descends to caricature and is both powerful and pitiable. Mads Mikkelsen is compelling as Dr. Johann Struensee a noble but flawed man given a rare opportunity to improve the lot of the lower classes who are suspicious of him as a foreigner usurping the state. Alicia Vikander is Caroline Mathilde a Welsh princess sent to Denmark in an arranged marriage of noble households with no idea of what&apos;s in store for her. This is very good intelligent costume drama that should please fans of the genre. Well worth seeing.",

Even at the family&apos;s lowest ebb, when the alternative of living in a cramped council flat is seriously mooted, The Mother can say, at least you live in the country.\n\n  But WILL IT SNOW FOR CHRISTMAS is no unthinking pastoral of blazing sun, beautiful countryside, and hearty rustics.  In a world where the neverending sun is a dangerous, oppressive glare, where the land is a bleak, uniform, thoroughly mastered mistress demanding constant attention, where the locals are mean-minded, avaricious bigots, this is pastoral as Bresson might have made it, beating down on its characters, loveless, thankless, relentless.\n\nThe image of wholeness and harmony that opens the film, though hard, is deeply schismatic.  As they are constantly reminded, the children are the illegitimate offspring of The Father who houses them in a seemingly pleasant farmhouse, with no sanitary or heating amenities, while he exploits them as cheap labour with his two older, &apos;legitimate&apos; sons, living with his own family who are ashamed of the &apos;b-----ds&apos;.  Initially, he seems tough but fair, a loving father, but as the film wears on, the extent of his cruelty becomes apparent, never melodramatised, rooted in the rural French values of land, greed, sexual desperation and exploitation.\n\nCHRISTMAS is rare in showing a world of work.  When you think about it, it&apos;s strange how something so completely fundamental to our lives, our identities, our social, economic and political relations is so absent from our films.  With the hardly typical exception of policemen, the world of work only acts as a handy character signifier, or, at most, a setting for plot.  But it&apos;s never simply represented as itself.  \n\nHere we get lingering sequences of pure work, and we see its truth, how, for most of us, its thoughtless repetition deadens us, mechanises us, makes us mere animals, brooding and resentful, ready to lash out at whoever we feel is to blame for it, leaving you so tired you can&apos;t even read at night.  The film is not entirely successful here - my dad came from blighted farming background, and his grim experiences don&apos;t really find any correspondances here.  But work is an extraordinary revealer of character, and in a film full of quiet, insightful observations of The Mother, a woman of so much love she is in danger of losing it, the most powerful is related to work, after she&apos;s discovered The Father has made a pass at her daughter - she sits alone, bowed, under a purple twilight, beside a truck of randomly strewn fruit crates.\n\nSo the images of wholeness and authenticity we idealistically associate with the countryside are actually riven with schism.  The film describes two worlds - that dominated by The Father, one of virtual slavery (the casting of Daniel Duval, director of LA DEROBADE, an exploitative study of female degradation, is surely no accident), grind, abuse, as inexorable as the seasons; and the indoor world of the family, privileged, remarkably, considering things, still full of love and optimism.  \n\nThere are brief moments of epiphany throughout, when the relentless &apos;realistic&apos; visual register is suspended by something more subjective, a space untouched by Father and work.  This culminates in the magical Christmas climax, as we see, framed in the darkness, behind a small barred window, an ambiguous image of family: on the one level cramped, imprisoned, shrouded, isolated; on the other harmonious, loving, a source of light and communication, a world of dream and stories that contrasts with Father&apos;s exploitative world of mechanical human relations.  \n\nThe exquisite Joycean epiphany of snow is similarly double-edged - is it dreamt or real?; either way, the problems aren&apos;t resolved - the children might be saved, but she is trapped behind the window, alone but secure. This lovely film, never as depressing as an outline of its story might suggest, full of an animating camerawork that belies its characters inability to move, is very similar to Lynne Ramsey&apos;s later RATCATCHER, but, while its stylistic tastefulness means it never risks Ramsey&apos;s glaring lapses, its reserve means it doesn&apos;t quite capture her haunting poetry either.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw the trailer for The Other Boleyn Girl, I have to admit, it looked good, but like it wasn&apos;t accurate. I am a huge history buff, especially in the time of England&apos;s dark ages, I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry, Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown, her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn&apos;t portray her well in this film, but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I&apos;m not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne, the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more &quot;oomph&quot; sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.\n\nThe Boleyn has quite a family, a mother, father, a son, and two daughters. After failing at several attempts for Queen Catherine to have a son heir to King Henry&apos;s thrown, he wishes for a mistress. Sir Thomas Boleyn offers his daughter, Anne, but when King Henry sees Thomas&apos;s other daughter, Mary, he is smitten with her and wants her as his mistress. She gives birth to a son, but they are not married and she is looked down upon. Anne is given a second chance to come back after a marriage that was not granted and then annulled, but King Henry then falls for her and wishes her to give herself to him, but she puts up a fight and tells him not until she assumes the crown and to be his wife. But she fails to give him a son, her life depends on it as well sadly.\n\nThe true story of Anne Boleyn is very sad, but extremely interesting, I wouldn&apos;t recommend the book, just go for a regular history book when it comes to this story. But for the movie, The Other Boleyn Girl, I liked it, it had good acting, beautiful costumes and sets, and a very good story. If you are looking for a history lesson, this is not the film for you, but if you are looking for a good movie, then watch it. Just like the film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, they make the story a little more juicy, it&apos;s for the sake of some audience members who don&apos;t understand why England has the system it does, but it still makes for good drama.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Liebermans&apos; entry in the original slasher craze is definitely more well made and intelligent than some. In fact, in making it he wasn&apos;t so much inspired by &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; as he was &quot;Deliverance&quot;. He and his crew make this a powerfully atmospheric outing, utilizing the real Oregon woods to great effect, and turn it into a fun survival-of-the-fittest yarn, even developing the two main characters in interesting ways.\n\nFive young adults venture into the Oregonian mountains to do some camping and check out the local land that one of them has supposedly inherited. Before long they begin to be victimized by a stealthy, heavyset psychopath.\n\nSlasher movie fanatics who watch this sort of thing for gore and/or nudity will be quite disappointed with Liebermans&apos; film, as it&apos;s clear he has a different agenda going on. That&apos;s not to say, of course, that the women aren&apos;t attractive, or that there isn&apos;t some effective nastiness to be enjoyed. But what the director really wants to convey is the need to have a respect for nature - because it CAN kick your ass if you&apos;re not prepared. He begins with an intense opening set piece and generates some truly unnerving suspense; this is the kind of film that can have a viewer literally on the edge of their seat. It&apos;s also stylishly done; take note of one scene transition in particular. Brad Fiedel, who a few years later gained his fame with his theme for &quot;The Terminator&quot;, supplies a music score that is chilling in its subtlety. (The whistling is a really nice touch.)\n\nThe better than usual cast features some very familiar actors: Gregg Henry, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin, Chris Lemmon (Jacks&apos; son), and George Kennedy as the veteran forest ranger who&apos;s aware that the area is fraught with danger. The gorgeous Deborah Benson, who really should have been able to enjoy a much more visible career, is a standout as the female lead who starts out as a rather tentative character, starts to cut loose, and ultimately finds her inner strength. John Hunsaker is extremely creepy as the killer.\n\nThere&apos;s one well executed plot twist along the way, and at the end an innovative and memorable way of dispatching our villain. The pacing is deliberate, the camera-work and cinematography excellent, and the scenery beautiful, in what has to be one of the more unheralded horror films of its time. It comes highly recommended.\n\nEight out of 10.",

The plot has nothing to do with the game! the characters do not look like anything from the game, and the story is placed in the future. When I first heard of the movie, they said Sammo Hung was to play Heihachi, but in the movie he is an inspector wearing a silvery hat, and a good guy! But enough of that! a futuristic Stormriders is also what I would call it. It has some Martial arts in it(the training sequences with Yuen Biao is good stuff) but there are a lot of CGI in this flick, but I liked it! the story is so so, the sequences with the young heroes and their &quot;love-affairs&quot; are boring and slows the movie down. All in All an o.k. flick, it is great to see Yuen Biao in action again, that alone is reason enough to watch this!"

Also appearing is Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah as the ever reliable villain. E.C. is Hong Kong&apos;s answer to The Dirty Dozen where a group of Chinese/American criminals go on a suicide mission to destroy a missile ammunition dump left behind by Marines in Vietnam. The tone is lighter than John Woo&apos;s Bullet In The Head, but is taken serious enough to care about the characters, move along the story and sell the abundant and insane action scenes. There is enough bonebreaking martial arts, crazy stunts, as well as a barrage of machine gunfire and explosions to please the most jaded of action fans. Overall, Eastern Condors more than delivers and I always enjoy re watching this action classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Typical Spanish comedy of the 2000s with crazy situations , entertainment , amusement and it results to be acceptable. In BOYSTOWN (Chuecatown), Victor (Pablo Puyol) is a real estate agent in the quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Chueca in Madrid. But he hides a grisly secret; he is a nasty murderer who murders people , when apartments become available for sale, then he kills the elderly women owners and disguises them as suicides , in order to attempt to transform the neighborhood into a hip gayborhood like the Castro in San Francisco and Chelsea in New York. The latest victim is the elderly woman next door apartment to gay couple Leo (Pepón Nieto) and Rey (Carlos Fuentes) who eventually inherit the apartment and hands it over as a gift to Antonia, his mother Antonia (Concha Velasco) . But Victor only wants high income gays to move in and he starts a scheme to remove Antonia from the premises . Later on , the cunning Inspector Mila (Rosa Maria Sardà) and her charmingly clueless son Luis (Eduardo Soto) are assigned by their chief to investigate the murders . Meanwhile , Victor will seduce Leo in order to gain access to his apartment so he can kill Concha Velasco . \n\n Funny and amusing situations to give us a decent movie plenty of fun happenings , absurd incidents and many other things ; and that , at least , kept me entertained for the almost half an hour of duration . The main premise results to be a criminal spree carried out by a cocky killer who murders elderly women to take their apartments ; after that he refurbishes and decorates the apartments to sell them to gay couples with high purchasing power and to transform Chueca into a kind of London Soho area. The film moves in fits and starts most of which would be desirable , with more traps the viewer resists any kind , and some moments of enjoyment and others quite a few disconcerting . As the silly vicissitudes of the starring are so repetitive and the most part results to be rich in absurdities and implausibilities . It is one of the first Spanish comedies in which gays are main protagonists and they really take the surprising decisions and twisted initiatives . Hilarious and entertaining film , brimming with comic mishaps, laughs , sexy seductions, twists , and more killings . Rightly enjoyable but middling and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining events and amusement . It achieved a big office success , though was panned by reviewers , receiving mediocre critiques . The protagonist duo , Pepon Nieto, Carlos Fuentes , are passable and sympathetic , though they give exaggerated interpretations . Attractive cast plenty of good actors such as : Pablo Puyol plays a killer who hides a terrible secret: he makes apartments available for sale by murdering the old ladies owners that live in them. Likeable Rosa Maria Sarda plays the eccentric Police Inspector Mila, a peculiar woman with many phobias , giving a decent acting , as always , and her son is amusingly played by Eduardo Soto . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the veteran Concha Velasco who delivers one of the most enticing screen acting . Concha Velasco plays Antonia who is always meddling in his relationship with Leo, whom she despises. At the same time , support cast delivers an agreeable acting such as Mariola Fuentes , Eduardo Casanova , and cameo by Josele Roman . \n\nCatching musical score by David San José and adequate cinematography with juicy atmosphere by Juan Carlos Lausín , though a perfect remastering being necessary . Being well produced by notorious producers Julio Fernández/Carlos Fernández from Filmax, that have produced successes as Transsiberian, Quarantine, Sultanes, Diario de una ninfomana, Bullying and saga Rec . The motion picture was professionally directed by Juan Flahn . He is a good craftsman , a fine writer and director as cinema as TV , known for this Chuecatown (2007), Hábitos (1995) , Fantasmagórica (2014) , Las Flores de Bach , Insomnio , Canguros , La casa de los Lios , among others . rating : 6/10 . Acceptable and passable .",

This cinema scope, Technicolor movie with a beautifully choreographed and classically filmed song with the historical Taj Mahal in the background is a feast for the eyes.\n\nAlthough, the movie is not very serious or melodramatic, because the first one hour is just light comedy and adventure but subsequently, as the symbolic dirty politics of subcontinent takes shape, it lends Dilip to display his agonizing and emotionally charged acting prowess which is indeed commendable. Dilip can masterfully act as a light comedian, romantic lover, adventure seeking fellow as well as an honest politic leader ready to defy the machinations of the evil doers.\n\nOn the whole, it is a very interesting film, with good hit songs, nice screenplay and great acting by Dilip Kumar.",

Superb acting assists too, with Neeson and Sarsgaard both in good form, however it is Linney who shines the most as Kinsey&apos;s wife. But what gives the film such an extra boost is how confronting it manages to be. It is a daringly different film, packing the punches and managing to even have a few good laughs. The style feels unique, yet the technical aspects of the film are rather ordinary. It is a bit too uncomfortable to watch at times also, but it generally succeeds. Condon has quite evidently put a lot of effort into writing and directing the film, and without much question, his efforts have paid off with success.",

A parent&apos;s nightmare.\n\nThe story fast forwards to sixteen years later. One can imagine some of what transpired during those years: the guilt, the disruption, the agony, the grief. Julia is now divorced and living alone. Her previously happy demeanor is replaced with profound sadness. She has recently moved back to the city, which might offer challenges. Though she has an office job, she is socially dysfunctional. Then a young woman comes into her life and shakes it up.\n\nThis is a story about hope and the loss of hope. I found it to be very engaging. My only complaint is about an echo in the sound quality that is distracting in many scenes.",

Eastwood is a famous detective, but a massive heart attack just as he is about to catch a crazed serial killer forces him to an early retirement. Fast-forward a bit and Eastwood has received a new heart from a woman who has recently passed away. Slowly, but surely Eastwood&apos;s body is accepting the new organ and it appears that a healthy recovery is imminent. Things change though as a Hispanic woman (Wanda De Jesus) pays Eastwood a visit one day and explains that his new heart come from her younger sister, a woman who was killed in a convenient store. Quickly it becomes crystal clear that the killer in the store is in fact the same man who eluded Eastwood earlier. Now Eastwood is back one last time with a score to settle. Through Eastwood&apos;s journey he has to indulge a pesky neighbor (Jeff Daniels) who  wants to assist in the case, dodge cops Paul Rodriguez and Dylan Walsh and convince doctor Anjelica Huston that he owes De Jesus his time and help. &quot;Blood Work&quot; does do well for the majority of its running time, but the punchline comes way too fast and the finale is unsatisfying to say the least. Eastwood is pretty good as usual and Daniels is excellent in a comical supporting turn. Everyone else though ends up struggling to keep their intensity up as the production progresses. The &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; routine and the unnecessary blossoming romance between Eastwood and De Jesus make &quot;Blood Work&quot; play more like a television movie of the week than a theatrical release. With all this said, &quot;Blood Work&quot; does do enough good things to keep the audience watching and intrigued---most of the time anyway. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nAfter the events in the previous film, Kirk (William Shatner) risks his career by stealing the Enterprise to go to a restricted planet in hopes of finding Spock&apos;s body who they feel might be alive. Along the way they run into a Klingon leader (Christopher Lloyd) who wants to kill them all. STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH OF SPOCK probably shouldn&apos;t have worked since if you&apos;ve seen the second film then you know what happens to Spock. In order for this &quot;trick&quot; to work the producers and writers really needed to come up with something good and thankfully they did that. I won&apos;t ruin what this trick is in &quot;the search for Spock&quot; but I thought it was a rather smart move and it helped make the film a lot more believable. Leonard Nimoy steps into the director&apos;s chair here and it&apos;s obvious he&apos;s very comfortable there as he delivers a good looking film with a good pace and of course the main people back in action. Once again we&apos;ve got Shatner turning in a good performance as Spock and there&apos;s no question that he helps keep the film moving. I don&apos;t care what you want to say about the guy but there&apos;s no question that he owned this role and could play it in his sleep. Regulars like DeForrest Kelley, James Doohan and George Takei are also good in their roles. It seems a lot of people are split on Lloyd but I thought he was pretty good here. I liked seeing him under all the make-up and thought he did a good job even if the role itself wasn&apos;t the greatest. The special effects here are certainly a step up from the previous movie and I&apos;d also say that battle sequences are much better directed. Overall this film doesn&apos;t quite reach the levels as the second but it&apos;s certainly a worthy sequel."

If this sounds familiar, it&apos;s because it&apos;s the same opening Stanley Kubrick designed for his version of the book--except that Warhol, working on a sub-Z budget, could only zoom backward, not track.\n\nVINYL is staged in what seems to be a corner of Andy&apos;s Factory loft, where a knot of S&amp;M kidnappers, languid dilettantes, plainclothesmen and JD&apos;s act out Burgess&apos; fable of a thug&apos;s &quot;cure&quot; through mind control. The moralizing of Burgess&apos; novel gets instantly burned away in the wake of a kooky combination of elegant minimalist mise-en-scene, rough-trade heavy breathing, and the usual Warholian giggling at seemingly blithe freaks and damaged goods\n\nSome of the picture lags under the burden of Ronald Tavel&apos;s clunky sixties-off-Broadway writing, but the first sequence is sheer amazement--climaxing with the droog Gerard Malanga&apos;s motto-delivering monologue (a pinnacle among Warhol is-this-supposed-to-be-bad? scenes) and his nutty chicken dance to Martha and the Vandellas&apos; &quot;Nowhere to Hide&quot;--played all the way through, twice. (The start-up of rendition #2 gets the movie&apos;s biggest laugh.)\n\nAs always in Warhol, the stasis of the image gives the picture the feeling of a window onto eternity. And the combination of extreme glamour and fox-in-the-henhouse cruelty, framed in compositions that recall heads in a vise, suggests the excitement this work must have had for an ambitious young Bavarian actor-playwright named Rainer Werner Fassbinder."

This movie is not for people who think about Amazon as a holiday destination but as the only unspoilt and undamaged area on this planet.\n\nTo people who do not like, I would suggest them to stick with Hollywood and Tom Cruise style movies.

The cast mostly carry&apos;s over from the second film along with new characters including the Immeasurably likeable Kyle Gass in a surprisingly on brand role. It continues the themes of cultural appreciation and the value of family both born and chosen but with a new vibrancy. New friends and villains who may just be friends we don&apos;t know well enough yet. Along with these philosophical ideations is and incredibly funny music sequence wich serves as a vehicle for almost 15mins of dog/music puns.\n\nOnly for viewers who want to be entirely delighted.",

      "reviewBody": "Enjoyable crossover with adventures , emotion , intrigue and spectacular fencing . ¨Zorro versus Maciste¨ by Umberto Lenzi stars the good-looking Pierre Brice , the bouncing Alan Steel , the ruthless and selfish Moira Orfei , the blonde and virtuous Maria Grazia Spina and the nasty Massimo Serato . The King Felipe IV of Nogara (it is actually a town from province of Verona) , Spain , leaving behind a testament naming one of his two nieces , the good girl , Isabel (Maria Grazia Spina) and the bad girl , Malva (Moira Orfei) as his successor , both of them desire eagerly for the throne and there , then , takes place the subsequent dispute . Meanwhile , general Saavedra carries the document that exposes the last will , walking through the Guadarrama jungles , but soon after he is attacked and killed . To bring the valuable document is assigned by one hand , El Zorro (Brice) , and the other hand Maciste (Steel). Meanwhile , Isabella to be aware El Zorro&apos;s true identity , an identity which both surprises and pleases her . Along the way the giant starring showing some hunk skills , such as : Samson (in U.S. version) or Maciste throwing a stone over a Croc , lifting prison bars and a bridge , and , ultimately , fighting against multiple enemies . \n\nThis Spaghetti Zorro/Musclemen in middle budget is filled with noisy action , thrills , spectacular fights , horse pursuits by Zorro and sword-play . This Zorro is decently starred by Pierre Brice , he took a chance and jumped from modern action and Western genre to costumed Italian adventure . That same year , 1963 , German producer Horst Wendlandt searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief Winnetou on a Western movie titled ¨Apache Fury¨ adapted from novels by Karl May and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival . Pierre got the role and portrayed &quot;Winnetou&quot; in ten more movies with his co-star Lex Barker as &quot;Old Shatterhand&quot;. Here Brice steals the show as a mild-mannered poet , Ramon , and as the brave Zorro . Soon after Zorro/Pierre Brice team up with Maciste to bring about a proper resolution to the crown succession , this is Alan Steel . Sergio Ciani made lots of roman-epic-Italian films also called ¨Musclemen movies¨ or ¨Sword and sandals¨ as well as costumer sword-fight and a few adventures , and Spaghetti Western . Steel&apos;s luck changed when Italian director Gianfranco Parolini persuaded him to star ¨Sansone¨ (1961) along with Brad Harris and later on , he continued to play several others . On numerous occasions Steel was asked to play the legendary Greek hero , as well as the equally well-built demigods , even though the film titles often fused (or confused) them in their titles . Steel played the mythic Maciste in great number of movies was randomly assigned the identity of Hercules , Goliath , Samson or Aron for U.S. viewing . As he played a great number of Peplums , such as : 1962 Ursus, Il Rebel Gladiatore , 1962 Rocha , son of Sanson , 1964 Sansone e Il Tesoro Degli Incas , 1964 Maciste against ghosts , 1964 Ercole Contro Roma , 1964 Sansone Contro Il Corsario , 1963 Golia e Il Cavaliere Mascherato , 1964 Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus , and 1964 Three avengers . \n\nThe first Spanish/Italian Zorros were ¨Vengeance of Zorro¨ and ¨L&apos;Ombra di Zorro¨ (1962) by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Frank Latimore , Paul Piaget and Robert Hundar . Other Zorro filmed by that time were ¨Zorro I Tres Moschietheri (1962) by Luigi Capuano with Gordon Scott ; ¨Zorro all Corte di Spaña¨ (1963) by Luigi Capuano with Giorgo Ardisson ; ¨Zorro all Corte Di Inghiterra¨ by Francisco Montemurro with Franco Ressel ; ¨Three swords of Zorro¨ by Ricardo Blasco with Guy Stockwell and Mikaela ;¨ El Jiuramento Di Zorro¨ by Blasco with Tony Russell ; ¨Zorro Il Ribelle¨ by Piero Pirotti with Howard Ross ; ¨Zorro Marquis De Navarre¨ (69) by Franco Montemurro with Moretti ; Il Figlio Di Zorro¨ (1973) by Gianfranco Baldanello , ¨Adventures of Zorro¨ with George Hilton and two directed by Jose Luis Merino with Charles Quiney and Maria Pia Conte as ¨Zorro the rider of vendetta¨ and ¨Zorro of Monterrey ¨ .\n\nThe motion picture was poor but professionally directed by Umberto Lenzi who made his directorial debut with an adventure movie : ¨Queen of the Seas¨ (1961) . Other pirate/sword flicks followed, starting with ¨Pirates of Malaysia¨ (1964) starred by Steeve Reeves, which was part of the height of the career of fictitious tales of historic or legendary characters including Robin Hood , Catherine the Great , Zorro , Sandokan and Maciste . He subsequently directed a ¨Fumetti¨ titled The mask of Kriminal (1966) . After directing a war film and two &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot; , Lenzi turned to the Giallo genre with ¨Orgasmo¨ (1969). During the 1970s, Lenz filmed a number of Giallo and thrillers , among them : ¨So Sweet, So Perverse¨, ¨Seven Blood-Stained Orchids¨ and ¨Eyeball¨ . Lenzi turned to the police thrillers called ¨Polizieschi¨, which rejuvenated his confidence and his popularity . Titles like ¨Almost Human¨ , ¨Free Hand For a Tough Cop¨ and ¨Brothers Till We Die¨ were the most popular and brutal of the thrillers . Lenzi is an expert on wartime genre as he proved in ¨Desert commandos¨ , ¨Battle of commandos¨ , ¨From hell to victory¨ , ¨Young Lions¨ and ¨Bridge to hell¨. Prior to the Polizieschi , Lenzi directed ¨Man from Deep River¨ , which was the start of the Italian cannibal sub-genre . Later on , he directed two very gory jungle cannibal features , ¨Eaten Alive¨ and ¨Make Them Die Slowly ¨which was banned in 31 countries , made Lenzi distance himself from the cannibal genre . This attractive adventure ¨Zorro versus Maciste¨ is rated 5.5/10",

Toni Collette is excellent as usual, as well as Shirley MacLaine, yet I couldn&apos;t help thinking while watching that I should read the book it was based on and get a deeper look at these people and their lives. I felt the film could have gone into more detail and I expected it to be longer, as so many plot developments felt somewhat simplified to fit them all in to a 2-hour running time. That&apos;s my biggest criticism of the film, but it was enjoyable in general and I had a wonderful time watching. A few other things I enjoyed: the Rocky reference (my favorite), and the opening sequence during the credits. I have to credit this last one to both screenwriter and director for this incredible opening, which in completely visual terms sets up the film&apos;s themes. The titles are presented in cuts between the two sisters, highlighting both their conflict and their connection to one another. Generally, it has a nice balance between dead-seriousness and light drama, but I wish there was more of it to comment on.",

      "reviewBody": "759 captures beautifully the hardships and successes of being a young teen in a Boy Scout troop from the inner city. The chosen story line for this film was bold and unpretentious. The story follows a new scout, Keith, on his first camping expedition with troop 759. As Keith struggles through his first days, the camera quietly captures his unrelenting determination. The beautiful &quot;cut&quot; of 759 keeps the viewer intimately engaged and invites the viewer to participate by cheering the accomplishments of Keith and his fellow scouts as they near the end of their summer scouting experience. The haunting music adds a special nostalgia to the picture. Keith&apos;s mother&apos;s voice is the voice you hear that guides him and cheers him on through his challenges. As camp ends, the viewer wishes for the next season to begin. Essentially, 759 has heart! Bravi!",

      "name": "My God does not call me a slave or the Heroic life of the Novgorod major",
      "reviewBody": "Drama, historical thriller. The film adaptation of the poem of the same name by the Soviet screenwriter Sergei Narovchatov and at the same time the Novgorod epic epics about Vasily Buslaev. I have not read the epic, nor the poem, but I have heard a little about this character, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. Before watching, I watched remotely enthusiastic reviews about this picture, and Vasily&apos;s phrase &quot;My God does not call me a slave&quot; is widely known, so I wanted to see the original source of all this - and people were not lying, this is really a worthy movie that even managed to surprise me in the last third. And here is my brief opinion for you - the heroic life of the Novgorod major. I want to note right away that there are no serious disadvantages in the picture (although there are some comments that I will express in a separate paragraph), so we will focus on the bright advantages of this dramatic and historical action movie.\n\nSo, here they are: 1. The scenario - the picture tells us the story of Vasily Buslaev, the son of a Novgorod posadnik, who majorizes, using his power and his strength. The whole of Novgorod suffers from his tricks (except for the common people, whom Vasily does not offend). This would have continued on, if not for Vasily&apos;s spontaneous decision to go on a campaign with a loyal squad in order to save the captured Russians from foreign captivity, because the time is restless (the Mongol invasion is about to break out). The hero, together with his faithful companions and the brave Princess Xenia, enter into battle with enemies, visit Tsargrad itself, participate in local political intrigues, and upon arriving home Vasily will have to really work hard, because the internal enemy is much more dangerous than the external one. Yes, it was the showdown in Novgorod that surprised me, because the creators very accurately conveyed the very atmosphere of this separatist nest, which finally managed to be cleaned up only under Ivan Vasilyevich the Fourth. Novgorod is a real snake&apos;s nest, no worse than Constantinople, Paris or Rome of those years. But the heroic strength, loyal friends and loyalty to the Motherland will allow Vasily to overcome all difficulties. The finale of the picture is dramatic, and even disturbing, and no longer looks like a &quot;fairy tale&quot;, as this movie is often called. This is a drama and a very cheerful historical thriller.\n\n2. Costumes and decorations - the clothes of Russians, Romans and others look pretty good (if you don&apos;t look closely, of course, because then the budget of the picture will be visible). Vasily&apos;s clothes were especially good at the wedding - well, just a handsome man of handsome men. The costumers did their best. And Novgorod itself served as the scenery. I&apos;ve been there, I recognize some places. Therefore, it was possible with the atmosphere. You look - and you are literally transported to medieval Russia in the first half of the thirteenth century.\n\n3. Drama - the picture is very much aimed at realism, showing political intrigues and what internecine strife can lead to. The bondage of the Russians among the Romans is perfectly shown, the Mongolian threat is felt in the gut, because we practically won&apos;t see them on the screen, the Novgorod boyars and merchants are a hotbed of all the troubles of the city, who are even ready to kill Vasily so that they cannot carry out their plan, because their position and authority in the city should not suffer. There is blood on the screen, although there is very little of it. Therefore, empathy for the hero and the Novgorod people is complete.\n\n4. Fights and battles - they are quite cheerful, and it is interesting to watch them, although do not expect anything outstanding. It is directly visible that the fight is almost nominal. But there is a dramatic intensity, there is a sense of danger, and you worry about the heroes, because there are usually more enemies.\n\n5. Patriotism - the painting teaches love for the Motherland, for their land, for their people, for the best and most honest representatives of this people, for their family, friends. For when the enemy comes, we need to put aside all grievances and go to battle, because no one but us will do it. And the major, and the merchant, and the shipbuilder and the fisherman will act as a united front against the foreign adversary. That&apos;s why this picture is not being played on federal channels instead of all sorts of &quot;Zoi&quot;, &quot;Ivanov Denisovich&quot; and others, well, you understand what I wanted to say now. After all, the picture is relevant now more than ever, because there is a war in Novorossiya.\n\nNow about some remarks. The beginning of the picture is extremely chaotic, and it gives only one thing - an understanding of what era we are talking about. Traces of installation are visible, and the picture needs to be restored (the sound is good). Another picture is fleeting, as if rushing somewhere.\n\nA little about the main characters: 1. Vasily Buslaev, performed by Dmitry Zolotukhin, is a hooligan and a kind of rake who decided to become a defender of the Russian land due to a difficult situation, and it will not be superfluous to do a good deed. A brave, smart, cunning and resourceful man who, with his strength and his charisma, is able to do great things. Dmitry Lvovich was very convincing in the role of the hero Vasily. Bravo!\n\n2. Ksenia, performed by Irina Alferova, is a princess who recovered in search of her father as part of Vasily&apos;s squad. A strong, smart, brave girl who knows how to heal, who is very fond of our hero. Irina Ivanovna was great in this role. Bravo!\n\nThe rest of the actors played no worse, and each deserves separate praise.\n\nMy rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

I&apos;d also like to comment on a post I read here, where the writer was &apos;distressed&apos; by the characters in this film displaying VERY antiquated and unhip desires - like, dare I say it... wanting to secure a successful career, find love, and get married by age 30. Wow, can you imagine people nowadays feeling that way?! I personally find it &apos;distressing&apos; to think that we live in a society where having traditional desires is made to be odd. I&apos;m in my 20s and know many other people who are looking for these same things. So go figure, I actually found this perspective in a modern film refreshing.",

      "reviewBody": "This has always has been my all time favorite romantic comedy. Thanks to Billy Wilder&apos;s creative genius this film works despite Gary Cooper being miscast as the leading man. Regrettably, Gary Cooper was not only too old, but lacked the charm and suaveness needed for the role. Cooper was also in the twilight of his career and was suffering from health problems when the film was made. Cary Grant or Gregory Peck would have been more appropriate for the role of Frank Flannagan, the womanizing jet setter who falls madly in love with the daughter of a detective who has been investigating him. Nevertheless even with a miscast Gary Cooper the film works ....thanks to the marvelous performances of Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier, who play the young innocent musician daughter and her snooping, pooping private detective father. The title song &quot;Fascination&quot; with original music by F.D. Marchetti and Franz Waxman serve as a romantic thread that runs tightly through out the entire cinematic heart throbbing experience. Billy Wilder&apos;s more noted films such as &quot;The Apartment&quot; and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; may have garnered more recognition than this film over the years, but in my opinion none of them have the charm that this film has to offer. In fact if one is willing to &quot;What if?&quot;, and trade off Gary Cooper for Gary Grant for the role of Frank Flannagan, I suspect that that this film would have been right up there with the best romantic comedy of all time, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "In the movie, LOL, the character, Lola, has a poster for the smash-hit, Juno, hanging in her bedroom. I know, I know. Analyzing a detail as small as this might sound nitpicky but just hear me out.\n\nJuno was a movie about a teenager who addressed the people she loved and the people she had problems with, in person. Juno revealed an ultrasound picture of her baby to its future adoptive parents, in person. She laid out an entire living room set on Paulie Bleeker&apos;s front lawn, to tell him she was pregnant, in person. The reason its main character maintained quick-witted comebacks and came up with ironic allegories, at the drop of a hat, was because of her characteristic of going out and exploring new things. That movie was so refreshing because it took place in a world in which teenagers didn&apos;t constantly have the glow of a cell phone screen, reflecting off of their faces. In fact, there was only one part in the film involving a phone conversation between two people...and both sides had their phones plugged into a jack!\n\nSo why does LOL&apos;s mentioning of such a great movie bother me? Because its own message contradicts Diablo Cody&apos;s vision and her faith in teenagers. Cody believed in a world in which adolescents might actually look up from their gadgets, turn to each other and like, talk. Hell, there actually is a scene from Wall-E, in which two morbidly obese men favor looking at monitors with video feed each other, when they&apos;re in floating chairs, side by side. Juno spits in the face of such technological dependence.\n\nLOL, on the other hand, condones the non-stop usage of iPods, Twitter and other sites of the moment. Its lead characters are so reliant of online social networks, where every sentence is simplified and shortened, that once they finally log off, they use phrases like &quot;it&apos;s good to love someone so much it hurts.&quot; A line like that wouldn&apos;t even make it into Juno&apos;s deleted scenes section on the DVD. LOL celebrates the idea of kids, hunching their heads over a five by three inch screen all day long, as the rest of the world passes them by. Don&apos;t get me wrong - I&apos;m well aware that there actually are teenagers in the world who are this overly consumed. With it being near impossible to find a person between the ages of 18 and 29 NOT on a phone within a three hour period of time, writer and director, Lisa Azuelos, isn&apos;t exactly making up fiction here. But to try to portray these hypnotized kids as deep thinking and complex is wrong. How could they have the drive to reflect on who they are when they don&apos;t even put effort into typing out full words into text messages? Like I said, it&apos;s fine for characters like these to exist because there are real world people like this. But don&apos;t try dragging another film down to your level when it boasts unexplained emotions, open for interpretation while your own best moment of self-reflection consists of the line &quot;Every year, it&apos;s weird going back to school but here we are, just going with the flow&quot;. Oo-hoo-hoo, look out, Hemingway.",

I don&apos;t know what combination it was, but &apos;die andere liga&apos; is one of the most charming, sweet, touching, brave, sensitive film I have seen.\n\nhayat is a 20 year old girl (beautifully played by karoline herfurth) who loves football. breast cancer very suddenly robs her of a breast - and more. intensely loved by her father (again, beautifully played by thierry van werveke), she is not allowed to play football again. this film traces her struggles after the one thing which robbed hayat&apos;s strength, her pride, and her one breast. and it also reduced her to a child, when it comes to boys and love. meeting toni (ken duken charms the birds off the tree in this role) unwittingly begins her little journey..\n\none of the superb thing about this film is that the director did not pander to cheesy feel-good endings and Hollywood plots. the dialogue was fantastically funny (I did not expect this).\n\nit truly did touch me more than I thought it would. a truly recommended great film. go watch it.",

It has never been released in this country, Spain, nor seen in television either here, in Belgium - where I lived 1973-1993 - or several other European countries linked to Brussels TV, U.K. not excluded. After all these years, I remember that all the actors are terrific, Cagney outstanding. Young - not surprisingly - was convincing, and the music score - an unfinished piano concert - haunting. From other comments, I assume that a DVD of this noir classic would be most welcome by Cagney fans of all ages."

      "reviewBody": "A Woman Between Wolf and Dog (or Een Vrouw Tussen Hond en Wolf as it is known in The Netherlands and Flanders) is a very brave film. It focuses on the thin line between resistance and collaboration in the Second World War. Protagonist is Lieve, a woman married with Adriaan who serves in the SS on the eastern front. The people in Antwerp ignore because of this and she leads a lonesome life until Francois, member of the resistance, takes shelter in her house. After a couple of days they start a relationship with saves Lieve from punishment after the German defeat. But then it turns out that Adrian returns safe and sound (physically at least) from the battlefield. He is imprisoned but Lieve still chooses to save her marriage to the astonishment of Francois. It appears that Adriaan has no regret of his choices and living with him becomes harder and harder for Lieve and their son.\n\nBecause choices in a situation of war are so difficult we also see a lot of hypocrisy. People of Antwerp who played no role in the resistance but show a lot of bravery after the Germans are gone. People in the countryside who live a life of plenitude while people in the city are hungry.\n\nIt is always difficult to prevent a story that takes fifteen years to become fragmentary. This movie doesn&apos;t succeed in avoiding this. We see a lot of very short scenes that try to tell a coherent story. Sometimes I was confused by the choices made by the director. You need to have some knowledge about the history of the Second World War in Belgium to understand why Adriaan choose to fight with the Germans at the east front while he is a Flemish nationalist. On the other hand there is a scene inside a cinema that seems to be inserted to give the viewer more specific understanding of history.\n\nThe acting is slightly disappointing. It is strange when you have a great actor like Rutger Hauer on the set to leave him out of the script for about an hour. It is also unbelievable that a flamboyant guy like Francois falls in love with a woman like Lieve who is very withdrawn and seems to carry the weight of life on her shoulders. What doesn&apos;t help is the lack of chemistry between these characters. Because the film is so fragmentary you are not drawn into the story and the characters. In the mass scenes you see clearly that the budget of the movie was limited. It almost seems that beside some extras the streets of Antwerp are abandoned. I think the film could have benefit from a shorter time span (say the moment that Antwerp is freed from the Germans) with some flash backs to tell the background of Lieve, Adriaan and Francois. It would involve the viewer more and the main characters would have been more present.",

      "reviewBody": "Philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story.  Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who has been stricken with a horrible disease.  He plays a convincing role as Andrew Beckett, a man who knows the meaning of justice and knows what exactly his rights are.  What Mr. Hanks also accomplishes with this role is he breaks free from the stereotypes society has dictated on the average gay man.  Andrew Beckett is not feminine in any way, he does not have a flair for shoe shopping or hold his arms limp-wristed or talk with a lisp.  For these reasons, it has been said that Tom Hanks was not believable as a gay man.  I strongly disagree.  Andrew Beckett is a normal man who enjoys smoking cigars and takes joy in the law.  Who would think he was gay?  This is precisely the point the movie is trying to make.  A gay man may be walking among you, every day you may see him at school, may play raquetball with him at the gym, may work late hours with him at the office... but yet you&apos;d never suspect he is gay because he does not wear loafers decorated with tassels and he has a low-pitched voice.  Men are men, whether gay or not, and should be treated as such -- gays do not deserve special treatment but they deserve equal treatment.  Because in most areas, gay men are just like straight men.  I commend Tom Hanks for showing the world that gay men can be just as manly as any other.  His Oscar was well-deserved and the movie was amazingly ground-breaking.",

      "reviewBody": "Bellocchio&apos;s variation on &quot;If&quot;, is even more surreal and bleak than Lindsay Anderson&apos;s vision of a boy&apos;s school as a metaphor for larger society. Here it&apos;s a school of spoiled rich out of control kids stashed away by their families (fathers mostly) in a school run by dark hearted priests. It&apos;s hard to tell which group is worse, as both tussle for control of the school and each other. \n\nBeautifully shot (as are all Bellocchio&apos;s films). The film has the Church clearly starting to lose it&apos;s corrupted influence, but it&apos;s not like we have much to be cheery about in the thought of these rich young thugs running the world either. \n\nThe surprising thing is how much of this is quite funny. The themes may be depressing, but the individual characters and their actions are often darkly comic (sometimes too much for me, one boy&apos;s voice has been dubbed with something that sounds like Mel Blanc created it for a cartoon. Amusing at first, then grating). \n\nSome will hate this – it is repetitive and grim and adolescent. But then, the young Bellocchio might argue, so is the world and those who run it.",

      "reviewBody": "The film opens with a perky song sung by title character Nicoletta as she drives a carriage at top speed while driving a doctor home over country roads. The family wonders where Nicoletta had disappeared to. She had escaped from her room again.  That girl...always running off. This time it was to fetch the doctor in time for a birth...of a colt.\n\n This is a delightful escapist comedy with songs and suggests some of the Gregory La Cava movies of the 1930s. Although a completely inconsequential piece, the movie is well-made and exudes a great amount of charm. \n\n The young heroine Nicoletta is played by Chiaretta Gelli and she reminded me of  Deanna Durbin in her feisty tomboyish charm.  The plot is a silly inconsequential affair about the bratty and unmanageable Nicoletta (birichino = little devil) who wants to prevent her sister&apos;s marriage to an incorrigible womanizer, and after their marriage, to tell her about his peccadillos and infidelities.  Her sister Livia is played by Anna Vivaldi and her man Roberto is played by  Franco Scandurra.\n\nNicoletta has been sent to boarding school, where she is a thorn in the side of the teachers and doesn&apos;t take well to schooling and doesn&apos;t impress when she&apos;s called upon. &quot;It&apos;s a month they&apos;ve been wanting to know when Napoleon died.  I know but I won&apos;t tell them!&quot;  The highlight of her short-lived school days before she runs away is parents&apos; day.  A chorus of girls is performing on the school lawn, but the excluded  Nicoletta is giving her antiphonal commentary from a window above: &quot;You all have ugly faces!&quot;\n\nThe supporting cast is quite good  with special  praise to be given to Armando Falconi as Nicoletta&apos;s doting dad Leopoldo and Carlo Campanini as the hilarious lawyer Marchi whom Nicoletta inadvertently reaches by phone when locked in the infirmary at school and whose help she later enlists to attempt to rescue Livia from the clutches of her Don Juan husband.\n\nThe lively direction is by Raffaello Matarazzo, later to be known for his many popular Italian weepies. The music is by Nino Rota, who uses at some points a motif that we would later hear in his 1963 score for Visconti&apos;s &quot;The Leopard.&quot;  The movie was never released commercially in America but had showings at New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art in 1978 as part of the Italian Fascist era series &quot;Before Neo-realism.&quot;"

He should have stuck to playing baddies, however he&apos;s very good in the gunfight scenes here, where he really brings some impact to an otherwise flat direction. The biggest flaw for me was the terrible acting by the child actor Donald McDonald and had a more accomplished child been chosen it would have been a big improvement as the other acting roles are generally quite good, particularly Raymond Burr and his girlfriend floozy Reba Tassell who both exude evil. Some of the dialogue is quite decently presented as well but the delightful Nancy Gates is wasted and there&apos;s zero chemistry between her and O&apos;Brian. A clear rip off of High Noon but 4 stars out of 10 for trying and the gunfights.",

      "reviewBody": "With THE RAID (1991), producer-director Tsui Hark and co-director Ching Siu Tung (fresh from the &quot;Chinese Ghost Story&quot; trilogy) try their hand at wartime action comedy. In Japanese-occupied Manchuria in the WWII era, a group of Chinese nationalists sets out to destroy a Japanese poison gas factory and their opponents include a Japanese military officer and his girlfriend who has built up a false public image as a Chinese glamour girl. (They are played by Hong Kong star Tony Leung Ka Fai and Eurasian actress Joyce Godenzi.) The Japanese villains align themselves with Emperor Pu Yi (the famed &apos;Last Emperor&apos; who had been deposed in 1911 but was actually re-installed as puppet ruler of the Manchu-kuo government set up by Japanese occupiers during WWII).\n\nThe Chinese rebel band grows to include a local gangster (played by Jacky Cheung) and the film&apos;s nominal hero, Dr. Choy, a doctor/swordsman (played by comic actor Dean Shek), as well as a pair of young teenagers, one of whom is the doctor&apos;s spear-fighting niece. Since none of these characters is allowed to dominate the action at any given point, the audience never gets a handle on who to identify with.\n\nConsidering that the team of Tsui Hark and Ching Siu Tung were also responsible for the wildly imaginative Chinese GHOST STORY trilogy and the last two films in the SWORDSMAN trilogy (SWORDSMAN II and THE EAST IS RED), both masterpieces of &apos;wire fu,&apos; THE RAID can only be classified as a disappointment. While there are some amusing, farcical moments (including a bedroom scene involving several alternating participants), the comedy seems out of place amidst such a serious conflict, especially when the gruesome effects of the poison gas are revealed, while the action scenes, emphasizing slapstick, minimize the dramatic tension and offer little in the way of the imaginative staging these filmmakers are known for. There&apos;s no real point to any of the action scenes other than the need to put on a show. There are no significant martial artists in the cast, so the filmmakers had no fighting stars on the order of Jet Li (from SWORDSMAN II) or Wu Ma (from Chinese GHOST STORY) to work with. According to John Charles&apos; &quot;Hong Kong Filmography, 1977-1997,&quot; the film is based on a series of popular &quot;Uncle Choy&quot; picture books from the 1930s. The filmmakers use drawings and animated bits as links between segments.\n\nADDENDUM (6/17/15): Having watched this again for the first time in 14 years, I was a bit alarmed to realize that the occupying army in the film is never identified as Japanese, nor are any Japanese flags or insignia displayed. The only clue we have is the fact that the character of Kim Pak-Fai (Joyce Godenzi), a Chinese singer and lover of the ranking occupying officer (Tony Leung Ka-Fai), is revealed to be Kawashima Yoshiko who, in real life, was a Manchurian princess who was raised in Japan and worked on behalf of the Japanese during the war. Her fanciful exploits as a Mata Hari-type femme fatale here don&apos;t quite match anything she did in real life, as described in the recently published biography, &quot;Manchu Princess, Japanese Spy: The Story of Kawashima Yoshiko, the Cross-Dressing Spy Who Commanded Her Own Army,&quot; by Phyllis Birnbaum. Kawashima was the protagonist of two other films, the Hong Kong-produced biopic KAWASHIMA YOSHIKO (1990), starring Anita Mui, and LADY KARATE (1976), a Taiwan-made kung fu film starring Chia Ling, both of which I reviewed earlier this year for IMDb. She&apos;s also represented in Bernardo Bertolucci&apos;s THE LAST EMPEROR (1987), where her character name is Eastern Jewel and is played by Maggie Han. She was a fascinating, but tragic figure whose story has not yet been adequately presented on screen."

In this particular case he has been tasked to retrieve some microfilm from sources behind the Iron Curtain which detail Soviet missile technology. To that effect, this requires him to travel to both West Germany and Austria and while there he becomes attracted to a beautiful Swedish woman by the name of &quot;Antonia &apos;Toni&apos; Peters&quot; (Camila Sparv) and while getting better acquainted with her also uses their relationship to further conceal his clandestine activities. What he doesn&apos;t know, however, is that another secret organization has developed suspicions about him and are following his every move with the hope of turning the tables on him to their own advantage as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a rather dull and mundane spy film which seemed to focus too heavily upon quite normal and routine activities. Admittedly, both Stephen Boyd and Camila Sparv performed their roles in a solid manner but the overall lack of action and suspense was much too noticeable and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly.

I watched &quot;Morocco&quot; first time and was stunned - such a vivid movie and that in year 1930. Cary Cooper was also perfect, in fact, he shaped Marlene for her future performances. I don&apos;t agree with critique that she has bad movies. She is 100% quality. In her later life she show a little twitter in her relationship with Jean Gabin. The guy has a &quot;workers&quot; mentality and doesn&apos;t really deserve her. Anyway, women were never party to men and maybe she really believed they have a match. Still further she made appearances that I saw for first time in this footage. Was she really running somewhere that she so often fall? So, finally how is it possible no one to attend her funeral when she made so much for Hollywood. Thank You.",

Well, for one, director Franz Josef Gottlieb is a veteran of shallow teen- and even raunchier adult-comedies. However, the director seems unable to cope with the concept &apos;horror-film&apos;. The attempt to create a hybrid (to mind comes Roman Polanskis &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;) fails miserably. The jokes are so flat and outdated that they would have been considered lame in the 1950&apos;s and the horror elements are as frightening as a Halloween edition of &quot;The Muppets&quot;.\n\nSpeaking of veterans: Theo Lingen, Eddie Aren&apos;t, Roberto Blanco and Walter Giller are names that viewers of the time were extremely familiar with (they would appear in every second comedy of the period) and would guarantee at least a few uncomfortable giggles. In this case they do appear but none of them delivers.\n\nEvelyne Kraft as the protagonist cannot fill the shoes of anybody called &quot;Dracula&quot;. Yes indeed, she&apos;s cute like a button, the audience can&apos;t wait to see her (semi)-nude but her performance as Countess Dracula is thoroughly unconvincing.\n\nHaving spoken of the mandatory American import-actor, let&apos;s speak of Stephen Boyd who has a minor appearance as Count Dracula, looking as if they dressed him up for a costume-ball. Remember the Count from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;? Infinitely scarier. Sadly, this would be Boyd&apos;s final performance and you&apos;ll probably barely be able to recognize this wreck of a man who once was Masalla in &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. There could have been a more fitting epitaph.\n\nThe films ending is as much a letdown as the rest of the film and comes so sudden, one is almost convinced the crew had run out of film (if it weren&apos;t for Eddy Aren&apos;t of course, who has ended Edgar Wallace- and countless other German films that way).\n\nThere are first Grade vampire-comedies like &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;, B-grade like Clive Donners &quot;Old Dracula&quot;, stinkers like &quot;Dracula – Dead and Loving It&quot; but this film really tops the bad, bad vampire comedies. Not even bad as in &quot;so bad it is good&quot; but simply awful as a comedy and anaemic as a vampire film. Trust a seasoned Horror-flick fan: avoid this like the plague."
