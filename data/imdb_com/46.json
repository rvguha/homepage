      "reviewBody": "This DVD cost me about 3.99 euros and I&apos;ll tell you this right now.. I was ripped off. The story is stupid and at the very least not believable in the Finnish setting. A serial killer? I think there&apos;s been one serial case in the whole recorded history of this country. And still, the script was plain awful and full of bad dialogue, the actors were seriously bad and the story went nowhere. The only actor who could with a clear conscience be even called that, Tapio Liinoja, seems fittingly bored in the whole two scenes he has in the film. To sum it all up, this movie is just dreadfully boring and badly made. I read from the only previous comment on this film by another user, that the picture quality was excellent. Were we watching the same DVD?! It&apos;s horrible. Most of the scenes that take place at night are lit so badly you can hardly see what&apos;s even going on. And that includes the &quot;massive and surprising&quot; final showdown. Aki Louhimies made Levottomat as his graduation piece from film school. I think it&apos;s quite safe to say that this is nowhere near that effort. Avoid.\n\n* / *****",

      "reviewBody": "I see this film in straight connection with La Strategia del ragno also directed by Bertolucci 11 years before this one. Only with characters inversion, meaning that in this one the father goes along find out things about his son, hidden things, beyond what he looked like. In the 1970 film it is the son who finds out the life of his late father, his hidden secrets. Still I found the older movie much more appealing, in terms of the plot itself but also in terms of the direction also. It is obvious that a good plot estimulates direction but still this one could have been better. It has from times to times the quality seal from Bertolucci, but in general it&apos;s not as good as others. The end is very delayed, the film could have less 20 minutes that it would be better to watch. Some beautiful images along the time, as usual in Bertolucci, but than again somewhat meaningless as they are not many times in the context of the story.\n\nThough the film touches some important issues, such as terrorism in Italy&apos;s 1980&apos;. Also interesting in exploring how a man can &apos;use the blood&apos; of his own son just to get himself out of a difficult financial position. Not much more than this. It&apos;s worth watching if you like Bertolucci or if you have special interest in italian cinema. But don&apos;t judge the director just on this one. It is unfair, specially if we think that his second film after this one was The Last Emperor...",

Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next-door neighbor. I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end, the twist you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Also, what is interesting is the actors in the movie-you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer. Also there is Beverly D&apos;Angelo, who is underrated but great.",

      "reviewBody": "The Green Wave is just a taste of what documentary filmmaking might become in the era of social networking. The film is a collage of real life footage and animation, based entirely on blog posts that were written by a number of anonymous Iranians who experienced the aftermath of the election chaos in Tehran. Aesthetically there are certain parallels that can be drawn between The Green Wave and another political animation film, Waltz with Bashir. But unlike Wlatz With Bashir, The Green Wave uses its animation segments not to make intellectual statements on the terrors of war, but to fill in holes between the personal stories of showcased bloggers and the footage that the director of the film managed to access over the internet. The narrative is powered by the blog updates in a very un-cinematic way and so the images are merely the illustrations of the terror the Iranians had to embrace.\n\nThe collection of different personal takes on the political situation in Iran although not quite imaginative in its use of cinematic language, is definitely needed and was certainly appreciated by the audiences at Sundance. The bravery of the people who agreed to show their faces on the screen and make clear statements against the Ahmadinejad&apos;s regime are admirable; Ali Samadi Ahadi uses the means of social networking as a crucial tool in obtaining information about the abuse caused to the Iranian people during the unfair election of 2009 and does it very poignantly and with heart. He proves that even such atrocious regime as the one conducted by Ahmadinejad cannot withhold the truth completely in the era of facebook and Google. Most importantly though, Ahadi shows that as the means of communication change rapidly so does the language of cinema and so the political filmmaking must remember to reach for new sources of information and look for new forms of expression.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never been much of a fan of Burt Reynolds fan, but he happens to star in many 70&apos;s and early 80&apos;s movies that are right up my alley. We&apos;re talking about movies with charismatic macho man protagonists, fast cars, trucks so large they seem to be overcompensating for something else, infantile comedy and flamboyant action stunts. Movies like &quot;White Lightning&quot;, &quot;Hooper&quot;, The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;Sharky&apos;s Machine&quot;, &quot;Gator&quot; and of course the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; trilogy and I can&apos;t help the fact they all star Burt Reynolds. &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; is basically a very simplistic story and approximately three quarters of the film seems improvised at the spot, but a premise like this just can&apos;t fail. Two Texan big shots hire the notorious trucker Bandit to illegally transport a lorry of Coors Beer from Texarkana to Georgia in barely 28 hours. Bandit develops a nifty plan where his buddy Snowman drives the beer truck and he drives a Trans-Am in front to divert the attention of the coppers. During the wild and time-pressured ride, Bandit picks up the hyperactive runaway bride Carrie and becomes involved in a testosterone showdown with the fearsome Texan Sheriff Buford T. Justice. You easily forgive &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; for its lack of originality and ideas, simply because everyone involved in the film seems to be so very enthusiast and cheerful. Former stuntman Hal Needham delivers a fast- paced script and taut direction (his other film &quot;MegaForce&quot;, on the other hand is a terribly boring turkey) whilst all his cast members are having the time of their lives. Jerry Reed is excellent as the lesser cool sidekick Snowman and he also provides the film with a sublimely irresistible hillbilly soundtrack, including the fantastically catchy songs &quot;East Bound and Down&quot; and &quot;The Legend&quot;. Sally Field and Burt Reynolds definitely have on-screen chemistry, but the show is undeniably stolen by Jackie Gleason as the persistent and downright obsessive Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Heck, even his character&apos;s name alone is awesome to write and pronounce repeatedly! He has the best lines, allegedly a large part of them were ad-libbed, like when he says to his slow and unintelligent son: &quot;the first thing I&apos;m going to do when we get home, is punch your mother in the face&quot; (referring that the son can&apos;t possibly have inherited his stupidity from him).",

      "reviewBody": "Though some may argue that the older classic versions of Little Women with Katherine Hepburn and June Allison may be better because it sticks to the book, this is the only version that captures the spirit of the book.\n\nThough the filmmakers took license to cut away certain specifics, the end result is an absolutely gorgeous film that stands on it&apos;s own completely. One would be able to watch this film without ever having read or known the book and seen it as it&apos;s own film.\n\nThe film thrives on small scenes and nuances, moments of person to person contact, production design and cinematography, the all important score (which adds a great deal to the film). This delicate and complicated symbiosis between all aspects tactfully and poignantly creates the story, something missing from many movies these days which creates a tangible and effervescent emotional layer. Then the acting of one of the best ensembles to hit the screen in a long time. Keep an eye out for Susan Sarandon and Claire Daines in roles that ought to have been nominated along with Ryder. These actors create people that endear themselves to us, and make the film even more than it could have been.\n\nIt&apos;s a small scale masterpiece that will leave you in tears. The film is honest and true in it&apos;s portrayal of human emotion. It went from being an adaptation of the book to it&apos;s own story and portrayal of people and their lives. It&apos;s beautiful aesthetically and dramatically, and a real gem of a film.",

      "reviewBody": "The standard that Adam Sandler movies has set is pretty low, but even with such low expectations going to the movie, the movie still felt terrible. The gag is twins and ignoring that healthy identical twins with different genders is impossible, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman. And, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman a lot, ridiculously lot and so much so, that Jack Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are just supporting actors to the almighty squawking of Jill Adam Sandler.\n\nWe could say this is just Adam Sandler up to his usual antics but Jill Adam Sandler hogs up the screen time and nothing about her really makes any sort of logical sense. There is Al Pacino as himself who falls for Jill, a possibility that the writers explain away as madness or nervous breakdown of Al Pacino. Then, there is Jill who is loved by the kids and Jack&apos;s wife Erin (played by Katie Holmes) for reasons that Jill doesn&apos;t portray on screen and we are never shown, all we are shown is the mean and manipulative Jill. The Jill that Adam Sandler portrays is his own immature rendition of a woman, filled with toilet humor and displays of uncharacteristic skills and strength as positive attributes. Jill is portrayed uninteresting and vacuous though written differently, and that being the center of the movie makes the movie uninteresting and tiresome.\n\nThe movie would have been an acceptable Sandler movie if Jill had been played by a woman who could actually portray a big heart. The previous Sandler movies were enjoyable movies, but Jack and Jill is a real stinker, barely watchable. The only thing I found interesting was the background opulence of everyone around, thrown around so casually that it really feels like the big guys involved in the movie have severely lost touch with their audience and given way to sloth where they think anything they do is magical. Avoid the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Body Double is directed by Brian De Palma, he also co-writes the screenplay with Robert J. Avrech. It stars Craig Wasson, Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry, Deborah Shelton, Guy Boyd and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Stephen H. Burum.\n\nBrian De Palma continued his crusade to push buttons of the sensitive whilst homaging his hero Alfred Hitchcock, with this cheeky, garish, sleazy thriller. Even when moving away from Hitch like movies, he created a storm with Scarface (1983), so the critics of 1984 wondered if a return to suspense thriller territory would put the director back on an even cinematic keel? Not a bit of it! The reaction to Body Double was ridiculously over the top, apparently a misogynistic homage to the porn industry, with exploitation gore thrown in for good (bad) measure, Body Double was the devil&apos;s spawn in the eyes of critics. The public? Not so much, film was a sure fire hit at the box office.\n\nOf course today it seems all very tame, where not even a simulated drilling killing can raise the temperature of the audience, or that frank sexual language and bare bodies no longer makes cinema goers blush. On reflection now it&apos;s easy to view De Palma&apos;s movie as a visionary piece of work, a film gently poking the ribs of Hollywood and the MPAA, and as was always the case with his 70s and 80s work, he was a director who easily elicited a response from his audience. And with his box of cinematic tricks still impressive before he became over reliant on them, Body Double is a fascinatingly lurid viewing experience.\n\nThat it&apos;s Vertigo and Rear Window spliced together is a given, but that doesn&apos;t make it a bad film, besides which it bears the De Palma stamp as well, undeniably so. Plot finds Jake Scully (Wasson), a struggling actor with claustrophobia, thrust into a world of murder, obsession, deceit and paranoia, for when he house sits for a newly acquired friend, he spies a sexy lady through the telescope apparently being stalked by an odd looking Native American. To reveal more would spoil the fun of anyone watching for the first time, but suffice to say that Jake has entered the realm where neo-noir protagonists wander around wondering how and why they are in this mess.\n\nIt&apos;s pulpy and pappy, but in the best ways possible, and unlike many other films made by directors who ventured into similar territory, it&apos;s never boring (hello Sliver). Cast are appropriately cartoonish or animated, the twists fun if not hard to see coming, and with De Palma&apos;s visual panache cosying up nicely with Donaggio&apos;s musical score, Body Double is fine entertainment brought to us by a director with a glint in his eye. 8/10",

And it is entirely possible that when this picture was made the story elements had been used only dozens, rather than hundreds, of times before.  But while numerous movies more than fifty years old have held up very well, this is one that has become an unintentional parody of itself.\n\nThe romantic femme fatale, mourning a lost love of her youth, and convinced she can never love again; the dashing, devil-may-care adventurer, certain that no one female could ever hold him; the middle-aged paragon of duty, service and principle, asking only to be allowed to worship that desirable woman, expecting not love, but merely loyalty, in return; the coward scorned by his mates, living for nothing but a chance to redeem himself.  And much more, including British colonials, devious Arab chieftains, the burning desert, a suicide mission, memorable dying words, and of course, a young, spectacularly handsome Errol Flynn.\n\nThey don&apos;t make them like this anymore."

The second part has fanny dialogs, nice songs, good actors, New Year&apos;s magic and happy ending  all that what we liked so much in the firs part. I very much enjoyed the plot; It is closely connected with the first movie but is interesting and surprising. The atmosphere in the cinema during the film was fantastic  the move helped people to feel the beginning of the celebration.\n\nI should recognize, that the film is close only to the Soviet spectator. Most people, not knowing Russian traditions simply will not understand details which are so important. The idea, the characters - all this strongly influences those to whom the concept of wide soul is close. Acting is great...the main hero is a real «nice very nice gay», which you will like and a girl in the movie is gorgeous!!! The film is worth seen: it will make you laugh at the beginning and cry at the end. Only one thing is not liked by me  it is the mixture of styles in camera work. Also advertising in the movie is too obvious and annoys.\n\nConcerning everything, it is a great present for New Year!",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Man&apos; a limp piñata of clichéd characters, jokes and plots that begs to be hit...\n\nThe miscast Samuel L. Jackson stars as Derrick Vann, a caustic, gung ho Federal Agent who has 24 hours to recover a pile of stolen weapons and find his former partner&apos;s killers. This becomes much more challenging when the bad guys mistake salesman Andy Fiddler (Levy, also miscast) for the gun buyer. Now, Vann has to get Andy to pose as the front man in a sting operation.\n\nThe only thing that set&apos;s &apos;The Man&apos; apart from any other buddy cop movie is that it wastes the most talent in less time then you can say &quot;He&apos;s my bitch.&quot; I was planning on seeing &quot;Emily Rose&quot;, but it was sold out, so I got stuck with this limp, unnecessary buddy cop &quot;comedy&quot; with not an original idea in it&apos;s mess of clichés. Both actors have real talent, but are wasted, trying to do their best with weak material. While the film does have some laughs, it&apos;s a lame movie with recycled jokes that doesn&apos;t realize it&apos;s a lame movie with recycled jokes. That&apos;s the real problem here.\n\nBrainless movies are appreciated when they don&apos;t take themselves too seriously. &apos;The Man&apos; can&apos;t be classified in this category because It does take itself too seriously, and actually begins to think it&apos;s a passable movie. If I wanted to see brainless fun, there are much better options out there. Don&apos;t waste $10 on this movie, don&apos;t even wait for it on DVD. Avoid.\n\nThe Man: D(3 from 10)"

It is not the best L&amp;H (I leave that for others to debate, but the lean is towards `Way Out West&apos; or `Sons of the Desert&apos;), but it is far, far from their worst.\n\nThe operetta background seemed to work as well for Stan and Ollie as the opera did for the Marxes (`A Night at the Opera&apos;), Mae West (`Goin&apos; to Town&apos;), and the Stooges (`Microphonies&apos;), giving them something different and deliberately starchy to play against.\n\nIt is a shame that Thelma Todd died just about the time BG was released. Stan was said to have felt it inappropriate to show her in such a big part with her lurid death  which many claim was a mob-related murder  still heading the headlines.  The Hollywood hush-hush surrounding it may have also contributed to its excisingand the sadness was only worsened by its occurrence during the Christmas season and the arrival by mail of presents to various friends (including Stan) after her body had been found.  Roach himself (with the bigwigs in his corner) was said to have helped head off the DA&apos;s second inquest after Thelma&apos;s attorney had protested the suicide verdictanother reason, perhaps, behind her severely edited and retooled role.  Who begs for a dark cloud?\n\nBut how WELCOME to see Mae Busch back!  She always worked especially well with the team and gives that extra boost to Ollie in particular that one always got from a Maggie Dumont, Jan Duggan, or Symona Boniface.  Mae could play an absolute bitch, and you still loved her.  The added reunion with Jimmy Finlayson was great (`Oh, my GOOD eye!&apos;  an insider&apos;s joke that kills me every time), and we have the bonus of Our Gang&apos;s Darla as the adopted Arline.  Sweet, without being cloying.\n\nOne might decry songs such as `The Heart Bow&apos;d Down by Weight of Woe,&apos; but it&apos;s an operetta, folks.  There&apos;s going to be singing.\n\nAnd with routines like `the eyes are the windows to your soul&apos;; the fingers bit in the bar; the odd wrap-up gag; the wine bottling; Stan&apos;s bass/soprano switch; his search for Ollie&apos;s money; Darla&apos;s bedtime prayer; the butter churneven something as simple as Ollie claiming to be leaving for a zither lesson and then miming it with his fingers (whereupon Stan suddenly gets it  `Oh!&apos;)it&apos;s all great!  What more could one want?  They couldn&apos;t re-film `Sons of the Desert&apos; every year!  Give this baby a chance!\n\nNone of the latter day Fox-MGM movies can touch it; not even the best of `Jitterbugs.&apos;  `The Flying Deuces,&apos; unfortunately so long in public domain that it appears one is watching it through a pillowcase, is pretty good, but this one seems warmer and cinematically superior.  I prefer BG to some of its contemporaries, too.  I mean, take `Bonnie Scotland,&apos; with several good scenes sandwiched between the lachrymose bits with the whiney lead.  Then look at the highly Roach-edited `Swiss Miss,&apos; which butchers a L&amp;H song and makes us sit through Della Lind and Walter Woolf King (who is decent here, but a far cry from the love-to-hate-him Lasparri (sic))give me a dubbed Thelma and a nice helping of Mae any day.\n\nWhy complain and deride it?  It&apos;s a pleasant evening, with lots of merriment.  And it&apos;s Stan and Ollie in their prime, even if not in the best of their films.  We should be so lucky as to have another BG filming in Hollywood today.  Go jump on `The Big Noise&apos; or `Air Raid Wardens,&apos; if you just want to gripe.\n\nBut if you want some fun, pop BG into your VCR and prepare to laugh.",

The movie is visually hideous, but the script is astonishingly lively, and some members of the cast burst out at you. As the Shatneresque team leader, the Strobe, Thomas Haden Church is like a concentrated Swat team of extreme earnestness. And there is a lovely scene--not really funny, but you can feel the audience beaming at it--in which a mongoloid &quot;space orphan,&quot; dandled like a pinhead mascot through most of the movie, takes the stage at a techno nightclub and breakdances to &quot;Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me).&quot;"

What was done instead was extremely fast-paced bullet-point-like re-telling of the classic story. No suspense, no tension that was present at all stages in the book.\n\nThe screenplay sticks to the original dialogue almost verbatim. A serious mistake in my view: the director seems to be afraid of the book fans, and doesn&apos;t dare to touch anything in the original. But the original dialogue was backed by a lot of description of internal thinking of the heroes - which cannot be shown on the screen. The result - the storyline is flat and uninteresting, instead of the intriguing and fascinating story in the book.\n\nThe actors&apos; play is a total fiasco - except, maybe Strannik (&quot;Strider&quot;) - but his role is relatively simple. Everybody else looks like they&apos;re reading from a phone book - which probably has to do with the fact that the dialogues were left as-is, see above.\n\nI do appreciate the effort to create an &quot;exoplanet&quot; look of everyday things (cars, glasses, forks, plates, food, clothes etc). The things created would be unusable, but had the desired unusual look.\n\nOverall, disappointing, and leaves a taste of a missed opportunity.",

But, this is no different than any other actor. This was easily, Mr. Van Damme&apos;s best performance ever. No - this was one of the best performances of any actor - period. You, clearly, do not know great acting and directing when you see it. When Jean-Claude lost his wife - excuse me - one of the best scenes.\n\nPlease move on to a place where you belong .............\n\nBheart"

It&apos;s literally just Ki-duk, his camera and the main actress wandering the streets of Paris in the vein of one of those modern-day video blogs that have been popular since lockdown. While the historic vistas of France and Italy are always nice to see, Ki-duk really needed more means here and doesn&apos;t even have a muffler to reduce the wind noise. The main actress does her best in a near silent role, but the story feels made up on the hoof and although this runs only 70 minutes on it does test the patience.",

Yes there was mistakes or goofs &amp; most of the acting was terrible or very poor but i liked the urban hood setting &amp; the old school blaxploitatation feel it has &amp; the crazy funny killer clown Killjoy is actually a cool Horror villain &amp; i liked the weird chilled flow of the film with chillout R&apos;n&apos;B background music it&apos;s very cool.

HGL&apos;s budget seems to be a tad bigger this time around, though the acting is just as poor. In fact the two leads (Thomas Wood and Connie Mason) are both from &apos;Blood Feast&apos;, so that explains a lot. The plot in this one concerns a small town in the South that is celebrating its centenary by luring unsuspecting &quot;yankees&quot;, and basically torturing them to death. HGL doesn&apos;t spare us the gore, but the murders are done with such good humour that the movie ends up with an odd feel somewhere between &apos;The Beverly Hillbillies&apos; and &apos;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&apos;. This is a very silly movie obviously, but also very entertaining fun for those with a strong sense of the absurd."

      "reviewBody": "Magic happens, if you let it; and sometimes even fate or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- steps in to lend a hand.  But when it concerns love, and finding that special person you&apos;re going to spend the rest of your life with, should you risk tempting fate with a test of that love or what is seemingly meant to be, or should you just follow your apparent destiny and embrace it?  Such are the questions two people must face and answer in the romantic comedy/drama `Serendipity,&apos; directed by Peter Chelsom.  Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) is shopping for a gift for his girlfriend, and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) is looking for something for her boyfriend when they reach for the same pair of gloves on a rack at Bloomingdales.  And the wheels of fate are quickly turning.  Or are they? Jonathan and Sara proceed to spend the next few hours together, including a romantic interlude skating in New York&apos;s Central Park, and there are definite sparks flying between them.  For Jonathan, it&apos;s a significant emotional experience, and he realizes something has happened, that something has changed in his life; Sara feels the same, but being a true believer in destiny, she needs a sign that this is meant to be before she&apos;ll consider pursuing whatever it is that&apos;s just happened between them.  So she puts it to the test.  And for Jonathan, knowing only that her name is Sara, it&apos;s the beginning of an odyssey-- a quest-- to find true love with the woman he already knows in his heart of hearts that he wants to share his life with. For Sara, it&apos;s the beginning of a search for love, and for that one special person she knows is destined to be her soul mate forever.  They both find, however, that the path to pure love is filled with every obstacle the known universe could possibly place in their way.  And is the journey worth it? Well, in the end, it all comes down to what fate has predetermined.  Or does it?\n\n\tIn the tradition of such films as `Sleepless In Seattle&apos; and `You&apos;ve Got Mail,&apos; Chelsom has fashioned a truly romantic tale of two people who are absolutely destined to be together, no matter what.  And-- as the audience knows early on-- nothing less will be acceptable.  Hanks and Ryan may be missing, but the charismatic Cusack and the beguiling Beckinsale more than make up for it, carving out their own niche in the genre with this outing, and Chelsom has just enough of that Nora Ephron touch (including the use of music, matching the perfect song with every situation) to make it work.  The chances of things ever happening in real life the way they do in this movie are about twice as remote as winning the lottery, but who cares?  This is a heartwarming fable about love-- about the way we `want&apos; love to be-- and it&apos;s delivered with an endearing care that makes it emotionally involving, entertaining and a thoroughly satisfying experience.  And there&apos;s not a whole lot more you can ask of a movie, I think.\n\n\tCusack is so likable, and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility, that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning.  You want things to work out for this guy-- and Sara, as well; and, of course, you&apos;re pretty confident from the outset they are going to.  But along the way they make you feel something; they enable you to share the frustration as well as the elation that comes with discovering love, and perhaps finding that better part of yourself at the same time. And the fact that Cusack makes Jonathan so believable, and someone with whom you can identify, has more than a lot to do with it.  It&apos;s a quality performance from an actor with the flexibility and range to do just about anything, and who never disappoints.\n\n\tThe other half of the equation for success, of course, belongs to Beckinsale, who is not only beautiful, but a good actor who infuses her character with a touch of mystery and complexity that makes her winsome and interesting.  Like Cusack&apos;s Jonathan, Sara is someone you can root for; you want to see her get what she wants and what she deserves.  This isn&apos;t a perfect world we live in, and we all know it; but for Sara and Jonathan you want it to be.  There&apos;s a chemistry between the two of them, and they make it so easy for you to project your own feelings and desires into their situation, that there&apos;s no getting around it.  If they win, you win.  It&apos;s that simple.  And even though they take you over some rough spots along the way, it&apos;s a fun trip and Beckinsale and Cusack-- Sara and Jonathan-- make it a journey worth taking.\n\n\tThe supporting cast includes Molly Shannon, Jeremy Piven, Bridget Moynahan and Eugene Levy (who is terrific-- and hilarious-- as a sales clerk at Bloomingdales).  A handsome film that touches all the right nerves and pushes all the right buttons, `Serendipity&apos; has a gentle sensibility about it that addresses the notions of romance and love that reside within us all. And it&apos;s refreshingly presented in a way that is pure and inoffensive; and as such it allows you to open up and embrace something of value without having to apologize for it, and without implying you have to be `hip&apos; to appreciate it.  Because it&apos;s all about love and sharing love, which is something we can all use a little more of in this world we live in today. And that&apos;s the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",

Mozart&apos;s work, or the movie adaptation of it? Mozart of course is incredible. I love the opening scene, the closing scene and pretty much everything in between. My biggest problem, and I assume that this is true with opera in general is that once I passed the point that I had reached in familiarity from listening to a recording of it, the music was lost to me. I paid more attention to the words and what was going on in the plot than the music.\n\nAs for the movie adaptation, aside from it being very strange to watch and listen to an opera written more than 200 years ago on my modern television, I found it enjoyable. Yes, the preceding comment is true that the expressions were exaggerated and more fit for a stage but I don&apos;t feel they were inappropriate either. As far as sets and costumes and quality, I have very little basis of comparison, as I have not seen it on stage, or any opera for that matter.\n\nIn short, I found it to be very good, though I&apos;m probably one of the very few sixteen year olds who would agree with that.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in September 1984 after a Times Square screening.\n\n&quot;Exterminator 2&quot; is a silly and tiresome revenge actioner, unlikely to repeat the freak hit status of its 1980 predecessor.\n\nFormula, patterned after a successful line of Charles Bronson films, is to create audience antipathy against young street punks of mixed racial backgrounds, allowing a stalwart avenger to be motivated to wipe them out at intervals, with plenty of action. Mark Buntzman, who produced the original &quot;The Exterminator&quot;, here wears (and shares with William Sachs) too many hats, taking over James Glickenhaus&apos;s writing and directing assignments from #1 and ending up with a contradictory mishmash.\n\nReprising his title role as Vietnam vet Johnny Eastland, an uncomfortable Robert Ginty is supposedly spurred into renewed vigilante action when his flashdancing girlfriend Caroline (Deborah Geffner) is at first savagely beaten and crippled, and later murdered by he all-purpose punks, led by a messianic leader (&quot;I am the streets&quot;) X (Mario Van Peebles). However, the crudely constructed film has Ginty, in hismyhic steel helmet, army khakis and flamethrower uniform, randomly and unconvincingly incinerating punks rift from the outset, including X&apos;s brother.\n\nCrassly violating the &quot;lone avenger&quot; formula, Eastland is teamed with an old mate from Vietnam, Be Gee, your friendly neighborhood black garbage man who eagerly endorses Eastland&apos; murderous cleanup policy. Sole interesting element on view is the weird sight of Be Gee&apos;s vast Mack garbage truck, armored and refitted as a sort of tank with remote-control machine-gun turrets by Eastland for confrontations with punks, who meanwhile are trying to take over New York City via armored car robbery and peddling Mafia-supplied drugs.\n\nGinty has one good scene wherein he manhandles a punk for information, but generally, the sadisic element of the first film (which had him ingeniously feeding bad guys to a meat grinder, et.) has been toned down. Geffner gets to show her nude body and dancing ability, while acting honors go to Van Peebles, creating a solid physical presence with his male version of Grace Jones.\n\nTechnically, film adheres to an ugly look in keeping with its theme, though why it took such a huge crew (over 300 people are credited with behind-the-camea contributions) to ma=ke a B-picture is mighty strange. Only real sense of humor in this &quot;serious&quot; comic strip approach comes in the song titles: &quot;Exterminate Me (with Your Flame)&quot;, &quot;Shake It to Bake It&quot; and the ever-popular &quot;Return to CInder&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "POSITIVE REVIEW: Adapted from Marc Durin-Valois&apos; prize-winning novel Chamelle by Belgian director Hänsel, this is the beautiful and moving saga of a little family somewhere in Africa forced to leave home and struggle eastward across the desert with their livestock in search of water. Along the way they endure great loss, danger, cruelty, and heartbreak. This film dramatizes many of the demographic and human problems that face the African continent: drought, revolution, lawlessness, poverty. Hänsel&apos;s powerful visual storytelling makes all these things real to us, while bringing alive the drama of human beings. Images are striking, and so are the people, and all the actors are fine, particularly the father Rahn e played by Isaka Sawadogo and his little daughter Shasha played by Asma Nouman Aden. Music is used deftly and economically. This is committed narrative film-making at its best. It brings home major issues but never seems preachy or doctrinaire. At the end, what remains of the family winds up in a UN camp. &quot;This is my Pouzzi,&quot; says Sasha, using her pet name for her father. &quot;He looks sad because he has lost his camel.&quot; The viewer will remember a series of striking, pathetic tableaux. A heartrending and vividly told tale.\n\nNEGATIVE REVIEW: Shot in Djibouti, Hänsel&apos;s film attempts to be universal by being unspecific in locale and by casting the dialogue by all and sundry entirely in rather academic French. Everything is generic and sanitized. If the family is desperately short of water, how come they have full wardrobes of immaculately clean clothes and are perfectly clean themselves? At the outset Rahne meets another man who says they should travel together because it&apos;s safer that way. &quot;Yes,&quot; Rahne says, &quot;we will travel together. We will leave before dawn to take advantage of the coolness.&quot; It&apos;s stilted elementary primer language. Even religious phrases that sound Muslim, like &quot;God wishes it so,&quot; are said in French, when likely they would be said in Arabic. A bunch of wild looking outlaws speak the same academic French. An online viewer wrote that this is &quot;a romanticized film made by a middle aged western woman aimed at...middle aged western women&quot; and added, &quot;naturally in the end the main characters get saved by white people from the West.&quot; And this is true. Hänsel uses the authentic setting and real-looking African actors to make us naive westerners believe that we&apos;re watching something real, but it&apos;s a downbeat fairy tale, none of which is true to a specific and coherent whole. Sawadogo, by the way, has lived in Norway for the last fifteen years.",

The editing and sets were not great, but the story is what draws you in. The plot is fascinating, a multi-layered story. The film alternates between scenes from the present and about one week prior. Some may find that unnerving, but it is very well written.\n\nI recommend this film for anyone who likes mysteries or intelligent horror stories. I give it 7 stars and not 8 or 9 cause you see that it is very low budget and the first 10 minutes or so is slow and you really don&apos;t know what is happening. But when it picks up - it pulls you through with a big bang!",

The animated title character has been framed and now he is out to clear his name with the help of a human detective (Bob Hoskins).  Robert Zemeckis cemented his ability to make a film with this winner.  The special effects, which are remarkable, never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture.  Overlooked in 1988, but the best film from that weak year.  5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "John Carpenter&apos;s 1978 &apos;Halloween&apos; is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it&apos;s still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror&apos;s most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.\n\nWhich is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original &apos;Halloween&apos; is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. The exception however is &apos;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&apos;. It&apos;s not perfect and nowhere near as great as the original, but it&apos;s the only sequel that&apos;s above average, let alone good and by far the best since the original. It does a great job breathing fresh life into a series that had gotten stale as quick as one can down a can of coke gone flat and such a welcome addition after the badness of the fifth and sixth films. \n\n&apos;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&apos; has its flaws. It is too short and at times erratically paced, sometimes rushed and then taking a bit of time to get going after the opening. There is not enough breathing room for development of characterisation, which generally is shallow apart from the central relationship and the script tends to be weak (not unexpected, though actually it&apos;s far worse in the previous sequels, at least it sounds complete).\n\nOn the other hand, &apos;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&apos; is the best-looking of the sequels, the first half in particular being close in style to the autumnal look of the original, something that none of the previous sequels did. The editing is coherent, it&apos;s not shot too darkly and there is an eeriness to the setting which can be properly appreciated as a result. The music is a welcome return to being an asset than a drawback like in the previous two sequels. While not quite a character of its own like in the original, it adds to the atmosphere and enhances it.\n\nLuckily there&apos;s nowhere near as much unintentional camp, out of place humour or bizarre subplots or idea that muddle the story. Instead much of the film is fun and there is a tension, creepiness and suspense, even poignancy at times, that the previous sequels were sorely lacking in. The deaths are the most creative and shocking since those in the original, while the opening scene is unsettlingly tense and the ending is creepy and touching. The central relationship is handled quite well. \n\nAlthough the characters are underdeveloped, none of them are annoying and they do have enough personality to stop them from being too dull. The direction is in control of the material and is at least competent and often well above that, especially in the second half when the film really does come alive. Of the sequels, &apos;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&apos; is by quite some way the best acted, Jamie Lee Curtis&apos; wonderful performance being the film&apos;s best asset.\n\nIn summary, the best of the sequels/follow ups and worth the wait. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa is the story of Sunil (Shahrukh Khan), the girl he loves, Anna (Suchitra Krishnamurty) and the guy she loves, Chris (Deepak Tijori). Sunil, realizing the budding relationship between Anna and Chris decides to take things into his own hands by trying to create rifts between the two and taking advantage of the situations to woo Anna himself. Supporting these three are Sunil&apos;s family, his musical friends (look a little closer and you&apos;ll see Ashutosh Gowarikar among them) and also the local Father (Naseeruddin Shah) who acts as Sunil&apos;s mentor.\n\nThis may sound like a very simple and typical love triangle, which it is. What makes it different is Sunil. His character is one that is rarely seen in Indian cinema, yet not unfamiliar to us because we&apos;ve met hundreds of Sunils in our lifetime. We ourselves might be a Sunil. He is that real. He has no great physical strength (Shahrukh in 93? puny!), or great intelligence (he failed the same class several times)or great wealth (his father is a mechanic). He is a regular Joe trying to get the girl he loves.\n\nSunil happens to be Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&apos;s greatest asset. We see everything and everyone through his eyes which makes his world real to us. The things he does are things we might do when in love. What he ultimately does in the end might reflect on who many of us really are on the inside: simple people who love their family and friends.\n\nA lot of people believe Shahrukh Khan became an actor with Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge in &apos;95. The truth is that he was well on his way to becoming a legend in Indian cinema with this movie. He IS Sunil. He breathes life into the role making it much more than just a character in a story, he brings Sunil to life, he brings Sunil to us. He is brilliant. Just watch the film.",

What Kate doesn&apos;t know is that she&apos;s being watched by a secret society of modern day vampires. These folks want Kate to join them, and are absolutely committed to obtaining her membership!\n\nTHIRST is a unique vampire movie, in that its bloodsuckers are all part of a sophisticated cult / organization called The Hyma Brotherhood, that has a plan for mass exsanguination. Kate&apos;s importance to the group is explained, and the layout of their operation is ingenious. The vamps themselves are normal-looking, rather than bug-eyed monsters. Shirley Cameron and David Hemmings are especially good as two members with differing ideas on how to best handle the Kate situation. Henry Silva is also on board. You will probably never see a vampire movie as original as this one! Another early, Aussie gem..."

It proved just how starved movie-audiences were for pure escapist fluff, such as it was. Pillow Talk went on to be nominated for 5 Academy Awards. It won an Oscar for &quot;Best Screen-writing&quot;.\n\nPillow Talk starred Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Pairing these 2 stars together proved to be such a success that they eventually went on to make 2 other Romantic Comedies together, but neither of which turned out to be as magical as Pillow Talk.\n\nFeaturing some pretty snappy dialogue, energetic performances, lush photography, and high production values, Pillow Talk is certainly an all-round fun and very enjoyable 1950s Comedy.",

      "name": "Outstanding picture! Seeta, Geeta and the ever-unforgettable Hema Malini!",
      "reviewBody": "Seeta Aur Geeta is according to me one of the best comedy films ever made in India. Apart from its wonderful screenplay, exceptionally funny proceedings, and the fantastic blend of comedy, romance and action, there&apos;s another very good reason to watch it which is also the main reason: Hema Malini. Ramesh Sippy makes a wise choice by casting her as she brings the film to life with her natural charm and beauty. Without a doubt, the script is another winner, and technically the film was quite innovatory for the time. The result is a picture that is terribly entertaining and memorable.\n\nSeeta and Geeta, both played by Malini, are identical twin sisters who were separated at birth. 17 years later: Seeta lives unhappily with her paternal uncle and his cruel wife in her deceased parents&apos; mansion, and is literally treated like a slave, while Geeta, who was stolen by a gypsy couple at birth, lives happily a poor lifestyle with her mother. Seeta is presented as a shy, traditional and highly reticent girl, while Geeta is a bubbly, energetic, brave and vivacious girl who works as a street dancer to feed herself and in her free-time is a real prankster who indulges in playing marbles with kids.\n\nThe comedy of errors begins when Seeta, unable to tolerate her ill-fate any longer, runs away from home, and the two estranged sisters accidentally swap places. This is done through a series of scenes which are full of comedy and humour. The police station sequence is awesome, to say the least. The moment we see Geeta hanging on to the ceiling fan with such comfort is unforgettable. But the greatest fun happens in the big mansion, where the aunt, her brother and daughter think they can maltreat Seeta again. What they don&apos;t know is that it is not Seeta, but Geeta! And what happens then is such a hilarious show to watch.\n\nIt must be noted that it&apos;s not just about the comedy; the movie has depth even in the dramatic portions. Seeta&apos;s torture is successfully disturbing, and there you can see a great deal of dramatic tension which is often overlooked. Some of the scenes in which Geeta finally makes justice may be entertaining, but they are much more than just that. See Geeta&apos;s interaction with her grandmother, the moment she makes the old woman take her real place in the house, the moment she stands up for the servant when he gets physically abused, or the one when she breaks the norm by refusing to count the money brought by the lawyer, placing full trust in his services. You will understand what I&apos;m referring to.\n\nHema Malini, in one of her finest performances ever, is simply splendid and marvelous. She gets two completely different roles to play with very distinct temperaments and personalities (one is a dramatic role and the other is a comic one), and she plays them so brilliantly, skillfully and convincingly that it&apos;s impossible to believe it is one woman playing these two characters. As a kid I actually used to think these were two different women who were just similar looking. She is moving and compelling as Seeta, but it&apos;s the character of Geeta that remains with you forever, because it shows the most colourful shades of her personality and utilises her superb comic timing to the fullest.\n\nThe rest of the cast members, including Sanjeev Kumar and Dharmendra, support well. Kumar never ceased to impress with his natural ease and here he is very likable. Dharmendra does exceedingly well as the lonely drunkard. Roopesh Kumar is also well cast as the villain. The elderly women -- Pratima Devi as the grandmother and Radhika Rani as Geeta&apos;s foster mother -- are very good, but undoubtedly it is Manorama who stands out as the twins&apos; cruel, evil and hilarious aunt. Her plump, amusingly hypocritical, heavily made-up and caricaturish Kaushalia is according to me one of the most memorable and funny characters in Hindi cinema history. Manorama is just exceptional in a wonderfully acted comic role, which significantly contributes to making this film the classic that it is.\n\nR.D. Burman&apos;s music is outstanding. All the songs are lovely, from the happily exciting &quot;Oh Saathi Chal&quot; to the catchy &quot;Zindagi Hai Khel&quot; to the ballad &quot;Haan Ji Haan&quot;. And speaking of modern, the film portrays the modern-day India very well. Ramesh Sippy&apos;s direction is excellent, ditto for the cinematography, the editing and the action. The camera work and the stunts were definitely ahead of the times. The movie never gets boring; it is fast-paced, engaging and interesting. Many films with similar story lines have been made before and after, but frankly they all pale in comparison to this one. Seeta Aur Geeta is one of the best-made Indian films of its time, one of the most accomplished entertainers - a masterful work of timeless proportions.",

The theater was packed and after the movie started you could not hear a sound from the audience for the rest of the two hours besides two or three times when applause errupted.\n\nYou could feel that everybody in the audience really got the message.\n\nI only hope that Michael&apos;s parting words will come true and everybody will join his fight. As long as we are being led like pigs to the slaughter nothing will change. We have to stand up against the insurance companies, the exploiting employers, the greedy merchants, the predatory lenders. If we all say no, things will change.\n\nI will not be punished again for pre-existent conditions, car accidents caused by somebody else, retributions because somebody stole my wallet and I was punished. I will not fall buy trash anymore which breaks in a short time and cannot be repaired. I will not be talked into buying useless gimmicks which change every few months. etc.etc.\n\nThank you Michael Moore, without you, I would have lost hope a long time ago.",

      "reviewBody": "Taxi Driver (1954) : Brief Review -\n\nDev Anand and his wife Kalpana Kartik&apos;s chemistry saves Chetan Anand&apos;s run-of-the-mill romantic drama. There is one trivia about this film that some people know already, but still, I&apos;d like to share it again. Dev Anand and Kalpana were married during the lunch break while shooting for Taxi Driver in 1954. Now, that&apos;s an interesting one. Generally as well as logically. Their chemistry in the film showcases the love they share for each other, and that&apos;s the best thing about this film. Chetan Anand&apos;s Taxi Driver is a typical romantic drama with mainstream commercial elements, and most of them are too predictable. Taxi Driver wasn&apos;t supposed to be a philosophical film or a cult film at all, so all it does is justify its audience-friendly vision. Romance, drama, thrill, love triangle, action, happy ending, etc. Used to be the essential elements of any Hit film of that time, and Taxi Driver runs on the same fuel. Mangal is a taxi driver who enjoys his typical daily life that includes work, drinking, and a little bit of flirting with a club singer, Sylvie. One odd night, he saves Mala from two hoodlums and then takes her home. Both fall in love, but Mangal has to leave Mala for her own good. Dev Anand&apos;s Mangal is a regular street-type fella with no philosophies or principles in life. That&apos;s why he fails to generate sympathy. Surprisingly, Sylvie&apos;s character comes out as a clever and kind one, and you simply just can&apos;t hate her. Dev&apos;s chemistry with Kalpana is superb. Not just the romance, but they have some good comic and emotional scenes too. That scene when he transforms Mala into a male cleaner and the one when he leaves her outside Ratanlal&apos;s house is fantastic. I was expecting an intellectual climax, but Chetan Sir chose the commercial and ordinary way. Overall, a good flick for its time, but doesn&apos;t do anything outside of that.\n\nRATING - 6.5/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "An extremely violent thriller about a jaded cop including hair-rising scenes , gruesome crimes and breathtaking chases. This nail-biting thriller packs plot twists, noisy action, pursuits , shootouts, and continuous intrigue .An undercover cop, LAPD detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) , disillusioned by the death of his wife, is implicated in the murder of an officer and must struggle to clear himself. Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) always covers for Ludlow, as do even his somewhat jealous colleagues. Along the way , Tom is confronted by his former partner, Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) . After technically excessive violence against a vicious Korean gang during the liberation of kidnapped child sex slaves, Ludlow becomes the target of hotshot Internal Affairs captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie) , who feels passed-over after Wander&apos;s promotion to chief. But some members of the elite task force find themselves being taken down one by one . When Tom is wounded , at the Hospital he&apos;s healed by a particular nurse who turns out to be his girlfriend, Grace Garcia (Martha Higareda). Later on , Detective Tom Ludlow meets Detective Paul Diskant (Chris Evans) and both of them join forces to investigate the sinister events. Ludlow works his way through the twisted rungs of the police and the deadly streets of Los Angeles for answers that only lead to more questions. And other cops and members of drug gangs are also gunned down . Their City. Their Rules. No Prisoners.\n\nNice action film displays action-packed, thrills , fast-paced , shootouts , wild fighting images , police brutality and spectacular chase sequence in South Central . James Ellroy wrote the surprising screenplay in the mid-1990s with the same formula of his previous works and inspired by the O. J. Simpson trial. James Ellroy&apos;s script for Street Kings (2008) bears certain resemblance to the screenplays for L. A. Confidential (1997) and Dark Blue (2002) . It&apos;s a noir movie whose plot is really complex and twisted , the ordinary issue in which certain law enforcement members suspected of being corrupt who are slain one by one and a deranged cop is given a major murder case by a corrupt commander/supervisor who sends him on a wild goose chase looking for fictional suspects and/or pinning the crime on criminals with prior records, only to learn that his boss is the real culprit. While the film was praised for its acting performances, action sequences, and dark tone, the script was criticized for its clichés about police corruption. Keanu Reeves is nice giving an efficient acting as a ruthlessly efficient, unorthodox undercover cop and haunted by the death of his wife . Keanu even did all of his own stunts in the film with no stunt stand-in. And a fundamental fun is to guess which prestigious , famous actor appears here and there, showing his charm and acting skills, including the following : Hugh Laurie , Chris Evans, Cedric the Entertainer, Jay Mohr, Terry Crews , Naomie Harris, Common , John Corbett, Amaury Nolasco, Michael Monks , Clifton Powell , among otheres.\n\nThis bone-chilling motion picture was professionally directed by David Ayer , though it has too much dark scenes , and it was shot in grueling 42 days . Ayer is a prestigious writer and director with successes enough , writing or directing films as : Fury , SWAT , Training day , The Tax Collector , U-571 , Fast and furious saga, Suicide Squad , among others. The film is followed by an inferior sequel, ¨Street Kings 2: Motor city¨ (2011), released direct-to-video in 2011 by Chris Fisher with Ray Liotta , Shawn Hatosy , Scott Norman , Clifton Powell, Kevin Chapman . Rating : 6.5/10 . Decent thriller.",

Thats not to say the previous films did not have &apos;mess with your head&apos; factor, They certainly did. However they managed it on a level that wasn&apos;t thought out, it came across more as a by-product of the film. You get to see pinhead about once for a proper scene and its nothing to write home about.\n\nI would not bother even renting this film if you started out as a big fan of the first few. If you&apos;re easily scared they get it, why not.",

Heck, I couldn&apos;t manage to watch the film even while fast forwarding half the scenes, that&apos;s how bad this was. Absolutely zero storyline and a waste of talent from all the notables that were cast. The comedy scenes were pathetic and the entire movie was so predictable that even a five year old could have told you what happened next. And the villain, less said the better. Maybe you can watch the film to see how hopeless it is. Ravi Teja needs to select his roles more properly or else he will be a baladoor for his entire life. 4/10.",

Except the magnificent photography, everything appears dumb and there&apos;s no envy to know what will happen at these &quot;medium&quot; actors. Moreover, the dialogs are minimalists. The famous question &quot;where are the children&quot; is repeated so often it looks like a farce. Believe me, it&apos;s a pure waste of time (concerning the plot), and 3 hours is a long long time. Certainly the real reason of this box-office total mess !",

Franco Nero would not be the first name that comes to mind for such a production (nor the second, or third), but he does very well as the Terrence Hill stand-in; his wide blue-eyed stare conveys both innocence and mischief, and he does fine in the slapstick sequences too. His &quot;hero&quot; role is complemented by a diverse bunch of side characters, not well-known but well-cast. The sets and camera-work are good, too. The music covers the complete gamut of italo-westerns and then a bit more, a little crazy like the whole movie. The pacing is quick, there&apos;s not a single boring moment in Cipolla Colt.\n\nThe only drawback to this otherwise nice comedy is the generic plot (an oil magnate trying to grab poor farmer&apos;s land); with action that absurd the movie would have deserved some crazier story, too. Apart from that, recommended for anyone not put off by absurd humour.",

      "reviewBody": "Lina Wertmuller had a brief moment in the spotlight back in the mid-seventies, mostly due to the impact of three of her films: &quot;Love and Anarchy,&quot; &quot;Swept Away,&quot; and &quot;Seven Beauties.&quot; Although her career took a nose-dive shortly thereafter, &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; still stands as her best film, and also one of the best films of its era.\n\nGiancarlo Giannini gives a compelling and hilarious performance as Pasqualino Settebellezze, an Italian hood who is sent to prison after killing his sister&apos;s lover. He fakes insanity, gets sent to an institution, escapes by joining the military, deserts, gets caught, and is put in a concentration camp. There, he seduces his grotesque female camp commander in order to survive. Giannini makes his character wholly believable, and his presence on-screen (in nearly every scene) keeps the story going from one plot twist to the next. His character has a bumbling, comic presence to him, but also a certain amount of craft and sophistication.\n\nWertmuller creates a story that works both as slapstick and anti-war drama. Her direction is tight and controlled, and she doesn&apos;t flinch away from depicting the brutalities of Nazism. Parts of the film may seem like forerunners of the &quot;gross-out&quot; gags that have populated cinema in recent years, but these moments are actually used to show how the Nazis degraded ordinary innocents and demoralized the world around them. The most interesting aspect of the story is the way Wertmuller compares Hitler&apos;s tactics to those of the underground mafia; the Nazis, in the end, come off as hypocritical for persecuting Pasqualino for his crimes.",

      "reviewBody": "I had watched the original with friends before. What attracted it to us was the way the movie was being put across &quot;to avoid fainting keep repeating it&apos;s just a movie&quot; etc. We loved horror and anything just generally shocking it was the most fun along with comedy&apos;s you could have with friends!. Well it certainly did not let anyone one of us down it was pretty insane?! shall we say. Either way a truly great piece of horror beyond what any of us had seen at the time.\n\nWhen i heard about This Re-make i was not so much excited but anxious to see how they would handle the story and the scenes that would be necessary to tell it to the best of it&apos;s ability.\n\nI was impressed.\n\nI knew straight away it would be reasonably mild compared to the first one it had to be , to be watchable in cinemas in order to make money. And for the most part it was. However it still kept that vital shock value the gore (the blood &amp; guts) were handled perfectly it was like the hills have eyes re-make in the sense you saw what was happening the camera never once did one of those annoying wall shots were you see the blood splatter! when a knife went in or a bullet etc. it went in and you saw it. Well with a horror film that&apos;s half the battle straight away.\n\nObviously you probably know this film is centred around a group of convicts who are a perfect example of a human being with no soul or heart. And this even better than the first one in my opinion is displayed amazingly. In this film you really get the feeling that these guys would do anything to any human being in the world and would not feel one bit of remorse for there actions. I would even go as far as to say out of every film i&apos;ve ever watched these have to be some of the scariest people i&apos;ve seen on the silver screen. It all adds to the great experience.\n\nThe &quot;Rape&quot; scene/scenes are also what this film is pretty famous for and i was interested to see how they would handle this films such scenes. I thought it was handled pretty well. What this film hits straight on the head is the atmosphere the music and every aspect of the film combined just build up to exploding point then it happens. It was like nothing i&apos;d experienced in a cinema before the place was packed out with what was to be honest a perfect testing range for the film there were people of my age (18) all the way to what i would have said was about 70-ish. As the scenes built up and up the piercing sounds of the girls screams , the actions taking place on screen and everything accumulated into one terrifying experience. I looked round the once rowdy room to find everyone silent and i could just feel it someone had to walk out.\n\nAnd they did.\n\nFor the first time in my life a film was that shocking that as many as 10 people walked out and couldn&apos;t come back. That is what horror is meant to do!. So at this point Last House had already scored high marks with me it had stayed as true to the original as it could have. (There was also someone crying behind us!).\n\nThis film splits the story 50/50.\n\nThe first half is horrible it is meant to shock and appaul the audience so that when the second kicks in it satisfies all!. And god does it never before has revenge felt so right. People again were re-acting to the film again in a way i&apos;d never seen people were clapping chants &quot;get in&quot; , &quot;have it&quot; &quot;go on&quot; and cheering. Admitadley by the younger members of the audience but non the less a great re-action. In my eyes this film was just as perfect as this re-make could have been it had it all. And it was one of the first films i&apos;d seen in along time that was almost more than a film it was a genuine experience.\n\nOh and you&apos;d be surprised to know the acting was actually very well done i wouldn&apos;t have changed it at all t be honest again pleasantly surprised.\n\nOnly things that this film down was the fact that it&apos;s still a pointless story and if not for the shock factor couldn&apos;t possibly be even an average film!. so I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s a 7 from me which is still good for a horror film non the less.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely one of the better horror re-makes and one everyone will have a load of fun watching what more can you ask for in this day and age!.",

Bob Walter (1897) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nThree early films from Gaumont Studios and director Alice Guy. The first film, THE FISHERMAN AT THE STREAM has a group of boys playing a prank on a fisherman by pushing him into the water. BATHING IN A STREAM, apparently shot at the same time as our first film, has the boys taking a bath in that stream while SERPENTINE DANCE BY MME. BOB WALTER, running the longest at 107-seconds, is pretty much a direct remake of ANNABELLE SERPENTINE DANCE from Edison. Out of the three films from this year in Kino&apos;s collection, the first one is probably the best but none of them really feature Guy breaking out onto her own as all three seem to &quot;borrow&quot; a lot of previous films from Melies and Edison. The third film is probably the weakest of the bunch as we&apos;ve seen in from various studios and it has probably already grown quite tiresome even in this early part of cinema, although people back then were obviously eating it up."

      "reviewBody": "The first version of The Little Shop of Horrors, long before the Broadway musical and Frank Oz&apos;s musical/horror/comedy, is one of the primary examples of shoe-string movie-making. Shoe-string, of course, refers mostly to the budget, and this possibly ranks above others like Clerks, Slacker, Night of the Living Dead and Blair Witch in order to put it together so quickly. And yet for all of its little slip-ups and deranged moments of comedy, it does work for what its worth. Not that it doesn&apos;t show that the film was made in two days, but on those terms of extremely low-budget, go-for-broke B-movie-making, Roger Corman as a director has quite a nifty effort here. The story is similar to a fairy-tale (a darkly comic one to be sure, like one of the Fractures Fairy tales from the old Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle show), in how Seymour (Jonathan Haze, perfect as an awkward, easily shockable little guy) tries to nurture a plant to earn the affections of Audrey (Jackie Joseph). But then the plant turns into a meat-eater, to put it that way, and from there Charles Griffith&apos;s script goes into wild comic turns where he now has to figure out how to take care of the plant before it &apos;takes care&apos; of him. Some scenes are less notable than others, and sometimes the cheesiness of it all (just look at the plant itself for proof enough) can be wearisome. But Corman keeps the atmosphere with a giddy amount of late 50s &apos;shlock&apos;, and some scenes stand the test of time as the best of their B-movie status. Tops go to the 2nd film appearance from Nicholson as the most psychotic of the bunch, as a &apos;chipper&apos; fetishist who gets off on getting his wretched teeth worked on- it&apos;s a masterpiece of a scene with cartoonish action, innuendo and crazy looks from a 23 year old Nicholson. Worth checking out, maybe more than once, and you&apos;re likely to find it (appropriately) in the cheapest lot of DVDs and videos at your local store.",

      "reviewBody": "If you can overlook the bad dubbing and sometimes barebones production values (a dragon toward the end is particularly unfortunate), this is a completely charming version of the familiar tale. It was filmed on the grounds of an actual palace in Austria, and the director also plays the King. All of the actors are convincing and committed to their roles,never &quot;playing down&quot; to the material or snickering at it in a shared joke with the audience, as so often happens in our more cynical era. Among the more atmospheric scenes: the young queen&apos;s meeting with the wicked fairy early on; the exodus of the twelve good fairies from the depths of the lake; the wicked fairy putting the whole palace to sleep, and so on. This film manages to capture a naive sense of &quot;long ago and far away&quot; that is wholly and distressingly absent from more recent attempts at live-action fairy tales, like Duvall&apos;s Faerie Tale Theatre and the lamentable Golan-Globus productions, which substitute modern-day smart-aleckiness and prosaic scripts for the true magic that films have always been capable of. This film was one of a series based on the better-known Grimm&apos;s tales that was filmed in West Germany in the 1950&apos;s, which perhaps accounts for the less-than-sumptuous settings; post-war Germany was not exactly overflowing with &quot;filthy lucre&quot;. For those who like a little magic and poetry with their fairy tales, however, these films are just what the doctor ordered. They are available from amazon deutschland on Region 2 DVDs, but I don&apos;t think they are subtitled.",

They delight in being astonished by singular customs, strange habits and alluring scenery. &quot;Prem Sanyas&quot; delivers all this and will enlighten the most curious of the long haired people as it is an exotic film with curious origins ( a German-Indian film production ) . It narrates the story of Buddha ( a kind of Luther for the people of that part of the world ) and his childhood and youth at the palace of his father where the young man is kept secluded in a kind of golden prison, carefully shielded against such sorrows of the world as poverty, illness and all those other terrible things that this German Count knows thanks to some interesting articles read in &quot;The Aristocratic Und Teutonic Encyclopaedia About The World Outside The Schlöss&quot;.\n\nThe film, in addition to depicting Buddha&apos;s life, also functions as a kind of documentary about those exotic habits and customs of Indian tradition. It is a very beautiful film with plenty of dazzling, splendorous images filmed in incredible settings and with superb cinematography, bewitching the audience from the very start of the film. It may be a German film co-production, but the actors are all Indian. There is respect and admiration for this culture so different from the West. The director avoids typical Western manipulation and its tendency to be merely picturesque and that&apos;s the most important achievement of this film.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must return back to Deutsch land from India but this time this aristocrat won&apos;t travel by elegant carriage but by elephant.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",

Obviously the only previous reviewer was watching a different movie because a lot of his facts are incorrect. &quot;High Stakes&quot; is a terrific character driven story about flawed characters, but really intriguing characters. It is sort of along the lines of &quot;After Hours&quot; with a bit of &quot;Something Wild&quot; . The acting is way, way, above the normal for a low budget dramatic thriller. Sally Kirkland plays a single mother stripper/hooker and is totally a free spirit. She becomes involved with Robert Lupone, a Wall Street tycoon in a weekend of kidnapping and murder. He is the ultimate risk taker winning or losing millions in the stock market, and his showdown game of Russian roulette with Kirklands pimp, an amazing performance by Richard Lynch, is extremely tense. Other than at times getting a bit talky, the film has few faults, and will be &quot;pure gold&quot; to viewers willing to take a risk on it. - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "This is a terrific movie that reminds one what we lost when Debra Winger slowed down her movie-making. She gives an honest, heartfelt performance as an investigator chasing a woman who marries rich and whose husbands wind up dead every time. The widow then remakes her appearance, gets a new identity, and dupes another man. Only Winger is convinced that this trail of murders is the work of one woman.\n\nEventually she catches up with this black widow (Theresa Russell) and the two hang out together in Hawaii. The Russell character likes the danger - she knows Winger is after her, and after trying to kill her during a scuba dive, saves her at the last minute.\n\nMy favorite scene with Winger is the one in which she almost tells Nicol Williamson the truth about his bride. She stands and stares at him - she knows he&apos;s going to die, she knows he won&apos;t believe her - you can see every thought in her head until, regretfully, she leaves.\n\nTheresa Russell has the right detachment for this role. One suspects the character is a real man-hater and is, in fact, attracted to Winger. Winger is admiring of Russell&apos;s constant flirtation with danger. This is a complex relationship that the two play out. The finale is not up to the standard of the rest of the film, but I still highly recommend it.",

As such, for the spaghetti western fan, it is a welcome seasonal alternative to watching &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life,&quot; or the latest Moron Clause movie on your local big screen or cable movie channel.\n\nGiuliano Gemma does a fine job, as usual, portraying the protagonist of the film, and Fernando Sancho is even better as &quot;Sancho,&quot; the Mexican bandit. Nieves Navarro is breathtaking as &quot;Dolores,&quot; the female bandit who becomes romantically involved with one of her hostages.\n\nThe production is above-average for a euro-western, and the film has an engaging storyline with lots of action and suspense. Add to that a great music score by Ennio Morricone, and you definitely have a winning combination that spaghetti fans will be sure to enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "The film&apos;s first half isn&apos;t bad, except for the prologue, which isn&apos;t needed. A youthful, photogenic guy with big dreams, accompanied by his photogenic girlfriend, uses a skimpy boat to look for sunken treasure beneath the clear, blue waters off the Bahamas.\n\nThe visuals are dazzling, with bright, vivid colors, and some terrific underwater photography that captures images of real sharks and real fish, not fake CGI effects. The plot stays slow, lazy, and realistic. The script then brings in an additional couple, turning the story into a semi-ensemble character setup. As the plot develops, our two photogenic couples find some interesting stuff beneath the waves, which revs up the tension and conflict, and presents characters with moral dilemmas.\n\nBut the second half deteriorates into your typical Hollywood assembly-line action flick, with a whole series of super fast edit sequences and silly, totally unrealistic, out-of-control plot points spurred on by peripheral characters that detract enormously from the two couples. Frenetic action, accompanied by irritatingly frenetic background music, ruins the second half, and makes a mockery of the story&apos;s premise.\n\nActing is okay, I guess, given that this is a highly physical film wherein physical attractiveness and agility probably mean more than subtle theatrical skills. If there&apos;s a weakness here it&apos;s Scott Caan, whose cocky Bryce comes across as a total jerk, with nary a redeeming quality.\n\n&quot;Into The Blue&quot; is very easy to judge. It contains wonderful cinematography, especially the underwater segments. And the strong visuals get support from impressive sound effects. But the story, though it begins well, collapses in the second half. The script is to blame. And yet I can&apos;t help but think that the real villain here is some Hollywood producer, typically underestimating the intelligence of viewers, who thinks that the story doesn&apos;t really matter if there&apos;s enough eye candy and explosive, mind-blowing action."

The twists/turns in this movie are done really well and the ending defied my expectations. While it was a bit slow a few times, I thought that it was ultimately worth going through. At times it was creepy and makes you feel uncomfortable yet at other times it was beautiful and had impressive acting as well. All 3-4 of the main cast did great!! I loved the music in the more intense scenes as well, and whatever sound effects they used that weren&apos;t quite music but worked well subtly enhancing the mood. It was a modern-day Blade Runner!",

Dana Ashbrook is very amusing as the leather clad boyfriend from hell.  But Matthew Perry is not particularly convincing as the all too perfect Yale college boy.  Tony Danza seems to be treating the whole exercise like an extended version of a Who&apos;s the Boss? episode, which is probably why he was given the part.  Although it&apos;s not very original, and similar theme films have done it much better, it&apos;s still not a bad effort.  At least it was not boring.",

      "reviewBody": "For me there&apos;s nothing better than a film about the affairs of exotic people from other lands that is full of spirited music, no matter how flimsy the plot.  &quot;Vengo&quot; is an exemplary case.  It is the latest in a series of films about Romany people and their music made by Tony Gatlif.  He brings impeccable credentials to the task: born in Algeria, raised in Marseille, his mother is Roma and his father a Berber.  His best known film is the 1993 homage to Roma music, &quot;Latcho Drom&quot; (Safe Journey), which I have yet to see. &quot;Vengo&quot; is set in Andalusia, in southern Spain, in the city of Seville and surrounding villages.  Here a rich tradition of Berber, Romany and Jewish origins has shaped the culture and given the world a distinctive music: flamenco.  This film is best viewed as a flamenco concert featuring a number of different singers, instrumentalists, dancers and ensembles, most of whom are outrageously good.  The musical numbers are connected by an insubstantial narrative, a loosely unfolding story of a blood feud, a dialectic of deaths, between two rural Roma families.  Caco (the flamenco dancer, Antonio Canales, who doesn&apos;t get to dance at all here) is a bereaved nightclub owner and heavy boozer whose teenage daughter was killed by members of the Caravaca family.  In return Caco&apos;s brother Mario killed a Caravaca man and is hiding in Morocco. The Caravacas now demand their turn for revenge and, in Mario&apos;s absence, let out word that they plan to murder Mario&apos;s son, Diego (Orestes Villason Rodriguez), a 20-something man who suffers from cerebral palsy.  Caco dearly loves and dotes on Diego, his nephew, and is set into a crazed state by this news.  The story moves toward a tragic sacrificial climax.  The plot does serve to convey the essential truth that grounds the passion of these people: that suffering and death itself are inevitable counterpoints to love and family loyalty.  This backdrop gives embodiment to the deep emotions expressed in the music. There is also a single very humorous scene featuring cells phones, perhaps the funniest bit about these obnoxious instruments in all of filmdom. The turn contributed by Rodriguez (as Diego) is impressive; it is welcome indeed to see a person with cerebral palsy act a major role, especially when the performance is built much more on humanity than on handicap.

      "reviewBody": "I just watched this movie, and I can fairly say that the review that has been written is NOT the correct one. This movie is completely different and has nothing to do with a giant octopus! For me, I was really disappointed about this, because I had read the review and thought this was definitely a movie for me. I am a big fan of giant-kick-ass-monster-flicks. But boy was I in for a surprise.\n\nThis movie is very very weird, and it indeed is a style the director Gou Suzuki has adopted to his creations. I watched this movie on a tape, with no subtitles at all. And fair to say my Japanese is not the best. Therefor i have with out a doubt missed a lot in this movie. But from just watching the scenes and the acting, this is not a very good movie. It jumps way to fast from one scene to another, and there doesn&apos;t seem to be an actual plot, other than a guy who kills people for the Yakuza. But as I said, i watched this with no subs, so i could be wrong.\n\nBut I have given this a low rating, as I was very disappointed in the movie. Not only did i expect something completely different, but the picture, acting and scenes in general were to the point of being ridicules. I would very much like to watch this movie again with subs on, in order to get the story and all, but there is no doubt this movie is not one of my favorites, not will it ever be.\n\nActually, the reason I am writing this review is, so that others who may be looking for this movie, don&apos;t get the same surprise as me. It took me 3 years to find this movie and watch it, because it just cant be found anywhere. I have seen some people look for this movie, and I have been one of them. I just wanted to tell people, that his is not a giant squid movie. It does have horror elements in it, and a small amount of gore, but nothing special. Not compared to what Japan has produced of gore flicks over the year.\n\nMy advice, watch something els.... and don&apos;t read the first review posted for this movie! He has gotten it all wrong, and has with out a doubt not seen this movie at all. I can only guess that the movie he saw was the American Octopus movie, that indeed has a giant squid in it. This one however does NOT!",

      "reviewBody": "Führer Ex is a challenging, harsh, and intensely involving tale of the course of friendship of two young lads living in the &apos;prison&apos; of Communist East Germany in 1986. Based on fact (Ingo Hasselbach&apos;s book &apos;Die Abrechnng&apos; adapted for the screen by Douglas Graham and director Winfried Bonengel), this story relates the changes that occur in the close friendship of two boys torn by the confinement of the East German Communists vs the Western freedom of West Germany and the countries not under Communist control. It informs us about that transition with the fall of the Berlin wall and the subsequent adjustment to the new form of life East Germans found beyond the crumbled wall.\n\nHeiko (Christian Blümel) is fair-haired, virginal, nice guy who longs for adventure (and more) with his idolized friend Tommy (Aaron Hildebrand), an edgy guy unafraid to get into a bit of trouble (Tommy is arrested for a minor crime and is released from jail shaved and tattooed). The two dream of escaping their rigid lives and fleeing to Australia. Tommy talks Heiko into running the risk of actual escape and together they break through the wires and walls that confine them but are apprehended in their attempt and sentenced to prison in a cruel Communist prison where they are separated, Tommy joining a &apos;neo-nazi&apos; group and Heiko falling under the &apos;protection&apos; of a fellow prisoner who eventually rapes him. The two finally are able to talk and plan a mutual escape, hopefully placing themselves in boxes to be transported to freedom. Tommy succeeds; Heiko doesn&apos;t and remains in prison.\n\nFlash forward to 1989 and the Berlin wall is down. Tommy is living a comfortable life in the new Berlin and encounters Heiko in a true Neo-Nazi meeting that Heiko is leading. The tables have turned - Heiko is the miscreant and Tommy is the good guy. Convinced that Tommy is a traitor to the ideals of Heiko&apos;s political interests, Heiko surfaces all of the hate that brewed in prison and is focused on unjust governments. An event occurs that alters their friendship and Heiko is forced to see that varying political climes and convictions pale in the value of treasured friends.\n\nThe film is well paced and the acting is excellent. There are gaps in the script storyline that result in some confusion for the viewer, but the overall impact of the &apos;biopic&apos; nature of the movie is powerful and deserves attention. It is particularly fitting that this film comes out of Germany, as though it may be a purging of sorts over the initial division of East vs West Berlin. And forgetting about the political aspects of the story, this is a powerful document on the importance of commitment to long-term friends. Recommended. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "As you all know, with PRIMER, Shane Carruth announced himself to the world as a naturally gifted talent, one who could rival the likes of James Cameron. Of course, it never happened as he struggled to get his second film off the ground. \n\nNine years after PRIMER Shane Carruth&apos;s long awaited second film is as dense as expected, with an impossible to understand third act that still manages to intrigue due to its sheer technical mastery. With UPSTREAM COLOR Carruth proves he is not a one-shot wonder. He also proves he is the ultimate NYC and L.A. art-film director incapable of adapting to more mainstream story telling. \n\nMuch has been written about the plot so I will not get into the specifics here. What I will say is that I think Carruth purposely holds critical information from his films as a way to challenge viewers and force them to think. This is admirable. But in the end, a bit frustrating because with just a few answers both PRIMER and now UPSTREAM COLOR would be fit for the masses without compromising artistic integrity. \n\nThe film made sense to me for about an hour and then it started to slip away. Like with Primer, I just lost my footing and could not gain hold. Amazingly enough, I still enjoyed the experience and was never bored, In fact, at times I was held in genuine suspense. \n\nThe third act has been described as 30 minutes without dialog and that simply is not true. There are numerous sequences without dialog and about halfway through we get a major sequence of events told with visuals and music. Then we have some more conventional filmmaking (conventional is really not the right word) followed by what I think might be around 15 minutes of dialog free visuals. The ending makes no sense to me, but I will see the film again and hope to sort it out. \n\nCarruth designed the sound and composed the music and let me tell you, he hit both out of the park. The man could work scoring films and make a great living. The same goes for his sound design. \n\nI watched the film at IFC in New York City and they have a pretty good sound system. What they don&apos;t have is a great screen. It might be the proper widescreen aspect ratio, but the images appeared darker in sections and that harmed Carruth&apos;s amazing visuals, rumored to have been captured with a hacked $700 Pansonic DSLR (the GH2). The image is akin to a RED or Alexa and throughout Carruth plays with shallow depths of field. This results in some shots missing the sharply focused mark, but for the most part the visuals shine. This film proves you do not need Hollywood style lighting and equipment to make Hollywood level films. \n\nThe Blu-Ray will be out in May and I have already put it on order at Amazon. There is no question in my mind that by year&apos;s end I will have sat through UPSTREAM COLOR numerous times. \n\nI look forward to Carruth&apos;s next film, but with the hope for a little more clarity in his narrative.",

      "reviewBody": "The life story of Serge Gainsbourg had to be filmed, and as he&apos;s one of the famous Frenchmen who aren&apos;t in fact Belgian, it&apos;s only a surprise that it took so long. That his life spanned the Nazi occupation to the rise of Disco would stretch credibility if this were fiction, but as it&apos;s all more or less true the director, who is already an accomplished graphic artist, manages to lift it to the level of slightly absurd fiction. Mixing in animation, self-consciously stagey sets and a life-sized puppet as Gainsbourg&apos;s dreaded alter ego.\n\nEven the sordid lowlife is given the big treatment, and the early days in the garret look unashamedly glamorous as they would if re-imagined for an opera set or a Salvador Dali dream sequence, as director Joann Sfar lays it on with a trowel. \n\nThe episodic nature of the story gives it a rather patchy feel though, and I couldn&apos;t help thinking that one or two episodes, especially the cute Hollywood-style musical scene with Brigitte Bardot, could have been shorter. Bardot was just one of the high-profile women Gainsbourg captured, and so was the muse of the existentialists, Juliette Greco.The casting is pretty uncanny with the possible exception of Greco, who was never that model-thin. \n\nGainsbourg has always been, at least outside France, more famous for being cool than for his music. But his reworking of La Marseillaise which so upset the rightwing patriots of the Seventies was nothing but excellent. I&apos;ll go back just to hear that Sly and Robbie riddim one more time.\n\nQuite a substantial feast but it&apos;s worth building up an appetite in advance. And of course, you get Jane Birkin and... That Song.",

We also have the obligatory black actor as the senior Naval officer. No problem there, but will somebody please tell Asylum that Admirals do not tool around in destroyers, and that if you are going to film the Admiral on the bridge in open sea, it would be good not to have trees and land visible out the non-military window of the bridge they are filming on.

Their life changes when they take in a boarder/student by the name of Brahms, ROBERT WALKER, who immediately falls in love with Clara.\n\nWhile she makes a successful career as a pianist, her husband is less successful in pursuing his serious work as a composer. The story chronicles the highs and lows of their marriage as they struggle to raise seven or eight children while juggling their professional lives. Whether the romantic angle with Brahms falling deeply in love with Clara is accurate or not, I don&apos;t know. I&apos;ll have to read more about them to get the full picture, but it makes for an interesting romantic drama with lots of classical music, courtesy of Rubenstein at the piano.\n\nAn unusual film for Katharine Hepburn, who does beautifully at the keyboard looking as though she&apos;s really playing the instrument, as well as Henry Daniell as Franz Liszt who is quite adept at the fingering.\n\nGood performances throughout, but I suspect that it&apos;s a film for classical music lovers only.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie by Eldar Ryazanov surpassed my expectations. It really is quite an experience to see how Larissa&apos;s life unfolds; how she is coveted by men old and young, rich and poor... And yet every turn of events leaves a much bitter taste on her. It seems like if tears were a permanent mark of every Russian woman, like if, by definition, no woman would dare to call herself Russian without ever tasting the bitterness of life.\n\nRyazanov is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors. Though here I may be coming late, since he actually achieved fame and glory during Soviet time, a long gone era. Anyway, his &quot;Zhestokij Romans&quot; or &quot;A cruel Romance&quot; tells a tale which seems to me timeless.\n\nConsider the plot of a very beautiful young woman, whose life ahead is full of promise.. But consider also that this girl&apos;s life is actually torn apart by events which seem (apparently) out of her immediate control, like if fate was conspiring against her at every other corner. Even her mother, willingly or not, at some point &quot;sells&quot; her -though like every other mother she blindly believes doing what&apos;s best for her daughter&apos;s future. Zhestokij Romans is sinonimous to drama: just watch the final scene, which is so powerful, telling and poetic...\n\nI especially enjoyed the Gipsy scenes. All that dancing, joy and vodka were very moving in this film. Just as Yugoslav director Emir Kosturica has immortalised the Gipsy people (i.e. &quot;Underground&quot;) we also see in &quot;Zhestokij&quot; droves of joyful Gipsies carrying everywhere they go that sound which is at the same time melancholic and joyous. Some other scenes reminded me of &quot;Svadba&quot; (Pavel Lounguine) a film which also features lots of partying and rivers of vodka despite the imminent disgrace and bitterness of life. I even found some parallels with &quot;Luna Papa&quot; another film from the former Soviet republics in which a young and pretty girl has to rapidly mature and leap from childhood into adulthood.\n\nThe Gipsy scenes also served as a very effective contrast between joy and doom. While they kept dancing, tragedy was occurring elsewhere. It&apos;s like they say: one man&apos;s happiness is another man&apos;s suffering.\n\nThat&apos;s why I consider this movie to be &quot;Timeless&quot;. That&apos;s why I consider the last scene a gem of cinema, like anything I&apos;ve seen before. Our lovely Larissa is embarked in that permanent quest for real love and affection."

      "reviewBody": "A very appealing cast is left with little to work with in &quot;First Sunday,&quot; a manufactured comedy whose script fails to rise to the level of its actors. Desperate for some quick cash, Durell and LeeJohn come up with a scheme to break into a local church and carry off the fund earmarked for the construction of a new building. Unfortunately, this seemingly simple robbery quickly turns into a complicated hostage situation when a dozen or so of the most prominent church members unexpectedly show up on the scene.\n\n&quot;First Friday&quot; does elicit a few hearty laughs, due, in large part, to its game cast and the occasional funny line scattered in and amongst the numerous clunkers. Ice Cube effectively plays straight man to Tracy Morgan&apos;s endearingly bumbling sidekick, and they, together with the other actors, help to comprise a fine comic ensemble. The problem lies in a screenplay which often goes for the obvious joke over something truly original or clever, and which pours on the syrup to alarming proportions near the end just to ensure the movie its status as a morally upright, &quot;feel-good&quot; comedy.\n\nIt&apos;s a harmless enough little diversion if you have some time to kill, but the company is far more appetizing than what it is they&apos;re dishing up.",

A prolonged hatchet attack on an elderly woman is perhaps the film&apos;s most nauseating moment (although as this particular spot of carnage escalates, the somewhat iffy CGI makes it slightly less effective). \n\nYes, Boll sure knows how to upset and disturb; all he needs to do now is perfect telling a decent story (one that isn&apos;t so obviously flawed), hire a decent lighting technician (some scenes were way too dark), and he might be able to silence his critics without having to punch their lights out.\n\n4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",

It is involving and creepy. David Dukes turns in a terrific performance as the killer. The problem comes in the sub-plot with Faye Dunaway as Frank&apos;s dying wife. Every 10 or 15 minutes the film comes to a screeching halt so Frank can visit Faye in the hospital. Faye must have been desperate to work with Frank since she literally spends the entire film in a hospital bed. It&apos;s a needless distraction to the main plot.\n\nStill the film is worth watching. Frank is at his gritty best as his whole world falls apart in front of his eyes. The film also does one other good thing. It erased the possibility that the awful &quot;Dirty Dingus Magee&quot; would be his last starring role.",

      "reviewBody": "Seymour is a lonely nondescript man who lives by himself and works in the photo developing lab in a large mall.  The only bit of cheer in his day is to develop very good photos in his lab, and he takes great pride in his work. His favourite customers are the Yorkin&apos;s, who have a son and regularly develop pictures.  Seymour&apos;s like for this family goes beyond `like&apos; and he feels part of their family and has all their pictures on his wall.  However when both his job and the unity of his family are threatened he reacts.\n\nI  saw this film in a free preview screening before it came out so I had no reviews to cloud me first.  Happily most of them appear to feel the same as I did.  In terms of plot this set up will be no surprise to anyone  we&apos;ve all seen Single White Female and Pacific Heights etc, we know what happens that leads to the old bunny boiling etc.\n\nHowever One Hour Photo is different enough to justify watching.  My wife complained that it was too slow and boring but I felt this approach helped it stand out.  Instead of being a thriller it was more of a cold slow boiler than was more chilling than thrilling.  The plot is well laid out  even the money shot of all the pictures on the wall is played out while we&apos;re distracted by a joke from the Simpsons on TV.  The director&apos;s cold approach to story telling works very well and highlights Seymour&apos;s grey existence and cold life.  Only occasionally does he go astray  the fantasy sequences don&apos;t always work for instance but for almost the whole film he does very well.\n\nTowards the end Seymour&apos;s behaviour goes erratic as we expect and I was worried that the film had eventually given way to cliché.  Happily this is not the case.  Yes, Seymour&apos;s change is a bit of a leap at first but the film cleverly pulls it back at the end.  This makes it above the rest of this genre by a good head and shoulders.  Clever touches abound in the film but don&apos;t always work.  For example the director shows us that it is all about seeing by covering Seymour&apos;s eyes with objects in some shots to show he has lost his ability to watch, while the name Yorkin is a slight play on `Your Kin&apos; or your family.  These are clever but don&apos;t add very much  the eye theme felt a bit too clever and intrusive.\n\nWilliams is excellent.  Having paid to see him mush around in Patch Adams I was worried here that eventually his emotions would run away with him. However Williams (and here&apos;s something you&apos;d won&apos;t hear much) keeps it all in check and underplays wonderfully.  His Seymour is likeable, sad, pathetic and chilling all at once.  It&apos;s hard not to feel for him and he is better for being low-key.  I truly felt Williams had turned himself into a `little&apos; man  one of those people who you barely notice on the streets as they make no lasting image.  Vartan (Alias) is good as Will and Nielsen is also good as Nina.  They are also given firm support in the shape of Gary Cole and La Salle.  However his is Williams show and, by underplaying, he steals it easily.\n\nOverall this has it&apos;s flaws but it is head and shoulders above the rest of this stalker genre.  Directed with a clinic eye rather than a thrilling eye this is clever and different enough to more than justify checking it out."

The Tucker Torpedo was well ahead of its time, with disc brakes, seat belts and fuel injection, all new innovations. \n\nThe big three auto makers plotted against Tucker, not thrilled with the new competition. A real life courtroom drama ensues with a David vs. Goliath like battle with crooked politicians, bad journalism and a man with a big dream. Coppola put his heart and soul into the making of Tucker, much like the subject did into his car. This film is a fine example of bringing to life a man with a dream who never gave up; very inspirational.",

It&apos;s that sort of film you puzzle over, wondering why you sat through the darn thing. In the film we are introduced to the wandering souls of street kids who rampage through the city. The angle then shifts to the homeless with no future or hope in sight. Between the two street urchins, (they are both castrated from society), we fall into a trance created by the lingering shots that install the feelings of horror and despair. Only towards the end does our sympathy part from the street kids and move onto the subdued homeless people. Maybe the path of the street kids will one day become that of the homeless. Or maybe the director made a film to test the stamina of a festival audience. (I can tell you that at least sixty percent walked out.) Maybe I don&apos;t know. Anyway it was a bit long but I still can&apos;t get those depressing images out of my mind. Maybe that was the whole aim of it, to give us suburbanites a complex of some sort?",

With almost non-stop music and most characters having a moment in the spotlight through a song, Rock of Ages is a perfectly entertaining movie with a performance from Tom Cruise like no other that carries most of the film&apos;s laughs.\n\nNoting the disappointing box office performance of the film, it can be credited to an unfocused marketing campaign that had trouble selling the film&apos;s admittedly flimsy and predictable story and not highlighting the main characters in the film, particularly as the film is driven by its two youngest stars. This would of given audiences something tangible to be attracted to. Instead it advertised through the cheesy line &apos;nothin&apos; but a good time&apos; packing it&apos;s advertisements with the stars and the music but never seeming like a &apos;must see&apos; specifically considering the talent involved",

It was predictable insofar as the culprit behind it all, but the action momentum kept things flowing for offset. Perhaps the one thing for me that dropped this movie down by quite a few notches was the action background music score. It is very hackneyed and was so much so that it was distracting. This drumbeat bit with symbols dum dum dum dam bit does get old and pray that movie makers begin to find a new and different cool sound to accompany action scenes. An example would be like how many times would it take to listen to the Mission Impossible theme for suspense and action in a broad range of action movies before you&apos;d start screaming? Changing the &quot;beat&quot; would have made a difference in viewing this movie and given it more integrity.\n\nIf stepping back in time in how rating movies of the past now as low budget B movies, that&apos;s about where I would categorize this action flick (even if the budget may not have been low by today&apos;s standards).\n\nIf you&apos;re wanting to watch an action film with racing cars, bullets flying and Snipes flexing his muscles and bopping heads, then you won&apos;t be disappointed in watching this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this beautifully filmed documentary many years ago and never forgot it. The most interesting parts for me were the trek to base camp and traversing the ice fall. Many of the shots in the movie offered unique perspectives that really showcased the scale and grandeur of the region. I felt that sometimes the thoughts of Miura were overly philosophical and romantic, but what I was hearing was a translation from Japanese to English, so final conclusions are not possible without understanding Japanese. The actual skiing down Everest sequence was short but dramatic. I think that skiers could empathize more with the difficulties of trying to stay in control on such hard and bumpy ice! Crazy stuff! One reviewer had noted that Miura had died shortly afterward but this is not the case. Apparently he became the oldest person to summit Everest when he did it at age 75 in 2008. Quite a man! All these years later, The Man Who Skied Down Everest is as much about climbing Everest in 1970 as about actually skiing down Everest.",

His assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled &quot;Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom&quot; since parts of this movie plays like a Spielbergian adventure, kinda like an Indiana Jones comedy. It&apos;s got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun.\n\n*** (out of four)",

But he won me over and will now forever be Kenzie as far as I&apos;m concerned.\n\nGone Baby Gone is a tough and gritty movie about a child abduction and the lives it destroys. You can see the end coming a little too early in the movie, but it&apos;s still fascinating watching Kenzie slog through a lot of awful stuff before you get there. Ben Affleck has proved that he can direct a movie with the best of them. There was nothing slack or boring for the entire running time, and the ending will give you something to argue about over dinner after watching the movie.\n\nThe best detective movie I&apos;ve seen in a while.",

Also, the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in Latin is excellent. (&quot;Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio&apos;s too louda...

      "reviewBody": "Upon its release,I wasn&apos;t sure about it,and my uncertainty was further heightened when it received mixed response.So,I waited until It came out on DVD charts to watch it.And frankly,I liked this period piece.\n\nEven though it plays out more like a parody of the legend,it&apos;s not at all bad.It&apos;s rather amusing and really hilarious.With often silly but really rib tickling situations.\n\nCasanova.Legend among the venetian city,and of course the ladies.The film chronicles the life of Casanova who knows how to get a woman laid on bed for pleasure,as he rises to fame through lies,deception,heresy,and mistaken identities.But it comes a day,when he finds his true love and it seems that a man that no women has ever rejected finally meets his match.And so he tries everything to get her.And finds true love within.\n\nWith a fresh and modern approach to the legend,it does no harm at all,and it&apos;s more fun to watch this semi-biography.It features some outlandish Production designing.Exquisitely designed sets and costumes,makes this film look rich.It&apos;s got impressive script with hilarious results.And an able directing.Hallstorm makes the film look really colorful and the setting lively.It&apos;s even got a sumptuous score.\n\nOf course ,with its humor and execution,people will often compare this to Shakespeare in Love.Yes,it is similar in some ways,but it&apos;s a completely different experience overall.While that film was smartly funny.This film is silly fun.The silliness is allover the film.But it makes the bumbling characters all the more likable.It is a commendable film.\n\nIt is fresh,light on humor,outstandingly funny,and sometimes even sweet.Which makes you wonder why this film got a R rating? It wasn&apos;t all that grotante in its content.It played out more like a hard edged PG-13.\n\nThe film&apos;s tone and pacing is quick to admire.It&apos;s very likable.Largely due its settings and of course it&apos;s cast.One from the supporting actors really help it be more enjoyable.This offering from Disney is worth spending time on.It&apos;s fun,that&apos;s one thing for sure.\n\nThe cast superbly fills out their roles and help make Casanova so enjoyable.In particular Omid Djalili,who is just wonderfully funny.He is simply the one who offers snort out laughs without a hitch.His presence alone gives you belly laughs.As the bumbling sidekick ,he&apos;s just absolutely hysterical.\n\nHeath Ledger as the playboy couldn&apos;t be more perfect.He is a charm to watch.And seems to be having more fun and feels more comfortable here,when compared to the dark,tragic performance he gave in Brokeback Mountain.\n\nSienna Miller was a complete surprise.She really catches your attention.She&apos;s gorgeous and adorable.And plays out her role with confidence.Only,she can&apos;t match the performance Gwyneth Paltrow gave in Shakespeare in Love.\n\nOliver Platt is hysterical.He injects fun to his scenes.And the scenes with him and Casanova with his sidekick Lupo are the highlights.Jeremy Irons and Lena Olin were fine.\n\nAlthogether,an entertaining period piece that is aided by the great actors involved and fun to be had.Sure,it&apos;s silly ,it&apos;s unfocused and flawed.But it is an modernistic version of the Legend and it plays that way just fine.It may be farcy,but it&apos;s a delightfully delicious romantic comedy romp.Just enjoy it.",

Here this visual elements are twisted, showing the enemy in white and the russians in dark uniforms. Certainly there is a propaganda tone in the whole story, but it&apos;s quite comprehensible for the time (previous to WWII) and the country. There is another element for which this movie is so touching, the excellent music by Serge Prokofiev, and specially the part of the battle. Alexander Nevsky is very much worth seeing not seeking for a conventional war movie, but as an  alternative way of cinematic expression."

The film at many points captured the spirit of the game well and there are absolutely some great moments in the movie. As a big fan of the games, just seeing those beloved characters in their own movie is really cool. However, my problem is I feel like it should have been better. There are some funny moments in the movie for sure, but it just isn&apos;t as funny as the games are. I think the mistake that was made is that the movie was aimed more at kids, most of whom at this point probably have not played the original game (seeing as it came out almost 15 years ago). For that reason I felt like a lot of the humor was much more tame than it is in the games and so therefore a lot of times the jokes just were not funny in the movie. Also I thought the cool weapons from the games were not really showcased enough, not to mention there was hardly any appearances of the famous wrench that Ratchet uses. However, the main issue is that the movie feels more for kids than it is for the fans which is unfortunate. However, if you are a big fan of the games like I am, I still encourage you to see the movie because there definitely are some enjoyable moments and some funny moments. It is not a bad movie at all, it just should have been better.",

You have to invest with them.\n\nNo member of the cast is wasted all providing moments to revel in.\n\nOverall From Beyond was just a lot of fun to watch, its not scary unless your&apos;e a little kid, but it is grat fun.\n\nCheck it out :)",

Once i owned a VHS copy of the film in English as well, but somehow it disappeared during relocating. But I agree with people saying this is Benignis most funny film ever, not necessary his best. No other films I&apos;ve seen with him gives him so much freedom to show his comical ability throughout the entire movie. And the chemistry with him and Mattau is magnificent. Bracchi is beautiful as ever and some of the scenes makes you laugh so much that it really hurts in your stomach. I know it&apos;s out on DVD in Italy, but unfortunately without English subtitles. But there has to be someone out there knowing more about the English version than I do.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow. Just wow. I did not see that coming. As you might have already known, I&apos;m not the usual kind of guy who enjoys politically charged movies, its just not my cup of tea. It either tends to be just pure propaganda BS or just plain preachy. There are some rare occasions however when handled by a man with a vision, all pretentiousness aside not taking sides whatsoever, the end result might turn out to be something great. Such rare occasion is this movie, I was just floored. Speechless. Its journalistic integrity vs national security, the government&apos;s ever growing control over the people vs freedom of speech, its all even handed arguments and this movie excellently fleshes it all out bit by bit until we reach the shocking conclusion. This is a movie that will captivate you, it goes past the glamour of its leading actors and all that hoopla and brings you right in the complexity of the story. It makes you think, it lubes up the rusty spots in your brain and gets you involved. After watching this movie, I just felt sad because this is the kind of movies Hollywood rarely makes anymore.\n\nRod Lurie, on double duty here both as a director and a writer deserves all the kudos he can get. He shines in both departments, there was no right wing-left wing backstory here, it was an unflinching and inspired look at some of today&apos;s current issues and it was handled very greatly. It was intense, it was emotional, it was hard hitting and it is definitely one of 2008&apos;s most underrated films. The acting department all turned in some very fine performances. Matt Dillon who exudes a commanding presence playing a special prosecutor. His unnerved emotions served greatly in portraying the role and its one of the best I&apos;ve seen of him so far. Alan Alda plays a high powered attorney with gusto, I&apos;ve never really been a fan of his but after this one, I&apos;m gonna check out some of his other works soon. Kate Beckinsale turns in an intense performance as the reporter and this is by far her greatest performance to date. And lastly, Vera Farmiga who has always been a top dog in the acting department turns in a mesmerising and captivating portrayal of a hard edged CIA agent and yet also a caring mom to her daughter. Her portrayal was never out of tune and the delivery was as natural as one actress can get. God only knows why she wasn&apos;t nominated for Best Supporting Actress in the recently concluded Oscars.\n\nThe ending will just floor you and I promise you, you will not see it coming. Not by a long mile.",

He does a great job as an introverted, bitter pilot. The other reviewer is correct that Rosanna Arquette is annoying; however, she&apos;s not at all the worst part of the movie. If anything is annoying, it&apos;s the painfully inaccurate portrayal of wolves. Look, filmmakers, wolves do not stalk people through the woods and attack them out of the blue. This is real life, not &quot;The Howling.&quot; Other than those small complaints, though, this simple survival story is fun and engaging, and definitely worth noting for Reeves. 8/10 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not usually one to watch films dealing with diseases of any type  believing them to be maudlin, manipulative and even somewhat morbid  much less mental illness, but since this is expected to earn Julie Christie another Oscar (which would probably make it the longest gap between the first and second win), I decided to check it out in time for the upcoming awards ceremony.\n\nChristie&apos;s character has been struck with the debilitating Alzheimer&apos;s Disease but, thankfully, she  or, more precisely, writer-director Polley (a likable actress in her own right, though not appearing here herself)  doesn&apos;t bemoan her fate; rather, she accepts it with grace and even treats the condition with mild humor (which is the way these things should be approached but, I guess, one has to really be going through them himself to really know). Incidentally, I find extremely silly and unwarranted the recent warning by some hysterical group when, in her acceptance speech at the SAG awards, Christie joked that if she forgot the name of anyone it&apos;s because she was still in character! \n\nThe film is undeniably moving as we see the aging heroine degenerating to the point that she can&apos;t even recognize her own devoted husband (Gordon Pinsent) and even attaches herself to a fellow patient (Michael Murphy) at the clinic to which she&apos;s eventually admitted. Ironically, considering the accolades showered upon Christie, I feel that it&apos;s Pinsent who&apos;s the real protagonist here: quietly despairing yet brave in coping with the heartbreaking situation (unsurprisingly, he strikes up a friendship with Murphy&apos;s own wife  played by Olympia Dukakis). On the other hand, the viewpoint of the younger generation (obligatory in our zealously-PC world) is present here  though in a somewhat idealistic manner, if you ask me  via a teenager who chats with Pinsent during one of his visits to the clinic (and, in a deleted sequence, is revealed to be a neighbor of Dukakis and occasionally takes care of Murphy for her).\n\nActually, this isn&apos;t the kind of film one would expect an emerging young director to make  particularly since it has aspirations of being a Bergman-like chamber drama which, while fairly compelling and austere (aided with respect to the latter by the snowy Canadian setting), clearly lacks the necessary depth which a master craftsman would otherwise bring to such material.",

      "reviewBody": "GoGo (Tommy Kirk), a somewhat incompetent Martian agent, is sent to infiltrate Earth&apos;s teenagers in anticipation of an invasion from the Red Planet. Needless to say he promptly falls for Terran tart Connie (Annette Funicello, whose Disney-mandated bathing-suit is the most demure on the beach). This sci-fi-comedy, the fourth in AIPS popular &apos;beach&apos; series, is full of scantly-dressed, energetically dancing youngsters (including a youthful Terri Garr), spontaneous singing, slapstick yucks, a touch of meta-humour (usually referring to the &apos;absent&apos; Frankie Avalon), and an interesting secondary cast including silent-movie icon Buster Keaton (as Indian chief Rotten Eagle, a role that these days would be considered near blasphemous cultural appropriation, &quot;Ugh!&quot;), Dorothy Lamour (the sexy sarong-clad sidekick from the &quot;Road to...&quot; series) who has the best musical number (asking the classic generation-gap question &apos;Where Did I go Wrong?&apos;) and the lonely Maytag repairman himself, Jesse White, as the ridiculously named &apos;J. Sinister Hulk&apos;. The barely existent plot makes little sense and serves primarily to set up comedic or terpsichorean set-pieces. The film also features the great Elsa Lanchester as a wealthy but ditsy dress-shop owner and a number of the usual beach-movie crowd (including Mr. Warmth himself, Don Rickles as &apos;Big Bang&apos; a disgruntled Martian and Harvey Lembeck&apos;s brainless-biker Eric Von Zipper). The first part of the film is amusing in a goofy way but the story soon degenerates into a lengthy, time-killing, chase-sequence before climaxing at the titular party, a silly and not particularly funny series of predictable sight-gags and faux-teenage shenanigans. The 60&apos;s go-go style dancing is fun to watch but other than Lamour&apos;s song, the music (especially Annette and Tommy&apos;s duet) is unmemorable. Needful watching for all fans of beach movies and for obsessive sci-fi completists, otherwise, OK fluff for anyone in the mood to get nostalgic for a kinetic 1960s than never really existed. Kirk returned to Earth as a Martian in Larry Buchannan&apos;s penurious but evocatively entitled time-waster &apos;Mars Need Women&apos; (1968).",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;¡Viva la Muerte... Tua!&quot; - Italy (original title) or &quot;Don&apos;t Turn the Other Cheek&quot; - USA title or ¨Viva La Muerte Tuya¨- Spanish title , is an amusing Western plenty of action , shoot&apos;em up , humor and fun . A radical journalist , A Russian prince , A Mexican bandit team up seeking a cache of gold . They turned a fun filled fight for gold into a riotous revolution . A spaghetti/Paella/Schnitzel western in which three adventurers join forces during the Mexican Revolution . It deals with a man calling himself Prince Dimitri Vassilovich Orlowsky (Franco Nero) who claims to be a Russian prince as he is aware a treasure has been hidden in Mexico territory , and along with a redheaded Irish girl named Mary O&apos;Donnell (Lynn Redgrave) who wants to foment a peasant revolt in Mexico enlist other rogue character , a selfish bandit locked in Utah . Both of them , reunite the help of a humorous Mexican outlaw named Lozoya (Elli Wallach) , by saving him from a death sentence in Fort Yuma . Wallach pretends to be a Mexican folk hero named El Salvador . The trio teams up and crosses the border, the two men seeking a loot while the Irish reporter goes after her Mexican revolution . Lozoya has the key to the treasure , but Nero knows where the other half of the map is , both of whom seeking a lost gold located in Piedras Negras and confronting a cruel Mexican general (Eduardo Fajardo) .\n\nThis Zapata Western displays noisy action , thrills , stirring adventures, shoot&apos;em up , riding pursuits and is pretty amusing . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shots or stunts every few minutes . Funny and thrilling screenplay by Massimo De Rita and Juan De Orduña , also producer , and based on the novel titled &quot;The killer from Yuma&quot; by Lewis B. Patten . This is an acceptable S.W. full of action , shootouts , fist-play and some touches of humor in charge of Elli Wallach character . Wallach portrays similarly to his popular &quot;Tuco&quot; character from ¨The good, the ugly and the bad¨ . Elli Wallach is very fine, he ravages the screen as a seedy bandit , he hits , shots and runs ; plus jokes , laughs , he&apos;s a complete show . While Franco Nero as a Russian prince is a type of selfish adventurer of the West , an elegant and resourceful ¨Bon Vivant¨ , being stunningly played by Franco Nero . Eduardo Fajardo as a cruelly baddie role as Mexican general is terrific , subsequently the would play similar role in other Spaghetti , mainly directed by Sergio Corbucci . In the movie appears usual support actors as Spanish : Victor Israel , Lorenzo Robledo , Jose Jaspe , Jose Moreno , Tito Garcia , Rafael Albacin , as Italian players : Mirko Ellis , Marilu Tolo , Gisela Hahn and German : Horst Janson and Dan Van Husen who acted as secondary in many Spaghetti . It&apos;s a co-production Spanish-Italian-German and of course shot on location in Almeria and Incir De Paolis Studios, Rome, Lazio, Italy that is well photographed by Jose F. Aguayo , though is necessary a fine remastering because the film-copy is washed-out . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design , a magnificent scenario on the villages , ranch , forts and barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and fine sets filmed in Almería, Andalucía , Spain . As always , the musician Ennio Morricone, composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted and splendid leitmotif ; it&apos;s full of enjoyable sounds and lively score .\n\nThis Italian writer / filmmaker Duccio Tessari so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next . He wrote several Western as ¨A fistful of dollars ¨, ¨A train to Durango ¨Seven guns for McGregor¨ , ¨The return of McGregor¨ . He directed five Western with abundant touches of humor as ¨Vivi o Preferibilment Morti¨, ¨Don&apos;t turn the other cheek¨ and ¨Zorro¨ with Alain Delon and of course ¨Ringo ¨and sequel , mostly starred with his fetish actor Giuliano Gemma . Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable movie that will appeal to Spaghetti Western buffs .",

In this case however considering the subject matter I had no problem with that at all.\n\nWith a creature that looks like a Madball (Which oddly started the year before this came out) it&apos;s not all that easy to take seriously but I really don&apos;t think you&apos;re supposed to.\n\nAt its core it&apos;s just a creature feature with a big conspiracy plot behind it with a passable cast and sfx.\n\nSure it&apos;s not for everyone, in fact it could be considered niche but it&apos;s watchable stuff for what it is.\n\nThe Good:\n\nCreature is interesting\n\nPlot is passable\n\nThe Bad:\n\nVery little is actually explained\n\nStill a bit silly\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nEverything you see on television is real\n\nPolice car rear doors can be opened at will from the inside\n\nAxes are immune to bloodstains",

      "reviewBody": "If you have never seen a Dwain Esper film you might feel nervous sitting in a room with people who have seen and enjoy them.  Curiously there is no middle ground for Dwain Esper, you either love his films or you hate them. He was no filmmaker; originally he was a real estate agent and one of his clients defaulted on a mortgage and left a house full of filmmaking equipment.  Esper was wondering what to do with all the stuff and suddenly the movie making bug bit him and that was that;  he had a new career. Dwain was no Edward D. Wood.  Eddie&apos;s films have a laughable ineptness but the sincerity was there despite the shortcomings, and they were legion. He wasn&apos;t even comparable with Andy Milligan whose filmic efforts make Ed Wood look like John Ford by comparrison.  If I HAVE to compare Dwain with someone it could only be David Friedman.  Both went directly for the cinematic equivalent of a heart punch and gave us images so unrelentingly gritty and brutal they dared us to keep looking. Having seen most of Dwain&apos;s movies I have to say MANIAC is his magnum opus.  Horace Carpenter, a former director of silent westerns (check out FLASHING STEEDS sometime) and member of Cecil B. DeMille&apos;s stock company (ROMANCE OF THE REDWOODS, JOAN THE WOMAN, etc) plays Dr. Mierschultz, the maddest doctor to step in front of a camera.  Bill Woods is his assistant, the dangerously neurotic Maxwell who is on the run from the police (we never find out why but Dwain was not one to clutter up his screenplays with needless facts).  Neither of these characters is playing with a full deck. Meirschultz restores life to a dead woman and wants to restore someone else by transplanting a living heart into a dead body.  When he demands that Maxwell shoot himself it brings an abrupt end to their employee/employer relationship and Maxwell kills him and decides to take his place (&quot;I not only look like Mierschultz, I AM Mierschultz!  I will be a great man!&quot;)  And this is where the movie gets REALLY weird! The film has lately been restored and it available on both video and DVD so I don&apos;t want to spoil the surprises; and there are a lot of them in the 55 minute roller coaster ride of a movie.  I will warn all cat lovers to avoid this movie.  There are one or two scenes that will bother them, but there is no animal cruelty!  That one eyed cat was a real one that Dwain bought from an animal shelter.  Dwain always claimed he was making educational films to warn people against drugs, promiscuity, and to enlighten people about mental illness.  He must have known it isn&apos;t WHAT you say but HOW you say it. So pop this cassette into your VCR.  Good luck to you all.  Viddy well, little brother, viddy well."

All this is discovered when a father of a dead man tries to protect his son&apos;s reputation, and is greeted with silence and hatred from the villagers.  In his quest to find the truth...he does...the stone-cold truth.  This is a fine Hammer film, not overly scary, but incredibly atmospheric with its swirling mists, huge cavernous palatial sets, and wonderful direction and casting.  Terence Fisher does a first-rate job showing us the conspiracy going on in this village.  Peter Cushing is the town&apos;s primary culprit of hiding the truth and gives his customary good performance.  The film, however, belongs to Lee, who play an eccentric, gruff scholar helping the other son of the newly killed father.  Lee is absurd yet brilliant in his caricature.   A fine addition to the Hammer cycle."

      "name": "&quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot;- A fun big-budget &apos;B-Movie.&apos; Trite and a bit mindless, but ferociously entertaining!",
      "reviewBody": "One of the longest running modern day horror franchises, &quot;Alien&quot; is a fascinating beast in the world of entertainment and media. With its humble origins as a quiet, slow-burn sci-fi thriller, the series evolved through sequels and spin-offs into something else entirely. Whether it be through James Cameron&apos;s exquisite action-extravaganza &quot;Aliens&quot;, or the Paul W.S. Anderson schlock-tastic crossover &quot;AVP: Alien VS Predator&quot;, or even series co-creator Ridley Scott&apos;s own pseudo- philosophical quasi-prequel &quot;Prometheus&quot;... &quot;Alien&quot; has changed and evolved quite a bit over the past forty years.\n\nBut one release in particular has attracted an almost unanimous scorn and unending ridicule from all over the fanbase. A film that&apos;s so reviled, it&apos;s almost become a prerequisite that you&apos;re just expected to hate it. That being 1997&apos;s &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot;- a strange little footnote in the series that tries its hardest but never quite comes together into much of anything. An attempt to turn the series around after the mixed reception garnered by &quot;Alien 3&quot;, this fourth film aims for the stars, but stumbles and falls flat on its face. Although, if I am to be completely honest... I actually don&apos;t mind it too much. It&apos;s silly, but quite amusing and thrilling, with stylish visual direction and plenty of laughs and thrills to go around. Yes, &quot;Resurrection&quot; might be a mindless and trite exercise in style over substance... but it&apos;s also bold and extraordinarily entertaining. It&apos;s a ton of fun, even if it is objectively a &quot;bad movie.&quot;\n\nTwo-hundred years after the events of the previous film, scientists working for the military successfully clone Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the queen embryo she had been impregnated with, intent on allowing the alien life-form to reproduce so that they might study its race. This &quot;new&quot; Ripley has retained some faint memories of her former life thanks to genetic memory, but as a result of the cloning process, has also taken on some characteristics of the dreaded &quot;xenomorph&quot; species. When the offspring of the alien queen manage to escape, however, Ripley is forced to team up with a group of mercenary space-pirates (including Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder) in order to escape. Along the way, she will uncover startling and deadly revelations about the project that brought her back to life, and come face to face with a devilish new threat...\n\nDirected by Jean-Pierre Jeunet from a script by the world-renowned geek-god Joss Whedon, &quot;Resurrection&quot; does so much right that it&apos;s frankly a shame it&apos;s so routinely dismissed without much thought. It&apos;s essentially an incredibly slick and exceedingly well-made crappy B-movie. The plot is ridiculous. The characters silly and archetypal. And it&apos;s filled to burst with nonstop gore and effects. But it&apos;s made with a massive budget, an A-list cast and comes from a wildly talented director with a clear vision. Even on a pure aesthetic level, it&apos;s one of the most striking films of the franchise, with Jeunet&apos;s wonderful eye for flow and composition delivering many incredible set-pieces and designs that&apos;ll stick with you. It&apos;s just a gorgeous film all around.\n\nThe cast is an absolute blast, with Weaver once again knocking it out of the park. Especially as this &quot;new&quot; Ripley also goes through some fascinating changes that both allow Weaver to stretch her acting chops... and have some fun chewing the scenery from time to time. Perlman and Ryder are good fun as members of a space-pirate team, with Perlman in particular being a good fit for the franchise. He&apos;s a criminally underrated performer and it&apos;s a joy seeing him on- screen. We also get small but fun turns from the likes of Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Michael Wincott, and all serve the film quite well. The effects and action are top-notch for the time, with many sequences still holding up quite well to this day. An underwater chase-scene and a trippy climactic battle against a potential new threat in particular being eye-popping and absolutely jaw-dropping. And the wonderful cinematography and almost amniotic musical score add much to every single scene.\n\nBut yeah... despite that praise, the film does have a lot of problems. Like I said above- it&apos;s basically a big-budget B-movie filled with the tropes and archetypes you&apos;d expect, and it doesn&apos;t fit in with the rest of the series quite well. Unless you&apos;re willing to forgive a lot and go with the flow, you&apos;re not gonna have a good time with &quot;Resurrection.&quot; There has been a lot of talk of how Whedon disowned the film and felt his script wasn&apos;t translated properly to screen, and I could definitely see shades of that. For all the amazing things he does, Jeunet seems less interested with story and more interested in increasingly psychotic visuals. And if you&apos;re looking for anything more than surface-level entertainment, you&apos;ll be sadly let-down.\n\nBut me? I take movies for what they are and what they aspire to be. It&apos;s clear everyone involved on-screen is having a lot of fun. It&apos;s clear that Jeunet is trying to build a wild thrill-ride of a monster-movie. And it&apos;s clear that this is a film more concerned with crazed displays of gore and effects than a cohesive story. And you know what? I had a lot of fun with it. It&apos;s technically a &quot;bad&quot; movie, but to me... it&apos;s a FUN bad movie. And I&apos;m giving it slightly above average 6 out of 10. Give it another shot with an open mind. It just might surprise you how enjoyable &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot; really is.",

      "reviewBody": "Before viewing this movie, I knew it was not going to be a masterpiece. I already had incredibly low expectations for it and I thought I was going to hate it. After viewing it, I can say it&apos;s a pretty bad....ass film. It&apos;s not a great film, but it&apos;s ridiculously entertaining and even really funny. There&apos;s lots of gore here, so people who love endless CGI blood will fall in love with this film.\n\nTommy Wirkola&apos;s film adds some more depth to the classic tale from the Grimm Brothers, Hansel and Gretel. This story explores their adult lives, where of course they would become witch hunters. They usually get the job done, but then there is this witch who believes she is the most powerful of all.\n\nThe acting is good and it seems like everyone had a blast. Jeremy Renner as Hansel was good and the funniest of the siblings. Gemma Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. Peter Stormare makes for a hard-nosed chief and Famke Janssen relishes her role as the evil witch.\n\nOverall, I must admit that I had a blast with Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The story is not anywhere to be seen, but I wasn&apos;t in the mood for any in-depth story. I just wanted to see witches die, and I think I can say my wish was fulfilled. This is an action-packed horror film that will take you for a thrilling ride. I rate this film 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "The reason why I chose to watch Cutting Edge during the German Festival was simple, and that&apos;s to savour comedy from a different country, and I thought having one in a hospital setting will be perfect for an evening of laughs. Hospitals are always thought as serious places where the sick find some avenue for recovery under expert medical care, but surely it&apos;ll run riot when the doctors and nurses are a madcap lot?\n\nBut Cutting Edge is not your usual slapstick, physical comedy that provides laugh a minute scenes. In fact, the first minute will have dispelled any notion of the direction the movie will take, and that&apos;s the usual &quot;I think I left something inside the patient&quot; joke getting over and done with. It relied much more on wit, chemistry between characters, and had a lot more brewing in the background providing the laughs because of cruel irony. So what we have instead is a slew of comedy of errors, some which hit the mark, while others happen to fall flat because what we expected were delivered to a T.\n\nThe story centres on the rivalry between two neighbouring hospitals, the casually run Oakwood, and the state-of-the-art, professional outfit St George. Budget cuts mean that one of the hospitals has got to close down, and it is up to the two hospitals to show their best side to health inspectors who are there to audit their processes. Oakwood&apos;s top doctors Steffen Wesemann and Klaus Kunze (Carsten Strauch and Rainer Ewerrien respectively, who co-wrote the story, with the former taking up directorial duties as well) provide much of the comedy here as the lead characters who are tasked to brainstorm for innovative ideas to save their careers, only to discover that they&apos;re spending more time instead trying to salvage an accidental side-splitting incident involving a transplanted liver.\n\nThrow in shady undertable deals brewing within St George, and the unethical practice of having an ex-flame Dr Christiane Tietz (Nina Kronjäger) trying to extract sensitive confidential information, you&apos;ll know our duo will have their hands full. And in such pairings, you just can&apos;t avoid the usual gay jokes abound which played out to the best of laughs amongst the audience, and madcap business process experts with suspect credentials all added to the brew.\n\nCutting Edge has an air of predictability, and could have gone even crazier with its antics. But alas the comedy ends once the end credits blooper reel finishes, and nothing funny lingers after that when you try hard to reminisce just what make you laugh until tears started to flow. One or two genuinely funny scenes, while the rest are the usual textbook regurgitated comedic scenes.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an important documentary because it&apos;s an early (1969) look back at Vichy France during World War II, when many of those who lived through the Nazi Germany occupation of France were still alive and were able to speak about their experiences. It&apos;s a rather straightforward documentary, blending interviews with archival footage and contemporary scenes from France and Germany.\n\nThe French filmmakers took care to interview French, both in support and opposed to the government of France who collaborated with Germany after their swift defeat, as well as Germans, both Nazi and otherwise and British officials who were involved in the war. With three languages present, the dialogue is spoken over in French, although in the English cut that I viewed, the English was mostly left alone.\n\nIt&apos;s not a stunning film as a documentary, in terms of presentation, but some of the stories that the film brings out of its sources are quite amazing and document a lot of details that a basic study of the WWII era during a history class might not bring out. Even more notably, the individual stories of those involved at the time highlight much of what&apos;s going on while also providing an emotional connection to a person or groups of people and making the situations easier to imagine. I think The Sorrow and the Pity remains a valuable film simply because there aren&apos;t many of its kind from its era and for how personal it chooses to be in telling the stories of the men and women that lived during this terrible moment in history. But it&apos;s really long and people who don&apos;t care about history or about people&apos;s stories probably would find much in here to like. 8/10.",

Lots of wrasslin&apos; and clobberin&apos; for those who enjoy musclemen movies. There&apos;s nothing cerebral going on here, but there&apos;s fun to be had. Plus, court intrigue, a rebellion, pageantry, an evil queen, and Serge Gainsbourg as the villain. The comedy spots are sometimes awkward and puerile but not entirely unwelcome. The score from time to time gets a bit goofy but is adequately bold and triumphant when needed. There are several brief moments of focus problems, but this is otherwise richly colorful widescreen entertainment and the image quality streaming is good. Lower your expectations and disregard historical accuracy, and let the youngster in you enjoy this early 60&apos;s Hercules spinoff.",

      "reviewBody": "I guess the main reason that this is my favorite WKW movie is that it&apos;s one of the least abstract of his movies and I feel like the viewer becomes more emotionally involved with the characters because of that. The music, as always with WKW, is wonderful and the cinematography is fine, I especially like all the shots of the lush tropical forests. It isn&apos;t as beautifully photographed as many of his later films like chungking express and in the mood for love. And it doesn&apos;t feature much of the fancy techniques that WKW likes to employ in movies like fallen angels or happy together. Still I think this is my favorite of Wong Kar Wai&apos;s movies, not necessarily the best, but the one I enjoy the most. Highly Recommended.",

This version does not represent the complete novel, it offers only flimsy elements that keep it amusing and lucid. If you are attempting to read the novel for the first time, then watch this film first, it won&apos;t hurt...it won&apos;t help either! I wanted very much to like this film, but felt a bit cheated because of the indulgence of the director. I was expecting an enigmatic piece of work...what I got was, let&apos;s film the good parts and stuff the complexities. I could not relate to the actors...maybe that&apos;s the problem. A bold attempt nonetheless!"

Melvyn Douglas is not credible as her crass insurance-executive husband. This is the man who taught Garbo to laugh in the same director&apos;s &quot;Ninotcha&quot; and was generally suave and somewhat iconoclastic. As the movie proceeds, he settles into a trick-playing husband not quite consistent with the man who&apos;ve first met.\n\nBurgess Meredith is sort of wasted as the annoying pianist Oberon meets in a psychiatrist&apos;s waiting room. (Alan Mowbry is hilariously dry as the analyst. And in some ways, this is a comment on psychoanalysis.) The Meredith character is the most interest. It is a very convincing study in absolute narcissism. He may be accomplished, indeed; but whether he is or not, he is his own greatest fan and protector.\n\nThere are swipes at modern art as well as those at analysis. In some ways, it&apos;s a little retrograde.\n\nBut it&apos;s beautifully shot and the design is fabulous. This is the New York City we&apos;d all love to live in. And Oberon looks ravishing. Her performance is convincingly comic, too, though she is so match for Eve Arden in an all too small role.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an oddity in Elvis’ filmography: a quaint but pleasing musical comedy based on the popular song which had already inspired a similarly-titled film from 1936 starring Helen Morgan – apart from being featured in the Mae West vehicle SHE DONE HIM WRONG (1933) and, again, as recently as Robert Altman’s A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION (2006).\n\nThe star isn’t entirely comfortable amid the 1890s riverboat setting, what with a few of his musical performances (and especially his hairdo) coming off as inextricably modern. Still, the plot – thin as it is – emerges to be quite engaging (what with its backdrop of fortune-telling, gambling parlors, variety acts and costume parties and involving mistaken identities, misunderstandings, an attempted murder and a bar-room brawl)! The cast presents three notable female roles: Donna Douglas (as Frankie), Nancy Kovack as Elvis’ red-headed lucky charm and the flame of his jealous boss, and Sue Ane Langdon as a ditzy “blonde” – who, along with Presley’s long-suffering sidekick Harry Morgan, turns out to be the most likable character as well as the purveyor of the film’s comic relief.\n\nElvis’ best ‘new’ number is “Hard Luck”; apart from the title tune, he also gets to sing the standard “When The Saints Go Marching In” (while dressed in full military regalia)! The film is short enough at 87 mins. not to overstay its welcome, but the rather low-key presentation also prevents it from being anything more than unassuming entertainment. I wouldn’t classify it among the top-flight Presley vehicles, therefore, but it’s certainly superior to some of the bigger-budgeted (yet simple-minded) fluff he made over at MGM – this being a production from independent producer Edward Small released through United Artists.",

      "reviewBody": "THE GENERAL&apos;S DAUGHTER is movie that has been done before. But it knows this and is able to look past it&apos;s cliché&apos;s and have fun with the genre. A cop(Travolta) is called to an army base to investigate the death of a general&apos;s daughter after she has been raped and beat to death and left naked and tied to the ground with tent stakes. It&apos;s a ghastly sight and everyone wants him to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible. The problem is that EVERYONE has something to hide or is hiding someone who has something to hide. This has an all-star cast and they are terrific. The story is well written and the cast has some fun with it along the way. Director Simon West knows how to tell the story with a slight tongue and cheek flavor and still maintain the very serious nature of the subject matter. The action sequences are very well choreographed and the climax is pretty intense. So if you are looking for a familiar but really good, intense, and exciting action murder mystery THE GENERAL&apos;S DAUGHTER is well worth seeing. No matter if the critics thumbed their elitist nose&apos;s at it. They&apos;re loss is our average Joe&apos;s gain. ***1/2 out of 4.",

(Though I&apos;d never seen or heard of Marie Dressler before and now I have to find some of her other movies -- anyone else think she resembles Lois Smith?) \n\nWhat was remarkable to me about the film was its timelessness. So many of the problems and situations embedded in the plot can be found in the headlines of today&apos;s newspapers and tabloids. Of course economic downturns, adultery, and social-climbing are common fodder for movies, but it is unusual for classic films to go into some of the nasty details without becoming melodramatic; they describe sexual addiction, for heaven&apos;s sake! I&apos;ve never seen humanity so realistically portrayed in a classic film before (despite the moments that some would call &quot;over-acting&quot;) and so this movie made me feel more connected to the past than I have ever before."

      "reviewBody": "I always thought it would make sense to set the story in modern times, since now we truly have the technology to do stuff like that. But more importantly (like Frankenstein) we are too obsessed with science and lack the moral and ethical restraint that would prevent us from doing such things.\n\nSo I think it fits great into﻿ modern times... but I always imagined a modern Dr. Frankenstein to look somewhat like Gunther von Hagens... (-; But I also like their take on it and the way they told the story it made sense to have a &quot;Victoria Frankenstein&quot; instead of a &quot;Victor&quot;. And also the film of course by it&apos;s very nature of putting it in a present day setting naturally can&apos;t stay 100% true to the book. But still, I think it wasn&apos;t any less true to the book than the bulk of the other film adaptations and the ending was better and more realistic than in most other film adaptations.\n\nAnd I love that even though every Frankenstein movie is﻿ always very different, they still always have little references to the previous movies. Like in this one it&apos;s the tank, which is very similar to the 1994 as well as the 1910 version. And let&apos;s not forget the infamous &quot;It&apos;s alive!&quot; line as well as the lightning, the electrical surge, the bolts and the cap. (those things are all references to the other movies, as they are not present in the book)\n\nAnyway, go give this version a chance... you won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "What drew me to this movie was the cast of Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman, two phenomenal actors in their own regards. The only expectation that I had going into see this film was that I would be unimpressed by Tobey Maguire. Having seen him in several films (including Spider-Man), I must say that I wasn&apos;t prepared for the incredible performance he provided.\n\nThis movie was very simplistic. Nothing flashy, no real special effects, small amounts of simple guitar music as a soundtrack. But it conveyed a whole roller coaster of emotions from the beginning. The growth of Jake Gyllenhaal&apos;s character, the anguish displayed by Natalie Portman, the palpable pain and suffering by Tobey Maguire, and the fear and anger displayed by the eight-year-old Bailee Madison all combine for a very gripping tale.\n\nMany regard this movie as anti-war. I simply do not see it as such. Soldiers are praised for their heroism on the battlefield (which they completely deserve), but all too often the wounds they suffer physically and mentally are disregarded. This movie illustrates the very real problem of the mental health of our service men and women, and the problems it causes in family dynamics.",

Not enough, the complexly developed story also stretches out to themes of friendship, passion, revenge and death wish. This assumes intense preoccupation with all the multiple layers of the movie. In aesthetic, tender images the stunned audience witnesses events that blurred the frontiers between reality and fiction probably already during the shooting. Just apparently in contradiction the events are accompanied by citations of German contemporary history, which gives Marian Dora&apos;s work a powerful intellectual historical basis. The movie&apos;s structure is similar to the baroque cathedral which gets a central role in the movie: The story and (only on the first sight) marginal details get mirrored like a symmetry axis and seem to be the counterpart of the leading characters destiny.\n\nA personal work of director Marian Dora, the movie defies all formal conventions of storytelling. In nearly all scenes the movie breaks up to the audience&apos;s expectations. Established viewing and thinking habits as well as generally accepted and provided moral patterns are getting destroyed and stay unusable. If comparisons are appropriate at all, THE ANGELS&apos; MELANCHOLIA has its place between the work of Jodorowsky or Pasolini. However, the movie can&apos;t deny its German roots and openly admits its highly controversial underground cinema status: Poetic, radical, original, unwieldy and impossible to forget."

What I like the most about this film is the techniques. There are many surreal scenes in this film. These surreal scenes, which contain some deep meanings unknown to me, are sometimes very funny, sometimes very haunting, and most of them are full of undescribable feelings. Many scenes are shocking, sad, nostalgic, and beautiful at the same time, especially the scenes when the characters are suddenly and amazingly transformed into deformed dolls. I feel like laughing everytime the cat appears, though I don&apos;t know why the cat has that effect on me. The scene when the boy is dancing on the ship is also outstanding. I wish this film or its director could be as famous as, if not more than, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; or &quot;If.&quot; &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;, while as sharply satirical as those two films, still has a profound effect on personal feelings. Though I don&apos;t know how well this film reflects the political, military, social, or historical issues, at least I know that, after seeing this movie, I looked at cats in a different way for some time.",

Don&apos;t get me wrong, it is obvious that we are seeing a Woody Allen film from the initial credits, but he still can surprise us. \n\nWe see different stories through out the film. Some show aspects of the Italian lifestyle and culture, presented from a beautiful Rome; that city that Allen wants to present to us, his Rome. But other stories present again the issues that have been important to him, those problems that for centuries have raised for humankind: love, infidelity, death, success, fame, happiness; those issues that Allen simply loves to discuss. \n\nThe cast is charming and I want to highlight a sincere Roberto Benigni; Jesse Eisenberg, that resembles perfectly the young Woody Allen; and the beautiful and talented Ellen Page, with a powerful character that makes you impossible not to fall in love with her.\n\nI have the huge bias of been a Woody Allen fan and that is probably why I enjoyed so much this movie. It is thrilling to see him acting again. See all that neurosis again in the big screen. This movie surprises, can be as surreal as Buñuel would be and also as real as Allen is with daily problematics.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;If my wonderful, beautiful, marvelous virtue is still intact, it&apos;s no thanks to me, I assure you.&quot;\n\nHigh Society is an irreverent, star-studded, music infused lite-romance set amongst the idle rich of Newport, Rhode Island. Quite funny and rarely serious for long, High Society revolves around wealthy and gorgeous Samantha Lord (Grace Kelly), and the three men competing for her affection as her wedding day draws near. \n\nBing Crosby stars as her ex-husband, John Lund as her current fiancé, and Frank Sinatra as a visiting reporter come to cover her wedding for a gossip rag. Most of the entertainment from the film comes from Sam bouncing around between the three men, as she goes from a frosty goddess to a warm, fun woman truly ready to marry. I&apos;m sure her behavior in the movie seemed a bit risqué at the time, but it&apos;s all ultimately innocent in the end. And of course by the finale, (almost) everyone is happy. \n\nThere are quite a few songs sprinkled throughout the movie, with Crosby, Sinatra, Kelly, and Celeste Holm all getting a chance to belt out a tune or two. Louis Armstrong serves as something of an on-screen narrator, and also plays occasionally with his band. The songs are pleasant, with more than one or two likely to have you humming along.  \n\nGrace Kelly fans will be quite pleased with this, as she rarely looked more stunningly beautiful and gets to show off both her comedic skills and singing talents. She&apos;s quite funny, here, and carries a large share of the comedic burden as the movie goes on. Her chemistry with all the other leads is solid, and she carries off Samantha&apos;s mini- transformation quite well. Basically, if you weren&apos;t a fan of hers before seeing this, I&apos;d be pretty amazed if you weren&apos;t smitten with her by the time the credits roll. This was her last role before leaving Hollywood for Monaco, and she definitely went out on a high note (pun not intended).\n\nHigh Society is a charming, fun movie that should appeal to fans of classic films, musicals, or any of the cast. It&apos;s hard not to smile as you watch it, but why would you want to avoid it, anyway?",

In fact, all of the acting is skin deep. Even though the dark-haired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance...an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is &apos;butcher.&apos; Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty alt-country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension. Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low-angles that adds to the malaise...but for a film that calls itself horror, I did not even get close to flinching once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family&apos;s maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest.",

      "reviewBody": "I have read the above reviewers comments with interest. And I have just had the good fortune to see the remarkable documentary &apos;A Jihad for Love&apos; at the Toronto International Film Festival. Having reviewed films for years, I know that I do have the qualifications necessary to write a full review of the film-but I postpone that till the film gets a theatrical release, which I believe the filmmaker and the producer(s) are seeking.\n\nI post these observations as initial comments on the film.\n\nIn my twenty-five years of writing about documentary film-making I have rarely encountered films of the caliber of A Jihad for Love. It just so happens that in the last three weeks I have also been able to see &apos;Trembling Before G-d&apos; and &apos;For the Bible Tells Me So&apos;-a strange but interesting co-incidence because all three films deal with different aspects of the condemnation of homosexuality in the three primary monotheistic religions-Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Being of Jewish heritage myself (but primarily agnostic) I found the Jewish film to be pedestrian and extremely repetitive-a n immature work that has little cinematic merit. The subjects are not engaging and in fact frequently not likable and tend to &apos;whine&apos; a lot. The quality of the film-making is pedestrian and repetition and boredom seem to be the two primary hallmarks for that film, which left me with more questions than answers and as a Jewish person-also made me feel a sense of complete alienation from the lives depicted in the film (Hasidic Jews being very much the minority in my religion). The Christianity film, adopts a familiar-formal and pedantic tone of talking head style interviews and certainly-neither its subjects nor its cinematic style lend themselves to any kind of cinematic craftsmanship whatsoever. However I must congratulate Mr. DuBowski on producing this eminently and far more superior work (as opposed to the earlier film he directed) with this next film, directed by first time filmmaker Parvez Sharma.\n\nOn the other hand, A Jihad for Love, deals with Islam, which has been a focus of our lives and the media for some time now. I approached the film with very little knowledge of that religion and found that the film lead me in unexpected ways, into the very core of the faith and enlightened me in ways I did not even know possible. This film has excellent production values, which lack in the other two and the film-making and storytelling of what seem to be very diverse subjects and geographic locations is superb. The narrative and the story arc seems to be hard to follow initially, but the clarity that emerges soon, is remarkable and deft. The film washes over you like a gentle breeze-even though you are constantly made aware of the dangers and the violence that lurks throughout. The individuals we meet only too briefly in the film are remarkable not just for their courage but in also the honesty with which they approach the camera. The thematic elements of weaving in celebration and despair are remarkable and the filmmaker successfully engages with a wide canvas of possible audience emotions. I thought the use of Bollywood imagery and Arab belly dancing was an act of sheer virtuosity and courage, knowing full well that images like that are the ones most likely to be condemned by a religion that commands austerity from its followers. What I also found remarkable was the multiplicity of languages in this poignant, powerful and elegant work. All of the characters speak to us with the help of sub-titles (which it takes some getting used to) but express themselves in the most eloquent ways. I wondered indeed if this is the language of their daily lives-when a young and compelling Iranian refugee sits atop a hill in Turkey and wonders out loud to his friends: Why does the sky have to be the same color for everyone?&apos; What is also remarkable in this film is that the balance of characters concealing their identity with those showing their faces (like the gay&apos; Imam&apos; in South Africa) is almost equal and Mr. Sharma displays rare artistry and sensitivity in dealing with depicting invisibility keeping the visual medium in mind. (In &apos;Trembling&apos; for example-a film that is very poorly shot in comparison, I found the use of a flower vase to hide the rather unlikable couple-Malka and Leah, ugly and claustrophobic).\n\nIn the business of truth telling and verite cinema, I find this film a refreshing lesson on how far documentary film-making can go if made with the care and the poetry that cinema affords us. Unfortunately in the age of reality television and hastily packaged sound bites and the polemics of many other films, we have few films of this remarkable construct and vision available to us. I look forward to viewing and reviewing this film again as it starts its journey. A small but extremely significant pearl-A Jihad for Love, I feel will be remembered by all those who see it, for a long time to come. This film demands that the audience engage with it and there is a lot of reading-so be warned to be sufficiently caffeinated for a highly rewarding intellectual and cinematic experience!",

      "reviewBody": "Space shuttle pilots Grant and Tanner discover a giant alien spacecraft between earth and moon. During an investigation, Grant finds a football-like thing and a corpse of a 14&apos;000-year old astronaut! Back on Earth, in a NASA laboratory, the mentioned football-thing comes to life and combines itself with the corpse! The result can only be described as sort of a zombie-robot killing machine. It soon wreaks havoc on everything in his path, but Grant manages to destroy it. On moon, Grant and Tanner then discover the remainings of an ancient civilisation! Inside a giant palace, they find the female survivor of a war that took place there 14&apos;000 years ago, and they have to fight against other zombie-robot creatures. They are not aware that they brought the final piece of technique (their landing capsule) to the moon that allows an army of robot-aliens (known as &quot;Kaaliun&quot;) to finish their spacecraft in order to conquer the earth! They&apos;ve been waiting for 14&apos;000 years, and now Grant must find a way to stop them...\n\nI really don&apos;t understand why everybody calls this a B-movie. Maybe it was not in theatres in the US, but it was in Europe. The special effects are great. Of course, they used models in several scenes, but it was good model work. The film has exactly the kind of wonderful and frightening (thanks to Joseph LoDuca&apos;s score) atmosphere that makes science-fiction movies great. And we have Walter Koenig and the incredible Bruce Campbell, what more could we ask for? Yes, the movie isn&apos;t perfect, but what movie is? Yes, it can&apos;t be taken seriously, like most other SF movies either, and yes, a higher budget would have added to the film&apos;s quality, but the budget can&apos;t have been that low either. This film is also NOT an &quot;Alien&quot; rip-off and NOT a &quot;TERMINATOR&quot; rip-off, nor a rip-off of any other movie. It&apos;s idea has absolutely nothing in common with the mentioned SF classics and is very original. Contrary, it has been ripped-off by John Bruno&apos;s &quot;Virus&quot; in 1999. If you really call yourself a fan of SF movies, you simply can&apos;t dislike &quot;Moontrap&quot;."

      "name": "Interesting, timely little movie",
      "reviewBody": "I stumbled upon this movie and unfortunately missed the beginning, however it was quite easy to catch up on the basic plot. What first intrigued me was that the info button showed this as one star, yet the little bit of dialogue I had heard seemed pretty intelligent (a grouchy meal time exchange is happening when a lovely character who looks uncannily like Natasha Richardson comes in and cheerfully says &quot;good morning&quot; and another character replies, &quot;how does she know it&apos;s morning, or even good&quot;...also another actress looks very much like Felicity Jones). I have no faith in the ratings done by these cable services--I once saw Citizen Kane rated 2 stars (it&apos;s since been updated to 4) and Deadpool, 4 stars, and the 3 Godfathers described as &quot;...three outlaws on the lamb...&quot; Yikes. ...so I dove in. I notice many of the scathing reviews here are from at least 4 or more years ago, pre-Trump. One of the things I noticed immediately about this movie is how perfectly timely it is. We have had the hottest recent years on record, the EPA is being stripped, auto emission regulations reversed, he&apos;s bringing coal back (yeah, right), and climate scientists are saying that without CO2 emission reductions, we&apos;re on track to be at 900 parts per million for CO2 by 2100 (in context, pre-industrial revolution, about 200 years ago, CO2 was 280 ppm). We are on track to recreate the early Eocene Epoch. A baby born today will be 83 in 2100 and by the time his or her grandchild is 83, it&apos;s possible life on earth will pretty much resemble the dystopian vision portrayed in so many science fiction works. And thus we land in the world of Spacecraft IC-1, where a group of people are carefully chosen to go to an Earth-2 colony and populate it with a healthy, as perfect as possible genetic line. Meanwhile, back on messy old earth, the population is oppressed by what sounds like a nefarious dictator class and a strict code known as RULE, &quot;the Reformed United League Executive council&quot;. This apparently was supposed to take place in 2015 (something I probably missed at the beginning)--fast forward to 2017, and instead of trying to fix this beautiful, perfect planet full of trees, rivers, mountains, waterfalls, butterflies, and rainbows (thanks Bill Maher), we have pledged NASA 20 billion dollars to send men to Mars. Billionaire hobbyists are busy spending their spare change on elaborate bomb shelters in New Zealand and manned Mars missions, because what do you do with all that money--certainly not help your fellow man on Earth. One of the main criticisms of this movie is how cheap it looks--in other words, it doesn&apos;t have a glossy, futuristic look. Please remember that this was made in 1965, 4 years before man landed on the moon. Under the circumstances, I think the film&apos;s vision is just fine. In fact, I admire that they put the characters in ordinary clothing and didn&apos;t try to cook up some crazy futuristic look. It kind of reminded me of the simple look of a Twilight Zone episode. Keep in mind, if you re-watch the original Star Trek, it looks pretty cheap and cheesy too by modern standards. The other part of the movie&apos;s plot that I thought was pretty well done was that of mutiny. Really, mutiny is timeless and what happens aboard Spacecraft IC-1 isn&apos;t so very different than what happened on the Bounty. Overall, of course the special effects are very outdated by today&apos;s standards, but if you overlook this, the story is complex and intriguing, the acting is decent, and the dialogue is quite well-written. Give it a chance.",

      "name": "DeMille Leave&apos;s Old World History For Awhile",
      "reviewBody": "Cecil B. DeMille&apos;s spectacles were mostly bound to America and Americans for most of the silent film period into the early talkies. His exceptions were the original &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; (but there was a modern story set in America as well as the tale of Moses), and &quot;King of Kings&quot; where he told the story of Jesus&apos;s Ministry. Then, in 1933, he decided to do movies that dealt with the history of the ancient world. First came &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; in 1933 and then &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in 1934. Both were in the Roman Empire, and both allowed DeMille ample scope to be lascivious and tantalizing about sex, and yet be moralistic as well (especially in &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot;). Both had Claudette Colbert in them in the female lead (shared in &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; with Elissa Landi). &quot;Sign&quot; had Charles Laughton and Frederic March in the leads. But &quot;Cleopatra&quot; only had Henry Wilcoxon and Warren Williams as the leads. Still both films were very successful.\n\nDeMille seems to have planned to tap European and Middle Eastern history for awhile. His next historical pageant is &quot;The Crusades&quot; which, while an entertaining film (none of his films are less than entertaining) is not as good as the first two. It is actually telling the story of the Third Crusade of 1190 - 92, and (although lauded in some of these comments as being historically accurate) it doesn&apos;t really go into it too well. \n\nThe third crusade was led by Richard the Lion Hearted (King Richard I of England), King Philippe Augustus of France, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarosa. Now the movie does show Philippe at the initial planning stages, and Richard soon getting involve. But aside from an occasional mention of Barbarosa, and one or two brief glimpses of an actor as the Emperor, his character is never developed. Frederick Barbarosa was a lead player in this crusade, and he drowned trying to ford a stream during the early part of it. This was a real tragedy for the European invaders, as Frederick had been umpiring the constant arguments between Philippe and Richard (neither of whom liked each other). None of that is in the film.\n\nTo fully appreciate this film (flaws and all) watch it first after seeing &quot;Becket&quot; and then &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. Those two films tell the story of Richard Plantagenet&apos;s daddy and mommy, Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henry II had built up his kingdom and power, despite problems from his old friend Thomas a&apos;Becket. Most of the power was due to the inheritance of Eleanor in France, which was her dowry. Eleanor had been Queen of France briefly, but divorced King Louis and took her property with her. Henry was in a very good position to dominate King Louis and his son Philippe. But (from &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;) you will remember that Philippe tells off Henry that time is on his side - Henry is going to die soon, and Philippe is young. Philippe was also very sly. He was more interested in getting Richard into the Crusade so to weaken the English government, and allow Philippe to make incursions into Eleanor&apos;s power base. And it worked like a charm. Once Barbarosa was dead, Philippe took advantage of the first argument with Richard to take his men back to France. Soon he was in touch with Richard&apos;s brother, Prince John, who was regent for the king. John soon makes arrangements to keep Richard from ever coming home again. \n\nAt this point I&apos;d suggest you see &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; followed by &quot;Robin and Marion&quot; to see the return of Richard and the end of his lamentably bad reign.\n\nDeMille hints at the political skulduggery. Note the business between Conrad of Montsarrat (the potential King of Jerusalem) and John. But John is made to be the mainspring of these conspiracies. That he was involved there is not doubt, but Philippe was the real key to them.\n\nThere is also another issue, touched on in &quot;The Lion In Winter&quot; but dropped here - DeMille would never have discussed it in the context of a hero. Richard I was gay. His marriage to Berengaria was not a love match (although made one here and in the later film &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot; based on Sir Walter Scott&apos;s &quot;The Talisman&quot;). So on that part the film is not accurate. \n\nThe battle for Acre was very bloody, but the worst part of it (which Arab historians have bristled about for centuries - British ones tended to ignore it) were the massacres of Arab (and Jewish) citizens at Acre. Somewhere over 30,000 (at least) were killed. This atrocity was sort of dropped from the movie.\n\nThe acting is good, and some of the scenes quite fascinating: the marriage by proxy of Berengaria and Richard (represented by his friend the minstrel Blondel); The literal horse (or cattle) trading by the King of Navarre for his daughter to get married is funny. Especially moving is a scene where Richard sees his old friend, the blacksmith, die after a fight with the Saracens. \n\n&quot;The Crusades&quot; was a box office flop. DeMille (for the next 15 years) made films about American History, beginning with &quot;The Plainsman&quot;. Only in 1949 did the old world beckon again with &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. And his final masterpiece, the second &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;, would be his picture of ancient Egypt."

      "reviewBody": "This is a clever and entertaining comedy that has some dramatic and romantic touches as well. It&apos;s almost two movies-in-one: a dramatic holdup and a comic getaway. The holdup scene does has comedy but is more dramatic. It reminded me of the &apos;70s classic &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; in which the hostages are kept by a couple of robbers and the crooks demand the normal assortment of getaway vehicles. Except in here, ringleader Bill Murray wants a &quot;monster truck&quot; along with everything else. You know with Murray you are going to get outrageous humor and satire.\n\nAnyway, the bulk of the film concerns what happens after the trio - Murray, Randy Quaid and Geena Davis - after they successfully escape the holdup. The bottom line is that they just can&apos;t get out of New York City. One disaster after another keeps happening, and it&apos;s all kind funny (and frustrating!). The ending I won&apos;t spoil.\n\nMurray plays his normal wise-guy role and Quaid is good as the emotional slapstick-type buffoon. For some reason, the scene in which Quaid runs full-tilt into a newspaper stand and knocks himself out almost had me in tears laughing. Davis complements the two with her coolness and eye candy for the male audience. Veteran Jason Robards plays the chief detective on the case, and shows comedic touches of his own.\n\nWhat also is fun to watch nowadays is Tony Shalhoub. When this film came out, hardly anyone knew him. Now he&apos;s famous as &quot;Monk&quot; on the television series of the same name. In this film, he plays an Arabic cab driver and you have to see this performance to believe it! A couple of other familiar faces also show up in here, including Bob Elliot from the old radio duo of &quot;Bob and Ray.&quot;\n\nThere is no sex, no bloodshed, just a lot of jokes but the &quot;R&quot; rating ought to tell you something about the language in here. The jokes and story were good enough on their own and didn&apos;t need all the profanity.",

      "reviewBody": "John Cusack plays John Kelso, a New York writer who goes down to Savannah, Georgia to interview Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), a wealthy socialite and art connoisseur who likes to give expensive parties. While in Savannah, Kelso gets involved in murder, voodoo, and some eccentric characters. Kelso is a plot-convenient stand-in for John Berendt, the author of the nonfiction book upon which the film&apos;s screenplay was based.\n\nWith the film&apos;s intriguing title, maybe I was expecting too much. I really don&apos;t know what director Eastwood was trying to tell us here. The film was cluttered with disjointed subplots, which included: a murder and subsequent trial, a romance, a character study of Williams, a parade of strange characters largely irrelevant to other subplots, a travelogue of a Southern city, and some voodoo thrown in.\n\nThe acting ranged from good (Kevin Spacey) to mediocre to fairly poor. The cinematography and the production design were adequate.\n\nThis film has entertainment value for Kevin Spacey fans. But the story itself lacked focus, and it led nowhere. Indeed, the ending was ambiguous, in an irritating sort of way.\n\nThe main problem with &quot;Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil&quot; was its questionable rationale. Why was it made? Just because a film is based on a true event does not ensure a favorable cinematic outcome, especially if the film&apos;s screenplay digresses significantly from its source. Better direction would have helped a lot, as would a complete rewrite of the screenplay, based on a more cohesive premise."

Then, to my surprise, I discovered this was a Stephen King adaptation, and not the brainchild of some wannabe King.\n\nSomething&apos;s extremely off. Hard to put a finger on it at first look, but the director seems to have forgotten to set a particular mood and pace for the material in hand. This is so rushed it fails to be taken seriously. Even less credible an outcome than Zombie parodies.\n\nAnd to top it: I believe it requires some kind of special talent to have Samuel L. Jackson as a lead in a movie and still not even manage to make the outcome even moderately entertaining.\n\nI may not even make it till the end."

This is just so bad it&apos;s boring.\n\nFrom a Wittgenstein scholarship perspective, it doesn&apos;t get worse than this. It&apos;s a mix of rumors, inaccuracies, falsities and &quot;fun-facts&quot; that lack all respect for its subject. Since Terry Eagleton and the other writers have chosen to give the story what I&apos;d imagine they will call a &quot;subjective&quot; or &quot;personal&quot; slant, you wold expect them to at least make it fun! No such luck.\n\nHere what&apos;s wrong: 1. Andrew Lloyd Webber costumes. 2. Every eccentricity is exaggerated. 3. Horrible actors. 4. Wittgenstein was afraid of being misunderstood and only create a jargon self-proclaimed disciples would propagate. This film is what he had nightmares about. 5. Wittgenstein lived at a time when categories like &quot;homosexual&quot; weren&apos;t as firm as today. This films premise that &quot;he was gay and therefore weird and a great philosopher&quot; shows lack of respect. 6.It&apos;s a case study of why psychologising your subject leads to disaster. 7. They made an interesting person into a fraternity joke.\n\nAnd, no. It&apos;s not bad in an interesting way. Do you&apos;re self a favour. Really.",

      "reviewBody": "What is &quot;Polder&quot;? Initially, it is a movie about an unscrupulous corporation called NEUROO-X, which wants to transform every human being into a mindless user trapped in an even more mindless video game that simulates real life. It is up to Marcus, former employee of NEUROO-X, and his wife Ryuko to expose the schemes of the bad guys. If that is even possible; because they might be already part of the sadistic game. Furthermore, &quot;Polder&quot; is a multimedia experiment. When I watched the movie in my local cinema, I was invited to download the &quot;Polder&quot; App. The App played an audio file with a voice that put me in the mood for the movie. There also were background actors walking around the cinema. It was suggested that my visit to the movies was an illusion just like the illusions that would be depicted in the movie itself. It was a nice gimmick I suppose, but not really necessary. I&apos;d rather talk about the movie itself.\n\nSo, what about it? &quot;Polder&quot; basically is a mishmash of Swiss and Japanese culture. If you ever wanted to watch a movie that features Wilhelm Tell&apos;s son Walterli, sweet lil&apos; alp girl Heidi, creepy Sadako from the infamous j-horror movie &quot;Ringu&quot; and some random cosplayer with pink hair, this is your dream come true! Despite the movie advertising itself as &quot;highly intelligent&quot; and &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, it&apos;s more trash than art-house. I mean, there&apos;s a character who looks like Friedrich Nietzsche behaving like Arnold Schwarzenegger! If that&apos;s not decidedly awesome, then what is?\n\nI won&apos;t lie to you: This movie is a mess. It piles so many reality layers on top of each other, it gets ridiculous. In a way, &quot;Polder&quot; could almost be considered a parody of Christopher Nolan&apos;s pseudointellectual dream escapade &quot;Inception&quot;. Nolan&apos;s movie is a self-indulgent mess, too, but not nearly as enjoyable. Although Polder is a Swiss-German co-production, it owes much more to Asian cinema with its elaborate tomfoolery undermining the very idea of art-house flicks. Movies like Tetsuya Nakashima&apos;s &quot;Memories of Matsuko&quot;, Katsuhito Ishii&apos;s &quot;The Taste of Tea&quot; and Park Chan-wook&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m A Cyborg, But That&apos;s OK&quot; come to mind.\n\nYet &quot;Polder&quot; has not mastered the childlike carelessness of its Asian counterparts. It still thinks too much, takes itself too seriously. It is concerned with conceptual questions like: &quot;What does it mean to be human?&quot; or &quot;What is reality, what is fantasy?&quot; How boring is that? Give me a break! Still, the German-speaking film scene needs movies like this badly; movies that dare to be silly. &quot;Polder&quot; might not be a masterpiece. It most certainly is a failed experiment. But as failed experiments go, this is one of the more entertaining ones.",

      "reviewBody": "As a growing Tarzan fan, of both the books and the movies, I gotta say watching this as a kid on VHS was disappointing. I only watched it again many years later because I just happened to stumble onto it while curiously skimming over Casper Van Dien&apos;s filmography and decided to make this review.\n\nIn 1913, John Clayton aka Tarzan (Casper Van Dien) is preparing to marry Jane Porter (Jane March) in England. But suddenly, he receives a vision sent by a shaman named Mugambe (Winston Ntshona), informing him that explorer and treasure hunter Nigel Ravens (Stephen Waddington) is plundering African villages in search of the lost city of Opar. Now, Tarzan must return to Africa to stop Ravens while Jane follows him to assist on his adventure.\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward but shows little faithfulness to the source literary material. For example, the origin of Tarzans name came from his tribe of apes, not the natives. Jane is American, not British. And Opar is portrayed almost completely differently as a gigantic pyramid instead of a city. Furthermore, Queen La and the Oparoids are completely absent. Finally, with the uncharacteristic supernatural elements it felt like it was trying to emulate an Indiana Jones type atmosphere, but it falls completely short.\n\nFirst of all, the cast don&apos;t fit their roles. With his build, Casper Van Dien made an acceptable Tarzan, but he lacked the height and the rugged features of Johnny Weissmuller and Christopher Lambert from past incarnations, and his awful fake British accent didn&apos;t help. Jane March is a run-of-the-mill damsel in distress who mostly just complicates things for Tarzan. Steven Waddington is a Rene Belloq wannabe who isn&apos;t tough or intimidating enough to impress the audience, let alone challenge the King of the Apes.\n\nThe special effects were poor for the most part. Tarzan&apos;s ape friends were men wearing ridiculously fake looking suits and Mugumbe&apos;s CGI Cobra form is very cheesy, even by 90s standards. Speaking of which, what did Mugumbe even need Tarzan to fight the bad guys for if he could turn into a snake? And even bees?! It doesn&apos;t make any sense.\n\nThe action scenes are sloppy and muddled up by excessive slow motion, choppy editing, and close ups that make them hard to enjoy.\n\nThere were some redeeming qualities though. I did appreciate the beautiful landscape of South Africa where filming took place, from the lush jungles to the savannah fields. And the massive pyramid of Opar itself, which was made with practical effects, is impressive. There was also some pretty nice footage of real animals to counter the fake gorillas, including a Chimp named Jebba.\n\nIn the end, this was an ambitious but failed attempt to create a modern Tarzan in the 90&apos;s that damaged Casper Van Dien&apos;s reputation in Hollywood. Don&apos;t watch this unless you&apos;re either bored or a massive Tarzan fan.",

That is precisely why I love it.\n\nLong before Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels made idiocy popular on the big screen with &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, two enterprising men, Paul Rodriguez and Michael O&apos;Keefe, strove to make completely base humor acceptable to the American masses.  They definitely succeeded.  These two (and the able supporting cast) make what easily could have been a poor movie into something funny.  One has to wonder exactly how much ad-libbing was going on in this one (at least on Rodriguez&apos; part).\n\nDon&apos;t miss the charm school scene with the wine tasting.  The only other time I had fallen out of my chair laughing was when Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were trying to douse the fire of the peppers in their hamburgers with ketchup and mustard.  Those of you who have attentively observed both will understand what I mean.",

      "reviewBody": "Almost everything about this film ... from the casting and acting, to the plot, to the musical numbers, to the costumes and hairstyles ... seems fake.\n\nNatalie Wood, 27 years old, plays 15-year old Daisy Clover, a spunky tomboy/brat/beach bum extraordinaire. Daisy, who lives with her eccentric elderly mom, played by Ruth Gordon, in a shabby wooden trailer near the beach in Southern California, has Hollywood stars in her eyes. And when Raymond Swan (Christopher Plummer), head of The Swan Studio comes calling, Daisy jumps at the chance to be a movie star.\n\nShe leaves her mom and lets Swan remake her into America&apos;s ideal of a teenage girl. In effect, Swan Studio is Daisy&apos;s image maker. Even though surrounded by cold-blooded snakes in the movie business, Daisy is such a brat that she doesn&apos;t elicit much sympathy from me. But then I found little interest in any of the characters.\n\nWith the exception of Daisy&apos;s mom, the characters lack depth of emotion. Maybe that&apos;s the point ... Hollywood is filled with emotionally empty people. They&apos;re all image, no substance.\n\nSet in the 1930s, the film has visuals that look straight out of the 1960s, especially relative to hairstyles and costumes. The musical numbers, though well executed, trend toward upbeat, bubble gum optimism, which is inconsistent with the film&apos;s overall thematic cynicism. I know what they&apos;re driving at with these musical numbers. But the abrupt tonal shift is jarring.\n\nPerhaps the worst element of this film is Natalie Wood&apos;s performance. She seriously overacts. It&apos;s a performance not unlike that of Patty Duke, in &quot;Valley Of The Dolls&quot; (1967).\n\n&quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; is filmed in color. It would have been more realistic had it been filmed in 1930s B&amp;W. And the cinematography projects an annoying wide screen image.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this film is the presence of the always interesting, and unique, Ruth Gordon. Otherwise, this film is forgettable."

After all, it&apos;s about a top secret project where people are told they&apos;d explore mind reading and memory. Of course, there&apos;s a darker reason for the experiment...but I was practically comatose from boredom so I really stopped caring after a while. This is because the film is very low energy, has some poor acting and really could have used some serious editing. Instead, it just goes on and on....and you keep waiting and HOPING something happens. Eventually, the subjects all go mad and start doing bad things...but it was frankly too late when the film actually picked up!\n\nThe most problematic thing about this film isn&apos;t that it&apos;s bad...but it&apos;s BORING and bad. Some bad films are so bad they&apos;re unintentionally funny and fun to watch. As for this one, nothing happens for so long that you have to force yourself to keep watching...which doesn&apos;t happen if you watch bad films like &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; or &quot;The Room&quot;. So, you&apos;d never want to sit down with your friends and watch &quot;The Brain Machine&quot; to laugh at it....you&apos;d just turn it off and find something else...anything else.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Akame shijuya taki shinju misui&quot;, or &quot;attempted love suicide at the 47 falls of akame&quot; is a very basic story in a very complex and mysterious universe. The main character is a who tries to flee from his past, and he ends up in an underworld filled with strange characters. He finds a job skewering meat in a dirty old room in a shabby old house filled with prostitutes, gangsters and a weird old tattoo master. He clearly doesn&apos;t fit in to this new world, and the inhabitants of it immediately despises him. In this way, the movie is very comic and entertaining. But when he meets a beautiful young girl with a tattoo out if this world, the story takes a turn. The girl wants to flee this dark and dirty world, and she needs his help. Eventually the writer has to come to terms with who he is, and where he belongs. The girl is astonishingly played by Terajima Shinobu who won a Japanese Academy Award in 2003 because of this movie. Another good thing about this movie is the beautiful scenery during the last scenes at the waterfalls. That said, the movie is too long and not all of the scenes work or make sense. Nonetheless a very beautiful and interesting piece, and Terajima Shinobu shines on the silver screen.",

      "reviewBody": "LAURA is, quite simply, as good as it gets as far as &quot;film noir&quot; is concerned. \n\nAside from an interesting story, a witty script, excellent B&amp;W photography of elegant sets and the beautiful Gene Tierney as the center of attention, it works on every level imaginable. Dana Andrews has an intriguing role as the detective drawn to the portrait of Laura after believing her dead. And Clifton Webb has his star-making role of Waldo Lydecker, the snobbish and elegant man who seems just as obsessed with the dead woman as the detective. Adding to the impressive performances are Judith Anderson and Vincent Price.\n\n The only flaw seems to be that Laura herself is not as well-defined in motives and background as the other players. But Gene Tierney&apos;s mesmerizing beauty hardly makes that important. Nevertheless, she is too passive in the role and actually gave far stronger performances in films like The Razor&apos;s Edge and Leave Her to Heaven, something she herself admitted--but her looks were never used to better advantage.\n\nWith several plot twists and turns, it keeps you thoroughly absorbed until it reaches its satisfying climax under Otto Preminger&apos;s knowing direction. Not to be missed, it&apos;s a classic of its kind.\n\nFor a detailed look at the career of DANA ANDREWS, see my current article on him in FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE, Summer 2001 with a look at all of his films and many photos."

Real and enormously moving. Tommy Lee Jones gives us a face we hadn&apos;t seen before. Someone so settled in his ways that he doesn&apos;t notice what&apos;s happening around him. That&apos;s why, I though, his realization is so poignant. The film is based on a solid script but the direction is sluggish and uncertain to say the least. It feels as if the director didn&apos;t trust his material. The songs and the score, out of a Lifetime TV movie, doesn&apos;t allow us to connect with the real truths unfolding in the screen. That, I must confess, was very annoying. I recommend the film on the strength of the two central performances. Intimacy between two grown ups reflected on every look on every move until the score comes to interfere and derail our emotions.",

      "reviewBody": "As a German, I am quite proud of movies from my native country. Sure, German films aren&apos;t as successful as American or French films, nor did they revolutionized a specific genre, like the Italian spaghetti-westerns, but compared to many countries, German movies have high production values. So, naturally, let me review the worst German film I have seen.\n\nBlueprint is a drama, directed by Rolf Schübel, based on a novel written by Charlotte Kerner, by the same name. The film is about cloning, and which struggles someone has to face, when being the perfect clone of another person. The main character, Iris Sellin (played by Franka Potente) is a famous and successful pianist, who has multiple sclerosis. To prevent her from dying, she decides to take part in a scientific experiment, which makes her able to clone herself, to let her piano talent transport to her clone (just don&apos;t ask). After 13 years her clone, Siri (oh, how very creative), finds out that she isn&apos;t a normal, individual child, but rather a cloned, younger version of her mother (because she couldn&apos;t figure that out earlier, based on her facial features, her piano talent without learning and that her name is just her mother&apos;s name in reverse). The plot is very predictable, pseudo-dramatic, pseudo-tragic and pseudo-society-critical. There are also too many sub-plots, pointless characters and plot-holes.\n\nThe acting in Blueprint is just terrible! Franka Potente both plays Iris and adult Siri. Even if the movie is supposed to be a drama, Potente is just emotionless all the time. Ullrich Thomsen, who plays the scientists, who clones Iris, also has a very boring and pointless role. However, it&apos;s the character Greg Lucas (who doesn&apos;t even appear in the novel), played by Hilmir Snær Guðnason, that annoys me the most. Terrible acting, stupid dialog and no significance to the plot whatsoever, contribute to one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a movie.\n\nIn total, this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It isn&apos;t even bad in a funny kind of way, so it doesn&apos;t even qualify as fun trash. A boring, nonsensical story, with amateur acting and idiotic characters. It tries too hard, to be intelligent or deep, but fails to deliver. 1/10",

The strongest aspects were the performances from the entire cast with Anna Kendrick and Vincent Piazza being standouts. Of course, the fine work of Reese Thompson will be rewarded by the praise he deserves (and hopefully awarded).\n\nBut this deeply personal film has many fine moments, both hysterically funny and painfully revealing. Because it refuses to be predictable--even in the final moments--I believe it will stand above other films of this genre. A well chosen score will keep it from becoming dated. It&apos;s never glib towards a range &quot;bent&quot; characters, and chooses to leave the smart remarks for the characters and not the film itself. Despite the subject of repressed anger and expressed rage, there&apos;s a sweetness that avoids the sentimental.\n\nClearly Jeffery Blitz needed to tell this story. And I hope he has many more for us in the future.",

Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors&apos; performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.\n\nOriginal films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn&apos;t caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.\n\nAs I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn&apos;t a cheap trick to make the movie more &quot;intelectual&quot;, it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn&apos;t be missed.",

      "name": "a contradiction in terms: Dostoyevsky by way of Bresson, but somehow it works, affectingly, a tale of doomed possession",
      "reviewBody": "Robert Bresson would be the last filmmaker I would think to adapt any story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a man who might be the greatest writer of melodrama- and melodrama as in gut-wrenching, emotional stuff, with a characters in, for example, Crime and Punishment having a big screaming or dramatic fit, all described in massive amounts of painstaking detail (mostly so Dostoyevsky could get paid by the word, perhaps). Because Bresson was a filmmaker who was completely uncompromising for what his vision required: usually non-professionals, saying dialog with a passive, almost restrained quality, with emotion held back until the most necessary (if at all) moments. Bresson was even on record once saying he didn&apos;t like sets or actors for that matter. But with Dostoyevsky&apos;s story he crafts another work that is all his own while honoring the harsh view on the human heart that the author had. It&apos;s a story where one might be tempted to take the woman&apos;s side, or (arguably) that she even did the right thing for herself at the end (or, as we at the start, at the beginning told backwards), but it&apos;s never that easy.\n\nA Gentle Woman leans more to searching for common sense where there is none: Elle is a simple girl in a family that doesn&apos;t treat her well (we don&apos;t see this, we just hear it second-hand), and has a gentle quality (or &apos;meek&apos; as Dostoyevsky&apos;s story was originally titled) that somehow allures Luc, who works as a pawnbroker. He pursues her, even though she&apos;s not much interested in his advances (&quot;I told you not to follow me,&quot; she says to him as he follows her up to his house, in a tone soft but firm). He marries her. They seem momentarily at peace, but this soon breaks: Luc is continually insecure with himself, in a sense, because he can never feel secure in his relationship. Unlike That Obscure Object of Desire, where there was a mind-game involving the sex in the possessive relationship, there&apos;s no question that they do go to bed. It&apos;s the whole factor of what&apos;s really there in terms of trust, love, redemption, and above all a connection between two people. A scene that could be in a silent film (a form Bresson desperately would love to have tried), the couple are watching a film in a theater, and she is sitting next to a guy on her other side. Luc can&apos;t stand this, and almost on instinct he stands so the two can switch. A glance, or a couple of glances, speak a thousand ideas in a Bresson film.\n\nIn fact it&apos;s Bresson&apos;s attempts, as in other films, to try and intellectualize an emotional downward spiral that gains interest. Because it&apos;s the opposite of your usual melodrama, where the characters get all excited and angry and yelling and lots of misunderstandings and so on, the style is stripped down, leading to what is a much more distressing relationship they&apos;re in. Neither one can give in, but Elle just can&apos;t seem to leave him or go through an affair. And Luc likewise can&apos;t seem to ever go to lengths of domestic violence or on the flip-side leaving him. It&apos;s all about him having her, not the other way around, and the moments that she tries and asks him about his past doings (i.e. being fired from a bank teller job) he hesitates. There&apos;s a mold in shape that he can&apos;t seem to break of her, and by the time he goes for it and says over and over &quot;I love you&quot; it&apos;s clear as day- she&apos;s already past that point saying &quot;I thought you were going to leave me.&quot; Enigmatic, maybe, it depends on the viewer.\n\nIt might be understandable this is one of Bresson&apos;s least available selections (no DVD yet, and a very paltry availability on the internet quarters of VHS sales), even though it shouldn&apos;t be. It&apos;s a fascinating experiment in dissecting character through narrative (albeit Bresson cuts back and forth between Luc at Elle&apos;s dead body at the bed a wee bit much through good narration from him), and in revealing little things about the relationship for a modern audience. There&apos;s a subtext I liked that dealt with diversions, theater, television, films, that are like little respites for the two of them (for Elle more-so, as we see with her interest in Hamlet). And, of course, the Catholic dimension of feeling- from Dostoyevsky carried over into Bresson- is felt more that almost any other of his films; divorce, it seems, is never called into question. This makes it dangerously close to being behind-the-times with its ultimately tragic fate for the characters.\n\nBut it also puts up an ultimatum of morality, not just for Luc but for Elle in hindsight: the film doesn&apos;t condone suicide, for all of the poetic splendor it&apos;s revealed in at the start and finish (not to mention that amazing final shot of the coffin being nailed in). Many interpretations, existential, feminist, even Marxist to a smaller extent, could be taken into account. One thing is for certain: A Gentle Woman isn&apos;t an easy film to digest, but for those willing to give it a shot it offers some intriguing layers beneath the subdued manner. By the way, watch for the scene that finally comes up that was taken for the (somewhat misleading) video cover; it&apos;s a total 180, aside from the basic initial physical motion, of a similar scene in Goodfellas!",

      "reviewBody": "Chul-ki is released from prison, and begins a ruthless quest of vengeance, working his way up a group of gangsters toward his main targets, Axe and Ghost-face. Slowly throughout the film, we learn the reasons behind his quest for revenge. He encounters a young girl, Tae-Yeon, who has her own reasons for wanting revenge against the gangsters.\n\nIt was a pretty good film, moving at a good pace and did not overstay its welcome at a brief 89 minutes. The settings were interesting and matched the bleak and violent story line, from an abandoned apartment block, to an old factory, to an stark quarry. It explores themes of revenge, as in previous Korean films like the (much better) Old Boy and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.\n\nAll in all, it was worth watching, though not the best of the genre.",

      "reviewBody": "In January, 1902 a troop of soldiers of the Japanese Imperial army are sent on a march over Mt. Hakkoda, in the north part of the main island, to gain winter training in preparation for the upcoming war with Russia. It ends in the worst mountain disaster in Japanese history, with 199 of the 210 men perishing in a severe snowstorm. The trek was ill fated from the start, with the officers stuck in their own rigid thinking. They thought they knew best, and if the men weren&apos;t tough enough to survive a march through the woods, they didn&apos;t deserve to serve the Emperor. And all those warnings from the locals? They were mere peasants, not worth listening to. This film, based on the &quot;documentary&quot; novel by Jiro Nitta, has some powerful images. One that I&apos;ll never forget is the scene of several trying to climb up a steep icy slope. One loses his grip and slides down, taking others along with him. A few go crazy and strip to their loincloths. Others just drop dead. There&apos;s no fire and very few provisions. Keeping them going are ironic visions of the area in the late spring and the beautiful guide they met.",

      "reviewBody": "Le Paltoquet, a typical whodunit, is an interesting lesson in nihilism. First of all, the characters have no names. They are referred to as &apos;the journalist&apos; or &apos;the doctor&apos;. Secondly, there is no real set. Sure, there is a hall, there are chairs, tables and a bar, but that&apos;s all. There is nothing to hide the fact that it is not a real bar but a studio. This brings Le Paltoquet as close as possible to a filmed stage version.\n\nIt reminds me of Dogville, but I enjoyed it a lot more. These actors have to compensate for the emptiness of the sets with their charm. The best part is that all kinds of famous French actors, Daniel Auteuil, Michel Piccoli, Jean Yann, Jeanne Moreau and Fanny Ardant were likely enjoying this experiment. The famous actors in Dogville probably did that as well, but somehow that movie lacked cheerful anarchism and gave me the feeling that most of the actors probably played in that film to boost their resumes. \n\nI treasure the bizarre moments when Piccoli presses a button and puts everything on hold. Just as the bartender provides the thrilling music himself by turning on a pick-up and pointing towards the door where the commissioner comes bursting through. The film does indeed have some shortcomings, the dialogue is not that sparkling, and the characters remain flat, but simply getting a experimental film made like this was a great feat."

He asked me if I wanted to watch it and having suffered from his previous choices (THE FAMILY STONE, THE SKELETON KEY...), I wasn&apos;t about to say yes but then he gave me no other options and I had to sit through another miserable cinematic experience. And, wow, this one was bad! 40 minutes into the movie and my friend looked at me and said that he couldn&apos;t follow anything and nothing made sense. I couldn&apos;t agree more with him. The story and or direction rarely made any sense whatsoever. It tried to be eclectic and cute but ended up looking amateurish and confused. What was Daniel Craig thinking when he agreed to do this? Something was probably lost in translation here because the level of absurdity over the Daniel Craig character&apos;s obsession with the Niagara tightrope walkers was risible and not credible at all. We couldn&apos;t take any of it seriously, and that includes the dialogue, the acting, the flat direction and whatever story there was here. It is good hearted but that&apos;s not enough to make up for the absurdity of it all.\n\nThere&apos;s a love scene at the beginning which made both of us laugh out loud at the same time. We went &quot;Well, that was fast&quot;.\n\nSuffice to say, my friend was really bummed out after watching this inexplicably awful film, more than me because, knowing my friend&apos;s luck with movies, my expectations were already pretty low to begin with.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Amadeus&quot;, while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliant film.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at his most remarkable: genius.  Mozart&apos;s genius was at the highest level, on par with Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when he undertook translating Peter Shaffer&apos;s play.  Although most of the acting is on a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not should they be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from the central thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has been entrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in the movie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musical genius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his father show a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, they are not paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A. Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately, the film gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: the great C Minor Mass, the Requiem and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.  Forman realized that no human being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen such masterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly true of Shakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration of genius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too much for the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanks to Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius to shine through.  In that sense, &quot;Amadeus&quot; is an exercise in humility.  Few films come across as blessings for those who experience them.  &quot;Amadeus&quot; is one such film."

      "reviewBody": "Sexy Beast is a funny and highly enjoyable crime movie punctuated by some blood curdling violence.  The film was directed by Jonathen Glazer, who was responsible for most of the recent amazing Guinness beer adverts.\n\nRay Winstone is Gal, a retired criminal enjoying retirement in Spain with friends and the woman he loves.  But this is shattered by the arrival of a menacing figure from his past in the shape of pyschotic Don Logan (played with evil intensity by Ben Kingsley).  Don wants Gal for one last spectacular job and will do just about anything to get him, including threatening Gal&apos;s beloved wife.\n\nThe story is told at a fast pace, with several surreal interludes but never loses momentum.  Ray Winstone puts in another loveable badboy performance that he does so well, but the film is dominated by Kingsley who steals every scene he is in and creates one of the most menacing screen villains in recent memory.  The brilliance of the film is that it manages to combine so many disparate elements (thriller, comedy, and a touching love story to say the least) into a cohesive and highly entertaining whole.  A real pleasure to watch and a striking, brilliant debut."

I don&apos;t want to explain my meaning as I don&apos;t wish to spoil the story or your entertainment in figuring it out.

      "reviewBody": "Where do I start? The plot of the movie, which is about a love between two high school students during wartime, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi which was also turned into an anime in 2002, both of which I have yet to read or see.\n\nThis review is about this live action adaptation however. Sadly, this honest to goodness was a terrible movie. It isn&apos;t as if one could site certain aspects, and say, for instance, the budget is at fault, or the acting is to blame. It is, sadly, a series of underwhelming and ineffectual elements that bring this film down.\n\nThe acting is poor. Not to say Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn&apos;t have much to work with, and seemed miscast. Neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degree.\n\nThe script was weak, the leads act unrealistically, and behave irrationally. The film also plays for the heartstrings, but ends up being predictable, all the while not being compelling, and under-developing the characters. There are also pacing issues.\n\nVisually, it is unremarkable. The film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. The other special effects also have a cheap look to them, especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used. There is also no visual flair, as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating.\n\nThe music and sound effects were fine, but unremarkable.\n\nOverall, the movie isn&apos;t devoid of enjoyment, and fans of the series shouldn&apos;t be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion. People unfamiliar with Saikano, this probably isn&apos;t the place to jump in as it isn&apos;t a very good movie or melodrama. It isn&apos;t the movie or the cast and crews fault, it just isn&apos;t inspired, and that is what kills it.",

      "reviewBody": "Piaf&apos;s tumultuous life receives a superb framework in this excellent biopic. I&apos;ve read some criticism of Dahan&apos;s editing style which switches often to various parts of her all-too-brief life, but with a woman of such roiling emotions and dramatic upheavals, how could it not be so? The two things I found missing here were her WWII Resistance activities and her final marriage to a man twenty years her junior. But then again the film might have approached the three- hour mark and at nearly two and a half, you walk away feeling as though you witnessed a train wreck in slow-mo. Please do not let this prevent you from seeing an astonishingly fine recreation of a life that is so fully lived you cannot believe it. Piaf&apos;s magnificent, emotional singing is fully complemented by Cotillards balls to the wall performance. Heart and soul are in total sync here and Cotillard manages to age astonishingly well. This is a terrible tale of a child grotesquely abandoned emotionally by her parents. Piaf&apos;s will to live is inspiring even in the face of self-destruction that makes Judy Garland&apos;s own battles with alcohol and drugs seem minor in comparison. The parallels to both women are hard to ignore. The rest of the cast is first-rate, and the film beautifully evokes the eras covered in her life. Best of all there is the great Piaf recorded legacy which is well-handled here. There&apos;s no sense that Cotillard is not singing and that&apos;s a testament to the skill that suffuses this fine film. Excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "... but I was mostly laughing at the film instead of with it.\n\nAs the film opens, Victor Frankenstein (Ralph Bates) is in medical school in 19th century Austria. After he makes a fool out of a professor and class ends, a classmate asks him &quot;What&apos;s hypochondria?&quot; A female classmate volunteers to help him in anatomy; a male&apos;s offer is declined. After Victor&apos;s father (George Belbin) says he&apos;ll die before he wastes money to send Victor to Vienna to study, Victor arranges for his death. After Victor becomes Baron Frankenstein, he goes off to Vienna to study. The film follows a well-worn, mostly predictable path from here.\n\nThe picture has elements that had to be intentional parody. There&apos;s a team of husband-wife grave-robbers (Dennis Price and Joan Rice) who do battle while they dig into graves, and complain they aren&apos;t getting paid enough. Alys (Kate O&apos;Mara), who is maid and mistress for the father and later his son, is made to be a dreadful cook who all the characters complain about in the course of the movie.\n\nBut then there are things like characters who live in the castle forgetting where Frankenstein&apos;s laboratory is (upstairs); the maid refers to it being upstairs and downstairs. The creditors of a victim&apos;s father refers to her owing &quot;about $12,000 bucks&quot; . The victims are all predictable; just listen to their lines. For those in the audience who needed more help, the women with the lowest cut dresses in the thinnest material are sure to die. Director Jimmy Sangster makes sure there are plentiful bosom shots.\n\nThe Monster&apos;s (David Prowse) appearance is unique. He&apos;s blond, is wearing only what looks like a iron dog collar around his neck and white underwear, has stitches all over and looks like he&apos;s spent all his time working out at the local gym. Was he Mel Brooks&apos; inspiration for the Monster in 1974&apos;s &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; and the inspiration for the Monster in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1976)?? Don&apos;t feel too bad for Prowse. In 1977 he is the physical presence of Darth Vader in Star Wars even if James Earl Jones is his voice.\n\nBates, O&apos;Mara, and Carlson deliver professional performances, although Veronica Carlson seems to be fighting a case of the giggles. Price and Rice are the intentional delights of the film as the bickering grave-robbers.\n\nThe film still has the expected Hammer elements, and looks good. This should be a terrible film, but it&apos;s more entertaining than it has any right to be. I laughed more at this than at some so-called comedies.",

I would rather say that it&apos;s a thriller, particularly well done, which features Emily Browning, an amazing actress who plays well throughout the film. All the supporting roles are equally compelling, from the creepy stepmother to the protective sister and the ambiguous father.\n\nBut the real strenght of The Uninvited is its ending : completely unexpected, it is very well brought and remains logical with everything that has been showed to us previously, if we watch the whole thing again. A very nice surprise for me! 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was of a real interest to me as it was produced by the same producer as Green Street, and having watched it I feel more informed, if a little frustrated.\n\nThe film centres around the character of Cass Pennant, a real life hooligan and 80&apos;s icon for hooliganism. Adopted into a white family, in an age of racism and violence, Cass finds his natural environment in the place where you would have thought he would be the biggest victim.\n\nThe script is based on Cass Pennants book &apos;Cass&apos;, and you can&apos;t help but feel it was copied and pasted from novel to script. The main problem is that this could have been one of the best football thug films if they had managed to get decent actors. Not that they don&apos;t do a good job, its just not great. Nonso Anozie is pretty good as the main character Cass, its interesting to see a generally soft natured character flip out now and again in a hooligan film instead of the typical hot-headed cockney. The rest of the cast however don&apos;t support him very well, and it seems as though they are forcing the drama rather than acting in a biopic. \n\nOverall though, its an interesting insight into a real character in hooliganism, how he ended up, and kept going back, in the hooligan &apos;business&apos;. If you are looking for another rise of the foot-soldier or a football factory type film, then this may not be for you.",

Without their commentary it would have been very tough to sit through this crap.\n\nGreg Sestero from &quot;The Room&quot; has the lead, which must be the reason they picked this one, because most PM movies can be spoofed with ease. The fact that Sestero speaks with an idiotic French accent must have been an added bonus to choose this bad sequel as opposed to other bad sequels. This leads me to suspect that the reason he got this role is because he told the casting director that he is a fluent French speaker. (I read most of his autobiography i.e. The book about &quot;The Room&quot;.)\n\nThe puppets look more horrible than ever, as opposed to horrifying, and the &quot;Egyptian&quot; bad guys are the least ominous supernatural demons in the history of cinema. Based just on this laughable trio I would slap this turkey with a G rating. 3 year-olds would laugh at this movie."

As with other excellent cruel youth &quot;,&quot; in the year of fate murder scenes shot very well, after a long time to pave the way, while you are chewing Jiang Wen&apos;s performances, suddenly across the light knife. Very suddenly! At this point, you in addition to Bengchu a &quot;fuck me!&quot; In addition, only a mouth silly Leng copies of the.\n\nShoot the cruel movie of Xie Fei, is a very elegant and refined as director; Ang Lee to say &quot;personally in their own movie, this is Chinese 5000 years of sexual repression results&quot;, the refined Xie Fei ask Jiang Wen to help with his camera, expressed that age of sexual repression, the age of sexual repression. Here you have to praise Jiang Wen, more than and 20 years of age, can be so familiar, handy, which can only be used to explain the word genius.\n\nAt the age of 24, one of the second year of fate, the movie played by Jiang Wen, was released from prison, often moved by sight memories of some small things when the age of innocence, two wearing a red scarf children, walking on the tracks, and naive words. I remember when I was 24 years old, I like memories, memories of primary school, memories of the middle school, all kinds of bit by bit. In recent years, combined with the more popular online nostalgia 80s cartoon, series, snacks, games and things like that, I think of &quot;aspirin&quot; in a sentence: &quot;some people say that memories is a sign of aging, but now even the 80s people are desperate memories, so I said, memory is not a person the old logo, repeated memory is.&quot; The 24 year old should is not old, because that&apos;s when I was a student, and it is in my school days are not the most prominent what year is the beginning of mature age, but what is mature? Maybe it&apos;s just a euphemism for old age!\n\nFinally, to say that the film in 1989, a Chinese development of reform and opening up the good day, then there are a lot of films are love when things get. At the end of 80s and early 90s and is now a lot of love for the environment of the film, to show that time through a variety of symbolic elements, it seems strange hairstyle, disco, big horn recorder, vendors, etc., they are now the sixth generation person, there is no shortage of tablets. However, if you really want to feel like a pile of Qing Dynasty, the Qing emperor said it is not worth a look back to the eighty stones, find the nostalgic sense and the movie in twenty-first Century, rather than directly to the feelings of the films of the era of the original flavor, it is not a strong purpose the symbol, but purely natural expression.\n\nA group of film shots in the final, it is the inverse of people like Jiang Wen, bow down, at the end of this reminds me of the &quot;yellow earth&quot; before and after &quot;Farewell to My Concubine&quot;. Chinese film, or very much like the end of a very interesting.",

It makes one laugh, and laugh with great joy, but it also shows some wonderful Romanian landscapes, great old music, a way of life that mixes ancient rituals with up-to-date technology and the amazing beauty of people everywhere. The magic of the local speech is lost in translation, but the rest is easily accessible. The very fabric of these people&apos;s life is brought to the eye and it is charming. A straightforward celebration of life!\n\nIt made me think that this is what filming must have been originally: someone with a camera catching the sparkle of life around so that others might join in the appreciation of it. Stories and pictures. I think this is how Transylvanian Garlic was created. Add passion and talent and you get this fresh, funny, incredibly alive movie. If you get to talk with Radu Bazavan (the writer) or to Lucian Alexandrescu (the director) they might tell that all they wanted was people to have 90 minutes of fun. Don&apos;t get fooled: they did much more than that. They make you feel so alive that when the movie ends you want to see it again right then.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Umberto Lenzi is widely known for his raw and uncompromising films of a variety of genres, his doubtlessly most famous films being his gory and gruesome Cannibal flicks &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot; (1981) and &quot;Mangiati Vivi&quot; (1980). These are flicks one is not likely to forget, of course, but, as far as I am concerned, Lenzi&apos;s most memorable and brilliant achievements are his tough-minded and ultra-violent Poliziotteschi, such as &quot;Milano Odia, la polizia non pùo sparare&quot; (aka. &quot;Almost Human&quot;, 1974) or this &quot;Roma A Mano Armata&quot; (aka. &quot;Rome Armed To The Teeth&quot;/&quot;Brutal Justice&quot;) of 1976. &quot;Rome Armed To The Teeth&quot; is an action-packed fast-paced, brutal and breathtaking crime flick like it could only be made in Bella Italia, and a perfect proof for what gifted a director Lenzi was.\n\nEven more than the foregoing &quot;Milano Odia...&quot;, this delivers the absolute opposite of political correctness. Commissario Leonardo Tanzi (Maurizio Merli) is a super-tough and relentless cop with a mustache, whose unorthodox methods make Dirty Harry look like a peace-loving social worker. Respectless towards his (hypocritical) superiors and without any form of sympathy for offenders, Tanzi hates criminals as much as he hates crime, and he has no scruples to beat information out of suspects and bend the law whenever it is necessary to do the right thing. Tanzi is super-tough and the role seems as if it was written for Maurizio Merli. The great Tomas Milian (one of my personal all-time favorite actors) plays &apos;Il Gobbo&apos;, a hunchbacked and psychotic gangster. Milian is excellent in any role I see him play, and this particular role of the malicious and sadistic criminal fits him like a glove. Apart from Merli and Milian, who are both excellent in their roles, the cast includes a bunch of other regulars of Italian genre-cinema, such as Giampiero Albertini, who plays a cop, Luciano Catenacci, and, most prominently, Ivan Rassimov as a sleazy drug dealer. The film contains a vast amount of sleaze and brutality, and is definitely not for those who are very sensitive when it comes to violence. For my fellow lovers of Italian genre-cinema from the 70s, however, this is an absolute priority. The score by Franco Micalizzi is absolutely brilliant, the cinematography is excellent, and the film is tantalizing from the beginning to the end. Tough-minded and gripping throughout, &quot;Roma A Mano Armata&quot; is an ultra-violent and wonderfully politically incorrect Poliziottesco that no lover of Italian-genre cinema can afford to miss. In short: Brutal, brilliant, and an absolute must-see for all fans of Italian Crime cinema!",

The starting scene awakes all your senses and maybe you could keep quiet at the end of the screening. It&apos;s a beautiful chant for loss things that Lacuesta&apos;s films like they were impossible dreams. Many great moments, some drops of Depardon, mixed with Guerin and maybe Kiarostami gave birth a masterpiece and one of the most exciting movies of the year. I am Spanish and i don&apos;t like flamenco... this wonderful film makes me doubtful. I ask myself questions about things that i believed that don&apos;t interest me. It&apos;s the effect of art.",

      "name": "Good spaghetti western tale, but with direction often lacking in substance",
      "reviewBody": "This film starts with that Almeria backdrop that we love so much. Ringo (Anthony Steffen) and his colleague Davy (Eduardo Fajardo) rescue Fidel (Armando Calvo) from a certain death at the hands of a posse of gun-hands. Their motive? Well it had nothing to do with Fidel&apos;s safety, but an assumption that there must be a reason that the gang would be so keen to pursue him.\n\nThis intuition is well founded. Once they have rescued Fidel for a second time - after a full on bar brawl - they discover that he has a map tattooed on his back. It turns out to be just half of a map for hidden gold, with the second half on the back of a crook-turned-sheriff following a pact whilst the two were captive in prison. The aptly named &quot;Trikie&quot;(Frank Wolff) has overheard the conversation, and insists on joining the three on the trail of the gold. The group successfully track down the Sheriff, who double crosses them - the first of many double-crosses as they follow the map and the film develops.\n\n&quot;Ringo - Face of Revenge&quot; is pretty watchable, although in truth fairly average spaghetti fare. With not a hint of revenge! The story itself has many twists and turns that successfully kept my attention, but the actual delivery of Caiano&apos;s direction seemed often lacking. I couldn&apos;t help feel that certain scenes were simply added in to cement the gaps in the story, and help the viewer realise what was actually going on (but unfortunately the cement was weak and lacked substance).\n\nThat said, there are some great scenes - my favourite being the moment when the captured group decide that the only way to prevent the double crossing sheriff from learning the secret of the other half of the map is to burn the tattoo off of Fidel&apos;s back. Ouch! As far as the acting is concerned, Fajardo really excels in the role of the eccentric Davy. Both Wolff and Steffen on the other-hand both appear quite subdued (although, I guess that was largely Steffen&apos;s style).\n\nIf you enjoyed &quot;Some Dollars for Django&quot; you will probably enjoy this movie also, as it has a similar feel (and not just because of Steffen&apos;s lead role). To me it remains in that group of westerns that I quite enjoy watching, but would be in no particular rush to watch again.",

Secondly, while we in the western world deplore communism, it is very silly and idiotic to treat it as a contagious disease, to be repelled and avoided at all costs. With our wealth, freedom of expression and using an open-door policy, we can show the people in the Communist countries or countries about to go Communist that our system is better and in every way offers people more freedom, pleasure and security. \n\nI think this film should be shown whenever and wherever people come to see the Vietnam Monument in Washington",

      "reviewBody": "Jackie Chan walks us through a series of stunts and tricks of his trade. This includes the man himself showing us how the main stunts are carried out and how individual scenes in several films were planned and put together.  A narrator also takes us into Jackie&apos;s stunt lab where stunt men show the importance of timing and the little things that make it all look so very good.\n\nWhen I saw this film coming on TV I knew it was going to be about the `how to&apos; rather than a best of compilation.  I was right  the film picks several films (including The Young Master, Who Am I and Rush Hour) and looks at key scenes and what went into them.  This is interspersed with Jackie addressing the camera and talking generally about his style.  It sounds dull but it is actually very good.\n\nI found it interesting because I never realised how very difficult these fights were to put together and all the little things that Jackie considers when doing them.  The most interesting bits are on set stuff that I didn&apos;t know (like the difficulties in getting the performers on the roof in Who Am I to get their timing right) but mainly Jackie talking.  He is very interesting at the worst of times but he is always very good when he is talking about his craft.\n\nSome viewers will be upset that it isn&apos;t full of great stunts and outtakes but it does what it is suppose to do well.  Some of it is poor  the narrator telling us what a green screen is in a voice like she&apos;s talking to children is a real low, but as long as Jackie is either talking or doing his thing then this is very watchable.\n\nOverall this is a must for all fans and has lots of `oh, I didn&apos;t know that&apos; moments albeit over a small selection of films.  Not perfect but pretty interesting."

De Sica and ghini&apos;s acting is the usual and even if the characters are slightly different they don&apos;t add nothing of good to it. No surprise here. The MTV-generated boys, Mandelli and Ruffini, confirm their involvement in the series after they first joined in last year&apos;s movie, and even if you can notice some improvements in their screen presence, they still need some more practice. The new guys are Bisio and De Luigi. They both build their characters on those they performed in years of TV appearances (weared out, if i may say), and sadly, because Bisio can be a great actor (La cura del gorilla, i.e.), only De Luigi succeeded in coming out with the &quot;funnier&quot; performance. It&apos;s fun to notice how the American cinema had an influence on this movie: there is an almost literal citation of There&apos;s something about Mary, and even a moment when a scene of American wedding is instantly reminded. In the end, a lot of potential, but the same bad script that leaves to the actors the duty of filling the gaps, but with things that we already saw.",

It&apos;s not. It is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.\n\nThere aren&apos;t too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which the &quot;When you&apos;re as criminal as I&quot; bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from.",

      "reviewBody": "The long-delayed young adult book adaptation finally shows up on big screen. Asia noticeably has an earlier release date. The question now is &quot;Is it worth the wait?&quot; For a movie delayed this long, people have already forgotten about it so I won&apos;t be surprised if it flops at box office. This gets as generic as what a fantasy period film can be. It is packed with every cliché you find in the genre however it is still entertaining with its action set pieces, decent CGI and 3D.\n\nThe story: Jeff Bridges plays a gruff Master Gregory who has lost his apprentice (Kit Harington) during a fight with a powerful witch (Julianne Moore). Thomas Ward (Ben Barnes) is chosen to be Gregory&apos;s new apprentice. And there you go, an action-packed adventure with perilous monsters and witches lurking. Nothing in the movie surprises, even the twists have been seen before. There are a few set pieces including a full-blown climax that use extensive CGI. Although entertaining to watch, they are lacking in the creativity department. Acting wise is alright. Music is generic but does elevate a sense of peril during the action.\n\n3D: It is surprisingly decent. I thought it would be another sloppy post-converted 3D movie that barely has depth. The 3D effects work the most during the CGI set pieces with monsters chomping right at your face. It has a reasonable amount of depth between characters and the background. \n\nOverall: Is it worth to watch it in cinema? Only if you are interested in young adult adaptations. If you don&apos;t, you are not missing much. It has all the clichés what a fantasy period movie has and does not break any new ground. Is it worth the wait? Probably not. But if you are in need of entertainment, this would just entertain you for 2 hours.\n\nMore on: http://moreviewsed.blogspot.sg",

      "reviewBody": "Despite an embarrassing scene at a restaurant, Jim proposes to his long-time girlfriend Michelle.  For their wedding Jim enlists the help of Finch and Kevin to make everything smooth  and keep Stifler out of the way.  However a ceremony is hard work and is made harder when things just always seem to go wrong and when Stifler seems to be determined to f**k the bride&apos;s sister  even if it means pretending to be mild mannered and polite.\n\nTrying to think about this film or the series itself is like trying to argue with mud, basically you just need to accept that this is a silly, stupid gross out comedy that relies on poor taste jokes and unlikely set ups.  If this is a problem for you then don&apos;t watch it.  If you have accepted it and are watching it then it all comes down to, is it a GOOD gross out comedy with poor taste jokes?  As much as I know I should be above it, I did laugh at the other 2 films and was happy to go and see this and, for the most part, I laughed at this.  However this was the weakest of the three and the silence in the cinema was quite often uncomfortable  usually silence in a cinema is a good thing, but this was often an uncomfortable `I should be laughing more&apos; type of silence.\n\nIn my review of part 2 I said `lets not do a 3&apos;.  Watching this I&apos;m sort of glad they managed to do it but I can see the strain despite their best efforts.  The main set up sequences are gross and funny but the gaps between are where the silence comes, there ain&apos;t enough comedy to cover the whole film.  I&apos;m not talking about the sweet stuff near the end, I just talking about all the scenes between the banner scenes.  Plus the sequences are very forced at times (many you can see coming for miles), but this isn&apos;t too bad as they still manage to be hilariously gross!  For those who like the nudity (and who didn&apos;t like the bi-sexual teasing scene from part 2?) there is a long sequence of strippers with large fake breasts, if that&apos;s your thing (I&apos;m a man, so yes!) which is funny but also serves up the mandatory t&amp;a. There are also some scenes that are TOO forced  eg the dance in the gay bar is funny but is too long and feels like a good idea with average delivery.\n\nThe film bravely loses something like half the cast and makes the film better in that regard.  In fact Kevin has so little to do that they could have lost his character all together.  However this is offset by the change to Stifler.  In the first 2 he is obnoxious and rude but he is also the brunt of more jokes than he is the punisher.  In the first half here, he is very rude and annoying and you hate him for how he treats his friends.  That makes all his early antics hard to laugh at because now all you can see is a jerk hurting people.  In the second half this is less of an issue as he changes a little and gets what&apos;s coming to him (and how!).  I have a theory that Scott knows he has been pigeon holed in this role and is desperate to get out of it  in fact when I saw Bullet Proof Monk I did think to myself that he is just playing a kung-fu Stifler.  Knowing this I think he played Stifler at full volume so that his next role would be nowhere near this performance.  Thus he has a weird crazed sneer on his face, he is ultra cruel and rude and is a real jerk  hard to laugh with (but luckily still easy to laugh at).\n\nThe rest of the cast do quite well.  Biggs manages to make more of his role than the victim and is sensitive when he needs to be  I think it will be hard for him to shake off Jim (pardon the pun) but he shows he can do acting when he needs to.  Hannigan&apos;s innocent girlie voice is a little grating now and doesn&apos;t sit with her image as a woman  it suited her to be a geek. Luckily she doesn&apos;t have that much to do after the funny opening scene. Thomas is OK but Nicholas just kind of hangs around with a half smile of his face and nothing to do.  Levy is still brillant as Jim&apos;s Dad but misses his `awkward moment&apos; relationship (which they give him with Michelle to repeat it).  Jones is eye candy and the return of Stifler&apos;s Mon (forget her name) is pointless and a mistake that is happily kept to a few moments.\n\nOverall this is as poor a film as you expect  rude, in poor taste, lacking a strong plot or performances, but none of these things are really fair comments as the film still manages to be funny.  The character of Stifler makes the first half very hard to enjoy and there are too many bits that don&apos;t work or where I didn&apos;t laugh but I still laughed.  Many viewers will feel that the series has simply fizzled out despite it still being funny."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been two years since we last saw Dakota Fanning on the big screen here, in a film which was a adaptation of the literary classic Charlotte&apos;s Web. And what a career it had been for this child actress, now an adolescent, to have grown from scream queen (no thanks to her stint under Spielberg&apos;s War of the Worlds) to one controversial role in Hounddogs, which I doubt would make it to our shores here.\n\nBased on a novel by Sue Monk Kidd and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, The Secret Life of Bees is one powerful drama above love and the looking for love, as well as running along the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation. It&apos;s easy to dismiss this as a chick flick because of its predominantly female cast, but that would be a mistake to make in making it an excuse to miss this film altogether. For all its worth, it&apos;s chock full of extremely well delivered performances from veterans such as Fanning herself, together with Queen Latifah, Jennifer Hudson (proving that she&apos;s no flash in the pan), Sophie Okonedo, Paul Bettany and even Alicia Keys!\n\nSet in the time of Summer in 1964 Southern USA where the Civil Rights Act was just signed and in effect, the sentiments amongst the racist bigots still run high in a charged environment still hanging onto their old segregated ways. Fanning&apos;s Lily Owens carries the weight of her guilt buried deep in her subconscious from a tragic event that happened when she was four, and ten years later, after receiving the last straw of punishment from her abusive dad (Bettany), runs away with her caretaker Rosaleen (Hudson).\n\nAs if led by an invisible hand, they soon find themselves under the extreme goodwill of the Boatwright sisters, who earn a living through the cultivation of bees for honey, and a series of incidents that bring about some tying of loose ends, and the discovery that these strangers do tie back to Lily&apos;s own quest to finding out the truth about her mom, to debunk the lies as told by her father. And of course this allows opportunity for some serious girl power bonding between the characters as they find that they have a lot more in common, as well as the sharing and spreading of love through their ranks.\n\nThe trump card that this movie has, is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast. Fanning leads the pack and gives a wonderful moving performance as the gangling Lily, who thinks that she&apos;s quite a jinx with plenty of bad karma to go around, bringing about unfortunate happenings to her hosts which provide the dramatic twists and turns to what would otherwise be a flat movie. Jennifer Hudson had much to do in the first act, though her character got quite muted by the time the trio of the Boatwright sisters August (Latifah), June (Keys) and Okonedo (May) come along. Queen Latifah brings about some serious gravitas in her role as the eldest with the largest heart, and you cannot deny her chemistry with Fanning. Keys on the other hand plays the sister the exact opposite of August, being aloof and starting off with intense suspicion as to the intent of their guests. And Okonedo&apos;s role could probably be the most unorthodox of the lot, a fragile soul who has her own wailing wall to deal with the harsh realities of life.\n\nThe Secret Life of Bees is well worth the admission ticket, and you&apos;ll be hard pressed not to be touched by the film, or moved by the themes it explores, especially when the third act comes by leading to quite a number of powerful revelations and a solid conclusion. Set against its intended backdrop, it&apos;s a reminder of tolerance, which the world lacks these days, and of course it&apos;s not always hammering in such heavy themes as it has its fair share of romance as well, and for what it&apos;s worth, Fanning has her first on-screen romance in this movie, and if I&apos;m right, has her first on-screen kiss as well.\n\nYou might be surprised when I say this, but this film has won me over enough for it to be considered as a contender when I shortlist my list of ten top films of the year. Definitely recommended!",

It follows Kennedy before arriving in Dallas as well as following Lee Harvey Oswald&apos;s footsteps. There is a small section for the actual shooting in the middle and then the aftermath dominates the second half. It&apos;s a very traditional documentary. There is a wall-to-wall old guy narration. It&apos;s timely released a year after the assassination. It got nominated for the Oscar. Its traditional newsreel style never really breaks and it follows the story mostly chronologically. The most compelling is probably hearing from Oswald himself and the foreboding description of his life. Basically, it&apos;s the standard documentary to encapsulate the event.",

      "reviewBody": "If you stop to think about the actual story you&apos;ll realise that it&apos;s the most ridiculous thing you&apos;ve ever seen. Fortunately William Wellman directs this at such breakneck speed you don&apos;t have time to stop - you&apos;re whisked along on the Wellman express.\n\nThat all this can happen in 68 minutes is crazy but this was Warner&apos;s specialty in the early thirties. They were brilliant at it and this is a great example. It&apos;s not a fantastic picture but it is so typical of those fast moving features of pure entertainment Darryl Zanuck knew his audiences would lap up. If good quality early thirties movies are your thing, this will tick your boxes. Even though the setting isn&apos;t the usual mean streets of New York, it&apos;s still got all the usual ingredients.\n\nA common ingredient of pre-code films that&apos;s present in this is the overriding importance of marriage. Although in pictures like this it&apos;s the single most vital thing in the world for a girl - which must have reflected reality, it seems completely unimportant who they marry as long as they can provide food and shelter. It&apos;s irrelevant whether he&apos;s a gangster, a decrepit pensioner or in this case, a complete stranger who advertised for a wife (essentially a housekeeper) in an agency. Disturbingly, mail order brides are still around today. Anyway...\n\nOne of those other usual key ingredients is George Brent. He&apos;s his usual dull self but for a change, that bland personality is suited to this role. Fortunately &apos;the other man&apos; in the love triangle is Lyle Talbot who always adds some slightly shady charisma. These two however are definitely second fiddle to the absolute star of this picture, Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nShe effortlessly melds her gangster-moll persona to devoted farmer&apos;s wife as though it&apos;s the most transition in the world. Were this role be played by a lesser actress (and directly a lesser director) it could have been a joke picture because the premise is so stupid but she (and Wellman) make it seem completely believable and therefore thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nAs in all her thirties pictures (apart from the monstrous Stella Dallas) despite not having the classic Hollywood looks, she inexplicably oozes enough sex appeal to fuel the planet for a hundred years. She certainly had &apos;it.&apos; This isn&apos;t one of her best films but it&apos;s still pretty decent - and she&apos;s absolutely lovely in it.",

The answer to this lies in the great performances of all main actors involved: Arthur Roberts, Traci Lords and Lenny Juliano. Each of them adapting very well to the sinister touch of this movie, each of them contributing to it. Their performances get extra depth by the down-to-earth play by Ace Mask (doctor) and Roger Lodge (policeman). Also added are a touch of sex and humor (birthday girl). As I said, the overall result is downright good. More so, &apos;Not from this earth&apos; is a great B-movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on Dian Fossey&apos;s own autobiography, this true life story is inspiring and has helped these amazing animals in many ways by waking us up to their plight. Originally Dian herself was helping to make the film, until she was murdered and the production team had to go back and start it all over again several years later in 1988. \n\nI am aware she did complete a degree when she returned to the USA in 1980 and wrote her book, which was published in 1983, and then revised in 1985. She returned to Africa in to help the gorillas and was murdered in 1984/1985 I believe near Christmas. \n\nShe may have done things that weren&apos;t ethical according to some, though her plight to save the gorilla came first. \n\nThis movie does give a fairly accurate but slightly toned down version of the events, which took place, though there were a few changes in details. It would be impossible to fit 13 years of events into just over one and a half hours of footage. So I think Hollywood did a good job.\n\nThe main alterations, leaving out some of the details of horrific animal abuse that would have otherwise pushed the rating up to an R16 and probably left any animal lover in tears. The details they left out as well may have made the film a little to shocking for the chief censors.\n\nThe special effects makeup, I believe done by Rick Baker, and real gorilla footage is seamless, making it hard to tell which parts were real gorillas and which are very well created costumes.\n\nAfter purchasing the DVD I now realize they had Dian Fossey&apos;s original tracker with them to help with the film.\n\nAll up I think this film gives us just enough drama, action and thrills to make it a hit. I think Sigorney Weaver should have won an academy award for this especially considering how brave she was to film on location with real gorilla right next to her.\n\nThis movie has inspired myself to change my career path and am also reading the book, which I would recommend for anyone who wants to see how much more horrific the events were in reality.\n\nThis movie is a must see, who knows it may even change your life."

      "reviewBody": "When I think of gay cinema, campy titles Too Wong Fu or I Love You Phillip Morris comes to mind, and so I am usually put off the idea of watching. However Eyes Wide Open is something totally different and quite intelligent. Here, life in a Jerusalem community is disrupted by the arrival of a young &apos;unorthodox&apos; Orthodox Jewish student who proceeds to seduce an older Jewish Orthodox man, who is married with four children. The narrative follows the progress of this conflicted husband coping with what is essentially a midlife crisis, while having to deal with the relationship issues of his neighbor&apos;s daughter, whose open &apos;secret&apos; affair with her boyfriend begins to mirror the problems developing in his own life.\n\nEmploying a minimalist feel supported by a soundtrack reminiscent Soderbergh&apos;s Solaris and incorporating the use of washed-out colors and stark lighting to convey a bleak realism, Eyes Wide Open&apos;s over the top premise is dealt with realistically and intelligently, never once turning the story into a tabloid spectacle. Although a lack of dialog from the main characters makes it difficult for the audience to truly understand their motivation, the story still provides an interesting insight into the moral conflicts some individuals may face, while being true to their family and themselves.\n\nThe only beef I have with this film is its 12 rating. There is some full nudity and a sex scene or two, which should have automatically given it a higher rating. Although its tastefully done and not pornographic in the least... it can make for an awkward viewing experience if watched with kids or someone more conservative.\n\nCheck my profile for my blog and more reviews of Middle Eastern and Western Cinema.",

That&apos;s not meant to be a put-down (if it was I&apos;d be putting down 2/3 of my movie collection). I really enjoyed this film.\n\nThe movie is directed by Umberto Lenzi, who is better known for his Euro-horror movies. The horror influence is clearly evident here when an escaped band of drooling lunatics runs around grunting and killing everyone in sight. It&apos;s a real hoot to see spaghetti western regular Eduardo Fajardo playing the part of a giggling homicidal idiot. This alone makes it worthwhile to seek out this film.\n\nJohn Ireland is great as the gunslinging preacher, and Piero Lulli makes a great villain as usual. The acting from the rest of the cast is not exactly top-notch, but that just adds to the flavor of this film. It&apos;s quite funny in parts (perhaps unintentionally but one can never be sure).\n\nThere are also some really funny lines in the movie, which I will not spoil by mentioning here. The way everyone overreacts to the fact that the hero likes to drink water is especially hilarious.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys both spaghetti westerns and strange, funny cult movies.",

The boys are in Mexico, where they get mixed up with Nazi agents.\n\nThis was the boys first production at MGM and frankly it looks like the big-budget studio wasn&apos;t sure how to duplicate the team&apos;s surging success over at Universal. That whirling car- lift is a heck of an effect, but is more impressive than funny. Then too, operatic singer Kathryn Grayson seems an odd choice for musical interludes in a knock-about comedy. In fact, it&apos;s a more high-profile supporting cast than usual, with John Carroll (Ricardo) getting as much screen time as A&amp;C.\n\nThere are, of course, some amusing bits as could be expected from the duo (mainly the puns), but the Nazi part is left sketchy without the menace it should have provided Costello&apos;s brand of comedy. This also looks like a try-out for the Volusia dancers. Their costumes are eye-catchers, but this is their only movie credit. Of the three MGM productions (Lost in a Harem, {1944}), and (A&amp;C in Hollywood, {1945}), this one in my view is the least. All in all, they really did belong at low-budget Universal where there was less concern with prestige."

However I just hated director&apos;s point of view about Istanbul, and Turkey. In some scenes you see some women wearing pitch black clothes as if they live in a country governed by Islamic rules . No!!! Turkey is not like that!!! Its constitution is more democratic than many &apos;democratic&apos; countries in the world. And especially women had their rights before many &apos;democratic&apos; countries in the world. For example Turkish women can vote or can be elected since 1934! Just check the history. You will see Turkish women had such rights before millions of others women living in other countries. But, I do not understand why there is not any Turkish women seen in the movie. All the movie was taken in very weird and suburban areas, and you do not see any women, but the guys. This is not Iran, this is Istanbul! I am very sorry about the director&apos;s attitude and I did not like it at all. \n\nTurkey is a secular, democratic and modern country. You can see the people with very modern looking all over the city, not ninjas! The people of Turkey do not wear such a pitch black clothes like the people living in an Islamic country. Not only the appearance, but also the thoughts are modern and contemporary in Turkey! Why did director say a big lie to the world? Is there a political reason? Should a director act like a horrible politician? \n\nI am fed up with seeing such horrible movies hiding the truth! Make movie of what you see, not hide the truth! \n\nMovie certainly deserves 7 out of 10, but the director does not deserve even 0! \n\nI hope my review was useful to correct some mistakes/lies about Istanbul...",

      "reviewBody": "I bought this movie from Criterion thinking a film accepted by them couldn&apos;t lead me astray (only later did I learn Armgageddon and The Rock were part of their collection), and boy was I wrong.\n\nThis is really one of the most pointless films I&apos;ve ever seen. It took a big risk trying with it&apos;s innovative non linear structure (ala Rashamon) and gambles like this are usually hit or miss; Rashamon was a hit, this was a miss.\n\nThe plot is quite similar to Rashamon in that it&apos;s told by four separate accounts of the same event, a murder of a prostitute by a soldier, a pimp and wife, a devious night club worker, and a punk kid who were all near the scene and interrogated as suspects. One of the chief problems though is it is missing characters who actually care or discuss what happened, making it hard for a viewer to relate to what he just saw.\n\nIn Rashamon the character&apos;s discussion at the beginning and end of the trial as it be validated the themes of that movie, not to mention the hollowed out building they sat in to avoid the rain was the chief visual metaphor of the film. There were constant cuts back to that structure throughout the length of the film.\n\nThe Grim Reaper really doesn&apos;t have that basis so the cinematography and editing just wander around aimlessly, and I use the word wander because the camera is quite free moving about in this film, apparently thats supposed to be one of the virtues of this film.\n\nOverall the central problem of this film is that it&apos;s non linear structure and subjective accounts of the same event generally just don&apos;t work unless there are common themes and setting throughout or any way for the audience to relate to what just happened. Normally if a film tells a good linear story with beginning to end plot it doesn&apos;t have to be particularly meaningful; this film put itself at risk by trying to be innovative and suffered the consequence.",

The cover and story are intriguing, and I am irrevocably drawn to it in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, this one will be different than the mountains of B schlock that I&apos;ve seen in the past. But alas, it just never happens.\n\nThis is one more on the pile of practically worthless movies I&apos;ve seen that have a great idea, but extremely poor execution. I am a horror fan, and love the premise of ghosts, haunted towns, and other supernatural elements in a movie when handled well. \n\nThe acting from the first frame was unconvincing and amateur, and proceeded throughout. Suspense was typically minimal and most of the &quot;horror&quot; moments were handled very sloppily. I will never grasp how such crap can manage to get funded. The producer(s) must take out a second mortgage or something else dire, and then roll the dice and hope that enough schmucks will shell out their hard earned cash to gobble up their vile stew. Hey, Blair Witch sucked and it made money, right? \n\nI must digress a moment and say that there were a few decent scare moments here and there, maybe one good gore bit to keep it from being a complete waste of one and a half hours of my life. It was also interesting to see a host of a show I enjoy called &quot;Cities of the Underworld&quot; on the History Channel have a bit part here. \n\nBut these fleeting moments do not make the experience worthwhile. If you must submit yourself to this &quot;film,&quot; and I use the term loosely, then get it for $0.50 at Family Video. Or just forget it and look for something that&apos;s bound to be better.",

      "name": "Yet another disappointingly routine Django western",
      "reviewBody": "Sergio Corbucci&apos;s original classic spaghetti western Django (1966) sure has a lot to answer for. In fairness, it&apos;s hardly Corbucci&apos;s movie&apos;s fault that countless Italian westerns that followed in its wake decided to simply name the lead loner/drifter after the main man and pretend that it was somehow a sort of follow-up. I&apos;ve seen a few of them now and the one thing I have noticed is that there is nothing that sets them apart from other spaghetti westerns whatsoever! For what it&apos;s worth, this one went out under the name Django Kills Softly, which aside from being a somewhat strange name, seems to have been an English language title – in the original the lead character seems to have been called Bill. So it appears that Italian producers must have quickly noticed that if they stuck &apos;Django&apos; or &apos;Sartana&apos; in their film&apos;s title then they would increase admissions by a few percentage points. \n\nNeedless to say, this is another very pedestrian and not memorable at all Italian western. In it Django&apos;s seeks vengeance after his friend is murdered by a bandit leader who controls a town through violence. To be honest, with a lot of these ultra-generic spaghetti westerns, you almost feel the writers simply randomly selected staple elements from a special &apos;spaghetti-western-generator&apos; (a cardboard box with a hole in the side full of bits of paper with Italian western clichés written on them) and wrote bits of exposition to join the pieces together. Even the titles sound like they have been randomly created by this high-tech machine! Whatever the case, this particular example of the genre is deeply unremarkable, yet professional enough to never fall below the level of mediocre. The one thing that does set it apart from others is in it having Django played by George Eastman (aka Luigi Montefiori), who is an actor who became known for playing very threatening villains in later 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s crime films, horrors and exploitation fare in general. He was quite well suited to these types of movie roles, so it was strange seeing him playing a western hero when he was a young guy. It&apos;s not really that much of a distinctive angle for this film to boast in fairness but it is at least something.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the known story of a man become into vigilante . An elderly ex-serviceman and widower , Harry Brown , (Michael Caine) looks to avenge his best friend (David Bradley)&apos;s murder by doling out his own form of justice . As a retired man turned vigilante and taking the law into his own hands as judge , jury and executioner. As every man has a breaking point . Harry turns the one-man vigilante when his friend is attacked , beaten and then stabbed to death in an underground passage carried out by furious band formed by some ominous punks . Then he stalks the slums of London and takes the law into his own hands, searching vengeance on crooks, hoodlums, druggies , muggers, pimps , making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum . Meanwhile , police officers D.I. Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and D.S. Terry Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles) are investigating the deeds and Police Superintendent Childs (Iain Glen) orders a major arrest operation believing the recent violence is related to a gang war. The late-night raids on the neighbourhood result in a massive riot .\n\nThis interesting picture has suspense , emotion , intrigue , thrills and lots of violence . It&apos;s certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Harry Brown&apos;s side . Michael Caine with his usual top-notch acting displays efficiently his weapon such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties . Michael Caine saw a lot of himself in the character of Harry Brown, e.g. they&apos;re both combat veterans , as Harry is a Marine who served in Northern Ireland, Caine served in the British Army during the Korean war , and Caine lived in the same area that Brown does , it was things like these that drew him to the film . Secondary cast is frankly excellent such as Emily Mortimer , Charlie Creed-Miles , David Bradley , Iain Glen , Sean Harris, Ben Drew and special mention to Liam Cunningham as Sid Rourke . This is Daniel Barber&apos;s nice feature debut , he&apos;s now shooting ¨The keeping room¨ with Hailee Steinfeld , Sam Worthington and Brit Marling .\n\nThis exciting and above average film belong to ¨Vigilante genre¨ whose main representations are ¨Charles Bronson&apos;s Death Wish¨ , successful crime thriller that created the Vigilante genre with Bronson as the main star such as ¨Death wish II¨ ¨Death wish III¨ , ¨Death Wish 4 : The crackdown¨and ¨Death Wish: The face of death¨ and , of course , ¨Clint Eastwood&apos;s Dirty Harry¨ movies , such as ¨The enforcers¨, ¨Sudden impact¨ and ¨The dead pool¨ . Furthermore , other notorious movies on the ¨Revenger¨ genre that achieved their splendor in the eighties are the followings : ¨Exterminator¨ I and II with Robert Ginty ; ¨Vigilante¨ by William Lusting with Robert Foster , Fred Williamson ; ¨Walking the edge¨ by Norbert Meisel with Robert Foster and Nancy Kwan ; ¨Dark Angel¨ with Betty Russell ; ¨Steele Justice¨ with Martin Kove ¨; ¨The Punisher¨ with Dolph Lundgren , ¨Joe Don Baker&apos;s Walking tall¨ saga ; ¨Lorenzo Lamas&apos;s Snake eater¨ saga , ¨Arnold&apos;s Raw Deal¨ , ¨Stallone&apos;s Cobra¨ and many others .",

      "reviewBody": "...&quot;Three Fugitives&quot; is an action comedy about an ex-con (Nick Nolte) who - on his first day out of prison - is taken hostage by a neurotic father (Martin Short).  The two are taken - along with Short&apos;s daughter (Sarah Rowland Doroff) - on a long journey full of laughs and excitement.\n\nNick Nolte is probably not the greatest actor for comedies, but he still delivers well.  Short is obviously hilarious, as he is most of the time, and Doroff is as good as she could be.  James Earl Jones and Alan Ruck also make funny appearances.\n\nThe only really annoying part about &quot;Three Fugitives&quot; is the constant use of eighties guitar music in the background.  That is probably the worst sounding noise in history.\n\nFunny family movie (despite a few cuss-words), 7/10."

      "reviewBody": "Scorsese has tried his best to recreate the glory of The Last Waltz but seems to have stumbled at the impossible: how can you recreate or better what is arguably the best concert movie of all time? Quite simply, you can&apos;t. The intro to this movie is as strange as its ending. There was obviously some sort of ruckus between Mick and Scorsese, because the lack of backstage footage and constant arguments between the two regarding camera, stage and setlists seemed to have set Scorsese on a &quot;I find it very hard to work with this diva&quot; twist on the movie.\n\nThis seems to dissipate with the beginning of the actual concert. Maybe he&apos;s trying to tell us that Mick&apos;s diva-esquire attitude and pointless demands fall apart and don&apos;t matter once they come onstage. It&apos;s all lost in the music.\n\nAs far as camera-work is concerned, this movie is well above most in terms of energy and fluidness (regardless of the lack of rehearsals Martin seems to emphasise). The two cameras behind the front row of people give a great sense of being in the crowd looking up at Jagger and Richards.\n\nThe gig itself is as good as any Bigger Bang tour I&apos;ve seen. Anyone who has seen the Stones live in the past 5 years knows exactly what to expect and they don&apos;t disappoint in this show.\n\nScorsese cuts to archive footage of the band being interviewed at certain times. As interesting as these are to see, they seem to not fit as effectively as the cut scenes in The Last Waltz did. They almost seem separate to the rest of the film.\n\nThe performances by Jack White and Buddy Guy are interesting. It seems like they appeared onstage unannounced and had no previous rehearsal with the band and just tried to play along. Especially for Buddy Guy. His usually inch-perfect solos and licks seem rigid and refrained. Its as if he&apos;s waiting for cues from the Stones that never come. Christina Aguilaira&apos;s appearance proves she certainly has talent in her well-trained voice, but seems like a strange cameo.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;d say this is a pretty decent concert movie, but nothing special in terms of movies in general. If you&apos;re a fan of the Stones, you&apos;ll enjoy this, but it won&apos;t shine any special light on the band themselves.",

Moira Kelley looked like a motherly angel and her husband was somewhat corny, but attractive and very fatherlike.    Hannah sure has changed from Splash where she looks much more older yet she still shows a style and insecurity in her character.   Hannah&apos;s character is presented as someone that is not completely evil,  yet her muscular rowdy husband appears to be the real headmaster of their brutal plans.    The violence in the movie isn&apos;t graphic and the love between Moira and Julie is wonderfully established. Hannah is silky smooth and appears to really fit the role of a dirty,   insecure woman.   I liked the way the movie made many connections of the theme like mother like daughter(also father) and the scenes when Julie used violence was quite surprising,  humorus, and actually thrilling.   The movie wasn&apos;t the greatest thriller,  yet the characters,  performances,  and scenes showed talent and I was satisfied with the rental.",

The movie stars out in 1899 with Henry Fonda playing a gunfighter named Jack Beauregard who just wants to get enough money so he can retire. Terence Hill plays another gunfighter named nobody who is obsessed with Beauregard. He&apos;s always following him around and wants him to fight the wild bunch, a group of 150 men, so he can be in the history books. This movie was produced by Serigo Leone and this was Henry Fonda&apos;s last western.",

      "reviewBody": "The earlier reviews have said it all, really. Both the script and plot are muddled, and several times I found myself thinking &quot;how come?&quot; and &quot;what&quot;. The curious accents can be attributed to dubbing in English and mock-Scottish, though in the version I saw on Youtube there were a couple of passages that hadn&apos;t been dubbed and were in the original Spanish.\n\nI&apos;m no military strategist, but some of the soldiers&apos; actions were odd. And I&apos;ve seen some long-range pistol shooting in Westerns in the past, but this film must have the record for the longest range - with snap shots fired from a galloping horse hitting Indians a couple of hundred yards away on the top of a canyon.\n\nSilvia Solar added very little, and the inevitable romance seemed to happen after the two parties had exchanged just half-a-dozen lines of dialogue.\n\nThe equally inevitable battle wasn&apos;t too bad, though the cannon seemed to fire off a lot of shots very quickly indeed.",

Along the way, he is given a choice of 3 options: have sex, hug, or talk. After choosing the sex option, he wakes up the morning where this begins. After multiple rounds of the time loop, trying hugging just defers the inevitable, to sex during the party. While Aaron finds snippets of information about Trevor over these time loops, they never have a deep discussion. Only when he fails to have sex with Trevor that the loop seems broken, but he enlists the help of his roommate / best friend / onetime lover to get back into the loop and find Trevor again.\n\nI saw this at a film festival with the writer / director present. Besides the obvious Groundhog Day, his inspiration for the story came from 500 Days of Summer, a story of attraction / rejection. Despite Aaron&apos;s various attempts to curry favor with Trevor, the relationship does not seem to develop beyond sex - and the time loop. Aaron has to break out of that particular time loop to finally reach Trevor.\n\nThe principals are hot, and have chemistry, but the psychological wall between them is well-maintained. However, the ending jumps out in a rather sudden manner, which I am not keen on.",

You know, the usual bad acting mostly attributed to very poor directing. To my surprise this was certainly not the case. The plot on the other hand was a lot better than most Horror/Sci-Fi movies. It was simple and somewhat silly, but at least it was not complex and full of a bunch of impossible scenarios. I would recommend this movie for any who likes laid back and not too graphic movies in this genre. Especially on a stay at home date night. Fabian Wolfrom made this film significantly better than it actually is. This is the first time I have ever seen this actor and he has made a lasting impression on me.",

      "reviewBody": "A modern-day spin on one of Shakespeare&apos;s lesser known plays, Coriolanus is an ambitious and lyrical Greek tragedy that has everything you&apos;d expect from the mind of the Bard; betrayal, revenge, pride, conflict, monologues, dilemmas, death- it&apos;s all in there. The only thing missing is a star-crossed lover or two.\n\nBoth its star and director, Ralph Fiennes follows past masters Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh onto the breach in this doomy and demanding directorial debut that may signal a new and exciting direction for the steely-eyed actor. \n\nSet in a city on the verge of collapse that resembles Tripoli but calls itself Rome, the film charts the rise and fall of general Coriolanus (Fiennes); a fiery soldier of war-torn Rome who earns his stripes in a bloody battle against an insurgent army lead by Turrus (Gerard Butler). In the aftermath of a brutal bullet storm and knife fight, Coriolanus emerges victorious and is branded the symbol of a new and prosperous empire. It doesn&apos;t work out. The decorated vet is more brawn than brains; his strong sense of pride coupled with the dirty work of corrupt bureaucrats and advisors lead to civil unrest and, in turn, a verbal attack by Coriolanus&apos; on the people of Rome which results in his banishment from the city. Bitter, betrayed and hell- bent on revenge, the spitting outlaw seeks refuge and redemption in who else but his sworn enemy, Turrus. \n\nSwapping the frantic razzmatazz of Baz Lurhmann&apos;s Romeo and Juliet retool for a far more gritty and paced approach, Fiennes has crafted a brave and bombastic drama that&apos;ll probably find its way onto a school curriculum or two before the year is out. And why not. His contemporary vision of a 300+ year old morality play is one awash with thought, feeling, values, complexities, politics and emotion- pure, unadulterated Shakespeare.\n\nCoriolanus is far from the vision of just one man, though. Gladiator screenwriter Josh Lucas lays the necessary footing for Fiennes and Hurt Locker cinematographer Barry Ackroyd to bring the tale to life. Stirling support also comes in the shape of seasoned thesps Brian cox, Vanessa Redgrave, James Nesbitt and....Gerard Butler; all of which are new to big-screen Shakespeare yet convincing nonetheless. Even Butler.\n\nThe screen belongs to a raw and rampant Ralph Fiennes, though. More than just a noseless sorcerer, Fiennes is an exceptional actor and, now, promising director whose verbose and gung-ho approach from both behind and in front of the lens makes for a fascinating commitment. &quot;Such is the work of a man&quot;. Olivier and Branagh would be proud. Coriolanus will have Shakespeare enthusiasts chomping-at-the-bit, students scrambling for the exits.",

      "reviewBody": "I would advise AGAINST watching this...there&apos;s better things to do with your time and/or money. If, for some reason, you ARE gonna be subjected to this, don&apos;t expect ANY elements of many sci-fi/action films - no realistic martial arts; no gore; no sex, no logic - virtually no attempts to string together something that is a passable movie. So, it&apos;s a no-no, all the way. Rigid acting; illogical continuity (a girl goes off to find a phone box to make an emergency call, telling the guy who see has just seen using his mobile phone), inexplicable jump cuts are common (why did one guy just teleport on to the middle of an ice rink, in another example a girl surrounded by a biker gang suddenly appears on the outside of their ring?). The plot is simple: Copy &apos;The Warriors&apos;, just add a bid of poor martial arts (i.e. four glow sticks are thrashed around in a otherwise black screen to represent a fight, absolute childish crap!) and no one will know the difference, nah! The films title doesn&apos;t seem to make any real sense until after watching this movie you&apos;d wish your mind could be purified of the memory of it! I WILLED it to end... from the 90 mins of the Purifiers, you easily have 30 mins of characters running around the place with annoying bad music, including the director singing with his almost forgotten pop band the Skids. That leaves, say, 60 mins of attempting to clone &apos;The Warriors&apos;, but done so badly your jaw will remain hanging throughout this sorry affair. This is not a movie. This is not an essay about a movie. This does not bear any resemblance with entertainment or cheesy fun or anything connected with the movie business. There are some movies which are so bad you can find them amusing, fun, easy to follow because of their badness... well, fascinating stuff. The only fascinating thing here is the will of the director to show us how badly he can try to rip off a classic which he wrongly believes people have forgotten, total boredom is the honest result. This is probably one of the only movies in all movie history where a blank screen can be a better spectacle...Yes it really is that bad!",

This time our bumbling tax-collector finds himself in prison, fighting stacks of rubber monsters and befriending a Taoist who likes to travel underground! It&apos;s nice to see all the cast back too. This movie is very funny and never takes itself too seriously. For some who didn&apos;t quite understand the first movie, this is great to clear up any confusion. For the others, this is lighthearted entertainment."

      "reviewBody": "My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock&apos;s direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people&apos;s heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",

It was fun to watch, especially the strange robots and their behavior. Of course there were logic-missing moments but it was OK, it didn&apos;t destroy the atmosphere or anything. The higher ranked robots really creeped me out because of their looks. The effects were not that good but enjoyable. The confrontation with the planets intelligence was really funny and me laugh some times. And it&apos;s a movie on a higher intellectual level or it at least tries to be which made it something special, something to appreciate. I already watched some soviet, polish and czech sci-fi movies and I think this one was probably the best, so give it a try.",

Lori &apos;China&apos; O&apos;Brien (Rothrock) plays a cop who also teaches martial arts.  One night, in an attempt to prove to a disbelieving student that martial arts could be applied to the street, she ends up killing a kid to defend a friend.  Overcome with remorse, she resigns from the force and visits her parents.  Unfortunately, instead of getting away from the trouble, it found her... As martial arts fare goes, this is not bad.  You really felt like Rothrock&apos;s performance when she sheds tears at a very nasty incident was quite convincing.  Another thing that works in the film&apos;s favour is the chemistry between Rothrock and co-star Richard Norton (Australian Karate exponent). As you might expect, though, the fights are what this and its sequel are really about, and these are some of the best Western fights ever, I reckon.  None of the slowness of later efforts, and Rothrock&apos;s blows look very powerful (Hong Kong actor/director Sammo Hung says they ARE powerful).  A big hand to Keith Cooke for his lethal boot-work, though. Switch your brain off and enjoy an early slice of real girl power.",

The men will enjoy the beautiful entertainment magazine models. This film includes Penthouse pets Sasha Vinni,Gina Lamarca and Lene Hefner. For women, it has exotic locales and costumes. The first scene opens with Sasha Vinni,covered in blue paint, performing an exotic dance for another woman near a waterfall.In another scene, we have Ms.Vinni prancing around in all her glory with tiger stripes circumferencing her body(Mr.Mond you sure do know how to paint a woman pretty).In the closing scene of the film, we have a gorgeous amazonian She-Devil decked out in red latex-horns and whip included. If you are a single male -watch this film! And if you are not-watch it with your woman. Believe me,this is one film that both men and women will find highly erotic!"

The movie introduces you to voting fraud via a mother and some very dedicated watchdogs. The movie takes you through the personal fight of these people and never ceases to provide the big-picture as well.\n\nCome to the movie with an open-mind and take the ride. The movie does a good job of not coming off as extreme or radical and constantly roots itself in the moment. The people who are fighting for a more open system are very easy to identify with, and overall the movie succeeds in its goals.\n\nHacking Democracy takes an extreme position, but does it with Apple Pie. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "The Great Lie in its own way is quite daring for the time. There were not too many films in which motherhood was seen as a burden rather than a sacred obligation. In that sense Warner Brothers was taking quite a chance with this film.\n\nThe one thing I don&apos;t understand is Bette Davis taking the role of the noble one in the triangle that involves her with George Brent and Mary Astor. Astor&apos;s part is clearly the showier one which she proved by taking home the Best Supporting Actress for 1941. Perhaps it was simply a matter of screen time and that Davis was not going to be in support of anyone.\n\nBe that as it may, The Great Lie involves a possible lie to come when a certain infant comes of age. George Brent&apos;s got both these women on the string. He marries Mary Astor who is a renowned concert pianist in a whirlwind courtship as soon as the ink on her divorce became dry.\n\nTurns out it wasn&apos;t quite that dry yet. But nature taking its course Astor gets pregnant. But before she and we find that out, Brent whose marriage to Astor was technically invalid runs off with Davis who&apos;s a member of the rich Maryland horsey set.\n\nLater on Brent goes missing in a plane crash in the Amazon rain forest and Davis comes up with a marvelous proposition. If Astor will give up the kid when it&apos;s born, she&apos;ll raise it as her own. Astor who is career minded to the last exponential degree agrees to this until Brent finds his way out of the rain forest.\n\nThe Great Lie is one potboiler melodrama which is lifted above its worth by these two women. Davis does what she can with the part, though I think she would have been better as the pianist. But Mary Astor just dominates the film. Her performance is the best thing by far in The Great Lie. This was the pinnacle year in Mary Astor&apos;s career. She also co-starred in 1941 in her best known screen part, that of Brigid O&apos;Shaunessy in The Maltese Falcon. \n\nGiven the mores of the time there are only certain directions this plot can take. The Great Lie would be one great flop, but for Bette and Mary. See it for them.",

Because he doesn&apos;t.\n\nThey come up with this reasoning that they have to do what&apos;s in the photo of the future, else they&apos;ll die or something, which is rather dubious.\n\nBut it doesn&apos;t matter what their reasoning is. These people are experiencing a self consistent time stream. They don&apos;t actually change anything at all. They have no free will. They are automatons. All their thoughts, reasoning, actions are written in stone.\n\n-\n\nI like it a lot and find it repeatedly engrossing. I&apos;ve probably watched it at least ten times and am always sucked right into it.\n\nI think the acting is great, even Ivan, the bookie. He&apos;s pretty funny, and it seems not everybody is sold on him, but he works for me. He DOES come across like he&apos;s acting, but that&apos;s because the character is acting like he thinks a bookie should act.\n\nAnd for a low budget movie, the bulk of which occurs in one apartment, it looks great. I don&apos;t think it ever feels stale due to that, and that&apos;s no small feat.\n\nMy only complaint from that department is when they discover the camera (a nice prop). The three leads look over at it, and it cuts to an insert of the camera, which is obviously an insert since the characters should have been visible.",

Most of the songs are mimed by the kids to adult voices (with the exception of Foster&apos;s My Name is Tallulah&apos;) but the story  a group of gangsters who wipe out rival gangs with splurge guns  is fast-paced and inventive.\n\nThis is certainly one of the best films aimed at children to come out during the 1970s, and has a lot to offer for a general audience, too.  Parker of course would move on to more successful musicals aimed squarely at a mature audience (The Commitments, Evita) as well as a range of other things, but this is a well-filmed and interesting piece of work."

      "reviewBody": "Imagine Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Rear Window, but instead of spying on the people in a building from across a Greenwich Village courtyard and speculating on what their lives are as Jimmy Stewart does, instead you&apos;re up close and personal like you have a dwelling right on the sidewalk and see and hear it all. Instead of a colorful Village apartment it&apos;s a Lower East Side tenement which today would be filled with Yuppies. But back in the Twenties when it was written you have Elmer Rice&apos;s Pulitzer Prize winning Street Scene.\n\nStreet Scene ran a very nice 601 performances on Broadway and two members of the original cast came over for the film. John Qualen and Beulah Bondi playing Mr.&amp;Mrs. Olsen. They reminded me so much of the Kravitzes from Bewitched, Mr. Kravitz who just wanted to relax and read his paper and Mrs. Kravitz forever in everyone else&apos;s business mostly the Stevenses. Bondi was a much nastier character, still kind of funny that her own life is so empty that all she takes pleasure in is dishing the dirt about others.\n\nThe main action centers around Sylvia Sydney who with this film and Dead End established herself as Hollywood&apos;s favorite slum daughter. She&apos;s the pretty girl in the building who gets everyone&apos;s hormones in overdrive. Her lummox of a father David Landau feels trapped by middle age and a life of no special significance. So does her mother Estelle Taylor. Thanks to Bondi everyone knows about her carrying on with the milkman, except her children and husband. When Landau finds out there&apos;s tragedy coming up like an oil gusher.\n\nThe only other significant character is William Collier, Jr. a quiet and studious kid who just wants out of the slum. He&apos;s Jewish and Sylvia is Irish. Despite that Collier is the only one that Sylvia really responds to, even though others push him around and make fun of him.\n\nStreet Scene is not your melting pot slum of the East Side Kids who are from many backgrounds. Elmer Rice has a most politically incorrect work where everyone even casually refers to each other with all the ethnic slurs going. It&apos;s probably why Street Scene is not revived that often.\n\nYet I&apos;m glad the film isn&apos;t lost, it should be preserved and seen as a guide to American attitudes back when it was made.",

      "reviewBody": "Lana Turner, party gal supreme, was a fine actress whose personal life detracted from her fine on-camera work. &quot;The Bad and The Beautiful&quot; &quot;Peyton Place&quot; &quot;Imitation Of Life&quot; and this film &quot;Madame X&quot; are all examples of fine acting. Lana Turner after the Stopanato Murder was given a new lease on her career by Ross Hunter at Universal, and the result was &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; a huge success for Universal and Turner who had an ownership percentage in that hit. Hunter and Turner and Universal reprised in &quot;Portrait In Black&quot; and hit another great home run with a remake of &quot;Madame X&quot; also at Universal. Simply put Lana Turner is outstanding in this film and the last 30 minutes of Madame X has Lana Turner performing as only the best actresses could. Lana Turner should have been nominated, but I gather her party ways, the hangover of the Stompanto murder, etc..left a sour taste with some Academy voters. Fine support by Keir Dullea and terrific seeing Constance Bennett in the role of Lana&apos;s wicked Mother In Law. Ms Bennett died soon after filming. \n\nThis is a fine Film with Lana Turner robbed of a Nomination.",

      "reviewBody": "I have this notion that the thirties was a great pressure cooker for movies, during which time all sorts of experiments were tried. Out of that period came the genres we know today, plus the great invention of Noir, uniquely American.\n\nSo I&apos;ve been watching lots of 30s movies, not because they are good or particularly enjoyable. But because you can see the genotype of today&apos;s movies, which is to say I can see the origins of how we all dream and mostly imagine.\n\nNow here is an anomaly, a 30s movie made in the 40s. I can only imagine that it was to feed the war-starved theaters. It is a remake and &quot;borrows&quot; musical numbers from a couple films that really were made in the 30s.\n\nIt is a spliced picture, three movies combined, something that was common in the 30&apos;s.\n\nOne movie is a stage show. Simple and straightforward. Lots of variety here.\n\nA second movie is a comedic fold: a movie where all the players are involved in some way in a play (different than the earlier mentioned performances and more like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;). Lots of physical humor here. Red Skelton&apos;s technique was to perform a comedic motion (like rolling his eyes after getting bonked) in an exaggerated fashion and then abruptly stop before it finished and look at the audience with a big grin. It was humor about humor, a not very sophisticated but an effective fold that would grow into what we have today (and call irony).\n\nThe third movie has a wartime saboteur. Because the &quot;fold,&quot; the notion of the play within the play, is explicit here, the explosion is to blow up the theater (and somehow simultaneously threaten the nation by mechanisms unexplained).\n\nIts a mess, these three parts not integrated in any way.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

And I fought to keep one eye open so I didn&apos;t fall asleep on it. My dream probably would have been better! Then when I found out what the movie was about I realized I was better off not knowing! I can&apos;t believe someone even put this out on DVD much less a known actress was in it. I guess it&apos;s like my neighbor said, Silverstone hadn&apos;t made a movie in so long that she must have picked something with lines a 6th grader could memorize so she could pay her water bill. Let me tell all of you just how flimsy &amp; pathetic this movie is, it makes that corny Honeymooners &amp; Cat Woman look GOOD! I usually write the names of the new movies down then come here &amp; read everyone&apos;s opinions before renting it. It NEVER fails, when I don&apos;t do that I get a piece of cr-p!

      "reviewBody": "I have long admired the work of Kon Ichikawa, and even got to interview him in New York in the &apos;80s. But his foray into puppet movies with TOPO GIGIO is an embarrassing waste of talent.\n\nThe popular Italian mouse character is a &apos;60s equivalent to more recent critters like the Teletubbies -either you like him and think he&apos;s &apos;cute&apos; or its nausea time. Starring in a feature-length film he wears out his welcome in a hurry.\n\nEver the artist and craftsman, Kon is careful to use interesting lighting and color control in depicting the mouse&apos;s non-adventures. Human beings are stylized by largely being shot so we only see their shoes and pastel-colored socks, with a nearly film noir emphasis on low-key lighting throughout.\n\nThe minimal plot line concerning a bank robbery, James Bond-style bomb and Cold War era missile espionage takes a back seat to supposedly cuddly hamming by the diminutive star. Watching him take a shower or create a new kind of icky &quot;sexiness&quot; wearing supposedly provocative costumes was more than off-putting to me. This is a film that is literally torture to watch -probably might have been a bit hit at the Abu Ghraib cinema.\n\nPerhaps the lowest points come when Gigio feels compelled to sing, and the repeated antics of two little fleas who like to feed on him. Having seen many an Ichikawa film that deals with perversion or obsession (ODD OBSESSION is one of his best works), perhaps the maestro was being intentionally perverse while hiding behind the mask of shooting a children&apos;s movie. \n\nThe final reel of intended pathos, as Gigio&apos;s contribution to saving the world is cruelly ignored by ungrateful humans, was about as bad as cinema can get -underscored by Kon&apos;s mis-applied technical prowess."

This is a fact-based drama that chronicles the exploits of the bank robbing Newton brothers(Matthew McConaughey, Vincent D&apos;Onofrio, Ethan Hawke and Skeet Ulrich)who robbed over eight banks from Texas to Toronto in the 20&apos;s and 30&apos;s. Along with them a friend(Dwight Yoakam)who knew his way with nitro.This makes for exciting explosions on screen with clouds of money to go with gunshot blasts and whining getaway cars. The prolonged career in crime is capped off with a three million dollar mail train heist outside Chicago. This finally landed the boys in a court room and behind bars. By all means don&apos;t walk out on the closing credits for you get to find out what happened to each of the principle players. Also in the cast are: Julianna Margulies, Charles Gunning, Chloe Webb and Casey McAuliffe. There is the claim that the Newton boys never killed a soul during their robbing the bigger thieves...the banks.",

      "reviewBody": "The Great Adventure is certainly not unwatchable, but there was a good amount of talent involved and it should have been much better. The Great Adventure does have enough to make it watchable.\n\nThe scenery and sets are absolutely beautiful, the scenery in the first thirty minutes is enough to take one&apos;s breath away and the film is attractively if simply photographed, the costumes are good too. Also very good was the music, with a stirring score that synchronises with and enhances what&apos;s happening on screen and is the most exciting The Great Adventure ever gets(again the first thirty minutes especially). The nostalgic title song Song of the Wild, beautifully sung by Joseph Allegro, is one so good that it stands as a great song on its own without being part of a film. A few performances are decent too, the best two being Jack Palance and the dog Buck. Palance is methodically intimidating without being over-the-top or phoning-in while Buck is adorable and performs spiritedly. Joan Collins is a touch out of place but plays her tramp with a heart of gold role very charmingly.\n\nHowever the rest of the acting did seem unenthusiastic and going-through-the-motions-like and disadvantaged further by some very obvious, sloppily synced and odd dubbing(Palance and Collins excepted). The Great Adventure is very staidly directed to the point it becomes plodding, while the writing is what really sinks the film. The script ranges between dreary and cornball and never gets better than that, while the very rambling and also rather predictable story is a little pedestrian in pace and has too many disconnected scenes that lead to very little, if there was any tension or emotional connection intended neither of them registered well to me. The dog attacks do lack tension and excitement and the choreography can be silly and awkward, while none of the characters engage. Instead they are colourless cardboard clichés, despite Palance giving the film&apos;s best performance he is also saddled with the most clichéd character, the kind that has been done so many times on film and more interestingly written.\n\nOverall, The Great Adventure is a long way from unwatchable, it looks good, has great music and has a few decent performances but it is let down by the odd dubbing, dreary script, plodding direction and dull story. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "In a post-war Italy, Maddalena Cecconi (Anna Magnani) is a woman from the lower classes abused by her husband Spartaco Cecconi (Gastone Renzelli), who is obsessed to make her young daughter Maria (Tina Apicella) a star in the cinema industry. She expects a better life for Maria, and she sacrifices her marriage and her savings paying interpretation and ballet teachers, dress, hairdresser and bribe for the small time crook Alberto Annovazzi (Walter Chiari) to make her dream come true. When the director sees the test of Maria, Maddalena realizes the reality and cruelty of the entertainment industry.\n\n&quot;Belissima&quot; is a beautiful tale of disillusion. Anna Magnani has a magnificent interpretation in a role of a very poor mother and frustrated woman, spanked by her husband, trying to give a better life for her young daughter. Living nearby a movie theater, she sees the opportunity when a famous director is chasing a young talent for his next movie. Her characters gives the best effort within her short culture and vision trying to make her dream comes true, being very touching the moment when her dreams are shattered. The direction of Luchino Visconti is precise and flawless as usual, and the story is very real and credible. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Belíssima&quot; (&quot;Very Beautiful&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "The stars of &quot;Three the Hard Way&quot; reunite for this enjoyable if not classic Western. Jim Brown plays Pike, a tough, honourable trail boss who gives his word to his dying boss (Dana Andrews) that he will take $86,000 in payroll money to a ranch in Sonora, Mexico. Naturally, when people get wind of this large cash windfall, greed completely takes over, and various groups form to try to get that money. One such interested individual is smooth gambler Tyree (Fred Williamson, in a delicious performance), who is the first to accompany Pike on the journey. Along the way they also hook up with a hard-luck prostitute, Catherine (Catherine Spaak) and her half-breed / martial artist companion Kashtok (Jim Kelly). Among the money hungry antagonists in this story is sly, sleazy bounty hunter Kiefer (Lee Van Cleef), who realizes Pike was at one time a wanted man.\n\nThe cast, under the guidance of Italian director Antonio Margheriti, look like they&apos;re having a fine time, and that feeling is infectious. The reliable Brown has a relaxing low key presence, and he and Williamson continue to have good chemistry. Kelly really is quite good in the role of the mute Kashtok. Van Cleef, who&apos;s given his own harmonica-based &quot;theme&quot;, is fantastic, as could be expected. You&apos;re never quite sure what to expect next from Kiefer. Spaak is touching, Harry Carey Jr., Robert Donner, Charles McGregor, and Leonard Smith offer some amusing comedy relief, and Barry Sullivan is an entertaining villain as crooked lawman Kane. Hal Needham, the films&apos; stunt coordinator and second unit director, appears uncredited as Garmes.\n\nExcellent location shooting in the Canary Islands and a zesty music score by Jerry Goldsmith add to the fun. The action scenes are first rate and exciting, and Brown and Williamson have a pretty intense fight near the end, which is soon followed by a truly impressive set piece.\n\nIn summary, &quot;Take a Hard Ride&quot; is a solid, well done Western that should satisfy fans of the genre.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Hans: &quot;Well, it&apos;s a kind of light, a light, you know, well, a light just as a light is a light, yes, at night when the moon doesn&apos;t shine.&quot;\n\nA soldier called Hans fought in a war and sustained a leg injury. He has been sent away by the king without pay. The blue light is a crystal that (you&apos;ve guessed it correctly ;) shines blue. Will Hans be able to use it to take revenge on the king?\n\nI&apos;ve read two versions of the fairy tale that this movie from the former GDR is based on: the version published in the first edition of &apos;Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales&apos; (1815) and the version from the seventh (the final edition approved by the authors). I liked the first version better. It&apos;s sparser; not every detail is spelled out, so you have to use your own imagination to flesh out the story. Also, it&apos;s a little more brutal. The later version seems to have been bowdlerized a bit. If you&apos;re fluent in German, you might want to try to find it online; both versions are (currently) available at Wikisource. An English translation of &apos;Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales&apos; is (currently) available at Project Gutenberg.\n\nThe movie is a quite free adaptation of the tale. It could have been nearer to the original but at least it&apos;s stated in the main titles that it is a free adaptation. I think it&apos;s good that the filmmakers are honest about that. In the movie, Hans is a young soldier, not an old one like in the tale. It&apos;s not specified in the original story what the blue light is; probably it&apos;s a kind of will-o&apos;-the-wisp. In the movie it&apos;s a crystal. There are some additions to the plot, which are necessary to have enough material for a feature film. Most of these additions are thought out well in my opinion. For example, the passage in the king&apos;s castle is much longer, and they added some little jokes to it that I liked. The final passage, though, could have been closer to the original. I think they wanted it to be less brutal to make it more suitable for young children. But I didn&apos;t mind that very much, seeing that young children are obviously the target audience. The ending has been changed, probably to make the story look less monarchistic. This is probably due to the fact that the movie was made in the (back then) communist part of Germany. But I didn&apos;t mind this change very much, either. To my taste the ending is still good.\n\nAnyway, the core of the tale is there, and that&apos;s what&apos;s most important in my opinion. Hans wants to get revenge because the king has wronged him. The king owes him his pay, and some respect. But Hans must not rely solely on the magic powers of the blue light and he must not exaggerate his revenge. He has to be careful and he has to use his brains if he wants to get what&apos;s due to him.\n\nApart from the plot: I didn&apos;t like the music very much. I think it could have been better. But I liked the sets and the costumes, and the actors did a good job, too.\n\nConclusion: there are fairy tale movies from the former communist bloc that I liked better than this one, especially &apos;Tri orísky pro Popelku&apos; (1973). (I think that it&apos;s more charming and that the music is much better.) And &apos;The Blue Light&apos; could have been closer to the original fairy tale. But I still enjoyed this adaptation. If you like the genre, see for yourself if you enjoy it, too.",

But your mileage may vary, and I&apos;ll let the other reviews cover that. My purpose here is to reveal the horror which I just witnessed on a basic cable showing of Fast Times.\n\nThis movie earned an initial &apos;X&apos; rating from the MPAA when first submitted, and after a few cuts garnered an &apos;R&apos; for its release. The movie I saw on basic cable this morning would barely rate PG. Massive cuts and edits were evident all through the film. Entire scenes were removed. The dialog was edited so that you&apos;d think it was made in the 1950&apos;s. The hilarious masturbation scene was edited in such a way that it appeared Linda walked in on Brad while he was peeing. (They actually ran the film backwards during this scene.) Even some of the musical soundtrack had changed, due to rights issues I&apos;d guess.\n\nMy point is, if you&apos;ve only seen this movie on basic cable, you really haven&apos;t seen this movie. The version I saw today was on A&amp;E, and they just butchered it. Things like that should be illegal.",

One of them (Lotte) lives in The Netherlands, she has a good and rich life. The other (Anna) lives in Nazi-Germany with Germans who do not take good care of her. They want to reach each other but the &apos;parents&apos; make sure that does not happen.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie we switch from 1926 to the present a couple of times. Two old ladies in a Spa meet. The Dutch one is called Lotte and doesn&apos;t want to speak with the German one, Anna. What has happened? The movie shows us what happened. It is a sad story, a beautiful story as well. It could have been a very true story.\n\nThe lead actresses are great. Thekla Reuten and Nadja Uhl make sure that the sisters are lovely characters, you will like both of them and you feel sorry for both of them. They play the sisters when they are around 25 years old. The little girls playing the twins when they are six years old are amazing and lovely too. As the old ladies they are very touching. It is just beautiful.\n\nWith the perfect cast and its nice acting, a fine direction, a great cinematography and a very beautiful score this is one of the best Dutch films I have seen. I loved it and it is definitely worth watching it.",

First the appreciation goes to director Krish. . . And not to forget Ganesh and Santanam with their humors working quite a few wonders. . . . Great work by the entire cast, with STR and Anushka being brilliant along with Prakash Raj. . . Guided by some decent camera works and decent background score. The title song Vaanam and No Money remain chart busters, will keep you happy and contented throughout! A must watch . . .",

I only came across this film because it starred James McAvoy, it sounded interesting so I decided to give it a go.\n\nThe film starts off straight in the action and is one of them films where you are completely hooked from the start to the finish, even though you&apos;re not completely sure what is going on. It got to the point where I didn&apos;t know if certain scenes were the present day or flashbacks, truths or lies, I just didn&apos;t know, but my God it was gripping. There was also some pretty grim scenes in this film.\n\nIn the end it did make more sense but you really have to think about it. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, although I think it may take more than one viewing to really appreciate how good this is.\n\n8/10"

Many years later, when husband Belmondo comes back from America to divorce his wife Jobert, they still act like children, who show their mutual affection by fighting, teasing and slapping each other. The relationship of our protagonists is mirrored by the incestuous and equally ardent love between a nobleman and his sister (played by the beautiful Laura Antonelli).\n\nBelmondo, certainly not a great actor, is perfect in this film, because he plays not a &quot;hero&quot;, but someone who often can&apos;t act but simply has to react, with a blank and uncomprehending face, to the strange events that take place around him (for example, there is one scene in court where he is sentenced to death within minutes). I have seen this film many times and am still amazed by the sheer pace of it. The script is brilliant and one of its most beautiful features is the triptych-like structure (curiously, about at the same time Stanley Kubrick made his own triptych masterpiece &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;): First the prologue, then the first part leading to the centerpiece and climax of the film, then the third part being a mirror image of the first, dissolving with a stylish transition to the short and sweet epilogue, that in itself is a mirror image of the prologue: Although many years have passed, nothing has really changed. &quot;Les Mariés de l&apos;an II&quot; is a poetic film about an endless childhood."

It delves deeply into one of the worst human fears, losing the ability to move and function, but it&apos;s never forced or manipulative, and there&apos;s no heavy-handed message or moral. It&apos;s just a fascinating story that&apos;s beautifully told.\n\nThe acting is as good as you will ever see. Robert DeNiro deftly handles all the emotional and physical challenges of his role, and Robin Williams demonstrates convincingly that he is an actor, not just a comedian. Williams is perhaps a bit too nerdy at first, but he captures perfectly all the hope, fear, exhilaration, and anguish that a doctor in that situation must be experiencing. Awakenings is based on actual people and events, and, to me at least, real events are always more powerful than even the best fiction.\n\nAwakenings had big-name talent and Oscar nominations, but I don&apos;t think it ever had a big box office or became a popular video rental. That&apos;s a shame. I like escapist fare as much as the next guy, but once in a while, everyone should see a movie that you will remember and think about for a very long time. Awakenings deserves to be at the top of your list of movies to see.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s long been considered that Government organizations cover up many incidents. Probably the most infamous are the whispers that The Government actually has proof of alien beings and has their DNA, spacecraft and who knows what else hidden in an area in Roswell, New Mexico called Area 51. Then there are some of the &apos;apparently&apos; factual incidents investigated by TV shows such as &quot;The X Files&quot;. As for the military&apos;s involvement, there&apos;s only speculation - but it&apos;s believed they are present in most of these theories in some respect.\n\nIn &quot;Falcon Down&quot;, it&apos;s the Military and the Government that are responsible for such a large scale cover-up. So large scale, that eye witnesses who have claimed to witness something related to the operation have been erased. Many of these people claimed that it was some kind of Alien spacecraft that was being kept quiet by the Government. In the film, we discover that it&apos;s something a little more close to home. Or Earth if you will.\n\nTwo airforce pilots come face to face with an unforseen terror in the skies. One of them suddenly goes blind and his jet falls to a fiery death. Nearby, a commercial airline also goes down.Wanting answers and bewildered by what has happened, the surviving airforce pilot, Hank Thomas (Dale Midkiff) is discharged from service following a fiery meeting with the rather suspicious, Major Robert Carson (Shatner). Several months later, Hank is bullied into leading a top secret operation, run by his old foe, Carson. The mission involves stealing a super-jet called the &apos;Falcon&apos; (complete with underneath weapon, hence the blinding of the pilot) and then, as he is ordered, take it to a rendevous point where it will be dismantled so no one else can be harmed by it&apos;s terror.\n\nJoined by a group of mercenaries - one a &apos;trigger-happy&apos; Rambo-type, another an intellectual yet green faced player (Judd Nelson), a straight player and femme fatale (Rubin) - Hank skillfully takes control of the stolen jet and finds himself followed by the U.S airforce and other unforseen threats. With fuel running out, it seems the only option Hank has is to land the plane on Ice. And as we know, Ice eventually melts.\n\nLabelled as a B-Grade film, the most surprising thing about &quot;Falcon Down&quot; is that it is notches above it&apos;s direct-to-video companions. The visual effects are well done, the characters are more than the one-dimensional lot we usually see in films like this, and overall, it&apos;s an entertaining ride. Just when it looks to let up, it throws in another surprise, or plot twist. It also provokes a talking point..do top-secret cover-ups like this  happen?"

      "reviewBody": "Mitch Rouse&apos;s &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; was a good discovery. Not having seen it when it was released, we took a chance at it the other night, and it paid off. Mr. Rouse is a man that has worked extensively on television, as well as his co-screen writer, Jay Leggett, who also has a minor role in the film. These men prove they can write and keep their public involved.\n\nThe start of the film shows David and Sara toasting to their happiness, something that will be broken in the course of the movie. On the surface, we are watching David at his bank job. He seems to be successful and going places, until he receives the bad news from the bank&apos;s director that he is being fired because of his poor performance, when all indicates he is a good employee. On top of that, Sara, who is seen with her parents at a dinner in a restaurant, proceeds to tell him she is walking out on him because she has found out he is having an affair with Wendy, another bank employee, and a friend. How much can a guy take?\n\nThe film then changes as David decides to take things into his own hands seeking justice. What we are not prepared for is for the deception on most of the people around, and even David seems to be guided by greed. The surprise ending, in retrospect, seems to make a lot of sense because David is outsmarted by the same ones we didn&apos;t have a clue were involved, at all.\n\nMatt Dillon is a good actor to watch. He carries the film because he is the most interesting character of all the ones we meet in the film. Steve Zahn, as the crazy Jack, does amazing things. Christina Applegate and Andrea Bendewald are also good as the duplicitous women who seem to have figured out their men and what make them tick.\n\nThe film is great fun. Forget the expectations and just have a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Film.\n\nChip &apos;n&apos; Dale begin WORKING FOR PEANUTS as they attempt to steal the little goodies from under the noses of zookeeper Donald and his favorite elephant.\n\nThis would be another typical (albeit enjoyable) Duck versus Chipmunks cartoon, except that this time Donald has a formidable ally in Dolores the elephant. This was the final of three films in which Dolores would appear for Disney; apparently one encounter with the Chipmunks was quite enough. Clarence &quot;Ducky&quot; Nash provides Donald&apos;s unique voice.\n\nWalt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by drawings. As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent Disney &amp; Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt&apos;s older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager &amp; counselor. When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt&apos;s imagination, ensuring Disney&apos;s immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey&apos;s screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt&apos;s growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which Walt&apos;s genius was unbeatable. Mickey&apos;s feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt&apos;s grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a blizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi &amp; Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.",

The idea was to boast of the strenght of the Nazis&apos; party, with images of its members and the German armed forces. Apparently she was not able to do what she wanted, but the result was not that visually execrable. She would have full control of her work for the Nazis, in the subsequent two masterpieces she made.",

Vasily (Vasya) Sitnikov&apos;s paintings and drawings  at least those that survived him, speak less of his asserted insanity and much more of his unique perception of reality and his unfortunate burden  having been born in the USSR. The film about Vasya&apos;s absurd life and his exceptional art, which you&apos;ll most likely never see otherwise,discovers this largely unknown, but MAGICAL painter for those of us who appreciate discoveries at any age in any form.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to start by saying that I am not a huge fan of &quot;chick flicks&quot; but I actually really liked this one! I thought this had a lot of humor and it wasn&apos;t really cheesy humor, it was actually funny.\n\nI saw this at a screening for theater managers and at first I wasn&apos;t even going to go. I wasn&apos;t expecting much from it, it just looked like another rip off of a hundred other romantic comedies. I was very surprised that that I liked it the entire way through and it kept my interest the whole time! Although I enjoyed the movie, it was not an original idea. The one thing I did really enjoy about it was that this wasn&apos;t a sad girl trying to get the guy like many other movies like this are, it was shown through the guy&apos;s perspective which isn&apos;t quite as over done.\n\nI won&apos;t give out any details you don&apos;t already see in the trailer for the movie: Patrick Dempsy&apos;s character is great with women and his best friend is a successful intelligent woman. She goes to Scotland on business and Patrick&apos;s character realizes he has actually fallen in love with her now that shes gone. She comes back and he is ready to profess his love but there&apos;s one problem: she met someone else and is getting married! So now he is her &quot;maid of honor&quot; and has to try and stop the wedding. Like I said, not really an original idea but it is MUCH funnier and more interesting than most of the romantic comedies I have seen. Especially with him being maid of honor, its really hilarious.\n\nIf you are looking for an original movie that hasn&apos;t been done before then this is not for you. But if you enjoy romantic comedies and want a good laugh this one is definitely worth seeing. I watched it in a group of about half and half for men and woman and 90% of the people I talked to enjoyed it. I would see it again and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you don&apos;t like &quot;chick flicks&quot;!",

      "reviewBody": "It starts on April 16, 1961. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a top American spy. When the Bay of Pigs don&apos;t go well, everybody is suspicious of a leak. Then it flashes back to 1939 Yale University. He is a student and recruited by Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro) to spy on a professor with German ties. He is forced into a shotgun wedding with Margaret (Angelina Jolie). The war starts and he goes to Britain working for the fledging American spy agency. He would become one of the best at counter-intelligence but his family life suffers tremendously with his wife and son (Eddie Redmayne).\n\nAs far as I&apos;m concern, director Robert De Niro is 2 for 2 so far. Matt Damon puts in a deadly quiet performance. This is no Bond movie. There are no flashy gadgets and movie contraptions. This feels like the real thing. A spy would obviously not talk about spy stuff. The internalization and the paranoia seems to hit the right notes. The family dysfunction follows logically. I guess people who want the excitement will have trouble with the quietness. I personally found it intriguing.",

Kirk Douglas, icon of tortured machismo, plays Eddie Anderson, son of a tyrannical Greek merchant (Richard Boone) turned Madison Avenue sell-out. He sleeps in childlike separate beds with his wife (Deborah Kerr), who looks and acts more like his mother. He&apos;s obsessed with the one woman (Faye Dunaway) who looks at his barbered, Lavoris&apos;d self and sees the Man He Could&apos;ve Been. The sixties satire of Organization Man is stock, the bombast beats thick and hard, and, as per usual, Kazan can&apos;t resist the Big Moments that are thoroughbred Hollywood hokum. But it&apos;s impossible to deny that this is as anguishedly personal as any of Kazan&apos;s movies--and the machete hacking through the brush that cleared the way for Cassavetes, Scorsese and Ferrara. With its mod, PETULIA-style sets, balletic editing and penchant for stylized tricks, it&apos;s also the most goofily cinematic of Kazan&apos;s pictures--a Sam Fuller whirligig turned into a slick, upscale thirty-second spot."

      "reviewBody": "The average 2.1 rating tells me that most of the people who rated this movie have only seen the Mystery Science Theater version. True, it was a poorly executed low budget 70s horror film but it had a good plot; good enough to be remade as THE ISLAND (2005).\n\nAs a 70s horror flick it is obviously violent and cheesy, but the unique plot, involving a secret clone factory, by itself keeps one&apos;s interest. In better hands it could have been a good movie, and THE ISLAND is, in fact, a good uncredited remake of this one. Consequently, the movie has historical interest, particularly considering that cloning as a reality was still many decades off back then.\n\nThe directing is obviously mediocre. The violence was designed for shock (although it is still tame compared to a Tarantino movie or even a lot of mainstream action or horror flicks of this generation). I cannot openly recommend the movie but do deny that it belongs in the &quot;so bad its good&quot; category. It is, perhaps, more of a guilty pleasure inasmuch as no one wants to admit liking the movie, but I can think of many many movies (including a list of theatrical releases from this year) which are far worse.\n\nIt is not something you can expect to keep in your home video library but it is a unique 70s horror flick that was the &quot;inspiration&quot; for THE ISLAND. It give it 6 out of 10 because of the story and ingenuity, otherwise it would have gotten a 5 at best."

      "reviewBody": "Being an &quot;oriundo&quot;, that is, of Italian ascendance, I was taken as a boy to watch this movie by my parents who were extremely fond of any kind of music -- and of Italian music most of all. I thought that the movie was beautiful but not so interesting, at least for a child of 9 or 10 as I was then. However, I had the good fortune of watching this movie again as a grown-up at a special showing, and what a revelation it was! What seemed only beautiful back then was now not only quite interesting too but, on top of that, also a very delightful way of being introduced to (or renewing your contact with) the endless magic of the world of opera. The movie tells us in rich detail how in 1807, in Milano, Giovanni Ricordi made a deal with the Teatro La Scala to print all the music sheet for them, in exchange for the handwritten works of whichever composer and musician hired by the Theater.\n\n Lovingly directed by Carmine Gallone, who was originally an opera director, the movie shows us how the musical dynasty of the Casa Ricordi Publishers was born, and the amazing quantity of talent this organization worked with: Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, Puccini, and so on. The best moment for me is the staging of the &quot;La Calunnia&quot; aria with the great Tito Gobbi as the playback singer, where Gallone combines both operatic and movie effects to convey the idea that &quot;slandering is a little wind that builds up to a terrible storm to destroy lives and reputations&quot;.\n\nIt is worth mentioning as well that art director Mario Garbuglia and cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno managed to create a real feast for the eyes with their work in this movie. I&apos;ve been trying to get a copy of it to no avail for decades now. When is it going to be released on DVD? It is imperative that it comes with subtitles in Italian so we opera lovers can best appreciate all the flavor of the original lyrics, please. It&apos;s about time someone gives us this neglected gem on DVD..."

      "reviewBody": "I almost considered passing up watching this one, but I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t. This movie has all the hallmarks of a bad afterschool special, actually four or five of them smashed together. But just when you think it&apos;s about to fall off a cliff of cliches, something unexpectedly intelligent happens. Just when it&apos;s about to turn into a tear-jerker, the director puts her camera, almost joyfully, above the rain to show everyone shielding themselves with the church program. Just when you think it&apos;s going to turn into a soppy love story, the characters flee from each other, scared out of their minds at the possibility. Just when you think it&apos;s going to be a soap opera, Mandy Moore acts her way out of the paper bag that people seem to pigeon-hole her into. You get the idea.\n\nThe actors all do well, especially Allison Janney, who puts a real edge to a role that could have easily been mush. I must admit, though, Peter Gallagher, usually a reliable guy, doesn&apos;t do much with his aging hipster role. The real joy here is Moore. She&apos;s got just enough stuff to hook you into the story, and she&apos;s just raw enough that she&apos;ll make you believe. And, yeah, the dialogue is corny here and there, but not outrageously so. I have to hand it to the director to keep everyone loose enough to pull off some of these lines, and to make the shots interesting enough for us to care what happens when they do.\n\nThe plot, which does have its convolutions and weird devices, is not nearly as interesting as Halley&apos;s growth as a character. It&apos;s basically a character piece wrapped in a teen romance. And Moore brings it all together.",

Zaldivar shows his journey from his old homeland to the new through family photographs and home movies. The path to success did not come easy for him and his family, but sometime adapt to the new life in America. Zaldivar traveled ninety miles come to this country, but it seem like world away. A definite film not to be missed."

      "reviewBody": "When someone on a trip starts to wig out, you take them someplace quiet and talk soothingly and assure them that everything&apos;s going to be OK. But as the tagline of this film makes clear, for these characters everything is most definitely NOT going to be OK. \n\nFor those who haven&apos;t read the book, it&apos;s important to know what you&apos;re getting into. PK Dick wrote this novel as a way of telling the story of how he and his friends in the early &apos;70s damaged and destroyed themselves with drugs. He tells this story within the framework of a surreal science fiction thriller, but many of the scenes are straight from his own experiences with the unpleasant consequences of people using drugs and disintegrating mentally. \n\nThis film does an amazing job of capturing the feel and tone of the book as well as the paranoia, perceptual distortions, and chaos of hallucinogenic overindulgence. Add to that a story that only gradually emerges from the madness, but by the end brings in a lot of heavy ideas such as the existence of free will, whether ends justify means, etc. There is a sense of consequence to what happens in the film, a sense of despair at what has been lost. So this story of drug-addled losers becomes the story of the human struggle for identity and meaning. \n\nI have a couple of minor quibbles regarding scenes from the book that only partially made the cut (no explanation for the significance of &quot;If I&apos;d known it was harmless I would have killed it myself, no little kid to explain how 6 and 3 gears means 18 speeds). Still, most adaptations of PK Dick stories take a few basic ideas and try to shape them into more conventional films that fit into established genres. Even when it works, such as with Blade Runner or Total Recall, it&apos;s not really PK Dick. Not so this film. This is PK in all his dark and perverse and deeply thoughtful glory.",

When being a cop does not mean what you though it meant anymore, you might as well quit. Then again, the perception of self justice Wincotts character implies or rather has in mind and seems to have as a philosophy - well let&apos;s just say it is quite something.\n\nThere is a particular initiation scene that is quite well made (Brigitte Nielsen seemed to love it - or was it just acting/her character?). Other than that you get more or less the standard fare you get from most movies from that time. Not much story, but still quite decent overall. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy if you can",

So Shaggy DA has a built-in nostalgia factor as far as I&apos;m concerned, and maybe for others my age, but anyone else would probably be bored to tears. The pie-fight had a little spark of energy, but watching this now mainly just serves to remind what low standards &quot;family entertainment&quot; had in the 70s. It&apos;s really amazing, today, to look back on this kind of stuff-- Shaggy DA, Pete&apos;s Dragon, that &quot;Goin Cocoanuts&quot; thing the Osmonds put out-- and think: Good Lord, was that really the best they could do?"

An experiment with bacteria, algae, electricity and who knows what else, claims the life of the scientist, but then his family begin to notice their home slowly turning into a rain forest. The teenage son plays his role well, embarrassed by his flower child mother, and his stand off-ish father, he just wants to fit in. But despite being the target of his peers&apos; ridicule, he manages to land the affections of one of the prettiest girls in school. If only that skinny dipping scene could&apos;ve happen to me in high school! Anyway, as the house keeps growing, the son slowly develops certain powers that allow him to stand up to his oppressors. \n\nHabitat has a good story, but seems to have run short on special effects funds with 25% of the movie left to film. Some of the interior shots of the growing house are both beautiful and grotesque, but then we end up with strange scenes like a certain explosion at the end, that looks like they rigged a train set model with firecrackers, lightly covered it with moss, and let it blow. \n\nAnother one in the &quot;detach your brain before watching&quot; genre. I like movies like this. There&apos;s so much seriousness in our day to day lives, that when I have the time to watch a movie like Habitat, I like to just sit back, and absorb it. Much like the house did to certain antagonists in this film.",

But at the same time there is the problem of being so liberal in one&apos;s adaptation that every goes sour, the latest attempt at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is a perfect example. But this film, along with Bresson&apos;s &quot;Pickpocket,&quot; should stand as the rules of adaptation for every young director. Both films are very interpretative, but the directors aren&apos;t so naive as to think that mere plot details can constitute a film. So what pushes this film beyond a mere surface-level adaptation? In this case, it takes a deep insight into the nature of Greek tragedy itself. Tragedy&apos;s dualism (the representational and the chaotic) is prevalent in all Pasolini&apos;s works, it was especially essential in his &quot;Gospel,&quot; and I was excited to see how it played out in its own source, and the results are absolutely fantastic. Visually imaginative and so intellectually superior to its contemporaries it seems out of place in film.\n\n5 out of 5 - Essential",

Mahoney is fine though, and the whole result is excellent for me, with splendid locations, animal scenes and a topic which announces nature, preservation of environment. The fight between natives and big, huge Western world companies. John Guillermin was the best Taran directors for me, better maybe than Robert Day and Bruce Humberstone. I won&apos;t compare however with the oldies, from the thirties and forties period. It is then a matter of taste. Directing and acting techniques were not the same...."

Pic was lensed in Brazil in 1985 with &quot;Stranded in the Valley of Dinosaurs&quot; as its working title.\n\nFormat is in the corny vein of &quot;Five Came Back&quot;: a bunch of folks are caught in the jungle and swamp when their light plane crashes en route to Manaos. Among the passengers are an archaeologist (Michael Sopkiw), a scientist who&apos;s killed in the crash, his pretty daughter (Susane Carvall, usually credited as Suzanne Carvalho) plus several other beauties. They&apos;re attacked by indians, fall prey to leeches and quicksand, plus the other tired gimmicks of the genre.\n\nSopkiw finally frees two girls from the clutches of the indians and an hour into the film finds fossilized dinosaur footprints. Just when the film might be getting interesting, the three survivors are captured by a creep using slave labor for his mining operations. The rest of the picture is devoted to the boring subplot of Sopkiw engineering another escape with Carvalho.\n\nThis sexploitationer mixes pratfall comedy, disrobing women and the usual gore carelessly."

(I don&apos;t watch similar films together anyway.) To me, it is much more akin in spirit to &quot;Shirley Valentine.&quot; Woman estranged from her husband in foreign country amidst beautiful scenery, a change of life, etc. For once, a woman having a co-star old enough to be her father actually works with the script! Taylor&apos;s acting here is more subtle than it had been in the previous decade, and it works. I could not relate to a woman who goes to such lengths for her husbands affection, but she is playing a woman of a bygone era, and almost twenty years older than she was at the time (the woman playing her daughter could easily have played her sister in another film). This is a very slowly paced film, but by golly you can&apos;t help but root for Taylor to find some solace, just like Shirley V. All of this leads up to an inevitable confrontation with her husband, and the movie keeps you guessing to the end what will happen between them. Was it worth it? I won&apos;t tell. Knowing what we now know about the kind of father and husband Henry Fonda was in real life can&apos;t help but taint the viewing of him in this role. But hey, they could&apos;ve gotten Bing Crosby. All in all, I saw this movie on video about nine years ago, and as you can see it has stayed with me. So check it out, it beats the heck out of anything on Lifetime.",

      "reviewBody": "Marie Dressler was always never less than watchable and when she was at her best (&apos;Dinner at Eight&apos; being one of the best examples) she was more than great. Wallace Beery was more mixed for me, he had fine performances in the likes of &apos;The Big House&apos; but at other times he could be hammy and unbalance things. Seeing a film with them together did sound interesting, the story sounded charming and the positive critiques promising.\n\nWhile not a perfect film, with a few things that don&apos;t work as well as others, &apos;Min and Bill&apos; was a lovely way to spend just over an hour or so. The good things far outweighing the cons. Whatever reservations one has with the story, the performances of Dressler and Beery make &apos;Min and Bill&apos; well worth watching. As well as the balance of humour and emotion, which is balanced just about right and both elements handled well individually too.\n\nThe story is very slight and very creaky, with some of the pace not always coming to life.\n\nAlso thought that the title does mislead, for a titular character Bill is too much of an underused plot device.\n\nDressler on the other hand is a marvel, never going over the top and the performance is amiable and at times very moving. She also has a very expressive face and telling expressions. Beery&apos;s good natured performance is one of his more subtle and better ones and his chemistry with Dressler is truly charming and gives &apos;Min and Bill&apos; a lot of much needed heart. The production values are not exceptional but it&apos;s still nicely photographed. The direction is sensitive on the most part, if at times a bit on the staid side.\n\nLike what was said above, there is humour and emotion here. Neither over-balances the other, though the latter resonates a little more, and the humour is gently amusing and the emotion genuinely touching.\n\nConcluding, quite lovely if a bit creaky narratively. See for the chemistry of Dressler and Beery and for Beery and especially Dressler (who essentially is the film). 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Being an adaptation of a Japanese comic book, Crows Zero offers some of the most entertaining fight scenes I&apos;ve seen in awhile and the soundtrack is awesome. However, just because this film begs not to be taken seriously, doesn&apos;t mean I can ignore the shortcomings. There is a Yakuza angle that is never really explored or tied in coherently. The number of loose, underdeveloped subplots is astonishing. Last but not least, the English voice-overs are atrocious; I&apos;d much rather just have subtitles. Everythign else sums up a fun time at the movies. You&apos;ll be dropped dead center in one of the toughest schools in the country, Suzuran, which is over run with gangs and violence.\n\nThe film is reason enough for Western fans of the Japanese medium, such as anime, manga, and video games to rejoice and I am pretty sure fans of the comic won&apos;t have reason to complain either. For its male target audience, it is sure to be a hit. Also, if you watch this film and enjoy it there is also a sequel out in the works which I will cover in the coming weeks",

The plot is insane, acting over-the-top, but the historical commentary is amazing.  People actually believed that such a thing as this was possible in the mid-80s, pre-Gorbachev.  This is not &quot;low-level propaganda,&quot; its the most obvious pro-American movie I have EVER seen.\n\nOn the movie alone, the &quot;film&quot; shouldn&apos;t even rate.  But as a Cold-War barometer, every interested person should see this to peer into the height of US-Soviet tensions."

The basic premise is quite simple but obviously there are things I missed not having English subtitles. With that said, it&apos;s pretty simple to see why no company has come to the rescue as there&apos;s really not too much going on. We see the main character in a few different situations and while it&apos;s somewhat clear they&apos;re reworking Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, there&apos;s just very little entertainment here."

We depend on nature and animals to survive. Pollution, eating species into extinction and massacre of environment happens on global scale: sacred and very needed by life on Earth trees are being massacred by human predator. Gold mining, illegal tree cutting, illegal ranching in Amazon already destroyed a lot of sacred trees. Animals&apos; habitat is disappearing with exponential (unbounded) rate. Films: &quot;AMAZON with Bruce Perry&quot;, &quot;The End of the Line (2009)&quot;. Most vicious predator (human) must learn to stop destroying its own environment. (Aside: the human is most vicious predator because it kills for sports.) While most vicious predator propagates with exponential (unbounded) rate, the nature and animals disappear with exponential rate at the hand of most vicious predator. Most vicious predator must stop unbounded (exponential) reproduction: it leaves no space for healthy environment for most vicious predator and leaves no space for animals. CONSUMPTION is not &quot;cool&quot; anymore. Echo-systems sustain the economies. Economies do not sustain the echo-systems. Bottom-lines and corporations only destroy the nature, environment and animals. In the past, we hoped that our technology would help us to live better lives, but as of today, our technology (better traps, binoculars, nets, better sonars to track our prey, better guns, etc) only leads us to the SIXTH EXTINCTION of all life on the planet, at the hand of the human.

      "reviewBody": "A commuter and a farmhand get in one another&apos;s way often, causing tensions and frustrations between them. When the farmhand causes the commuter to miss his train, lose his job and arrive home early to find his wife having an affair, the commuter and the farmhand get into a fight around the farm equipment and end up badly injured  both ending up paralysed from the waist down. Seemingly stuck with one another, they set out on a trip to Finland to seek out the manufacturer of the equipment that put them in this state.\n\nThis sat on my harddrive for several months before I got around to watching it and, if you read the plot summary and know that it is a black &amp; white and in French, you will perhaps understand why. Unsure of what to expect I settled down to it  thinking it unfair that I neglect it in favour of &quot;easier&quot; American blockbusters etc. What I found was an unspectacular but clever look at how disabled people are treated and viewed. The road trip aspect is not much more than a frame to allow this to happen and indeed even the conclusion is making the point in an amusing way. In regards narrative then it doesn&apos;t really satisfy because of this being the weaker aspect but I found the look at disability to be enough to cover this.\n\nThe writer and director do well to avoid sentimentality or preaching and they are very even handed across the telling. We see people being overly kind, people ignoring them, people picking them and so on. Fairly we also seeing them taking advantage of goodwill and being just as big a pair of jerks as able-bodied people can be. It sounds simple to say it but the film does do a good job with this theme and, although not hilarious, it did produce some dark laughs along the way. Writer and director Delépine and de Kervern do a good job in the two lead roles and also work very well with a limited budget.\n\nOverall then not a perfect film but a cleverer one that I initially gave it credit for. The narrative is not a lot more than a frame to allow the dark comic look at the treatment of the two characters but in this regard it works well enough while the examples of treatment are fair and well delivered."

Gory eye candy is on display for much of the running time, and includes some great graphic dismemberment as well as other forms of mutilation. Like another reviewer pointed out, the middle portion of the film goes on too long and could have been shortened to make for a better paced and more enjoyable watch. The whole cult angle is a bit over played but the movie pretty much redeems itself.\n\nBottom line: If you like stuff such as the guinea pig movies or Story of Ricky then this will be an entertaining flick. There is tons of weird imagery, extreme gore, and the monsters are cool to watch. You may have a hard time finding it, but there&apos;s usually one or two available on ebay.",

So she&apos;s goin&apos; back to the convent. She&apos;s gettin&apos; back into that uniform, and, she&apos;s gettin&apos; back in the habit!\n\nWhile there, Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) manages to transform the music class of non-listening, no attention-paying roudy little snots into a magical choir with voices of gold. It is here, that they decide to enter the regional championships for school singing (or something along those lines).\n\nHowever, one girl in particular, once a drop-out, with an awesome voice (played brilliantly by Fugee&apos;s frontwoman Lauryn Hill), is not intially allowed to go. Her mother (played by another R &apos;N&apos; B singer Sheryl Lee Ralph, also from &apos;Moesha&apos;) will not allow her to. So she forges her signature and they head off to the championships.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt stars here, as one of the singing kids from the music class (bearing in mind, that she has since released 3 albums). Wendy Makkena and Kathy Najimy reprise their roles as two of the most-mentioned Nuns.\n\nOnce again, Whoopi manages to pull off another great movie, without a great deal of trouble. Lot&apos;s of fun, but I enjoyed the first one, just a little bit more. 7./10"

Some of the plotting is a bit tenuous but anyone who has spent hours unravelling &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; will recognise Chandler&apos;s style. Great performances all round particularly from William Bendix as the shell-shocked Buzz, watch out for the monkey music. At the climax you will be wondering right to the end who did it. A great and underrated thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "This understated movie is a good example of England&apos;s library of WWII films which refuses to indulge in the campy style that pervades far too many of the American films about that historic and horrible conflict. Hawkins is convincing as the determined captain of Compass Rose, a small sub-hunting escort for convoys moving material from the US to Britain. He is ably supported by his officers, who realistically portray inexperienced civilians pressed into the war effort and turned into sailors. I especially liked the scene where one of them mocks the first mate&apos;s love of sausages: &quot;Snorkers! Good-oh!&quot; When at port and interacting with the civilian population, the low-key realism continues. Nice, believable characters are simply snuffed out by German bombs from direct hits on their homes. The action out on &quot;the cruel sea&quot; is not hyped, but presented as it actually must have occurred, including the killing of unlucky English sailors who simply get in the way and the portrayal of the enemy as human beings fighting for their country, however misguided was its leadership. If you want a lot of explosions and baloney, there are plenty of other WWII films that will fill the bill. If you want a good story about real war, see this one.",

I wonder if the reviewer actually saw the movie.\n\nThe story is about a benaras based family falling into hard times and Rani moving to mumbai to save the family from financial ruin.\n\nA family falling into bad times is certainly not a novel concept. What is refreshing is the story line, which is definitely modern and realistic and never one dimensional. Life in Benaras and Mumbai has been captured beautifully without a trace of cliché.\n\nThe romance between Konkona and Kunaal is refreshing and so is the chemistry between Rani and Abhishek. The story line is sometimes sad but always realistic and upbeat.\n\nActing and Direction is superb. Rani and Konkona are superb. Rani sizzles with her looks and acting. Konkona acting is superb. Kunal has shown he is much more that a pretty face. Abhishek role is short but he does a decent job. Jaya&apos;s acting is flawless.\n\nKudos to the director/producer for choosing a difficult subject and handling it with great sensitivity.",

I rate it 7 out of 10. Hilary Duff is not my favourite actress...yet by far...however, she pulls this one off. Slightly. But I would rather her in this movie than Ms. Wannabe Teen Queen Lindsay Lohan. I mean, come on....you got a boob job honey, we all know. I applaud Hilary for being herself and not feeling pressures to go under the knife. I think that this movie shows girl power to the fullest, and when Hilary&apos;s character &apos;Sam&apos; stands up and tells off her step-mom, it really shows how far confidence can go. Also, when she tells Chad Micheal-Murray&apos;s character where to go, I applauded her. I also think that this quote in the movie, is a great message: NEVER LET THE FEAR OF STRIKING OUT, KEEP YOU FROM PLAYING THE GAME."

      "reviewBody": "If I had watched this film no less than 5 years ago, I&apos;d probably wouldn&apos;t think too much about Michael Haneke&apos;s Palme d&apos;Or winning Amour, which made him one of an elite group of filmmakers who had won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival at least twice (and within a span of three years too). But I suppose having to live through some of life&apos;s experiences, both pleasant and those that are not, would have opened up one&apos;s horizons, connect and identify with the many elements about terminal illness and suffering, love and the quality of life, being affected in more ways that I would have normally allowed.\n\nAs in most of the Austrian filmmaker&apos;s movies, this film centers around the characters of Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva), an elderly couple whom we see are enjoying the twilight of their lives, and their companionship with each other, since daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) is away overseas most of the time. Unfortunately Anne suffers a stroke and more, rendering her paralyzed on one side, gradually relying on the primary care provided by Georges to get through day by day. And given Georges&apos; age, being primary caregiver is also something of a challenge, and a stress both mentally and physically, having made a vow to Anne that he is adamant in keeping, of having no further hospital visits, or to put her in a home.\n\nThe many things that Haneke had put into his film are the hard truths revolving around the dedicated attention given to the patient, from things like feeding and the changing of diapers, doing the household chores which include enlisting the help of others in grocery shopping, to hardware requirements like the commode or the adjustable bed. There may be a certain level of shyness involved during cleaning up, and in every step of the way you want to maintain the dignity of the patient, because the last thing you want to do is to have a drop of morale. The deterioration is painful to witness, as Eva goes from having strength to being completely bedridden, with the ability of communication, a very key thing, taken away when speech impairment rears its ugly head, when therapy can only do so much. Haneke doesn&apos;t gloss over the necessary aspects of suffering, even if under the hands of uncaring home nurses, and probably introduced a little tinge of fear as one grows old, gets sick, and get put under the mercy of others.\n\nGeorges gets the periodic visits from his daughter, but you can almost feel a distant rift between the two each time they try to sit down and communicate. What Haneke&apos;s story and screenplay brilliantly achieved is to be able to say so much without saying much at all, directing the actors to bring out ideas and back-channel communication through their acting craft, making it a very fulfilling experience watching, and dissecting the human relations and condition in each of the characters, even when Eva had to spend most of her time in bed, and portraying the limited range of emotions a stroke patient can muscle together. Perhaps I too felt some guilt each time Eva returns home to check on the latest status of her mom and dad, as it mirrors how I would have loved to be able to do more, if not for modern day commitments, or what we would like to think of as commitments.\n\nBeing a Haneke film, we&apos;d come to know some darker moments to sort of jump through when we least expected, especially so when the title is one as benign as Love in its many forms. While what was shocking wasn&apos;t something narratively new in films done by others, it still made one heck of an impact, lingering for some time which I thought was quite wicked, leaving things rich and open to post-screening debate. Haneke makes you work to come up with your interpretation of events, never telling you verbose details unnecessary to spoonfeed, preferring that you experience and take away something from it, though this was perhaps one of his less obtuse works.\n\nWhat made this film was also the performances of Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, who hardly put in a wrong foot. Trintignant returns to the big screen after an absence of 7 years, with a role specifically written for him, which he duly delivered. His Georges came across as heartbroken and exasperated rolled into one. Emmanuelle Riva may seem to have gotten the easier role having to be in bed, and sometimes absent for the most parts as Georges keeps her Anne locked away, but credit to her fine acting without having the need to over-act or over-compensate for the condition she has to flesh out. The make up department also deserves mention for being able to realistically age her on screen as well.\n\nAmour continues in its winning of the minds of various critics and chalking up awards in the festival circuit, as well as year end accolades. It should be interesting if it does culminate in walking away with the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar statuette next year. Recommended!",

      "name": "Never clear cut in its genre but definitely clear cut in its study, Dead Presidents is an interesting and tragic tale of desperation following Vietnam.",
      "reviewBody": "Dead Presidents hammers home its point in its final scene, a quite brilliant and excruciating in its execution scene in the sense we may want these characters to get away with what they&apos;re doing. The scene is a heist, created between a handful of people who have come to know each other through the years and we have come to understand their predicaments. The finale sums up the sad, sad desperation some of the characters have had to resort to given their life and what has happened to them and captures how hard the times get when they get hard in the first place.\n\nDead Presidents is a crime drama; a social commentary and a war film all wrapped up in one. But this genre hybridity does not work against the film as much as it does compliment the epic feeling that we get when we recognise these characters have covered quite a fair distance. The film is Boyz in the Hood; Taxi Driver; Platoon and finishes it all off with a shoot out alá shortly after the robbery in Michael Mann&apos;s 1995 film &apos;Heat&apos;. The finale stands out due to its jarring slow motion and attention to detail in how they have to go about their plan in brutal, violent, realistic detail  each person is positioned and attacks a victim with a certain weapon in a certain way and focuses on a certain part of the victim. The shootout stands out due to its inclusion in what has been, so far, a film that avoids massive shoot outs and lashings of violence in a steady and careful study of an African-America man in a crisis.\n\nThe study behind Dead Presidents is intriguing and it&apos;s a study of maturity and coming to terms with responsibility. The film has its characters eventually resort to particularly desperate measures in order to merely live but does a good job in not glamorising these means. The primary focus here is the character of Anthony Curtis (Tate), a young African-American in the late sixties hanging around with his other young friends Jose (Rodríguez) and Skip (Tucker) all of whom are about to finish their education and hopefully enter some sort of employment. The setting up of the film is unspectacular but deliberately so; the kids hang out, get high and attend parties. But it is two things that click lead Anthony into his coming of age tale; they are the impregnation of Juanita (Jackson) and the volunteering to go to Vietnam to fight the cause for America in the war.\n\nThese two events will shape the character upon his arrival back to The States and it&apos;s through the pathetic, immature activities that occur at the very beginning that we will get a feel for how far Anthony has come along as a human being when the going really gets tough later on before, as I said, desperation kicks in. These tough times revolve around balancing a family that he has created as well as dealing with his Vietnam experiences in which he witnessed all the atrocities you&apos;d associate with the war.\n\nThe film&apos;s opening third is teasing just as it is entertaining. It threatens to head down a route of crime complete with African-American gangsters hanging out in pool halls, taking rides with one another and getting into scraps; be it with one another over a hustle or Kirby (David), perhaps the fiercest criminal of this opening third, battering someone of a third party nature with his prosthetic leg because they owe him money. But the film never becomes stonewall in its genre and doesn&apos;t resort to clichés. It presents Anthony with a series of choices at a delicate time in his life but they are little choices such as &apos;Does he take the potentially ominous ride with Kirby into the unknown?&apos; as Kirby goes to settle a score and how does he react to first seeing a gun and the potential danger that could spawn.\n\nThese are choices and scenarios that will prepare Anthony for larger, more important decisions. The scenes and scenarios are nothing we haven&apos;t seen before in the respective genre but they&apos;re still required for Anthony&apos;s maturing process. Once in the military, the film again threatens to break into genre and Anthony is faced once again with choices to do with whether he excepts the Euthanasia plea from a dying soldier  guns and death and general darkness remain in his life and are the subject of a lot of his life experiences. But it&apos;s when Anthony returns to New York that a study kicks in. As a character, he has matured through experience and cannot seem to get on with his girlfriend Juanita who&apos;s now a mother after his tours of duty. The film feeds off Vietnam as a war which disables its lone individual from re-fitting into society in the snug, immature manner in which he could prior to the event.\n\nDead Presidents contains a fair number of good scenes and its reference to Taxi Driver as a study of America more observant and concerned with what&apos;s going on in a small, Asian country many miles away when home and its own people are in an equally nasty mess (New York, yet again) is interesting. Anthony&apos;s struggles with employment and family life as well as the pimp that helps out with money and just wants to be friends acts as a highlight that he cannot even get re-acquainted all too easily, no matter how criminally minded the person is and no matter how much they might have had in common had they met prior one of them going off and fighting for one&apos;s country.",

      "name": "East German Musical that is Interesting, but not Satisfying",
      "reviewBody": "I finally decided to watch this movie because I am highly interested in East German cinema (by DEFA). Most of the GDR&apos;s best-known movies are usually set during WWII or its after effects with heavy communist leanings. I have not had time to watch several &quot;Red Westerns&quot; that I own, but dramas such as &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot; and &quot;Naked Among Wolves&quot; were quite masterfully done, so I was eager to watch something different from the good ol&apos; East German studio.\n\n&quot;Hot Summer&quot; just seemed so strange: a teenage musical coming from a Communist country, one not completely known for being &quot;fun&quot; in any way, and I was surprised with this movie. Of what I have read (no, I haven&apos;t seen the documentary noted in other reviews), the lead actors in this movie had made several of these &quot;beach musicals,&quot; all of which were popular, but banned from distribution by the state. I guess the authorities finally decided to produce a musical, and the restrictions are noticeable within the movie (the &quot;law&quot; student needed to remind the other teens about what is illegal, the co-ops reigning supreme, the equality between women and men with NO outward sex or strong forms of affection). \n\nThe movie has to do with a group of boys and girls going to the Baltic for summer break (not quite the Cote d&apos;Azur!). Musical numbers fill and add to the narrative, which includes the story of a boy-crazy girl (Britt) who is being fought over by two of the boys. Other potential relationships are played-down or missing (after all, you need to be controlled, mentally and physically in such a country, so one can only present so much as not to be totally censored for going across the ideologic line).\n\nThe movie is set amongst agricultural cooperative and fishing community, of course. The music is quite good (the album was a huge seller in the GDR). The choreography was also excellent. The problem arises from the disjointed story, which is not quite timed right or told clearly (there is barely any real story). I had to replay several parts to understand what was happening. For example, the movie quickly changes from a song and dance musical about boys versus girls to a heavy drama. The mood changes so quickly, I didn&apos;t have a chance to truly enjoy the preceding number. After the movie ends, I realized that I wanted more, but, alas, I am watching it through Western eyes, and I have to remind myself it was made in East Germany.\n\nOverall, the movie is more of a novelty, one from the era of a heavy handed government who attempted to make a movie that was far from reality, but maintaining ideological standards. After all, the GDR was not a wonderful utopia. Movies needed to conform to ideology, and individual auteur identity is greatly squelched here. The actors and actresses are quite attractive, but the audience needed those types (much like the USSR needed socialist realist figures), in order to show that &quot;we aren&apos;t all that bad!&quot; Historically, it is a fascinating movie! \n\nTo me, the best number is the song that really puts down Britt, after she is found to be playing the boys for suckers all along.\n\nOne mention: It is unfair to compare this movie to &quot;Grease,&quot; and the Avalon/Funicello movies were way to comical and slapstick. This is a different movie, that owes a lot to those types of movies, though. Don&apos;t be suckered by the cover.\n\nNot a horrible movie, by far, but not one of the greats from the GDR. The problems are mainly because of censorship and agenda, which restricted personal input and freedom of expression. It is for students of cinema and, perhaps, theatre people looking for ideas through the movie&apos;s great music and dance numbers, but not for this casual viewer. The casual viewer would probably want their life back.\n\n6 of 10 for story; 9 of 10 for music and choreography.--------- E.",

      "reviewBody": "Spielberg remains to this day one of the most misunderstood film-makers of his generation. He has been labeled both a peddler of popcorn and a saccharine manipulator (Those who say the latter have clearly forgotten Alex Kitner erupting in a geyser of blood in Jaws, exploding Nazi heads, the horrors of the Holocaust in Schindler and the river of corpses in War of the Worlds). \n\nThere are two Spielbergs.  There&apos;s the man who makes somber, academy award winning dramas (Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, War Horse, Lincoln etc). Then&apos;s there&apos;s the 10 year old playing in the sand box (The Indy films, Hook, Jurassic Park, Tintin etc). What I enjoy most about the &apos;Berg, is how he can zigzag between disparate genres.  But after a stretch of SF films (A.I, Minority Report and War of the Worlds), I was looking forward to a return to the free wheeling fun with Crystal Skull. It turned out to be an uncharacteristic dud that despite the boffo box office, proved to be deeply unpopular with fans of the series.\n\nThis made me cautious about Ready Player One. Had Spielberg lost his touch?  I was wrong. This may be one of the most visually amazing and effortlessly fun films I&apos;ve seen in a long time. I have not read Ernest Cline&apos;s novel, so fans of the popular novel may have issues, but I rarely read the books before seeing the film. \n\nThe cast are great. Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles. Alan Silvestri&apos;s robust score is one of his most memorable. I miss John Williams, but it&apos;s still a great score. Longtime &apos;Berg collaborator Janusz Kaminski&apos;s cinematography is beautiful. And it&apos;s the only film where you&apos;ll see a DeLorean chasing a T-Rex on the big screen. That image alone is worth the ticket price.    He never went away, but it&apos;s nice to see him back playing in the sand box.",

The film is designed around Barcelona&apos;a Catalan identity, and how Cruffy has uplifted the entire Catalan community&apos;s morale and self esteem during his years as a player and a coach. The film starts with Catalan related motives, and continues with Cruffy&apos;s football and personal qualities. I especially liked the fans&apos; imitation of Cruffy&apos;s well-known figures and moves. I guess this is one of the best documentaries for a sports person. When I was young, I didn&apos;t like Cruyff, but after watching the film, my opinions has changed drastically. I truly recommend it to all documentary and Cruffy fans."

Peacefull demonstrations in Leipzig were still against the law and east Germans secret police were throwing people into jail for standing up against the authorities.\n\nSo someone must have seriously pushed this comedy to the movie theater without authority approval. Which makes this screen gem such a rare thing.\n\nThe jokes in this movie are extremely witty. Some need to be thought over more than once or someone with east German decent need to explained. However I&apos;m still surprised how many of the jokes still hit their mark today (e.g. about university administrations).",

So I was pleasantly surprised watching this touching and realistic drama about recent Balkan war. Well, it can be any of modern war - war it&apos;s a horrible thing wherever it happens.\n\nI don&apos;t like tell many words about the plot but because this film isn&apos;t famous it worth several lines. It&apos;s a 1995, in former Yugoslavia, at the height of the war. Bob Hoskins (only one Anon-Polish actor in the movie) played Sharkey, who wants for some reason get a kid (perfectly played by young polish talent Sergiusz Zymelka) out of a war torn country. Everywhere is anarchy, brigandage and marauding. Man&apos;s life worth simply nothing. For young orphan Vlado Sharkey it&apos;s the only chance for escaping from this nightmare. But for this they must travel hundreds miles through many obstacles. At the time of this journey we learn more about two main characters. All scenes through the agonizing country were perfectly shot and looked incredibly powerful and realistic. Also I found story didn&apos;t so forced like in some others modern war films (though it also wasn&apos;t flawless here). Cinematography was almost perfect, also worth to mention the very good soundtrack.\n\nOverall, I found Where Eskimos Live very good for such small-budgeted production. So, if you get a chance I recommend to all people check it out.\n\nMy grade 8,6 or A-. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.",

The boy who plays the main &quot;hero&quot; is such a geeky wimp, it&apos;s an insult that this dweeb would have this power to stop the mighty Warlock!!! Like i said before, this film is a one man show, the scenes with Julian Sands are funny, entertaining and the way he kills off various people with lots of clever special effects makes it great fun to watch.\n\nBut overall i give this movie 5/10, coz all the other scenes were so dull.",

There are no memorable artful shots.\n\nWhat makes this movie worth watching is the storytelling. You know what is going on out of context, but don&apos;t know why it is going on (the context), especially early on. Contextual details fill in that keep you interested while leaving more mystery to be unraveled. By the end, including the coda, you can put all the pieces together to create a coherent comprehension of what you watched.\n\nThe movie moves at a good pace, neither rushed nor lingering.\n\nThe movie is not so compelling that you&apos;ll want to watch it twice. There are no revelations in the film later that add deeper meaning to earlier scenes.\n\nThis movie is enjoyable enough if you like mysteries and sci-fi themes. This is definitely not a movie for those with short attention spans or low intelligence.",

      "reviewBody": "In a year that produced enduring classics like &quot;King Kong,Dinner at Eight,Queen Christina and 42nd Street&quot;,just to mention a few examples of this amazing crop of films,&quot;Cavalcade&quot; managed to be awarded with the Oscar for best picture.This dated and quite boring movie didn&apos;t deserve such an honor.Based on the play by Noel Coward about two British families (one aristocratic and one of working-class stock)the movie traces their lives through the three first decades of the 20th century.With the possibilities that the story gave of making a grand epic saga,the film makers opted for more or less to reproduce the play as filmed theater only with montages of those world shattering events of the early 20th century.This almost killed the movie for me.The acting is not especially noteworthy except for the performance of Herbert Mundin.The movie is quite interesting in it&apos;s depiction of the old Edwardian society trying to adjust to the upheavals of the times and not quite managing it. Although I found it hard to sit through the movie isn&apos;t quite a waste of time because of its historical significance.",

It&apos;s about life....about the continuity of life... about moving on... about taking stock of who you are, and who you are going to be. Billy Chapel stands there, quietly, introspectively, doing what he has always done, what he wants to always do, but knowing at the same time, through his reflections and his actions, that things change nevertheless. At the crux of the pennant game for the Yankees, this Detroit pitcher stands on the pitcher&apos;s mound, knowing, seeing, the flow of life. His team sold, knowing his days for the Tigers are over, that his catcher will likely not be there again, that his great love is leaving, that her daughter has grown, his friend playing now for the Yankees, even the last pitcher he faces - who began as a Tiger bat boy for the team his father played for, the Tigers - a boy whom the announcers say has no idea of what this moment is, although he does, his team owner watching the last great game of summer... deciding... about the rest of his life. Through his comments, his thoughts, and his reflections, he evaluates not only where he is going, but who he is and what he will be. And at the precipice of the rest of his life, a perfect game in the balance, he finds it... what his life means. This film never fails to make me cry.",

      "reviewBody": "In Jafar Panahi&apos;s claustral feature debut, the brilliant central conceit is that being a woman in Iran is exactly equivalent to being the Wrong Man in an Alfred Hitchcock movie. In the movie&apos;s nameless Iranian city, the narrative baton is handed off from one woman to another, each of them missing an ID card, a chaperoning male, some form of social validation; without it, the long arm of the law winds around each woman like a python. Panahi&apos;s style--long, fluid takes that are at once bruisingly verite and dreamlike--buckles in the script&apos;s ingenious (and perhaps unconscious) major device: in this movie, women are a secret underworld with nodding, unspoken signals, just like hoodlums silently acknowledging one another in a gangster picture. There is no warm-hug sisterhood here, just the desperate mutual regard of the about-to-be-caught.\n\nThe honesty and unfussiness of the style of contemporary Iranian directors enables them to get away with stuff other artists might not, such as the ending of this movie, which, in a European or American movie, might seem thuddingly unsubtle. Here, it seems like the fulfillment of a nightmare--and it works because of Panahi&apos;s wittily blunt style, which is pitched somewhere between Iranian neorealism and Elaine May&apos;s MIKEY AND NICKY. And it works because of our constant recognition of the literal, physical courage of the movie: our glimpses of current state attitudes toward abortion, prostitution and corrupt police are so bald one marvels at Panahi&apos;s (and the cast and crew&apos;s) effrontery. Never has chador seemed less exotic and more evil--a manifestation of a terror of the beauty and pleasure of the female body that seems to engulf each character like a Cronenbergian plague. (The movie&apos;s wittiest touch is Cronenbergian, too: a woman character has a tic that gives her away to the cops--pregnancy-induced vomiting.)"

      "reviewBody": "DREAMLAND is one of those little Indie films that sneaks up on you, draws you in and leaves you feeling fulfilled. Written by Tom Willett and directed with great sensitivity to both style and message by Jason Matzner, the film boasts a truly remarkable cast in every role and the ensemble acting is some of the finest in this year&apos;s lineup.\n\n&quot;Dreamland&quot; is the name of a very small trailer park in New Mexico, out in the sticks, yes, but surrounded by the magnificence of majestic clouds in crystalline blue skies and a land free of industrial detritus - except for the powerlines that play such an important role in the story. In a sad trailer house live Audrey (Agnes Bruckner), a poet who has given up chances for college to remain with her father Henry (John Corbett), a man decimated by the death of his wife to the point that he is unable to leave the trailer even to buy the beer and cigarettes that sustain his life. Audrey also is caring for her closest friend Calista (Kelli Garner), a beautiful girl who dreams of becoming Miss America but knows her life is to be shortened by the fact that she suffers from Multiple Sclerosis. Audrey writes her poetry but her life is consumed by being the caretaker for Henry and Calista.\n\nInto the trailer park moves a new &apos;family&apos; - hunky young Mookie (Justin Long) and his mother ex-singer/performer Mary (Gina Gershon) and her live-in boyfriend Herb (Chris Mulkey). Audrey and Calista watch them unpack and while both girls find Mookie attractive, Audrey talks Calista into dating him. Audrey&apos;s only male contact is her &apos;sex-buddy&apos;, tacky and gawky Abraham (Brian Klugman) who works at the local convenience store with Audrey. Mookie and Calista begin an affair while Audrey looks on longingly, and when Calista lets Mookie know she has MS the relationship is strained: Mookie also is leaving for the university soon.\n\nAudrey confesses her feelings for Mookie and Calista flees on a motorcycle to chase the now departed Mookie. She is in an accident and is hospitalized and since she has broken her relationship with her caretaker Audrey, Henry manages to draw enough courage to leave his trailer to sit at Calista&apos;s hospital bedside - along with visits from Mookie. Calista&apos;s accident makes her even more aware of her fractured future and she releases her feelings for Mookie, reconnects with Audrey, and Audrey&apos;s father discovers her many letters of acceptance to college she has hidden to prevent abandoning her role as caretaker and convinces Audrey to flow with her dreams instead of being imprisoned in Dreamland. And the manner in which each of the characters in the film resolves the changes now facing them is the tender ending of the story.\n\nDREAMLAND is created by a very strong cast of fine actors who dwell solidly within their characters&apos; psyches, making this somewhat surreal story very real indeed. The setting is extraordinary in its ordinariness and the camera-work by Jonathan Sela is impeccable. This is a strong story about coming of age, about quality of love, and about being human. It is a treasure. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "I bought La Visita having watched Adua e le Compagne and then wondered what else Pietrangeli had directed that I could get hold of with English subtitles. La Visita is at least as good as Adua and features another great performance from Sandra Milo. She is a thirty-something small town woman called Pina who decides that the time has come to get married and so places an advert in the paper in the hope of finding a suitable man. After some correspondence with Adolfo she invites him to come to her home for the day so that they can get to know each other and it is this day, along with a few flashbacks, that provides the whole of the movie. We are introduced to Pina as she prepares to meet Adolfo at the railway station – heavily made up, sashaying around in a white suit and adjusting the poster of the Tower Of Pisa in the waiting room so it doesn&apos;t lean. Pietrangeli sets up a caricature of a slightly dim and frivolous woman then spends the rest of the film subtly undermining it as we come to realise that Pina is shrewder, more capable and yet more vulnerable than at first glance. Sandro Milo is an intelligent comic actress and gives her character a great deal of warmth and humanity so that we root for her all the way. She makes us will Adolfo to be the man she wants him to be and then, when he clearly falls short, makes us desperately hope that she will see through him. After a day of incident where the two get to know each other and Adolfo meets all the friends and neighbours in Pina&apos;s life, the film culminates with great sympathy and insight in a way which is just about perfect. This is a very funny and ultimately moving film which deserves to be seem by a much wider audience.",

      "reviewBody": "I spent several winters snow camping, going into California&apos;s Sierra Nevada on skis, and adored it, but I&apos;m afraid of heights and never gave climbing the briefest consideration. The lure was impossible to grasp. (Women climb a different life-and-death peek in childbirth.) But I love survival stories, and this went further to explain risk-taking than anything I&apos;ve encountered. Simpson&apos;s honesty about fear makes it a spellbinding spiritual epic. He attempts the same route that his inspiration as a lad had failed to complete, and in his narration uses language with the same care as his climbing gear. I get it now. Or maybe I don&apos;t - but listening tuo a man who uses English with such power is not a voice I&apos;ll soon forget. It&apos;s a love story between man and mountain, the bond forged among climbing partners, conquering fear yet knowing when to stop; the awe of death and the horror of loneliness.... I&apos;m so glad he followed his considerable wisdom to find a route off his inner mountain into another rewarding career, He&apos;s at the top of his game - as a writer this time, expressing his experiences of loss and grief and passion for life without a drop of sentimentality. It&apos;s poetic exactness with Shakespearean depth.\n\n(N.B. Improvement in the directing could (will?) make it one of the great documentaries. I wasn&apos;t sure at times which team we were following (a helicopter in the 1930&apos;s?).and something as simple as a notice saying &quot;50 years later&quot; would have helped. Or I was just being a moron! :o)",

Partly because of being so busy, but also, although being an admirer of a lot of the cast and crew, finding that the subject matter didn&apos;t appeal to me for a while.\n\nGoodness knows why though, because finally getting round to it &apos;The Song of Bernadette&apos; was a miracle of a film. Sure it is a long film, perhaps a little too long (the only thing that counts as a debit against it for me, and it is so small because what it does right is enough to fill a novel), but contrary to one might think its point of view that it portrays is valid and very sincerely put across, not heavy-handedly or in a way that&apos;s biased. It also, from personal view, doesn&apos;t contrive to move audiences, or convert viewers and sceptics to its way of thinking. The emotional impact comes from how well it explores its subject matter and how much the sincerity and poignancy shines through every frame and performance.\n\nBefore one forgets, &apos;The Song of Bernadette&apos; is a surprisingly quite faithful account of the story of Bernadette Soubirous, which is an amazing story in itself, some may ask how idealised it is, actually considering other films based on true stories/history etc and the subject matter it doesn&apos;t actually feel that idealistic. It manages to do the seemingly impossible in making capture the main events, spirit, background and atmosphere of Werfel&apos;s novel and making everything cohesive while condensing things necessarily to the point from a book so rich in detail to the point of bloat.\n\nThere are so many that make &apos;The Song of Bernadette&apos; a film miracle. The luminous black and white photography wholly deserved its Oscar, that, the atmospheric lighting and sumptuous production values help make &apos;The Song of Bernadette&apos; one of that year&apos;s (that half of the decade even too) most visually beautiful films. Alfred Newman&apos;s score adds so much to the film to the extent that the film may have been a completely different one without it, and it&apos;s hardly surprising it&apos;s garnered a soundtrack album of its own considering how well it stands up as music on its own. It&apos;s stirring and achingly gorgeous music, some of my favourite work of his.\n\nScripting doesn&apos;t resort to preachy sermonising or bias, instead it&apos;s very intelligently written and as aforementioned the argument it makes is valid and sincere, and it makes sense. The dialogue itself does provoke thought some time after. The story is incredibly moving and inspiring, also being careful not to paint its characters too black and white. Despite being a long film, the production values, music and performances are so wonderful, Henry King&apos;s direction so sensitive and the emotions so high that one is riveted throughout.\n\nJennifer Jones, in her debut performance (in her own name that is, having done a few other previous projects under a different name), seldom gave a more touching or better performance, of her five Oscar nominations this was the only time she won one and it was a very deserved win from personal view.\n\nIn support she is particularly well aided by Gladys Cooper, on fiery form, Vincent Price, impeccably giving his character menacing colour and unusual restraint, and Charles Bickford, suitably sympathetic. The Virgin is sincerely portrayed as a symbol of hope by Linda Darnell, am also of the opinion that the film and role were not trying to say anything comparing who was greater between Mary and Jesus, it was just a symbol.\n\nOverall, a miracle of a film. Whether one is converted is very dependent on the person, personally I watched &apos;The Song of Bernadette&apos; expecting to be challenged but still admire it a good deal, finished it feeling very moved and inspired. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Arena taps into a time when fighting films had peaked and Rocky was deep rooted in the conciseness along with WWF specials. Director Peter Manoogian offers plenty of showdowns. His direction is fine and many of the makeup and special effects still hold up. \n\nIn a cast of outlandish aliens Claudia Christian features as Quinn and the Christopher Reeve-a-like Paul Satterfield&apos;s Steve Armstrong works as the stereotype hero.\n\nDespite its clichés and the fact it was never going to win any Oscars its many references to other science fictions and fresh concept makes it an enjoyable low budget science fiction."

But if you want to recognize how the urban Argentine culture in the 60&apos;s was deeply interwoven with the world culture movement of that decade, do not hesitate and see Los jóvenes viejos (The old young men).\n\nAnd it is so because two main reasons. Firstly, because during the 60&apos;s, the until then remarkable Argentine cinema developed as an important movement, to which appertained directors such Rodolfo Kuhn, Manuel Antín, Fernando Ayala, and Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, among others, a movement analogous to the French Nouvelle Vague. Secondly, because many films of that period connect to and, almost to some extent, reflect the quickly changing culture scene of the time.

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t profess to know anything more about &apos;the McCarthy era&apos; than any other non-American that wasn&apos;t around in the fifties, but this film serves as both a great slice of entertainment; and something of a history lesson. The film is said to be a comedy, although it would seem to be played out more for the drama side as aside from Woody Allen&apos;s usual neurotic quips; there aren&apos;t actually any jokes in the film. That certainly doesn&apos;t harm it, however, as Martin Ritt&apos;s film has more than enough in reserve, as the story is interesting enough on it&apos;s own; and themes of &apos;the witch-hunt&apos;, as well as the idea of being guilty until proved innocent shine through. The story follows Howard Prince (Woody Allen) a cashier who, when asked by his friend who is on the &apos;blacklist&apos;, poses as a TV writer so the blacklisted writer can still work. The film takes place in the time when paranoia over communism was rife in America, and anyone that is suspected of associating with communists was no longer allowed to work. The scam goes on, but the more Prince is dragged into it, the harder it is for him to get out.\n\nLike I say, I didn&apos;t know much about the era before going into the film; but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s an important part of American history; if only for the fact that it&apos;s inspired a lot of great films, including the great original version of &apos;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&apos;. I&apos;ve been a big fan of Woody Allen ever since I first saw one of his films, and his performance here takes in all the best elements of his persona. The character; a talentless man garnering praise for someone else&apos;s work, suits Allen&apos;s personality like a glove, as the paranoid actor gets to show us how neurotic he can be. Support comes by way of the likes of Zero Mostel, Michael Murphy and Andrea Marcovicci; and all give nice supporting performances. Director Michael Ritt ensures that the themes of the story are always rife, as the film presents a great sense of foreboding, and scenes such as the one that see an innocent writer told that he can&apos;t be got off the hook because he hasn&apos;t done anything help to ensure this. On the whole, The Front is a great classic film, and sees Allen in one of his best roles.",

I have seen comments saying shorter would have been better but I disagree. The current length provides the time to wallow or sit in the pain being felt rather than skipping over it to make it more palatable.\n\nThe ending is almost irrelevant, it could have ended in a multitude of ways and really isn&apos;t important.\n\nIts a tough film but also incredible.",

But although the film&apos;s plot doesn&apos;t earn many points for originality, being heavily reminiscent of the French thriller Les Diaboliques, director Jimmy Sangster delivers enough startling imagery (Cushing&apos;s shattered glasses; a gloved prosthetic arm) and well-handled scenes of suspense to ensure that the film is certainly never dull: from its wonderful opening credits sequence, in which the camera pans across the school to eventually reveal the legs of a man hanging from a tree, to its tense denouement, Fear in the Night is a solid slice of macabre entertainment.",

Having seen other reviews I kept my hopes low but hoped that there may be some redemption in the form of sex, blood and cheesiness. Sadly this wasn&apos;t the case. Our female musicians all look like models, but the characters are very annoying and get to keep their clothes on. Horror legend Donald Pleasence has a small part yet in the English language version he has been dubbed - BADLY! It sounds like somebody trying but failing miserably to do a Pleasence impersonation. As a fan of his I found this to be an abomination and unforgivable.The film is has 1980&apos;s cheese but not in a good way. The gore is pretty minimal, some sets are strangely draped in curtains (I think they were trying to mimic the look of Suspiria) and as already mentioned zero nudity. One of the few good points is Italian Scream Queen Daria Nicoldi among the female cast. Italian horror movies had nosedived by the late 1980&apos;s, this being a prime example",

      "reviewBody": "Some scenes in this film drag on too long and others are too wordy, but I thoroughly enjoyed Charles Boyer&apos;s performance as Napoleon Bonaparte. His slight accent accentuates believability. The same can be said about Greta Garbo&apos;s slight accent, but she is so stunningly beautiful I hardly noticed. She is also excellent in her last dramatic performance. There are two great scenes to watch for: the opening attack of the cossacks, riding their horses inside the stately home of Garbo and Henry Stephenson and wrecking it; and the ball at the palace in Warsaw, filled with noblemen and noblewomen adorned in gorgeous period clothing. (The gowns were designed by Adrian). Both crowd scenes are handled very well by director Clarence Brown. I was a little disappointed in the limited screenplay. Somehow, when I think of Napoleon I think of a grand epic such as &quot;War and Peace,&quot; and not just his personal life. The only part of his war life you see is a brief scene of his retreat from Moscow in the harsh Russian winter. I was impressed by Napoleon&apos;s vision of a United States of Europe. He would have been delighted at the introduction of the Eurodollar this year.",

Now the so called boring christmas movies all look like award winning movies after watching this garbage. It&apos;s not even a good slasher for people who like that genre. The acting is below average if not to say sometimes very bad. The story, I didn&apos;t expect much of it honestly being it a slasher, is even worse than I thought it would be. The story-line is so boring and badly written it makes you cringe. There is only one advice that I can give you and that is avoid at all cost!",

      "reviewBody": "BLADES OF GLORY seems like a natural follow-up to Will Farrell&apos;s TALLADEGA NIGHTS, as its spirit and silliness are sure reminiscent of this wonderful comedy. However, here the setting is ice skating and Jon Heder (&quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;) is also the co-star.\n\nThe film begins with Heder and Farrell tying for the gold medal in the world championship that is obviously supposed to be the Olympics. However, the Olympics are an extremely litigious organization and would have sued the studio for every penny they could get, so the Olympic trademark rings were changed and the word &quot;Olympics&quot; never were uttered in the film. Despite both men winning the men&apos;s individual gold, however, they were bitter rivals and began a hilarious fight on the podium--with horribly unexpected results. In retaliation, the men are stripped of their medals and banned from Men&apos;s Figure Skating. However, later they learn that this did NOT mean that they could not compete in pairs and they men create the most unusual skating team in history!! Now before you read on, it&apos;s very, very important that if you see the film you are the type person who can suspend disbelief. Sure, the moves they make aren&apos;t legal, two guys are NOT allowed to skate in pairs skating and the film is chock-full of impossibilities....and don&apos;t even get me started on the ending!! The bottom line is that if you are a nit-picking twit, you&apos;ll drive yourself crazy making sense of the impossibilities in the movie. My advice is to resist this urge strongly and just sit back and enjoy. The film is hilarious and it&apos;s amazing to see Farrell and Heder skate as well as they did (though it&apos;s obvious that some CGI was used--believe me, NO ONE could do much of what was done in the film!).\n\nOriginal and exceptionally silly and stupid, this is a great &quot;turn off your brain and enjoy&quot; sort of film (much like TALLADEGA NIGHTS). While I often like very cerebral films and art films, sometimes I just need a liberal does of stupid and fun and this film fits the bill very nicely.",

Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by William H. Daniels.\n\nOffshore oil drillers set up base at Port Felicity, Louisiana and find the town&apos;s shrimpers are not at all happy about this threat to their livelihood. Conflict and affairs of the heart do follow.\n\nOne of the eight films that James Stewart and Anthony Mann made together, Thunder Bay was relevant in topicality upon its release, and remains so today. Whilst lacking the psychological smarts that the duo&apos;s Western productions had, it&apos;s a handsome production with the expected qualities in front of and behind the cameras. There&apos;s a lot of talky passages, which given the subject matter pulsing away at the core is understandable, but Mann ensures that action and suspense is never far away. It all builds to a crescendo, with loose ends and quibbles conveniently tied up in a Hollywood bow, but such is the skills of actors and director it rounds out as good and thorough entertainment. 7/10",

This isn&apos;t a movie about Larry Flynt, the porn king. It&apos;s more a movie about the right to say what you want to say, without having to think of every person&apos;s opinion first. \n\nYou may not like the man or what he stands for, but at least he has the guts to stand up for what he believes in. He defends his right to speak freely and doesn&apos;t mind kicking against the shins of the ultra conservative Christians. In a way today&apos;s America needs more people like him instead of acting like a bunch of sheep being brought to the slaughterhouse by their government...\n\nThe acting in the movie is very good, but especially Woody Harrelson as Larry Flynt and Edward Norton as his lawyer were excellent. Courtney Love isn&apos;t really an actress, but still did a good job (not that hard to do when you play a role that you are quite familiar with in your own life.)\n\nAll in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will be loved by some and hated by many. Personally I liked it and I give it a 7.5/10",

Ryunosuke broods on this, while Koichi seems more at ease with the arrangements. Together, the brothers hatch a plan to meet at the point where the new shinkansen trains pass each other, after hearing an urban legend that the vortex created by the speed of the trains has the power to grant wishes. Meanwhile, granddad tries out a new sponge cake recipe, a friend of Koichi&apos;s has acting ambitions, and Dad is writing a new song.\n\nThe usual Kore-eda themes of fractured families and kids finding magic in a flawed universe are present, but by the director&apos;s own standards this is a much lighter, almost sugar-coated engagement with those themes. There is the signature naturalistic, engrossing performances from the child actors, with Ohshirô as Ryunosuke especially impressive in his conflicted, caring attempts to be re-united with his brother. Koki is more of a one-note outing, required to be relentlessly upbeat, which he does superbly. The scene where he moves his mother to tears on the phone plays on this astutely. Forcing two young brothers to live apart for their own selfish ends could be represented in darker tones, even as abuse, but Kore-eda keeps it all light and humorous, through the simple trope of having the children be sensible and down-to-earth, and the adults, especially the bickering parents, petty and immature. The sub-plots, involving sponge cake and acting ambitions, are so removed from the main story strand that they give the film an episodic, slightly meandering feel when they pop up. Ultimately they are distracting, making the story busier than it needs to be. They also stretch the running time to over two hours. While some will delight in spending time with such engaging children, the film felt flabby to me after the 90-minute mark. The ending, while admirably avoiding sentimentality, takes too long to come around. \n\nSuch is Kore-eda&apos;s stature that a host of A-listers pack the minor roles giving them more gravitas than normal. Jô Odagiri as the musician father, Kirin Kiki as the grandmother, and Hiroshi Abe as a disciplinarian teacher ply their day-shifts admirably. \n\nThere is a lot to enjoy in I Wish, but lacking the damning social critique of Nobody Knows, and the acerbic scalpel on family life of Still Walking, this is Kore-eda choosing to crowd please rather than stretch himself.",

      "reviewBody": "Apart from featuring Klaus Kinski&apos;s name prominently on the DVD-cover, &quot;Lifespan&quot; also caught my attention because there were a lot of Dutch-sounding names in the cast. Indeed so, this bizarre cult co-production entirely takes place in the beautiful city of Amsterdam and the makers admirably took the effort to cast local actors and actresses for the supportive roles. It&apos;s a derivative and slow, but nevertheless compelling Sci-Fi/thriller about science&apos;s eternal quest for immortality. The ambitious American student Ben Land enrolls into the University of Amsterdam, eager to learn from his idol, Dr. Paul Linden, who allegedly stands on the verge of a medical breakthrough regarding prolonging human life. One day after Land&apos;s arrival, however, he finds Linden hanging in a noose from the ceiling (funny how the last thing he said to Land was: &quot;tomorrow I&apos;ll be tied up&quot;). With the support of the Dean, the brilliant and stubborn young student deep-dives into Linden&apos;s research and discovers successful results on lab mice and dubious experiments in old folks&apos; homes. He also takes over the relationship with Linden&apos;s stunningly beautiful mistress Anna and learns about the connection with a mysterious Swiss pharmacist. &quot;Lifespan&quot; is tense and absorbing, but it seriously suffers from a lack of action, and particularly fans of horror &amp; gore will be sorely disappointed! The film was released under the Mondo Macabro label but, like with &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, I don&apos;t feel it really belongs among the other titles there. As for Klaus Kinski, this was clearly just another easy paycheck for him to cash in. Throughout half of the film, he only stands around and observes Ben Land from a distance. Later on, his role is slightly more extended, and he even gets to fondle ...&apos;s beautiful naked body whilst wearing an antique death mask! You&apos;re the man, Klaus!",

However, the movie turned out to be so much more. The limited use of special effects give it an authentic look. Schaffner makes fine use of his equipments and crew. The reddish mountainous desert-landscape is mysterious and fascinating. The cinematography is good too. The makeup is terrific and beats what any CGI could have done. The plot is simple and yet engaging. One wonders what Taylor&apos;s fate will be. Just one you think it will take a predicted turn, you are thrown away with a surprising but layered twist. Some parts of the film are quite disturbing to watch (the museum sequence and the ending). The legendary Charlton Heston does a great job. Even though he brings the same persona that was evident in his other works, it is what Taylor required. However, the show-stealers are Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter. Hunter&apos;s funny, witty, compassionate and clever Zira and McDowell&apos;s nerdy, dedicated and devoted Cornelius bring a wonderfully humane quality to their characters. &apos;Planet Of The Apes&apos; deserves to be watched because it is a well-made and marvelously acted film but it also raises some relevant questions regarding humanity and nature."

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re familiar with low-brow 70&apos;s Italian sex comedies (and why would you be?), you might know that the most low-brow of the bunch were the the &quot;insegnante&quot; series, where Edwige Fenech plays a ridiculously sexy schoolteacher, and the &quot;liceale&quot; series, where Gloria Guida plays a ridiculously sexy high school student. While both of these series were done by the same group of directors (i.e. Mario Laurenti, Michele Tarantini, Marino Girolami), strangely, the &quot;insegnante&quot; never met the &quot;liceale&quot; on-screen (thus passing up a golden opportunity to for a stern Fenech to administer a good sound spanking to a petulant Guida). What both of these series DID share, however, was the dubious comic stylings of Alvaro Vitali, who sometimes played a teacher, but usually played the oldest and goofiest-looking high school student in the history of public education.\n\nFor better or worse, this particular film is the Alvaro Vitali show all the way. Neither Fenech nor Guida is in it. Vitali here has apparently been sent back to junior high school, so all his classmates are basically children. And what we have is basically a 70&apos;s Italian forerunner to Adam Sandler&apos;s &quot;Billy Madison&quot;. &quot;Pierino&quot;, Vitali&apos;s character, is a literal man-child who likes to play pranks on and insult everybody around him. He has a flatulent grandfather, a doting mother, an uptight older sister, and a harried restaurateur father. He goes to school with children, but he&apos;s also mature enough to root around in the bushes with a willing high school lass and to fall madly in lust with his incredibly sexy substitute teacher (he keeps arranging &quot;accidents&quot; for the regular teacher to keep the substitute coming back). Here though he has some competition from the studly male phys.ed.teacher.\n\nVitali is not as annoying as he can be, and occasionally he is genuinely funny in this. Michaela Mitti, who plays the sexy substitute, is a third-rate Fenech or a second-rate Guida when it comes to being a comedienne, but she definitely has a first-rate body like the two more famous actresses. Generally though, while this movie has a lot of &quot;adult&quot; humor, it doesn&apos;t have as much sex or nudity as some of the other films in the &quot;insegnante&quot;/&quot;liceale&quot; series. It&apos;s actually pretty appropriate for a 13-year-old audience (or at least for those who are 13-years-old at heart). Incredibly, this has gotten a recent English-language DVD release, so while it&apos;s certainly not my personal cup of tea and I can&apos;t exactly rave about it, it&apos;s pretty easy to see at least, and as good as place as any to start if you just want to get a taste of goofy 70&apos;s Italian sex comedies."

      "reviewBody": "From Hammer Films, &quot;Cash on Demand&quot; is a good thriller from 1961.\n\nIt&apos;s Christmas week, and in the office of City &amp; Colonial Bank in Haversham, it&apos;s a quiet day. The small staff is managed by Harry Fordyce (Peter Cushing), a business-only nerd who exudes no warmth, no holiday spirit, and does not fraternize with the help. He won&apos;t even let the staff put up Christmas decorations.\n\nToday there is a ten pound discrepancy and he&apos;s making a big hullabaloo about it, even though the error was spotted.\n\nIn walks Colonel Gore Hepburn (Andre Morrell), who represents the bank insurance company. He is doing a surprise inspection of the security. When he&apos;s alone with Fordyce, he informs him that he&apos;s a thief, there to steal the bank&apos;s money, and that he&apos;s holding Fordyce&apos;s wife and child hostage. One signal from the window, and they&apos;re done with.\n\nHepburn has the robbery planned down to the second, and Fordyce must play along. In the outer office, Hepburn acts like an efficient man, checking out the floor signals. Fordyce is a wreck but tries not to show it. He carries out all of his instructions, which include putting the money into suitcases (Hepburn&apos;s &quot;luggage&quot;).\n\nVery suspenseful film, and one wonders if Hepburn will be able to get away with the robbery, and if Fordyce will be implicated in any way. \n\nPeter Cushing is tremendous in the role of Fordyce, cold, stern, and highly disciplined, living a life where there are no shades of gray and mistakes are not permitted. As Hepburn, Andre Morell is excellent, charming even when he&apos;s talking about the most deadly things.\n\nThe ending is a little rushed and a tiny bit confusing, but the story is a nice little take on &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with Scrooge Fordyce learning a few life lessons. Highly recommended. I saw this on a double disc with &quot;Stop Me Before I Kill.&quot;",

I didn&apos;t read the book but it&apos;s hard to believe H.G. Wells could write a book so uneven in it&apos;s treatment of a man suddenly endowed with a gift for miracles. At first he is timid and reluctant to do anything noteworthy, then by the end he goes completely overboard in the opposite direction - and that is an understatement.\n\nBut then there are the special effects, which are eye-popping for this time period. Did you think the effects were remarkable in &quot;King Kong&quot;? This picture makes those look simple by comparison, and that&apos;s the real reason for my rating. The cast was fine and it&apos;s hard to quarrel with Roland Young in any movie he&apos;s in, but overall the story was a disappointment. You can &apos;suspend your disbelief&apos; to a point - to approximately a half-hour from the end."

      "reviewBody": "Being french and a film maker myself, I have high standards for ratings, and this one definitely deserves in 10/10. I&apos;ve not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy&apos;s first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the &quot;Joconde&quot; or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes..."

      "reviewBody": "Loosely adapted from Ernst Lothar&apos;s monumental novel and directed by Karl Heitl following an absence of ten years, this is not only the history of an upper-middle-class, piano-making dynasty that covers the period 1888-1938 but is, most importantly, a portrait of a tumbling nation.\n\nLothar had, for obvious reasons, fled Austria prior to the Anschluss whereas actress Paula Wessely had welcomed it and together with her actor/husband Attila Hoerbiger had appeared in the notorious &apos;Heimkehr&apos; for director Gustav Ucicky. It was considered, not least by the Americans, that by appearing in Hartl&apos;s film they would successfully distance themselves from the Nazi regime and that by playing a Jewess, she would be well and truly denazified. It is safe to say that her stunning and sympathetic performance certainly served its purpose.\n\nWessely had played the part of Christine in Schnitzler&apos;s &apos;Liebelei&apos; on stage but was passed over for the film as she was not considered photogenic. Although not a beauty she possessed that indefinable quality common to the greatest artistes and seemed somehow lit from within as well as having a mellifluous speaking voice. Under Hartl&apos;s sensitive direction she exhibits charm, grace and dignity. It must be said that her character in this is more innocent than in the novel and her relationships with Crown Prince Rudolf and Count Traun are portrayed as platonic. Her link to Rudolf&apos;s suicide is of course historically tenuous to say the least.\n\nIt is an absolute joy to see the slim and youthful Curd Juergens who had become an Austrian citizen after the War, Maria Schell in her first starring role and Oskar Werner in his film debut. Both Schell and Werner were to reprise their roles in the somewhat limp British remake and Anton Edthofer reappeared as Emperor Franz Josef as he could hardly be improved upon.\n\nThe film should really have ended with the bombing but the makers felt obliged to add a Hollywood-style ending complete with heavenly chorus but this is perfectly acceptable for its time as the film itself was designed as a vehicle to aid Austrians to overcome their past whilst the final panoramic view of the city with St. Stephen&apos;s Cathedral being rebuilt must have gladdened many a heart. The shot of the angel with the trumpet potruding from the rubble is particularly touching as for Austrians it represented what one film historian has termed &apos;a symbol of purity, art and heartfelt nationalism expressed through its love of great music&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "In Manhattan, the successful executive Jack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is a methodical and controlled man with simple habits that works in an advertisement agency with his coworker George (Peter Stebbings). While smoking a cigarette on the roof of the building of the agency, Jack meets the aspirant actress Jill (Taryn Manning) that has just arrived in New York and is seeking a job. He sympathizes with her situation and gives her name to a Klubendorf commercial in the campaign promoted by his agency. When he takes Jill home, he finds that she lives in a very low-budget hotel and out of the blue, he invites her to stay in the guest room of his fancy apartment for a while. Jill changes the behavior of Jack that becomes happier, and proposes Jack to write together a manifesto where the first rule is &quot;be honest&quot;. However, she omits to Jack that she is sick with cystic fibrosis and she would have only a couple of years more. When Jack discovers that Jill is ill, he feels betrayed with her violation of their first rules, and they split. But Jack is changed and sooner he decides to seek out Jill.\n\nI was looking forward for the next work of Vanessa Parise since the lovely &quot;Kiss the Bride&quot;, where this director and actress develops the themes family, relationship, feelings and love in a nice low-budget movie. &quot;Jack and Jill vs. the World&quot; is a sweet little movie about happiness, sympathy, love, illness and commitment with two lead characters that have opposite behaviors and backgrounds, but feel attracted for each other. The story has potential and seems to be slightly inspired in &quot;Storie di Ordinaria Follia&quot;, but is predictable and entertaining. However the screenplay could be improved with a better development of Jack and Jill characters in the very beginning; the health situation of Jill could be deeper and more dramatic; the relationship of Jack and his father Norman could be also better explored since it is one of the best moments of the movie: and last but not the least, the conclusion is not well-resolved and needed some improvements. But in my opinion, there are unfair reviews in IMDb. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Regras do Amor&quot; (&quot;Rules of the Love&quot;)",

As he played a very rattled and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role. His character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as Sandler made me. For someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input. I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Don&apos;s characters rode the motorized scooter around the city. I familiarized with the moment, because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam does to get away from it all. With his video games, music, and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth the watch.",

      "name": "It&apos;s still not &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; but this is a fitting conclusion for a perfectly good fantasy trilogy",
      "reviewBody": "Did Peter Jackson really just conclude his second Middle Earth trilogy? His take on J.R.R. Tolkein&apos;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was a completely exhausting adventure that in many ways feels like seven films, not three, while &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy feels exactly like it is on paper: one straightforward adventure broken into three parts. &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; proves a fitting, exciting conclusion to this particular trilogy, but compared to the conclusion of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; quite frankly and pun intended – it gets dwarfed.\n\nAs with &quot;The Unexpected Journey&quot; and &quot;The Desolation of Smaug,&quot; &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; is another beautiful achievement in fantasy filmmaking, with stunning production value and an outstanding director in Jackson. It is creative, humorous, action-packed, brimming with talent and gravitas and so many of the things that made &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; the achievement it was. So why was this trilogy less acclaimed and somewhat anti-climactic? Part of this undoubtedly has to do with novelty. We&apos;ve been to Middle Earth before, we&apos;ve seen the makeup and the elaborate sets, we know how Jackson navigates a battle sequence. Although &quot;The Hobbit&quot; has new locales and new characters and was the first film series screened with a higher frame rate, it&apos;s not as groundbreaking an achievement. Also, that accomplishment set the bar high for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; given how many people have returned from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; on camera and off.\n\nYet the real culprit is story. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a children&apos;s book, so splitting it into three parts is merely dragging out a streamlined plot of &quot;company seeks treasure and justice, company faces challenges along the way culminating in a mighty dragon, company overcomes odds.&quot; The added subplots put more meat on the bones of the three films, especially &quot;Desolation,&quot; but did not necessarily add complexity or maturity to it.\n\n&quot;Five Armies&quot; at least does not waste any time. The first act is entirely buildup to the titular battle with plenty of suspense as sides try to negotiate in order to prevent an unnecessary war when a much greater evil is growing in Middle Earth. After Smaug torches Lake-town, Thranduil (Lee Pace) and the Wood-elves march upon Erebor, where Thorin (Richard Armitage) has reclaimed his rightful throne. Thorin, however, is corrupted by his greed, and rather than help the displaced people of Lake-town, grows restless because his treasure&apos;s focal point, the Arkenstone, has yet to be found. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who has been hiding the Arkenstone, sees Thorin&apos;s madness could cause a senseless war, which of course it does, only the battle takes a different shape when Azog the Defiler and his orc army arrives.\n\nSo corruption and selfishness become dominant themes of the film until the final battle, which doesn&apos;t disappoint in scale, entertainment, or visual effects. What it doesn&apos;t do, however, is command a vested interest from the audience. And when the larger battle halts entirely in order to follow the main characters, it hurts the larger overall narrative, or rather, calls attention to the fact that there really isn&apos;t one at this point in the story other than &quot;kill the orcs.&quot; Yes, the fate of Middle Earth is at stake, but we already know how things will ultimately play out.\n\nSomeone who has never seen the films watching all six in order could be something special, though. &quot;Five Armies&quot; does make &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy a rather strong bridge to &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; even in its last shot. In a way, Jackson acknowledges that that tale is the bigger story, the one that matters most. The parting message is kind of like &quot;we hope you enjoyed these three fun movies, but &apos;The Lord of the Rings,&apos; that&apos;s where it&apos;s really at.&quot; As moviegoers who witnessed &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; this doesn&apos;t quite work for us, because we wanted to go back to Middle Earth for something more, to build on the experience of &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; however, like any good prequel, is the foundation, not the next step, and because the story is so simplistic, it doesn&apos;t quite do enough for us on its own.\n\n&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a fun, small adventure filled with courage, danger, evil and love set in the world of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and &quot;Five Armies&quot; is that big scene at the end of the story where everything comes to boil. That&apos;s the gist of it. The rest is Jackson and his extraordinary cast and crew bringing that elaborate world back to life for us to enjoy one more time.\n\n~Steven C \n\nThanks for reading!

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Voyage Home&quot; (a.k.a Star Trek 4) ranks as my most loved &quot;Original Series&quot; based film. The other Kirk and Co adventures were good but just not as good as this. The comic value of this film is just great and I think that this was what made the film so loved by some and hated by others. For me however, the crazy adventures of the ever aging cast placed a smile on my face and a laugh in my mouth. This deserves at least 7 out of 10.",
