If you watch it closely, Belmondo&apos;s way of doing this farce charms even his partners. Genevieve Bujold breaks up many times, you can see her drifting along Belmondo&apos;s playful act. Even the minor characters have funny lines and a chance to show their talent - and they do.\n\nI don&apos;t speak French, but the Hungarian dub is awesome, funny, witty, so I guess the original dialogue is top notch too.\n\nAnd another positive aspect of the film that it&apos;s full of love - amorous and friendshiplike too.\n\nIf you want a light hour full of laughs and joyful moments, watch this :)",

I thought this film was very underrated and with the Judd Apatow dreck that gets called film-making these days this really stands up in beauty and depth of story. The cinematography of the Northwest coast was amazing and incorporating the dense forests and lush environments into the shooting process was simply amazing.\n\nThe acting was perfect and at times understated in wonderfully blocked scenes between the characters. I thought the action is unmatched by many films pretending to be the action blockbusters they are often sold as. I often marveled at the length in which the filmmakers brought the setting to us no matter how difficult the set-ups seemed.\n\nI hope he keeps making films for years to come! Beautiful!"

(I&apos;ve always felt Jeremy Fisher was a distant cousin.)\n\nThere are hints of danger with the cat looking down the mousehole, the silent, blinking owl, and the strings of sausages that give the game away. The stories are much, MUCH darker! I&apos;m glad no rats featured, and the pike that nearly gets Jeremy is a mere shadow.\n\nOnly flaw - it goes on just a bit too long, and the pastiche music gets a bit samey.",

You can imagine it made him a quite controversial character since he frequently pointed out the persistent conservative state of mind of the whole political class (right and left).\n\nPierre Carles, documentary film maker, followed this exceptional man on several public performances in Colleges and seminaries, as well as interviews, and pointed out without any kind of directive attitude, how charismatic the man could be. Furthermore, the film gives us some essential clues to understand part of his work.\n\nThe film runs for more than 2 hours, Bourdieu&apos;s way of speaking is not quite as perfect as we are used to hear on radio or T.V., but we &quot;drink&quot; every word of his non-stop speech from the beginning to the end. Highly instructive! The other film by Pierre Carles &quot;Enfin Pris&quot; also deals with that personality after he passed away in 2002 just to insist again on how impossible it was for a man of that stature to get a chance to express himself on mass media. The eternal struggle of &quot;form&quot; Vs. &quot;content&quot;. Just unique!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of the French film &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; by Luc Besson. I&apos;ll say right off the bat that I strongly suggest watching that one instead, since they are virtually indistinguishable but this one is just a clone, a (not so cheap) imitation.\n\nAs with many foreign films that are remade for American audiences (like &quot;Let the Right One In,&quot; &quot;Funny Games,&quot; or &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;), I&apos;m often left feeling hollow after viewing both versions. The original was, well, original, which is why it gained international acclaim at the time, opening doors to Luc Besson for productions like &quot;Leon&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Element.&quot; With this Americanized repeat, there&apos;s nothing added, no extra twist, no real reason to remake a perfectly good first film, other than the fact that Americans don&apos;t like to read subtitles. It&apos;s no wonder Luc Besson refused the offer to direct; seems pretty boring for an artist to make the exact same movie again within five years of the first.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s a perfectly watchable film, but I&apos;m not liable to give it any credit beyond that since the whole thing was lifted from a movie made only a few years before this. Bridget Fonda is solid, and makes the transition from despicable junkie to government assassin pretty believable. Gabriel Byrne, of course, does well in his role, but I think this character has a very limited range compared to that of which he is capable. Dermot Mulroney is easy on the eyes but his character is not particularly memorable.\n\nGood action, a little romance, and Bridget Fonda kicking ass. Plus a small role for Harvey Keitel at his peak, fresh off of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Bad Lieutenant.&quot; The shootouts are pretty par for the 90&apos;s, with squibs exploding everywhere and the usual shots of the protagonist diving through the air in slow motion. At the time, the role-reversal of having a female spy/assassin as the lead was pretty unique, but nowadays, of course, that is not so uncommon at all.\n\nSummary: totally watchable, but totally unnecessary.",

Having lived in Berlin until the mid 80&apos;s and being the same age as Christiane F. I can only stress the authencity of both book and movie. Berlin was a dark and depressing city at the time, yet a true metropolis with all its problems. You didn&apos;t have to be part of the &quot;drug scene&quot; to notice it everywhere in the downtown and surrounding area. Strung out junkies hitting you up for money in subway stations, streetwalkers, prostitutes at the Bahnhof Zoo ... the magazine article, followed by the book and movie just kind of brought it out in the open and documented the problem. The movie is still relevant 20 years later, one just have to put it a bit in perspective.\n\nThe soundtrack with David Bowie&apos;s music (newly rereleased on CD) is powerful and fits the overall mood perfect. Note: Christiane F. continued to struggle with her drug addiction until 1996 when she had her son. She lives in Berlin."

If you are a fan of &quot;enemies to lovers&quot; type of storytell, this one is for one. The movie is long, per usual, because of the songs (definitely not my favourite album, but a few good ones), but the movie was so captivating to me, I watched it in one sitting!\n\nPitty that old Bollywood movies are being forgotten. Love is always represented in its truest and realest form, one can only wish for! The movie has no additional drama, that &quot;adds&quot; to the plot, characters are true to themselves from the beginning, which contributes to the developing of a good love story.",

Not a single person who worked on this &quot;film&quot; cared if it&apos;s good or bad. I can literally picture them sitting around a table at one of Warner&apos;s offices saying &quot;how are we going to steal their cash?&quot;. There&apos;s NO saving grace. The acting is awful, and that&apos;s putting it nicely. The direction (or lack there of) is just as bad. It&apos;s a directors job to push the actors to get the most out of them. However, Malcolm D. Lee evidently didn&apos;t care, as the final product is trash. Then again, what was I expecting from the director of Scary Movie 5? Oh and don&apos;t get me started on the &quot;comedy&quot; (palms face).\n\nLets call this what it really is, a cash grab. I even took my nephews and niece (who&apos;re young) to see this and they didn&apos;t even like it. They threw Looney Tunes in there because hey it worked once, why not spoil an old films legacy like Hollywood loves to do with lame remakes.\n\nI feel most bad for Don Cheadle. This Is a huge stain on what was a respectable acting career.\n\nPlease do better.",

      "name": "Pleasant but Minor Claudette Colbert Vehicle",
      "reviewBody": "Sold as and considered a comedy, SHE MARRIED HER BOSS is actually a light-hearted &quot;women&apos;s picture&quot; with only occasional comic moments. Claudette Colbert stars as the executive secretary of department store owner Melvyn Douglas who has secretly been in love with him for seven years although he has never seen her as anything more than a very valuable assistant. Wealthy Douglas lives in a mansion with his frosty, hypochondriac sister Katherine Alexander and his bratty nine-year-old daughter Edith Fellows, product of his one unhappy marriage (it&apos;s never stated if Douglas was widowed or divorced but one presumes the latter given the hostile memories both he and Alexander have of his former wife).\n\nClaudette&apos;s moneyed pal Jean Dixon is appalled how she is wasting her youth pining for this uninterested man and tries to break her away from him and toward rival store owner Michael Bartlett. When Dixon informs Douglas that Claudette is quitting her job to work for Barlett (untrue), Douglas is desperate to keep her and learns part of the reason is her desire to someday marry, he proposes to a surprised Colbert who happily accepts (the scene is curiously not filmed) only to learn shortly after the marriage that it basically remains little more than a business relationship. Meanwhile Bartlett is not giving in even with Claudette now a married lady (after all he himself is still legally wed!) \n\nThis is a pleasant film smoothly directed by Gregory LaCava but it really needed a rewrite and maybe revised casting. Claudette is perfection as always in this type of role but Douglas (whom often comes across as the &quot;dull suitor who loses the girl&quot; in the romantic comedies in which he is actually the &quot;real love&quot; in the picture) fails to show any hint of charm that might have bewitched her all these years although his poorly written character doesn&apos;t give him much to work with. The delightful comedienne Jean Dixon - so wonderful as the maid in La Cava&apos;s MY MAN GODFREY - is badly cast as Claudette&apos;s chic older, sardonic buddy in a part that cries for Helen Broderick. \n\nEdith Fellows, however, is terrific as one of the most realistic brats on screen in the 1930&apos;s, a pathological liar who talks back to adults and bullies dogs. Edith&apos;s scenes with Claudette as a no-nonsense but warm stepmother tries to reach out to her are extremely believable and sensational. It&apos;s also a pleasure to see Grayce Hale, usually cast in unbilled bits as fat and stupid women, given a fairly sizable supporting role as Claudette&apos;s assistant at the office that completely lacks the ridicule she usually is given on-screen. Katherine Alexander is acceptable as Douglas&apos; sister and comedian Raymond Walburn (unrecognizable in his early middle-age from his best known period a decade later in movies) is for the most part excellent as the long-suffering butler.\n\nThe movie has a shocking lapse of taste in it&apos;s use of drunk-driving (by Walburn) as &quot;comedy&quot; (in crowded city streets no less!!) although this may have been a period when the issue was not taken as seriously as it should have been. SHE MARRIED HER BOSS is definitely lesser Colbert but this is one actress who is always worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "I first want to say that if you are a fan of the books, you will NOT be disappointed. Compared to the first movie adaption, this one soars, leaving the other movie to die out in the hot desert sun.\n\nI had re-read the book a day before I saw it and so I could see what the critical changes were. I would know every fine detail they let out. I first have to let you know that every book-to-movie adaption can&apos;t have 100% of the book in their. Plus, the new director, Francis Lawrence, had to clean up the mistakes the first director left out. Another thing, all the very important and even some parts you might think Hollywood would oversee is stitched together.\n\nThis has to be the BEST book-to-movie adaption I have ever seen. The visuals, for one, is spectacular. $140 million budget was not wasted, that&apos;s for sure! The director packed every little intricate piece possible to make it THE BEST experience us fans could have.\n\nThe acting was phenomenal. Katniss is a lot more lively now, because Jennifer Lawrence finally understood her character. The whole cast, including Sam and Josh, were amazing. Even the actress who played Johanna Mason, was FUNNY!\n\nThe music, however, copied the first, because I bought the first soundtrack, so I know every little musical detail. They must have used the same music and added a few more. That was sad. But, it did fit with the scene.\n\nThe action and suspense will never leave you, as the ending is a cliff hanger, holding on for dear life! (Hunger Games book fans: you won&apos;t be disappointed with the ending)\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, this movie, Catching Fire, really does catch fire and immerses the audience in the Hunger Games. I was truly speechless after the film because it was just so beautiful and satisfying. You don&apos;t want to miss the best film of the year, and possibly the highest grossing film of all time!!!",

This Walt Disney production directed by Ken Annakin is a sumptuous costume film, and your eyes will gloat in the flamboyant colours and scenery - it is a regular feast for the eyes all the way. Although Charles Major&apos;s novel romanticised the true story somewhat, and the film has romanticised it even more, there is still a great amount of original charm coming so to say directly from the 16th century, giving a very positive and inspiring picture of the golden age of the Tudors. The novel was my grandfather&apos;s favlourite novel, he read it many times, and it was by surprise I came across the film and found it was a screening of that novel. Richard Todd is irresistible as Brandon, as is also Glynis Johns as Mary and James Robertson Justice as a slightly overdone Henry VIII, but above all it is a thoroughly enjoyable and uplifting film, more Hollywood than Tudor England, but still with very much of the Tudor spirit well taken care of.",

      "reviewBody": "If the movie lacks anything it is the beauty of the photography in films like &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; and &quot;Windwalker&quot;. Otherwise I can&apos;t find any serious flaws. It is rare to find a decent movie about prehistoric peoples. &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; is the best movie of this kind in my opinion but &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; is a close second.\n\nI am not trying to compare &quot;Cave Bear&quot; to the books by Jean M. Auel. To me the film takes the best part of Auel&apos;s story and makes a pretty good movie. The later Auel stories become more romance novel fodder and to some that may be more entertaining. &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; is not romantic. It captures the brutality of prehistory very well for a fiction film. I&apos;ve seen documentaries about the Neanderthal and was surprised how accurately &quot;Cave Bear&quot; showed that time. The flaws in human nature are shown in all their rawness in this movie. There is prejudice, oppression and abuse in full force. What makes it bearable for me is how the Darryl Hannah character is able to deal with this and eventually over come it.\n\n&quot;Cave Bear&quot; also shows some of the ritual of stone age culture with the Shaman and the hunting rites of passage. There is some beauty in that culture. But the bottom line for these people is survival and that was a very difficult thing to accomplish. They were scratching and clawing (literally) just to eat and raise children. And sadly we know that they are doomed (except for a few Neanderthals who possibly interbred with Cro-Magnons).\n\nThis kind of documentary approach in &quot;Cave Bear&quot; will not thrill those who want a stone age comedy-romance, &quot;Caveman&quot;, or a special effects absurdity of prehistoric people fighting lots of dinosaurs, &quot;One Million BC&quot;, (which is historically impossible). But if you can appreciate an intense story of a young woman&apos;s survival in the wild and her experience with a lost stone age culture, then I recommend &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot;. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "When Loretta Young beat out Rosalind Russell in the Academy Award sweepstakes of 1947 it was considered one of the great upsets in the history of Oscar. Russell had gotten a lot of acclaim for her dramatic breakthrough performance in Mourning Becomes Electra which was RKO&apos;s prestige picture of the year. The O&apos;Neill drama flopped at the box office. Young was nominated almost as an afterthought to round out the field in 1947. Of course RKO didn&apos;t care because The Farmer&apos;s Daughter was also one of their films.\n\nYoung worked hard to get her proper Swedish accent for the film and the results would have made Greta Garbo proud. I can&apos;t see Garbo appearing in a film like The Farmer&apos;s Daughter though.\n\nYoung plays Katie Holstrum who leaves the family farm to study nursing and in an almost Forrest Gump like set of circumstances winds up working as a maid in Congressman Joseph Cotten&apos;s home. She&apos;s not working for just Cotten. Presiding over the home and the state of Minnesota itself is Cotten&apos;s mother Ethel Barrymore. Ethel&apos;s not only queen of her own roost, but she&apos;s a Senator&apos;s widow and still one formidable power in her state of Minnesota. And there&apos;s Charles Bickford the family butler who got an Oscar nomination himself in this film for Best Supporting Actor as Young&apos;s gruff, but kindly mentor.\n\nAlthough at the time this film was made Young was 34 years old she does manage to convey youth here. It worked in this case because in 1947 a lot of people were starting their careers late. It&apos;s pointed out in the story that she stayed on the family farm while her beefcake brothers, James Arness, Keith Andes, and Lex Barker were all in the service during World War II.\n\nA long running television series was adapted from this film with the tragic Inger Stevens in the lead and William Windom in Cotten&apos;s role. Cathleen Nesbitt was the grande political dame. The butler&apos;s role was dropped and Windom was made a widower with two boys. Even with a genuine Swede like Stevens playing Katie, Young still comes out the better.\n\nToo bad Rosalind Russell never got an Oscar, but Loretta Young was one of the great survivors of Hollywood and her award was as much an award for a lifetime as for the still fresh and funny, The Farmer&apos;s Daughter.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a very big fan of Dennis J√ºrgensen&apos;s books, have read nearly all of his work. So when I find out he&apos;s written the screenplay for a Danish horror movie, of course I make sure to see it. However, the book of this film is easier to come by than the movie itself, so I read that first. I was in no way disappointed; reading the book is like reading the script of one of the American slasher masterpieces, like Halloween, only in J√ºrgensen&apos;s style. I heavily recommend it to fans of J√ºrgensen. I don&apos;t, however, recommend this mess of a slasher movie. The script is written by J√ºrgensen all right, but a good script doesn&apos;t equal a good movie. Having read the book, I could recognize a lot of scenes and lines, but the film just lacks the intensity and mood of the book. J√ºrgensen has always had a talent in giving the reader chills down the spine, unfortunately it doesn&apos;t seem that this can be successfully copied into film; or maybe this just had the wrong director. Not that the cast helps much; most of the actors talents stretch no further than reciting their lines. They convey either too little or too much emotion in almost each scene. The plot is good enough, but it&apos;s the same as in the book, so you might as well read that. The actors are, as I said, either acting badly or overacting. The characters are fairly diverse, but they lack the development that the book supplies. A lot of the book was compressed to make sure the movie wasn&apos;t too long or boring. However, with so little development, you barely care at all about the characters, and therefore you don&apos;t feel for them when they die. The effects are weak; the death scene effects are especially below average. I realize that Danish films have less money than American do, to spend on effects, but I&apos;ve seen independent films that had better effects. The movie does have some fairly good atmosphere in the beginning, but this quickly vanishes and we&apos;re left with some (sub)standard attempts at shocking you, by having a character leap out of the shadows every five seconds. Some parts of the story, which were scary in the book, also seem ridiculous and laughable in the film; for example, when I first read the end of the book, I actually had a chill down my spine... when I saw it in the film, I chuckled, mainly at the bad acting. All in all, an OK slasher film, average at best. I recommend this film to fans of slashers, but I urge you to read the book first/instead. It&apos;s far better. 5/10",

As Tintin and captain Haddock along with the botcher Dupont brothers (In Spain are named Hernandez and Fernandez , who this time are pursued by a bull at some graceful and funny scenes) travel in Spain , when an old colleague of Tournesol , Doctor Zalamea (Angel Alvarez) is kidnapped . Later on , professor Tournesol is also abducted by a gang of nasties . Tintin and Captain Haddock try to discover what is so desirable about their old friend and his location . Meanwhile , they are helped by a band of children led by Pablito (Pedro Mari Sanchez). After a while , the truth comes out and battling over-the-top bad guys .\n\nThis is a fun , light , adventure comic book adaptation with hilarious moments here and there . It has Tintin and his inseparable friends captain Haddock , absent-minded professor Tournesol , the bungler Dupont brothers taking on , as always, against stupid enemies , and ruthless and mean international delinquents and Arabs . Here Jean Bouise steals the show as grumpy , drunken Captain Haddock , as he runs , fights , dances Flamenco , does gestures , Indian dancing and many other antics . This live action movie of the popular &quot;Tintin&quot; comic-book magazine brilliantly captures the outrageous adventures, tongue-in-cheek , satire, comedy ,taking the characters and some elements from original stories . Although contains some silly scenes and a medium budget , however being a lesser effort than previous entry titled ¬®Tintin and the golden Toison¬® . This amusing movie is accompanied by lively musical score by Antoine Duhamel with a catching leitmotif on the start and the ending . Full of humor , it&apos;s a funny entertaining for kids and grown-ups . Entertaining screenplay isn&apos;t based on the known comics by Herge but originally written by Rene Goscinny , Asterix&apos;s author . Based on the unforgettable characters created by &quot;Herg√©&quot; born under the name Georges Remi on May 22, 1907 in Brussels, Belgium. As a child, Herge had a gift for drawing but never had any formal training in the visual arts. He attended both school and the boy scouts during the World War 1 and post-World War 1 era. After he finished school Herge published his first ever cartoon: &quot;The Adventures of Totor&quot;. 1929, Herge introduced a cartoon about a traveling Belgium reporter (Tintin) accompanied by his fox terrier (Snowy) traveling the Soviet Union. By 1930,Herge published the very first Tintin book: &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;. After that , followed a weekly magazine in 1946 . Later on , it&apos;s published successful comic books as ¬®Cigarrettes of pharaoh, Treasure of Rackam the Red ,Tintin and the scepter of Ottokar¬®. Tintin soon became Herge&apos;s &quot;ligne Claire&quot; (French for clear line) legacy. The later adventures of Tintin involved other locations of the world from China ¬®The blue Lotus¬® all the way to America as ¬®Tintin in America¬®. After completing 23 books, Herge passed away on March 3, 1983, leaving &quot;Tintin &amp; the Alpha-Art&quot; (The 24th book) unfinished . Under Belgium publisher Raimond Leblanc&apos;s guidance, the boy reporter became the hero of a weekly children&apos;s magazine, with Herg√© as the artistic director and magnificent creator of the immortal personage . Later on , Raymond Leblanc produced the following films: ¬®Tintin in the lake of Sharks¬® and 1970 ¬®Tint√≠n in the temple of the sun¬®. The picture will appeal to Tintin comic-books buffs . An agreeable , funny adaptation from a great comic book.",

      "reviewBody": "That&apos;s right, my girlfriend turned to me in the movie and said, &quot;I think BarbWire was better than this.&quot; Her opinion and mine seemed to carry through to the whole audience in the advance screening we went to last night. The audience was laughing at the horrible acting, terrible script and crap camera work.\n\nSpecifics: Lohan works in a strip club where women are topless, yet she never takes the top off and even in sheer bra has pasties on (or were the pasties on top of the bra?). I could care less about seeing her naked, but if you are playing a stripper you might have to at least imply nudity with well placed hands.\n\nSomeone decided to inject humor into the movie into the most awkward places. The biggest problem was trying to figure out why people were laughing more during the &quot;serious parts&quot; than the &quot;funny parts&quot;.\n\nCharacters come in, spout some wisdom and disappear behind a rock like the Dungeon Master. I have a feeling that they are supposed to be angels, maybe God himself? \n\nThe twists in the movie are tough to swallow. I will not even come close to ruining them, they are not even worth ruining. Someone thought they could write a M. Knight script, but failed.\n\nOverall, this movie would be worth a rental from the dollar kiosk at the grocery store, as long as everything else is sold out. I am glad I got in for free. If you do decide to spend money to see this movie, send me the cash instead, I will then hit you in the groin, you will enjoy it more.",

      "name": "If not the best depiction of the famed hero, &quot;Jose Rizal&quot; is a great example of a grand Philippine epic.",
      "reviewBody": "Happy Rizal Day to everyone! And as a special tribute to the national hero of my home country and hometown, here is an updated overview of the 1998 epic biopic, which I once considered the &quot;best film of Philippine cinema&quot;.\n\nIt is overwhelming to realize the influence that this film brought to the country. In obvious reasons, it comes from the understanding of the famed hero and his exploits. &quot;Jose Rizal&quot; then succeeded on interpreting Rizal&apos;s life story. As it should be, this film is a helpful module for students and others who have yet to know about Rizal.\n\nBut glancing over that, others may seem to overshadow its slight faults. Though technically, &quot;Jose Rizal&quot; did excellently in its attempts to depict a Spanish-occupied Philippines, with its authentic sets, still cinematography, blend of sounds and images, and Marilou Diaz-Abaya&apos;s excellent direction. Its execution is nearly pitch perfect. Though it has to be set back by the story.\n\nNothing offensive to the story. In fact, in a roaring 178 minutes, you feel the Rizal&apos;s story coming to life. The backdrop is Rizal&apos;s imprisonment in Fort Santiago, and the rest of his story was shown in flashback. Best parts were definitely intertwining Rizal&apos;s monologues with excerpts from his novels &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot; and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;. Though the effort was excellent, the attempt was too tight to depict Rizal as a &quot;chosen one&quot; on a hero&apos;s journey. And the end result is the movie going by the numbers to properly tell Rizal&apos;s story and the rising of the Philippine revolution. At the end, screenwriters Ricky Lee, Jun Lana and Peter Ong Lim had done a fine job, bringing Rizal&apos;s life, piece by piece. A minor complaint, I could have expect more grand from Rizal and more emphasis on its surrounding crucial history. There was indeed more material than what was depicted. But helpfully, the film respects its audience&apos;s receiving thoughts. The saving grace, thankfully, is Cesar Montano, who had done a magnificent work portraying the titular hero in a stilted yet affectionate manner. He really deserves honor in what I can call his signature movie role. The cast ensemble of familiar faces of local showbiz provide gravitas needed for every sequence. But the standout is definitely Jaime Fabregas as Rizal&apos;s defendant, Luis Taviel de Andrade. The ensemble acts this out like a three-act play but it was worth sitting through.\n\nJust applauding the excellence that &quot;Jose Rizal&quot; achieved makes it reasonable that other Philippine biopics used its templates for theirs. (See &quot;Baler&quot; and &quot;El Presidente&quot;.) Beneath all that, I am going to claim that &quot;Jose Rizal&quot; may not be the best film that the Philippines has to offer. But it was a stepping stone in excellence for the local film industry. Thanks Ms. Diaz-Abaya.",

She had the clearest voice and such enunciation. She was a miserable woman tho and thats why you never hear other singers give her praise. In this film her singing is as tear jerking today as it was on those old 78&apos;s. She sings and you understand every word and in this movie you even can see her do a little shimmy for which she was renowned for early in her career. A great cast. Lena is superb as always and Bubbles from the vaudevillian team &quot;buck and bubbles&quot; along with earl snake hip tucker. These are Harlem legends that ruled 133rd street (the real swing street) in their day. My mother never tires of this movie as she was a devout Ethel fan all her life (she was born in 1923) so she grew up listening to this legend. Get this bit of American history"

Many movies show the characters drinking heavily, but few show the consequences as vividly as in the beginning scenes. The character of Jefferson Bailey was flawed and almost disgusting, but his end of the road status was necessary to propel the plot forward. Maybe the story was too neatly tied together(finding someone and something important at the pawn shop)but I liked the characters enough to go along with the plot. I cried at the end. I cared about the characters, wanted them to overcome their pain and grow. The music was great, sets seemed like places I&apos;ve been and it was good to see Michael Clarke Duncan, along with Tom Skerritt and the large cast of newer or unknown actors.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Romance&quot; is the story of a love that cannot last between a world famous opera singer, Rita (Greta Garbo), and a rector (a preacher), Tom (Gavin Gordon). They fall in love but their lives are too different...and she has a past. This past the film never says, but you can only assume this implies she was promiscuous and was probably Cornelius&apos; (Lewis Stone) mistress.\n\nI am going to say something very shocking to many readers. Although Greta Garbo is considered one of the screen&apos;s greatest artists, I cannot understand this...especially as I watched &quot;Romance&quot;. &quot;Romance&quot; is a lovely film in many ways, but Garbo is the problem with the picture. Her acting just seems so dated and over the top. While it played well in 1930, here in 2021 she seems almost ridiculous in her overacting. Additionally, her accent is just bizarre...and captions really would have helped to make her understandable.\n\nIt is a real shame, as in many other ways the film is quite lovely and has the glossy MGM look. Some fine acting by the rest of the cast, lovely music and nice cinematography...it&apos;s a pretty and sentimental film but one that just didn&apos;t work for me due to Garbo&apos;s odd acting style.",

Christopher Connelly and Tony King make a great double act and director Deodato was obviously having a good time directing something more entertaining than his previous film THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK. Find this film and enjoy, because they don&apos;t make them like this anymore!"

      "name": "BETTY (Claude Chabrol, 1992) **1/2",
      "reviewBody": "Claude Chabrol may be best-known for kicking off the Nouvelle Vague movement with LE BEAU SERGE (1958) and for being the French master of suspense; that does not mean that he dwelt exclusively in the thriller genre and, indeed, hot on the heels of Chabrol&apos;s unexpected adaptation of Gustave Flaubert&apos;s MADAME BOVARY (1991), came this oddball feminist melodrama which, a minor effort though it might be, also proves a surprisingly engaging work.\n\nActually, the source novel for it was the handiwork of celebrated pulp writer Georges Simenon and Chabrol&apos;s film version is buoyed by a spunky central performance from the ill-fated Marie Trintagnant (the daughter of actor Jean-Louis and director Nadine, she died in 2003 aged 41 from a cerebral haemorrhage, following a beating-up by her live-in boyfriend!) and a quietly mature one by Chabrol&apos;s former wife and frequent muse Stephane Audran.\n\nThe title character is a woman who, marrying above her station, is subsequently thrown out of her house after she gives in to her baser instincts; as a result, she takes to an aimless existence on the streets, drinking and chain-smoking her nights away in the company of strangers. Thankfully, she is picked up from the gutter by an enigmatic middle-aged woman (with a much younger companion) who installs her into her own lavish apartment and gradually helps her pick up the pieces of her broken-down life. But the innately sensuous qualities of the waif-like Betty soon catch the attention of her benefactor&apos;s boyfriend and, perhaps inevitably, tragic circumstances ensue.\n\nThe low-key qualities of BETTY are countered by Chabrol&apos;s decision to structure his film as a complex maze of flashbacks which depict (and contrast) the stuffy, ordered, aristocratic lifestyle the protagonist suffered through in her married past, versus her new, chaotic but free-spirited present state. All in all, therefore, the film can be counted as yet another feather in Chabrol&apos;s prolific and largely consistent cap.",

If the director want to do a sincere cop movie, why does he has to give a james-bond type of characterization (I observed the similar mismatch in yesteryear&apos;s release Mallanna). The entire movie is divided into four parts - mother sentiment, speeches, action episodes and romance. The director succeeds in mother sentiment aspect. Speeches are partly good. Action sequences and romance part are negatives to the movie. There is a newspaper headline in this movie that reads as - elukanu pattina puli. After spending such amount of budget and creating huge hype, the final product delivered suit the headline mentioned above. On a whole, Komaram Puli disappoints despite of terrific performances of Pawan Kalyan and Saranya.",

A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid-back big-shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. Penelope Cruz manages to be blisteringly erotic in a few well-crafted scenes and without removing a stitch of clothing. Later, instead of following the usual pattern of despair in the second half where most drug movies home in on drug dependency, Blow refreshingly focuses on the emotional losses suffered by the characters. A film that just about manages to be more than the sum of its parts, it would have made a nice sort of pre-quel to Traffic, but it stands alone in fine form. And it&apos;s moving rather than depressing.",

It was a long time before I finally saw the whole film.\n\nIf you watch the accompanying Just Desserts documentary on the double-disc DVD, you&apos;ll see how lovingly crafted this film really was. Not only so, but this truly transcends the schlock horror of its E.C. origins. The acting is first rate and the plots surprisingly thoughtful, considering how short each segment is. For example, watch Aunt Bedelia&apos;s tortured graveside monologue in Father&apos;s Day, or the curious interplay between Henry and Dex in The Crate. E.G. Marshall totally nails it in They&apos;re Creeping Up On You, the segment most loaded with subtext.\n\nTom Savini&apos;s make-up effects are excellent and he doesn&apos;t scrimp on the gore. The one segment I dislike is Something To Tide You Over, as it&apos;s a particularly nasty and sadistic story (despite the just desserts moral).\n\nOverall, this has a worthy place in the annals of 80s horror and will always hold fond memories for me; a young boy who just wanted to see that crate monster tear his victims apart like sour bread.",

      "reviewBody": "Far from the popular but meretricious so-called &quot;parody&quot; genre, this saga of Spartacus as slave and gladiator is a labor of love from familiar porn stars, including director Marcus London and his wife Devon Lee (both in lead roles) and their essential collaborators Tommy Gunn (seen in the &quot;Making of&quot; documentary literally creating sets, costumes and weapons himself from scratch) and Tony DeSergio. It plays and looks like a real movie, only with organically integrated explicit (and thankfully concise) sex scenes.\n\nThe only quarrel I have is that like many an ambitious project, it is structured as just the first part of a story (hence, &quot;The Beginning&quot; in its title) and four years later no completion feature has been released. Given the economics of Adult Entertainment (with free generic content so available on-line) it is virtually impossible that a major feature sequel will be made.\n\nLondon&apos;s literate script has the cast declaiming in the language and manner of some BBC project with Derek Jacobi or Jeremy Irons, and he has meticulously cast talented actors, including many Brits, in major roles. Even non-sex roles are peppered with top XXX talent like Ben English as Tanya Tate&apos;s husband, a dignitary visiting protagonist Batiatus (Tony DeSergio)&apos;s home in Capua.\n\nMain story line concerns crafty Batiatus&apos;s plans to advance himself, attracting a major gladiator event to his home turf, that sets the stage for the film&apos;s exciting climactic battles involving Spartacus, fellow gladiators and the unbeatable Androcles. Though the actor is shown in the &quot;Making of&quot; documentary, for some reason the player in Androcles&apos; role is not credited in the otherwise quite extensive end credits crawl.\n\nSome of the best scenes involve the beautiful leading actresses. Notably Tate is perfect, with her famous regional Brit accent, examining the private parts of the gladiators, and picking Spartacus to hump her, which London does in a terrifically staged and directed rough sex bout, the way she likes it. Devon Lee in apparently her final XXX starring role is glamorous MILF, redoubtable in her various sex scenes and acting quite well too. Younger talent is highlighted by Gracie Glam and Andy San Dimas, the two most talented actresses of this time frame, while London wisely casts the fabulous, underutilized Jenna Presley as his wife, who is finally reunited with Spartacus for a sexually stimulating and dramatically fulfilling finale, hurt by the trick ending that was designed as a cliffhanger to set up the nonexistent Part 2.\n\nMale casting also reflects care, with Tommy Gunn and TJ Cummings (as a gladiator headed for tragedy) just the right body-beautiful physical specimens to stand beside London in the arena. Throughout the film the costuming is imaginative and appropriate, with no high heels but instead believable sandals for the ladies.\n\nClearly a big budget compared to other porn projects, it is still an economical feature that doesn&apos;t waste money or time on gaudy set-pieces, but rather brings a naturalism to both the visuals and the sexual content. The other London-directed films I&apos;ve seen, shot for Penthouse, Adam &amp; Eve and others, are fairly routine but this one is special."

The film is one of the first full features made in Cambodia since the 1970&apos;s when the Khmer Rougue Regime took over. In 1975 films and other cultural activities were ordered to cease, and subsequently many actors, writers, and directors were executed. Eventually the Khmer Rougue fell, and Cambodia started to rebuild there film industry. What make this movie even more remarkable is the fact that it was made without any many of the essentials one needs to make a film, or even movie theatres in which to show it. Not to mention the complete lack of acess to such things as &quot;digital effects&quot; that Hollywood is all to reliant on these days. Yet some how they were ale to pull it off. The movie features some beautifully shot scenery, and may be worth the price of admission for the Ankor Wat(sp?) scene alone. Although there are some problems with the visual aspects of the movie, remember the resources the filmakers were dealing with, the color is very good. Pich Chanboramey does an excellant job as Soraya (the lead), as well as the other actors in the film. This film is a must see, and is hopefully a indication of a new renaissance of Cambodian film making. In case you were wondering why that Snake hair looks so real? Well.........it&apos;s really live snakes glued and tied to a headset",

The other problem I have is the story based on the interaction of two men from two generations is just not very credible. Why would Pavel choose to create all the problems for himself? \n\nApart from these faults, it is a watchable film. You are treated to some unusual Arctic landscape, and given a taste of what life would be like living in that part of the world, in total isolation from the rest of civilization and conducting repetitive tasks. Even in summer, that part of Arctic can still be harsh and dangerous. The acting by the two actors was pretty solid and camera work good.\n\nSo don&apos;t get me wrong. This film is still a good example of contemporary Russian cinema, cinema not based on sex, killings, CGI or a fat budget. The difference between the generations - one of duty and devotion to work, and the other less so and distracted by video games and loud music - was well explored. It just could have been a much better human drama if the storyline was more credible.",

An asteroid of less than mammoth proportions is released from its intergalactic moorings and is sent hurtling toward Earth. Needless to say, havoc and chaos ensues. It usually does. And a crack crew is sent up to investigate and advise on the situation. The sets and props have an old &quot;Tommorrowland&quot; feel about them. I can&apos;t tell if any of the actors are giving good performances. They&apos;re all dubbed. And poorly at that. I do recognize the lead actor as the fellow who played Vincent Price&apos;s nemesis in Last Man on Earth. But just when you think all is lost, the final scene arrives like a wayward rescue craft. The movie, in need of repair, saves itself with a scene so well shot, so well staged, and so well scored, it will leave you speechless. And later it will leave you muttering to yourself...&quot;what could have been...what could have been.&quot; Blast off!",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve probably seen this one over a dozen times now and I still love it, but mainly from the standpoint of the music. You have to forget you are a film buff (you are, aren&apos;t you?) and think of it as a collection of pop videos from 1930. And the pop ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous: My Heart Is Saying, in colour (?) nicely sung by Helen Burnell but danced atrociously, to Only A Working Man in b&amp;w by the incomparable Lily Morris. Praise the Lord this film was made if only for her two turns, also the Will Fyffe bits and the Cicely Courtneidge end song, I&apos;m Falling In Love. How that one passed the censor at the time I&apos;ll never know ... I suppose no one told him!\n\nHelen Burnell must have been the dancing inspiration for Jessie Matthews, or did all Show People dance like hippos pretending to be trees in the 20&apos;s? I&apos;ve always loved the work of Jack Hulbert, mainly for his innocent British enthusiasm (and songs), but I&apos;m afraid that he looked like a manic bus conductor in his one dance scene. Rotund Teddy Brown was marvellous to listen to - until he started telling jokes; The 3 Eddies - ah! Can you just imagine them walking on stage and launching into their high powered act nowadays? Horrified silence would follow, but how times and tastes have changed. The song Ladies Maids Always In The Know sung and danced to by the Charlot Girls would likewise be incomprehensible to nearly everyone too.\n\nThe glue that &apos;holds&apos; all this and more together is supplied by Gordon Harker trying to get a picture of it all on his TV and Tommy Handley as TV linkman, with some surprisingly flat gags for a change. A running gag is supplied by Donald Calthrop attempting to perform Shakespeare; Anna May Wong puts him in his place - have you ever seen &apos;Taming of the shrew&apos; with a massive custard pie fight or with a circling riderless motorcycle being whipped?\n\nIf you&apos;re going to watch this for the Hitchcock bits and are unmusical you won&apos;t like it, but if you can open your ears and hearts to these fine personalities from a bygone age then like me you may get something like innocent merriment from Elstree Calling.",

I was encouraged by you guys&apos; reviews and decided to give this film a try, but I have to say you guys fooled me successfully. \n\nThis is so far one of the worst films out of China or Hong Kong(part of China now). Why these investors who got too much RMB never thought to donate it to build more schools for the poor, build some roads or safe little bridges in the countryside for the Chinese poor but instead wasted it on such drive-you-nuts foolish farce is always a myth that I could never understand.\n\nDO NOT waste your time and dough on this ridiculousness, please."

      "reviewBody": "Not too long ago, many were slaughtered, and there was a fraction that got all the attention and the blame. The problem is that there were parties that just stood by while others committed these crimes and/or either approved or even participated in their execution. The film explores how there was more to history than we have been exposed to, that the horrors were worse than anything we could imagine, and the devil shows his ugly face in more than one way.\n\nTwo brothers find themselves at the heart of the story, which begins as a some type of thriller/conspiracy the likes of which we have seen before. For a while the spirit of &quot;Chinatown&quot; comes to mind, and a beautifully crafted film slowly unfurls a narrative where the mystery expands, the cast of the dueling parties grows as new layers are revealed, and eventually the film combines elements seen in old fashioned thrillers, horror movies, and even a touch of noir here and there.\n\nWhat takes the film to a higher category is that what we see here has basis on real historical events, and as we realize this, our souls hurt because the pain is too much, and it might be that there is the possibility that we can become one of the parties involved. After all, free will has always been at the core of the worst human decisions in history. Either we want to destroy, to save, or to remain quiet and allow the evils to continue and grow. Liars have for years assisted those who either killed or stole, and they condoned quietly the actions of others by not interfering.\n\nFilms like these makes us remember how ignorant we are, in many different degrees by either not learning enough, not being willing to change and by not facing what really exists in our own souls.",

Director did an amazing job on a low budge and completed filming in 2 weeks. This movie proves powerful truly satisfying &amp; interesting films can be made without famous actors and big budget!! \n\nThe film is based on the Director&apos;s true childhood experience of seeing her family separated by a deceptive government who made false promises to its People. \n\nActing is superb and very convincing. Great story that carries you and holds your attention; leaving you with a new sense of appreciation for our personal &amp; political freedoms. Highly recommend see this film.",

      "reviewBody": "I will say this for American Pie, it&apos;s not full out of completely gross out humor like Van Wilder (2002). It&apos;s got a couple of scenes based on crude humor, but I was glad to see that for the most part, the movie steered clear of over the top disgusting humor. The characters are good hearted boys that think they just want sex, and for a couple of the characters that turns out to be true, but for a couple other of them, it turns out that just &quot;getting laid&quot; isn&apos;t the most important thing. I liked that the characters actually ended up to have a deeper want and that they actually end up having better connections with girls that yes may involve sex, but that&apos;s not all that it&apos;s based upon. Now this movie isn&apos;t all love and good hearted stuff, it&apos;s got plenty and I do mean plenty of raunchy/dirty humor. Humor that involves male and female masturbation in different ways, premature ejaculation, and very descriptive talk of all kinds of sexual activities. Just FYI in case any of that offends you. There is some truly funny material in the film, I laughed at several scenes in the movie. I didn&apos;t think it was laugh out loud hilarious, but some parts were funny. The parts I wasn&apos;t laughing at, I was feeling for the characters. I loved the acting from all the cast members. Tara Reid was really good as Vicky. Jason Biggs was a perfect choice for Jim. Thomas Nicholas is great as Kevin. Chris Klein is very good as Oz. And the rest of the cast is good too, but Kevin, Vicky, Oz, and Jim are the biggest characters here. I loved how Oz and Kevin were so adorable and were actually good hearted guys. I really like American Pie because not only is it funny but it&apos;s also good hearted and filled with good characters. 8/10.",

The given history is interspersed with scenes from Lust for Life, starring Kirk Douglas.\n\nThe whole thing comes across as a combination of a movie trailer and a DVD &quot;making of&quot; extra. It gets the job done, garnering interest in the movie, and gives a few behind the scenes particulars, including Douglas having a conversation, in French, with a local gal who knew Van Gogh.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch for film or Van Gogh buffs. The TCM print I saw ran 20 minutes.",

Its a movie just like all the other viewers have told you....its not meant to be a spoof LIKE The SUPERHERO MOVIE or any of those others like EPIC MOVIE and stuff...which are all pretty much lumped together as far as quality. I was pretty stunned to see the actor that ends up being with lacy chebert do so well.. hes&apos; not the best actor but will get better...I&apos;m sure with the right castmates hede be more versatile than Topher Grace with a gun in Double Jeopardy.",

Then I saw a trailer that Criterion put together and my hopes were dashed. It just looked incredibly obnoxious. So I was steeling myself for a trying experience. In actuality, it&apos;s a mix of my premature impressions. Something like a Looney Tunes cartoon come to life, the film is bursting with colorful scenes, zany action, sight gags, slapstick, wordplay (much of which I assume is lost in translation), irreverent humor and wild camera tricks. I have to applaud the energy and inventiveness that Malle brings to the screen, it&apos;s a unique, anarchic and bold film with echoes in Tati, Jeunet and others. However, it&apos;s still a bit obnoxious. It&apos;s a weird sensation to be simultaneously charmed and annoyed, but very little of the comedy appealed to my sense of humor. It&apos;s all too wacky and madcap. Like HELLZAPOPPIN&apos;, I admire the spirit of it and kind of had fun with certain parts, but I doubt I would ever sit through it again.",

I suppose for those unfamiliar with Putin&apos;s rise to power this would be a good enough introduction, but it&apos;s hardly as good as it could have been.\n\n5/10"

It has some drama, suspenseful music and scenes from start to finish, and even a bit of romance (but not nearly enough to make this a romantic or &quot;chick&quot; movie).\n\nEach of the chosen actors were perfect for their part and they portrayed assigned characters beautifully. They were very likable and believable.\n\nI&apos;m not going to compare this movie with any other, but if you&apos;re like me and love movies such as The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, Inception, Dream House, etc... I promise you will love this movie as well. You also, like me, may decide to immediately watch it the 2nd time to see if there are any clues you missed preparing you for the last 15 minutes of movie.\n\nOut of over 700 movies in my collection, only 32 have a 10 star rating. This movie comes VERY close to that category. Definitely a must see!",

Rick lives with a delightful fianc√© (Lysette Anthony) but no wedding date has been set. One day, Richard inherits his relatives books and notes, only to stumble upon the secret formula used to create the infamous Mr. Hyde. He mixes up a batch and drinks it. However, Richard is in trouble when his alias turns out to be a conniving woman (Sean Young). Is there a way out of this mess? Fans of romantic comedies will likely be happy to add this to their list of viewing pleasures. Daly, Young, and Anthony are all very attractive performers, with charm oozing everywhere. The rest of the cast is delightful, too, with Jeremy Piven doing his usual good turn. The plot may be silly but it is fun, too. As for the interior of Richard&apos;s apartment, it is to die for; one may want to put the VCR on pause to recreate the look. In short, if you like fast, fun films with some kisses thrown in now and again, this one is for you.",

      "reviewBody": "I attended a VIP screening of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol last night at the Darling Harbor IMAX Theater in Sydney, Australia. Before the movie started, there was an introduction by Director Brad Bird, and by actor Simon Pegg where they shared how much they enjoyed making the film and shooting scenes in the IMAX format.\n\nI won&apos;t get into the story too much as I don&apos;t want to ruin it for anyone, but the basic plot is that the Kremlin in Russia is bombed by a terrorist group and IMF is framed for it. Because of these actions, the president decides to activate Operation Ghost Protocol, which essentially means that the entire IMF organisation is disavowed, meaning Ethan and his team are on their own, and like the tagline says &quot;No Plan, No Backup, No Choice&quot;.\n\nThe story I found to be quite solid. Nothing groundbreaking but enough to keep the interest of your average movie-goer.\n\nThe performances were generally good all around. Simon Pegg was enjoyable as Benji and Tom Cruise is always great as Ethan Hunt. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton also gave some great performances. \n\nThe action sequences are where the film really shines. Not all scenes were great, I thought the bombing of the Kremlin used some very fake looking CGI which made it more humorous then intense. Also, some scenes seemed a little too far-fetched and made me think that Tom Cruise must be made of steel or something. But if you try not to look into this too much, then chances are you will enjoy the action. The fight scenes were done very well, incredibly brutal and realistic looking. The sound for this film really helped as you could almost feel every punch and kick as well as the explosions. The greatest scene for me was Ethan climbing the hotel in Dubai, the worlds most tallest building. Shot in IMAX as well, I almost felt like I was right there next to Ethan looking down from above. Huge credit goes to Tom Cruise for performing this stunt himself!\n\nOverall, I found the film very enjoyable. I enjoyed it a lot more than the 2nd and 3rd entries, but the 1st has always been the best one for me. I would have given this a perfect 10 but it loses 2 points for the some of the action scenes being a bit silly and unrealistic.",

      "reviewBody": "So I am fresh off of watching this and I have to say that I am a bit disappointed. The trailer and the current reviews made it out like this was going to be a blast to watch, and some parts of it were, but for the most part I felt pretty let down.\n\nSo this is an anthology film, but instead of running each story back to back the film instead runs them simultaneously throughout. So basically you jump around from each story, the main problem here is that I found two out of four of the stories to be pretty clich√© and boring. It was a bummer to be right in the middle of one story that is picking up only to be thrown back to a story that is just plain boring. The pacing was a big problem too, nothing at all really happens until about an hour in, once things do get rolling it is decent but not enough to make up for the first dull hour.\n\nI do have some good things to say, the Santa and Krampus scenes were absolutely awesome, it mostly made me wish that I was watching a movie that was strictly about them. The acting was well done throughout, and the special effects/gore was all top notch considering they didn&apos;t have a huge budget. Plus William Shatner is thrown into the mix, hard to hate that. \n\nI feel like this could have been so much better because the parts that worked did work really well, but the stories just didn&apos;t blend well together and since you have to watch them all at once that really effected the entertainment of the overall film. It&apos;s rare that I truly hate some parts of a film but then absolutely love other parts, unfortunately with this one the good was not good enough to out weigh the bad. The fun parts were still really fun though, it just seems like the whole thing could have been a lot more fun.\n\n5.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Krush Groove is the most underrated rock n roll movie of the 1980s. Is it the Best music film  of the 80s? No that title belongs to Purple Rain. Actually Krush Groove attempts to redo Rain&apos;s successful formula, using talented musicians generally playing themselves in a fictitious story with some realistic elements. It actually came out a year or so too early,  with rap and hip hop still generally  a black phenomenon despite Blondie&apos;s #1 pop `Rapture&apos;. (Debbie Harry makes an appearance here portraying a club singer.)  The one `Actor&apos; not playing himself was Blair Underwood who played the character Russell Walker  (While the REAL Russell Simmons played a stage hand named Crocket)\n\nThe story deals with a number of rap artists Run DMC, Kurtis Blow and the Fat boys in their efforts to make it big as hip hop stars. It deals with the good and bad of having a hit record on a small independent record label, competition between two brothers over the heart of a young female singer (Sheila E.), the consequences of borrowing money from a loan shark, the opportunity to sign with a major label  and a talent contest looking for new hip hop talent. The contest includes an appearance from New Edition, an all too brief appearance from future superstars The Beastie Boys and an in studio audition from LL Cool J. The film was rated `R&apos; generally for some mild violence and usage of the `F&apos; word. (Six instances where two would automatically mean an `R&apos; rating) It didn&apos;t do too hot at the box office. I had stated that the film came out a year or so too early. The reason I stated this was that in 1986, one year following this film&apos;s release,  Run DMC&apos;s cover of Aerosmith&apos;s Walk This Way  got heavy airplay on white radio, even going to number1 on album rock radio in Aerosmith&apos;s homebase of Boston MA. This success opened the door for The Beastie Boys, The Fat Boys, LL Cool J, Will Smith (known at that time as The Fresh Prince) and a large number of other hip hop and rap artists to score BIG on the Pop singles and pop album charts."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Hans le marin&quot; is the first cinema movie directed by Fran√ßois Villiers, who had already shot a few documentaries. After Hans.., he worked for TV, his second cinema movie was shot in 1958. Hans.. was supervised by Marcel Cravenne who wasn&apos;t an experienced director and who also worked a lot for tv. Jean-Pierre Aumont wrote the dialogues, and his wife Maria Montez played energic ally the fatal Dolores boozing with clients at the Kit Kat club in Marseille. The handsome Canadian sailor Eric (Aumont, but with no Canadian accent) falls in love with her but is seriously injured by a hoodlum helped by Dalio (always brilliant in that kind of coward thug). Dolores forgets him thinking he&apos;s dead and disappear. Hans has missed his boat and is now desperate, but he&apos;s helped by Tania the tzigane (Lilly Palmer half convincing with her accent and poor make up). Hans is ready to leave Marseille but by pure chance, he sees Dolores in a car. His mad love wakes up... Despite some mistakes (Aumont&apos;s French accent as a Canadian, Palmer&quot;s German accent as a tzigane and poor make up), Hans.. is a nice blend of French &quot;r√©alisme po√©tique&quot; from the 30&apos;s and film noir from the 40&apos;s. Aumont is charismatic as a tough and determined sailor. All actors playing small characters are convincing. And the cinematography by Jean Bourgoin is a success with long shots, panoramics and travellings. From that same era, Hans.. makes me want to see again &quot;Au-del√† des grilles&quot; by the great Ren√© Cl√©ment.",

Now it is one of my favorite foreign films and probably my second favorite Kieslowski film, under Red. I was so glued to the television while watching this because I was truly interested in the characters.  I saw the 85 minute version and I can say it went very fast because I was completely wrapped up in the story.  The passion that these two characters showed is something rarely seen in film. The fact that it was such a simple film with simple characters is quite important as well because it added to the feel of the film.  I recommend anyone who can find this film see it."

I can&apos;t think of a horror movie with more hugging, kissing, tickling, &quot;knuckle sandwiches,&quot; back patting, good family values and platonic puppy-doggy lovey-dovey, and it&apos;s set in white bread middle class suburbia. David cheerfully tells his neighbor, &quot;If there was a friend of the year award, you&apos;d get it!&quot; Even a psychic&apos;s home is littered with velvet paintings and statues of Jesus! Most of the running time is composed of the boring everyday events of boring everyday people, all set to bad elevator-style Muzak. It copies Stephen King&apos;s short story &quot;The Monkey&quot; and is pure torture from start to finish.",

      "reviewBody": "RAPT is more an experience than a film. It is based on the true story of the 1978 kidnapping of French industrialist Edouard-Jean Empain, a millionaire playboy who is abducted and held for ransom for 60 days. Though it is a very fine thriller of the kidnapping/ransom genre this film is far more than that. It is an exploration of the lives of men of wealth who allow their moneyed status to be able to buy anything, behave in any way they wish, and trample lives of family and friends in the process. Is it a pretty picture to follow? No, certainly not, but it is a revealing fact that a crime of kidnapping can be secondary to a life of greed and consumption of power and money that feeds into lives such as the main character of this film and the governmental agencies to respond differently to these moneyed moguls.\n\nStanislaff Graff (Yvan Attal, in a mesmerizing role) is the wealthy industrialist married to the beautiful and wise Fran√ßoise (Anne Consigny), and also has a lover. He is kidnapped brutally from his limousine on the eve of his visit to China as part of the entourage of the French president. The kidnappers treat Graff cruelly, keeping him blindfolded and tied in a tiny tent in a dungeon of a basement: they demand a fifty million euro ransom. As an acct of proving their serious plot, they cut off one of his fingers. What follows is a terrifying sparring match between kidnappers, police and the board of the company of which Graff is the director. The main question for the board: is a human life worth more than fifty million euros? Will they be able to get that amount of money together in time anyway? While they decide this he degenerates physically and mentally in imprisonment. After sixty days Graff is released to a world now cognizant of his secret life of gambling and escapades and secret apartments that the press dredges up, revelations that are especially painful for his wife. Paying his ransom won&apos;t bury his secrets.\n\nThis film was written and directed by Lucas Belvaux who presents his story with more emphasis on subterfuge and the psychological aspects of the affair that may make the film seem slow moving (125 minutes) but at film&apos;s end we realize that the true crime is not so much that of the kidnap/ransom but the abuse of power and money when so many in the world are suffering from homelessness and hunger and foreclosures etc. The drama is significantly heightened by the work of cinematographer Pierre Milon and the moody musical score by Riccardo Del Fra. This is a demanding film but an important one, and the acting of everyone in the large cast is on the highest level - especially the stunning performances by Yvan Attal and Anne Consigny. \n\nGrady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "This Is A Review Of The Uncut Version.\n\nDario Argento has enriched the Horror/Giallo genre by quite a bunch of brilliant films, including such stunning pictures as &quot;The Bird With The Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970), &quot;Profondo Rosso&quot; of 1975, &quot;Suspiria&quot; of 1977 or &quot;Tenebrae&quot; of 1982. While the brilliant Giallo &quot;Profondo Rosso&quot; and the supernatural Horror masterpiece &quot;Suspiria&quot; are Argento&apos;s greatest achievements, &quot;Phenomena&quot; is a personal favorite. Accompanied by one of Goblin&apos;s most outstanding scores, &quot;Phenomena&quot; is a visually stunning and incredibly suspenseful blend of Giallo elements and supernatural Horror, and a must-see for every Horror-fan.\n\nJennifer Corvino (Jennifer Conelly), the daughter of an American movie star, is sent to an elite girl&apos;s boarding school in the Swiss mountains, more precisely in a part of Switzerland referred to by locals as &apos;The Swiss Transylvania&apos;. The area is currently terrorized by a serial killer of girls, whose victims are always heinously dismembered. Although a friendly and lovable person, Jennifer does not make too many friends in the boarding school, and due to her sleepwalking most of the other girls think of her as weird. But sleepwalking is not her only unusual characteristic. Jennifer loves insects, and insects also seem to have a strong affection for her. While Inspector Geiger (Patrick Buchau) is investigating the brutal murders, Jennifer befriends wheelchair-bound entomologist Prof Mc Gregor (Donald Pleasence), who helps the police with their investigations...\n\nArgento is a master of suspense and atmosphere more than he is a master of logic, but Phenomena is intense enought to forgive some logical flaws. While the plot may not be the most logical one ever written, it works perfectly. Then 15-year-old Jennifer Conelly is outstanding in this, a perfect performance from the beginning to the end. The supporting cast is also very good, the great Donald Pleasence&apos;s performance as Prof Mc Gregor is just one of many very memorable performances in &quot;Phenomena&quot;. As usual for Argento, the movie is impressively photographed on great, scary locations. Dario Argento has always placed great emphasis on impressive colors (especially red, of course), and hardly ever have I seen a horror film as visually and acoustically stunning as Phenomena. The brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtrack by Goblin manages to even intensify the suspense, and is one of the best scores I have ever heard in a horror film.\n\nPartially a Giallo, and partially a horror film with psychic and transcendental elements, &quot;Phenomena&quot; is creepy as hell from start to finish. It is also easily one of Argento&apos;s most brutal movies. Phenomena was also released under the title &quot;Creepers&quot; in the US, but that was a mutilated version cut by 29 minutes, so the 111 minute version is essential. Stunning and absulutely phenomanal!",

A crime film though, that formally switched between extreme realism (Rivette seams to be famous for letting the actors improvise a lot) and absurd postmodernism - but, after all, a fine story about criminals. Only that the criminals were not typical gangsters: a young American (played by an Italian but as he did it convincingly, I accept it) and the child-like and wild and very sexy Maia Schneider. And many more. Oh, and two po-faced musicians who perform the soundtrack of the movie before our eyes, live, so to say.\n\nAnd above all, this movie was very funny - you wouldn&apos;t expect such a funny film from a filmmaker who is weird enough to make a motion picture that has a running time of 13 hours.\n\nI should mention that the girl with whom I saw the movie had a head-ache afterwards.

      "reviewBody": "In theory, I agree with the other reviewer&apos;s evaluation. But what he doesn&apos;t realize is that &quot;Orient-Express&quot; was actually a short-lived European television series -- presumably co-financed by the various branches of the Pathe company (which I know had offices in Britain and France and possibly Italy at the time). Apparently, this was one of those one-self-contained-story-per-episode series, much like &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot; That explains the episodic nature of the film and the fact that it doesn&apos;t follow a coherent story. Basically, like a lot of failed American series of the period, the production company decided to salvage what they could, cobble it together, and release it as a film to maximize profits. Unfortunately, like the other reviewer has pointed out, it simply doesn&apos;t work.\n\nBut as a TV series, &quot;Orient-Express&quot; was not without its merits. It boasted on-location camera-work throughout Europe -- something that no American TV series of the time could do. But perhaps the finest episode, which is partially reproduced in this film, is the one that starred Erich von Stroheim and his then lover (wife?) Denise Vernac. That episode was titled &quot;The Man of Many Skins&quot; and features von Stroheim as a detective who solves cases by figuratively getting under the villain&apos;s skin: he imagines how the criminal perpetrated the crime. What&apos;s even more clever, however, is that he also gets under their skins literally because he plays the role of the villain, too. Thus we get to see von Stroheim, very late in his career (he looks unwell), playing multiple roles -- sometimes within the same scene. We&apos;re treated to the remarkable sight of the egomaniacal von Stroheim playing against himself and probably trying to upstage himself, too! For von Stroheim aficionados, it&apos;s great fun.\n\nThe von Stroheim episode is available in its entirety on Kino&apos;s wonderful DVD of von Stroheim&apos;s own aborted project, &quot;Queen Kelly.&quot; It&apos;s a nice extra, and it gives us a rare late performance from the one-of-a-kind von Stroheim. (It also lets you avoid wasting your time watching this mediocre movie.)",

Very gory and a little outrageous with the violence actually. It&apos;s not as realistic as the first one (even though neither are) simply based off of the first killing scene. No serial killer could get away with such crimes in reality especially one who studies bugs for a living and doesn&apos;t at least have military training to make him the badass he&apos;s portrayed as being. But I&apos;m not going to be such a pessimist, it wasn&apos;t bad. It was a relatively short film so it&apos;s straight to the point. If you&apos;re a fan of violence and gore this is your film.",

As such the music is decent but somewhat dated and the cinematography was fair but sometimes employed the shaky and moving camera angles too much. Those drawbacks keep this from being a great film in my mind, but it is still a good one that I would rate 6/10. Bronson does his usual effective job of being the on-screen presence which carries the film from location to location. This movie is PG, but would probably be PG-13 now, but it is not R level stuff for sure. So &quot;St. Ives&quot; is a good watch which I would recommend if you like this genre.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve gone back and forth on how to rate Five Golden Dragons. On one hand, I really want to like this movie. It&apos;s got an infectious 60s vibe that really worked with me. On the other hand, it&apos;s got a lot of problems and is, in all honesty, a mess of a movie. So, I&apos;m stuck with giving it a wishy-washy 5/10.\n\nI&apos;m not going to do the normal plot summary. There&apos;s no point because there&apos;s not much of a coherent plot. None of it makes any sense at all. I&apos;ll just say that there is a lot of super-secret spy type stuff going on in Hong Kong and it all surrounds a group of five guys who call themselves the Five Golden Dragons (hence the title). What they do or who they are is as unknown to me now as it was before I watched the movie. All I know is that they want to sell-out to the mafia (I think) for $50 million. And there are some other people who would quite naturally like to get their hands on the money. Be warned that all or part of this could be completely wrong - I just don&apos;t know.\n\nOne of the big draws of Five Golden Dragons is the cast. George Raft, Dan Duryea, Brian Donlevy, and Christopher Lee are prominently listed in the credits. However, their combined screen time is about 10-15 minutes and all they do is sit around a table, put on and take off some goofy looking gold dragon masks, and spout some of the most inane dialogue I&apos;ve ever heard. The whole thing looks like it might have been filmed in an hour. Their acting is also pretty funny. They all seem to go through a range of emotions ranging from bewilderment to confusion to amusement to impatience. It&apos;s obvious they realize how bad this thing really is.\n\nMost of the rest of the cast is, however, very enjoyable. I really enjoyed seeing Klaus Kinski, Maria Perschy (wow), Maria Rohm, Rupert Davies, and Sieghardt Rupp. All are capable and do the best with what they have. But the highlight for me was Margaret Lee. Any movie with Margaret Lee is automatically better than it would have been without her. A lot of the movie is more than competently filmed with some very nice shots of Hong Kong. The chase scene through the harbor was especially nice. The movie&apos;s pacing is all over the place. In spots the action is great and the movie has a nice flow to it. But, in others, the film really drags.\n\nFinally, after going through some of the good and bad I found in Five Golden Dragons, I&apos;m left with writing about the one thing that almost ruined the movie for me and keeps me from rating it at least a point higher. And that is Robert Cummings. He&apos;s so bad! I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ve seen an actor irritate me like this. Part of the problem is that much of the time he seems to be acting like he&apos;s in another movie. The comedy he brings to the film is most often completely out of place. His reactions to most everything going on are usually the exact opposite of what you would expect. Also, he&apos;s 100% wrong for the role. Here&apos;s the IMDb summary for the movie, &quot;A naive young American playboy in Hong Kong finds himself caught up in the middle of an international crime.&quot; Young! Are you kidding me? At 57, Cummings isn&apos;t young by a long shot. And his bad dye job doesn&apos;t help. Some of his scenes with Maria Perschy and Margaret Lee are embarrassing. Also, at 57, he&apos;s way too old play &quot;na√Øve&quot;. His stammering, stuttering schoolboy is laughable. Completely and utterly ridiculous! I&apos;m willing to forgive a lot of the faults in Five Golden Dragons, but Cummings isn&apos;t one of them.",

Yes, It&apos;s certainly not a masterpiece, and doesn&apos;t have an incredibly clever or elaborate script, however it has a lot of virtues that deserve a whole lot more than a poor 4.5: First the visual effects are really, really good. Second: the acting in my opinion was also very acceptable, very natural and according to the situation, the way normal humans would react to an extraordinary terrifying situation, an alien invasion; a few clich√© dialog but nothing really to be annoyed for. Another plus is the end: incredibly bizarre and surprising, didn&apos;t see it coming. Finally and most important, it kept me interested all the way till the end, which is what a movie should do. Now, knowing that the budget for this movie was $10 million I honestly think the producers and the whole team did an excellent job. 7/10 seems a fair rating for me and I truly recommend it to sci-fi lovers despite the bad ratings.",

With just the right mix of interview footage, historical photos, and live performance, STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN takes its place alongside THE LAST WALTZ as a cinematic cornerstone of music history.\n\nMusicians will especially like some of the technical discussions, such as details about how legendary bassist James Jamerson produced his famous groove.\n\nThe live musical performances are inspired, with modern singers covering Motown classics, accompanied by the Funk Brothers themselves. I have watched the DVD of this film, and more recently, the high-definition version on ShowtimeHD. The 5.1 soundtrack is impeccably mixed. You can hear every instrument clearly, but the vocalist is not drowned out. With this type of mix, you want to listen to your favorite numbers over and over, concentrating on a different part each time. And, you can rest assured that there is no lip syncing or studio overdubbing. This is real music for real people.\n\nAll of the vocalists are superb, creatively interpreting each song, while at the same time paying respect to the style of the original recording artists. Viewers will have their own favorite performers, but mine is Joan Osborne, whose powerful rendition of &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; brought tears to my eyes.",

      "reviewBody": "In a bicycle race, &quot;breaking away&quot; describes the often-desperate solo move a rider makes in a bid to win the race.  Most riders are bunched together for shared protection against the wind, and to keep an eye on their rivals--a group is always more efficient than an individual.  But in moments of confusion, a single rider might just get a jump on the group and, with superhuman effort, beat the odds against going it alone and emerge victorious. \n\nIn &quot;Breaking Away&quot; we follow the exploits of four misfits just out of high school who contentedly contemplate a future as dead-enders.  They aren&apos;t particularly smart, athletic, or good-looking, and they lack any sense of direction in their lives.  Moreover, as townies, or &quot;cutters&quot; in a college town, they wear a spell of invisibility in their dealings with the students--the differences are painfully obvious.  When they hang out on campus or lamely try to chat up the co-eds, they might as well be ghosts haunting a town they used to inhabit.  Something happened when they graduated from high school and didn&apos;t go on to college:  they became cutters, no better than servants, in their own confused eyes. \n\n When we meet Dave Stoller (Dennis Christopher) we think, here&apos;s a guy who might be able to break out of his own rut.  He seems to be a kid with a little more on the ball than the others.  But then we see that he&apos;s also the most confused--by far.  Dave is wrapped up in a fantasy world where he&apos;s an Italian bike racer, a champion of a sport virtually unknown in America at the time.  That Dave&apos;s charming misfits of friends take him and his delusions in stride shows us the bond of their friendship and shared misery, and just how far off the map they&apos;ve all slid.\n\nAfter a chance encounter with a beautiful sorority girl (Robyn Douglass) Dave pretends to be an Italian exchange student in an effort to woo a girl he believes would otherwise be way out of his reach.  He draws on his obsessive knowledge of Italian culture and his own quirky charm to fool the girl into seeing him as someone fresh and new, an outsider, but not a misfit.  The romance seems to be going somewhere, and Dave feels he&apos;s finally breaking away.\n\nWhile Dave is conducting his fraudulent personal life he also has an opportunity to race with the Italian bike racers he had worshiped from afar. It&apos;s his chance to get recognition from the masters of the sport.  He may not have much going as a cutter, but he&apos;s certain the Italians will see his racing ability and welcome him as one of their own.  But when he shows that he can keep up with them in the race, naively hoping for their approval, they throw him into a ditch.  Dave&apos;s fantasy world comes crashing down.\n\nWhen Dave realizes that the Italians will fight to protect their turf just as much as the Americans he resents, his first reaction is to give up--&quot;everybody cheats&quot; he says resignedly.  And he rejects the friends who had looked to him for something more--his three chums and their own struggles, and the sorority girl, who had seen in him something special.\n\nOnly Dave can save Dave, but it is his father&apos;s hard words that prompt him into action.  To Dave and his friends, a &quot;cutter&quot; is someone who doesn&apos;t measure up to the college kids who are going somewhere in their lives.  They affect being misfits because a misfit is one rung on the ladder above how they see themselves, which is as losers.  But Dave&apos;s father points out that &quot;cutters&quot; were the original stonecutters who built the grand buildings on the campus.  They may not be college-educated, Dave&apos;s father says, but to them &quot;cutter&quot; is a badge of honor for the hard-working men who built something real out of the flat earth.  Dave will never be a &quot;cutter&quot;, he says, meaning a man of accomplishment, unless he finds something equally real to do with his own life.\n\nThe Indiana Little 500 is a bike race the university holds that is taken very seriously by the groups that participate.  At the time, it was the largest race in America, and fraternities counted some of the best American bike racers on their squads.  But to Dave and his friends who are invited to race, it is a chance to prove to the students (and themselves) that their lives so far weren&apos;t just wasted time.\n\nYes, Dave is a gifted bike racer, but we already knew that.  But the Little 500 (and life) requires that one rely upon not just inner strength, but the creative use of the strengths of others.  It is a team race.  What Dave learns when testing himself against these college students that he never felt would give him the time of day, is that the biggest obstacle to his own success was himself.  \n\n&quot;Breaking Away&quot;  is a rich visual tapestry of life lived outside the spotlight.  The characters are not fancy or sophisticated, and their life goals are simple and well within reach.  It is themselves they struggle with, and their perceptions of themselves.  &quot;Breaking Away&quot; is the story of kids who had let their own self-image degrade to the point that a fantasy world, and a life of bitter resentment, seemed like their best option."

      "reviewBody": "Having not seen the original version of The Stepfather I have to say that normally I&apos;m not a fan of remakes, and usually, yes, I do loathe them because they always tend to be a load of crap (Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes for example..). However, since I haven&apos;t seen the original Stepfather film I can&apos;t compare them both, but what I have seen in this remake is something else. I was really, really impressed with this, and I am going to have to seek out the original now to see what it was like.\n\nThe Stepfather basically tells the story of &quot;David&quot; - a disturbed man who is apparently normal and caring on the outside but very unstable on the inside, both psychologically and emotionally and one of who lives a lot double lives, looking for recently divorced women to emotionally manipulate them and ultimately, breaks them down and kills them and any immediate family. I always compare him to the girl out of the Orphan because they both have nearly the same tactics at luring people into trusting them - in fact this movie reminded me of Orphan a lot. Anyway, when he senses he may be in danger of having his history found out, &quot;David&quot; takes even more extreme action to cover his steps up a lot quicker than he would normally do. &quot;David&quot; has been doing this many for years, and also has evaded capture from the police by changing his appearance and never using any ID when purchasing, for example a car. He always pays in cash, and always changes his appearance in somewhat way before moving onto his next victim. You may think it&apos;s a relatively simple plot, but the movie itself is a lot of fun and suspense. There&apos;s also a lot of psychological tension and build up as &quot;David&quot;&apos;s new family become suspicious of his activities and his apparent lack of background information. As the movie progresses, things turn for the worse for the family he has deceived as they become wary of his background.\n\nThe acting is first class, and the guy who acts as &quot;David&quot;, Dylan Walsh? I think that&apos;s his name. He is very convincing in his role. I honestly can&apos;t find one bad thing to say about this movie, as I definitely enjoyed it, and the build up of psychological suspense kept me watching until the very end of the credits. All in all it&apos;s quite excellent, and I&apos;ve given it a 9 out of 10, simply losing one point because it is still a remake, but one that is excellent.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of Orphan or indeed, The Strangers, The Stepfather&apos;s psychological factors may just peek your interests here. Definitely a must watch at some point. Very enjoyable!"

      "reviewBody": "As with Frederick Wiseman&apos;s &quot;Titicut Follies,&quot; the Maysles brothers&apos; &quot;Salesman&quot; is truly a landmark for the &quot;cinema verite&quot; documentary movement of the 1960s. Although the former is shockingly realistic in a sensational way, &quot;Salesman&quot; is actually the more disturbing for showing the Hell-on-earth that marks the workaday world for most of humanity. If ever a film shows that most people &quot;lead lives of quiet desperation,&quot; this is it. In my lifetime of viewing films, I&apos;ve never seen a non-fiction film more affecting and poignant. That this film didn&apos;t make the AFI Top 100 is practically scandalous. Be forewarned, this is an oppressively sad, yet slyly funny, film that is not easy to watch. It speaks volumes about American business practices, the ties between business and organized religion, the exploitation of religious belief (and its perversion via materialism), the dehumanization of workers, the crushing wisdom that can come with aging, the scary mindset of suburban denizens, and a lot more. If ever anyone had the right to ask the question, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot; it would be Paul, an aging Bible salesman having trouble meeting his sales quota, who serves as the film&apos;s central character. The film is brutally honest, yet powerfully manipulative. It does beg the question: how much is real and how much is affected by the presence of the cameras? One does feel, after seeing this, that reality is just as bad as Dorothy Parker said it was. For those who fail, the American Dream is a nightmare. In short, a film you&apos;ll never forget."

The German general (von Stroheim in one of his most telling roles) has been there before - as an archaeologist preparing for the desert campaign long before the war had begun. The notion that archaeologists make good spies (or, in this case, generals) seems to be a common misconception."

Maybe the previous commenter was a rocket scientist himself, but for me, the hurdles these people had to accomplish in the time they did, and the unbelievable success they had is something that made me proud to be an American when I left the theater. The visual aspects of the film left me holding my breath at times. And the story - it was the same story we&apos;ve all seen 100 times - a small group of people working together to achieve the impossible. Only this time, the story is true, the people are real and the goal is the advancement of humanity. Something we can all be proud of in a time when there are not that many things that we should be proud of. Take everyone you can drag with you - there isn&apos;t anyone who won&apos;t be moved by the vistas of a distant planet sent here by a couple tiny robots built by a small group of men and women from the planet Earth who had a dream. Why a 9 instead of a 10? It ended too soon.",

      "reviewBody": "Act of Valour set out to create a film with 100% authentic and realistic action sequences and promote the lives of US Navy Seals. In that aspect it succeeded, however, failed everywhere else. \n\nThe advertisement of using real navy seals as the main characters creates a level of military authenticity and accuracy that I have not seen in a film for a long time. All equipment and vehicles used are used correctly whilst dialogue and radio chatter inside of combat shows detail that inexperienced eyes might miss. However, acting is not something these Seals train for at basic! Dialogue outside of combat is weak at best and any scene trying to get some form of emotion out of the audience is lost as soon as one opens their mouth. Not many good things can be said about the story line. A rather unimaginative plot coupled with the stereotypical &apos;bad guy&apos; does little but create a backdrop for the numerous fire fights and special forces insertions. Lastly, it should be noted that the film was shot in a noticeable High Definition that creates specular grandeur on wide pan shots.\n\nThose looking for a well constructed war film should look else where. The predicable storyline and patriotic American stance will put most viewers off. However, if HD fire fights, good military realism can be taken with a pinch of salt this film does not disappoint.",

      "reviewBody": "I met Donald Cammell shortly after he finished production on &quot;Wild Side&quot; We were at director Martin Donovan&apos;s house in Los Angeles. It was one of those eclectic memorable evenings in front of the fire in that fabulous Italian villa of Whitley Heights. Johnny Whitworth and Liv Tyler were there, so was Renee Zellwegger with her director Dan Ireland, Valeria Golino and Benicio del Toro, Shirley Knight and even Fabrizio Mioni with Faith Domergue, yes the legendary Faith Domergue, Howard Hughes&apos;s prot√®g√®. Donald Cammell dominated great part of the evening, exhausted but bursting with energy. So excited about his new film, about Joan Chen, Steven Bauer and Christopher Walken&apos;s performance. Editing with his long time collaborator, Frank Mazzola. It was a dangerous movie, it walked a very thin line, but he trusted his abilities as an tightrope walker. Years of experience. A few weeks later I was invited to see his cut of the film. I must admit, It took me by surprise. The darkness of the film didn&apos;t seem to match the lovely, kind, gentle Donald. The film was also brutally funny. A very individual, frightening, fascinating vision of the world. Shortly after I found out the film had been taken away from him and re edited. I saw Donald Cammell a couple of times after that, he smiled, he was charming and kind as usual, but in his eyes you could see his sadness. The next time I went back to Martin Donovan&apos;s house was to attend Donald Cammell&apos;s memorial service. He had killed himself, leaving a tangible, painful, tragic void. That day was also memorable, to be part again, with China, Donald&apos;s wife, of an eclectic group, from Drew Hammond and Bud Cort to Ken Russell and Cassian Elwes, to pay tribute to Donald Cammell the man, the artist, the friend. The other version of &quot;Wild Side&quot; hit theater for a second and disappeared without a trace. Frank Mazzola, the original editor, has restored it since, with love and for love of an unforgettable friend.",

Moreover, the cinematography and atmosphere in this film are undeniably superb. The chemistry between two preteen protagonists is outstanding and very believable. Everything in this film is well-made in synchronization. \n\nThis is the first film related to a vampire that I think is least connected to Vampire&apos;s teeth baring at audience all the times, like other familiar horror we used to see. Other than some gory scenes in this film, we can yet see some flesh and blood moment of humane Vampire. And that is truly written to the core plot.\n\nThe last scene at swimming pool is totally mesmerizing and mind-blowing.\n\nBy the way, if Sweden submits this movie to be in competition with other nominees around the world for Oscar foreign-language film category this year, this masterpiece should win or at least be short-listed for the final fives.\n\n10 out of 10",

Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong.\n\nOverall, Blade 2, for the fans of the first one, will not dissapoint them. It contains enough imaginativeness and gore effects to brighten the most down of horror film and comic book enthusiasts.  The film also contains some of the best makeup I&apos;ve seen in a while in a horror movie. A-",

      "reviewBody": "The year is 1855. The place is England. A man going by the name of Edward Pierce (Sean Connery) has his eyes on a near impossible heist. He wants to steal the Crimean gold that goes by railway from one part of England to another. Besides the fact it&apos;s guarded at the time of transit, the safe requires four separate keys that are in three separate locations. Oh yeah, and no one has ever robbed a moving locomotive before. I suppose he could Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid it and force the train to stop, then blow open the safe. But this is England and no such brutish tactics will be used. This will take stealth, guile, and intelligence. In other words, it was a sophisticated operation.\n\nThis was a superb heist movie. It was clever, it was cohesive, and it was funny. I liked the pairing of Connery and Donald Sutherland. Heist movies always have to be clever and cutting edge because the mark is always super-secure and nearly impossible to breach. What sets one heist movie apart from the other is the story within and the characters. This story was straight forward and simple. There were no red herrings, no sappy side stories, and no deux ex-machinas. And the characters were very enjoyable.\n\nThis Michael Crichton film was simply excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "Anytime you have a story set in Salem, you naturally expect witches, fire and dark magic. In A Haunting in Salem, you get the witch, dark events and a bit of burning. From the movie&apos;s DVD cover, it says this story was taken from actual events, so was real life as scary as fiction? The plot centered on the new sheriff of Salem and his family, who&apos;ve moved into a sweet, Victorian home. It&apos;s excessively large, even for four people, but it&apos;d been the dwelling of every sheriff who&apos;d presided over the town for years. While unpacking, everyone experienced strange and unexplainable occurrences, but soon, the entire family is in mortal danger. Sadly, there&apos; s not a soul around who can help with truth, let alone answers.   The story presents a cycle; the very beginning shows you what happened to the previous family, then the new sheriff, complete with mental issues, came along. What you aren&apos;t given is a reason for it all. Was it revenge? Had the previous sheriffs carried a blood connection, allowing the townspeople to invite them, as a sort of sacrifice? It ended, gifting wonder as to why it even happened.   The cinematography, concerning the town and surrounding views were spectacular! Even the house was lovely, but there really wasn&apos;t much as far as storyline. With little scare, A Haunting in Salem entertained, but disappointed.  Cheers!\n\nA Haunting in Salem Written by H. Perry Horton Directed by Shane Van Dyke Produced by The Asylum Stars Bill Oberst, Jr., Courtney Abbiati, Jenna Stone and Nicholas Harsin",

Instead, it goes straight into more stock footage, primarily from parts one and four. The goofball, obviously staged monkey brain eating sequence from the first film is shown again in its entirety; Samuel Berkowitz makes another cameo, as his encapsulation is recounted wholly; the head-in-a-box from part four is here, too. As most of the footage here is lifted whole from the first film, it is appropriately capped off with the closing credits from the first film. It probably took the people at Gorgon perhaps about two hours to assemble this, and slap on some artwork to the video box for release. \n\nSpeaking of the video box, the video box cover artwork is the exact same as part IV. Furthermore, it claims that the run time is 90 minutes. Ha! Try more like about 70 minutes. 70 minutes of crap we have already seen in Faces Of Death 1, Faces Of Death 4, and first compilation, The Worst Of Faces Of Death.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a big fan of films where impressionable protagonists enter a world of images and fictions. The challenge is how to model madness, by what degrees to confuse and clarify. DePalma could do this type of film, fooling with layered placement and identity of the eye‚Äîit&apos;d be as cool as this and obvious in its main thrust about madness, but probably not as ambient. Lynch could in a more powerful way.\n\nThe story is that a shy sound-man goes to work on an Italian exploitation movie, this is to establish him as a creative person who will have to imagine things, and to establish the things he&apos;s going to imagine as of some darkness. He is an introvert, so we can have this conflation of inner and outer sensitivity to phenomena. Funny: shy is here equated with unattractive appearance in the main actor.\n\nThe film is entirely contained on a soundstage and around the studio where the soundtrack is being prepared. The actual horror movie is never seen (except for the opening credits which serve as the credits to our film), always inferred from what we see of the sound-carpet being fitted, the screams and slashing sounds, and this is a crucial point: the horror movie never quite materializes, so there&apos;s widespread negativity in reviews.\n\nOh, we get obvious hallucination in the latter stages that I could do without, linked to movie screens as borders of reality ‚Äî it clarifies too much. But there&apos;s something else I liked, simple and inventive.\n\nAll sorts of sound effects are constructed over the course of the film before our eyes, from ordinary means: melons are slashed, pumpkins are splattered, broth is boiling. The first time we see the effect being recorded, and then an off-screen voice announces what it is supposed to be the sound of, and it&apos;s done a second time. It&apos;s fun to see on a fundamental level as exposing the kind of unceremonious but inventive technical work that takes place behind cinematic curtains of illusion. \n\nBut more marvelous is exemplifying the mechanism of that illusion that creates the imagined horror story in our mind ‚Äî the second time the sound becomes the mental image just described to us. By making it so immediate, it&apos;s a powerful exhibit, observable in your own self, of the mind acquiring illusory images ‚Äî the images become what the off- screen voice announces. Wickedly clever! Because it puts us in the protagonist&apos;s shoes, by introducing a disruptive level of imagination.\n\nSo I think you must see this at one point. Based on his previous film and now this, I have this filmmaker on my short list of talent that I expect he has it in him to be a leading voice a decade from now."

Mickey Rourke was, as usual, an amazing villain, playing the role so well that I never thought back to different roles he&apos;s played in the past to compare them, because there is no comparison. Henry Cavill played Theseus like a boss, and was the perfect actor for this movie. Don&apos;t make the mistake of comparing this movie to other Greek Mythology flicks, because Immortals is in a category of its own. Go check it out when it debuts nationally, you will not be disappointed!"

      "reviewBody": "Whoops I forgot my 3D glasses to experience those mind-popping images (where we are informed when to put them on or take them off), but I doubt that gimmick would have saved this already below-average, if bizarre supernatural/slasher tale from Hong Kong. It looks like it had a bit money behind it, but it feels second-rate when compared to others of its field and that ending is a complete wimp out. \n\nAt least it has going for it some stylish visual brushes by Wai-keung Lau&apos;s frenetic direction and an imposingly eerie setting (an abandoned theme park, which has some freaky looking clown dolls on a hanging tree) with some sensational art direction (like the opening entrance of the clown face). Too bad that it&apos;s senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste &apos;Ringu&apos; clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters. Even throughout it demonstrates some unwelcoming camp qualities, where the witless script and self-knowing humour just don&apos;t come off. It irritated, but not as much as the performances do. Bobo Chan in the lead role never convinces and her screaming/crying gave me a splitting headache.\n\nYen along with her friends are looking for her missing brother, despite the warning from her medium mother that he&apos;s dead. It leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl. Instead of finding her brother they come across restless spirits who pick them off one by one.\n\nThe computer effects are well-done and never distracting, as there&apos;s one memorable decapitation sequence that&apos;s brilliantly executed and there&apos;s a little bit of blood &apos;n&apos;gore in the traditional style. Sound effects hold an atmospheric grip, but those constant whooshing noises and whispering voices could&apos;ve been toned down. The music score wasn&apos;t all that effective, even with some jaded cues.\n\nPretty much like a foreseeable, underwhelming haunted house theme park ride.",

The cover of the Blu-Ray was titled Adventures at the Chocolate Factory, and also had a flying car pictured. It reminded me of a cross between Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I never read the info on the back of the box, that this is a Swedish film and had been dubbed into English.\n\nHowever, the movie wasn&apos;t bad, it was actually entertaining. The only downside is that the English dubbing wasn&apos;t the best, but children will enjoy it nonetheless. It is also not rated, but no profanities are used or anything obscene, it&apos;s a great family film. It also reminds me somewhat of The Cat in the Hat live action feature in the ways of set decoration and costumes. The colors are vivid and bright and will keep a child&apos;s attention.",

Stunning cinematography, great use of 16mm film just help to complement the films great surfers. The great thing about this film is that you the viewer also get to see children of third world countries go out, break away from crime and enjoy the great sport. Between the the mix of pros and amatures surfing along with the occasional body surfing scenes just add on to an already stellar film. The surf soundtrack, much like The September Sessions is top notch. What else is there to say, if you like film, the ocean, or surfing go see it. When the only bad I can find about this film is that is tough to get, unless you order it offline, then you know it is a fantastic film that you should be watching instead of reading my review (thank you to whoever reads it)",

Eve Arden plays Ida Corwin, a friend of Mildred&apos;s who later becomes one of her employees, that gets to say some great sassy lines including &quot;Personally, Veda&apos;s convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young.&quot;\n\nEventually, the daughter gets herself in deep trouble and the mother&apos;s sacrifice is made even greater. Directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on the James M.

Also Supporting Actress Oscar nominations for Arden (her only!) and Blyth (her only as well). The film, its B&amp;W Cinematography, and MacDougall&apos;s (his only) screenplay were also nominated.

It&apos;s one of those amiable films that is virtually impossible to dislike.  It&apos;s not the funniest comedy, nor are there any &quot;big&quot; laughs, yet I can&apos;t find anything lousy about this movie. And as a big plus, Dustin Hoffman is the star!  He&apos;s one of my favorite actors, and I&apos;m eager to see him in anything.  He gives a fine, underrated performance that&apos;s both funny and touching, in an unpretentious way.  His character of Bernie Laplante is no angel.  He&apos;s rude, cranky and selfish. But he loves his son very much, and simply has trouble expressing his true emotions.  It&apos;s always fun to see a serious actor in a comic role.  And the advantage of it is serious actors approach comic roles in the same way they do any other roles.  Like Gene Wilder said, &quot;I approach the role of Leo Bloom in &apos;The Producers&apos; the same way Olivier would approach &apos;Hamlet.&apos;&quot; Hoffman doesn&apos;t act goofy or ham it up, but simply plays it straight and lets the laughs come to him with his natural delivery.  Andy Garcia delivers an endearing performance, and Joan Cusack is amusing as Hoffman&apos;s ex-wife. The plot is predictable and some of the characters are cliched, but overall the film is entertaining and at times moving.  Though it is basically a comedy, it has its human elements that add an earthy quality to the film. \n\n My score:  7 (out of 10)",

      "name": "The Temptress is a standard silent drama with a riveting lead actress",
      "reviewBody": "he Temptress (1926) is a standard little romantic melodrama, the kind of silent film that you find on any silver screen in any town in 1926. It&apos;s packed with super stars ‚Äì directed by Fred Niblo, co-starring Antonio Moreno, Lionel Barrymore, Roy D&apos;Arcy ‚Äì and it possesses one thing that your standard romantic melodrama of 1926 did not ‚Äì Greta Garbo. To say that The Temptress, only her second American film outing, stars Greta Garbo is an understatement. This movie exists solely for Garbo, to give us all the opportunity to indiscriminately stare at her for 106 minutes.\n\nThe plot of The Temptress is a bit convoluted. Manuel Robeldo (Antonio Moreno) spies Elena (Garbo) at a Parisian masquerade ball and the two pass an idyllic night in a garden where they fall madly in love, Hollywood style. So you can imagine Robeldo&apos;s surprise when he drops by the house of his pal Marques De Torre Bianca (Armand Kaliz) and meet&apos;s Bianca&apos;s wife ‚Äì Elena! Next, a seriously ticked off Robeldo attends a dinner party thrown by Parisian banker Fontenoy (Marc MacDermott). It&apos;s a delightful affair until Fontenoy proclaims that he has been bankrupted and ruined by his terrible she-vixen of a mistress ‚Äì Elena!\n\nNow a super seriously ticked off Robeldo, disgusted by Elena (yet still secretly lustful) blows town and returns to the Argentine where he works as a brilliant engineer on a mega-dam building project. But wouldn&apos;t ya know it ‚Äì Elena trails him to the Argentine and sets about destroying every man in sight. Canterac (Lionel Barrymore) &amp; Pirovani (Robert Anderson) bicker over her, leading to a tragic shooting. Badman bandito Manos Duras wants her too, and Robeldo has to beat him in a whip fight. When Manos returns to shoot Robeldo he shoots Bianca instead. Then Manos assuages his seriously damaged ego by blowing up the dam and flooding the village. So that&apos;s one suicide, one whip fight, two murders, and a catastrophic dam failure laid at the feet of one temptress. Which brings me full circle to the point that Greta Garbo is The Temptress. You can drive a truck through the holes in this most unlikely plot, but because the temptress in question is the ethereal and beautiful Greta Garbo, it&apos;s still believable. As I was watching this story unfold I was running every actress of the day through my head, trying to think who else could have pulled off this role, and I came up empty. Cause the thing is, and this is important, Elena is pretty much a cipher in this movie. She doesn&apos;t really do anything. She just is. And no other actress I can think could be remotely plausible in provoking suicides, murders, and village floods just by showing up\n\nAs a title card in The Temptress informs us, &quot;God makes men and women make fools.&quot; Being of the gender in question, I happen to think men do a fine job of making fools of themselves ‚Äì but I digress. Simply put, Elena is beautiful and elegant and tragic. She&apos;s not a Theda Bara kind of vamp, nor a Mary Pickford kind of innocent, but rather some weird blend of the two. Her eyes may be mysterious pools in which men drown, but as Ringo Starr said, &quot;It&apos;s just me face.&quot; In the ultimate showdown between Elena and Robeldo, she tells him that men desire her &quot;Not for my happiness, but for theirs.&quot; Yes, Elena is painfully aware of the destructive effect she has, and so, after Robeldo finally submits to his love for her, she steals away in the night. Get it ‚Äì she sacrifices her happiness for his. Elena and Robeldo do meet again, many years later in the streets of Paris. Elena is broken, shabby and homeless. She pretends to not know him and sacrifices yet again. In 1926, this ending was way too harsh for MGM studio execs. An alternate happier ending was supplied and theater owners were offered the choice of ending to screen, depending on audience tastes. Turns out American cinemas mostly went for the upbeat end to the tale, while European audiences were just fine with doom and gloom. Which pretty much confirms everything we know about the divergent developments of US and European cinema.\n\nIn short, The Temptress is a pretty okay movie, but starring an amazing icon of silent (and beyond) cinema. Greta Garbo alone is worth the price of admission, though Fred Niblo brings solid direction to the table too. There&apos;s little that&apos;s innovative in the presentation, but the Fontenoy suicide party does feature a remarkable shot of the overlong party table that elegant demonstrates the excess and debauchery that broke the man. It&apos;s followed up by an equally remarkable examination of the seedy sexual underbelly of the party, demonstrated by multiple examples of under-table footsy. As a matter of fact, the Parisian scenes ‚Äì the masquerade, the dinner party ‚Äì are far more visually arresting, but far briefer as well, than the Argentine sequences.",

      "reviewBody": "EAST OF BORNEO (Universal, 1931), produced and directed by George Melford, is a rarely seen and revived jungle-setting adventure starring Rose Hobart in a rare leading performance, with Charles Bickford, Georges Renavent, Lupita Tovar and Noble Johnson as the only other listed named actors appearing in the casting credits. \n\nTaken from a story by Dale Van Every, which plays liken a weekly chaptered adventure serial, the narrative opens with Linda Randolph (Rose Hobart), a young woman on board ship, traveling 6,000 miles to Borneo where she has traced her husband, Alan Randolph, whom she&apos;s been searching for nearly three years. With the information given her by the commissioner, Hans Von Blune, she learns her husband is now known to all as Doctor Alan Clark, who can now be found in Marado, some 300 miles inland East of Borneo. After a long and treacherous journey accompanied by native guides through the dangerous jungles consisting of pythons, tigers and pumas, Linda finally finds Alan (Charles Bickford), now a court physician in the palace located near a volcano, and house guest of Prince Hashin (Georges Renavent), who earlier had saved the drunken derelict doctor&apos;s life. Now good friends, aside from his boozing up liquor from time to time, Alan entertains the Prince with a game of checkers. Things begin to change when Linda and Alan come face to face, with Linda, stunned by Alan&apos;s drunken presence. In spite of how she&apos;s being treated, she still loves him and wants nothing more than to have him return home with her. Through plot development, it is learned that through their one year of marriage, Alan&apos;s medical experiments have kept him away from Linda, and because of her involvement with another man )Harry), whom she never loved, Alan accuses her of infidelity and leaves her. Alan is then told by Linda she never got the divorce and they are still legally married. Though Alan refuses her love and insists she leave, Linda finds herself forced to remain by orders of the Prince, for sinister reasons of his own.\n\nWhile 1931 brought forth Universal horror classics as DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN, many of their other theatrical releases from that year are virtually forgotten. EAST OF BORNEO, a lesser known product, may not be a horror film, but it does contain some chills of its own. Released a year before the classic THE MOST DANGEOUS GAME (RKO, 1932), EAST OF BORNEO does contain a villainous-host, that of Prince Hashin, who pleasures himself in watching guilty natives being fed to the crocodiles as one swims for his life to safety across the bank, only to meet with more hungry crocodiles on the other side. The Prince even intends on doing the same to his doctor friend after Alan&apos;s attempts to sneak Linda off the island at night. Georges Renavent, who makes one think about the bearded Cesar Romero from WEE WILLIE WINKIE (1937), gives a notable performance. Lupita Tovar as Nieia, a native girl on the island who has a passion for the doctor, is visible in certain scenes, but sadly given very little to do or say throughout its full 75 minutes.\n\nThough EAST OF BORNEO gets off to a very slow start, it does pick up considerably during its second half, even if some of the results are unbelievable at times. Unseen for many years, EAST OF BORNEO did have occasional broadcasts during the early years of cable television, such as Christian Broadcast Network in the early 1980s. Because it&apos;s a public domain title, prints have become available through various distributors since then on both video cassette and later DVD format. Aside from earthquake and volcano eruptions that occur in the story, EAST OF BORNEO may not offer any great shakes to contemporary viewers. Overall, for classic film buffs, it&apos;s still curiosity viewing if nothing else. (**)",

The scenery is beautiful and refreshing.  Most older children will probably love it, but there is mild violence and younger children might be frightened.\n\nAt times the plot moves slowly, but doesn&apos;t get overly boring for the adults.  Not a bad picture overall.",

Vincent Zhao is the titular hero, who after rescuing a kidnapped prince, returns home to his wife Ying (Zhou Xun) and young son, rather than becoming a governor as the prince offers in reward for his service. Instead, he hands the governorship over to his foster brother Yuan (Andy On), thinking to share his good fortune with the man he thinks of as a brother and who is in fact Ying&apos;s actual brother. He doesn&apos;t realize that Yuan is full of hatred and vengeful feelings for Su&apos;s family, because Su&apos;s father had killed Yuan&apos;s real father many years earlier, to prevent that rampaging man from killing more innocent people. Five years later, Yuan has control of an army, and he is seeking vengeance....\n\nThat is only the opening section of this film, directed by Yuen Woo-Ping, who is best known in the West for choreographing the fight scenes in &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot; &quot;True Legend&quot; is full of fight scenes, some of the quite funny, some of them quite beautiful; and it is also full of cameos of kung fu superstars such as Gordon Liu, Michelle Yeoh and, in his last role, David Carradine. I find that a little kung fu fighting goes a long way, but if you&apos;re going to see a kung fu film, you couldn&apos;t find better than this."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Plop &amp; De Kabouterschat&apos; is a Family film from 1999, made by Studio 100. In 2008 a completely &apos;remastered&apos; version was released with new special effects and a completely new soundtrack. My review is about that version.\n\nThe film starts with the four gnome friends who are in Kabouter Plop&apos;s house, keeping a spring cleaning. During the cleaning, Klus suddenly finds a treasure map in the chimney. That treasure map was made by his Uncle Mop. The gnomes go straight away to find this treasure, because they are naturally very curious if there is anything of value in it. But the search is certainly not easy. The gnomes must pass 3 dangerous obstacles. First they have to cross a creepy bridge through a scary swamp, then they have to go through the forest of a thousand birds and finally they have to go through a cave that is about to collapse. If that is still not enough, two other gnomes also find the treasure map that Kabouter Klus had lost along the way. They are now also looking for the treasure..\n\nI have watched this movie many times in my youth so I was really looking forward to reviewing it again. I have to say he was certainly not disappointing. He was just as good and as fun as I can remember. And of course the forests could be expanded a bit more so that there wasn&apos;t only a light screen in the background, but that was actually my only annoyance. I think children don&apos;t even think about that. I know I didn&apos;t when I was younger. The story is very simple and easy so you can keep follow it easily. The film is certainly not too scary for small children. The soundtrack is also really great, as always with Studio 100 films. They have ensured that the scene in the swamp, for example, was not made too scary, but just exciting for the children. Just when I thought the music was going to get a kind of horror sound, it became a little less. Very well done. The special effects were also very good. I found the &apos;giant human road&apos; very beautiful and just seemed real, the flies at the swamp that were flying around and the moment the cave collapsed were also impressive. I only mention a few moments here. All special effects were beautiful, although I think the scene with the birds could have been better made a lot better with the budget that they had.\n\nIn short, I enjoyed this movie very much and I will definitely watch it more often. I recommend to everyone who loves Studio 100 or gnomes to watch this movie. No matter what age. Studio 100 has no age limit. If your heart continues to shine from this like mine, definitely go check this out!!",

Matthew Carriere gives an unblemished and heartfelt performance as an innocent caught behind the barbed wire walls of his very soul and the duty to which he has been placed. A must-see for everyone and an advocacy for pacificism. This was Volker Schloendorff&apos;s first film, and by admission one of Barbara Steele&apos;s favorite roles.",

The Spanish title &quot;Brandy&quot; is the nickname given to the flawed protagonist who will be given the responsibility of ridding Tombstone of its greedy and evil oligarchs led by George Rigaud (frequent villain in Spanish films of the 50s). It was Jose Luis Borau&apos;s first feature, graduate and young teacher at the newly established National Film School. It was commissioned by Antonio Manzanos from a story by Jose Mallorqui, who were both involved in the 50s popular western adventures of &quot;El Coyote&quot;, although it underlines one of Borau&apos;s repeated motifs in his subsequent filmography, the importance of solidarity.",

      "reviewBody": "The enjoyment that you derive out of this movie is directly proportional to what your expectations are. I&apos;m a big fan of Honda&apos;s work, he&apos;s made some of the very best giant monster (not just limited to Japanese kaiju) movies ever made - this is not one of them. It&apos;s really pretty bad - not Jun Fukuda bad, mind you, but in the world of Ishiro Honda&apos;s works it&apos;s quite the stinker.\n\nAnd yet... It&apos;s somehow great. What makes it truly great can essentially be summed up in one word. Gezora. Gezora is a giant squid, or an octopus, or perhaps a cuttlefish, or... It really doesn&apos;t matter what Gezora is supposed to be, just know that (unlike the giant octopus from &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;) Gezora is not a slimy creature that flutters and unfurls itself along the ground like an octopus probably would if it could actually move outside of the water. No, my friends, Gezora is rubbery looking and he walks. Let&apos;s say that again so that the utter ridiculousness of it can sink in:\n\nGezora WALKS. On tentacles. \n\nYou see, they didn&apos;t have access to high-tech animatronics and kaiju films have always had an aversion to stop-motion animation, so, as was custom - it&apos;s a guy in a suit. But how does a guy in a suit impersonate the flowing movement of an octopus/squid/cuttlefish on land, you ask?\n\nHe doesn&apos;t. He walks around, dragging and swinging tentacles with reckless abandon. That, if for no other reason, is why this movie must be seen to be appreciated. Gezora is, by far, my favorite bad kaiju. Yes, even better and far more ridiculous than King Seesar. This may be difficult to believe, but he&apos;s even sillier (and more lovable) than Guiron - knife-headed foe of Gamera. You, too, will love Gezora if you just give him a chance - and that chance has arrived as of today, for &quot;Space Amoeba&quot; has been released on DVD.\n\nHuzzah!",

Some of the camera work is quite astonishing.\n\nDestivelle is not alone on each mountain: each peak is tackled with companion, a different person from each stage of her life. These scenes are not too forced, and seem to have been unscripted.\n\nI recommend this title for the photography, if nothing else. And at 80 minutes, it&apos;s quite short, which is probably about right for a documentary.",

I think that Gregg Bishop really has an amazing talent and I&apos;m hoping for more from him and his crew in the future and will go back and check out the ones I&apos;ve missed.\n\nYou can tell at times that this was a low-budget flick and pretty indie, but had a good story line and really had you rooting for these kids all the way through. Of course the classic &quot;ready for war&quot; walk down the hall is always a great addition and there were some great lines.\n\nThere were issues with editing that I caught all along, but the director was also the editor and producer and I&apos;m quite sure had his hands full, maybe having someone a little more removed would be helpful, but budget is budget :).

      "reviewBody": "No doubt Roman Polansky knows how to build a gripping movie, with craft and wit, in this case a political thriller, where references to Blair and Bush are no so much explicit, but subtle enough to be perceived somehow. Reviews underlined a style resembling Hitchcock: indeed, the story proceeds, creating suspense, thrill, without appealing to excessive action or shock, although never reaching Hitchcock&apos;s subtlety of insight and mystery, both in characters and situations. Mostly, the plot proves some loose ends as the craftily prepared intrigue seems to come to a hasty ending, leading to a finale which does not appear up to the great potential and high expectations of its previous development.\n\nConvincing and well-focused performances by the whole cast, especially by Ewan McGregor who keeps a high-level performance, never abusing his intriguing role, but thoroughly contained, Pierce Brosnan proves good in his part, although his past stereotyped roles make it difficult to see him credible as a former prime minister, Olivia Williams as his wife Ruth delivers a smart and talented performance. Quite interesting are some minor characters, such as the members of the service, or the old man living on the island, who enhance, despite or probably thanks to their more silent presence, the mysterious atmosphere of the story.",

I first court this film on late night tv in the uk back when channel 5 used to do there late night films that were always guaranteed to be a terrible movie and had the wonderful pleasure to rewatch the film found on YouTube, this is a little bit of a guilty pleasure.

      "name": "&quot;Lawnmower Man 2&quot;- A few competent scenes and a whole lotta unintentional laughs make it a fun one-time watch for fans of trashy b-movies.  All else need not apply.",
      "reviewBody": "Pretty much a permanent fixture on IMDb&apos;s Bottom 100 list, 1996&apos;s &quot;Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace&quot; is not only widely considered one of the worst sequels ever made... it&apos;s widely considered one of the worst films ever made period. While the second claim might be somewhat debatable in retrospect (oh, it&apos;s bad... it&apos;s really bad, but maybe not &quot;worst of all time bad&quot;), the former is most certainly a given. The original film is a wildly dated but mostly harmless sci-fi thriller about a mentally-challenged man who is granted superhuman intelligence and abilities through the power of virtual reality, sending him spiraling on a path towards an evil plot for world domination. It&apos;s forgettable save for its cheesy early-CG effects and a few decent performances by future star Pierce Brosnan and the titular Lawnmower Man Jobe played by Jeff Fahey. It&apos;s a mediocre film, but it hit it fairly big at the box office, so a sequel was pretty much guaranteed.\n\nWhat people couldn&apos;t have predicted, however, is just how incredibly insane the follow-up would be. &quot;Lawnmower Man 2&quot; is frankly bizarre, and never anything less than over-the-top from scene to scene. Story goes the studio-suits behind this mess were hoping to spin the series off into a teen-aimed superhero movie franchise set in cyberspace (a far cry from the more deliberate and slow-burn thriller the original was), and this film would be sort-of a stepping stone in that direction. Add to that woeful miscasting of pretty much every lead character, a lot of nonsensical ret-con work that frequently butchers the storyline of the first film and post-production problems including the director being locked out of the editing room... and you pretty much have a recipe for disaster.\n\nSix years after the events of the first film in a now post- apocalyptic world right out of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (I guess?), Jobe (now played by Max Headroom himself, Matt Frewer) has been discovered and brought back from the brink of death by an evil megalomaniacal VR tycoon, who needs him to perfect the film&apos;s MacGuffin- the &quot;Chiron Chip&quot;... the most powerful computer chip ever conceived. After re-discovering his old friend Peter Parkette (Austin O&apos;Brien) in virtual reality, Jobe goes on a quest to track down the creator of VR, Dr. Trace (Patrick Bergin), who has key information that will assist in Jobe taking control of the Chiron Chip... or something stupid like that. Blah, blah, blah... Jobe goes power-crazy yet again and tries to take over the world with the Chiron Chip. Chiron Chip, Chiron Chip... Chiron Chip. You&apos;ll be sick of that combination of words by the time the film&apos;s over. They say it constantly.\n\nBasically, the film is a weird mixed-drink from Satan&apos;s tavern... one part &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, one part &quot;Super Mario Bros. The Movie&quot;, one part &quot;Tron&quot;, one-half part the original &quot;Lawnmower Man&quot;... topped off with five parts &quot;Highlander 2: The Quickening.&quot; Garnish with overacting. Serve over ice from Flint, Michigan.\n\nEverything is a fundamental mess. The storyline is nonsensical and completely unclear, with the main focus being on delivering constant techno-babble as often as possible while punctuating every few scenes with an explosion or bizarro murder-sequence as Jobe picks off various targets, though sanitized for a PG-13 rating. As mentioned above, the film&apos;s MacGuffin of choice is the &quot;Chiron Chip&quot;, though the Chip itself is poorly established and doesn&apos;t seem to amount to all that much in the story. There&apos;s also some genuinely laughable mis-judgments on the part of the filmmakers to try and gear the film towards children as per studio request... so you get uproarious scenes where the &quot;Information Superhighway&quot; is personified as an actual highway in cyberspace that our heroes get into a car-chase on. I could not stop laughing. Everyone in the cast mugs for the camera in such a way that you cringe so much that you can&apos;t help but giggle, with special props going to Frewer, who turns the quiet and sinister Jobe from the first-film into a cackling Jim Carrey wannabe who spouts one- liners at the top of his lungs in every scene. The editing is an absolute mess, with not a single moment given more than an instance of breathing room before it rockets to the next scene... probably because producers oh-so-needed it to appeal to the kids with their &quot;Mtv&apos;s and their Nintendo&apos;s and whatever kids these days like.&quot; And the effects sucked, plain and simple. Not only were they poor in comparison to other films released around the time... they&apos;re somehow objectively worse than the effects in the original four years earlier!\n\nYet... I don&apos;t totally hate the film, and I even do have a mild recommendation for it. It&apos;s awful. Dreadful. But also kinda entertaining. Fans of trashy B-movies and bad cinema will probably get a kick out of it, much as I did. It&apos;s worth watching once for those crowds. I know I couldn&apos;t stop laughing at it. It&apos;s just so baffling and mind-numbing, that even as you feel your braincells depleting... you might get some serious chuckles thanks to it. Also, I can&apos;t help but comment... there is an occasional hint at brilliance here and there. You get the feeling that director/co- writer Farhad Mann was really trying his hardest, and there are a few scenes that are competently filmed and directed. I think there&apos;s a significantly better film somewhere beneath the surface that you glean the occasional look at here. Not a good film... but a better film. It&apos;d be interesting to see what his original vision was.\n\nBut really, aside from bad-movie buffs, I cannot in good conscience recommend &quot;Lawnmower Man 2&quot; to anyone. It&apos;s terrible. Strange. And wildly confusing. And it is easily and indisputably one of the worst sequels ever made, earning a much-deserved 1 out of 10 for me.",

This semi-documentary film shows female bodybuilders in 1985, and it critiques the performance they must all put on in order to make it in their business (hence the loaded make-up: first of all it was the eighties, second of all they had to struggle to remain feminine looking or, as seen with Bev Francis, they were penalized).  Watching this film should enrage you since it&apos;s clear who SHOULD win the title.  Clearly the judges need a little updating, but again, it was1985.\n\n I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it.  It critiques female bodybuilding and questions the stereotypical view of women as seen through the actions of the judges."

I&apos;m a drummer, and was working with the Very Special Jazz Band, the group responsible for producing an Artie Shaw &quot;Celebration&quot; concert shortly before the release of this documentary. Artie came out of retirement, came up to Ventura and rehearsed the band for an entire afternoon, while the production crew captured it all. I doubt if anyone who participated got the opportunity to see this before it got tied up in the courts. With Artie no longer with us, I was hoping for a quick resolution. Sincerely, Rick Horne"

You gotta love the way these Italian stunt men spin around when they are shot. Some of them even got their horses doing it! Only one man refuses to join Gordon&apos;s gang: a clean cut dandy who calls himself Arizona Colt, after the state and the pistol.\n\nThis is not your usual Spaghetti Western. The man with no name never cared about his appearance. Arizona however, hides in his underwear, hanging upside down from a tree to take another outlaw&apos;s outfit, all to keep his precious suit clean! The score is also more American in nature than usual: very brassy and with the occasional comic banjo thrown in for good measure.\n\nColt is off to Blackstone Hill where we are introduced to a lot of supporting characters that have little to add to the picture. Dolores, who work in a bar full of men, is killed by a drunk in the barn before the audience gets a change to care about her. When her father asks Arizona to go after the killer, he not only demands money in return but the other daughter, Jane too (so he isn&apos;t a total fruitcake after all). Jane does not object either, since this is the only guy in town who knows what a bathtub looks like. He&apos;s so clean his teeth shine in the dark.\n\nIt gets even sillier when the Scorpion gang stumbles upon a gang of singing cowboys. The scene starts of quite amusing, with Gordon&apos;s right hand man Big Whiskey smelling out each person&apos;s valuables. But when the gang leader pulls out his golden pocket watch (don&apos;t they always?) and starts shooting all of these Gene Autry&apos;s in the back, Whiskey is not amused. He eventually teams up with Arizona, who has failed his mission in order to learn the usual lesion in humility. \n\nWhile he is recuperating in an abandoned church, Jane comes begging for his help again. It seems Gordon is now holding the entire town hostage. Luckily Whiskey is an explosives expert and the two of them decide to take on all the Scorpions. Ever the showoff, Arizona kills each one of them in a different way, making use of household objects like rocking chairs and of course his acrobatics. In the sequel, &quot;Arizona si scaten√≤... e li fece fuori tutti&quot; (1970), the much dirtier Anthony Steffen took over the lead from Giuliano Gemma.\n\n5 out of 10"

The insertion of well known actors was ridiculous and were obviously just stuck in to get people to come see it, but the writing was so bad that even the good actors were bad. Maybe if the director listed wasn&apos;t dead while filming it might have turned out better. I think that it was a good idea, just not well thought out.

      "reviewBody": "Everything takes place in the times of Felipe II when he begins to lose all the lands conquered by his father Carlos I. While King Felipe II (1559-1598) agonizes in the shadow of his lost splendor, a man, defying divine designs and human justice, turns his passions into destiny and his will into law. Don Juan shows up before this panorama, a man who will see his wishes fulfilled .This Don Juan, masterfully interpreted by Fernando Guillen (a Goya winner), is an already mature man who desperately tries to enjoy the moment, and when he has succeeded, he finds that it is like water slipping through his fingers, making it impossible for him to stop that instant. His fame is as great as his pride and ambition . His damnation, eternal. His name, a legend: Don Juan. This a free adaptation based on Moli√©re&apos;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;.\n\nDrama with historical and tragic elements ; including enjoyable performances and adequate set design. The first impression that this interesting and outlandish film gives me is that we are looking at a precious and luxurious work with unusual dialogues , in which philosophy and thought-provoking sentences abound. The moralistic story of Don Juan is revised by Gonzalo Suarez, an admirer of Igmar Bergman&apos;s cinema, trying to bring to life a new epic adventure about the destiny of man. The atypical director, if he has an offbeat career, as he&apos;s a peculiar Spanish filmmaker, a novelist turned filmmaker who reached his creative maturity with &quot;Paddling in the Wind&quot; or &quot;Rowing with the wind&quot; and here he suggests a personal reflection on the figure of Don Juan, but ignoring the works of Tirso de Molina and Zorrilla, in his opinion too romantic, to get closer to Moli√®re&apos;s version.\n\nThe title of the film belongs to a poem by Baudelaire: &quot;The flowers of evil&quot;. His conquests in the bedroom hardly have any importance, the figure of Don Juan will persist as long as the concept of seducing subsists in man beyond love, while linking with the main characteristic of the literary figure . Suarez portrays him with sympathy, it is undeniable that the director shares the capacity for rebellion against that society that rejects his philosophy. Stars Fernando Guill√©n giving a fine acting as the seducer Don Juan , along with Mario Pardo as his assistant Esganarel . And a plethora of familiar secondaries , such as : Charo L√≥pez as Do√±a Elvira , H√©ctor Alterio , Ana √Ålvarez, Manuel de Blas, I√±aki Aierra, Yelena Samarina , Ayanta Barilli, Alicia S√°nchez, Joan Potau and Cayetana Guill√©n Cuervo , Fernando Guill√©n&apos;s daughter.\n\nFrom a personal and surreal iconography, the filmmaker modifies the age of the libertine and shows us an aging seducer, how decadence makes an appearance, and death inevitably approaches him: &quot;I have faith that death is a woman&quot; , displaying some attractive frames at the end , when Don Juan is transported on the boat by Caronte through the lagoon Estigia . Another important detail introduced by the Asturian director has been to place the story in the time of Felipe II, I√±aki Aierra incorporates with absolute conviction a ruler who in some way is the counterpoint of the figure of Don Juan. If he tries to recover the joy of living, the decrepit monarch, dying like the Spanish empire, intends to abolish laughter forever.\n\nIt contains an evocative and emotive musical score by Alejandro Masso . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Carlos Suarez , brother&apos;s director , being filmed on marvelous landscapes with filming locations from El Escorial, Madrid, Segovia, Castilla y Le√≥n, Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Sanabria, Zamora, Castilla y Le√≥n , Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha, Cuenca, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain . The photography is delicate and captivating, as are the costumes and art direction. Direction by Gonzalo Suarez is pretty good , he shows his skill for edition , displaying agreeable dramatic tension and realizing long shots with surrealist images and competently realized . Gonzalo Suarez is a good craftsman who has directed several films from the 60s . He excelled at bringing to life tautly written tales about strange characters facing difficult circumstances and dealing with thought-provoking , brooding stories . Throughout his career he regularly alternated hits with misses . He has stylistic trademarks , but also been criticized for his slow-moving films , though his best flicks remain exciting to watch . Among his most important pictures , mostly dramas , are the following ones : 1994 The detective and death , 1992 La Reina An√≥nima , 1991 Don Juan en Infiernos ,1988 Rowing with the wind , 1984 Ep√≠logo ,1977 Parranda , 1977 Reina Zanahoria , 1976 Beatriz , 1975 La Regenta , 1974 La Loba y la Paloma . Rating : 6/10 . Decent rendition about Don Juan myth ..",

Gert Fr√∂be as a professional wrestler, fixed results, faked injuries and all is a sight to be treasured. The connection to the main plot is slim - Gert shows the teacher a few moves for self-defense, and one night the rebellious youth abandons a planned physical attack when our teacher is accompanied by some of these silverbacks.",

Lana Clarkson is lovely as usual and yes there are plenty of topless shots, but what set this b-grade sword and sorcery tale apart is the other actors. Rodger Cudney is a great villain as always and somehow manages to maintain his dignity no matter how awful the situation. Greg Wrangler does a nice job as the conflicted love interest and best of all is the young Cecilia Twerina as the evil little Tamis. Who the heck let a kid on this picture? Who cares? she&apos;s great.\n\nThe plot is simply, Athalia&apos;s father, the king, may be dead and the evil Ankaris wants the throne, but needs the magical scepter to hold it. For some reason, never really explained, Hofrax (Cudney) is helping him. Tamis is Ankaris&apos;s wicked daughter. OK, the budget is obviously low, but the film doesn&apos;t look that bad and the performers appear to be trying. Note the convenient barrel of water that spills off the back of the wagon so Althalia and a barbarian babe can mud wrestle!! the fights aren&apos;t too badly staged and the plotting is pretty decent. Chris Young tries hard to convey a sense of epic with the music.\n\nAthalia refuses to divulge the secret, in case her Father is still alive, and gets tortured by Hofrax and Tamis!! All together for the rack sequence and spider bite-ewww! Orian (Wrangler) rescues Athalia nd together they unite, literally and then the King&apos;s warrior&apos;s return and it&apos;s off to strike for justice! I won&apos;t reveal the fate of Ankaris and Tamis, but it is rather moving.\n\nAll in all this is a good b-movie with attractive performers and plenty of fun for all.",

      "reviewBody": "I thought this movie had a real intriguing premise, all squandered in a tepid third act. Sam (Mischa Barton) is a freshly graduated demolitions expert, sent on her first job by her family&apos;s business. The building she is sent to scout is in the middle of nowhere, constructed by some mad architect a la Thirteen Ghosts. 16 people were &quot;walled in,&quot; buried alive with concrete inside the structure of the building. When Sam arrives, there are still some people living there!\n\nIt is implied that the building holds many secrets (maybe that was unintentional), most of which go unexplored. We have ONE secret passageway, level 8 is &quot;off limits,&quot; being the architect&apos;s floor, and, well, a dump. It all looked promising, anyway. Walled In goes completely off the rails at about the 55-minute mark, where it simply becomes a story about obsession. Ok, am I to seriously believe &quot;Jimmy&quot; is capable of pulling off any of these schemes, other than, say, lying or killing his dog? Also, when they show the demolition team drilling, there are more bodies! Why would the police stop looking, and order the crime scene destroyed? A swing and a miss. I&apos;m giving this 5 stars for drawing me in.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m rather pleasantly surprised after seeing Ghost Ship¬ÖI expected it to be a lot sillier, more dumb and inferior than it actually is. Still a long way from being a good horror film but a step in the right direction, to say the least. Cast and crew paid attention to building up a horrifying atmosphere instead of attacking the audience with lame and violent killing scenes. That&apos;s an effort that gets my appreciation. The vicious opening sequence is professional horror¬Ö a scene that grabs you by the throat and demands your complete attention and curiosity for the rest of the movie. The high quality level is held up a little while longer but unfortunately it loses his grip during the second half. For as long as the mysterious, deserted ship is portrayed as a complete riddle, the film is fascinating, interesting and beautifully shot. As soon as a few plot-aspects are clarified, Ghost Ship turns into a mediocre and predictable thriller¬ÖI&apos;m convinced that, with a slightly more intelligent script, this could have become one of the better horror-thrillers since the new Millennium. Now, it&apos;s only regarded as a reasonable and decent effort that lacks a bit of talent. Nonetheless, the settings and decors make it worth watching. The graphic decorations aren&apos;t overused, so it remains a beautiful experience to observe at least once. Gabriel Byrne is acting far below his normal standards and yet he&apos;s still great! All the other cast-members are pretty uninspired and forgettable. I&apos;d describe Ghost Ship as a nice waste of time. If you have the opportunity, I advise you to search for an 80&apos;s horror title called `Death Ship&apos;¬Öa terrific piece of trash of which Ghost Ship borrowed a lot of ideas.",

Well, you&apos;ll find it here, albeit with sub-par results.\n\nWhile the actual fighting in the film is all right (though I&apos;ve seen better), some of the dialogue and characterizations need re-editing. The acting ranges from passable to &apos;William Shatner&apos; (especially from the Klan leader - the guy with the goatee). The plot for BOTB3 is shaky - you can easily predict what the racists are going to do next and what the hero is going to do about it. The climax can be described as similar to the average horror/chop-sockey movie: not quite believeable (how can one guy take on 50 (or so) villains - with guns no less?) and devoid of thrills. Oh yeah, that Owen kid (the troubled teen who joins the racist gang) is heavily involved in the climax, and EVERYONE who watches this movie will be able to guess what he does at the end, even if they turn it off half-way.\n\nThis film is kind of like an episode of &apos;Walker, Texas Ranger&apos; - tame, predictable, and really not worth bothering with, since there are so many better choices available in your video store."

      "reviewBody": "What makes this tepidly received 1953 romantic melodrama with music watchable in the 21st century is primarily Joan Crawford who, by this time, was at the zenith of her screen acting powers. In the 1950s she played a succession of formidable middle-aged dames who had maintained their good looks despite years of character-building hard knocks. But at the core of all of these creatures was a tender and easily broken heart and the plots of most of Joan&apos;s 1950s films explore the way this tender heart is exposed through love.\n\nSecond in appeal is the color scheme. It was not unusual for 1950s Hollywood commercial fare to feature brilliant, even garish, colors in order to entice viewers away from the little boxes of black-and-white in their living rooms. Seen through the lens of more than half a century, these schemes look bizarre, even ridiculous, but create their own fascination. This is one of those super-saturated works that can hold the attention just to see which crazy color combination will appear in the next scene.",

It is an impressive and colorful story about the importance of love and places where it develops as truth.",

      "reviewBody": "Pierre Lachenay (Jean Desailly) is a successful writer. He is leaving Paris for Lisbon to give a conference on &quot;Balzac et l&apos;argent&quot;. On the flight to Lisbon he feels instant attraction for a beautiful flight stewardess. In Lisbon he&apos;ll discover that he&apos;s staying at the same hotel as her. Pierre wastes no time and gets to know her. Her name is Nicole (Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac). She is spontaneous and easy-going, but it&apos;s easy to detect the romantic streak in her. They start an affair right there in Lisbon. She gives him her Paris telephone number. He calls her. They meet. In Paris their relationship grows in intensity.\n\nPierre is a married man. His wife is also a good-looking woman and he has a 10-year-old daughter that loves him (as does his wife). Pierre is an intellectual with an organized life, maybe having had some flings here and there, but nothing that really threatened the comfortable foundations of his life. But now he has met Nicole. And Nicole represents everything that Pierre had never really experienced before: she has a real &quot;joie de vivre&quot; but underneath it, there is pain, and above all, strength - the strength to overcome sadness and start all over again, that is, to live right here and now.\n\nPierre, on the other hand, as an intellectual, lives a life of compromises. His wife, Franca (Nelly Benedetti), loves him and has a strong personality. She knows exactly what she wants and is determined to fight for it. Pierre is between two strong women. He loves Nicole - she has opened a new life, a new world for him. Will he follow his heart? And where will his heart lead him? I think that &quot;La Peau Douce&quot; is one of the more personal films made by Truffaut. It has a psychological subtlety not displayed in his later works (be it his later Antoine Doinel films, his literary adaptations, or his homages - to Hitchcock, Jean Renoir etc..). Never again would Truffaut reach the depth of &quot;La Peau Douce&quot;.\n\n&quot;La Peau Douce&quot; reveals understanding (and tenderness) for all the characters, but alongside these traits there&apos;s also a bitter irony and even some touches of dark comedy. The characters are shown in all their weaknesses and beauty. In later Truffaut films the tenderness would be the prevailing feature - the irony would come along in a watered-down form.",

I watched it when it first came out and then again just last night.  I can&apos;t help it but Chow Yun-fat is definitely the Sean Connery of our eastern brothers.\n\nI will admit that this movie is not for everyone.  Then again, you can&apos;t make everyone happy all of the time. You can make some people happy some of the time.  This movie made it&apos;s money&apos;s worth, so apparently it made most people happy most of the time."

      "reviewBody": "While I have seen more classic Hollywood movies than most anyone alive, I have only come to watch any of the Lassie films recently. I had assumed they&apos;d be schmaltzy messes...and, apparently, I was wrong. After thoroughly enjoying the first film, &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;, I decided to try another Lassie film, &quot;Hills of Home&quot;...the fourth Lassie film. With seven in all, I still have five more MGM Lassie pictures to go.\n\nThis story has nothing to do with the previous Lassie stories. Oddly, this one finds Lassie as a damaged doggy, as his new master abuses the dog because it is a lousy sheepdog and won&apos;t go in the water if needed. Soon the kindly local doctor (Edmund Gwen) buys the dog and the rest of the film is mostly about his life in rural 19th century Scotland tending to the sick and dying...with Lassie as his constant companion and helper.\n\nLike the first Lassie film, this one has a lot of polish and was made in Technicolor. It also features fine supporting actors in many of the leading roles--giving these wonderful actors a chance to shine. In fact, several were from the first Lassie film as well-- Gwen, Donald Crisp and Rhys Williams. Additional actors rounding out the main cast were Janet Leigh and Tom Drake. All in all, a fine and entertaining film...and one that might be best seen with some Kleenex nearby just in case! If I have any complaints about the picture it&apos;s that just about everyone seems inexplicably angry all the time...which is kinda weird!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Tengers&quot; has been marketed with taglines such as &quot;A Small Adult Comedy with a Big Kid&apos;s Heart,&quot; and &quot;Political Correctness Challenged,&quot; neither of which does the film justice or describes it accurately. Rather, it is an animated black comedy about a very dark subject: violent crime. However, violent crime itself is never treated as an object of humor. Instead, the film deals with the dehumanizing effects of living in a very violent, dangerous place like urban South Africa. Even if you&apos;re not a victim, you&apos;re still affected. Characters respond in very different ways: some try to honor the victims of violent crime, some try to grasp onto anything that will make them feel more valuable or important, and some become criminals themselves. At one point, a character wonders what it would be like to be proud of being from a certain area instead of ashamed of the problems associated with it. Another character nods in agreement, as a theft occurs right outside.\n\nThe stop-motion animation is pretty raw, with characters made out of clay living in a bleak urban landscape, but it suffices for the subject and tone of the film. &quot;Tengers&quot; is decidedly not for children, with a character referring to his region as the &quot;murder capital of the world,&quot; and the film featuring one of the most genuinely shocking moments in any animated movie I have ever seen. But if you&apos;re reading this review at all, you could probably figure out that it&apos;s not for kids. If you&apos;re an adult, and don&apos;t mind unusual animated films with very serious undertones, consider it recommended. The last lines of dialogue are particularly great.",

Here a simple story is told without the usual, clearly identified good and bad characters. We watch a story thread its course and are invited to decide for ourselves who, if anyone, is guilty or innocent. Mahommed, the main character, could easily have been portrayed as the stereotypical Jihadist instead he is depicted as frightened and confused which one would suppose are the normal reactions to the situation he finds himself in. It is set in stark but beautiful environments and one can vividly feel the pain and deprivation which is depicted in a most understated manner. This film is different, it is in a league of its own and will be appreciated by anyone with a mind of their own - essential viewing for those who don&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "For the most part, I enjoyed this film. I was engaged throughout and that&apos;s what you want from a film. However, I found myself frustrated with some of the nonsensical choices of the characters. Hopkins was as brilliant as ever. This Hannibal was a lot more ruthless but just as cunning, perceptive and observant. I really like Julian Moore as an actress but I&apos;m just not sure she was right for this role as a shoe-in for the character of Clarice. I don&apos;t know if it was because I was comparing her to Jodie Foster&apos;s Clarice, but it just felt like two completely different characters. She wasn&apos;t as intellectual, sharp or astute as the original Clarice. She felt a lot more vulnerable than the original Clarice. And she made some questionable decisions throughout the film to say the least. Lastly, WHAT happened to the southern twang in her accent, yes your accent can change over the ten years that passed but there wasn&apos;t even a trace of it!\n\nThis film overall was an interesting, further insight into Hannibal&apos;s character and also the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, and his matured fondness for her. Overall, this film is definitely worth watching with some memorable scenes, but just don&apos;t go into it expecting it to be Silence of the lambs part 2.",

C&apos;mon!&quot; Charlie keeps screaming this like a madman while he beats the bejeezus outta the bikers, and it rocks.

      "reviewBody": "The long wait is over. I am finally able to see the concluding movie to the two-parter series. I enjoyed it a lot. Gantz: perfect Answer is a good concluding movie. Although I wished that Gantz would become a trilogy. Heck, the manga has not yet been finished publishing. It won&apos;t hurt to extend into another movie. But the director has in mind a two-parter series and ends the movie firmly. Anyway, that&apos;s my wishful thinking.\n\nThe story: After the first movie, I started to read the manga. So I know more about Gantz when watching the last movie. I can see the movie is somehow faithful to the manga but points and scenes have been changed or added on. But the main story seems faithful. Answers are not really explained properly as what reviewers said. But I don&apos;t mind that. The action scenes are few but extended. Action fans will have to wait for a while for the first real action scene involving a battle in a train. Unlike the first one, this is not as action-packed but it still delivers the action. This movie packs the thrills and suspense too. As the manga has not yet finished, I could not wait to see how the director ends the movie. Acting is okay, there is still some of the over-the-top crying and screaming. Music is surprisingly epic.\n\nOverall: A good Japanese movie with great action, thrills and music. Although the movie does not deliver in explaining unknown questions like movie-goers expect, this movie does deliver some of the best action not seen in Japanese movies and that should take your mind from the unsaid answers. Good series. Hope there will be more big-budget Japanese movies series. Japan needs more of this kind.",

      "reviewBody": "It starts in Amsterdam with some street scenes then some guy gets killed. Back to Hong Kong and cops raid a slum for drugs. Josephine sings folk songs in a bar and the cop goes with her to her apartment. They get friendly but not too friendly. He leaves and another guy rings her bell, says a name, and leaves. Chan Sing enters and he looks terrible with his receding hair line.\n\nThis movie is a crime movie that is filmed like a documentary. The fights are few and not good. I&apos;ll be generous and rate it just average for the year and genre. Personally, the fast forward button got me through it.\n\nJosephine Siao Fong-Fong was the top female martial arts star of the 1950s and 1960s. That was only one of her many accomplishments. I&apos;ll just add she has over 200 movie credits. Anyone can easily find out more about her amazing life. There is a problem. Finding her movies these days is like hunting unicorns. I have only a handful of her pre-1993 movies. Maybe if I lived in Hong Kong I could find more. That still would be difficult. I have been to Hong Kong. I met many people in today&apos;s movie business. Everyone is oblivious of the golden age of martial arts movies. Those who are at least aware of it don&apos;t care.\n\nMy copy is a digital file that plays on a HDTV as widescreen. It has ¬© 1983 Ocean Shores. Since it is wide screen I suspect a laser disk as the source. (The Hong Kong theatrical release was 1976.) So many of these old movies came to America as Ocean Shores VHS tapes. That format in itself has problems plus poor quality of the source film often made it worse. Yet, in Hong Kong, laser disks were the big thing even before that. The laser disk was a higher quality video format and did not have the sides of the video cropped. Few of these came to America or anywhere else. When I say laser disks were the big thing they were still expensive. Hong Kong has a lot of rich people. I suspect that even today there is mansion in Hong Kong with hundreds of laser disks in the back of a walk in closet. These have some of the best movies of the golden age of martial arts movies in the best possible quality. I just hope if that closet ever gets cleaned out the disks do not get trashed but somehow get into the hands of a fan like me.",

I liked everything about this movie, and the music was superb. Also the actors played a very great role which includes Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Javed Jaffrey, and all the people who were part of the movie. And it surely matches up to its tag line: Don&apos;t worry be happy. Its a very good lesson for people especially Indian people as they get very tensed out really fast and look at the negative side of their lives. This movie teaches us how to tackle these everyday and real-life situations. And behind all that to always be happy as we never know if we will be alive the next day. The overall mood of the movie was not tragic at all, and that&apos;s what I liked especially about it. SRK is my favorite actor but he nowadays only appears in emotional movies so he should also appear in these kinds of movies, and I am telling you I seriously hate tragic movies. Because, you know in India people watch those Ekta Kapoor&apos;s daily soaps which has nothing but mostly tragedy. I say if TV serials and movies are all going to be tragic then there will be no fun. Hats off to this movie and I hope bollywood produces more of these kinds of movies so that watching movie can be fun again.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to agree with Nathan L.Erdel of Muncie,IN, on his user comments, this is indeed a comedy classic. The comedy duo of Abbott and Costello were at the height of their popularity during the late thirties and the forties and their particular style of verbal and slapstick comedy do not wear well with the passage of time and the sophistication of the modern day audiences.  However, this film is the exception, from beginning to end it is almost flawless and provides a constant stream of laughs and thrills that even the viewers of today would be sure to enjoy.  The writers and director and all the cast deserve congratulation for a brilliant effort produced on a low Universal budget. The film harnesses the  particular comedy talents of Bud and Lou perfectly for the first and only time.  Although the success of the film led the duo to try to replicate the style by having them meet more outlandish characters, never again were they able to repeat the heights and they gradually went into decline.  But at least this film is left for us to enjoy and savour. From first to last the action, the thrills and the laughs combine flawlessly.  Bud is the perfect foil to Lou&apos;s slapstick,as always. Lon Chaney,Bela Lugosi and Glen Strange all reprise their roles as The Wolfman,Dracula and Frankenstein to wonderful effect to provide the thrills as they chase the duo endlessly trying to get Lou&apos;s brain transferred into Frankenstein. Abbott and Costello provided some fine verbal comedy scenes in  other early films and these also stand the test of time, but Meet Frankenstein was the only instance when their particular brand of comedy was successfully spread over an entire film.",

The story seemed so obvious and clich√© to me, having grown up decades after the film was released. Of course a family would react poorly when they see the racial difference of their daughter&apos;s chosen husband. But, I underestimated the whole thing.\n\nThe film is more complex, because as it turns out, the family is not actually racist -- at least not in theory. And this film allows theory to meet practice, which may be harder to overcome than they thought. Luckily, they have the advantage of the black man being a world-renowned doctor. Had he just been any old schmuck, the family might not have been as welcoming. It is a whole different story.\n\nThe two things I found most interesting about the film were: one, that the two people most opposed to interracial marriage were both black. That seemed quite the opposite of what you might expect. And two, I found it odd that the biggest problem was supposed to be the racial difference. The 14-year age gap and the fact they wanted to get married after only 10 days of knowing each other was largely ignored. I find that to be the much bigger problem -- how do you commit to a lifetime after only 10 days?",

She was a liberated woman before the rest of the world knew that women needed to be liberated.\n\nBut in Auntie Mame she reached her peak. Mame is so vibrant and alive. She flaunts every one of Mame&apos;s eccentricities without stepping over the line into caricature. She also brings alive Mame&apos;s decency, compassion and tolerance. When I watch it, I almost feel ashamed of myself for being such a stick in the mud.\n\nI enjoyed the musical with Lucille Ball, but all the way through it - I wanted it to be Rosalind Russell playing the part. It takes very little imagination on my part to hear her singing the songs. Rosalind, you are &quot;just sensational&quot; as Mame.",

I find it not dramatically different from other Ingmar Bergman films. The internal dialogue, frank discussions on sex, confusion about one&apos;s place in the universe, brutally harsh judgements of the artist - these were present before Persona, and after. When asked about the film, Bergman said he trusted audiences to form their own conclusions. An answer I found refreshing. I don&apos;t think Bergman, who also wrote the screenplay, was out to create a puzzle that must be &quot;solved&quot;. There&apos;s no gamesmanship.\n\nI admire the film&apos;s aesthetic, the impeccable chemistry between Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson, and its humanity. There&apos;s warmth and comfort in the writing. I go back to the bedroom confessional: Liv Ullmann&apos;s Elisabet, the actress who mysteriously stopped speaking, sitting on the bed; Andersson&apos;s Alma, the nurse charged with Elisabet&apos;s care, at the other end of the room. Alma vividly recalls a sexual experience on the beach, with a couple of voyeurs, salaciously detailing everything, subverting the image Elisabet may have had of her, as a prude. In that scene, the patient, Elisabet, transforms to therapist, and Alma becomes the patient. A rich irony.",

Goya (and us)witness the folly of the Spanish royal court, the murderous sadistic perversion of the Catholic Church, the cruel inhumane madness of the Napoleonic War, along with the sensuality and beauty of life passing. This is the film&apos;s main focus: to let us experience the time and place as if seen through Francisco de Goya&apos;s eyes. As expected of a Milos Forman&apos;s film, the locales, the customs, and the overall production replicates the Spain of the late 18th century and early 19th century with the exactitude of a court painting. The cast is also excellent. As an Inquisitor turned a Napoleon&apos;s officer, Javier Bardem deserves another Oscar nomination. Stellan Skargsdar as usual does a chameleon-like transformation this time into Goya. Natalie Portman elevates herself into a higher realm of acting as the doomed, beautiful Ines. And Randy Quaid steals the screen for a few seconds as the King. Milos Forman again has given us an emotionally- and intellectually-challenging portrait of a dark era and the role of art and artist. Although some of the dramatization is slightly contrived, the film is compelling and moving and its vision lingers as Goya&apos;s art.",

      "reviewBody": "The Lower East Side scene in the 90&apos;s, that consisted of fake beat poets, musicians that usually couldn&apos;t play their instruments, and the junkies and barfly hangers on that thought they were among the most cutting edge scene since Andy Warhol&apos;s Factory, are the ones who created this pretentious film. Unlike the Warhol people, who earned attention from all over the world, the East Village scene existed, unnoticed by anyone outside of their group. But they didn&apos;t care, and &quot;Night Owl&quot; is a perfect example, It was a film that was made exclusively for those people, to impress them, and to include them in their project. it&apos;s a wasted opportunity, because &quot;Night Owl&quot; had potential. But to make it more commercial would have been a sellout. So instead of an erotic and atmospheric film, we get disgusting scenes of vomiting and of a vampire eating raw meat and licking the blood off the bottom of a refrigerator. And instead of atmosphere, we get poor lighting, rendering most of the images just too dark to see. The scenes of New York City are wasted, because so little of it can be seen in the 4x3 cropped picture frame. But at least the director made sure he included all his friends in his film, especially one &quot;Screamin&apos; Rachel,&quot; who gets WAY too much screen time, singing her lousy songs in the wretchedly lit bar, that could just as easily have been someones basement. Someone should have told her that she was appearing in a movie, and stopped her from staring into the camera (which isn&apos;t supposed to be there) for the entire time she is performing. The only good thing about this film, other than a few good camera angles, is John Leguizamo, who is sadly underused in this student film. If only someone with real knowledge of film making could have been involved to stop the director from making bad choices, &quot;Night Owl&quot; could have been a true cult gem in the tradition of &quot;Martin,&quot; or &quot;Fade To Black.&quot; Instead it is merely a curiosity piece to those interested in the NYC underground scene that was going on before the city was reduced to the generic, outdoor shopping center it is today. Sadly, NONE of this artistic edginess exists there today, and most of the people in this film are long gone...with the exception of Leguizamo, who went on to a successful career. The incredible Bluray label &quot;Vinegar Syndrome&quot; has given this thing the restoration treatment, but because the movie is so poorly made...it still looks lousy. There are so many great films that are lost. and deserve to be restored; &quot;Night Owl&quot; was an odd choice for them.",

That said, this was awful.\n\nThe story is rushed, character development is thin to none, and some of the best scenes from the book are missing. Whether or not you agree with Ayn Rand, she understood the beast (in her opinion) very well, and represented the conflict through engaging dialogue in fiction. There is none of that here. \n\nInstead, there is a string of passionate speeches given by the central star but he comes across somewhere between a crazy man on the New York subway, and a poorly edited Anonymous speaker on YouTube. He does not come across as a veritable world leader. There are cameos from various B-list news figureheads, making this appear more a reunion of The Celebrity Apprentice than beautiful fictional story with a timely message.\n\nLike others, I saw it to complete the trilogy, and out of respect for an integrity-based way of doing business that is legitimately threatened today. This movie does not help the cause.",

      "reviewBody": "An interesting film directed by Tim Southam in which a small island known to be the burying place for indigents from New York City becomes the setting of some bizarre deaths as well as some political machinations of a Donald Trump-like billionaire who has bought the island and plans on creating housing for the homeless.  The characters involved with first landing on the island and then discovering this weird killing force are a female policewoman who is looking for a nameless dead child, forgotten to everyone except her, a prisoner who is innocent of a crime but is doing his time by burying people on the island in mass graves, and a man with gobs of money who has bought the island for seemingly altruistic reasons but in reality has purely selfish goals.  The other people on the island die mysteriously with what turns out to be a thinking mass of flies that kills quickly and strips bodies of their flesh and speeds up the decay process twenty-fold. The film suffers from some budgetary concerns as the flies are hardly impressive to see or view.  The script also get somewhat trite near the end with little creative tinkering with a situation seen before in other films.That all withstanding, this was quite an unexpected treasure to see. I sat down thinking I was about to watch some special effect laden film about the rotting dead prancing about, but instead I found the film to be very interesting, claustrophobic, decently acted, and even philosophical. Sure there are some things over-done like the girls playing in the streets and the oddly misplaced rap music, but those are small complaints.  I am not saying the film is great in any way, but it is a thinking horror film that depends on mood and setting and suggestion rather than what can easily be viewed. Malcom McDowell does an outstanding job in his businessman role.  He just oozes with nastiness when he wants to.  Talisa Soto also does a rather good job as a cop.  Don&apos;t brush the film off too quickly nor pay to much mind to the negative reviews.  Certainly if you were expecting a film with mindless rotting corpses coming after you with the promise of lots of blood and guts and got a movie with some thought-provoking material you would be disappointed too?",

      "reviewBody": "Review: I quite enjoyed this film, mainly because of the crazy lady who told load of lies to stay in the hotel but the action scenes wasn&apos;t that great, because of the shoddy camera work. Chow Yun-Fat puts in his usual great performance and the different characters also made it quite enjoyable. Once Chow Yun-Fat&apos;s character, The Killer, falls for the lying, cheating and very deceptive girl, the storyline does get a bit weak but the witty storyline and original concept beforehand, was great. Although the movie is full of subtitles, it&apos;s still easy to follow and the open ending was sad in one way but intriguing in another. Most of the movie is based around a hotel, with a Western backdrop, so the scale of the movie isn&apos;t that big but the ending was still pretty epic. With that aside, everything about this small budget movie worked and I&apos;m slowly becoming a big fan of Chow Yun-Fat. Enjoyable!¬†\n\nRound-Up: This was the first movie directed by Ka-Fai Wait, 54, in 1995 and he has gone on to direct 17 more movies for the Oriental market, which I personally haven&apos;t heard of. Chow Yun- Fat also wrote this movie with the director, and with the production skills of John Woo, it&apos;s not surprising that this project turned out so well.¬†\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/drama/romance/westerns starring Chow Yun-Fat, Cecilia Yip, Ho Chin and Shun Lau. 5/10",

A picaresque plot acts largely as an excuse for deadpan, often hilarious humour. And the leading performances are a delight. Perhaps a Wessi take on the strange Ossis, but a loving one. Sort of Thelma and Louise with a happy ending, (and two dumb men, rather than two sassy women...), and almost equally delectable. \n\nThe plot, what there is of it, rather loses steam by the end, but by then you&apos;re too charmed to worry overmuch. And as this film was the catalyst that sparked off my love affair with the NE of Germany, I can forgive it its occasional longueurs.\n\nSee it and reassess your prejudices about the Germans.",

      "reviewBody": "Before Hugh Grant hit the big-time playing floppy-haired fops in rom-coms, he mostly played floppy haired-fops in costume period dramas; an exception to this was Ken Russell&apos;s The Lair of The White Worm (1988), in which Hugh went against type by playing modern-day floppy-haired fop Lord James D&apos;Ampton, who teams up with archaeologist Angus Flint (played by the new Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi) and B&amp;B owner Mary Trent (Sammi Davis) to defeat a pagan snake-woman (Amanda Donohoe) who worships a giant, ancient, subterranean wyrm (another name for dragon).\n\nThis being a Russell movie, there is plenty of surreal weirdness on offer, with psychedelic dream sequences, Christian-baiting blasphemous imagery, phallic symbolism, and cheap titillation courtesy of Donohoe, who spends a lot of her time naked, and Catherine Oxenberg, who is stripped to her undies as a sacrifice for the creature. However, what could have been extremely controversial actually proves to be rather amusing thanks to the director&apos;s tongue-in-cheek B-movie approach (some might call it &apos;camp&apos;) and the tacky special effects; ultimately, this is silly, harmless fun for the cult movie crowd.\n\n6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for the Concorde dream sequence, which is downright trippy.",

The film questions whether, despite our understandable wish to severely punish the human garbage who commit such evil crimes, revenge might not be the wisest route to take.\n\nSuperb performances, tight direction from Daniel Grou, and some truly disturbing imagery make this film hard to ignore, but it is its highly debatable central theme‚Äîto torture or not to torture‚Äî that makes 7 Days a more powerful viewing experience than many of the &apos;torture&apos; films that we&apos;ve had to endure post-Saw.",

She reveals a real flair for comedy playing the desperate girl who fancies the hero who fancies another girl in the team who fancies the team jock.\n\nThe CGI is excellent. The film flags a bit in the middle but is very different to anything I have seen before and well worth getting. I bought mine from Amazon.",

Kirsten&apos;s acting sucks -- it just sucks in every way possible.  They have no chemistry.\n\n The character of Lidda (Dunst) wasn&apos;t &quot;bad&quot; enough for me -- she wasn&apos;t much of anything, it was like she was reading her lines and had no clue what was going on.  Vincent Kartheiser&apos;s Colonel was just about the only believable character -- I liked Colonel a lot.  But it didn&apos;t help the film much.\n\nI didn&apos;t appreciate the none-too-subtly cloaked symbolism (i.e. the &quot;Second Chance Motel,&quot; the whole movie happening on and around Valentine&apos;s Day). The ending was also stupid -- it&apos;s supposed to be optimistic, a &quot;fresh start,&quot; but PLEASE.  You know she&apos;s going to keep smoking, and he&apos;s going to keep gambling, and they&apos;ll get sick of each other really fast and break up again.  It didn&apos;t convince me.",

Can you imagine Moe as Joe, Curly as Averell and Larry and Shemp as the other brothers. WOW!\n\nWhen I show the DVD to friends I mention that if they like the Stooges, they&apos;ll like this film.\n\nComplaints about the lack of Lucky Luke&apos;s air time is valid, but, of course, this is a film about the Daltons and Luke is just along to keep it interesting.\n\nThe fiesta at El Tarlo&apos;s is wonderfully done and reminiscent of &quot;Three Amigos&quot; but a lot more surreal in nature..\n\nI recommend it as a nice diversion.",

Surprisingly thoughtful, restrained and adept for a B movie, it&apos;s got a tightly wound little story about a human woman (Jillian McWhirter) who is impregnated by extraterrestrials that are tinkering around with our biology for who knows why. Her husband (Arnold &apos;Imhotep&apos; Vosloo) is at a loss and doesn&apos;t know where to turn as her condition gets progressively more¬Ö icky. Help comes in the form of two kindly doctors (Lindsay Crouse and Wilford &apos;Diabeetus&apos; Brimley) and a UFO-ologist played by an unusually laid back Brad Dourif, but will their collective effort be enough to save her life, remove whatever being is in her womb and escape the attention of the aliens for good? Browsing the shelves this looks like a full on schlock-fest based on the cast and general vibe, but it&apos;s something a bit more tasteful that takes itself just seriously enough to separate it from the mass of junk in this arena. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there&apos;s some slick scares and a few gooey wtf moments, but they&apos;re used with a modicum of discretion and as such feel earned, always taking a backseat to the actors who give the human drama weight. Great little forgotten sci-if/horror.",

The plot synopsis, of driving a locomotive from Arkansas to Chicago, seemed too silly and unrealistic, to the point where I wasn&apos;t sure I would enjoy the movie. You know, like Karen Black flying a 747.\n\nFortunately there was a good explanation for how they managed to get the locomotive to Chicago, so I could relax and enjoy some really nice character studies and a fairly decent yarn. The life of folks who live in double-wides was told with a great deal of sympathy and understanding, without being pandering or condescending. Wilford Brimley as the life-long railroad man was particularly well done, as were Barbara Barrie as his wife and Kevin Bacon as a guy with more testosterone than brains.\n\nBut any movie that features both Clint Howard and Rita Jenrette is probably not Oscar material, and neither is a movie with a plot hole in the third act big enough to drive a locomotive through. Still, I&apos;m glad I saw the movie. It doesn&apos;t bother me at all that I&apos;ll never get the time back that I spent watching it.",

      "name": "The film that truly proves what a visual medium film is",
      "reviewBody": "I implore anybody that has seen this movie once, and not liked it, to watch it once more. This time, however, take into account that film is a visual medium. Instead of expecting a narrator or a character to easily explain to you what is happening try paying attention to what is happening. Examine and truly THINK about what is expressed visually. The brilliant part about Under The Skin is how well it tells a story without dialog, without running commentary, and without the central character saying much at all.\n\nThink about the purpose of what the female character is doing. The entire story tells itself so easily if you let it. The problem with the modern movie-goer, and admittedly myself, is that we want things explained to us. We&apos;re happy to be treated like ignorant flatheads that don&apos;t know our butts from our elbows. Look at any other review here on IMDb and pay close attention to what is being criticized. They are mostly the same things over and over again.\n\nThey don&apos;t criticize what is conveyed through the film&apos;s imagery. Instead, they say things like &quot;Not enough was explained.&quot; &quot;This film had no plot.&quot; &quot;The movie went nowhere.&quot; or &quot;Nothing happened.&quot; At the risk of sounding smug, I will say that these people are looking for the wrong things in this movie, or any movie. When going into any new film it&apos;s important to remember the medium you&apos;re choosing to entertain you. It&apos;s not like a book on tape, or music. Movies can explain the plot, story, character motivations, and roles without having to have a character, or narrator explain it to you.\n\nI was one of those people that didn&apos;t &quot;get&quot; this film and gave it an extremely low rating of 1 star. But I decided to change to a 7 after much reflection on the content and thoughts it provoked afterward. After reading over 5 or 6 positive I got curious. Why do so many people think this movie is fantastic and innovative? I implore you to look up the video review by Renegade Cut.\n\nThis one video, in addition to Under The Skin, made me rethink what I think a movie should be. It can be artistic, and different, and entertaining without following the well established formula for modern movies. Personally, I feel like people in general are too harsh. A one star rating should be reserved for terrible films, with nothing to say at all. Well, that&apos;s not this film. It certainly has plenty to say about what it&apos;s like to be an outsider, and what a gift it truly is to be human.\n\nA one star rating should be reserved for the most thoughtless trash in existence. This isn&apos;t even close to that. Was it for me? No, but I certainly &quot;get&quot; it. I get what the message is, and what it was trying to do. That I had to think to myself &quot;What did I just watch?&quot; was enough for a 7 star rating. It made me think, re-evaluate, and wonder. As much as I like Guardians of the Galaxy, or Indiana Jones, I have to ask myself &quot;Did either one of those films make me feel this way?&quot; No, they didn&apos;t.\n\nAnd also, do films necessarily have to be for entertainment? To which I also say no. Films can be about raising a question, or provoking a thought, or experiencing emotions. Maybe the tedium of a scene evokes boredom, but what if that&apos;s the point of the scene being shown? Look past your eyes, think about what the director&apos;s intent was, and I think you&apos;ll enjoy this one way more on a repeat viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "After accidentally knocking her best friend off a roof, Alyce (Jade Dornfeld) is haunted by guilt and delves into a brutal nightmare wonderland of sex, drugs and violence, her mind tearing itself apart along with anyone else who gets in her way.\n\nAs others have mentioned, trying to put this film into any one genre is pretty challenging. The marketers seem to want this to be a ghost story, but that is a very small part of what really happens. Following Alyce&apos;s journey is not horror, but something a little more than drama.\n\nThe attempt to draw from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is strange. Clearly we have &quot;Alyce&quot; and her friend &quot;Carroll Lewis&quot;, which are obvious references. We even have James Duval, who will be known by many as playing a rabbit in &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (though his character here is anything but Alyce&apos;s guide). And there the similarities end.\n\nDirector Jay Lee has moved up in the world from his days (not long ago) making &quot;Zombie Strippers&quot;. Much of this is a &quot;really satisfying slow burn&quot; (in the words of Nikki Hopeman), but has more to offer than just well-paced suspense. Others have made interesting comparisons, with Chuck Bowen labeling it &quot;a blunt, trashy fusion of &apos;Repulsion&apos; and &apos;Bartleby, the Scrivener&apos;.&quot; Brian Tallerico was reminded of &quot;great films like &apos;Repulsion&apos; and &apos;May&apos;&quot;. Unlike these two, I did not see the &quot;Repulsion&quot; connection, but that is a high praise.\n\nBowen says the film &quot;is distinctive because Lee doesn&apos;t invite us to sympathize with Alyce; she isn&apos;t a doomed wallflower in the tradition of the heroes of Carrie, May, or many others&quot;. Quite true -- she is no hero or anti-hero, but merely the protagonist we follow, whether her path is justified or not, sane or insane. And that makes it a stronger film.",

(take THAT Christians!) if we are to evaluate philosophies, perhaps we should judge them on the basis of what they are capable of deconstructing. in which case deconstrution would prove to be the most powerful philosophy, since it is capable of deconstructing just about anything................ that said, &quot;derrida&quot; does not portray the philosopher of deconstruction as an iconoclast. it doesn&apos;t envisage derrida as one of the (Christian, Jew, and Moslem-eating) &quot;lions&quot; of postmodern thought. instead, it presents him as a toothless, aging, declawed, castrated feline mewing by the fireside. a complacent member of the bourgeoisie enjoying his petty privileges. if you watch this film, you might get the idea that deconstruction is a cute, &quot;homey&quot; kind of philosophy designed to reassure the middle classes................"

The best these recent comedy movies I saw would only invoke at best few snicker at time.

I watch both transformer movies and I&apos;m not impressed, not that the CGI is no good but nowsaday I think we are more or less numbed at seeing fanciful explosion and action scene.\n\nGood comedy is hard to come by these days, and this movie come hitting by in the style of Steven chow joke really make my day.\n\nBe forewarned though that it&apos;s best to listen to Cantonese audio for the best effect, in mandarin and the joke&apos;s a bit wash off, just looking at English subtitle then you might as well skip this movie or you will be berating this is a dumb and sleepy movie",

Absolutely to be seen, however, I repeat, not by everyone, but only by real and very intelligent moviegoers. No, it&apos;s not a thriller, as someone else wrote.

      "name": "Average Paella Western about a bold bank heist  by exploding dynamite  and  carried out by a misfit  band of outlaws",
      "reviewBody": "Middling Chorizo western with typical Spaghetti actors . It is set in Nevada , in Sun Valley town , a place full of mud and dirtiness , with its Public School and the Sun Valley Bank , it is a very famous bank for being the safest office in the West , that&apos;s why it has never been robbed . But a gang led by Michigan (Mark Edwards) formed by grizzled gunslingers (Piero Lulli , Fernando Bilbao , Fernando Sancho , Frank Bra√±a , Charly Bravo) arrives in the town in search of gold and they execute scheming plans to steal it by using dynamite , digging underground , and blow it up . Both of whom match wills and wits and ambition among them , and most especially greed threaten to turn their successful hold-up into disaster . Although they have to wait on Saturday , that&apos;s why the bank is next to the public school . Meanwhile , a loving triangle is developed among Poldo (Charly Bravo) , the saloon girl Sophia (Barbara Carroll) and her sister , the kiddies school teacher named Marion (Carmen Sevilla) . Along the way , the bandit Reyes (Fernando Sancho) is incarcerated at local jail but when the bank explosion takes place he escapes . Through enormous difficulties , they eventually succeed in robbing gold . At the end they struggle among themselves to unearth the golden bars from a remote location falling prey to each other&apos;s bullets. \n\nIt is an exciting Tortilla Western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia of a group of cutthroats , including showdown among them . This is a tale of robbing , ambition and killing , as various robbers fall out over the gold they have taken from a heavily guarded bank and , subsequently , being stranded on an inhospitable and extremely snowy place . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing explosions , shootouts or stunts every few minutes , including plot twists and a spectacular final confrontation . This is a tale of murders , crosses , doubl√©-crosses , fear and greed , as six colleagues fall out over the gold they have clawed out from a strange location , and , finally , besieged by snowy mountains . The moving dynamic of the motley gang together is passable and is what mostly keeps this movie going . This film belongs to Paella/Spaghetti sub-genre and particularly those Westerns set in snowy landscapes whose main classic was ¬®The great silence¬® or ¬®Il Grande Silenzio¬®(68) by Sergio Corbucci , along with ¬®Quanto Costa Morire¬®(68) by Sergio Merolle , ¬®Gli Specialist¬® by Corbucci , ¬®The call wild¬® (72) by Ken Annakin , ¬®Zanna Blanca¬® (73) , ¬®Il Ritorno De Zanna Blanca¬® (74) by Lucio Fulci , ¬®Il Richiamo Del Lupo¬® by Gianfranco Baldanello , ¬®Glubbe Rosse¬® by Joe D&apos;Amato and ¬®Cut-Throats Nine¬® or ¬®Condenados a Vivir¬® by Joaquin Romero Marchent , all of them shot in white , rocky , snowy , mountainous outdoors . The musician Stelvio Cipriani composes an ordinary but inappropriate soundtrack in the seventies style ; including catching though dated songs . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors , dirty environment in the muddy town , snowy as well as thunderous exteriors and a glimmer sun and fine sets with striking cinematography by the prestigious Hans Burmann . Cameraman Burmann has a long career from the sixties , including successes as ¬®Bearn¬®, ¬®Guantanamera¬® , ¬®Rey Pasmado¬®, ¬®Gitanos¬® , ¬®Open your eyes¬®, ¬®Tesis¬® and ¬®Los Girasoles Ciegos¬®. The picture resulted to be shot entirely on location in Aragon Pyrinees , Lerida and Huesca , and Catalu√±a\n\nThe motion picture titled ¬®The boldest job in the west¬®or ¬®Nevada¬®or ¬®El Mas Fabuloso Golpe Del Far West¬® was regularly directed by Jos√© Antonio De La Loma. He was an acceptable professional , especially famous for his ¬®Quinqui¬® movies and particularly for ¬®Perros Callejeros saga . As he directed ¬®Perros Callejeros¬®, ¬®Perros Callejeros II¬®, ¬®Ultimos Golpes Del Torete¬®, ¬®Perras Callejeras¬® and finally ¬®3 Dias De Libertad¬® . His style is pretty much urban and realistic as well in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog and attempted to take a position in favor of outcast people . Jose Antonio De La Loma chose young and natural actors as Angel Fernandez Franco ¬®Torete¬® and Bernard Seray who played their parts to the hilt , unafraid of filmmaker&apos;s unsympathetic camera and the particularity of the characters . In ¬®Perros Callejeros¬® series we see their troubles growing in such streets , slums or &quot;barrios&quot; from Barcelona and outskirts and other coastal places and some fine locations . In these films Jose Antonio De La Loma showed the ugliness of those &quot;barrios&quot; , filthiness , toughness and cold existence . In his youthful De La Loma worked as a teacher in the Chinese barrio of Barcelona and he lived poorness and isolation . As he hired true delinquents who used their peculiar slang and particular behaves , all of them give a certain realism to these offbeat films . Juan Antonio De La Loma had a long career including titles as a writer and a filmmaker in all kinds of genres , as Western : ¬®Professional for a massacre¬® ,¬®Texas Kid¬® ,¬®Clint the solitary¬® , ¬®Return of Clint¬®, ¬®The last Mohican¬®, ¬®Seven pistols for Timothy¬® , ¬®Viva Carrancho¬®, ¬®The Boldest job in the West¬®, ¬®Blood at sundown¬®or ¬®Porque Seguir Matando¬® and Action : ¬®Metralleta Stein¬® , ¬®Razzia¬® , ¬®Explosion¬® , Squadron: Counterforce¬®or &quot;Playing with Death&quot; , ¬®Goma 2¬® , ¬®Tony Carrera¬®, &quot;Playboy to Kill&quot; and several others .",

      "reviewBody": "I like the film The School of Magical Animals 2. It is entertaining with all the magical animals talking and having fun personalities. I also really like how the animals match their owners&apos; personalities. The movie has a castle in a village for the school which makes the setting very interesting. The only drawback is that, at times, it is a little repetitive.\n\nThe storyline follows Ida and Benni who attend the Winterstein School where the students are practicing a musical to show their parents and they sometimes disagree and make each feel upset or left out - but they work it out. At the end when they put on the play something strange happens and they are shocked to find out.\n\nBased on the successful German children&apos;s book series by Margit Auer, this film is a blend of CGI animation and live action. What makes it particularly fun is the talking animals, which include a talking fox, tortoise and magpie. Director Sven Unterwaldt beautifully brings this story to life. Ida, a kind and nice girl, is played by Emilia Maier, who portrays her perfectly. Her pet, Rabbat, is wonderfully voiced by Max Von der Groeben. I love watching the magical animals sing, rap, talk, and dance, and at times they advise their human friends. The animals help teach lessons in friendship, perseverance, and the importance of sharing feelings. Another fun fact about the animals is that they can transform into stuffed animals when needed, so they can hide from strangers. Throughout the movie, you see beautiful landscapes and European villages and castles.\n\nThe film&apos;s message is about teamwork. In the beginning, the children struggle to come as a team, but when they start to work together they start to accomplish more.\n\nI give The School Of Magical Animals 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12. It is available in theaters June 7, 2024. By Clara T., KIDS FIRST!",

      "reviewBody": "Given the recent success of fantasy movies, it was probably inevitable that &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; would get its turn on the silver screen. Like &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; Gail Carson Levine&apos;s delightful re-imagining of Cinderella has been popular with both readers and critics, and contains plenty of imagination and engaging characters. One only wishes it had translated to screen better.\n\nLevine comes up with a clever explanation for the reason why Ella (played in the film by Anne Hathaway) must slave for her horrid step-family: at her cradle, a well-meaning but rather dim fairy godmother (Vivica A. Fox) granted her the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience, forcing the poor girl to comply with any direct order regardless of how ridiculous or dangerous. Refusing to be resigned to her lot, Ella sets out to return the unwanted gift--and en route, find romance with Prince Charmont (&quot;Char&quot; for short, played by Hugh Dancy).\n\nUnfortunately, it is here that the similarities to the source material end. In the film, Ella comes off as far less resourceful and clever as she does in the book, and mostly seems to wind up getting into embarrassing or awkward situations through her enforced compliance. Which is a shame, because Hathaway is a vibrant and talented actress who could have easily imbued the character with more spunk had she been called on to do so. It doesn&apos;t help that the screenwriters have seen fit to muddy Ella&apos;s quest with a standard-issue villain in the form of Char&apos;s Claudius-esquire uncle (Cary Elwes, channeling the spirit of Prince Humperdink and accompanied by a very unconvincing CGI snake), and some business about the oppression of the kingdom&apos;s non-humans.\n\nLike &quot;Shrek,&quot; &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; takes the fractured fairy-tale route, throwing in sly references and anachronisms at every opportunity. Some of these work (I liked the man-powered escalator in the medieval mall), but more than a few fall flat (mostly Char&apos;s squealing fan club, who are perhaps too accurate in their annoying behavior). Hathaway and Dancy play it more or less straight, but everyone else camps it up grandly, especially Elwes. Unfortunately, both Fox and Minnie Driver as Ella&apos;s more sensible godmother feel miscast, and Parminder Nagra (the talented star of &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot;) is virtually wasted as Ella&apos;s foreign-born friend.\n\n&quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; is nice enough to sit through--Hathaway&apos;s presence keeps things going, and there are enough nice visuals. But in a genre that in the past few years has seen &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot;--with &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; among the films on the horizon--it takes more than nice to distinguish oneself in the field."

For those that don&apos;t know the series: Piet is the captain of a pirate ship that is further manned by the strong Stien as the female driver, the mute Steven as the ships help, and the rotund cook Berend. Together they sail the oceans and live their adventurous lives of blood- and violence free Pirates (for this is a children&apos;s series, meant to be watched by children of all ages) In this specific adventure they come across an overly large ship and find that its crew has been turned to stone. Piet falls in love with the captain of the new found ship and so they go out to rescue the petrified crew. To do this they will have to fly the ship.\n\nIt is a typical children&apos;s film. No blood, no gore, no violence, but a lot of fun for the children that like the series - including my nephew who wanted to see it and tagged me along as the guardian). It is rather short, but I guess stretching it any further would have been making its story spread even thinner and that wouldn&apos;t work either.\n\nFun enough I guess.\n\n6 out of 10 pirates of the North Sea",

      "reviewBody": "This movie starts out appearing to be the usual b-movie shlock morality tale - and that beginning is where any similarity ends. Claudelle Inglish winds up having a place right beside movies like Showgirls and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, just for sheer shock value.\n\nThe basic premise is familiar enough, sweet young thing is seduced and then jilted. However, nobody knows that, since her beau is not a total creep; her shameful secret is still safe from the townspeople who would label her a whore - so here&apos;s where the fun starts, since our heroine, literally overnight, decides to transform herself into the town tramp anyway. Why? Uhhh, why not?\n\nOf course it would have made perfect sense for Claudelle to just go ahead and marry the older, unappealing rich man who all but drools on her, but that would be too easy, and it won&apos;t happen here. In fact nothing here plays out the way you would expect it to, and that is the brilliance of this film and why it is something you have to see to believe.\n\nThis is trash at its very finest, and to tell anything more about what happens after Claudelle creates her own hell would spoil everything.",

If you look up my review for Swamp Thing, you&apos;ll see that I didn&apos;t care to much for it. This, on the other hand, was great! They decided to go with the over-the-top comic-book style that the original skirted, which made the movie a lot more enjoyable. The effects improved greatly, the creatures in this actually looked like some effort was put into them! I especially liked the updated Swamp Thing costume, made him look a lot better and more intimidating. Louis Joudan was thankfully back, and his character, Dr. Anton Arcane, was even better than ever! His step-daughter Abby, played by Heather Locklear, was one of many great comic relief characters, along with the bumbling head of security named Gunn, and many others. The side plot with two kids trying to get Swampy&apos;s picture was a tad annoying, but it had it&apos;s amusing moments. Overall, this was a great intentionally cheesy B-movie, that you really should check out! \n\n8/10",

Hmm...\n\nThat being said, the camera work is pretty great, as is the case with most of Malick&apos;s work, but that&apos;s pretty much it. There is almost no story to speak of, to even remember as I write this review. The French woman could have gone back home at any time and spared everyone the pain of their crappy relationship. Instead, she decides to draw out what everyone knows is a doomed scenario.\n\nMalick should honestly have retired with the Tree of Life. It was excellent, and utilized the dreamy, wide-angle drawn out sequences very well, unlike here, where they are relied on to make up for a lack of substance.\n\nI don&apos;t really recommend this film to anyone. If you are a Malick fan, it will severely diminish your appreciation for him, as it is as pretentious as it is boring.",

Once again, Fetchit plays a rather sub-human part but at least he&apos;s a little less degrading than usual and the rest of the film is exceptional.\n\nThis film is very much like a combination of a Chan film and a mummy film--and because of the interesting backdrop the film seems far fresher and more interesting than most in the series. Charlie has been sent to an archaeological dig by a French museum. It seems the museum is justifiably angry because items from the tomb belong to them but someone has been selling them to collectors and other museums. Naturally, when Chan arrives people begin to die and it&apos;s up to Charlie to get to the bottom of it.\n\nDespite not having any of the Chan children (particularly the ever enjoyable Keye Luke as &quot;Lee&quot;), this is a dandy film with some interesting twists and a mystery that is a tad over-complicated but fun to unravel. As far as my feelings about Fetchit, in this film he didn&apos;t act that much different than the Birmingham Brown character from the later Chan film, so perhaps I am just being a tad oversensitive. It&apos;s just that in so many prior films Fetchit was the living embodiment of all the negative Black stereotypes--so bad that seeing him once again kind of made me cringe.",

      "reviewBody": "The madness of Godfrey Ho and Joseph Lai strike again, and strike hard in this monster movie that features some Hong Kong heavies in the shape of Danny Lee and more!\n\nBlended with the usual unmatched footage of Westerners to help sell abroad, this hilarious mess is about a little girl and her pet snake (that is surprisingly smart and understands her native tongue) who get mixed up with some scientists schemes of making plants and animals 300 - 1000 times their size.\n\nOf course, the formula falls into the hands of said girl, who&apos;s pet snake soon becomes bigger than any movie monster we&apos;ve seen and enjoys playing hide and seek with her.\n\nAs the bad guys and army chase down the formula and girl, the snake gets more and more angry, and bigger, and soon we are delivered scene upon scene of Godzilla like miniatures and models that kinda work.\n\nAs mad as it is, and as annoying as the little girl is, Thunder Of The Gigantic Serpent is still quite enjoyable. Its crazy yes, but there is plenty of action, monster madness and overall entertainment to get through.\n\nFar from perfect, but very ambitious even for schlock-miester Godfrey Ho...",

It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real &quot;feel-good&quot; movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released. The voice actors are excellent and the animation is amazing. I&apos;ve been to Paris before and the overall views were very accurate. At times I could tell exactly where in the city the events were taking place. Overall a fabulous movie, I highly recommend it!",

However none of this would mattered if the film had realised its potential \n\nThe problem with the potential is there&apos;s a lot of scope for cruel things to happen . Certainly an idea of a super intelligent self aware virus is a good premise which could have ended up as a cross between PULSE and TERMINATOR 2:JUDGEMENT DAY . Unfortunately we once again endure TVM style kitchen sink dramas when we should have been watching lots of people suffering a grisly fate like the occupants of a lift , so the potential is sadly wasted",

      "reviewBody": "I remember what a raw shock of creative energy this film was when it came out, and I still marvel at what an imaginative way the director found to tell this crazy, immoral tale. The superb cinematography; the amazing cast of young actors (who have all gone on to become hugely successful in film and tv since); the iconic soundtrack: it all just fits together perfectly. &apos;Trainspotting&apos; is as hilarious as it is deeply disturbing, but most importantly (and unlike many other films concerned with addiction) it&apos;s one hell of an entertaining flick and doesn&apos;t drag for a second.\n\nWe all know drugs are bad. The problem is, they can also be fun - at least at the beginning, which is one of the reasons people are drawn to them. &apos;Trainspotting&apos; is the first movie I remember watching that actually conveyed that seductive quality of drugs and managed to honestly portray the reckless, hedonistic lifestyle a part of my generation - the so called &quot;Generation X&quot; - fell victim to. It&apos;s an amazing achievement, in every regard; not only does it manage to be true to its serious subject matter without resorting to moralizing, it&apos;s also masterclass filmmaking and a milestone of British Cinema. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",

Story (1991) is a great romantic fantasy comedy from Mick Jackson.It&apos;s written by Steve Martin, who also gives an amazing performance in the lead.This 59 year old comedian has made us laughed in many hilarious movies in the past.Hopefully he still will do so in the future.Let&apos;s see how he can fill the shoes of Peter Sellers in the upcoming Pink Panther movie.Other actors do a great job as well.Sarah Jessica Parker can be seen there before she was a huge star.This year she stopped working in Sex and the City after six years.You can also see, more or less, people like Richard E. Grant, Iman, Rick Moranis, Chevy Chase, Kevin Pollak, Patrick Stewart and Woody Harrelson.L.A. Story is a declaration of love to Los Angeles like Woody Allen has made many to New York.This movie is full of extremely funny scenes.I found myself laughing many times watching this movie.Isn&apos;t that what makes a good comedy?"

Screwy Squirrel&apos;s second cartoon, after &apos;Screwball Squirrel&apos;, &apos;Happy-Go-Nutty&apos; is just as good. There is not much happy here, but it is nutty, creative and despite its violent nature entertaining. Despite being a compelling, much more anarchic than his sweet appearance and funny character, as well as being charismatic enough to carry his cartoons as a lead character (as he does here), it is somewhat easy to see why Screwy didn&apos;t click and didn&apos;t last long, being a brash character with few sympathetic qualities. His opponent is a lot of fun.\n\nTex Avery does a wonderful job directing, with his unique, unlike-any-other visual and humour style all over it once again.\n\n&apos;Happy-Go-Nutty&apos;, as with &apos;Screwball Squirrel&apos;, is wonderfully over-the-top, very creative in its violent nature and some of it is hilarious (like the explosive apple, the telephone and the soda), avoiding the potential trap of being too cutesy.\n\nOnce again, &apos;Happy-Go-Nutty&apos; as always with Avery is beautifully animated. The character designs are unique, Avery always did have creative character designs, and suitably fluid. The music, courtesy of Scott Bradley, is lushly and cleverly orchestrated, with lively and energetic rhythms and fits very well indeed.\n\nVoice acting is very good. My only real complaint is that the cartoon ends a little too abruptly.\n\nOtherwise, a great cartoon. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It is also a no-brainer entertainment for the family where kids could watch it as a slap-stick frivolously fun fairy tale, which adults could do likewise, or take it as satirical of the east European historical context.\n\nAlso known as The Three Veterans, this movie was made in 1984, although it has the bygone look and innocence of a 1950s comedy, where the money is definitely incurred on costumes and sets with a good helping of eye pleasing outdoor shoots. The &apos;special effect&apos; is nothing more than what a 1950s movie could muster, which in fact adds to the charm of it. Importantly, the cast seems to genuinely enjoy the silliness of it all.\n\nIncidentally, one of the secondary cast members, Zdenek Sver√É¬°k, eventually played the main character in the 1996 Oscar winning foreign movie, Kolya (which is also another excellent movie - a drama-comedy).\n\nIf you are into Terry Gilliam, then The Three Veterans is strongly recommended, and is additionally interesting given that it is fully an eastern European effort. Go get it!",

      "reviewBody": "Movies,at least in India are meant for true entertainment and a stress busters for employees and many other sections of life.When they are filled with in a noble content nourished with entertainment,a viewer will have something to take home with and the filmmakers too are a satisfied lot .This one didn&apos;t manage the latter part but touched my heart for the sincerity the movie was made with by S.M.Abbas. After a tiring Friday,to chill myself out here came the Raj Kapoor starer Shriman Satyawadi which was released in 1960 which focuses on how truth has become an ugly word to this society.One more aspect about the movie is that,despite the movie being made 5 decades ago it still maintains connectivity with the viewer.Probably that&apos;s why Raj Kapoor&apos;s films have an immortal quality and his films still enchant many film lovers.\n\nThe film journeys on an honest guy who believes nothing can replace truth and ethics and those values will sometime or the other come in handy-Though the film has traces of Shree 420 in the honesty aspect,the other parts were quite different, well structured and enacted.30 minutes into the movie and you&apos;re sunk into Vijay&apos;s world and we forget the actor portraying it.That&apos;s called acting and that&apos;s class.Raj Kapoor&apos;s uncanny knack of managing comedy and emotions at once is real quality to be observed.Never do the characters make us feel they &apos;rent believable. In the post interval the film&apos;s pace slackens and the scenes appear more clich√©d.Nevertheless the chemistry between the lead pair makes it up.Shakila&apos;s never over the top and does her bit with a unique charm.Mehmood isn&apos;t at his best but fits in well enough.The journalist character too is very noble in character and though there&apos;s limited screen space it&apos;s presence adds solidity to the movie.This one doesn&apos;t make it into the list of classics but will make for a good watch on a lazy evening.It has a moral and with accomplished acting performances from the cast,it&apos;ll keep you satisfied.This movie&apos;s far better than the crap we&apos;re put up to by the so called actors of today.Decent script,efficient screenplay,reasonable music!It&apos;s a well packaged neat entertainer for a family! Refresh yourself with this!!Remember ,truth will and only prevail!Though late,it yields success and ensures a purposeful existence.",

      "reviewBody": "Director, Ivan Zulueta&apos;s sublime &apos;Arrebato&apos; (1979) is an extraordinarily oblique, insidiously disturbing, deliciously deranged Spanish nightmare, and for reasons that still elude me, this psychotronic oddity remains largely undocumented, and is greatly deserving of a pristine, fan-pleasing Blu-ray restoration! This divinely sinister piece of stylish movie macabre, eerily documents the gradual subversion, and inexorable psychological collapse of a young, hopelessly dope-addled, profoundly jaded filmmaker&apos;s life. He is pitilessly plunged into a darkly descending, surrealist miasma, over the ostensibly vampiric properties of an especially hypnotic, phantasmagorical super-8 film that once seen is not soon forgotten! To reiterate, &apos;Arrebato&apos; is a strikingly lucid and fiercely imaginative work of fantastically far-out cinema that includes some genuinely unsettling sequences. The impressively iconoclastic film&apos;s singularly intriguing narrative enigma grips you firmly right from the exquisitely terse opening gambit, and then invidiously immerses the increasingly discombobulated viewer into its unrelenting maelstrom of hallucinatory strangeness! Ivan Zulueta&apos;s beautifully audacious work of uniquely twisted torment is a sublimely suffocating, chillingly claustrophobic, bravura, B-movie Bunuel for the more diabolically minded, scream-seeking, Euro-cult maniacs to enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched the Eloy de la Iglesia classic from Spain üá™üá∏, Navajeros (1980), on Shudder. The storyline follows a group of Spanish teens in Madrid who survive on the streets by stealing and living a life of crime. The leader of the gang, Jaro, meets a prostitute who loves him and wants him to settle down and live up to his potential. But can Jaro be tamed, or is he destined for the streets?\n\nThis film is directed by Eloy de la Iglesia (El pico 1 &amp; 2), and stars Jos√© Luis Manzano (El pico 1 &amp; 2), Isela Vega (Barbarosa), Enrique San Francisco (Birdboy: The Forgotten Children), and Mar√≠a Mart√≠n (A Candidate for a Killing).\n\nI always enjoy Eloy de la Iglesia&apos;s street life and drug-related movies. These are underrated grindhouse cult classics. The acting is top-notch and authentic, and there are some beautiful ladies with plenty of nudity. The flow of the story is unique, blending street fights, gang activity, drug dealing, robbery, and sex. There&apos;s a hilarious monkey scene, a fun park fight, and a butt stab that had me laughing. The creativity in the fight sequences is impressive, and the ending is magnificent and very well done.\n\nIn conclusion, Navajeros is an elite street culture film that&apos;s an absolute must-see. I would score this an 8/10.",

Heester&apos;s chumminess with Hitler is no secret of course but this did not prevent his career continuing unabated and he performed into advanced old age. The recent revelations that Jacoby&apos;s wife, the talented, tantalising force of nature that is Marika Rokk may have been a Russian spy adds further spice to the mix. No subtitles alas but the music and the performers should carry you along.",

      "reviewBody": "A contagious virus escapes from a research facility turning people into flesh eating killers. The city is quarantined and a soldier and his team are hired to rescue his daughter.\n\nChristopher Hatton writes and directs this low budget science fiction romp that fuses two sub-genre subjects, the modern zombie-infected and Robots. Coincidently it shares the same basic concept as Zombie Massacre (2013) and elements from a lesser known zombie film Severed: Forest of the Dead (2005).\n\nShaky camera shots aside it&apos;s a b-film that has atmosphere thanks to the unusual Malaysian location and interesting architecture. The generic costume design fittingly works, the music by Joe Ng and Ting Si Hao although borrowing from many sci-fi films is excellent. The violence is aplenty, with the gun and abundance of knife play being effective enough.\n\nThere&apos;s no small Dolph Lundgren cameo it&apos;s very much is his film focusing on his Max Gatling character throughout. Both actresses Oda Maria as Anna and Melanie Zanetti as Jude are notable with the rest of the cast being adequate given Hatton&apos;s limited script. The zombies sadly are not the slow shambling kind and the robot CGI effects are a mixed bag. Nevertheless, the relationship between both the main robot (voiced by Tim Cooper) and Max is quiet interesting and humorous. Beneath the low end production there is quite a good story even if it swaps development, depth and pacing for action.\n\nDon&apos;t expect too much, Hatton has a lot on his hands juggling all the high concept elements coherently and keeps it linear but what is on offer is the infected, robots and soldier high-jinks and basically that&apos;s what it delivers."

      "reviewBody": "In this romantic comedy, Alex &apos;Hitch&apos; Hitchins (Will Smith) is a  legendary but anonymous date doctor in New York City. Hitch advises  klutzy male wallflower clients on ways to make good first impressions  on the women of their dreams. To contact Hitch, a man must have a  referral from one of his former clients. Once Hitch accepts you as a  client, he will coach you on your first three dates; after that, you&apos;re  on your own. Hitch&apos;s newest client is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), a  fat tax accountant in love with a celebrity client, Allegra Cole (Amber  Valetta). Allegra doesn&apos;t know that Albert exists, so Albert contacts  Hitch to make his dream come true. Hitch decides to make Albert a  client, even though, he knows this is going to be tough. While working  on this job, Hitch meets Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a gossip reporter for  a daily tabloid, who is following Allegra&apos;s every move. Sara has given  up on men, and Hitch wants to cut through that layer, because he is the  master of love, so he thinks. With Valentine&apos;s Day around the corner,  this is a good date movie. Women will love it, and men may pick up a  few pointers. The movie is hilarious and filled with verbal and  slapstick comedy from beginning to end. There are several scenes that  may make you bust a gut laughing. (Columbia, Run time 1:55, Rated  PG-13)(8/10)"

      "reviewBody": "The only real reason I give this excellent documentary an 8 is because Julio Medem was unable to get the key players in the conflict, ETA and PP, to participate, which I felt was a crucial loss to the movie. Also, it was a LOT of information to process, and although I watched it with English subtitles, I had to replay scenes very often.\n\nI had only some very shallow, not even basic, knowledge of the Basque conflict before watching this. I am studying abroad in Spain, and a professor here recommended this, and I wanted to learn more. I didn&apos;t even bother testing my Spanish and watched it in English to understand it the best. Even then, it is not a movie made for beginners. But beginner or not, I still recommend this movie to anyone interested, just as long as they read up a little on the Basque Country and Spanish political parties first as background info.\n\nHowever, despite the confusion and incomplete variety of interviewees, as a journalism student, I say the documentary was beautifully, intriguingly, insightfully, and ingeniously done. Even though it was confusing, it was INCREDIBLY informative, and my goal of learning more about the history, culture, and conflict in the region was met and surpassed. It was deemed very controversial for showing such an array of perspectives, but I felt this was best and very raw and as objective as one can get, especially for a Basque director. And despite the crazy amount of information, it still kept me glued to the screen.\n\nThe artistic aspect was brilliant, too, especially for an independent film. I really loved the flip flop, from interviews in beautiful Basque landscapes to clips of the metaphoric pelota vasca to the old black-and-white film by Orson Welles to clips of old historical videos to Mikel Laboa crooning his sometimes beautifully melodic and sometimes strikingly dissonant music. I want to especially applaud the music: it is absolutely stunning and perfect!\n\nI highly recommend this documentary."

      "reviewBody": "I again want to give this the full five, but not sure. I don&apos;t get why more people don&apos;t like this. It&apos;s so underrated, and yet it&apos;s everything people love about Arnold and his movies. Loud, big, violent action, cheesy one-liners, a good villain, and this time it even has entertainingly bad CGI an Vanessa Williams, which are two things I&apos;m always down with watching. Mm\n\nArnold takes himself more seriously here it seems, at least until the second act. He delivers a great, movie-carrying performance as usual, and is compliment by the weirdly good Vanessa Williams, who ends up not being annoying. James Caan is a great villain, and definitely helps elevate it.\n\nThe action is exactly as you&apos;d expect. With a plot involving big, hi-tech &quot;chainguns&quot;, you know this is gonna be good. The opening house scene, the cabin scene, the plane scene, the zoo shootout, and the lab shootout are all cool, along with other scenes. The plane scene defies any logic or realism, and is lots of fun. The CGI is bad, but whatever. There&apos;s also a scene with a bad CGI crocodile that rips a dude&apos;s arm off, and attacks Arnold, who makes up for the effects by kicking it in the face and shooting it. The final battle though, is just perfect. It&apos;s total balls-out action, with Arnold becoming a one-man army as usual, and shooting tons of people with two chainguns before fighting James Caan on top of a giant metal container.\n\nI really love this and recommend it. It needs more attention and is as good as most of Arnold&apos;s other films.",

The film builds a genuine sense of suspense and has enough scares to lift it above the usual low budget horror. This is in no small part due to a hugely likable and confident performance by the lead actress Leah Pipes. \n\nThe limitations in budget do show in the special effects but if you put this aside it is a very effective and creepy horror film.",

      "reviewBody": "The main interest points in seeing &apos;Mannequin&apos; were that it was directed by Frank Borzage, a director who deserved and still does deserve more credit, and the great cast, with Joan Crawford and Spencer Tracy in their only collaboration together. That is perhaps the film&apos;s biggest draw, that they were great on their own is reason enough to see anything of theirs but seeing them together in a rare pairing is even more so.\n\nWith those things taken into account, &apos;Mannequin&apos; had all the makings to be a charming film. Which it on the most part is. Not perfect or great, and Crawford, Tracy and Borzage have all done better, but &apos;Mannequin&apos; is a nice undemanding film that doesn&apos;t feel too simplistic or too challenging and doesn&apos;t try to do or be more than necessary. While not a must see &apos;Mannequin&apos; does have more than enough to warrant more exposure.\n\n&apos;Mannequin&apos; may have corny and melodramatic parts and moments that don&apos;t quite ring true, do not expect reality here and that is including the ending (which admittedly does also strike a chord emotionally). A few of the early scenes are a bit static.\n\nAlan Curtis does his best bringing smarmy charm to his role, but the character is too one-dimensional unpleasant for the charm to properly convince.\n\nHowever, &apos;Mannequin&apos; is beautifully filmed, clearly loving Crawford (looking radiantly photogenic) and those costumes are to die for. While not one that will stay long in the memory, the score fits and complements the film well and doesn&apos;t feel like it should have belonged somewhere else. The script has wit and emotion, much of the film is far from dull once it gets going and the story has a lovely poignancy and intimacy (the dance floor scene is a lovely moment and interesting from an interaction stand-point, pointed out already) on the most part,\n\nBorzage directs with his usual sensitivity and he definitely seems at home here. What makes &apos;Mannequin&apos; especially worth watching is the cast. Whether Crawford is believable as a young working class girl is debatable, but that doesn&apos;t matter when she gives a performance so charming and deeply felt. Tracy underplays sympathetically and more than appealingly, they make a lovely pairing. Shrewd Leo Gorcey and movingly sincere Elizabeth Risdon are particularly good in support.\n\nOn the whole, nice pretty good film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

It was particularly timely with the riots this year in the streets of Budapest. The courage displayed and the sense of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation made the film especially poignant.\n\nA film worth seeing.

As their streets, culture, families and means of survival rapidly decay due to exposure to post-Yugoslavian corrupted capitalism and privatization they learn (not) to cope with the seemingly mundane problems of first love, going to college and not knowing what to do with their lives. The movie is made of little symptomatic details and seemingly pointless stunts, woven into a loose- threaded fabric. All against a stunning background of Bor and its surroundings.\n\nMaybe I am subjective and the movie means so much more to me cause I can identify with the kids. I live in a neighboring country with a neighboring language and neighboring problems, and these kids might as well be my neighbors. It&apos;s sad, but that&apos;s okay. You get used to it.",

Quoting and naming things, people and animals after characters in this movie. It brings a sense of joy and nostalgia when simply talking about it and it makes me very happy to share this small part of her childhood with me.

      "reviewBody": "Kafir (Satanic) was one of those Indonesian movies that definitely couldn&apos;t resurrect Indonesian Cinema. For the last couple of years, Indonesia is trying to make a good horror movie in a new style and that&apos;s why they were introducing new-comer directors and actors. But Kafir wasn&apos;t that type of movie. I couldn&apos;t believe why such producers create this cheap trash, while Indonesia itself is trying to lift up  its cinema.\n\nStarring the pretty well-known actress Meriam Belina and actor Sujiwo Tejo (Telegram), Kafir was a mystery movie that revolves around the style of horror movies in the 70-80s. Just think of Kafir as being one of Suzanna&apos;s movies. Yet, Suzanna might still be more watchable than Kafir. Despite its bad elements, Kafir has a pretty interesting storyline about a voodoo shaman who has done heaps of forbidden activity. He used different kind of satanic ways to increase his power and to strengthen himself. He swore that if he died, his body will not be accepted by the Earth. Sooner, he died and his oath got prevailed.\n\nBeside the interesting storyline, the way the director tells the story is quite sluggish. With some confusing flashbacks and a storytelling that doesn&apos;t seems to tell a story with a conflict and resolution, in some way, the movie did managed well to keep the audience stay tuned. Some of the cheap special effects did quite make it, but it would&apos;ve been better to use a better CGI effect. When you look at the whole thing, the movie seems to be pointless, even though it managed well in the box-office and 500 000 Indonesian moviegoers had seen it.\n\nOn the acting, Meriam Belina and Sujiwo Tejo did a great job. Sujiwo played well and convincing as a shaman while Meriam Belina did a fine job as the wife of a shaman.\n\nThe bad thing about the movie was the editing. This movie needs to be re-edited because it was horribly put together and definitely it would&apos;ve been better to have a Dolby Digital Sound Mixing. The sound effects were good but unfortunately some of them were not in the right place and position.\n\nKafir was simply an ordinary mythical mystery movie. It certainly needs more improvement to do and with more budget, this movie could look much better. Overall, I still think that it&apos;s a bad movie because it doesn&apos;t delivers much to the audience. The movie was expected to premiere in Singapore, but I don&apos;t think it will do good!",

      "reviewBody": "An emotive tale of triumph and redemption , being based on a true story . Sport film with sentimental story and intelligent character studio . Classic story rings true because of Shia Labeouf&apos;s complex and adequate acting and stunningly realized by director Bill Paxton . Exceptional Shia Labeouf displaying a first rate performance reaching an important milestone and a terrific Stephen Dillane as his upright as well as serious contender . In the 1913 US Open, 20-year-old Francis Ouimet (Shia Labeouf) gets a chance as he played against his idol, 1900 US Open champion , Englishman Harry Vardon (Stephan Dillane) . Amateur player Francis gets to achieve for big time , thanks to the coach , as he triumphs over by odds , but sheer determination helps them attain their dream . Ouimet dreams of playing final Open , as he gets the chance to participate in the International Golf Championship against his idol , no matter how far-fetched the dream . Meanwhile , he falls in love for a rich young girl called Sarah Wallis (Peyton List) . But he has an intelligent skill to no match for the class boundaries ; however , being pressurized by his father (Elias Koteas) . \n\nFrom the studio that brought you ¬®The rookie¬® , ¬®Miracle¬® and ¬®Remember the Titans¬® is realized this agreeable tale based on the 1913 USA Open in which took part famous international champs , it contains a classic plot and deals about a slice of American history , and is plenty of good feeling , heartfelt, interesting characters and formidable performances . However , sometimes is some sentimental and predictable but is still pretty amusing . Correctly based on real events as the actual Francis Ouimet and Eddie Lowery remained life long friends . When Ouimet died in 1967, Lowery was one of the pall-bearers . Likable and enjoyable plot about a young golfer and his coach and caddie , both of them face the dual challenge to win a world championship and redeeming themselves . Splendid film from the filmmaker Bill Paxton and writer/producer Mark Frost of another David beats Goliath sports movie , similarly to ¬®Rudy¬® with Sean Astin and ¬®Hoosiers¬® with Gene Hackman , and it is even better than ¬®The legend of Bagger Vance¬® with Will Smith and Matt Damon . Sentimental plot stretches Hollywood manipulation , but is still entertaining . Shia LaBeouf delivers an engaging acting as Francis Ouimet ; he is backed by a good supporting cast such as Luke Askew as Alec Campbell , Stephen Marcus as Ted Ray , Peter Firth as Lord Northcliffe , Len Cariou as Stedman , Elias Koteas as his stiff father Arthur Ouimet and special mention to Stephan Dillane as Harry Vardon , protagonist&apos;s idol as well as contender . \n\nSpectacular and rousing musical score by Brian Tyler , fitting perfectly to action . Fine production design and good sets , filmmakers had trouble filling the fields with extras for the final game, and needed to move people around when shooting different angles ; extras were given 1910&apos;s hairstyles and their clothing was checked for anachronisms . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Shane Hurlbut ; filmed at the Kanawaki Golf Club outside Montreal, Quebec, producers had the club house painted yellow for the film from its original white. Members so liked the change that they kept the color following filming. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Bill Paxton , he&apos;s a notorious producer/director and especially actor ; being this one his second film , the first one was a nice terror film titled ¬®Frailty¬® with Matthew McConaughey . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile seeing .",

This is another failed attempt by Hollywood to Americanize a French movie which is everything that this film is not. One of the biggest problems with this film is that the boy is so unlikeable - probably a fault of both the script and the actor. You can&apos;t believe that anyone would care that this little idiot ran away from home, and that two people were desperate enough to be his father to chase after him. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss &amp; Nastassja Kinski have very little to do in their respective roles, especially Kinski, whose role is more of a cameo than a role of any substance. The entire setting and story behind the boys disappearance is ridiculous, as is the sub-plot involving Kinski&apos;s husband trying to find the boy as well. The leads are just not up to scratch compared to their usual comic abilities. A real let down, and a total waste of time.",

Despite a good cast (including Charlton Heston, Yvette Mimieux, and James Darren), the characters themselves aren&apos;t a very likable lot, and the plot-developments are eventually stagnated by Roberts and Green&apos;s lack of inspiration and invention. There was potential here for a really strong melodrama, but it goes unrealized. The Hawaiian locales are certainly nice compensation, as is Johnny Williams&apos; rousing score. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, hats off to the cast for giving such power-packed performances. I would say Sushmita did her best in this movie. Ila Arun was also sensational! This is truly Mithun&apos;s comeback film. He proved his high caliber and extraordinary talent, which I was completely unaware of. Elaan and Lucky didn&apos;t showcase his talent at all. The story is bold, and Lajmi courageously exposes an injustice in the Indian villages prevalent since the beginning of society where hypocrites like the priest played by Mithun thoroughly exploit the caste system and play the role of God, giving an ultimatum on every issue in the village while womanizing and abusing prostitutes at night. However, despite all of the film&apos;s strengths, these issues have been tackled numerous times in Bollywood. This film, particularly its climax, reminded me a lot of Daman. What is also irritating is that Chingaari is in the form of a narrative. At times it becomes extremely boring. I think Lajmi didn&apos;t do a good job converting from a theater production to a cinema format. I would prefer to see this on the stage than on DVD.",

Great believable acting, interesting, twisting story with well developed characters and some light humor, the direction effectively created a sense of tension and suspense that is rarely seen these days in horror films and thrillers. In the end a job well done by all. I remember seeing a similar film at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal two years ago, called Dead End with Ray Wise. If you have seen that one and liked it as much as I did, then you will surely like this one.\n\nNot to be missed and I really hope that this one gets out there and is seen by as many people as possible!",

      "reviewBody": "Soviet films are probably the best ones that were made in Russia. And today I&apos;m talking about one of them.\n\nWizards (Charodei) is set in a magical institute called NUINU during last days of the year. Where everyone prepared for the celebration. Including Alena, who is in love with an average guy Ivan. But Kira Shamacganskya, the principal of the institute, is upset that Alena has a crush on him, because Kira assumes that she tries to steal her lover. So, since she&apos;s a witch, she casts a frozen heart spell. And afterwards, Alena turns into a cold hearted woman, who likes to insult colleagues. The only way to break the spell, is for Ivan to kiss her until the new year starts.\n\nThe plot seems to be like a romantic office movie, but with fairy tale stuff being added to the mix. One of the issues that the movie has is that it can be boring for the kids to watch. Yes, it does have some things like spells, wands, Skatert Samobranka (magic table carpet that makes food out of nowhere), and other fantasy elements. But they aren&apos;t as prominent as you expect to be. And if you take them out, then the movie would be slightly different, but mostly the same. Like I said, it&apos;s not really a kids film, but rather for teenagers and young adults. Luckily, it doesn&apos;t have any adult content, so it&apos;s still safe for young ones to watch it. The reason why it&apos;s for older ones is simply because of the plot more targeted to them. Now, out of the way, I&apos;d like to stay that for the most part it&apos;s enjoyable, but can get boring a bit. The preparation of the new year and presentation of the magic wand introduces the audience to the world that they would spend time in. And after Alena&apos;s cursed, they would root for Ivan to get to the destination point as fast as possible.\n\nSince this is a musical, it has a lot of songs obviously. Probably the best ones belong to Alena, in both nice and mean personalities. And my favorite has to the witch river. It has dumb lyrics, that tell about the crystal clear water that no one should drink, yet it&apos;s catchy. Another one by her is the Women&apos;s secret, which is about each woman having some kind of a secret that makes her special. It&apos;s a pretty lyrical song. I also liked the villains&apos; song by Kira and the love song by Ivan. Both describe the mood of the characters and their desires. However, the ones performed by Ivan&apos;s young sister Nina are the most forgettable ones. The three white horses isn&apos;t really special, but still ok. I actually disliked the snowflake song, and it&apos;s my least favorite. Because I disliked the vocals, that were too high pitched and the lyrics were lame. It&apos;s just about a snowflake and the new year wish making. It&apos;s pretty cliche. Others like time to sleep, centaurs, don&apos;t believe and serenade were good and enjoyable.\n\nThe characters were mostly great. I especially liked Kira, who is a witch that wants to control the institute and make things her own way. She reminds me of Serafim Ogurcov from the Carnival night, she&apos;s kinda like his female witch counterpart. She&apos;s mostly calm, yet still evil in her way. Alena is a character that in the beginning was like a teenage girl, that would dream about love, but after a curse, she becomes more mean and annoyed. I like how the sudden contrast shows us how Alena was before and her new self. She seems to also be a cheater as well, where she flirts with a co-worker Sataneev, who had a crush on Alena. I liked both her sides to be honest. And I liked that there&apos;s still a nice version of her when she&apos;s asleep and dreaming. Ivan is the hero that has to save the day or in this case an entire year. All he needs to do is to kiss Alena. He has to go through different obstacles to do so, even if he doesn&apos;t believe in them in the beginning. He&apos;s a good character, because you actually root for him and sometimes even want to help him go through them. I also liked one running gag character that was a tourist who couldn&apos;t find the exit throughout the movie. Which was funny. But there&apos;s one character that I disliked a lot, and it&apos;s Nina. Like I mentioned before, she&apos;s Ivan&apos;s younger sister and she actually got on my nerves. Anyways, Nina was annoying, because she wanted to help Ivan, yet not knowing about the dangers. What&apos;s worse is that, she&apos;s mostly a pointless character, you can easily replace her with some other character like maybe an animal sidekick or nothing will change. I guess she was created only for the kids so they could associate themselves with, which is a pretty stupid reason, since it makes no sense. And like I said, her songs were the worst, but not terrible, which means mediocre. Other characters were ok, but not really memorable. Sateneev is a flirting type, there were two assistants that could teleport to various locations, and were the typical comedic duo. And that&apos;s it.\n\nFinally, the movie itself was made well. Like the special effects and locations. The places include the institute, the winter forest and a isbushka. All of them look convincing and creative. And thanks to the new year atmosphere both the movie and the musical numbers look more fun and colourful to make the whole experience more enjoyable.\n\nWizards isn&apos;t exactly a must watch, since it&apos;s plot is not too enjoyable for young audience, it had an annoying side character that served little to no purpose, and some songs weren&apos;t great. It still has good elements like the main characters such as Ivan, Alena and Kira, some great songs too and an actually decent plot. This is for all the Soviet movie and musical fans out there. And make sure to turn the movie during new year, cause it&apos;s a perfect time to do so. As for myself, then I enjoyed the film enough, though I wish I could add and remove some elements to make it better.",

The soundtrack of the movie was plain and boring. The other actors were quite good and convincing. Mia Kirshner did a very good job as a supporting actress. Tom Ellis appeared seldom during the movie and his character was not properly developed. I also had the feel that there were some scenes cut from the movie. I believe that Heather Graham ruined the movie with her role. The movie is a comedy, but the only time when I laugh was when they did a scene with a cake(inspired from American Pie). Yes, I paid more on the popcorn than I did on the ticket. Comparing the value of the popcorn with the value of the movie, all I can say is that the popcorn worth every penny.",

The movie&apos;s world is bleak and bitter (reading about Norse religion will show you that the Vikings lived in a bleak and bitter world), but Tim Robbins&apos; idealistic and earnest Erik is just sweet and hopeful enough to keep things interesting, rather than completely depressing.  The casting is excellent. Particularly noteworthy are Jones himself as a king who quite literally only sees what he wants to see; Eartha Kitt as a very effective and chilling Norse goddess (yeah, it sounds weird, but it&apos;s perfectly done); and Antony Sher, whose Loki is equal parts weasel and villain.  You&apos;ll be disappointed if you come in expecting over-the-top Pythonesque zany-ness, but to me, this movie felt like a maturation of that style.  The satire is still there but it&apos;s more sober than frenetic.  I only rated this movie an 8 because I don&apos;t watch it very often, but it&apos;s probably my favorite of all the Pythons&apos; solo projects.",

      "reviewBody": "...as long as you keep in mind they tried to do something different with the franchise. As such, the fifth installment is more of a supernatural morality tale in the line of Angel Heart and Jacob&apos;s Ladder.  Everything does make sense, if you get all the way to the end.\n\nWhether you like the inclusion of the Cenobites depends on whether you think they have to be center-stage or not. They basically do what they&apos;re supposed to here, and this movie does a better job of establishing how they torture people (as opposed to just ripping people apart in ugly ways) then the previous movies have done. The idea that they engage in psychological torture is one that none of the previous movies in the series have expanded upon in any great depth (although the fact they inflict pleasure as well as pain still needs to be touched upon a little more - the twin she-Cenobites kinda hint at this, though).\n\nBasically this is perhaps the more subtle of the movies in the series, due to the apparent requirement that the Cenobites not play a large part. Rewatch it a time or two without the expectations that this will be a blood-oozing, skin-rippping &quot;Pinhead movie&quot; like the others, and you might be surprised.",

The Three Caballeros is full of cute humor early in the movie, and the rapport between Donald Duck and Joe Carioca is wonderful.  The animated short `The Cold-Blooded Penguin&apos; is *very* cute, and the song `Baia&apos; is one of my favorite Disney songs of all time.  Then Panchito arrives, and after the wonderful `Three Caballeros&apos; song, things start to go a little bit crazy.  The plot, such as it was, completely evaporates as Donald seems to descend into a girl-crazy madness.  I&apos;m not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, however; the final part of the movie is very entertaining, even though it&apos;s odd at the same time.  I gave this movie an 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "More historical curiosity than entertaining science fiction film, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; is a must see for those interested in the evolution of the genre and the political climate of the early cold war years. Don&apos;t expect any cheap thrills or exploitation elements. There are no aliens, no monsters, and no hot women. Instead it presents a detailed speculation of what they thought it would be like to go to the moon in a rocket-ship. Despite looking like a massive version of a Von Braun rocket from WWII, the speculation about the problems faced by the engineers and crew of such a product are surprisingly accurate and must have been fascinating viewing back in 1950. Both the rocket and the moon are considerably more realistic than the old &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; stuff.\n\nLike another science fiction classic &quot;Them&quot;, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; is loaded with political references conveying a not so subtle distrust of the federal government. But the two films convey the same message from polar opposite perspectives. &quot;Them&quot; placed the blame for its giant mutations on reckless atomic bomb testing and portrayed the federal response to the crisis as clueless until assisted by local law enforcement and an eccentric university scientist. &quot;Destination Moon&quot; has a hawkish perspective, with unidentified fifth columnists sabotaging America&apos;s early space program. Fortunately, selfless patriotic industrialists come to the rescue and finance a successful private enterprise program to claim the moon for the United States.\n\nThe deliberately low-key documentary style is relieved by the last minute addition of space novice Joe Sweeney (Dick Wesson) to the crew. With a Brooklyn accent (his first view of earth from space elicits a desire to know who is pitching for the Dodgers that day) Sweeney provides both comic relief and an excuse for the expect members of the crew to expound in layman&apos;s terms about the details of space travel. I couldn&apos;t help thinking of &quot;Dark Star&apos;s&quot; Sgt. Pinback whenever Sweeney began to whine about not belonging on the mission.\n\nAnother concession to the unsophisticated 1950&apos;s audience has the project leaders making their pitch for financing through a special Woody Woodpecker space training film. The skeptical fowl and his two audiences receive their indoctrination at the same time. &quot;Destination Moon&quot; must have infused the nation with a sense of wonder and faith in what the free enterprise system could achieve because it is actually listed as an event in NASA&apos;s chronology of the history of space travel. It is likely that the producers were more successful with this upbeat message than with their attempt to spread fear and promote a space race. Although considerable effort is made to sell the audience on the military value of the moon nothing very convincing is presented in that regard. Ironically, much of the actual space race a few years later would have a military purpose.\n\n&quot;Destination Moon&quot; has two moments of suspense. The first is when Charles Cargraves (played by Warner Anderson) exits the ship in space and drifts away once his magnetic boots lose contact with the ship. Since Cargraves is the ship&apos;s designer, it seems rather implausible that he should forget this but no more so than his constructing the ship out of heavy steel. The second is when they botch the landing and must lighten the ship to have enough fuel to return to earth (of course we 21st century viewers knew the thing was too heavy as soon as we learned about the magnetic boot thing).\n\nScience fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein teamed with producer George Pal to put &quot;Destination Moon&quot; into production. They soon learned that Kurt Neumann was working to release &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; in time to benefit from their publicity campaign. For legal reasons Neumann modified his more sensational film to feature a landing on Mars rather than on the moon. Although Neumann&apos;s paid less attention to scientific details, it turned out to be more accurate in the use of a two-stage rocket and not the one-stage monster featured in the Heinlein/Pal version. Both films were subject to staggering naivet√© about the complexity of space travel. Although the film&apos;s version of the moon surface is hauntingly beautiful (thanks to Chesley Bonestell&apos;s backdrop paintings) it looks more like a dried lake-bed than the actual lunar surface.\n\nIn retrospect, &quot;Destination Moon&apos;s&quot; most unique sci-fi genre feature is the absolute refusal of its producers to show anything that deviated from what they believed at the time to be the truth about space travel. Although today it is a struggle to really appreciate the film, at least as it would have hit viewers in 1950, how many science fiction films have been criticized as being too real to be entertaining.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

This is a very rare glimpse into the lives of young women working in a jeans making factory. The filmmaker does an excellent job conveying their exhaustion and the pressure to keep up with production. The viewer can feel their pain. Through it, one sees the need to improve labor conditions not only in China, but in other parts of the world where such demands on workers are unfair and inhumane. It definitely makes one think about where their jeans came from, and where we&apos;re going in a world that allows such wonderful young women to work under such horrible circumstances.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Blood on the Land&quot; is a Drama movie in which we watch two brothers having different opinion on how they should treat their workers in the start of-the-twentieth-century in Thessaly, Greece.\n\nI liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and I found very clever the way that presented some important themes such as betrayal, resistance, and the struggle for personal identity during a time of great unrest. The direction which was made by Vasilis Georgiadis was outstanding and the way he presented the violent clash between a man and the oppressive forces that threaten his family and land was simply amazing. The interpretations of Nikos Kourkoulos who played as Odysseas Hormovas, Giannis Voglis who played as Rigas Hormovas, Manos Katrakis who played as Father Hormovas and Mary Hronopoulou who played as Eirini were breathtaking while their combination and connection were obvious throughout the movie and worked perfectly. The political and social themes which are explored in the story, give it significant weight, offering more than just action or drama. In conclusion, I have to say that &quot;Blood on the Land&quot; is a compelling, thought-provoking movie with strong interpretations and I highly recommend everyone to watch it."

No other Depeche Mode show matched the production value of the Devotional tour (Except for maybe the Music for the Masses tour when the lead singer was much healthier.\n\nSeveral books written about Depeche Mode talk about this tour as one of the biggest drug fuelled tours in history (hardened drug users were shocked at what they saw).\n\nThat being said, Dave is in his mode. Sure he may not be as alive and upbeat as the previous tours, however, the music on this album was darker which adds to the visuals. This was also one of the first tours to use a live drum kit. The first time us &apos;Devotees&apos; got to hear a harder edge to Dmode.\n\nThis is also the last concert run with Alan Wilder before he left the chaos of the band. Many people credit him with helping Depeche reach the highs that they did.\n\nAll of the songs on this concert are from the Song of Faith and Devotion album. Don&apos;t go looking for the biggest hits.\n\nIf you are looking fo an amazing sonic experience to match beautiful imagery (Anton Corbjin) then sit in with a drink or a smoke and enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "I wish Sebastien Lipshitz would make more films. Of all the French directors during the past decades who have broken the French ( hidden ) taboo on making same sex films he is the best. Techine is variable. Christophe Honore equally so and Ozon fluctuates. But Lipshitz in his clear and unsentimental way has made a handful of films that take top place in my collection. I remember seeing &apos; Les Invisibles &apos; in a small cinema near the Bastille area in 2012. Despite the onset of food poisoning due to some bad food I watched the film with a sense of sorrow, anger and tenderness. This was my generation up there on the screen, and being young in Paris in the 1960&apos;s was, despite its joys a place of pain. Young men ( I cannot speak for women ) were either bisexual or openly defiant in their open acceptance of their sexuality, but most sadly either married or hated themselves. In culture you either had Jean Genet on one side or the closet literature of Julien Green or Francois Mauriac on the other. There were lots of gay novels, some very good, some horrifically self-hating. Contempt or a tepid tolerance was the best a gay man could expect, and every gay reference in a film was held like a gem in one&apos;s hand. As for the so-called New Wave it never flowed over Gay themes, and I look back in anger at them for that. Catholicism and Communism joined a united front against us, and between Godard and the terrible films of Lelouch there was no representation. Then as the 21st century got into its stride out stepped a handful of people who made our lives a source of interest and here, I repeat Lipshitz as, and is, the best of all of them. And &apos; Les Invisibles &apos; was a quiet indictment of those heteronormative values of French society, and although he does not mention it the culture of film and literature of those days. I hope they may never return, but the spectacle of horror against Gay marriage in France was a warning not to be ignored.",

Der Todesking, however, is far from being any sort of video nasty. Rather, it is a brooding, raw, brutally frank art-house hysteria punctuated by avantgarde delivery, particularly the recurring interludes of a decomposing corpse. There is also a spoof on &quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,&quot; which is weird and totally unexpected if you consider Buttgereit&apos;s nationality. In any case, utterly depressing, plodding atmosphere and unnerving lack of dialogue bring this work even further into the category of obscure cult classics, not for the weak of heart or mind. But would you expect anything less from the man who gave us &quot;Nekromantik,&quot; &quot;Schramm,&quot; &quot;Hot Love?&quot; Indeed. &quot;This is the Death King. He makes it so that people don&apos;t want to live anymore.&quot; Can YOU look him in the eyes?"

Compare this with the mannered, almost sedate way such combats are choreographed in the works of, say, Kurosawa.",

There are no complicated gimmicks or special effects, but it exemplifies the best traits of human beings; optimism, good humor, romantic love, and the kind of respect that a decent human being would show, in all of their relationships. If anything, it would be nice if we could seriously ponder these values as being worthy, instead of dismissing them, as being old fashion or downright sappy. Hedy was the personification of regal elegance, but with a warm heart; Robert Walker, was very likable and funny; June Allyson, Rags Ragland, were as warmly effective as the two leads. A very positive and sensitive film. Too bad these qualities make this a &apos;chick flick&apos; in today&apos;s world. I know there was a time, when a family could enjoy a movie like this, without feeling weird, because their adrenaline drives were not being satisfied by glorified violence, and a general disrespect for anything decent or human.",

(His character was not developed, but the three brothers&apos; relationship to him made him a central figure.) That there is something dysfunctional within the film could be inferred from the title, but that does not imply anything interesting nor worthwhile in the film. Happily, it is interesting and fascinating.\n\nI don&apos;t know if all dysfunctional families are interesting, but this one certainly is. Possibly, it is because the characters are so well developed that we can empathize with them. All in all - quite enjoyable.",

Mark (Mohr) is dying of AIDS, and spends his last week on earth in a Chicago hospital talking to his mother (Burstyn). Hugh (Quaid) gets drunk and tells tragic stories to women in bars. Trendy, philosophical Joan (Jolie) tries to date the reclusive, mysterious Keenan (Phillippe), who refuses to date. Meredith (Anderson) has been &quot;scalded&quot; by so many men that she is afraid to get too close to Trent (Stewart). And Gracie and Roger (Stowe and Edwards) have an affair in an LA hotel; he wants more while she doesn&apos;t.\n\nThe stories seem independent, and I spent the whole movie wondering how they all intertwine. (They all come together in the last 20 minutes.) Not much plot, but the characters are very well developed, the acting is superb, and life&apos;s humor and tragedy is well mixed.\n\nRated R for language and mature content, but it probably could have gotten away with a PG13.",

The acting is far from great and the special effects kind of suck, but when you are dealing with a low budget direct to video kind of movie, you almost expect this. It&apos;s one of those kind of movies that you see on cable at like 2am and just sort of fall into the storyline and just get a fun funky ride. I think if you like Buffy, The Craft and other teen angst/special powers stuff, you&apos;ll get a get out of this movie. It really reminded me of a story that would make a great comic book premise or a great tv series if handled by good writers. If you are a fan of comic books and interesting origin of powers stories I think that you can make certain parrallels between this story and comic books like The Fantastic Four or maybe even Power Pack. I also like the idea of how this film deals with the realistic elements of how teens in high school might deal with getting special powers. These kids aren&apos;t out to save the world or use their powers for good. Far from it. Anyone that was ever picked on by a bully has had some kind of revenge fantasy and this movie shows how teens with an axe to grind might use their powers for revenge and power as opposed to making the world a better place. If you had special powers and the ability to make yourself a god, would you? Could you resist the temptation to take revenge? This film is not going to get nominated for any awards, nor would I suggest renting it if you are over the age of 20, but if you see it&apos;s on cable, check it out. struggle through the first 20 minutes or so, and I think you&apos;ll have a fun ride."

I have always considered his white rapper character, Brad Gluckman, to be one of my favorites, and always felt he didn&apos;t portray Brad, or `B-Rad,&apos; nearly enough as he should.\n\nI was very pleased with how the movie turned out.  It was a refreshing escape from the all-too-common war movies and horror-dramas of late.  You can&apos;t help but feel for the confused white rapper who thinks his rhymes are &apos;the shiznit&apos; and that he&apos;s just as &apos;down&apos; as anyone else he may encounter on the other side of the tracks.\n\nIf I could give it stars, I&apos;d give it five out of 5.  On a scale from one to ten, with ten being best, I&apos;d give it a 10.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.\n\nGo see &quot;Malibu&apos;s Most Wanted&quot; if you&apos;re in the mood for a light-hearted, authentic comedy.\n\nAnd to all of those who haven&apos;t accepted &quot;Malibu&apos;s Most Wanted&quot; as an awesome movie... Don&apos;t be hatin&apos;!"

      "reviewBody": "Although I&apos;m sure there are many parents who would shudder at the thought of sitting down to watch The Spongebob Squarepants Movie, I was actually looking forward to it: it may be a far cry from the Disney and Hanna-Barbera fodder I was raised on, but I love the surreal and &apos;anything goes&apos; vibe of the TV programme and was keen to see the feature length version.\n\nThe story centres around Spongebob&apos;s attempt to retrieve King Neptune&apos;s stolen crown, in order to save the life of his boss, Mr. Krabs, who has been framed for the crime. Together with his friend Patrick, Spongebob travels to Shell City to find the crown and save the day.\n\nSpongebob is a well-meaning character who I find it impossible not to like, and although perhaps the format is stretched a tad too far for an hour-and-a-half long film, there is still plenty to enjoy about this fun packed feature (let&apos;s face it¬óany film that sees a climactic fight take place on David Hasselhoff&apos;s butt, and a sponge defeat evil via the power of rock &apos;n&apos; roll, has got to be worth seeing!).\n\nThe Spongebob Squarepants Movie may not win any new fans, but those who think that the TV show is genius should definitely give this one a whirl.",

It&apos;s the perfect new year movie, that gives you hope for the year to come and live everyday fully. The variety of characters is okay, as you get to know them enough to see a little bit of yourself in them or not,and it&apos;s really interesting to see what different people go through at that time of the year and how they feel and what they hope to change. It really is a warm,hopeful movie, at least that&apos;s the way I saw it.Sometimes we need to take a break and take a deep breath, that&apos;s the movie.",

Welcome to the newspaper racket!\n\nAllan Dwan directs this 20th Century-Fox B at a high speed, with most of the humor in the mysogynistic way Dinehart operates. Donleavy is hard-boiled and not a wisecracker, and Miss revor is akll at sea, but learns fast. There are some nice twists, and a good supporting cast including Ralph Morgan, Rita Hayworth as a nightclub dancer, and Herman Bing. Sol Wurtzel wound up in charge of the B studio after the merger. No one liked him, but he had a good pool of performers and technicians. Thanks to the new corporate structure, he had access to good writers -- finally-- and didn&apos;t have to play office politics This is one of the movies that, in this period, made Fox the best B studio among the majors.

      "reviewBody": "Writer/director Andr√© T√©chin√© (Wild Reeds, My Favorite Season, Child of the Night, etc) is able to take what appear to be simple emotional responses from complicated people and create an artwork that makes us think, become introspective, and be challenged and entertained all at the same time. His ability to draw intensely personal performances from his actors makes him a director with a full heart and startling technique.\n\nEssentially a love story, &apos;Les Temps qui changent&apos; (&apos;Changing Times&apos;) examines the lives of two people who fell in love in Paris 30 years ago, but parted. Antoine Lavau (G√©rard Depardieu) has never married, so in love with his original flame C√©cile (Catherine Deneuve) that he is obsessed with winning her back. C√©cile has married a younger man, Natan (Gilbert Melki) who is a philandering physician, and lives in Tangiers where she hosts a dowdy talk show on the radio to help support the family. The couple has a bisexual son Sami (Malik Zidi), who has returned to Tangiers with his drug-addled girlfriend Nadia (Lubna Azabal) and her son Sa√Ød (Idir Elomri) much to his parent&apos;s concern, and takes up with his Moroccan lover Bilal (Nadem Rachati). The family problems are further complicated by the fact that the Morroccan Nadia has a twin sister A√Øcha (also played by Lubna Azabal) in Tangiers who is trying desperately to separate her life from her twin.\n\nAntoine, an architect of means, manages to land a job in Tangiers in hopes of rekindling his romance with C√©cile, but C√©cile has become a feminist and a bitter woman who resents her younger husband&apos;s infidelity and wants nothing to do with love, especially with the threat of depth of feeling that Antoine&apos;s new presence in her world presents. Antoine is persistent, meets C√©cile&apos;s husband for medical reasons, and tries to woo C√©cile in a close to stalking manner. C√©cile&apos;s best friend Rachel (Tanya Lopert) convinces her that the only way to end the ardor of Antoine is to sleep with him, which she finally does with unexpected results. While the dance between C√©cile and Antoine progresses, Natan meets A√Øcha, Sami and Bilal arouse old emotions, and Nadia requires rehab for her out of control drug habits. How all of these coincidental occurrences coincide in an unexpected accident for Antoine is Andr√© T√©chin√©&apos;s magical way of sharing the power of love in the most adverse of circumstances. The ending is surprising and thought-provoking and eminently satisfying.\n\nDepardieu and Deneuve are luminous in their roles, adding yet other crowns to their careers of creating unforgettable, subtle characterizations on film. The remainder of the cast is also superb and the cinematography and music and editing and direction make this a feast for the eyes and the brain. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",

Barrack - all of whom had a hand in the Bonus Features for this incredible new  DVD set. Wherever a reason, whatever the season, Bruce and his friends for decades, with familiar names like Malcolm and Mert, along with the new breed of riders, taking the sport to the extreme, can conjure up stories and tales of how they √Ç‚Äúalmost made it, jumped it, ate it, killed it or trashed it√Ç‚Äù on practically every Sunday.",

      "reviewBody": "I have not read Cooper&apos;s original novel, I will freely admit, nor do I ever really see myself working up the interest to actually do so. But I absolutely love this version of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;. It was the first movie I ever saw in the widescreen format of video tapes and, after watching it again after about three years of not seeing it, everything I loved about it then still holds true.\n\nThe film is no more anti-British than it is anti-Indian. Everybody gets a more or less fair shake. Granted, Day-Lewis and his adopted family (as well as the Munro sisters) get have more to like about them than some of the others, but even the &quot;bad guys&quot; are understandable. Think about it: Maghoa is, without a doubt, a bloodthirsty, hate-driven b*****d, yet considering all he&apos;s lost in his life thanks to the Yanquis (particularly Colonel Munro), can you blame him for wanting to take his revenge? I can&apos;t. Colonel Munro is a loving father who cares very deeply about his daughters and a commander who cares about his men. Still, the atrocities he&apos;s committed in the name of the Crown against Maghoa are disconcerting, to say the least. Horrible though his death is, can one truly say whether or not it is unjustified? I can&apos;t. Major Duncan Heyward is an arrogant snob of an English officer, looking down his nose at colonials and Indians alike. But he is no fop in combat, as his reaction to the George Road ambush proved, and, as he proved with his death, under that arrogant exterior is a very brave man. Can anyone say that he truly deserved his fate? I can&apos;t.\n\nThe thing, to me, that makes this a great film is that, when all&apos;s said and done, nobody wins. NOBODY. Of all the eight major characters (Hawkeye, Chingachook, Uncas, Cora Munro, Alice Munro, Colonel Munro, Maghoa, Maj. Heyward), half of them are dead by film&apos;s end and everyone has lost at one person they very deeply care about. There&apos;s no overarcing evil responsible for these horrors, just human nature, culture clashs, and the insanity that is war. As America today is still very much a country of clashing cultures fighting for supremacy, therein lies the great tragedy of &quot;Last of The Mohicans&quot;. 243 years later, we still haven&apos;t learned a thing...and we&apos;d better."

      "reviewBody": "Inspired by Re-Animator this is a short hard core porno movie with more gore and blood than your average slasher. Totally gross, would probably be the modern phrase best apt for this but it certainly is a little different. At times it resembles those live action happenings of the late 60&apos;s with Otto Meurle, and now and again even the Japanese Guinea Pig films. The big surprise is that this is just 22 minutes and after the Re-Animator look beginning the two get down to some decent sex routines BUT with blood spurting all the time. More than a little disconcerting at first, especially with the blow job when there seems to be so much blood about, we gradually just about get used to the unusual mix of hard core sex and blood and it remains a turn on despite everything, party due to the obvious enthusiasm of the participants. As well as the aforementioned &apos;Director&apos;s Cut&apos; there is a tighter 11 minutes &apos;Screening Cut&apos; and a fair amount of extras including interesting commentaries, one from the two &apos;actors&apos; and one from director and camera man. Both commentaries accompany the &apos;Director&apos;s Cut&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "I rarely watch Chinese films because most of the ones I saw were exaggerated, too much CG effects but less storyline. This one is one of the few I&apos;d watched and enjoyed, even made it as one of my Hall of Fame movies. Only less than hundred out of tens of thousands of movies I ever watched made it to the Hall of Fame; most are Hollywood movies; the rest are Japanese, Korean, British and French movies.\n\nThe movie is about hardworking mute girl and lazy lunch-box delivery boy. The girl had no extra time to play around because she had to earn the money to support her mute sister, a Paralympic swimmer. On the other hand, the boy had so much time to fool around &apos;cuz he&apos;s the pampered child of a restaurant owner parents. Most of the time, I thought I&apos;m watching a silent film because most of the scenes were hand gesture conversation. I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s boring but very interesting because this is my first time for this type of movie. There&apos;s a plot twist near the end and you&apos;ll be surprised by that. That&apos;s why I won&apos;t spoiled it anymore.\n\nI&apos;ll just express my feelings in number and recommend some of my favorite movies. My rating systems are purely based on the overall feeling of the entire movie and just for expressing emotion numerically in a set format.\n\nFirst Impression: Impressive {FI = 1/1}\n\nStoryline {S = 2.5/3}; Logical Point of View: Expressive (LPV = 1/1), Moral Point of View: Ethical (MPV = 0.5/1), Sequence: Thrilling (Sq = 1/1)\n\nCharacters &amp; Chemistry {C&amp;C = 3/4}; Chemistry between Lead Casts : Sparks fly (CLC = 2/2), Supporting Effect: Supportive (SE = 1/1)\n\nExpectation &amp; Reality: Unexpected {E&amp;R = 1/1}\n\nLast Impact: Satisfied {LI = 1-/1}\n\nTotal Point = 8.5-/10, Bonus Point: Music &amp; Originality {BP = 0.5/0.5+}, Deduction Point: None {DP = 0/2}\n\nGrand Total = 9- *Unique*\n\nMovie Suggestion by:\n\n~ Film Genre ~ The Choice (2016) {Dra-Rom} ~ 8.5, Finding You (2020) {Dra-Rom} ~ 8.5, Miracle: Letters to the President (2021) {Dra} ~ 8.5+\n\n~ Point ~ Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow (1963) ~ 9-, Armageddon (1998) ~ 9-, The Parent Trap (1998) ~ 9-\n\n*** You can check my uncut reviews and favorite movie lists by visiting my profile.

(Roger Moore would play the title character in the very successful TV Series in the 1960s). Sanders, with his quick, proper British accent, is probably best known for his roles in &quot;All About Eve&quot;, or &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Good story, but WHY do they keep taking the valuables that everyone is after out of the hotel safe ?? It gets a little confusing later in the story on who actually has the coveted valuables, but maybe that&apos;s part of the mystery. Also some competition over Templar on the parts of Elna Johnson (Wendy Barrie) and Margaret Forbes (Linda Hayes). It would be interesting to know if ANY of it were filmed in the Palm Springs area, as there is liberal use of stills and backdrops. Pretty good story, some clever scriptwriting, but the ending is a little silly. --- note that many of the actors in the background were also used in &quot;The Falcon&quot; films, another Sanders mystery murder series from RKO.",

      "reviewBody": "I greatly admired the previous films by Susanne Bier (&quot; Open Hearts&quot; and &quot;Brothers&quot;), so my expectations were very high.Luckily they have been fulfilled.Like the other two the film is a sociological and emotional experiment.It&apos;s about one&apos;s place in the world (the crucial phrase in the film is Jorgen&apos;s &quot;Can one expect from you help only on the other side of the globe&quot; ), about responsibility and the making of painful decisions.The film starts quite slow,but after half an hour it&apos;s getting more intensive,mostly supported by 4 extraordinary actors and actresses.While I already knew the qualities of Mikkelsen,Knudsen and Lassgard,I was really blown away by Fischer Christensen as the daughter.There were 4 real-life characters and I could follow their psychological turmoil.Some may find the script too constructed,but life turns out to be full of unexpected twists.The film is no popcorn-entertainment,but for anyone,who appreciates a human,deeply moving drama with the concentration on the characters instead of superficial action,I can only say: Go and watch this movie!",

However it all goes downhill from there. There are many silly twists, characters that just don&apos;t fit and situations that are completely unbelievable. The film was obviously made on a tight budget and it shows. Nothing seems even remotely real.\n\nThe director has made a number of animal movies in the past, specifically the MVP (Most Valuable Primate) and Airbud movies. This is easily his worst yet.\n\nSave your money and go see ANY other kids movie.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Biraj Bahu&quot; is an adaptation of Bengali novelist Sharat Chandra Chattopadhya&apos;s literary work with the same name, directed by one of the pioneer directors of Indian Cinema, Bimal Roy, following his superb adaptation of Sarat Chandra&apos;s another novel &quot;Parineeta.&quot; Set under the rural backdrop of an Indian village, the film reflects the social milieu of the time through its impeccable character development emanating a heart felt story with just brilliantly realized and inane situations.\n\nDespite the film takes few liberties from the original literary work, the film sumptuously makes the central character of the novel, Biraj, a beautiful and devout wife who wishes to die in her husband&apos;s feet, glow. Through the turmoil and social outrage, her commitment towards her husband is in-dettered, which just gets brilliantly executed through a heart rending roles or a finely nuanced script. May that be the brilliant performances from Kamini Kaushal or Abhi Bhattacharya, or its poignant story, the film is a rare gem, from a remarkable and a pioneer film-maker, which recreates the rich literary work on the screen.\n\nRating: 5 stars out of 5",

      "reviewBody": "If you think Ed Wood&apos;s &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; can&apos;t be beaten, think again. I dare say this in the only movie in movie history that gets close to Wood&apos;s achievement. It&apos;s so bad it&apos;s unique. Being a movie-addicted Brazilian, I have to say that this is by far the worst Brazilian movie ever made! The story, about a big-butted Brazilian dancer who becomes a celebrity, is probably the worst screenplay ever written too. The acting is hilarious: Carla Parez, the previously mentioned big-butted dancer has got to be the worst actress in my country&apos;s history. Technically speaking, this movie gets really close to Wood&apos;s achievement too. I know it&apos;s almost impossible to find it now, but I really think you should try. If you like &quot;so-bad-they&apos;re-good&quot; movies, try this one. I think you won&apos;t find anything better at it than this one!",

      "name": "BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1955) - DVD Review",
      "reviewBody": "Yesterday I have watched Jean-Pierre Melville&apos;s BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1955) for the first time, by way of Criterion&apos;s exemplary DVD edition. The film is a typical 50s French noir in its presentation of divided loyalties among a gang of crooks, women causing trouble, an elaborate heist-gone-wrong, police interrogation, etc. With this, Melville&apos;s first outing in a genre he later made his own, the director shows he is already at one with the milieu, capturing its every nuance and mannerism with almost effortless ease.\n\nThe cast is relatively low-key but all the main roles are admirably filled. Unfortunately, none went on to do much else of importance (apart from Howard Vernon) - and it was, in fact, lead actor Roger Duchesne&apos;s penultimate film. Looking a bit like Rudolf Klein-Rogge (who as Dr. Mabuse also played a gambling crime lord), he exudes a smooth charisma and is quite arresting in his playing. Isabel Corey, still a teenager but looking incredibly sexy and mature, was literally hand-picked by Melville himself for the role of Anne, the lovely waif whom Bob takes under his wing but whose inexperience eventually leads, in part, to his downfall. The film also makes brief yet subtle use of nudity which, at that time, was not something one would hope to find in American movies! Daniel Cauchy as Paulo, Bob&apos;s right-hand man who also falls for Corey, acquits himself well too here and, on the DVD, delivers an intelligent and delightful 20-minute interview which gives some insight into Melville&apos;s working methods, the film&apos;s pain-staking shooting schedule (it took some two years to complete during which time Cauchy found time to appear in another four movies!) and also the director&apos;s insistence in portraying the &apos;correct&apos; way of dying on screen. Howard Vernon has a brief but pivotal role as the shady Scotsman who offers to finance Bob&apos;s &apos;scheme&apos;.\n\nApart from the usual conventions of typical French crime dramas, BOB LE FLAMBEUR introduces some new forms of technique which anticipated the off-the-cuff style of the Nouvelle Vague by some years: the editing has a strange, almost disjointed rhythm to it which is particularly felt near the end during the long gambling sequence at the casino; the hand-held camera-work lends it a slightly amateurish look which suits the mood perfectly; a vaguely avant-gardist touch is also evident in the set design, as in the domino-styled walls of the gambling-dens Bob frequents and the closet in his apartment that is fitted with a privately-owned slot machine! Another interesting aspect (derived perhaps from Julien Duvivier&apos;s PEPE&apos; LE MOKO [1936]) is the mutual admiration that is present between Bob and the Police Inspector played by Guy Decomble.\n\nUnlike most of Melville&apos;s other work, and particularly his film noirs, the gloomy &apos;atmosphere&apos; is here counter-pointed by a deft playful mood that makes the film extremely enjoyable despite its fairly slow pace. The film&apos;s conclusion then, improbable as it may seem, provides a perfect and deliciously ironic twist - complete with a wonderful closing line.\n\nCriterion&apos;s DVD also includes a rather vague radio interview, conducted in English in 1961, with Jean-Pierre Melville who is made distinctly uneasy by interviewer Gideon Bachmann&apos;s frustratingly opaque questions. We learn, however, of Melville&apos;s great love of American cinema as well as his own work&apos;s belated but well-deserved international recognition. I have now watched 8 of Melville&apos;s films - LES ENFANTS TERRIBLES (1950); BOB LE FLAMBEUR; LEON MORIN, PRETRE (1961 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); LE DOULOS (1962 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); L&apos; AINE&apos; DES FERCHEAUX (1963); LE SAMOURAI (1967); L&apos; ARMEE&apos; DES OMBRES (1969 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); and UN FLIC (1972 - I still haven&apos;t gotten round to purchasing the Anchor Bay R1 DVD). I haven&apos;t yet watched LE CERCLE ROUGE (1970 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion) which I own on VHS, but I may just check it out now that I&apos;m in the mood for more Melville movies!"

      "reviewBody": "When you break it down and look at it both honestly and cynically (assuming that that is possible for a minute), there are really only two kinds of war movie: pro and con. The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the &apos;value&apos; of war, of its worth. It&apos;s pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?\n\nPro or con?\n\nWhat is interesting is that since the Second World War, this underlying message that is found in nearly all war pictures has slowly changed from the former to the latter. This again is generally shaped in two ways. Either we see the play-by-play results following the issuance of what appears to be a bizarre and foolhardy set of orders from high command (i.e., APOCALYPSE NOW or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). Or we get a glimpse of being right in the action as it all falls apart: hearing the bullets whizzing past our noses, reeling from the impact of RPG&apos;s and gazing blankly as the bodies begin to mount (PLATOON, say). BLACK HAWK DOWN, directed by Ridley Scott and accurately following the true story of the best-selling book by Mark Bowden, very much adopts the latter perspective.\n\nOn October 3, 1993, a small unit of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force troops were dropped by helicopter into hostile territory in Mogadishu, Somalia, with what is perceived to be a straightforward mission: the capture of two lieutenants of the Somali warlord, General Aidid. The unit is under command from Major William Garrison (Sam Shepard), and headed by Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) in his first direct experience of frontline leadership. He also has a personal goal - to ensure everyone comes back alive.\n\nYet, these things are never as easy as they appear - hence the development of the book and the film - and when 18-year old frontline rookie Todd Blackbird is injured early on, the entire mission begins to fall apart. More U.S. troops are injured, and when Somalis down two Black Hawk helicopters, the mission changes completely: it&apos;s now a rescue operation.\n\nAnd for about ninety minutes, you are subjected to some of the most intense, disturbing, graphic, violent and chilling pieces of conflict representation that you will ever see. Remember the Omaha Beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? That was about half an hour long. Think of something three times that length, yet more &apos;realistic&apos; and with (thankfully) no flag-waving. That is the gist of BLACK HAWK DOWN.\n\nUltimately, one hundred-and-twenty-three U.S. troops were involved in the Mogadishu conflict. Nineteen were killed, and one thousand Somalis also perished.\n\nUnlike RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN doesn&apos;t build up a core group of characters, focusing on their emotional makeup and depth. No. Instead, we barely know our &apos;heroes&apos;, with very little time devoted to each characters motivation or purpose. And this is a good thing. At first, you find yourself a little bewildered by the sizeable cast, and this isn&apos;t helped by the many distant POV scenes that found this reviewer wondering just who he was seeing living and dying. But surely that is an important and crucial element of war - you&apos;re involved in these suicidal missions with men you barely know. You don&apos;t have time to share your life-stories. You may have only met that week, that day, or within the last hour. And then it&apos;s full on.\n\nWe get snippets of character data: Eversmann&apos;s entire focus is on not letting the team down; Specialist Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), for so long tied to his desk simply because he excelled at typing; and Delta Sergeant &apos;Hoot&apos; Hooten (Tom Sizemore, soon to be playing Bruce Banner in THE HULK), wise despite his years, somehow making more sense of the nonsense than anyone else.\n\nBut any characterisation is underplayed and to the point, which is how it should be. The fresh-facedness and naivety of the troops is key to the success of the film, and of the emotional impact therein. As the errors and bodies mount, we get to see the horror of the conflict - the carnage and devastation, relentlessness and never-ending waves of Somali forces - directly through the eyes of the U.S. Rangers and Delta Force squad. I was somewhat stunned by the impact of the movie, both in the way the action grips you and shakes you violently until you want to let go, and in the occasional and very touching soft moments. Indeed, the action is so intense that I found myself at times glazing over, thinking of something else, and with hindsight I put this down to some kind of need for an emotional release; certainly, I cannot fault the film in that sense. It was simply a case of &apos;too much.&apos;\n\nThroughout the movie both the acting and direction are superb; Ridley Scott has an eye for detail and filmography that is probably unmatched. Even his lesser efforts like HANNIBAL are beautifully shot. And BLACK HAWK DOWN is one of his best efforts to date.\n\nThe musical score is also superb, and I was encouraged to hear the Stone Temple Pilot&apos;s CREEP near the beginning of the flick. I believe this is the first time I have heard a STP song in any movie.\n\nWhat is also very welcome is the lack of U.S. nationalism in this picture. Of America saving the day. Unlike, say, brother Tony Scott&apos;s TOP GUN - which yes, was making a different point entirely (i.e., let&apos;s make some money and recruit some boys to the Navy at the same time) - this isn&apos;t about the might of the U.S. There is no wake-leaving in BLACK HAWK DOWN. Real people made mistakes, and real people died.\n\nSpeaking of Tony Scott, however, my only minor quibble was Sam Shepard&apos;s performance. He was probably in the wrong movie, as all his mannerisms (especially the way he took off his sunglasses in that quick-draw kind of way that stereotypical military types always seem to do) appeared to me to come straight out of TOP GUN. He was a little too &apos;bleh&apos; for my tastes. For all I know William Garrison could have been exactly like that, but it still seemed a little Hollywood.\n\nI also wasn&apos;t completely comfortable as to how the Somalis were portrayed; this movie wasn&apos;t really about good versus bad in my opinion, but on the face of it the U.S. are the bad guys here. At least inasmuch as they were at fault. Comparisons are made with Vietnam both in the unnecessary involvement of the U.S. in the Somali civil war, and in the end credits of the film where we learn that the Medal of Honour was awarded to two U.S. soldiers for the first time since the Vietnam conflict. Yet, throughout the film the Somali are seen in only two ways - either a relentless force of bloodthirsty killers, or a simple people trying to stay out of the way. Now yes, this may be what it really was like - I cannot say because I wasn&apos;t there - but the overall message didn&apos;t fit well with me. They seemed too one-dimensional, a bit TOO bloodthirsty, and that left a bitter taste.\n\nAlso as mentioned above the film is often confusing during the extended battle scene, and warrants more than one view. As the blood and dirt begins to pile, you will find yourself wondering who you are looking at, particularly when the perspective is on several soldiers from a distance. But that can be forgiven. This isn&apos;t PREDATOR, and while that film is outstanding as a piece of science fiction, it made a great effort to separate the marines so that the viewer would have an easy time following each one.\n\nThat, of course, isn&apos;t real life, and BLACK HAWK DOWN is, perhaps, as close as we&apos;ve come yet to an accurate capture of the true feel of war.\n\nRating: **** 1/2 (out of five)"

The plot won&apos;t win any literary prizes, the gags are little better than average, but the comic timing of Funes, Lefebvre, Galabru, etc. is brilliant, study material for acting school. This is very much a feel-good slapstick comedy with the usual towering central performance of Louis de Funes in the title role, a prime example of a central character carrying a movie.\n\nThe best bit of the film is the black-and-white pre-credit opening sequence, set before Cruchot&apos;s move to St.Tropez.  The scene with the chicken-thief and the choir is priceless.",

He was aided by that great pair - Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (lovely as usual!) who kept the interest all the way through. The supporting cast was really star-studded, with Donald Crisp, Henry Stephenson, Nigel Bruce and Spring Byington, and in a very early role in his career, David Niven. If you had to pinpoint a weak link, it was Patric Knowles as Flynn&apos;s brother. But all that aside, it is a couple of hours of excitement and sheer entertainment while waiting for the Charge and what is going to happen to the nasty Surat Khan!! The remakes since, while having the benefits of far greater technical tools, falls way short of this epic.",

      "reviewBody": "Marco Ferreri&apos;s surreal film &quot;Il seme dell&apos;uomo&quot; (&quot;The Seed of Man&quot; in English) looks more plausible today than it probably did when it first came out. The movie portrays a young man and woman who, after learning of a plague ravaging the populace, take refuge in a house on the coast and turn it into a miniature museum displaying cultural relics from the days before the plague. But that&apos;s not the end...\n\nAn interesting point is that the movie never identifies what the plague in question is specifically. It could be any scourge. Certainly plenty of bad things have afflicted the planet recently - the combination of global warming and the financial crisis constitutes a perfect storm - to the point that the events portrayed in this movie look as though they could come true. I bet that Marco Ferreri never realized what a prescient movie he was making! \n\nSo, I recommend this. Not just as a warning about what the world could turn into, but as a look at Italy&apos;s changing cinema in the late &apos;60s (in which Ferreri played a major role). Definitely worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "BROTHER OUTLAW is a solid if unspectacular addition to the spaghetti western genre, directed by Eoardo Mulargia, who previously made DON&apos;T WAIT, DJANGO...SHOOT! amongst many other entries in the genre. Thankfully it&apos;s much better than the aforementioned film, thanks to a well-paced narrative, plenty of well-directed action, and an interesting plot. It&apos;s clear that Mulargia learnt plenty since that earlier western he shot.\n\nThe good-looking Tony Kendall plays Dakota, the Sheriff of a small town assailed by bank robbers. This dastardly criminal gang successfully manage to pin the blame for their latest crime on the sheriff, whom is promptly shipped off to a hard labour camp for x amount of years. Thankfully for him his brother is a real outlaw and breaks him out of the camp so that the pair can track down and bring justice to the real culprits.\n\nThis is an affectionately-made western with all the usual tropes of the genre: the opening stage coach chase (which goes on for about ten minutes but feels like an hour), the hero getting captured and beaten and escaping, lots of duels, shoot-outs and people getting shot off horses, plus some very nice location photography with Italian landscapes standing in for the Old West. Kendall was always an adept hero and he&apos;s well supported by a game cast. BROTHER OUTLAW is no classic but it&apos;s certainly an entertaining enough entry in a crowded genre.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the very first of the all-star, no-plot revues that proliferated during 1929 and 1930. Just about every star at Metro is featured, and there are many fun sequences to be savored in this film. The most famous one is probably the Joan Crawford segment, where she sings and dances to &quot;Gotta Feeling For You&quot;. Her singing is passable, and her dancing is, well, &quot;energetic&quot;. Marion Davies seems quite nervous in her &quot;Tommy Atkins On Parade&quot; number, but Bessie Love is pretty good in her wild acrobatics. Marie Dressler is fun, as always, and you can glimpse Carla Laemmle as the pearl in the oyster during &quot;Tableau Of Jewels&quot;, which opens the second half. John Gilbert&apos;s speaking voice dosen&apos;t sound nearly as bad as had been rumored, even when considering the antiquity of the recording. The &quot;Singin&apos; In The Rain&quot; number is fun, and offers a good contrast to the more famous one in the film of the same name. There are some special effects and two-color Technicolor that must have wowed the audiences back then, and it&apos;s been said that during the premiere, the theater put a gallon or so of orange-scented perfume into the ventilators during the &quot;Orange Blossom Time&quot; finale. In all, this film is well worth a look if you are into early sound films of historical value."

I don&apos;t know how much it is like the book, but I liked the ideas the film was based on, the graphics were nice, and it was a new twist on an old storyline (the kids did a really good job acting too). Some people complain it didn&apos;t have any action and they &quot;fell asleep&quot; - well it&apos;s not an action movie, and honestly if you fall asleep, either you&apos;re really overworked or you&apos;re just not into light mystery and philosophical ideas. It definitely has a &quot;new age&quot; touch, it&apos;s mysterious, and with a nice bit of surreal/sci-fi - if you liked movies the same pace and style as K-Pax (though this one is a bit more geared towards kids), then you&apos;ll probably like Mimzy. I wouldn&apos;t suggest really young kids for this one, they might not understand a lot of it - 10 and up would probably enjoy it more.\n\nAlso, the less you know about the movie, the more you&apos;ll like it. Don&apos;t spend a day reading reviews and looking at trailers. Grab your kids, go to the theater, and see it for yourself with a fresh mind. You&apos;ll probably enjoy it as much as I did. :)",

As the story of newly trained UXO Laos personnel unfolds, we observe people work, eat, and drink: these are the real people whose lives have been inevitably and irreversibly affected by the appalling bombing campaign of 1964-1973. We see faces, not numbers. \n\nThe music score is mesmerizing, camera-work appears flawless, and editing could be only applauded. \n\nGood documentaries inform you while great documentaries also leave you with a feeling. &quot;Bomb Harvest&quot; falls into the second category and hence shouldn&apos;t be missed.",

That&apos;s a point I&apos;d like to stress because there is a certain audience I think will appreciate this film but who may not give it a chance because they expect graphic nastiness. Against the film&apos;s interests, the marketing tries to sell the film to the cheap horror-movie audience and I think this is a pity.\n\nInstead of depicting violence, Jacobson&apos;s film discomforts you using dramatic means - principally writing and acting. All of which are used with enough skill to distinguish the film from cheap horror movies. It would be wrong and unfair to dismiss Dahmer because of its packaging. It is a well-written and performed character drama.\n\nIt&apos;s subject matter is too horrible for the general drama audience to welcome, but at the same time its serious approach makes it too straight for the entertainment market. By that I mean the Hannibal Lecter/Seven audience, who prefer their serial killer tales abstracted (and therefore made safe) by the presence of movie stars.\n\nDahmer is more akin to Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer in being low budget, filled with unfamiliar faces, and focussed so much on the killer that there is no awareness of the authorities or justice in the story. There is no hero cop or FBI agent in pursuit.\n\nDahmer is very unlike McNaughton&apos;s infamous film because, as already mentioned, it&apos;s low on violence, but also because it&apos;s a technically better-executed piece of work. The photography and editing, the use of music, the already-mentioned acting and writing, make this a surprisingly good-quality film considering the expectations stacked against it. One technical achievement I find worth noting is how well it recreates period. Sequences set in the 80&apos;s have a visual authenticity that puts big budget studio attempts to shame.\n\nObviously, you know what kind of film you like. If what I&apos;ve said above sounds interesting to you, then I recommend giving it a look. I repeat that you will not see much in the way of gore or violence. There are plenty of films with more graphic content dressed more commercially. Dahmer won&apos;t make you feel good. It isn&apos;t a fun movie. But if you are looking for something with more substance you may find it."

Upon receiving a bite from a Brown Recluse spider, Mathis winds up in the hospital. While he&apos;s there, by some unholy happenstance, another species of spider, a particularly large specimen, crawls forth. In seconds, the angry arachnid is on a deadly rampage!\n\nIf that&apos;s not bad enough, the military shows up, led by Maj. Tanner (Ray Wise), to &quot;take care of things&quot;. The hospital is quickly locked down, and it&apos;s obvious that this is no ordinary spider. Can Mathis use his bug-killing skills to assist in the eradication of this fast-growing monster?\n\nGrunberg is fantastic in his nebbish cum hero role. The movie is an excellent blend of sci-fi horror / creature feature and comedy. Not as hopelessly &quot;zany&quot; as one might expect, it benefits from well-written humor. The CGI isn&apos;t bad, especially later in the movie, when the BAS goes &quot;KING KONG&quot;.\n\nA low budget film that makes the best of its limited funds..."

      "reviewBody": "A significant number of reviews I have read regarding Ghost World complain about &quot;nothing&quot; happening.  This is simply untrue.  Having read the book by Daniel Clowes and being sceptical and admiring of it in roughly equal measure, I was very pleased to see the film far surpassed the book in excellence.  Another book that can be likened to Ghost World is The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger, and even The Graduate shares themes with Ghost World.  The narrative revolves in all three around characters who have reached a juncture in their life where the road splits many different ways, causing confusion.\n\nThe wonderful thing about Ghost World, however, is that Enid&apos;s reluctance to grow old is accentuated by the other characters ensuring their lives advance.  Even Seymour &quot;grows up&quot; when he finally meets his attractive blonde.  Constant reminders of Enid&apos;s immaturity make this film.  When the two visit Josh&apos;s apartment and he is not in, Enid scrawls an immature and explicit note to him and hangs it on the door knob.  But we hear Becky ask &quot;Are you really gonna leave that?&quot;  This is one of the first signs of a difference between Becky and Enid.  More follow, particularly the job hunting fiasco, in which Becky quickly finds and keeps her bum counter job in a coffee house, where as Enid jumps from job to job, her immature cynicism ensuring job loss.\n\nPlenty happens in this film.  Not least the ending, which, contrary to something I have read, is not an ending that the director rashly consturcting to rescue a failing storyline.  Thankfully, the ending from the book was retained for the film, and it proves to be similarly poignant on screen. This is not a bus to nowhere, it is a bus out of nowhere.  Enid finally finds a direction in her life - even if the direction is wide and undefined.\n\nMy only criticisms of Ghost World is that 1) the directing was tepid, showing little flare whatsoever, which detracts from the film and 2) Enid&apos;s university application in the book was not kept in the film.  This was a particularly pivotal point in the book I felt, and it was unfortunate it was not kept in the film.\n\nHowever, the acting is enjoyable - Buscemi is wonderful as the lugubrious Seymour and Birch is commendable as Enid.  The comedy is a plus point in the film, however, I object to it being defined as a comedy, as the book was not and people may have seen this film expecting incisive comedy when the real story is far far more subtle than the frank comedy.\n\nDefinitely see this film.  The desperate nature of the two protagonists is quite heartbreaking, the comedy characters are suitably cliched to ensure lightweight laughs (such as the hilarious store manager), and the ending is very good.\n\nI give this film eight out of ten."

      "reviewBody": "This excellent documentary is a universal story; it depicts a situation which happens everywhere. However, the local flavor of the situation lived by these 4 or 5 gay men in southwestern Germany, and the reaction of their fellow villagers are unique, allowing us a rare peek of real life in (arguably) the richest, most picturesque, and most stereotypical area of &quot;romantic&quot; small villages in rural Germany.\n\nAs hard as this documentary tries to show prejudice and intolerance towards gays in this area of Germany, the attitude of these provincial &quot;hillbillies&quot; still rank favorably with liberal attitudes in world capitals outside Western Europe. The film is not only worthwhile for depicting social morals in Schwabia, but for foreign audiences, it is a lesson on how amazingly tolerant, and sophisticated the &quot;backwaters&quot; of Germany are.\n\nAmong other features, these &quot;peasants&quot; vacation together in Bangkok and Thai beaches, appearing totally at ease with the sex tourism surrounding them; and the most &quot;macho and intolerant&quot; older family men and cute grandmas discuss gay sex openly, though some of them are not in favor. These conversations, among retired Christian conservatives,  are unthinkable in most of the world&apos;s major metropolis, speaking volumes for tolerance in rural Germany.\n\nThe film recently premiered in Rio&apos;s annual international film festival to packed houses, which interestingly also included apparently curious &quot;cute grandmas&quot; and mainstream senior citizens. It&apos;s a film which provokes rethinking of old ideas, and will do tons for human rights.\n\nThat is, if people see it. From the voting on this page, it looks like I&apos;m still among a lucky few. The documentary looks like a special German TV program projected on screen only for a few markets. But, hopefully, the film and its message will find a very big audience in its TV transmissions in Germany and throughout Europe.",

      "reviewBody": "My English-language print of this film is called BODY IN CENTRAL PARK. This comes midway in the German &quot;Jerry Cotton&quot; crime series, starring George Nader, and it delivers the action and style one expects from the series. The plot revolves around rich businessman being blackmailed and threatened with the murder of their children. For a German crime film, the plot is relatively easy to follow, and the film is not as stylized as the earlier B&amp;W entries in the series nor as convoluted as some of the later ones. While the Cotton series is often compared with James Bond, I really don&apos;t see much similarity, besides the fact that both men are government agents. The series (especially the early entries) seems more like an attempt to extend the early 60s German Edgar Wallace mysteries into imitation-American hard-boiled crime films. Eddie Constantine&apos;s &quot;Lemmy Caution&quot; crime films, which pre-date Dr. No and James Bond, seem much more Bond-like than Jerry Cotton, who could have been the hero of a 1950s US crime series, except for the 1960s modern settings of the films. Peter Thomas&apos; musical score is relatively understated (for him, at least!) here, and Nader is as convincing as ever as the tough, stylish FBI man Cotton. If you have already seen some of this series, you&apos;ll want to see this one, although it&apos;s not the best. If you are not familiar with the series, any of the earlier ones--including this one--would be a good introduction to one of the best series of crime films of the 1960s. I&apos;m hoping English language versions of these will eventually find their way onto DVD--perhaps in double bills! While Mr. Nader is no longer with us, perhaps some of the German cast/crew can do commentary tracks.",

Both movies follow basically the same formula: A crazy, super exaggerated walking stereotype played by Sacha Baron Cohen goes to America, getting involved in wacky antics and meeting some celebrities along the way, often in front of real unsuspecting crowds. Do people hate this movie because its the same formula again? I guess you could argue Borat is a little funnier than Bruno, but even still, its hard to get a laugh out of me and I involuntarily burst out laughing at least 15 or 20 times. Is it because of offensive, overly exaggerated gay stereotypes? I know this movie goes a bit far at points, but come on people, have a sense of humor! Pointing out Americans&apos; ignorance of foreigners with funny accents is OK but doing the same thing with gays is too much? Sure. I often find myself rating movies lower than the average score, but this is a great movie, and I&apos;d easily give it a 7 or 8. I honestly have no idea where the hate for this movie is coming from. Granted, its a HARD R and some of its more extreme content might be a little off putting to some, but come on people, this movie is hilarious!",

It&apos;s one of the best movies by Martin Fric (like Kristi√°n or Tri vejce do skla). It is a nice story about one young lady Eva who wants to steal the instructions for planting the strange roses (invented by her neighbor). Eva means to give it to the aunt as a present to her coming anniversary. She pretends she is an excellent secretary and enters in the family house of neighbors... There is also another plot: Eve&apos;s brother is bound to play a role of English aristocrat in this house. There are many comic situations rising from this plots. The movie is witty, the humor of it is loose and crazy and atmosphere of it is appealing. This mood associated late summer with its warm nights and jaunty plays. The performances are great. Natasa Gollov√° is both beautiful and wildly crazy. Her joyride contrasts with lightly ironic behavior and mature quiet of Oldrich Novy (in a role of her brother). The music by Kamil Behounek and Jiri Traxler is also perfect.",

Bullet, superbly directed and acted out with a profundity which we rarely witness in movies of this genre, had been treated with utter injustice for it was released directly to video. It features the day-to-day reality which does not conform to society and its laws as well as the teachings of theologians or those professed by pedagogues in high schools and universities. I had lived in BKLN for nine years before moving to London. There is nothing more sad than wasted youth and drug-induced frustration. Bullet demonstrates that only too well. Those of you who love Bullet might enjoy watching Menace to Society, New Jersey Drive and 187. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions or comments. optimism_always@yahoo.com",

      "name": "Lubitsch enters his niche",
      "reviewBody": "Settling in Hollywood and freed from the whims of Mary Pickford, Ernst Lubitsch moved from the independent distributor United Artists to the minor studio Warner Brothers where he was allowed to make the first film in his career that really feels like a Lubitsch film. He&apos;d touched on the ideas and tone here and there, mostly in his comedies The Doll and The Oyster Princess, but there was an embrace of silly physical comedy that seemed a bit out of step with his later work while engaging in more overt forms of farce. Not to imply that those didn&apos;t work, but they were just different. Now, with The Marriage Circle, Lubitsch was quickly settling into his domestic and romantic concerns between men and women that embrace wittiness rather than silliness.\n\nSet in Vienna, the film is the story of two couples and a single man. The first couple are Professor Josef Stock (Adolphe Menjou) and his wife Mizzie (Marie Prevost), a pair who have been married for some time and have lost the spark of romance between them. Mizzie is best friends to Charlotte (Florence Vidor) who is newly married to Dr. Braun (Monte Blue), and the couple are deeply, earnestly in love. Dr. Braun has an associate, Dr. Mueller (Creighton Hale) who is smitten with Charlotte but also has the wherewithal to not actually act on it. Jealousy, intended adultery, and mistaken intentions end up driving the plot of the film as Mizzie decides that she&apos;s going to have an affair with Dr. Braun because he can obviously bring romance to her that her husband no longer offers. Meanwhile, Charlotte confides in Mizzie because she thinks that Dr. Braun is actually intent on an affair with the young Miss Hofer (Esther Ralston), and Professor Stock is so convinced of his wife&apos;s infidelity that he hires a private detective to follow her and gather evidence (that he guarantees he&apos;ll collect and lead to a divorce).\n\nThe joys in the film early are the lightly farcical elements, mostly around Charlotte thinking that Dr. Braun is infatuated with Miss Hofer, so she ends up pushing Mizzie towards Dr. Braun, thinking that it will blunt Dr. Braun&apos;s potential infidelities. The look on Mizzie&apos;s face as Charlotte literally pushes her into Dr. Braun&apos;s arms during a dance is really funny. And yet, there&apos;s always a satirical and sharp edged undertone to what&apos;s going on. Charlotte knows that something is wrong somewhere, and she trusts the one woman she shouldn&apos;t to help fix it. That helps the film veer really closely to something far more tragic than it turns out to be.\n\nDr. Braun ends up being a good man caught up in the wiles of an unscrupulous woman, and it seems like everything is going to go against him. Dr. Mueller thinks that he&apos;s cheating on his wife with Mizzie. Mizzie thinks he&apos;s just playing hard to get. Professor Stock ends up convinced, through his private investigator&apos;s work, that Dr. Braun is definitely having an affair with Mizzie. It&apos;s Dr. Braun&apos;s social standing that&apos;s at risk here, never his business or his life, but you can feel the edges of everything collapsing around him even though he has no way of making it better despite his best efforts. For a solid twenty minutes, I was convinced that this was going to be a tragedy.\n\nAnd then things turn around. Just desserts are served. Social reputations are saved, and Dr. Braun ends up with the last laugh while two unlikely potential lovers end up leaving Vienna together. There&apos;s real delight in this ending because the character work had been so solidly built.\n\nNow, I&apos;ve complained pretty consistently that Lubitsch&apos;s characters have been thin through his silent period, in particular in his more tragic skewing historical films. I wonder if that&apos;s something to do with the writer of the film&apos;s scenario, Paul Bern, an Irving Thalberg devotee later in life. Lubitsch had regularly worked with Hanns Kraly and Norbert Falk while in Germany, but Bern seems to have understood how to build character in a silent film more naturally. The film&apos;s story is stripped of unnecessaries. It&apos;s not intimately tied to Vienna itself and could honestly have taken place in any major city of the time. The jobs of the individuals aren&apos;t that important and rarely get mentioned or really addressed directly. It&apos;s really about building up a cache of five characters and letting them operate within the rather plain looking surroundings, offering them a chance to bring themselves out of the realm of caricature and into actual character. Lubitsch allows his camera to let Mizzie be herself, her own awful self, and Stock to be himself, his own, detached self, in such a way that their relationship makes sense quickly, setting the groundwork very efficiently for Mizzie to understandably form designs on a more romantic man than her own husband.\n\nThe Marriage Circle is quite comfortably Lubitsch&apos;s most successful film up to this point. Whether it was the freedom from German company Ufa&apos;s house styles, his former writers, lessons he&apos;d learned working for Mary Pickford, or the introduction of a new, talented writer in Paul Bern, Lubitsch was finding his voice more comfortably than ever. It may not end up being one of Lubitsch&apos;s great films, but it&apos;s the first film that is firmly Lubitsch while also being consistently entertaining and even a bit touching.",

      "reviewBody": "The Naked Man in the Stadium is a light drama about a talented sculptor whose work seems to be out of sync with people around him. There is not much plot, although the movie is loosely centered around the artist&apos;s effort to create a statute of an athlete for a small town soccer club. The film is made up entirely of short scenes told in a deliberately flat style. You follow the artist around as he works and deals with family, friends, patrons, models and members of the public who seem bewildered by his work. He spends a lot of time talking to people about how they feel about his work and art in general. A lot of people might find this dull but my interest never waned. The movie is helped quite a bit by Kurt Bowe&apos;s charismatic performance and the glimpses of East German life during the early 1970s. An interesting meditation on art and a time capsule look at East Germany.",

      "reviewBody": "Amos Oz is one of the most important writers of Israel today, he is well known abroad, and his name is mentioned many times in the context of the Nobel Prize awards. He is also one of the most lucid activist writers in a country which still fights for its existence and with the definition of its character and path in the future.\n\nI like the documentary screened by the European TV chain ARTE, which presents a long interview of Amos Oz, mostly centered around his biography, his childhood in Jerusalem in the 40s. his parents, his life in the kibbutz. Oz is also filmed while meeting with other writers, with politicians, while traveling abroad, or discussing the problems of the area with a prominent Palestinian intellectual. The commentary and Oz&apos;s testimony are well selected and interesting all over. His thoughts about the relations between Jews of European origin living in Israel and the old continent are worth being heard, and so are his comments about the peace process and politics in Israel. The only aspect that Oz does not speak about almost at all is his writings, and this may be the subject of a future film.",

He felt it was a rehash of characters he played before like in The Lavendar Hill Mob or The Man In The White Suit. Why he took it is a mystery unless this was the best he was being offered at the time. One thing he did note to his wife Merulla was that he felt that Robert Redford was going to be a big star.\n\nSituation Hopeless...But Not Serious is one weird film. It has some interesting and funny moments in it, but it&apos;s just way too weird. \n\nGuinness is some quiet and nebbish like German who in the waning days of World War II when two American fliers Captain Robert Redford and Sergeant Michael Connors take refuge in his basement, he locks them up there and they become his own private prisoners. Not that he treats them bad, he just craves company since he has no friends. On V.E. Day had he let them go, no harm no foul. But Guinness keeps them on through 1946.\n\nI could probably draw a lot of conclusions as to why Guinness&apos;s character was so wanting their company, but the Code was still somewhat in place. And as Guinness was a repressed gay Catholic man his whole life, this film must have hit close to home.\n\nFor the strangest Alec Guinness film out there, check out this one.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s incredible that it took an Austrian director, Otto Preminger, the courage to bring this wonderful screen adaptation of the Bizet&apos;s immortal opera Carmen to the American public. As a musical, &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; had been seen, successfully, on Broadway, because of the many talented black performers that weren&apos;t allowed to be seen in Hollywood movies. Preminger had a knack for tackling issues that other, better known directors, stayed away from.\n\n&quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, as seen today, shows us a film that is somehow dated, but when it made its debut, it surprised a lot of people because it was a revolutionary work, something the American movie goers weren&apos;t used to seeing. The strength of the film lies in the performances Mr. Preminger got from his multi-talented cast.\n\nThe adaptation of the opera sets the film in the South. We are taken to a military base during the war. The local people work in the factory, attached to the base, making parachutes and other war related equipment. Carmen Jones, is the sultry young woman who sticks out from the rest of her co-workers, not only by her beauty, which was obvious, but by the way she can reduce men to servitude, which is what happens to Joe, the man who is being promoted until fate intervenes and Carmen renders him useless.\n\nThe gorgeous Dorothy Dandridge made a magnificent Carmen Jones. In fact, this was Ms. Dandridge&apos;s best screen work because she smolders the screen every time she is seen in the film. Harry Belafonte is Joe, the man whose passion for the lovely Carmen will consume him and will not let him see straight. Pearl Bailey is a delight in her take of Frankie. Olga James is seen as the sweet Cindy Lou, the girl in love with Joe. Joe Adams, Brock Peters and a young Diahann Carroll are also seen in minor roles.\n\nSome comments to the IMDb forum express their displeasure at the way the voices are heard. This seems to have been the only thing that Preminger should have worked with his collaborators Oscar Hammerstein II and Harry Kleiner into having the opera melodies sung naturally, the way one would expect Ms. Dandridge, who could sing, and of course, Harry Belafonte, a wonderful singer, to deliver them in a way that would have pleased those audiences not accustomed to hearing classical opera.\n\nRegardless of what we think today, this was one of the breakthroughs that proved to America they could enjoy black performers on their merits and talent. Otto Preminger must be praised for being a pioneer in this field and for daring to be a man ahead of his time.",

The movie was very humorous, yet so insightful into Elliott&apos;s world. I think I finalized my love for Elliott as a result of seeing this movie. He was just so charming and thoughtful. This short film is semi-biographical, in that it introduces you to many of Elliott&apos;s friends, business acquaintances and people that knew him in a non-musical way, while at the same time, infusing a metaphorical mini-drama where Elliott is contemplating exchanging his own physical hand for a bulky, gaudy &quot;robot arm&quot;. For me, it was a way for Elliott to say that he regretted joining up with the big labels and fame, and that he probably felt weighted down by this bulky, gaudy new &quot;artistic arm&quot;. Cool interviews with Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss (Quasi, Sleater-Kinney).",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Wohin?&quot; &quot;Dahin&quot; The movie opens with the Herr Doktor cutting open a rotting corpse, declaring that he has looked for man&apos;s soul and has found that there is none. The scene is a microcosm of the film&apos;s despairing vision of modern man&apos;s immorality, descended into seeing all as mere material. In this world, the old moral code remains only in debased form: good does not exist but evil does. The film&apos;s aesthetic is ruled by filth, and everyone&apos;s body seems either decaying or malformed (bodies are all they are). And so too has Faust&apos;s famous bargain with the devil been seriously downgraded. Goethe&apos;s Faust was foolish but noble: he signed his soul away for knowledge, a mirage of human perfectibility. Sokurov&apos;s Faust signs his off without so much as a second thought - and for what? So little! A bit of money and a bit of ass. All here is only bestial (and fleeting) pleasure. There is no longer even a dream of something better. All are selfish, mean and disgusting, loving no one, not even themselves. The film is a nightmarish verdict on modern man: he has given up the better part of himself to live like an animal, and in the end does not even realize what he has done. We the viewer are left to wonder whether there ever was a &apos;better part&apos; of us at all. However, the one character who seems to recognize the fallen state of things is Faust&apos;s father, perhaps an indication that the old generation could still see the devil for what he is. Hardly hopeful, but maybe a sign that modern man&apos;s crass materialism and selfishness is not the whole story.",

      "reviewBody": "NOTE: According to the dictionary: Mandragora is 1) a plant of nightshade family: a plant with a forked root resembling a human body that was formerly believed to have magical powers and was made into a drug and 2) a 14th century alteration of medieval Latin mandragora, influenced by man, drake &quot;dragon&quot; (from its emetic and narcotic properties).\n\nMANDRAGORA, the astonishing film from the Czech Republic written by Wiktor Grodecki (who also directs) and David Svec (who also acts in the film), is aptly named: mandragora is the world of male prostitution that seduces young lads with promises of money and ultimately poisons them with the burning disease of loss of self respect and ultimately of life.Marek (Miroslav Caslavka in a stunning performance) is a beautiful 15-year-old kid from a little village in the Czech Republic who has aligned himself with petty criminals to have better things such as classy clothing, a lad whose single father (Jir√≠ Kodes) demands he stay in school (yet is always in the background to salvage Marek&apos;s errant life situations) and who seems to be prepping his son for a better life. Marek hates school, which he sees as merely a path to be a welder like his father. The father and son collide after another crime spree and Marek leaves home for the big city promises of Prague.\n\nOnce in Prague Marek is observed by the pimp Honza (Pavel Skripal) who follows Marek, knowing that Marek&apos;s future in the city is doomed without Honza&apos;s &apos;protection&apos;. Within a day&apos;s time Marek&apos;s luck with the slot machines dries up and Honza convinces him to be his &apos;rabbit&apos; - a male prostitute. Marek&apos;s first encounter with an American &apos;john&apos; ends disastrously and the beaten Marek returns to the streets where he encounters a fellow hustler David (David Svec). Together they forge an alliance to escape Honza&apos;s compound and begin a life of successful prostitution. They are bonded (the probability of Marek&apos;s actually being gay and physically attracted to David is strong) and together they encounter all manner of unseemly characters involved in the underbelly of Prague&apos;s male prostitution life.\n\nCharacters weave in and out of Marek&apos;s and David&apos;s life, each time leaving scars that grow more visible as does the threat of drug problems and AIDS. They eventually consent to embrace the lowest level of making gay porn where the cruel director forces Marek to be sodomized by David. They are raided by the police and Honza reappears as Marek&apos;s nemesis. Through a series of drug-induced hallucinations and dreams Marek envisions what his future holds and his descent is stamped. Yet at this point Marek&apos;s father journeys to Prague in search of his son, discovers his life style, is terrified and angry and tangentially passes Marek in a critical final scene that is devastatingly sad.\n\nThis film is dark, frank, cruel, realistic, and sweats with the evil of the belly of the beast that is Prague&apos;s underworld. Yet the direction is so fine and, equally important, the acting by Miroslav Caslavka so sensitive that we as the audience are swept into an overwhelming compassion for these unfortunate lads whose seemingly only hope for a better life is one of humiliating degradation. MANDRAGORA is a no holds barred examination of a dark life that maintains a precarious balance between caricature and character development. Yes, it is lengthy at 126 minutes, in need of editing in areas, has faulty subtitles, and a strange musical score by Wolfgang Hammerschmid who extrapolates Puccini&apos;s &apos;Nessun dorma&apos; and Bach&apos;s &apos;Erbarme dich&apos; and &apos;Ruhe sanft&apos; from the St Matthew Passion for heavy effects, and very dark cinematography by Vladim√≠r Holomek, but despite these sidebar problems, they only slightly mar the overall impact of a very important film.\n\nGrady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "Be honest: does the idea of a Shakespearean joke make your heart sink a little?  Do you think of obscure, lowbrow Elizabethan humour that MAYBE someone was kind enough to explain in a footnote?\n\nCertainly the comedies are harder to stage, but when they&apos;re well done ... One of the most exhilarating things about Shakespeare is the certain knowledge that no character will ever express himself poorly.  Well, characters like Dogberry do, in a sort of a way, but that&apos;s deliberately done for comic effect and doesn&apos;t count.  No character is ever thwarted by a lack of expressive power.  Whenever Benedick must plead his case, you know that he will summon up all the eloquence he needs; and whenever Beatrice insults anyone, you know that she will summon up all the venom and wit SHE needs.  In some ways it&apos;s easier to appreciate this in a comedy when the plot is, reduced to its essence, much ado about nothing.\n\nNo film director working today can approach Branagh when it comes to presenting Shakespeare cleanly and clearly, in a way that lets us participate in this verbal delight.  This particular film is actually funny, as well as verbally delightful.  It&apos;s also visually delightful - it has an attractive cast (Kate Beckinsale plays one of Shakespeare&apos;s ciphers but makes us understand why people fell in love with her), a sunny Tuscan landscape and a long tracking shot at the end that has to be seen to be believed.  Performances are all good (other comments here have convinced me that even Keanu Reeves fits into his role).  Comedy or not, this is the best Shakespeare film in years and is a candidate for being the best of all time.",

Frequently supposed dead and often delayed by years after the war&apos;s end, returning soldiers came back to families that had had to make all manner of compromises and sacrifices related to their absence.  Often the returnees found that their wives had re-married, or worse...\n\nThis is one such story.  Unusual for Ozu in that it depicts actual physical family violence.  A bit shocking if you are used to his other films, in which disapproval is often expressed with raised eyebrows and silence.\n\nA good film with fine performances."

      "reviewBody": "In 1932 many actors were still rather new to sound pictures and the great majority of them were theatre trained and while some would stay on in Hollywood, many would return to the stage to stay. Bette Davis was a young actress in the midst of making that decision to aty in Hollywood or return to New York and the stage. She had made several low buget pictures, but things just were not clicking for her. The success of this movie and the attention she received convinced her to stay on and make movies and we are all thankful for that. George Arliss was a grand old man of the stage and his artistry is well portrayed here. His makeup is a little heavy, making him look a little like the Phantom of The Opera with lipstick and darkened nostrils, but soon you get beyond that. The acting is almost strictly stage-style here, this MUST have been a play before it was filmed. The blocking and angles of the actors and the way they seem to talk &quot;at&quot; each other rather than to each other shows the stage acting. Great story, nice escapism... who wouldnt like to help others? We can do that through George Arliss in this movie."

I&apos;m laughing at jokes I&apos;ve already seen, and I&apos;m not particularly dumb today, at least I think so...\n\nI&apos;m not a Spade fan either, but sometimes he just makes it.\n\nPlus, I really hate some romantic comedies, with pauses on jokes for girlie scenes (sorry girls for the sexism...) Spade and Marceau have managed to turn even these scenes into funny tirades...\n\nI recommend. Not the best comedy ever, but I give it a 7.\n\nIt made me recover from my disgust with romantic Hollywood comedies after that Aniston-Vaughn flick which I wanted so much to watch, just to get disappointed later.",

      "reviewBody": "This classic version of &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; is one of the most entertaining examples of the low-budget, black-and-white horror films that used to be such a mainstay for movie fans. It has few frills, but it does have some thrills, and in particular it has a cleverly written story that is told at a brisk pace, with a good deal of interesting and pleasingly macabre detail.\n\nHorror legend Vincent Price is in his element as the mysterious millionaire who invites a houseful of guests to spend the night in a supposedly haunted mansion, and his performance will give his fans everything that they expect. The supporting cast is solid, led by Elisha Cook, who is very good as a nervous, tipsy character whose rambling proclamations of doom add the right touch of offbeat suspense. The settings are given plenty of detail that makes the characters&apos; explorations of the house even more interesting.\n\nThe story is nicely written for the genre, making very good use of the possibilities in the setup, throwing in some good turns, and resolving everything in a resourceful fashion. And it&apos;s not without some real suspense - even those who normally watch low-budget horror features solely for the camp factor might get an actual start once or twice as everything plays out. And even if you don&apos;t find anything scary, there is plenty here that makes it enjoyable to watch."

      "reviewBody": "Revisiting old films that you thought were average isn&apos;t necessarily a good thing. They sometimes get worse. Championed by the Fangoria camp (in Gorezone they labeled it &quot;the scariest film since Texas CHAINSAW&quot;¬Öum, no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably developed a cult following as an &quot;intense&quot; horror picture. Actually, it is just an average stalk and slash¬Öuh, bite film that briefly sets itself aside from the pack by featuring a killer who clucks like a chicken. Yes, clucks like a chicken. To the filmmaker&apos;s credit, at least they didn&apos;t make the killer sound like a duck a la THE NEW YORK RIPPER. That would just be silly.\n\nNarrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I&apos;m not saying that slasher films are abound with reason, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers escaped. Luther is actually paroled after a lengthy scene where people argue he is reformed, even though he clucks like a chicken and has razor dentures (which he apparently fashioned in prison). It is the kind of film where a couple sees a bashed in door and the girl dismisses it by saying, &quot;Oh, my mom must have forgotten her keys. She forgets a lot of things since my dad died.&quot; The kind of film where the hysterical mother runs into a cop looking for Luther and tells him, &quot;The killer is in my house!&quot; So what does he do? He grabs her and literally drags her back to the house and says, &quot;Just show me where he is and I&apos;ll do the rest.&quot; Why not call back up? \n\nIt is too bad the film is filled with such horrible action and dialogue because the Luther character is actually pretty interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a dead ringer for Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, who gives the clucking Luther a genuine air of menace. In the hands of a right director, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a true cinematic oddity. But Albright is not that director and merely places the fascinating character of Luther in tedious slasher trappings.",

      "reviewBody": "When it comes to art, the best one can do is receive it with grace, measure it against one&apos;s soul and if one is so inclined, speak from the heart about it. That&apos;s the only thing that matters, all else falling away. Comments about the execution are irrelevant, really. If someone talks about that, it isn&apos;t from their heart and doesn&apos;t really matter. This is excellently executed, but with art the only demand is that it cross a threshold of competence, making it close enough for us to reach. All else is decoration. Read elsewhere for comments on the decorative qualities of this.\n\nI&apos;ll start from the end. I recommend you see this because it is a necessary launching ramp for &quot;8 1/2.&quot; I believe that film is essential viewing for any citizen of the world, and to get it, you have to sit through this. Its roughly the same shape: Fellini himself, an empty and artless man posing as an artist who can only place himself in a definition of emptiness defined by the seven types of women.\n\nIn this world ¬ó a convincing one ¬ó women define the world by their being, and all spaces ¬ó physical spaces I mean ¬ó are carried by them into existence. Men merely stand between surrounding walls and the woman who made them whether she is present or not. When strained through the cloth of cinema, we have something like this film. (I wish some Japanese filmmaker would do for this what &quot;H Story&quot; did to &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amore&quot; but in Barcelona.)\n\nSo it is a competent film, even decorative. It is art, and for reasons beyond itself, you should see it. \n\nBut it doesn&apos;t measure well against my soul. Nor famously did it against Fellini&apos;s, which is why, after a celebrated crisis, he developed a different style for his next films. I suppose it is true that you could see this as about the bankruptcy of Roman aristocrats, or about more general bankruptcy of men. But I see it as about Fellini&apos;s own self inflicted, selfaware malaise.\n\nBut why is this one recommended to be rejected and the later one valued? Because of the cinematic form, dear friends. That&apos;s all that matters. Usually this form is considered realistic or neorealistic and the later films fantastic surreal. I think we can do better than that. The &quot;neorealistic&quot; films are composed by a self that stands outside. It sees and reports. It sees and judges; this is a film that assumes judgment. Its an essay, &quot;explained&quot; because both the filmmaker and the viewer stand outside it. Even the edges of the frame are perfectly placed, so as to remind us of the window we peer through.\n\n&quot;8 1/2&quot; and his other project I admire (&quot;Block-notes di un regista&quot;) have the filmmaker distinctly in the thing. The edges shift. We are invited in. Some things aren&apos;t clear, what we encounter hasn&apos;t been filtered to make sense for us. Its a party, but not one the camera understands, so we are in the midst of the battle instead of observing the party.\n\nSo if it is art you come for, you won&apos;t find it here unless you think competent decoration and impressive effect matter. What matters is whether the artist&apos;s blood mingles with ours, and Fellini didn&apos;t bleed until after this, probably because of this. Later, he did add that girl at the beach so his types of women total 8. I suppose you need to see this, then &quot;8 1/2,&quot; then Greenaway&apos;s &quot;8 1/2 Women.&quot;\n\nIt may not be the best way to capture a film, by bracketing it somehow. But it works for me in this case. This is just a bracket.\n\n+++++++\n\nOne could say things about many of the characters and performances, and I cannot resist mentioning one: Nico. In the next to last segment, she plays a top model engaged to a royal nitwit. We gather at his castle and go ghost-hunting where we are given the woman-outside- the-walls story. This was when she really was a top model and before she became Andy Warhol&apos;s primary avatar in the world. She originated the &quot;Gothic&quot; look copied by millions of girl misfits. She reinvented a form of sultry singing (then newly in rock) that turns the notion of this movie inside out: deliberately soulless and therefore attractive.\n\nThis film also brackets her amazing glow as the Chelsea Girl. THE Chelsea Girl. \n\nYou should know about her. She had a real life. We all live in the ashes, unbeknownst.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

This film successfully avoids that trap.\n\nThe story has echoes of samurai tales to it, though the settings are the deserts of Rajastan and the mountains of the Himalayas - lowlands bad, mountains good, as always. \n\nThe lead actor is both expressive and restrained, the support is sufficient, and the whole experience moving.

      "name": "A Mediocre Script, But the Action Is Everything You Want It To Be!",
      "reviewBody": "Note: Check me out as the &quot;Asian Movie Enthusiast&quot; on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.\n\nChocolate is the perfect &quot;acid test&quot; to determine who are fans of action movies and who are not. How so? Let me explain. A true fan of action movies has the ability to overlook some flaws in film-making (e.g., script, acting, character development, etc.) if the action sequences are exceptional enough to make up for them. This is no different from fans of art-house dramas who can overlook minimal content if the film can portray everyday life in interesting ways. With that said, Chocolate is one of the best examples of an action movie that has such extraordinary fight sequences that they easily overpower any deficiencies in the script.\n\nAn autistic girl with martial arts skill attempts to collect on the debts of her sick mother. This movie has a mediocre script, and requires some patience from the viewer to slug through the early moments. Once the 30 minute mark arrives, however, the viewer is treated to one of the most amazing displays of asskicking by a female protagonist in the history of action cinema. Virtually all of the remaining 50 minutes is devoted to high quality choreography and bone-crunching maneuvers. The settings and scenarios change frequently, thereby avoiding any feel of repetition or monotony. This is brainless action at its very finest. JeeJa Yanin ‚Äì an amazing specimen with her fluid moves and hard strikes ‚Äì catapults herself into the upper echelon of female action stars with this single movie. Her punches and kicks start off rather basic, but get increasingly more complex until they peak during the jaw-dropping finale that lasts a whopping 20 minutes. Lots of fun to be had here.\n\nNow, a snobby moviegoer will cry about the negatives without even considering the positives. Anyone who does not enjoy the action in this movie seriously needs to get their pulse checked, or at least schedule for a re-alignment of their action movie tastes. There&apos;s nothing more scintillating than watching a cute girl kick the living hell out of hundreds (quite literally) of stuntmen in a variety of environments. Basically, if you&apos;re not entertained by this, you&apos;re not a fan of action movies. (You probably didn&apos;t like So Close or Azumi either, right?) Stop fooling yourself and go watch another Tsai Ming-liang film.\n\nSome critics have claimed that this movie &quot;ripped off&quot; other movies. It didn&apos;t. There are a few homages that last a few minutes at most (a few Bruce Lee references, a locker scene reminiscent of Jackie Chan, and some footage from Tony Jaa&apos;s movies). These few scenes are only a drop in the bucket, because 95% of the action is independent of any references to other movies. The sign-post battle on the apartment complex balconies is one glaring example of a completely novel (and breathtaking) sequence that pays homage to no one but itself.\n\nThis is definitely worth a blind buy. True fans of martial arts mayhem will end up re-watching the action scenes about a thousand times.",

Its great to see someone who can really dance match up with Shahid. Shahid is his usual serious self, and doesn&apos;t come through much in contact with the viewers, but his acting was tip top and enjoyable. The story was so colorful that i was laughing unexpectedly at times. The make up for Rani as a male was realistic, i actually know someone that looks like that. My only comment is the case of the disappearing and re-appearing eye shadow and make-up. As soon as she throws everything male off she checks in for seconds into invisible beauty salon and re-appears fully beautified :D. More or less very enjoyable and will own it on DVD, the music is lively and makes you want to dance the bhangra. And for you all women rights hater males who voted poor for the movie, let me tell you its not that she was a girl its that she played better than men (in the movie) so the image of weaker sex can&apos;t play with guys was abolished and nullified to the zennith.. thats why everyone with a sane mind clapped at the end.",

His mastery of space and lighting, his disturbing compositions and vigorous editing are an eternal pleasure not to be enjoyed again until Scorcese&apos;s glory days.",

But this one is a mess of missed opportunities. Same premise as HILLS HAVE EYES, but a group of teenager/early 20s rather than a family. That in itself is a missed opportunity (but not a big one) because we all know where horror films go when there&apos;s a gang of gregarious kids around. There&apos;s a stupid and unnecessary prologue where we see 2 girls get killed that pretty much gives away the whole story in 3 minutes. If these kids were any goofier, they&apos;d be in a cartoon instead. There&apos;s no build of suspense, the frights are few, the cannibals look like friends and family of the film-makers with very little make-up or reason to be the way they are. And there&apos;s too many of them anyway. The cannibal hide-out is a cave and then it&apos;s an old building, then a cave again. There&apos;s no good sense of where anything is here. The leader of the cannibals, while plenty big enough, has the most ludicrous facial appearance and isn&apos;t at all scary, his mate is just a screaming mimi. With a decent effort on makeup and a bit of style and maturity this could have been pretty good, but save your time and watch HILLS HAVE EYES instead. Heck, even HILLS HAVE EYES 2 is grade A compared to this."

      "reviewBody": "I had never heard of this one (or director Spina, for that matter) before its screening on late-night Italian TV last year; in view of a favorable write-up on the indispensable &quot;Stracult&quot; book, I decided to record the film but only now did I manage to fit it in my schedule (since I am currently going through a &quot;Euro-Cult&quot; marathon). Anyway, while certainly interesting ‚Äì both visually (being laden with pop-art references) and thematically (a sci-fi tale about the creation of supermen) ‚Äì the whole proved somewhat tiresome, especially after a hard day&apos;s work, given a decidedly cerebral approach (albeit not unexpected considering its year of release)! Incidentally, the original Italian title translates to WOMAN, SEX AND SUPERMAN ‚Äì indicating that the sexual revolution, again typical of the era, was as much at its core as the science (not that it was particularly explicit). The cast is led by Richard Harrison (usually seen in peplums or Spaghetti Westerns, he seems a bit overwhelmed by the material and not a bit silly when taking to the skies ‚Äì though his woodenness is, ironically, ideal for projecting the character&apos;s eventual robotic nature!) and Adolfo Celi as the megalomaniac villain (tapping into his earlier stint as a larger-than-life James Bond nemesis) who, as one more sign of the times, is an industrialist owning the titular company; leading lady Dorothy West, while also unknown to me, makes an appealing doe-eyed heroine ‚Äì and just as much involved is Celi&apos;s obligatory mad scientist assistant who adopts a unique terminology throughout. The anything-goes mood suggests the film was conceived as a satire (anticipaing in this regard William Klein&apos;s similarly spotty MR. FREEDOM [1969]) but, alas, this very ostentation is what dates it above all; mind you, FANTABULOUS is undeniably colorful and entertaining on the surface, and yet not exactly memorable",

His comedic sensibility was unique in its poetry and effortless sophistication.\n\nOne doesn&apos;t expect an iron-clad plot in musical comedy, but MONTE CARLO&apos;s fails to fulfill even the minimal requirements of the genre. It simply makes no sense and creates no tension, erotic or otherwise. A nobleman falls for a runaway countess, and for absolutely no reason he pretends to be a commoner for the duration of the film.\n\nLubitsch is normally so good at plot construction, it&apos;s surprising that this one is so flat. Zasu Pitts, who can be so delightful, makes no impression here. Even the dialogue discouragingly fails to sparkle.\n\nThe film&apos;s other problem is the leading man, Jack Buchanan, who simply doesn&apos;t come across well on-camera and has absolutely no chemistry with MacDonald. Compared to the robust, lusty Maurice Chevalier in other Lubitsch/MacDonald films, Buchanan here is fey and sexless. MacDonald does her best, though, and acquits herself well.\n\nNo Lubitsch film is without its pleasures. It&apos;s worth seeing, but it&apos;s no MERRY WIDOW.",

Loved the soundtrack, loved Ruth Diaz in this movie. Every emotion she felt, I felt. Talk about fear. This movie haunts me daily. In order to appreciate all that this movie has to offer, you should first learn more about the actual horrific crimes against the 30,000 people that disappeared in Argentina from 1976-1983. Knowing this first will make your heart ache and jump as you watch how this movie unfolds, untwists and as it opens up to let you in and keeps you there. That is what I felt the director was trying to do but for some people, they may not know of the horrors of the forced disappearances that happen in many other countries around the world. This movie really opened my eyes to these horrors.",

      "reviewBody": "I find silent films more eerie than the talking B&amp;W horror films (Dracula, Frankenstien, the Thing from Another World) and also more eerie than the modern color films (Suspiria, Ju-on, the Descent). The exaggeration in the actors gestures and expressions; the early camera technology that&apos;s not quite fluid and not quite clear; the tinted colors; and an artificially overlaid soundtrack ¬ñ it all combines and adds up to paint an abstract and unnatural picture.\n\nCinema has evolved so far since the Silent Era that watching these films is almost like glimpsing into another world completely unrelated to the one most of us grew up watching. And I find it fascinating that this is, indeed, the ancestor to many horror films that I adore today. So, like with other classics, I viewed Phantom of the Opera with the delight of discovering our cinematic horror roots ¬ñ seeing the predecessor to Jack Pierce, Rick Baker, and Stan Winston in action, watching the precursor to John Carpenter, Mario Bava, and David Cronenberg.\n\nFrom the opening scene, Phantom of the Opera makes great use of shadows. A character with a lantern wanders the labyrinth below the Paris Opera house, ducking into an alcove as the shadow of the Phantom passes. Barring a handful of shots showing a cloaked figure from behind (or from a distance), this motif continues as Erik, the Phantom, is represented as a shadow, calling to Christine from the catacombs behind her dressing room mirror until she inevitably comes face to face with the mask (which she will inevitably remove.) Even though I&apos;m quite familiar with the face of Lon Chaney&apos;s Phantom from the numerous still-shots out there, I still felt the pulse of anxiety and suspense when that famous moment drew near. Though blatantly exploitive in its camera angle, the timing, the expression on Chaney&apos;s face, though it aims purely for spectacle and shock for the audience of 1925, it carries something newer spectacles/shock-films lack: charm.\n\nI couldn&apos;t help but smile watching Chaney&apos;s haunting performance beneath that famous makeup, seeing it animated for the first time, the sadness and tragedy that underlines the phantoms soul. He moves with a precision and deliberateness that&apos;s not entirely natural, but remains paradoxically sincere. The rooftop scene, in particular, where Christine and Raoul plot, oblivious to the presence of the unmasked phantom who listens in with great intensity from his perch above ¬ñ gripping his cape in his heartbroken state, eventually throwing himself back into the grasp of the statue in disbelieving defeat.\n\nThere&apos;s something both awkward and poetic to the movements of the actors as they express their emotions not in subtleties, but rather in exaggerated body language that almost feels at home here (almost, but not quite.) Early in the film, frightened ballerinas spontaneously spin in place (one revolution) as a visual representation of their anxiety. Somewhat silly, but simultaneously delightful in its approach.\n\nLater in the film, Christine rejects the Phantom, arcing her back to its limit, her face turned as far away as possible, with her hands outstretched as if the very air around Erik would prove toxic. A single still frame presented to an audience, completely isolated from the context of the rest of the film, would leave absolutely no room for misinterpretations.\n\nThe film goes on to a larger scope and bigger thrills with the inevitable fall of the chandelier, the Phantom&apos;s many tricks and traps in the catacombs under the Paris Opera House, and the final pursuit where the mob chases Erik through the streets of Paris -- the film strains itself to outdo all the silent films that came before. However, it strains too far, and I find myself liking the film in its quieter, more personal, exploits (the phantom in the shadows, the unmasking, the rooftop.) I do have to comment on the end of the film, though: Erik has been cornered and surrounded on all sides by the angry mob. He raises up a closed fist threateningly, as though within his grasp lay one final card that could level the playing field -- an explosive of some type -- and the crowd visibly hesitates, backing off. After a dramatic pause, the Phantom opens his hand to reveal he&apos;s holding nothing at all.\n\nThen we realize the film, itself, has done the very same thing. For the length of its running time it convinces you it held something -- some kind of awe-inspiring trick up its sleeve. Thus the problem with all exploitation films, but you have to admire Phantom for how it sustains so little for so long and makes you smile after you realize the truth.\n\nLike a good magic trick."

Most of this is because it really doesn&apos;t do anything at all and spends a great deal of time not doing much of anything. While the concept of having bizarre visions may be horrific to those experiencing them, on film they play out so ordinarily and boring that the film appears to be so slow as to be utterly lifeless and uninteresting. Eventually it does get better towards the end when the zombified owner does get around to making an appearance and that leads to some fun in the apartment showdown being chased around by such a creepy and visually imposing presence, and the atmosphere does give off a nice suspenseful vibe, yet the fact remains that this one is just so dull and lifeless that this one really doesn&apos;t have a lot to recommend about it.\n\nRated R: Violence and Graphic Language",

The many characters are played mostly by non professionals, i.e. are not working actors, and the result gives a documentary feel to the film. Amazingly the level of acting is very high and ensures that the film is completely believable and absorbing from beginning to end. Perhaps the only drawback is the limited time available to develop each main character. The viewer wants to know more about them and their lives but time is limited.\n\nThe film shows a part of Israeli society rarely shown in Israeli films (Arab Moslem and Arab Christian families living in Ajami) and the makers are to be commended for their achievement in showing a rather hidden side of our society.",

      "reviewBody": "The Rounders is one of those oddly well-crafted movies which seems to have benefited from a fortunate gathering of the stars at its making. Good movie-making alone seems insufficient to account for its success; every frame of the film seems almost hand-painted; every minute scripted with more than common care (if not with up-to-date cinematic technique).\n\nDirector and screenwriter Burt Kennedy is the center around which this gem of a movie formed - the same wry humor that has characterized most of his movie and TV productions shines through here (Kennedy created a small swath of &quot;Simon and Simon&quot; episodes, a span of &quot;Combat&quot; episodes, little, memorable Westerns like &quot;Dirty Dingus Magee,&quot; a little of almost every genre before passing on in 2001.) The cast, though, was one of those companies of actors you didn&apos;t often see together in low-budget Westerns then (1965) and still don&apos;t often see thirty-some years later. And, for a wonder, every actor and actress - from a remarkable cast - pulled his or her weight.\n\nDenver Pyle (&quot;Bull&quot;) would go on to anchor &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; as &quot;Uncle Jesse&quot; after a life in Westerns; Edgar Buchanan (as the irascible &quot;Vince Moore,&quot; creator of &quot;that wonderful stuff&quot; in a still located under his barn floor) was just embarking on a long stretch of soft duty as &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; in &quot;Petticoat Junction,&quot; plus a number of cameo roles in various other TV and movie projects after spending a good career in movies; Sue Ane Langdon was playing one of a number of sexy/innocent ingenue roles that ran from the late 1940s to the mid-1970s, then after a short hiatus, she would go on to play a series of older roles); Chill Wills would stay with the role of tightwad ranch owner &quot;Jim Ed Love&quot; for the movie AND the TV show which spun off of it the following year. \n\n&quot;The Rounders - The TV Series&quot; ran in the 1966 and 1967 seasons, not a bad run, considering the two leads were replaced by younger, less seasoned actors (including Patrick Wayne as &quot;Howdy Lewis&quot;); not only do we see Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda as the stars of this rollicking epic but as a bonus, Peter Ford and Peter Fonda (sons of the stars) appear in uncredited roles.\n\nThe production, if it can be said to have a weak spot, suffers from Disney Disease - that bogus-homespun touch which afflicted Disney&apos;s Wonderful World of Color&apos;s series of outdoor documentaries (in which announcers with wrinkly, familiar old voices narrated carefully-edited wildlife documentaries in which little baby animals hardly ever got caught by predators). Fortunately, the screenwriter played off of this ambiance for laughs, so that the overall feel is something like &quot;Mister Roberts Goes West.&quot; \n\nFonda (&quot;Howdy Lewis&quot;)and Ford (&quot;Ben Jones&quot;) work well together on screen as a pair of itinerant, half-clever cowboys who seem always to get the worst from every deal they make with Jim Ed Love. Both actors spent time with the novel, apparently, and their performances benefited from the extra work. This compensates for clumsy special effects (clumsily faked double takes from the &quot;plug-head&quot; horse who is the bane of &quot;Howdy&apos;s&quot; existence, for example).\n\nBut &quot;The Rounders&apos;&quot; main failing is also its saving grace - an artlessness which makes the show much more enjoyable (to me, anyway) than if it had been a little more polished. It earns a solid eight out of ten points for a great off-beat Western comedic style. \n\n&quot;The Rounders&quot; may just be the last good OLD Western movie; the genre lay in a restless, unquiet coma with brief flashes of lucidity (and a few unlamented &quot;electric westerns&quot;) until Clint Eastwood and a handful of other talented directors brought it back to vibrant life. But &quot;The Rounders&quot; is a valedictory for all of those great westerns (and all the not-so-great ones that were worth having, anyway) that Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Chill Wills, Edgar Buchanan, Denver Pyle and all the rest of those guys gave us.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s just what material objects do. They give us the security and tranquility to go on in life, when all other things appear to be crumbling. Rose Troche&apos;s &quot;The Safety Of Objects&quot; is one of the most interesting and poetic depictions of everyday life in a suburban &quot;paradise&quot; in the USA. Being from Mexico, is just another thing that allowed me appreciate it even more: I saw it like a foreigner, like a witness, without wanting to be part of the world Troche describes. But its message is so powerful, that I ended as part of this society that I already knew, but was afraid to accept. Based on the novel by A.M. Homes, &quot;The Safety Of Objects&quot; tells different stories, that reminded me of movies such as &quot;Happiness&quot; or &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, but in a really different tone.\n\nWe are presented early on to Esther Gold (a formidable, as usual, Glenn Close), a woman that has to deal with his sick son in a coma, and with her daughter who is unable to express what he feels about the situation of his beloved brother. We also are introduced to the Trains, a really nice couple that has come to a dead point in which the father, Jim (Dermot Mulroney in a really great performance) is dealing with a job crisis, and with the notion that maybe he doesn&apos;t have any goal in his life. His wife, Susan (Moira Kelly) tries to understand him but is unable to do so and starts to blame his husband for his usefulness around the house. Their kids seem like normal kids, but Jake, their son, has a strange obsession with a doll from his sister¬¥s room. Also, we met the Jennings and the Christianson, two more families living near by, and with their own secrets. And there&apos;s this strange guy, portrayed by Timothy Olyphant, that seems out of place, until we realize what is his part in this story.\n\nIt may be difficult to explain the different stories that Rose Troche carry on without seeing the film, but one detail is certain: it almost seems that in the center of all things is Paul Gold (Joshua Jackson), the comatose son of Glenn Close&apos;s character. And as we are seeing this people living their lives, we are also committed to think about our lives. These characters have lots of problems to handle, their own insecurity and all their fears, their unfulfilled lives, their need of attention and support, but in their hearts, they only need safety: the safety to know that tomorrow everything is going to be fine, but only if they allow themselves to breath, and go on.\n\nThis film is just a beautiful essay of how everyone in this world tries to feel safe. Jessica Campbell, Joshua Jackson&apos;s character&apos;s sister, feels safe with the guitar of his brother in his arms. Dermot Mulroney&apos;s character starts to feel safe when he goes from goal to goal, trying to find something to feel fine with himself and his own life. It is only when they start to realize what they are doing, and start to accept the things that surround them, that they become aware of the vacuity of the safety that objects bring. And their problems then become real, and manageable.\n\n&quot;The Safety Of Objects&quot; is an excellent motion picture, really. The work of Rose Troche as writer and director are really supreme, and the cast is really great too. Glenn Close shines as the always depressed and distant Esther, and Dermot Mulroney gives maybe the best performance of his life. Joshua Jackson&apos;s performance is credible, and Jessica Campbell is just great, along with Alex House, the kid with this &quot;Barbie obsession&quot;. Maybe in other countries outside USA, &quot;The Safety Of Objects&quot; could be just another film about life in the 2000. But for Americans, and for seekers of good films around the world, this is a beautiful essay of the triviality of material objects, and the real assumption of our place in the world, our goals in life, and above all, the knowledge that the way to solve our problems is facing our fears and our responsibilities. Life is made of these powerful ideas, it would be a crime to let life pass us by without knowing that we are breathing... and that we have to walk ahead, farther along the way.",

      "reviewBody": "This Italian micro-budget horror production isn&apos;t that good, but nonetheless it&apos;s not too bad for a first shot at a feature length production, as writer / director Gabriele Albanesi has created three horror shorts before it. With a title like that you&apos;ll know where it&apos;s target audience lies, and for most part it delivers on it if you just go in expecting something rather amateurishly crazy and explosively bloody in what is an all to familiar get-up. You can see its style is raw, lurid and recalls shades of 70s / 80s drive-in grindhouse exploitation. It&apos;s a total throwback. Even with this element, still it&apos;s hard to find it disturbing. It&apos;s far from it actually, as it&apos;s over-the-top hysterics (especially involving three moronic douche bags) and macabre confusion can see it fall on being darkly humorous. \n\nA young couple, Aurora and Rino are trying to come to terms to where their relationship is at or what was, but they&apos;re interrupted by three loutish thugs that bash Rino and attempt to rape Aurora. However an older married couple driving pass saves them from that disastrous fate and takes them back to their place to recover. But unknowingly to them this couple has a secret which might put Aurora and Rino in a great deal of unexplainable trouble.\n\nThe narrative is thoughtlessly thin and dank, but cluttered with so many disjointed plot structures (some that feel like a second thought as if made on the spot) which go onto to lead to an inevitable (and perplexing) explanation to all of this demented carnage. I&apos;m at a lost?! You can easily spot the influences from other horror films though. &apos;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&apos; shoots to mind. The unsubtle script was mostly horrendous. \n\nAfter a plodding beginning-- setting up Aurora and Rino&apos;s rocky relationship and their early encounters with the brain-dead thugs. The whole mystery surrounding the hospitable couple and their son is what holds you, until it throws you into the ugly, explicit violence and bewildering situation. Nothing suspenseful about it, but it&apos;s flipped out with it gushing with plenty of red stuff and gore skews into camp territory, but that final closing is shockingly weak and rushed. What was going against it is that there was no one to really cheer on (yep Aurora and Rino were less than desirable characters) as they weren&apos;t painted oh so greatly. \n\nGabriele Albanesi&apos;s direction stays conventional with some neatly realized images and fast moving zooms, but it&apos;s considerably well shot. Even when it decides the shake the camera about a couple of times. The electronic score stays low-key with a sensitively harrowing vibe, striking back to those old features. The pacing moves quick enough and the limited resources are handled effectively (like the make-up and splatter effects).The performances are very indifferent and quite poor (thanks again to those three ridiculous thugs). Daniela Virgilio and Daniele Grassetti didn&apos;t make much of an imprint as Aurora and Rino. Gennaro Diana and Santa De Santis&apos;s stiltedly icy portrayals bordered on farcical as the mysterious couple. David Pietroni was just laudably hammy as the main front man of the trio. \n\nUnusually ragged, but slightly amusing and outrageous Italian horror.",

The superb Gyula Kabos plays the relative who came home from Brazil, pretending to be poor while his beautiful daughter is Kl√°ri Tolnay. The handsome Imre R√°day plays the young man in love, while Ida Turay is the girl from the mansion. Watch out for a great character actress Piri Vaszary as the cantankerous mother. To know if there will be a happy end or not, you have to see the film. With many original jokes and superb acting, this comedy from Hungary is one of the best!",

Frequently, these films are reasonably universal, but their associations might be obfuscated, personal and subjective, never understood even by your friends unless explained. One such film, which chronicled absolute obsessive teenage love and its destructiveness was a wake-up call to a frequent, formerly obsessive type, myself in my misspent youth. This and the film&apos;s innate mastery instantly time-travel me back to days that were simultaneously more innocent and more complicated than today, late night smoky college discussions in a candle-lit apartments.\n\nAnd that film would be &quot;Deep End&quot; directed by Jerzy Skowlimowski, pal of Roman Polanski, with the same great mix of bizarre sensibilities and takes on life, done in professional, Hollywood-caliber production, even if on an indie budget.\n\nIt&apos;s from 1970, featuring music by Cat Stevens (Yusef Islam now to the non-infidel) and two unbelievably strong leads: a 15-year-old John Moulder Brown and 25-year-old Jane Asher (Paul McCartney&apos;s 1960&apos;s trophy girlfriend.) I never even knew Asher had these acting chops: she outdoes Susan Sarandon (similar upper class background) for letting us in on the nuances of a naturally pretty, fairly low-class young person. Moulder-Brown was the go-to kid for late 60&apos;s/early 70&apos;s films that required a teen to actually act. (Both are still working, happily.)\n\nThis is a dance of death pas de deux between a teen boy working at a grimy public pool in Britain, all hormones and eagerness, and his slightly older female co-worker, who&apos;s both a beauty and a inveterate tease. These two should never have been allowed to work together, as he quickly fixates on her, stalks her, and she tries to control the situation with her normal, over the top sexual flirting. It&apos;s pretty light and entertaining for a while, then it goes south. . . The title is &quot;Deep End,&quot; after all. I&apos;ve rarely seen a such a disturbing, creepy film about young lust that still has you rooting for everyone involved, no matter how wrongly they both behave. That&apos;s the sign of a sure cinematic touch."

Wilde happened to be very close to the lord queensberry&apos;s son, which just wasn&apos;t done at the time. Making things worse, his son alfred (john fraser) refused to stop spending time with wilde. When queensberry called wilde a sodomite, wilde brought queensberry (lionel jeffries) up on charges of libel; unfortunately, there were many witnesses who may have been able to back up queensberry&apos;s statement; after instigating the legal activity, wilde himself was tried. The awesome james mason is carson, defending queensberry. Pretty serious account; very few of wilde&apos;s clever sayings are included here. Directed by ken hughes, who had also done chitty chitty bang bang, casino royale. Very different stories, indeed.",

      "name": "Not just a cheap gimmick, the single shot tells a powerful story",
      "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock was one of the earliest filmmakers to experiment with single shot storytelling--that is, forsaking the conventional tools of cinema: cuts, edits, time lapse &amp; multiple cameras. In his 1948 masterpiece &quot;Rope&quot;, he tells the story of a murder and the slow unravelling of the murderer in real-time, using only around 10 cuts (which were unavoidable due to film cameras being limited to 10-minute magazines). Most critics called the film &quot;experimental&quot;, but the technique remains, to this day, one of the most suspenseful (and certainly difficult) ways of telling a story. The audience is brought into a real-time drama, like Orson Welles&apos; &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast, or perhaps a CNN broadcast of the 9/11 disaster. Real-time events remind us that we also dwell in the same world as the drama we are watching. And a capable director can make us feel like we&apos;re in the drama itself.\n\nWith this approach, there is no room for error; like a stage play, everyone has to be spot on. But &quot;PVC-1&quot; is no stage play. Unlike the minimalistic &quot;Rope&quot; which takes place entirely within 2 rooms, and unlike the carefully orchestrated &quot;Russian Ark&quot; (another single-shot film) which takes place in the rooms of the Hermitage Museum, &quot;PVC-1&quot; takes us across literally miles of scenery, never giving us the claustrophobic feeling of &quot;Rope&quot; but, perhaps more chilling, it gives us the feeling of having nowhere to run from a diabolical device that could end your life at any second. This is no tight, close-quartered, darkly-lit thriller like most. Here, scenes are wide open, unafraid to show the majesty of nature (a rural Columbian mountain village) contrasted starkly against ones mortality.\n\nThe story is very simple: in the first 10 minutes, a woman gets a PVC collar bomb glued around her neck. For the next 80 minutes we follow her plight as she &amp; her family try to get help. No zany plot twists are necessary, no mysterious whodunnits are required. Plain &amp; simple, this film conveys the feeling of facing an untimely death.\n\nDirector/writer/camera operator Spiros Stathoulopoulos brings us this emotionally gripping story based on the true events that happened to 53-year-old farmer Elvia Cort√©s on May 15, 2000. Don&apos;t google it until after you see the movie, lest the ending be ruined for you. Even so, you might be shocked to see how little information there is on the incident, and some of it inaccurate, such as blaming FARC, a militant group of Marxist revolutionaries. As this film shows, it was no grandiose terrorist plot. We see in the first 10 minutes that it was a case of common criminal violence over a petty 15 million pesos ($7000). Again, no elaborate spy stories or conspiracy theories are required; Stathoulopoulos is showing us a simple crime and its not- so-simple effect on people. This is storytelling stripped to the bone, and it works.\n\nEven though there are tons of amateur &quot;raw footage&quot; thrillers flooding the movie world, there is nothing amateur about &quot;PVC-1&quot;. Don&apos;t expect some shaky-cam &quot;Blair Witch&quot; nonsense designed to beat your mind into submission. The cinematography here is smooth and deliberate, and every camera movement for 90 minutes is carefully planned in order to keep the story &amp; themes moving forward. I know I said that this film is raw &amp; simple, but it still touches on some deep thoughts. In particular, it makes us wonder, what is the role of faith &amp; religion during terrible times? Other moments rely on excellent silent acting to awaken the philosopher in all of us, like the scene when the policeman is standing alone in an abandoned building, his mind racing like a hamster wheel while, outside, we see traffic continue, business as usual. There are many such poetic moments in &quot;PVC-1&quot;, and for what it aims to accomplish, this film is picture perfect. I haven&apos;t given out a perfect 10 since I saw Orson Welles&apos; &quot;The Trial&quot;, but this film truly deserves it.",

      "reviewBody": "Sinfon√≠a er√≥tica (1980) *** (out of 4)\n\nMartine de Bressac (Lina Romay) is returning home after a stay in a mental hospital. Once there she is told that her husband is having an affair with a young man. Soon the two men are out walking in the woods when they come across a young nun (Susan Hemingway) who has been raped. Before long Martine is slipping more into a mental state while the other three are planning her murder.\n\nI&apos;ve seen over a hundred and fifty films from Spanish director Jess Franco and he&apos;s made some great ones and some truly awful ones. Out of all of the films I&apos;ve seen I&apos;d say that SINFORNIA EROTICA takes the number one spot for his most underrated. If you&apos;re expecting sleaze, nudity, sex and violence then you&apos;re really not going to get that from this film. While the movie does contain some of that there&apos;s no question that this here is an art film and a well-made on at that.\n\nSlightly based on a Marquis de Sade story, the film manages to really come across as a nightmare. Franco&apos;s direction is certianly among the best of his career as he does a great job at really painting a woman&apos;s mental breakdown and the craziness that surrounds her. The film&apos;s cinematography really does a great job with its soft focus to show what a nightmare the lead character is going through. I thought the cinematography really managed to build up a bizarre fever-dream like vision that helped draw you into the picture.\n\nThe film also benefits from some nice performances as well. This includes Romay who doesn&apos;t get a lot of dialogue and instead must act just with her eyes. I really thought this was one of her best roles and one of her finest performances. She&apos;s basically got to just act with her eyes and what&apos;s going on in her troubled mind and I thought the actress was quite believable. Hemingway, who appeared in a handful of films for Franco, has always been one of my favorite actresses of his and she too is extremely good in her role. Both Armando Borges and Mel Rodrigo are good as well.\n\nAs I said, the film contains some nudity and sex as well as some violence but it&apos;s off the screen. The film really doesn&apos;t go for any sort of sleaze and that&apos;s why some people might be bored by it. That&apos;s really too bad because it&apos;s certainly a well-made movie and one of the better ones that Franco made."

Always good to see this in a independent movie.",

At the same time, he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential litigant in a malpractice suit, and to support the shambolic and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected Chief of Staff.\n\nThis is a superior old-fashioned romantic comedy graced by four Grade-A actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first-rate dry, caustic and sarcastic script. Carney steals every scene he&apos;s in and, in the parlance of IMDb, has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen. We are otherwise entertained by the on-off relationship of the two leads and various sub-plots.\n\nLacks the ambition to be a great film, but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re-watchable for its comedic value alone. Deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the DVD or video cassette.",

Add to that Benedict Cumberbatch makes a complex and compelling villain, even if the character does borrow from other sources, including Rutger Hauer in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. \n\nThe humor is funny, the emotional scenes have a real impact, the battles are exciting, the acting is excellent, the plot twists are clever, and the more epic &apos;big&apos; moments are really effective. \n\nThere are flaws; some plot twists can be seen coming a mile off, there are a few painful cheats or jumps in logic, and a handful of too-easy coincidences. But for a big summer blockbuster this has more smarts, style, punch and humanity than most.",

      "reviewBody": "I might have been Alice. Or was I too fearful, too cared for, too lost in myself? Was I born at the wrong time? When I watch this film, I&apos;m reminded of a line from another of director Wim Wenders&apos; films: &quot;Life is in colour, but black &amp; white is more realistic&quot;. I&apos;m still not sure if I believe that, but there are memories that seem more a thing of light and shadow than of colour. And this is, after all, a black &amp; white film. &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot; is as much about its other main character, Philip Winter, as Alice herself. Him, I have been. Lost out on the highways of New Brunswick and Maine, lonely hotel holidays all by myself with no one to comfort or to talk with. I wanted to smash that television just as he does in an early scene, but it was my only companion through the long night ahead.\n\n&quot;Alice in the Cities&quot; is the first of three consecutive films by Wim Wenders about the open road, each starring R√ºdiger Vogler as a similar, if not identical character. The second, &quot;The Wrong Movement&quot; (Falsche Bewegung) (1975), is an incredibly difficult slog of total human alienation. The third, and much better than the second film, &quot;Kings of the Road&quot; (Im Lauf der Zeit) (1976) is similar to this one, as Mr. Winter continues his journeys through the German countryside.\n\nThis is a film about childhood relationships - not those we have with our peers, but those of a greater age. This makes perfect sense to me, as I would without fail seek out the company of an adult over the fleeting fancies of ones closer to me. To me, anything past fully grown would blur together, all except for the very old. Philip isn&apos;t comfortable with children, just as I have become over time. It is a hallmark of those who feel that they have never outgrown their own childhood, who feel so lost inside the adult world that the past feels foreign to a present that will never fit. Their belief that living in the future is futile keeps them grounded in today, their only salvation from a life spent dreaming.\n\nReality is harsh in &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot;. The release comes where life lives. The precious and precocious sensation of human interaction runs like a vein through the center of everything. This is a story suitable for anyone, not because it holds back, but because it is all in. In love with the very same world it fears, holding the hands of the same dream on whose feet it steps on. Like we all do in life. This film feels exactly like those first two or three years of your earliest memories. If you let it, you&apos;ll be taken further back than you&apos;d have ever imagined.",

      "reviewBody": "The movies have depicted the hereafter in varied ways over the years. From the bleached white warehouses of Powell and Pressburger&apos;s &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; in 1946 and Warren Beatty&apos;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; in 1978 to ‚Äì for me ‚Äì the peak of the game: Vincent Ward&apos;s mawkish but gorgeously rendered oil-paint version of heaven in 1998&apos;s &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;. Joel Schmacher&apos;s 1990&apos;s &quot;Flatliners&quot; saw a set of &quot;brat pack&quot; movie names of the day (including Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland) as experimenting trainee doctors, cheating death to experience the afterlife and getting more than they bargained for. The depictions of the afterlife were unmemorable: in that I don&apos;t remember them much! (I think there was some sort of spooky tree involved, but that&apos;s about it!)\n\nBut the concept was sufficiently enticing ‚Äì who isn&apos;t a little bit intrigued by the question of &quot;what&apos;s beyond&quot;? ‚Äì that Cross Creek Pictures thought it worthy of dusting off and giving it another outing in pursuit of dirty lucre. But unfortunately this offering adds little to the property&apos;s reputation. \n\nIn this version, the lead role is headed up by Ellen Page (&quot;Inception&quot;) who is a great actress¬Ö too good for this stuff. Also in that category is Diego Luna, who really made an impact in &quot;Rogue One&quot; but here has little to work with in terms of backstory. The remaining three doctors ‚Äì Nina Dobrev as &quot;the sexy one&quot;; James Norton (&quot;War and Peace&quot;) as &quot;the posh boy&quot; and Kiersey Clemons as the &quot;cute but repressed one&quot;, all have even less backstory and struggle to make a great impact. \n\nAlso putting in an appearance, as the one link from the original film, is Kiefer Sutherland as a senior member of the teaching staff. But he&apos;s not playing the same character (that WOULD have been a bloody miracle!) and although Sutherland adds gravitas he really is given criminally little to do. What was director Niels Arden Oplev (&quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;) thinking?\n\nIn terms of the story, it&apos;s pretty much a re-hash of Peter Filardi&apos;s original, with Ben Ripley (&quot;Source Code&quot;) adding a few minor tweaks to the screenplay to update it for the current generation. But I will levy the same criticism of this film as I levied at the recent Stephen King adaptation of &quot;It&quot;: for horror to work well it need to obey some decent &apos;rules of physics&apos; and although most of the scenes work (since a lot of the &quot;action&quot; is sensibly based inside the character&apos;s heads) there are the occasional linkages to the &apos;real world&apos; that generate a &quot;WTF???&quot; response. A seemingly indestructible Mini car (which is also clearly untraceable by the police!) and a knife incident at the dockside are two cases in point. \n\nIs there anything good to say about this film? Well, there are certainly a few tense moments that make the hairs on your neck at least start to stand to attention. But these are few and far between, amongst a sea of movie &apos;meh&apos;. It&apos;s certainly not going to be the worst film I see this year, since at least I wasn&apos;t completely bored for the two hours. But I won&apos;t remember this one in a few weeks. As a summary in the form of a &quot;Black Adder&quot; quote, it&apos;s all a bit like a broken pencil¬Ö.. pointless.\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

      "reviewBody": "A frumpy cleaning woman well into middle age is discovered by an art critic to be a painter with talent comparable to Vincent Van Gogh. Her story is told in the riveting Seraphine, directed by Martin Provost and winner of seven C√©sars, the French version of the Oscars, including a best actress award for Yolande Moreau. With a screenplay by Martin Provost and Marc Abdelnour, the film is set in the village of Senlis outside of Paris where S√©raphine Louis (Yolande Moreau) lives alone and must take odd jobs just to pay for her painting supplies. S√©raphine is a visionary, a devout Catholic who believes she is guided by a guardian angel and her exotic paintings of flowers and plants describe her feelings of closeness to spirit.\n\nTreated with disdain by her condescending employer, her life takes on new meaning when a tenant, German art critic Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) hires S√©raphine to clean for him and accidentally discovers one of her paintings that her boss had tossed aside. A champion of modern &quot;primitvist&quot; artists who is credited with early recognition of Picasso and Rousseau, Uhde is portrayed by Tukur as a quiet, unassuming man who lives with his sister and a gay lover. He recognizes S√©raphine&apos;s talent but never shows much enthusiasm, preferring to keep their relationship on a very business-like basis.\n\nImpressed by Seraphine&apos;s passionate art, Uhde offers to become her patron but, feeling estranged in France, must soon leave the country to return to Germany as the First World War begins. Although S√©raphine continues to paint, she has no connection with Uhde until the latter part of the 1920s when he provides her with the means to quit her job and paint full time. Unfortunately, her grip on reality falters and she is soon hospitalized after indulging in spending sprees on a wedding dress and purchase of a large mansion. One of the saddest scenes in the film is that of S√©raphine dressed in a full wedding gown, going door to door giving her away her possessions.\n\nProvost in S√©raphine captures the artist&apos;s mystical nature and her close bond with nature that shows up in her works, which are still exhibited in many of the world&apos;s museums. She is shown hugging trees, climbing them, and standing as a tiny speck beneath a towering shade tree. One scene shows her standing nude in water up to her chest in a nearby river. Provost takes a minimalist approach and the film does not contain much dialogue. The story is told by the silences and facial expressions and the music by Michael Galasso adds richness to the experience. Fully capturing the eternal mystery of the creative process, S√©raphine itself is a work of art.",

      "reviewBody": "The days of Harley-Davidsons mastering the road are over. Nowadays color and plastic coat the fastest and most coveted motorcycles in the land, and `Biker Boyz&apos; heralds the passing with unrestrained glee.\n\nSet among African-American biker clubs in Southern California, the film follows Kid (Derek Luke), a prodigious young motorcycle racer, in his quest for the title of `King of Cali,&apos; currently held by Smoke (Lawrence Fishburne), leader of the Black Knights bike club. Smoke hesitates in accepting Kid&apos;s challenges, citing that Kid is not a member of a legitimate club. In one scene, Kid addresses Smoke&apos;s assistant with anger and frustration: `Are you racing? Or are you just blowin&apos; smoke?&apos; Kid begins his own club (the aptly named `Biker Boyz&apos;) and sets out for the crown of fastest biker. The rest of the film follows a sort of formula we have seen before, with the underdog taking on the inhumanly skilled antagonist at the end. Though the plot is weak, the talent both onscreen and off push the film into something the script alone could not hold. The actors, for the most part, excel in their respective roles. Fishburne turns what may have been a trivial role into one exuding sincerity and masculinity, holding to an effectively pensive and reserved demeanor. His presence on the screen legitimizes the film as not just another `Days of Thunder.&apos; Fishburne&apos;s charisma must have extended to the rest of the cast, as even Kid Rock, who made his film debut in 2001&apos;s deplorable `Joe Dirt,&apos; portrays his character with gusto and road-wise scruffiness. Director Reggie Rock Bythewood makes his presence felt in the film. Bythewood made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with his debut `Dancing in September.&apos; With `Biker Boyz,&apos; he manages to pull off something slightly extraordinary: he makes motorcycle racing entertaining. The camera freewheels around smoking tires, colorful racing suits and bouncing nightclubs with dizzying ease. His film is loosely based on a feature from the Los Angeles New Times on the biking subculture in California, and Bythewood tries to bring a sense of biker culture to the screen. The nonfiction foundation of the film shines through, displaying a bizarre sense of camaraderie between cyclists similar to that of a fraternal order.\n\nDespite its basically inane premise, the movie is not all bad. The poor title and plot outline summons memories of `Rollerball&apos; and the like, but do not be deceived. `Biker Boyz&apos; inspires some sense of genuine excitement and intrigue. As entertainment, it works on the same level as last year&apos;s `Spider-Man.&apos; It cannot be praised as a piece of art, but the craftsmanship of the film is undeniable, which grants it a begrudged recommendation.",

      "reviewBody": "I first went to see this film almost by accident. Some friends were going, &amp; it happened that Philip Glass was due to be in the cinema for an after-screening interview. I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of Philip Glass, I&apos;d never heard of Koyaanisqatsi or Godfrey Reggio: but what the hell, I went along, expecting some sort of nicely-filmed but vaguely-boring worthy documentary.\n\nAn hour &amp; a half later, I was - and I&apos;m having to try very hard to find adjectives here - in fact I&apos;m failing. It was The-Thing-That-You-Can&apos;t-Even-Tell-Someone-What-It-Is. Completely transfixed, transported, for 90 minutes of my life.\n\nThis film has no dialogue. It has no actors, apart from everyone &amp; everything that Ron Fricke&apos;s camera touches. It has no plot, apart from just the simple, complex, unfolding story of the world.\n\nThe truth is, of all the films that people feel have really made an impact on their lives - and you only need to read through this lengthy thread to see how many of those people there are - this is one of the hardest to communicate to someone who hasn&apos;t actually seen it. You can compare it, perhaps, to things they might have seen - but there aren&apos;t that many to compare to. It has a kind of poetry on a whole different level from, for example, Man with a Movie Camera. The only things that spring to mind for me are Orphee or Last Year at Marienbad, but these are completely different kinds of movie, and even people who don&apos;t like them might be totally taken apart by Koyaanisqatsi.\n\nSure you could - rightly - use phrases like &quot;breathtaking cinematography&quot; or &quot;unforgettable images&quot;. You could praise the music (which really opened my ears to Philip Glass). You could point out, as many have done, how the film made you look again at the world, &amp; at your own place in it. Or you could try to relay its &quot;environmental&quot; message - and there are people, especially those who take any implied criticism of our species&apos; waste and cruelty as a kind of personal insult, who will not like that message.\n\nBut none of these things would come close to capturing what makes this film so special. Like trying to explain &quot;red&quot; to someone who&apos;s never seen colours. You have to experience it. If possible in a cinema, sitting right down at the front, completely immersed in the screen and its images.\n\nI know I&apos;ll never forget the first time I saw it. You might not either.",

Its not the scariest movie (it has a audience rating age 14), but it has its doses of panic and pure agony. The film reflects and depicts with accuracy the young hip Brazilian culture and it makes fun of it, as do many horror films. \n\nIts not a Hitchcock movie, and it could not be as it was shot &quot;Blair Witch&quot; style for under $25 thousand and went from concept to screen in less then a year. But it should not be dismissed either as it has earned its place in the Brazilian film history books. \n\nThe director and crew should be hailed for taking the risk and making a film without the help of government money (99% of films in Brazil are shot with soft - government money) and for exploring the horror genre, something forgotten by young Brazilian filmmakers. \n\nAudience reactions have been mixed as the film was part of a large transmidia project (also a first for a Brazilian film) that ran for a year on the web prior to the release of the movie. Due to this fact older and more cinematic audiences did not understand the full implication of the film. Younger audiences have approved the film and haild it as the film that will kick start horror films in Brazil. Released theatrically on 12/09/2011.",

      "name": "A fine first film with nice performances",
      "reviewBody": "In Scott Caan&apos;s first feature, Dallas 362, you can see the same thing as was seen in his first play (&apos;Almost Love&apos;), the raw elements of a budding talent.  Caan, son of actor James Caan, wrote and directed the deceptively simple buddy movie and in which he also stars along with Shawn Hatosy, Jeff Goldblum, and Kelly Lynch.  The film, shot on a low budget on Locations in LA, manages to create a world of its own, and one in which you finally care about these flawed characters, and without falling into any of a number of possible clich√©s of this kind of filmmaking.\n\nThe film follows two close friends, Rusty (played by Hatosy) and Dallas (Caan), who call themselves `brothers&apos; and are constantly becoming involved in bar fights, repeatedly being bailed out of jail by Rusty&apos;s mother, played by Kelly Lynch.  Rusty wants to grow up but can&apos;t seem to break out of this pattern.  Goldblum plays the mother&apos;s boyfriend who is a therapist and begins seeing Rusty as a favor to his mother.  The obvious complications of this triangle come out early and are resolved in a very honest and truthful manner, and Goldblum gives a surprisingly fresh and satisfying performance.\n\nThe relationship of the friends is obvious from the beginning, and the fact that you see the problems coming makes them no less compelling.  In fact, Caan has succeeded in something that is really quite difficult.  As Dallas begins to dabble in ideas of larger crimes, we see coming the time when guns will come out (and they do), but even as it all happens he manages to keep the focus on the characters and not on the action.   We care about what will happen to these flawed characters.  This is a real strength of this film.\n\n In fact, all of the performances are good here (including a nice turn by Val Lauren).  And the film has the great virtue that it is evenly paced and not overly long.  Caan manages the tricky task of working on both sides of the camera well, although this is definitely more a movie of characters and performances rather than a cinematic vision.  The photography is effective for the story and shows some of the budget constraints, but it also does not call attention to itself.   Undoubtedly Caan will develop as a director over time, but this is a very respectable first effort."

      "reviewBody": "The mysterious sounding music of the main title when the film starts sets the pace for the whole movie, which is laid-back yet enchanting (especially if watched at night).\n\nIt is not hardly a typical space battle type picture so this should not be expected. As a matter of fact this movie shows a much more realistic viewing of what space travel will be like when it finally becomes common place. For example the rockets are propelled by some type of gas, and permission has to be given from mission control before engines are started, and rocket courses and accelerations have to take into account things like planet gravity and possible g forces on the crew.\n\nThe main characters are interesting and even though it is overdubbed the dialog is good, with a few exceptions which are fun to laugh at. The acting by Claude Rains is very good, and you can actually feel sympathy for professor Benson, who has nothing to keep him going but science (and Eve though he finds it hard to admit it even to himself).\n\nThe story is interesting and has a few twists to it that keep things moving along. The movie also presents an interesting commentary on possible future government-military-industrial and international organization. This movie might not fit everyone&apos;s taste, yet people who sometimes enjoy laid-back atmospheric fantasies should enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "Wonderfully original, even after all this time, due to the matchless dialog of Tennessee Williams and the superb performances of the three principals, Karl Malden, Carroll Baker and Eli Wallach. Wickedly funny, sly and loopy all at the same time. A view of Southern white trash which only Tennessee Williams could have penned. Carroll Baker in a first class performance as the still-virginal but sexually precocious Baby Doll, married for two years but refusing to consummate her marriage until her twentieth birthday, looming large. Karl Malden as the frustrated husband, panting to get his hands on her, and Eli Wallach as the neighbor, determined to seduce Baby Doll before Malden, in revenge for Malden&apos;s burning down his cotton gin. Totally off the wall characterization with rich, witty dialog that constantly takes one by surprise. Watching Malden and Baker&apos;s characters with their dumber than dumber take on things (that totally cracks one up at their sheer stupidity!) one wonders just how much in-breeding Williams had in mind when he invented these people. Even Mildred Dunnock, as the minor fourth character of the ensemble, a batty aunt, has a full share of crazy antics that almost has one falling on the floor. Eli Wallach turns in a sly, smoother than smooth performance as the potential seducer that is wonderfully nuanced. When the movie first appeared is was condemned by the Catholic Church. Apparently there are critics who still uphold those initial views and would prefer to return to the time of total censorship than adopt a more realistic view of life. Baby Doll is not an indecent movie and never was. What it is is a glorious black comedy that has a place amongst the best works that Williams ever produced. Last, but not least, kudos to director Elia Kazan, who passed away on the very evening that this viewer was privileged to finally get to see this movie. This is definitely one for the collection!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;L&apos;Amour Fou&quot; is a documentary narrated by Yves Saint Laurent&apos;s romantic and business partner Pierre Berge about the life they shared for 50 years, focusing naturally on Saint Laurent&apos;s work but perhaps more surprisingly on the vast collection of paintings, sculptures and objects d&apos;art that they amassed over their years together and, of course, on the love they had for each other. Theirs was a marriage of sorts, perhaps not made in heaven, but enduring and certainly passionate, a testament not just to the stability of gay relationships but of the ability to survive a life lived almost entirely in the spotlight, (though, of course, there were as many guns as roses in the relationship).\n\nIt&apos;s very simply made, (the director is Pierre Thoretton), with no narration other than Berge&apos;s and a few other talking heads from Saint Laurent&apos;s life. We are never nudged in any direction but left to make up our own minds. If the film has a fault it&apos;s that it never settles on any one point of view and in the end leaves us feeling rather chilly.",

      "reviewBody": "England in the 1700&apos;s, (1745 to be exact) was not a nice place.  The rich were all made up to the eyeballs with ludicrous hair and cuffs you could hide a poodle in.  They did, however smell a little better than the poor, who were lucky if they made it through the day without a vital appendage falling off in the street.\n\nIt is to this world that the audience watching Plunkett and Macleane are introduced.  It&apos;s not pretty, but it&apos;s very believable and prepares you to accept the lengths to which people will go to clamber from the muck to a better life.\n\nThrown together through circumstance, Macleane, a semi-respectable gentleman who spends too much on women and gambling and Plunkett, a common criminal with more than a few tricks up his sleeve, find that they can rob together successfully as partners.  So they do.  A lot.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of good ideas in the film, primarily the concept of turning the idea of 18th Century English nobility on its head and making it seem little more than an excuse to wear wigs and lipstick.  A refreshing change in these days of Merchant Ivory productions and hey-nonny snooze.\n\nThen there&apos;s the obligatory love interest, Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) and the vicious baddie, in the form of the Thief Taker General Chance, played with sadistic relish by Ken Stott.  Both perform well, but it&apos;s up to the two leads, and the chemistry that worked well in Trainspotting to steal the show.  Being Highwaymen, they steal it with ease, commanding each scene with humour and grit in equal proportions.  Some moments of the film are laugh out loud funny, while others border on the disgusting.  Always funny and compelling as an action movie, (the love story is left firmly in second place) Plunkett &amp; Macleane is great fun.  Though the efforts of the excellent cast and director Jake Scott, we have another British hit on our hands.\n\nAll in all, to blatantly rip off a line from the film:\n\n&quot;It was fantastic and I had a bloody good laugh!&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "Charles Laughton who made a career of playing tortured and twisted men goes one better here as Sir Simon de Canterville who haunts stately Canterville Manor until another Canterville performs a heroic deed and frees him from being earthbound.\n\nThe first part of the film shows the incident where Sir Simon turns tail and runs from a duel he got involved in. Out of shame and embarrassment, his father bricked him up in a room in the manor and pronounced the aforementioned curse upon him.\n\nBreaking that curse is easier said than done because the cowardice was passed down several generations from Stuart England to World War II.\n\nEnter a platoon of American rangers quartered at the manor house where the current lady of the manor, Margaret O&apos;Brien is like so many in Great Britain in those years, playing host to American GIs. One in that platoon is a distant cousin from America, Robert Young. Will he perform the deed that frees Charles Laughton? Watch the film and find out.\n\nRobert Young and Margaret O&apos;Brien are fine, but it is the multi-talented Mr. Laughton who carries this film. This is a difficult part and only an actor of real talent and skill could carry it off. The comic elements are nicely done, but Laughton also has to project an air of resigned sadness at the fate he&apos;s been cursed with. And Mr. Laughton bares the tortured soul of Simon de Canterville for all to see.\n\nThis is a story originally written by Oscar Wilde and nicely updated for World War II moviegoers. And it&apos;s still a fine piece of film making for today&apos;s audience.",

And Matthew Rhys matches her stride for stride... the two of them making this one of the most enjoyable rom-com&apos;s of the year. Sure it&apos;s the totally predictable formula, but it&apos;s fairly well written, and the overall cast is solid.

      "reviewBody": "Henry Jaglom has often been accused, justifiably, of self indulgent movie making. &quot;A Safe Place&quot; is no exception, yet here it&apos;s an indulgence in experimenting with cinematic form itself. As always with Jaglom, it&apos;s a pretty mixed bag. There are scenes with some striking moments, but many which ramble on for much too long.\n\nThe question remains does this experiment work ? The answer has to be ¬ñ no. But the attempt itself is not without interest. While much of the film will certainly test your patience, the rewards are there, though not as predominant as to make one want to champion this as a film that should be seen.\n\nThe film is centered round Tuesday Weld. Weld has always been something of an enigma. The movie persona of her earlier films established her firmly in the mind of the public as yet another pretty blonde. It took her a long time to shake this off. This need to find herself as an actress to be reckoned with must surely have drawn her to this project, written and directed by a newcomer. Her beauty and talent are in abundance here. This may have led to her next big role, made the following year; &quot;Play It As It Lays&quot;. Sadly, despite a great performance, Weld never seemed to be able to prove her worth to the wider public or indeed the studios and moved towards a career in mainstream television movies, in which she still managed to shine.\n\n&quot;A Safe Place&quot; boasts an intriguing cast. Alongside Weld is Orson Welles, a close friend of Jaglom&apos;s, obviously having much fun as a magician of sorts as well as a young and as always devilish, Jack Nicholson. Jaglom allows them much room for improvisation. He once related having written a scene for Nicholson and Weld; it somehow wasn&apos;t working. His feeling was that knowing them personally, they were both far more interesting people than the scene he had written for them showed. He simply let them improvise their dialog.\n\n&quot;A Safe Place&quot; is the kind of film that sounds more interesting than is actually the case. I for one, despite being in favor of much of Jaglom&apos;s work and certainly that of Welles, Nicholson and Weld, am reticent in recommending it. For those with special interest in these people or the times, (New York, 1971), there will be points of interest but I must admit to being ultimately somewhat let down to what I sensed could have been far more than what I found."

Usually, in these kinds of films you expect violence, suspense, and a little gore and some T&amp;A. The violence was poorly executed, the &quot;suspense&quot; was laughable, there was NO gore, and the T&amp;A is plentiful IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES, then, NOTHING. At least one of these things, properly done would have at least made it watchable. \n\nTo say at least one nice thing about it, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up. If everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun, no pun intended.",

      "reviewBody": "Do not be deceived - I&apos;ll start with the low points and rise to apotheosis. Do not miss this flick!\n\nSurprisingly enough, gay men and women have been allowed to serve in the Israeli army for over 2 decades now (for very pragmatic reasons, I&apos;m sure). The army actually authorized the making of this film, based on a true story. Eytan Fox follows up with his favorite theme of sexual identity within the ranks of the army: here we see a gay couple, two officers, whose love shares its space with an ever-escalating Israelo-Arab conflict. The movie is filmed in this army outpost in the mountains bordering Lebanon, in the middle of Winter (thus the snow, that one seldom relates to the Middle East). \n\nThe theme is ambitious. Yet, it turns out that, for commercial reasons, the movie&apos;s 65 minutes elapse too fast. There is no time to develop the story. Not the story of the conflict, not the story of the different characters - so many deeply interesting -, and especially not the story of Yossi and Jagger. And boy, would we like to know more about them! These 65 minutes may have been OK for the theatre play that staged in Tel Aviv before the movie opened, but on screen it just leaves your mouth watering for more. I wished some scenes would have been deeper and more intense (the get-together at the end, or that last key-scene at night). \n\nDespite all this, if you can forgive small formal nuisances, and get over that irritating camera-in-hand that works for Dogma but not for Fox, this film is a must-see! For the first 30 minutes of it, I had a disbelieving smile on my lips, and really wanted to joint the Israeli army - mind you, I&apos;m neither Jewish, nor Israeli, and they would never take me! Yet life in the barracks seems so laid-back and so easy-going , so much in contrast with the madness of the conflict, with crazy girls and sexy boys, cheesy music in Hebrew and techno parties in the mountain clusters, white snow and great landscape, wild rabbits and sushi at dinner... Provided my officers looked as cute and handsome and so-damn-sexy-and-hugable-Yehudi-Levi (Jagger), of course I would enlist.\n\nMild as it may seem at times, it&apos;s perhaps the most consequent movie on a gay theme that I have ever seen. No tragic queens, no dramatic depressions and people who threaten to slid their wrists open. Yossi &amp; Jagger&apos;s love is real and palpable, even if semi-secret (I think everyone new, anyway). The actors are superb, natural-born to the task, and that shows. One can easily relate with many of the characters - people whom we forget are people, just because they are in the army, just because they are in a war. The scene where Yossi and Jagger kiss in the snow is surprising, and by far the most sensuous thing I&apos;ve seen in cinema in years! Absolutely delicious, playful, teasing, masterful. A classic in the future, I&apos;m sure! Maybe because of that particular scene, one can survive as a viewer to the end of the movie, and still feel light as a feather. It all seems to end up in a good note, in spite of the circumstances.\n\nThe film as is, is not brilliant, but is at times a strike of genius! It&apos;s also a splash in the pond, showing you the dichotomies of a society we grew to relate with war and nothing else. Yossi &amp; Jagger is a tender, sweet, sensuous, pure, honest, scrumptious, beautiful, sexy and consequent movie. I am a fan of Eytan Fox as of tonight, no doubt about that! Watch it, watch it, watch it!!! (the extras on the DVD give you even greater insight into his work). The storyline won&apos;t leave you that soon, and the main theme-song will replay on your head for weeks to come... cheesy and queenly as it may be (&apos;Come&apos;, by Rita)! \n\nWatching a film like this oddly makes you feel as good as when you watched &apos;Amelie&apos;! I don&apos;t say this often, but I&apos;d be ready to watch it all over again.",

      "reviewBody": "Benno (Fabian Kr√ºger) wakes up every morning to discover - no not that he has turned into a giant vermin - but that he is turning into sand. \n\nWhat makes a work Kafkaesque? The lack of reasonable explanation for events, the deliberate way the narrative eschews our expectations of character and plot, the absurdism of the situation, and possibly, the sense of deeper symbolism behind the story. Despite appearances, this film is not Kafkaesque. It is an extremely well-made film, highly stylistic, and shot with care, but it is no Kafka. \n\nThere is a scene which inadvertently gives this secret away. Benno visits his psychiater and explains to him &quot;I am loosing sand&quot;. The psychiater rubs his chin and replies something to the effect of, &quot;that is a very good metaphor&quot;. \n\n&quot;But I really am loosing sand!&quot; Benno exclaims, &quot;I&apos;m not using a metaphor.&quot; \n\nThe psychiater looks curiously at Benno, pauses, and slowly replies: &quot;Hmmm, that is a very good image.&quot;\n\nThis film is indeed a very good image - but aside from its absurdity I can detect no underlying meaning. Is the subtext that distressed classical musicians should never give up? That we should be true to our dreams, lest our corporeal forms disintegrate like grains blown apart by the winds of the world? I should hope not. I doubt if Kafka wrote this he would write up an ending as neatly packaged and satisfying as the one we are asked to accept.\n\nThis is really, at the end of the day, more of a light-hearted comedic romp. It is the Swiss equivalent Jim Carrey&apos;s usual story arc in a film like Yes Man or Liar Liar. (This will ring nostalgic once it is revealed the mechanics of the Sandman&apos;s condition.) Visually, there are some stunningly conceived dream sequences here, delicately shot with a soft sun-baked palette. There are a fair few laughs in it too. But don&apos;t expect not to expect an explanation - this is no film of Kafka; Benno is no Gregor Samsa.",

The t.a.l.k.i.n.g. Reminded me of some older Chinese-English dubbed films, and some lines reminded me of the Kung Fu series of the 70&apos;s. The production was mainly from a non-English base, so it is not too surprising that the dialogue was rather flat and stilted, rather than chatty in natural style.\n\nIt was hardly a serious film, but rather earth-hugging, with a few humorous lines. Some nice landscape and herd scenes. Perhaps best for a young audience.",

      "reviewBody": "Plot: In a thrilling turn of events, an international hacker group launches a devastating attack on a Bank, crippling all financial transactions and leaving millions of people&apos;s money inaccessible. Their audacious demand: the immediate surrender of PLS71. The mystery shrouding PLS71 deepens, as the hackers&apos; audacity in targeting an entire nation&apos;s banking system raises questions about their true motives. Is this merely the beginning of their demands, or is there a larger, hidden agenda at play? Could this be a diversion, masking their true target? And what exactly is the significance of Antarjal-21, the mega-project involving Bangladesh? Why are these hackers so determined to seize control of it?\n\nThe story of &quot;Antarjal&quot; can be narrated in various ways, whether as a high-stakes conflict pitting a group of hackers against the entire nation of Bangladesh or as the journey of a villain relentlessly pursuing control over Bangladesh&apos;s visionary project, Antarjal-21. The battle between offensive and defensive tactics, at times, offers gripping suspense.\n\nDirector: Renowned for his grand-scale productions and unwavering commitment to quality, Dipankar Dipon maintains his signature style in &quot;Antarjal.&quot; The unexpected twist he introduces towards the story&apos;s conclusion lingers in the viewer&apos;s memory. Dipon skillfully portrays the complexities of modern times with a straightforward narrative. While the thriller occasionally meanders due to plot and character development, Dipon keeps the focus firmly on the central storyline.\n\nCast: Siam delivers a compelling performance as Lumin, a programmer haunted by his troubled past. Although his on-screen chemistry with Sunehra is somewhat limited, their pairing is a welcome sight. ABM Sumon brings vibrancy to his role, while Mim successfully embodies her character. Keto bhai&apos;s commendable performance deserves praise, with one actor&apos;s surprise contribution best left unspoiled for the audience to discover in the cinema hall.\n\nVisual Effects and Product Placement: The visual effects exhibit moments of brilliance but also show inconsistency. Some instances of product placement appear unnecessary, while others seamlessly integrate with the narrative.\n\nWith &quot;Antarjal,&quot; Dipankar Dipon introduces a groundbreaking trend in Bangladeshi cinema. The film explores the realms of cybercrime, the dark web, and the intricate world of the internet, marking a departure from conventional cinema in Bangladesh. By simplifying complex themes, &quot;Antarjal&quot; serves as a guidepost for future films in this genre, offering audiences a thrilling and thought-provoking experience.",

      "reviewBody": "Although I think that along with Troll with Central Park that this is one of the weaker Don Bluth movies, I personally don&apos;t think it is that bad. When you compare the animation to gems like the Secret of Nimh and American Tail, you do think it is disappointing. Some of it, and I am putting emphasis on the some, was a bit Saturday-morning standard, and some of the minor characters were drawn rather weirdly. The non-animated parts were quite jarring to be honest with you, and seemed rather flat. Though i will say the animation is nowhere near as bad as people have said it is. I liked the incidental music, not so much the songs, they just seemed rather lacklustre as I am used to hearing Barry Manilow and Cynthia Weil songs, not Elvis-style ones. Although there was some excellent singing from Glenn Campbell, the songs&apos; lyrics were rather mediocre. Also the owl&apos;s songs, or recitatives as I prefer to call them, sounded the same every time. However the voice overs were the redeeming merits. We all know from Disney classics such as Robin Hood and the Jungle Book, that Phil Harris is very talented at singing and acting, and he was put to good use here as Patou,(&quot;you&apos;re rocking the boat&quot;) although his narration did get distracting after a while, as the story is admittedly too heavily reliant on the narration. The narration in fact was to me more of a mini-commentary, that had been over simplified. However, Chistopher Plummer was wonderful as the voice of the Duke,(&quot;if I kill my nephew, would it be murder or charity?&quot;) who wasn&apos;t only the best character, but one of the better Bluth villains, he was really evil in some scenes, like when you first meet him. His performance was worth an award, it was so good. I also liked Edmund and Goldie, Chanticlair was very likable and the Duke&apos;s nephew was hilarious in some scenes, like when he screams Annihilation. In conclusion, one of the weaker Bluth movies, does have a number of redeeming merits, and not that bad. Anyone who&apos;s seen the secret of Nimh sequel will know how awful that was. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

I am very happy to say this movie brings the Rocky series to the rightful close that the fifth left so empty. This movie isn&apos;t so much about the boxing itself, but getting back to the roots of the Rocky story...that determination and courage with the love and help of others makes Rocky a winner no matter what.\n\nThis movie is rated PG, and parents will be happy to see that the graphic nature of boxing has been toned down quite a bit in this movie compared to others in the series. If you&apos;re looking for a touching family movie with a powerful message, Rocky Balboa is definitely a movie to see. I think adults and children over the age of 10 will throughly enjoy this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is based on the TV series/documentaries called &quot;J&apos;irai dormir chez vous&quot; (I will sleep at your home)in which Antoine de Maximy is traveling around the world, with the aim to meet people and discover their way of life, and perhaps spend the night in their home.\n\nThis time, Antoine de Maximy is traveling the USA during three months, from the east coast to the west coast, meeting a bunch of fantastic people, from various horizons. The result is a very brilliant kind of road trip, often humorous and sometimes very moving. We are in front of a depiction of the United States trough the eyes of a wanderer meeting all sorts of Americans (I don&apos;t want to spoil anything, but believe me there are crazy moments - Charlie and his cat !). What makes this kind of documentary so efficient is the way the trip is done : The director is alone, with simply 3 cameras with him and nothing is planned. As a result, it is more an kind of direct experience of the true nature of human being in itself than a documentary about it.\n\nTo my mind, and to a certain extend, more than being worth watching for spending a great time with the very friendly Antoine, this documentary is a real portrait of a picturesque America.\n\nI had the privilege to see this movie at a preview in Nancy (France), with a debate with the director himself, Antoine de Maximy, and I must say this guy is really awesome and is as friendly in real life than in his movies. If, like me, you enjoyed the TV shows, you will love the movie. If you never saw the TV shows, you should really go watch &quot;J&apos;Irai dormir √† Hollywood&quot; and have the chance to experience a real outstanding new kind of social and cultural documentary.",

      "name": "Colonialist Tripe Undermined and Lifted by Crafty Arliss",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Green Goddess&quot; is a dated piece of colonialist exotica--one of those old-time melodramas hyper-concerned with the purity of white women in the face of lascivious racial others. Its saving grace is the performance by George Arliss as the Raja. Besides acting circles around the rest of the cast--seemingly being the only one here capable of a wry expression or sly mugging for the camera--the cunning he brings to his character seems to extend to a lack of earnestness to the ridiculous role and scenario. He plays a monarch of a fictional kingdom in the Himalayas who affects English manners, while in truth the English actor is affecting an Eastern stereotype. Because Arliss makes light of the melodramatics and doesn&apos;t shy away from hamming it up, this creaky early talkie may be enjoyed as something of a guilty pleasure. The Academy wasn&apos;t wrong to honor this talent; although he&apos;s usually ascribed for having won the Best Actor Oscar for &quot;Disraeli&quot; (1929), he was doubly nominated that season for this film, too, and I think it his better.\n\nUnfortunately or fortunately, depending on one&apos;s taste for being amused by others&apos; incompetence, nobody else in &quot;The Green Goddess&quot; appears to be in on the joke. Ivan F. Simpson, despite, like Arliss, reprising the same role from stage, to the 1923 silent-film version and here, is unremarkable. The zealots in bald caps look preposterous. Alice Joyce, returning from the 1923 film, as well, along with the other two British colonialists are atrocious. They merely read their stupid lines and feign earnestness. The married couple&apos;s climactic dialogue is laughably bad. Compare it to Arliss&apos;s sardonic quips. Some credit, I suppose, deserves to go to those behind the camera for allowing Arliss to play his part, but given that nobody else on screen comes along suggests he&apos;s the sole talent in this one. Indeed, the rest of &quot;The Green Goddess&quot; is utter rubbish, but Arliss is a delight.",
