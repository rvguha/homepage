Plenty of room on the main side, and straps cinch down to hold items in place. Effortless pull with the long handle and large wheels. Bag is fairly light, so more room for stuff and less concern about bag weight on the airline counter scales. I love the sleek outer fabric, which is weather resistant. Easy to squeeze down the size when scrutinized by wary travel clerks. I’ve taken this to several corners of the globe for two or three weeks at a time — even fit a foldable yoga mat as well. This bag, teamed with my Osprey day pack (both in the cool blue wave color), hold everything I need. Strongly recommend.",

It wobbles from the get go, the screws come loose after a few trips, and on my bag the telescoping mechanism eventually locked completely, rendering the bag unusable. The handle was also the weak point on my last Osprey bag.\n\nIf Osprey were to fix the quality of its handles, this would be a perfect travel bag. This is my 3rd Osprey bag and I&apos;ve traveled to over 140 countries, so I&apos;m particular and certainly put a bag through its paces, but will switch brands after this bag disappointed on my last trip.",

Just a 6 day trip with multiple flights and only overhead storage. I dread having to put it in cargo. So frustrating given the company&apos;s normal quality. \nNot worth the price at all.",

I&apos;m tall so I need length and I was able to get it by extending the suspension system in the back. I found these to be a better fit for me than the other big name fishing company that starts with S. I followed the size chart and found it to be accurate with room to layer underneath.  The included wading belt is substantial and the GoreTex fabric feels top-notch. Hiked a few miles in these in late January to the fishing spot through a few brambles with nary an issue. Thank you Grundens for not putting any teal or pink on these.",

The waders are great quality, have all the right features and include an awesome wading belt.  The issue I had was the sizing appears to be off. I am 5’2” 115lbs and ordered the smallest size available - Small Short.  I was disappointed to find the waders were enormous on me.  There was so much extra fabric around my waist and hips.  Adjusting the wading belt to the correct size caused all the loose fabric to just bunch up.  I shortened all the shoulder straps and the adjustable suspension strap in the back and the waders still hung low around my chest.  Grundens Size Small would be more comparable to Medium in other manufacturers. I know this is their first foray into waders but hopefully Grundens will offer XS for us smaller folk and maybe even a zippered version like the mens in the future.",

        "reviewBody": "The parka is decent but has noticeable flaws, including loose threads and small needle holes around the zipper, which could cause feathers to leak over time. Due to this lack of craftsmanship and attention to detail, I do not recommend this product.\n\nBackcountry&apos;s packaging was equally disappointing. For such an expensive and bulky item, it was shipped in a thin plastic wrap without perforations, making it difficult to open without tools and risking damage to the parka. The parka was squashed into a small ball, and the package even had a dark footprint on it (as shown in the picture), suggesting it had been stepped on during transit. A sturdier box or padded packaging would have provided better protection. Overall, I&apos;m very disappointed in Backcountry&apos;s cost-cutting on shipping at the expense of their customers&apos; satisfaction, especially given the company&apos;s already significant profit margins (we all know how they manipulate the &quot;price match&quot; system).",

However, the fit is where the problems came in.  I don&apos;t have a extra large cranium (normal hat size is 7 3/8).  In order to get a proper fit, the hat is held together by only two of the small buttons/tabs.  Wished my first order had a bit better result.  Will still keep the hat and wear it when I don&apos;t need to worry about it being blown off!  Love the hat, wished it actually was one size fits all or even most!",

I am writing this review for two reasons: \r\n1) Set Expectations\r\n2) Sizing\r\nThe sleeves are not insulated.  So this is something you may take out for a run, but you would not wear to walk around NYC.  It is more like a down vest with a sleeve for wind and rain.   The hood is not insulated either, though this matters less.\r\n\r\nAs for sizing:  I am 5&apos;8&quot; and 145 lbs.   D cup.  So based upon the size charts and models, I purchased a medium.  While this was stretchy enough to zip, it wasn&apos;t sitting in the correct position.   The waist line / back curvature was inching up too high.   When I let it hit naturally and unzipped, there was about a 1&quot; gap, so clearly I would have needed to size up to a L (Large) if I were to have kept the jacket.",

My picture shows where the lining is not down, rather a &apos;rubbery&apos; mesh (not slick) and I read that&apos;s good for climate control next to your body. I had first ordered the Warm Cube Active Novus, synthetic lining everywhere except the hood--but the upper chest was a tight and squished the cubes. The down version with two chest pockets looked fine. No big athletic endeavors these days for me, but this has been a great jacket for snowshoeing, walks and errands. With fleece under it&apos;s been comfortable in the 20-30&apos;s if winds are below 20 mph, otherwise the arms get chilly. It sheds light rain.",

        "reviewBody": "If budget is no object - then this is the filter to buy. I also have the Sawyer Gravity system which costs 4x cheaper. Not just a mere filter, it is a also purifier - and the carbon filter is the icing on the cake and makes the filtered water pleasant tasting. Everything about the package is pure premium. MSR did not skimp on the components and it looks and feel as expensive as it actually is.\n\nOperating is easy. Long term storage is a bit tedious - it is a 1 hour procedure - but I don&apos;t mind doing to ensure tip top performance and longevity.\n\nI know some complain about the flow rate. I never measured - I mean between the claimed 2 mins to reputedly slower 2m30secs in the field .. it is rather irrelevant to me for my use. Which is base camp use where I wont be moving for days. Part of enjoying the outdoors is the being calm about everything and 10L filtered water that comes about a few mins late, is a non-issue for me. And it is really great to produce so much filtered water for camp use effortlessly AND it is supercomforting to know that it is (if the claims are to be believed) the only filter to meet military grade specifications. That seems overkill for me but then why not! \n\nDownsides : long term storage and PRICE. This filter is insanely priced.",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased this filter two years ago for big group and family trips. This year my wife and I took our two kids on an 11-day trip on the Wonderland Trail around Mt. Rainer. The filter performed great, even in dried-up silty/tea-stained lakes. At first, I thought this filter was overkill - many people use squeeze bottle-style filters. Though having to make water for the four of us over 11 days, I was happy I did. Most days, I was filtering around 20 liters of water per day. We filtered into a separate 10l bladder so anyone could quickly fill the cook pot, bottle, or brush teeth.\n\nWhen stowed, the filter, dirty water bag, and extra balder are chunky. However, the weight is negligible once you put this into the group gear pile that gets divvied up between the party. It was consistent with other group gear items in size and weight - rainfly, first-aid kit, stove and fuel, etc.\n\nLastly, the flow rate is brought up on this filter. The filter works great if you hang it high and routinely flush the system. At the end of each season I&apos;ve owned this, I &quot;winterize&quot; the filter by following the disinfecting directions supplied with the filter. This extra step makes a big difference in the overall performance of the filter.",

Even following all instructions in the owners manual and using tap water, the fastest flow rate I could get was 5 minutes per litre. This is 2 1/2 times slower than advertised and about 5 times slower than the regular MSR gravity filter.

It’s light, fits me perfectly, cool with good ventilation and it looks good. The adjuster on back works well and keeps the helmet firmly on my head. Straps are narrow and comfortable. I haven’t used this in really hot weather yet to see how the sweat control works. I’m very happy with the helmet so far.",

I am now at a turning point where I learned this past month how to clip into my pedals and have been practicing on paved trails. Now that I am ready to transition back to the main road, clipped in, I wanted the most secure helmet I could find on the market so I purchased this helmet. It is comfortable out of the box and I hope to never find out how the spherical technology works. I trust the Giro brand. They make helmets for skiing and cycling, two riskiest sports.\n\n**Update** I have worn this helmet a couple times and find it super comfortable. Love it happy with my black helmet!",

I&apos;m not going to return it, I&apos;ll put it to use, but i wouldn&apos;t buy it a second time.\nI got this for a good sale price-had I paid full price, this item would DEFINITELY get returned. Also, runs a bit small, perhaps because it&apos;s &apos;stretch&apos;? I purchased a M as I like my outerwear a bit loose &amp; it sort of tight w a hoodie underneath. \n\nNo coat hook tab, no inside pocket. Construction feels a bit cheap. For something that retails for over 200$, it should have an interior zip pocket. It does have zippers on the outer pockets, so +1 for that. \n\nAll in all, this isn&apos;t all that.",

It&apos;s a perfect vest for working from home to ward off the autumn chills - but much better as an outer layer for cool dry walks. The stretch fabric cuts out any cold spots and looks great. I would suggest that it is sized a little large, but it depends on what you intend to wear under it.",

This doesn&apos;t bother me, and they served me for a long time. I thought I could always glue it back together if needed.\n\nLove the color red, especially with a little dust on it!",

        "reviewBody": "Please don&apos;t discontinue the Kaptiva&apos;s, La Sportiva! Having narrow feet and high arches, I have struggled to find a proper fitting trail running shoe for over a year, and these are the winner. I was on the Bushido 2&apos;s for a few months, but they did not have enough support, and I found myself severely pronating on my right foot. The fit was a little small, since sizing up made my heel slip, and I found them to be very warm. I researched a similar shoe and came across the Kaptiva. Same heel drop but a far superior fit. I followed the other reviews and purchased a full size up, from a 7.5 to an 8.5, and they are perfect. The toe box is roomy, but not overly large, allowing adequate room to spread my toes. The heel cup is high and keeps my heels in place. The tongueless gaiter-like wrap around the foot is fantastic; holds my foot in place but stretches for uphill and downhill terrain. The lacing is simple and doesnt dig into my feet or come loose. The construction is robust and holding up really well on knarly, rocky terrain. Shoes are responsive so you can feel the ground underfoot, but are stiff enough to support the inner foot from pronation. The toe construction is awesome at protecting, and seemless design has no weaknesses to wear down. Breathable, but doesn&apos;t sacrifice any durability. I feel nimble and efficient on these. If I had to be picky, I would ask for more color options. I think this shoes would be great as a racing shoe, but think it can be promoted as an excellent daily trail runner. Please keep this shoe!",

The tongue feature was a great idea too...\n\nAlas: shoe began falling apart on my first 20 miler into the alpine. Over trail to rock and across streams, the external material slowly because unglued from the internal mesh. And now, I&apos;m left with a shoe that looks completely blown out and gets a million tiny rocks stuck between the two layers.\n\nFor a brand whose sticky rubber is so famously durable, I can&apos;t believe La Sportiva skimped on the glue quality here. This was probably my biggest disappointment in gear purchases in years!",

These shoes are awesome! They just felt fast from the minute I first put them on.  No blisters thanks to the sock liner.  I have very narrow feet, so it is tough to find shoes that don&apos;t cause my forefoot to slide around - a very unnerving feeling when running on very technical, rocky trails in the mountains.  The only downside is that they seem to run a tad smaller than other Sportiva shoes and I should have paid more attention to reviews here.  After several runs in them, I purchased a second pair a 1/2 size larger and they fit much better.  If you are on the edge of sizes, size up a little bit.",

The neoprene is extremely soft and flexible, making it easier to paddle and pop up.  The suit is also easy to get into and out of, even with frozen fingers.  There is a slight tradeoff in warmth, so if your body runs cold I would consider getting the Hyperfreak Fire or moving up to the 4/3.\r\n\r\nRegarding fit, I&apos;m 5&apos;7&quot; and 140 pounds, and the MS is a good fit.  The torso on these suits is slightly longer than most other brands, which is good for me.",

It is only 600 fill, so something to take note of.\n\nI&apos;m 5&apos;3&quot;, 130lbs and wear a small. I&apos;m a 27/4 in most pants and a small in most tops.

I love the breathability of the jacket and how it keeps the wind from getting through. I love it&apos;s light weight and length (long enough to keep my butt warm). I love that it is roomy enough for a fleece layer but fitted enough to wear by it&apos;s self. I just wish it had an inside pocket. That&apos;s the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.",

It looks like you are phasing out the Gore-Tex and the waterproof low boot in this model. Not a very good business decision, I don’t think.I am going to have to search a different brand now to get a real waterproof/Gore-Tex low boot.",

Purchased for a European trip where I knew I&apos;d be doing a ton of walking.   These were perfect.   My 55 year old feet and legs never ached or got tired and we walked many miles per day.  Waterproof, so I was fine walking through drizzly Parisian cobblestone streets.   They would be great for heavy duty hiking too.   For lighter duty walking, such as on a path, I would probably pick something slightly lighter weight.",

They are definitely waterproof as I&apos;ve been wearing them whenever it pours or snows. They are a bit heavy for everyday wear, but once a week is good enough for me. I walk several miles a day to and from work by choice, so I prefer lighter weight shoes. These are Moab 3 are great.",

I liked the styling and reviews said the foam material was nice, which is an understatement. They fit perfectly and they&apos;re comfortably snug without being binding. 11/10 footwear. (Buy 1/2 to 1 size under your gym shoe size, as you should always do with sandals, since you won&apos;t be wearing socks!)",

Easy use and rode out a thunderstorm in style. \n\nA few years later, we broke out the tent again and all of the tape on the fly seams had completely delaminated and crumbled! We have several tents by other brands which held up way better than this! We liked the design of the tent but if it won’t keep you dry, the tent is worthless - a lot of money to spend for a single-use tent.\n\nI reached out to support two weeks ago and am still waiting for a reponse…hopefully they can help.",

The costs of the first two solutions were reasonable and we opted for buying a new rainfly. Although the problem with the rainfly was frustrating (my score for the tent is still 2 stars), I feel that the warranty/repair service was efficient and compassionate. The proposed solutions seemed fair to me.",

The powder skirt is meh plus after the fist 20 mins I pretty much unzip everything. Even so, it keeps me dry for the most part. The velcro over wrist is amazing. It is lightly insulated, so it doesn&apos;t exactly keep you warm in cold weather if you&apos;re thinking about using this as going out jacket like for light hiking activities or such BUT for snowboarding it&apos;s great because you don&apos;t get too hot.

Ive had my pair for over 4 years putting untold miles on them doing trail work in Vermont, walking on slippery logs and rocks creeks in the woods for a whole season, and hiking often as well. These boots stick where you put them and keep you there. Excellent ankle and arch support which doesn’t feel constrictive. Breathable and pretty darn water resistant. Oh and they are still going and look like they have years to go. These shoes really help me do my job, I cannot recommend them enough.",

I bought them, didn’t break them in at all, and hiked 30 miles in 3 days without ANY issue. Probably about 40-50 miles in one of the shoe lace holders broke. These boots were used in Michigan, Oregon, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Wisconsin, and all throughout Minnesota. I just got back from a 16 mile hiking trip in two days and I have blisters on my big toe. I had the worst foot and joint (hips and knees) pain I have ever had while hiking. In a little over two years of me having them I put about 130-140 miles on them (based on my Apple Watch tracker which I have found to be more accurate than my hiking partners watches she’s had over the years). With a quick google search many references state a good pair should last you 500-900 miles or 10 miles each week for a year. But none the less these were great boots for the most part. I did at lot of hiking on pretty tough terrain so that definitely can play a role but who knows. I mainly also do all my hiking in spring and fall. All I know is I think it’s time to retire these and try something new after all that pain. All in all they are great for your average hiking person with a narrow foot.",

I have not used them extensively and as of July, the rubber part started to lift. I think it is a design problem.  Otherwise, they are confortable, waterproof, but the sole could be more gripping. I recommend that you extend the rubber part and they would be perfect!\r\nI don&apos;t know if they are still under warranty but if yes, I would like another pair!!!",

The fit was true to size, it was nice because it didn&apos;t have any drawstrings or pockets to get in the way of the hip belt on my pack. I did return it though because it was just too thick and warm for summer hiking. Might be a good option for fall or early spring.",

I&apos;ve worn it all day outdoor rock climbing in the high 80Fs, on a challenging 8mi hike around 80F (pictured below), and just for running errands. The best part is I got this when it was on sale and it was such a steal! I&apos;m usually in between a small and medium and I got a medium in Pumice (oatmeal color).

        "reviewBody": "I purchased this as a gift for my grandson, who put it on as soon as he received it Christmas Day. The very first time he tried to buckle the straps, one buckle completely came off as it was not secured well enough at the metal joint. We had to find tools to completely pry apart the metal, put the strap back together, and then use pliers to compress the metal back together to hold the strap in a loop position so it could be buckled. Not something we should&apos;ve had to do the very first day of use, or at all for that matter. Very disappointed in the quality of an expensive, namebrand product",

It fits my sort of larger head really well (not too tight so my hair isn&apos;t irreparably smashed when I take it off), it&apos;s flattering, the fabric is soft (not at all itchy), warm, breathable and washes well. The colors I have are really pretty and it&apos;s essentially all I could want in a winter hat.",

The downside is that the  traction in snow/ice is pretty horrible which is disappointing for an “all terrain” winter boot with a Vibram sole. I’ve already had a few hard falls in less than a month of wearing these. Save a few bucks and get the original thermal boots, looks like they’d have better traction.",

I thought I could be careful and wash it according to the tag instructions and my experience would be better … WRONG! \n\nI wore this coat ~ 6 times and washed it according to instructions. My coat was so messed up from just the one washing. The down all balled up and made it look like my coat had tumors. It was really gross. Do not buy this coat!! You’ll be sorry! I had to fight to get Backcountry to accept my return. This was a swing and complete miss by OR, don’t waste your money.",

I got in the oyster color which is even better in person than online shots - feels very elevated. Even though this may not be the &quot;most waterproof&quot;, I can confirm it is highly water resistant. It kept me dry and warm during a rainy PNW day, even after a car splashed me w a puddle! The (dirty) water bounced right off leaving no trace behind - which was such a relief considering the color of the coat. All in all this piece exceeded my expectations SO much so that I felt compelled to share with whoever will listen ;-)",

It was the coat that I chose to take on a trip to Europe to wear everyday in a bunch of different weather conditions.

The inside is my favorite as the insole is softer than my husbands Red Wings but is still quality and sturdy, not like other brands that use women for an excuse to cheap out on material. It even has pink laces! I’m surprised this wasn’t like a special edition boot for twice the price.This boot makes me want to visit Red Wing, Minnesota",

It definitely helped but I was not totally happy with the bike. These tires changed my bike into everything I hoped it to be. It’s smooth and fast. I had lost over a half a mile an hour, but now it’s back. They grip well and roll fast. Secure on corners and comfortable to ride on. Using the right tires can certainly change your bike. These tires are exceptional in my opinion and for my needs.",

They feel thick and sticky but they also feel a little slow. Hard to believe my old Mezcals feel faster to me. This could be due to the wheelset as well. That being said, I love Vittoria tires. I don&apos;t ride anything else anymore but I think I&apos;m going to try the regular Terrano Dry&apos;s next time and skip this one with the center slick. \r\n\r\nI&apos;m riding a lot of road and double track fire roads so I went with this as an experiment. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like &apos;em a lot. Just not for the money I spent. I am curious how long they will last.",

Super fast when it needs to be and enough grip in the turns without adding resistance that big knobs do. Raced it on super fast hard pack, deep sand, chunky gravel, slabs of rock, moon dust, and everything in between. \n\nI&apos;ve started running the Vittoria insert and with the lower pressure that allows me they are super comfy. \n\nIf you are not a good bike handler you may need to look at a tire with more tread.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought 4 of these tires.  2 from Competitive Cyclist and 2 from Backcountry.  700x35.  Both times when they were $30 on sale.  The 2 from CC went on friend&apos;s Trek Checkpoint and mounted on Bontrager wheels.  One of the wheels required a bontrager strip but otherwise the tubeless hold and my friend seems to be happy.\n\nThe second set, however, has had some issues.  They mounted just fine on  Stan&apos;s grails with stans tape and tubeless valve.  Once seated, they seemed to seal, however, the rear tire just won&apos;t hold air for more than a day.  Sometime front loses it too, but seems more stable.  The rear will go completely flat within a day or 2.  I have put the tire into bathtub and there are bubbles all along both sidewalls, lots of bubbles.  I have added more sealant and even had tire on it&apos;s side, then on another one, and that held for few rides, then it started losing it again.  So 1 out of 4 tires seems to be defective.  \n\nI don&apos;t like making warranty claims so I may play with different sealant or just tube it and call it good until it&apos;s done.  But for my new set, I will go back to Panaracer which has proven it&apos;s mettle when it comes to tubeless.",

        "reviewBody": "Very challenging to mount. These look great with super nice volume. Roll nicely. Probably a great tire if planning to use on-road only. On gravel, I find the tread to be really lacking. I know this is the &apos;zero&apos; model, so I don&apos;t expect it to perform in heavy gravel, or technical double track, but even on mild gravel roads, the traction is very unpredictable. Had my first gravel slideout/crash in many years when I pushed these tires in a turn. My fault for pushing them too fast through a corner, but my complaint is how fast they lose traction with no hint or warning. Most tires you&apos;ll feel starting to break traction and you have a fraction of a second to react ... not these. It was upright one instant, on the ground the next. \n\nAlso find that they cut extremely easily. Backside of my seat tube is a gooey, sticky mess from the frequent cuts and subsequent sealant spraying. Really disappointed as I wanted to keep these on the bike. Just happy I got them on sale.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these last year and put them on my Scott Scale MTB. My riding is 90% paved trails, 10% hardpack dirt or gravel roads. I run the pressure at about 75 psi letting them get down to maybe 50 before I fill them up again. Last year I rode about 1100 miles and had not flats. This years I&apos;ve had 4 flats all within the last month. As I look closely at the tire tread I can see multiple small slices and several tiny holes. Two of the flats were caused by pokes through the tire from what I guess was wire. Two flats were caused by tiny but very sharp pointed stones.\n\nThe tight bead on these tires made getting them off my rims challenging. Getting them back on was not difficult at all.\n\nI really don&apos;t know if 2000 miles is great, average or so-so but I feel that 2000 miles on a set of tires is pretty darn good despite the flats. Maybe my luck will change with a new set of tires. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve ordered them again. They ride well, are quiet and for my type of riding, a good choice.",

They really fit my feet well, and I&apos;ve been willing to tolerate the la sportiva rubber (not my fav) until it&apos;s time for a resole and I can get something stickier. Unfortunately,  the rubber on the eco is an order of magnitude worse than the old mythos. Even more unfortunately, when I&apos;ve had the shoes re-soled they delaminate in the mid foot between the lining and the sole so that the shoe bubbles up uncomfortably in in your forefoot. This has happened with two different  pairs at two different resolers (both with excellent reputations), and the resolers say that this is a known problem for them. So as much as I love the fit of these shoes I can’t justify tossing them every six months when it is time to resole, especially when the native rubber is so bad.",

        "reviewBody": "Friend indeed!  I am so happy with the Rafiki as a Powder ski. It is poppy and playful with a reliable turn that still allows you to float in a heavenly way through 2 inches of cream or 2 feet of fluff.  The design is buoyant and &quot;surfy&quot; but I still felt stable when landing on a cat track or a groomer- just keeping me on my toes.  Overall if you are looking to add a TRUE powder ski to your quiver this is an &quot;always friends on powder day&quot; addition.",

The packets have zippers, so nothing falls out. It hits me at my thigh, which I like. I?m 5?2?. You won?t be disappointed with this jacket.",

They do run small so I recommend getting a size larger than you normally wear. The only negative is the padding is a bit too wide at the front where it flares out making it a little uncomfortable on the walnuts, other than that they fit and feels great.",

        "reviewBody": "9/20/21. This is just my initial impression, but I think this is a really well made jacket. It&apos;s not nearly as heavy as I thought it would be. The only strange thing is that it is very narrow across the underarms. I measure 41 inches around the chest and based on the size chart I should be in a large. The large is just too tight and pinches when I cross my arms. I&apos;m going to return it and get an XL. Hopefully it isn&apos;t too big everywhere else. \n\n9/24/21. I decided to order an XL and keep the size that fit best. The XL definitely fits best and it fits like most brand&apos;s Large. For example, the Endura XL fits like my North Face Large. For clarity purposes, I am 5&apos;10&quot; tall, 175 lbs, with a 32&quot; waist, and 41&quot; chest. I am fit, but not heavily muscled. I mostly mountain bike and trail run, but I do lift free weights 2x per week. I hope this helps others find the right size. I&apos;m really looking forward to riding this winter in my new jacket.\n\nCheers!",

The large exterior zipper pocket on top of the clam shell easily gets a failed zipper clasp when zipping which can be solved by having the cinch straps on top of the zipper instead of below the zipper. When you go to cinch the two straps down they pull on the zipper itself. Rather than pulling on top and put no pressure on the zipper, it pulls from under the zipper and strains the zipper itself. Design flaw that could have been easily fixed.",

Material has a linen type feel but does not wrinkle and holds its shape much better than linen - more durable.  Also not scratchy on the skin like some cheaper alternatives.  Great for a hot day, almost in replace of a broken in Hawaiian shirt but nice enough to wear out to dinner, etc.\n\nI own it in both the Sand Stone tan and the Green colors.  Periodically check to see if Fjallraven has released a light sky blue, which to me would be the best color… please make one Fjallraven!  I’d buy two ;)",

I wore it for a beach day this past weekend when I wasn’t on the water, am thinking of how I can dress it up for a casual summer wedding next month, and won’t leave on any summer trips/vacations without them. I usually like a slimmer fit, but this is a perfect relaxed fit. I’m not swimming in the material, but it’s also very airy and comfortable, and just fitted enough to look really nice. I can’t thank Fjallraven enough for carrying size xs in men’s!! If I had to pick a gripe with the shirt it’s that it doesn’t have 100% full mobility when completely lifting your arms out and above your head, but I also know that’s not what this shirt is intended for. Terrific product and a fair price for how exceptional it is.",

However, they are lighter than most linen shirts. I’m 6’3” tall and the XXL is perfect for me. I hope they keep this style and add colors. The only problem with linen shirts is they usually come in bright pastels. With good colorways, this shirt can really be a great asset in the summer.

The only complaint I have is that there seems to be something wrong with the dye/fabric. There are spots on the fabric that are turning orange/brown, and every time I take it out of my dresser, another discolored spot seems to appear. At first, I thought it may be something that I was doing during the day to stain the fabric or perhaps something in my washer/detergent that was causing it. However, both of the shirts have been plagued by this issue, not just one of them. Additionally, none of my other clothes are affected by this weird discoloration, so I doubt it has anything to do with the way I do my laundry.",

As a comfortable and cozy boot for a never-ever preschooler it ticks all the boxes. Beware of wet-weather skiing because they can get quite damp inside - they are not super waterproof. However, as our 3-year-old son has progressed, the boot definitely has it’s limitations. The primary issue being that the ratchet loosens significantly while he skis meaning that he begins to lose control and we have to keep stopping to retighten them. This is a little disappointing. Otherwise they have held up okay and meet the basic needs for a good price point.",

These are lighter than regular Charger&apos;s, feel like they have have a slightly stiffer baseplate, and have more supportive asymmetrical hi backs. The ride quality is very responsive while maintaining quality board feel. I ride these on a Spring Break Powder Racer split, which is like a soft flexing short-fat board with a tight sidecut. Having a nice responsive binding on a wide board is a great match. Allows me to get it up on edge with less effort and navigate with precision. Big fan of Bryan Iguchi too so I had to get his signature color haha love em.",

        "reviewBody": "Has proved a capable backpack for day-to-day activities and the moderately strenuous outdoor activities I&apos;ve take it on so far. The large main compartment and solid construction allow me to carry items, the water bottle/side pockets are useful, and the outside pockets can hold more than I expected while still being easily accessible. Fits and distributes the weight well. I really like the rip-style opening of the main pocket for accessibility and security. \r\n\r\nHowever, some of the pack&apos;s features do not seem to meet the intended purpose. The back-facing molle weave between the two exterior pockets is too small for most accessories. I&apos;ve used bungee cords to hold jackets and other foldable items there, but securely attaching anything of that size requires multiple cords, which makes it hard to reach quickly and partially interferes with the other pockets. Similarly, the placement of the molle-exterior upper side side pockets is too low to attach additional pouches without interfering with access to the water bottle pockets. I carry a Nalgene, which impeded the bottom rows of the molle weave on whatever side I&apos;m carrying the bottle. Having any substantially sized or weighted accessory either interferes with access to the bottle, won&apos;t fit, or, if I can only put something on side, throws off the profile and balance of the pack. \r\n\r\nI feel like I&apos;d have to shop for/use products that are too small/niche to justify their place on pack if I want to get any use out of the molle sections. Molle on the flat bottom of the pack, on the lid where the logo and Velcro are, or on the shoulder straps might be more useful. Additionally, the low profile/cut-away style of the molle sections feel less durable or secure the more conventional weave styles I&apos;ve seen. \r\n\r\nOverall, solidly made pack with good storage, but the design and placement of some of its features make it less versatile/modular than it could be or than other &quot;tactical&quot; style packs.",

It&apos;s been my favorite pack by far, and it&apos;s held up to EVERYTHING. I always felt like I needed a bit more room, so it was time to snag the 32.  Mystery Ranch took all of the soul out of this bag. I ride a motorcycle with two large laptops, and I&apos;m honestly worried about things falling out. The mag-buckle system on the two rip pouches NEVER needed to be removed. I kept a charger in one, and a larger power brick int he other. I don&apos;t know if I trust the two rip pouches to not dump my stuff on the highway. It&apos;s just, man... what a bummer. It&apos;s a shell of the bag it was. Boring color options as well. \r\n\r\nThere were some good additions made, but they fall into the &quot;well I should hope so/should&apos;ve been there from the start&quot; category. I think the internal storage is laid out better. The straps and yoke system are definitely better, as are the hip straps. Water bottle pockets are handy. But it&apos;s a lot of features removed, and a lot of &apos;every pack has these&apos; features added. It&apos;s a now a sad, middling bag, and no longer worth the price. \r\n\r\nOff to eBay to find a used previous gen 32. If you love your RipRuck, and you should, this is not the same.",

The fact that they seal even without the zipper closed is great for when you&apos;re going in and out of pockets. The separate laptop pocket is so useful! The only thing I&apos;d fix is the top flap is a little floppy so it doesn&apos;t always catch the magnets.

Only complaints would be that the bottle holders on the side have a hard time holding larger bottles like a standard Nalgene bottle. When you set the back down bottles always want to fall out. Also wish the bigger bag had the same zipper all the way down the front like the smaller one but these struggles are splitting hairs. Over all great versatility and durability.",

The opening was wider than the quad section of shorts.  My wife said they looked liked bellbottom shorts....  I  own several different brands of shorts (Santini, Giordana and Assos) and all of those shorts are smaller diameter around the gripper near one&apos;s knees, basically normal leg shape.  Larger diameter around the quad and smaller diameter above the knees.  \n\nIf this is how they are designed, I cannot recommend.  Very disappointing coming from a high end bike short.",

FC-R are favorite (well constructed, great pad) and Rapha&apos;s are super nice (great fabric, don&apos;t like pad as much as FC-R but still really nice).

At first I thought it was great, as I really wanted it to carry most of my gear and some room for persoanl items during flights especially. BUt the more I use it, the more I realize it&apos;s just poorly designed to fit much of anything. I barely have space for my leses in the bottom compartment, and the lack of thoughtful pockets means I&apos;m always fumbling for little things like batteries, keys, or cards etc. \nAlso, I didn&apos;&apos;t realize how much not having a spot to slip over luggage handles would affect me, but it does greatly. I was choosing between this one at the time and another brand bag that did have this and I regretit literally everytime I fly.\nAdditionally, one of the zipper pulls has broken on the side compartment which is disappointing.

Philosophers have been asking the same question for years, what does it all mean? Well so far, the common denominator is time. Spend it wisely. Buy the right pack, drop the cliff, take the photo, give them a story to tell.",

        "reviewBody": "I absolutely love my Thule Aspect backpack! I have seen tons of different backpacks, but I truly feel I made the best decision with this one. I consistently haul my mirrorless SLR, 3 lenses, filter pack, extra batteries and memory card holder all in the lower part. I am able to use the side access to pull the camera out on the go, and switch lenses if needed. In the upper portion I use the separate pockets to organize my smaller stuff, and have plenty of room for 2 medium packing cubes. I haul my tripod in the right side pocket, my laptop and tablet in the slim full length pocket, and in the outer rear pocket, I have gloves and a few other things. I loaded this thing up and have traveled all over the place, it takes the beatings with ease while protecting my equipment. I hope Thule continues with this design! One suggestion would be to add another pocket to the left side on the side access door, with a strap up top.",

For the price, there is not a better DSLR bag, I am able to take 2 mirrorless cameras, GoPro Hero 7, small light, shotgun mic, a Mavic Pro 2 in the top pouch and a iPad if needed.  The bag is not designed for hard riding or skiing but everything is well protected for some easy rides to get some shots.  The flat bottom allows the bag to stand on its own if needed and the straps are light but durable.  The hip belt is the real gem in this bag, makes it functional for light biking, hiking or skiing and does not get too hot on your back due to the smaller footprint.",

Although the storage compartment on top of the camera storage part is a bit too small, can&apos;t put much stuff but at least it can still hold back Macbook Pro 13 pretty well at the back sleeve. Other than that its a really well made backpack and definitely looking forward to bring it along my other adventures! 9/10",

It looks like regular bag which is really good and sometime it is safer too. \n\nIt has enough space. I have fitting Nikon full frame dslr with 24 70, tamron 70 210, small Tripod and all accessories inside. Also it has good storage space on top. Able to fit laptop and tab and tripod outside. Padding are really good and steady. Bag is not too heavy compare to other Thule models. After keeping everything inside, ya it is heavy : )\n\nAlso padding section can be completely removable so can use like a regular bag. Really good design and impressive materials and quality.\n\nKeep in mind, It don&apos;t have water proof cover like Thule perspertiv. But has laptop area which other models of thule don&apos;t have in dslr bags. \n\nEverything looks good before I found some small flaw in design. See the 2nd picture, the padding on the back feels very sharp inside. May be try to cut the top layer of the back cloth. Not sure what will happen but I am keeping the bag as I like the other features and design. Let&apos;s see if it breaks. I think it is design issue and not just with my bag. Hope it will not have any issue..",

This jacket is the perfect thickness, she love the inside and how soft and fuzzy it is, and there is still room to wear a sweatshirt underneath if absolutely needed. It&apos;s easy for her to zip up as well and the pockets are a decent size. We use to have to fit with layers due to only have a fleece or super puffy winter jacket to pick from, and this jacket as eliminated all of those issues.

This thing is just ok, pretty mediocre in the whole spectrum of jerseys I&apos;ve owned. It has many pockets but compared to other jerseys the 3 main pockets are smaller so the overall storage space isn&apos;t much more. Instead it leaves you fumbling around unzipping all these different pockets to get things out.  The fabric is thick and not very stretchy, so not the most comfortable out there. Quality seems ok, probably will last a long time.",

        "reviewBody": "I wanted to like this pack as it generally sits comfortably and snug and seems great for run commuting, hiking and cycling. The back panel is cushy and the material is super lightweight. \r\nHowever, when hanging a full hydration reservoir inside the designated loop on the inside, the top part of the pack collapses into a fold due to the lack of structure. The fold gets uncomfortable and annoying for the upper back really quickly. Seems like a major design issue to me. Also, all the straps are so stiff that they need two hands to adjust which can get bothersome when running or cycling.",
