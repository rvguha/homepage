Even if it goes to the same places. Loved meeting fellow cider lovers and even if you are not a cider lover, you will enjoy this tour.  The varieties of tastings will make elevate and widen your knowledge of ciders."

I have loved tulips since I was a little girl and this was no difference.\nFrom the hotel pick-up to the 2 tulip farms we went to then a nice visit to a little town called le conner then end the day with some cheese and wine, this is indeed a perfect tour. \n\nWe did the tour last week of April and there were still plenty of tulips out and I mean there's still fields and fields of tulips. \n\nMichael was an amazing tour guide as well. Our group was pretty cool group.\n\nHere are some of my recommendations: please wear rain boots that was you'll enjoy the tour. It was very muddy and Michael made sure to tell us to wear rain boots. I highly recommend purchasing one for your seattle trip especially in April. Bundle up, it will get pretty cold. Highly recommend getting gloves.\n\nAgain, I highly recommend this tour, for the price point you will not regret it. I will definitely be back next year with my mom."

There's two important things that will make you have a wonderful experience. Please take the weather seriously. Wear the appropriate clothing and footwear when going. If it has rained or is raining, there will be a lot of mud to walk through to get a better view of the tulips. The second thing is to make sure to follow the instructions of your guide. Our guide, Michael was so friendly and accommodating throughout the trip. They make sure you have plenty of time for everything, just make sure to get back to your rendezvous spots so the tour can continue on in a timely manner.

Michael does a great job of helping different groups get to know one another during the ride and also has a wealth of knowledge about the Skagit Valley. There was plenty of time at both Tulip Town and Roozengaarde to tour the fields on your own, and again, Michael does a wonderful job of explaining all of the features of each location before giving time to explore on your own. Surprisingly beautiful weather made the lunch stop in La Conner and our wines tasting even better. I was extremely pleased with my experience and have already recommended them to friends visiting the area soon. I definitely plan to tour with Nature Nuts again the next time I am in the Seattle area."

        "reviewBody": "We were denied access to tulips in 2020 thanx to COVID & so as a backup adventure, we traveled to Washington State to see the Skagit Valley Tulips.  We traveled with Nature Nuts Adventure Travel, and it was one of the best choices we could have made.  Michael with Nature Nuts was an excellent communicator and shared intel for the day in advance & set expectations of the adventure.  Michael arrived on time and was very personable and inviting.  We had a drive up I-5, which was expressed that it would be lack luster, to which it was.  First stop was tulip town, which was only accepting prepaid invites & was sold out for the day.  Tulip town was nice, well set up, but seemed rather small.  The tour was a free form which allowed us to venture forth into the fields and have our own experience with tons of photos taken.  After the tulip town, we were off to La Connor for lunch.  The town is small, but inviting & Michael had us there ahead of the rush which afforded us enough time to get some food without pressure to rush rush rush.  While eating, we were lucky enough see a Harbor Seal pop its head up from the channel and say “hello.”  After lunch we were back on the transit and off to Roozengaarde Display Garden; which was massive and amazing!  Want to talk about information overload; the site was laid out with a smaller version of a garden with many (almost too many) tulips and designs.  The fields went on forever with a mountain backdrop that gave us some incredible views and experiences.  After Roozengaarde Display Garden, we were off to Tulip Valley Winery.  A small little stop where fantastic snacks made locally & of course wine & cider.  I tried the cider, and it was enjoyable, but the snacks (for us ) were the hidden gem, meats & cheeses as well as a pepper jam that my wife fell in love with, and we picked up a few jars to share with our friends.  Lastly, we were back on the I-5 and dropped off punctually.  Michael was outstanding & to me; filled any gaps that might be experienced on the tour.  My wife asked me why I booked the tour versus doing it myself.  Watching all the traffic, clusters of people that had no clue where to go what to do & unawareness of the site selling out; made me even more thankful for Michael, his wisdom & knowledge of the area and mad skills of patient driving made it totally worth it!"

Wir waren später mit Dem Guide (Daniel) 7 Personen, eine wirklich nette Truppe.\nWir fuhren zur Fähre, Da gab es dann erstmal Kaffee, Tee oder was das Herz begehrte und ein paar Snacks zum Frühstück. Mit der Fähre rüber nach Bainbridge Island, dann einige Zeit fahren, dann ein kurzer Abstecher in ein Reservat, Daniel hat sehr verständlich und deutlich alles erklärt.\nWeiter zu einem Fluss, Wasserfall, Mega See und dann erstmal Mittagessen. Picknick, Daniel hat gekocht und ein mega Mittagessen gezaubert, das war wirklich super lecker. Dann weiter zu einem Wald mit Wasserfall und dann noch zur längsten Sandbank der Welt. Ein wirklich schönes Abenteuer, mit einem super netten Guide. Daniel wusste sehr gut über die ganze Gegend bescheid, und sehr interessante Geschichten zu allem parat gehabt. Wir fühlten uns sehr gut unterhalten und haben eine Menge dazugelernt. Gegen 18.30 Uhr wurden je nach Wunsch in der City wieder abgesetzt.\nWir können diesen Ausflug nur wärmstens empfehlen, auch für Menschen, die aus der Region stammen und gerne etwas mehr über ihre Umgebung wissen und lernen möchten.\nVielen Dank Daniel"

It helps to have a passionate and informative guide, and we had just that.  Sarah was superb in every aspect.  Beginning by quickly learning everyone's name that was on the tour (9 of us I believe).  She continued to use our names for the entire day, not forgetting any. It helped she grew up in the area, and has a sincere appreciation for what she does.  You could tell the genuine love she has for this area, and the Park.  She had countless stories and examples of cool stuff to see and do, even outside of the tour. It can be difficult to manage a group of people in an orderly way, but she did it less like a heard, and more like a guide.  She faced countless questions from the group, and answered all, meaningfully and respectfully. Even when my youngest wanted all her attention during the tide pool exploring, she managed to be there for everyone.  From the ferry ride, to the hike to the falls, she was 100% there and engaged.  On top of all of that, she was training another individual.  Sarah was amazing in every way, and I cant imagine what the tour would have been without her.  Book this tour, and ask for Sarah."

He took us to mile-high Hurricane Ridge, with stunning views of snow-capped peaks, for a delicious picnic lunch (complete with tablecloth and cloth napkins!) near a rushing river and waterfall, and to Crescent Lake, for an easy 2-mile hike through old growth forest.  Being in a small group (6 of us) and with an excellent driver made for a stress—free way to be introduced to this spectacular place. Daniel timed everything perfectly - we never felt rushed.  We felt privileged to be able to spend a day in the presence of such majestic beauty."

    "description": "Explore pristine alpine meadows, wander through magical old growth forests, and watch roaring glacial waterfalls crash into rugged canyons on this small group day tour to Mount Rainier National Park. The snowcapped peak, encased in over 35 square miles (91 km²) of ice year-round, is endearingly referred to locally as “The Mountain” and is a must-visit Seattle day trip. Throughout the day, you'll enjoy meaningful commentary on the history, culture, and geology of the region from an expert local guide. The tour includes a gourmet lunch, park admission, and pick-up/drop-off at your Seattle hotel in our luxury Mercedes van.",

He is friendly, personable, knowledgeable about the area, prepared, and a good safe driver. \nDaniel picked us up at our hotel at 7:45am. On the drive to Mt Rainer National Park, he told us about our day, the park and asked what our activity level was so he could gear the tour to meet our needs. We stopped on the way for a bathroom break and had delicious pastries he had picked up from a local bakery. He also provided us with coffee, water, soft drinks, snacks throughout the day. \nAt the park we went on several guided short hikes, saw three beautiful waterfalls, Paradise and reflection Lake. We even had a chance to explore the lodge there. We had a wonderful gourmet picnic lunch complete with tablecloth, cloth napkins, real plates and wine. After returning to Seattle around 6pm, Daniel dropped us off at the waterfront so we didn’t have to walk there or get an Uber from our hotel. \nIt was a perfect day and the mountain was visible in all its glory. I highly recommend Daniel with Yonder Sky Tours. He was so great, we did another tour the next day with him to Snoqualmie Falls and Woodinville wineries. Another awesome tour!"

Daniel is from the area and was able to provide insight on everything we stopped to look at. He found a variety of stunning areas to see on our journey up to Paradise. It was very well rounded, and every stop was perfect. Once we reached Paradise, he gave us time to explore on our own. On the journey back down, we had a wonderful gourmet lunch. Then we made a couple more sightseeing stops. The weather didn’t cooperate with us, so we never got a great view of the top of Mt. Rainer. That’s a risk when booking these trips, but the day was still great. The photos really don’t do it justice."

Continental breakfast, gourmet lunch and planned rest stops added to the quality of the tour.

        "reviewBody": "My sister and I booked this tour for our trip to Washington. We liked everything this tour offered in its description--small group, all inclusive and a detailed itinerary with multiple scenic stops. Daniel, who owns and operates Yonder Sky, picked us up at our hotel and we traveled with 5 others (total of 7 passengers) in a comfortable Mercedes van. Our first rest stop was 1 hour away, where he offered us delicious breakfast pastries and a surprisingly broad selection of beverages! We then traveled another hour to Mt. Rainier (all of this time flew by because of the great conversations we were having). Daniel took us to several different spots, including many waterfalls and into the old growth forest with a brief, guided walk. Our stop at Paradise was flexible, we could either follow him and hike to Myrtle Falls and get a closer view of Mt. Rainier, or spend the time however we liked. We ate a picnic-style lunch (chicken, noodle, salad, etc.) at a table in the park, which was great as well. Daniel made sure we were hydrated and really enjoying the trip. After a couple more stops, we headed back towards Seattle and he offered to drop us off at the hotels or wherever else in the area we preferred to continue our trip. This tour was wonderful and definitely one of the highlights during our trip. Daniel was kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Everything felt comfortable, like going on a family trip or trip with friends rather than a tour. If you are thinking of booking a day tour, going with Yonder Sky is the way to go. We could not have imagined a better experience of Mt. Rainier!!\n\nPS- the views were so breathtaking that my photos look almost unreal, but I promise I took them during the tour!"

I didn't even do much research on the trip and I will admit I was blown away by the tour and the area we saw.  I am normally a DIY tour person and I am so glad I booked with Matt and Daniel.  Daniel was our guide for the 6 people in the luxury van and we saw so much more than if I had tried to tour on my own.  We learned a lot about the area, did some light hikes, saw beautiful waterfalls and visited so many great vistas.  Our lunch was wonderful.  It was so nice to have real placemats, silverware, cups and plates wine and super tasty food instead of some kind of sack lunch.  I will be booking with Yonder Sky again next time we are in the area."

The front passenger seat was empty, so we could have easily and comfortably carried six people -- that's the Tour Guide plus five guests.  I think they limit the number of guests to seven.  If so, that will not be comfortable.  Maybe it's seven total people in the vehicle; but even so, three people will have to share a bench seat.  Depending on the size of the people, as well as the mobility and flexibility of the people, that might not be comfortable.  I recommend Matt and Daniel limit the number of guests to five.\n\nThis is Daniel's business, so he is very conscientious.  He confirmed with me in advance; confirmed the pickup time and location.  \n\nAs promised, he had coffee, bottled water and snacks.  He provided us with snacks throughout the day, mostly delicious pastries.\n\nWe had lunch at the Heritage Restaurant in Woodinville.  Lunch was very good; the restaurant was clean, the service good, the price included in the cost of the tour, and the food was delicious and fresh.  BUT I thought that the \"gourmet lunch\" was going to be served at one of the wineries, which wasn't the case.\n\nWe did visit Snoqualish Falls, which was nice.  We also visited three wineries and did wine tasting.  And we stopped at an old train station to use the facilities and stretch our legs.\n\nThe van is new, clean and comfortable.  Daniel was on time.  We were treated well at  each of the wineries.  Daniel chose the three wineries well, starting with Chateau St. Michelle which is a big corporation, then a small winery and then an itty bitty winery.  \n\nIt was a very pleasant day.  We enjoyed the company of Chelsea and Megan, as well as Daniel.  I with them much success in their business venture.  I do recommend this tour."

Then let Matt take you to taste some of the finest wines available in Woodinville, believe me, he knows. I got to taste (and purchase) a world class Cab and Savigion Blanc from 2 wineries I never would have been able to find, much less go in for a tasting. Some of these family owned, boutique wineries are producing the finest wines available anywhere. Door to door service, beautiful waterfall, excellent guide, great lunch followed by incredible wines. There is no better way to spend a day when visiting Seattle. Deserves way more than 5 stars."

Read all the details of everything that's included - it truly is a \"luxury\" tour. Snoqualmie Falls and wine tasting at it's best!  Everything is included in the price including a lovely organic and locally sourced lunch at one of Woodinville's best restaurants (we were able to choose what we wanted off the menu and everything was delicious).  Wine tastings are all included and our guide, Matt, tailored our tasting to the types of wines our group was interested in.  It's a choose your own adventure tour where you have a say in what you'd like to see and do. Matt was also very knowledgable about the lore of the Snoqualmie Falls area and was very well versed in the local wineries and the surrounding agriculture.  Overall the trip was friendly, fun, and just what we were looking for.  Forget those big corporate tours where you'll still end up buying your own lunch or wine tastings - let these guys treat you right and give you everything you need."

Because he grew up there, he was able to provide lots of insight into things we wouldn't have gotten with just 'any' tour guide.  \nOnce we arrived via ferry, the day went by quickly as we strolled through the beautiful gardens and got to see first-hand the Japanese internment memorial.  The lunch was amazing!!  A feast of multiple tasty dishes that are not the standard box lunch you would expect on a tour like this.\nThe wineries he took us to were lovely boutique-type operations with very tasty wines and info from the owner/winemaker at one of the stops. \nDaniel made sure everyone on the trip was well cared for and he explained in detail everything that was planned and what was coming next.  Do yourself a favor and book your tour with Yonder Sky.  You won't be disappointed!"

We were picked up (on time!) from our hotel in a well-kept, spacious vehicle, and were immediately welcomed by Daniel.  The ferry ride provided some great views of the city, and we were provided with hot beverages and pastries for the ride.\nThe hike through the Bloedel Reserve was beautiful, and was done at a pace that suited everyone in our group of 7.\nLunch was served on a beach, and consisted of chicken, salmon, a variety of salads, and fresh baguette - absolutely delicious!!\nThe wineries that we visited had great ambiance, and included with the tour was tastings at each.\nOverall experience was fantastic and Daniel was very knowledgeable  - I would highly recommend this tour."

We decided to book the Bainbridge Wine and History Tour with Yonder Sky and we are so glad we did.  Daniel, who grew up on Bainbridge Island, picked us up at our hotel sharply at 9:00am in his Mercedes van.  He had pastries, coffee, drinks and snacks for the ferry ride over to Bainbridge.  He was an excellent host and tour guide.  He took us for a drive to the shore on our way to Bloedel Reserve.  We toured the incredible grounds and estate home.  If you are an outdoors and nature lover you need to see this place.  The trail walk through the beautiful woods and gardens was about 2 miles in length.  We walked at our own leisurely pace and took lots of pictures.  Our next stop was lunch at a local cafe housed within the beautiful Bainbridge Island Museum of Art.  We spent some time in the museum itself before going to see the Japanese American Exclusion Memorial.  It was a stark reminder of darker days in American history.  Daniel was really able to make the visit to the Memorial more personal as he went to grade school and high school with grandchildren and great grandchildren of some of the Bainbridge Japanese American residents who were sent to internment camps during WWII.  Following the memorial we did some wine tastings at a few local wineries.  Eagle Harbor winery was an exceptional treat.  At our request and in lieu of the third wine tasting stop, we spent some time walking in downtown Bainbridge.  We stopped in the local grocery store and Daniel picked up some smoked salmon dip to go with crackers as a snack for our ferry ride back to Seattle.  We had a wonderful day on this tour and Daniel was a terrific tour guide.  We would highly recommend using Yonder Sky if you’re planning a visit to Bainbridge Island.

He was fully prepared with pastries, coffee, tea, water etc.. to make our trip as pleasant as possible. \n\nDaniel was happy to answer any questions we had about the island history, inhabitants past and present. The tour was carefully planned to enhance our day. We had time to reflect on  historical events that included information on local Indian tribes that once inhabited these islands and most recent in some of the lifetimes of family perhaps grandparents of the 20th century who were around during WWII. The Japanese  Memorial on the island  is a good reminder and reflection of islanders affected. A must see.\n\nDaniel took us to have a wonderful lunch in town and we were able to talk and get to know each other after which was followed by a great walk in the Bloedel Reserve which was truly amazing to see.\n\nThe local wineries were amazing. This tour was carefully choreographed to truly share  what Yonder Sky is all about. \n\nShowing us the natural, historical, and beauty of the land  and its people.\n\nThank you to both Daniel and Matt for your hospitality and I can't wait to return to do the rest of your tours.\n\nBest day ever.

This small group gives you the chance to interact with your fellow travelers and guide.  The new Mercedes van is modern, spacious, clean and comfortable.\n\nOur guide, Daniel, was very knowledgeable and courteous.  He made sure that we got to see the beautiful coastal scenery, interesting sights and provided many photo opportunities. Daniel enthusiastically shared his knowledge of the history of the area, including much about the Native Americans who settled in this area and about the founding of some of Washington’s oldest communities.  \n\nThe walk through the woods to the beach at Deception Pass allowed us to get up close to Old Growth Douglas Firs and Western Red Cedars.\n\nWe were treated to a nice lunch at a local restaurant in Coupeville, one of the oldest communities in Washington.\n\nAfter lunch we visited several other interesting and scenic sights including Fort Casey, a World War II military installation, built to protect Puget Sound.\n\nOn our return journey to Seattle we took the Clinton Ferry to Mukilteo.  Nice to experience the Washington State ferry system as it is such an integral part of life in this area for work and play. \n\nThank you Daniel for such a memorable day and being a weather wizard that was able to change a very rainy forecast miraculously into a nice day."

He was very professional and had all the accommodations one could ask for, and he even accommodated our nut allergy, as well.  In addition, he was very informative and interesting.  The luxury van was a very comfortable and nice ride.  We had a lovely lunch in an adorable village and we really enjoyed the overall itinerary and stops, as well.  I would highly recommend this tour and I look forward to trying their other tours on our future visits out to the West Coast."

We stopped at multiple places (even one where they served coconut cream pie, Dahlia's Bakery {I think}) and my wife and kids loved it. Along with the pie, we had cupcakes, brownies, cookies, cheesecake, liquid chocolate, and Obama's favorite: Fran's Chocolates. It was darn near overwhelming. Our tour left at 11am and we obviously skipped lunch that day, but walked it off later around the Market and taking a tour on the Seattle City Pass (Space Needle, MoPop Museum, etc...). Well worth the price. I say do it, you'll adore it...and ask for Marley. She was a great tour guide."

The tour was only 15% food tasting and was more focused on history, running way over schedule. While our guide was extremely informative and nice. Some stops weren't even food-related, which could have been skipped to keep the tour on time. The tour included 7 food tastings and 2 drink tastings, but I felt teased at some places we learned about the food without getting to taste it. Notably, 2 of the food tastings were available for free outside of the tour. Overall, I left the tour hungry and underwhelmed for the price.\n\nSuggest renaming the tour to \"Pike Place History with Tastings Tour\"?"

The guide said he had sent a confirmation email with the current address, but I never got it. Luckily, the staff at that restaurant, told us that we were at the wrong location, and called the tour operators, to verify the new location (this restaurant had previously been included in the tour). If we had not checked in with the staff at that restaurant, we would have missed the tour and not received a refund. Anyway, back to the food and the tour. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and the tastings were delicious. Some better than others. My friend had her slice of pizza soaked with water when the guide accidentally knocked over the water on the pizza. I get it, things happen, and it was an accident, but at least order more pizza. The overall food quality was a 4 out of 5. The volume of food was a 2 out of 5. The tour guide's knowledge and friendliness was a 4 out of 5. We were still hungry after the tour, and then went to dinner. Almost missing the tour was a 0 out of 5, but thankfully we were helped back to the correct address. We have both done other food tours in other cities, almost a dozen between us. This would be a better value at about 65.00 per person, considering the small amounts of food."

        "reviewBody": "I want to start off by saying our tour guide was amazing and I do appreciate her kind and fun energy. I've been on several food tours and enjoy cooking very much myself. For the price of this tour and the title including the word gourmet I was expecting a lot more to expand my palate in a place such as Seattle. Unfortunately I don't feel like I got that from this tour. Normally on food tours we try very different things that do flow together in some kind of way. On this particular tour we had salmon in two different dishes, truffle oil in two different dishes, and not much of a variety for anything else in my opinion. I did come hungry and I also left hungry. I understand that five stops means the plates will be smaller but it was done in such a way that I just left disappointed and so did all my friends. If I had to rename this tour I would call it bites of Seattle and leave gourmet out of it. I also would put in the description that it would focus on possibly seafood instead of just a food tour in general as we had that in three of five dishes. Lastly I was confused on how they went about deciding the drinks to go along with the dishes. We went to a place that focuses on over a thousand spirits yet we were served a local pilsner. At one other place we were served a cocktail, but the base was a pilsner. So again not much of a variety in the drinks either. The information the tour guide gave us was very interesting but it's sad if you want what she talked about way more than anything you were served. Until they do a better job with this tour I would recommend to my friends coming to Seattle to try different tours like the coffee tour or the underground tour instead of wasting their money on this one. I come from a smaller town on the East coast and they put on way more of an amazing food tour (for a fraction of the price still featuring unique and gourmet food) whether you are a foodie or just someone looking to try something new."

Matt was a hoot from the start, he was very informative as well as fun and a really great speaker. Unlike tours ive been on he was very personal not just with me but the other members of the group. I enjoyed the other tourists, some were local, some visiting just like me. Each location we got to taste both a small dish and a drink that paired well with the dish. I didn't realize until the end of the tour how far we had actually walked. During the walks Matt would give us fun facts about locations we were passing and suggestions on additional locations that were not necessarily part of the tour and I loved that! We also got a discount card at the end of the tour as well as a $25 giftcard to one of the restaurants that would last up to 3 months. I used the giftcard at Heartwood Provisions as I had been wanting to go there anyways. Overall a fantastic tour, I would even go on it again."

The individual with the beard then yells out to everyone while he's boxing up $600.00 of over priced fish, \"THIS IS A FISH MARKET, NOT AN AQUARIUM.\"  All of the tourists took the hint and walked away disappointed and disgusted not getting to see what once used to be.  Seattle in general has gone to hell over recent years with homeless,  drug abusing, urine smelling, graffiti filled streets.  This will be my last visit to the area."

Bob seems to know everybody at the market and he is so friendly and helpful. He’s very good at talking up the vendors on our tour since he knows so much about them.  Bob must be this company’s MVP tour guide or something. \nIf I were to compare our tour to other Seattle food tours, I would say this one seemed to focus way more on the vendors than on the market as a whole. At times I felt it was like an ad for the tour vendors, which I understand is a difficult thing to balance since you need to nurture your partnership with them. There is so much rich history that was covered in this tour, but there was also a lot more that could have been covered if there was less time spent on promoting the vendors. I like learning about the vendors’ histories and products, but I don’t want to be sold to either. Learning about them already makes us want to support them by buying something. \nSuggestions for improvement:\n1. It would be great if we had wireless earpieces to hear what Bob was saying. With all the ambient noise at the market, it was often difficult to make out what he was saying from the back of the group. Other tours have these and it’s a life saver. \n2. Maybe show more parts of the market, take us through some of the lower levels if possible, maybe mention how the “original” Starbucks isn’t really the original one, or explain how the busker program works at the market with the designated performance spots."

Make you sure tip him at the end for his troubles, he earns it. \n\nEven at 13 degrees, it wasn’t  too cool in the harbour on the top deck with a coat on and the views are great. Bring your binoculars if you want to see the sea lions though!"

Boarding went well; announcer/tour guide was good; and ship has lots of options for those that want to be outside and inside.  Downside was that you could hardly hear the tour guide when inside.  On a cold/windy day highly recommend good dress if you want to be outside--it can get breezy and cold.  The tour could be 1-1/2 hours (but this is not really a downside, must something I think would fit)."

Choose to depart Elliott Bay/Pier 54 or South Lake Union/AGC Marina. \n\nEnjoy a narrated cruise over Lake Union, Ballard Locks, Puget Sound & Elliott Bay. Lake Union is home to the famous floating home community seen in the classic Sleepless in Seattle. The lake is an active airport for seaplanes, water sports & the fishing industry. You'll pass many commercial docks (home to vessels from the show Deadliest Catch). On your way from the freshwater of Lake Union to the saltwater of the Puget Sound, you pass through the Ballard Locks which holds the saltwater out of the lakes. In Puget Sound, enjoy astonishing vistas of Seattle's unique skyline, Mt. Rainier and ferry boats plying the waters. \n\nAfter the Locks Tour, board a coach shuttle back. Transfer only/No narration. ",

He was a wealth of knowledge, interesting stories and history and possibly the most enthusiastic resident and Ambassador for Seattle.  The captain was very good as well and they worked as a great team.  I think her name was Amy.  \nThe only downside was that the ship takes you to the Riverfront park, then puts you on a bus to take you back to Lake Union.  Our bus was a hop on hop off bus and the air conditioning wasn't working and it was VERY hot.  We decided to get off and take an Uber back to our place instead.  The experience was so good on the boat that it offset the return trip so there is no reason to downgrade the rating."

We were lucky and didn’t have to wait so we moved through pretty quickly.  From the boat  you’ll see the floating houses, including the one from Sleepless in Seattle, lighthouses, islands, giant cruise ships, dolphins, and a great view of the Seattle skyline. \n\nThe boat is clean and spacious with a good variety of food and beverage offerings.  There’s an option to take the bus back to Lake Union, in our case a fun double decker bus.\n\nOur passengers included young children, elderly grandparents and everyone in between.  So appropriate for all ages. \n\nI highly recommend this tour"

Our tour guide was very good, but the group was so large that sometimes we could not hear what he had to say. \nOnce the tour started inside the plant we were advised we were not allowed to take any pictures.\nThe plant is immense but we went on a Saturday so many of the workers were off.\nAt the end of plant tour they drop you off at the gift shop for souvenirs.\nOur driver took us back to our hotels and along the way gave us informative information about Seattle."

When we arrived at the factory we had time to look around the shops and other exhibits prior to our booked tour time. Our guide was an ex airline pilot so hid knowledge and experience showed in his presentation, we were taken by bus to the factory where a lot of the areas of manufacture of aircraft was explained to us. After our tour of the factory more time was available to browse the shops or go to the observation deck to watch planes take off and see the aircraft that were ready for trials. Altogether a great tour."

        "reviewBody": "I went on this day tour to Mt Rainier and our tour guide was Cory. The tour looks to be subbed out to a company called Customized Tours. Overall, this is a good tour and I recommend it. I am stretched for time on this particular trip to the USA, so this day trip worked well for me on this occasion, but I think if I was going to visit Mt Rainier again, I'd rent a car and go it alone, simply so as to have flexibility to do things at my own pace. However, this tour does pack plenty into the day and is about right in terms of value for money. \n\nThe only negative is that just after I was picked up and before we'd even got going, our guide said that he could be tipped via various mechanisms, and there was even a sign at the front of the bus saying tips are expected for good service and so-on. I've been visiting the USA my whole life, and in the last few years there's been an unsightly move to tips being expected, not appreciated as a bonus, and the entitlement is not warranted. I always tip for extra special service - and did tip Cory - but if the customer chooses not to, that's a customer choice, they should not be made to feel they must or are somehow out of line. So the tour drops a star for this, although in fairness, it should be just a half star dropped as it's not the end of the world, but it's not possible to do this. \n\nThe tour itself is superb and I really enjoyed it. Cory was a great guide and made sure we had adequate stops in and out of Mt Rainier. At the location itself, he was incredibly clear on timings, where to meet, where things are, dos and don'ts, also talked about the history of the site. You can of course read all that there, but having an engaging guide like Cory really brings this to life, so is part of the value-add of doing a tour like this. \n\nI would say this tour is better suited to someone like me, a casual tourist on a tight timescale, I think if you want a proper hiking tour then you'll need something different, this is really a high-level view of the main points about Mt Rainier, which is fine for me as I am disabled and can't walk too far anyway, but any serious hikers might feel frustrated. \n\nMt Rainier is spectacular in winter, truly a beautiful place to wander enjoying the peace and the sights. I recommend water repellant walking boots in winter, as the snow can be deep (I feel in up to my thighs) and no one wants soggy feet al day long!\n\nSo, 5/5 for the guide and tour, but the overt tipping mentions are not needed, people will tip for good service, as I did. But it's not just these guys, in my last few trips to the USA, since around 2022, there's been an unsightly focus on expecting and extracting tips and my new policy is if someone asks for one, then on principle I won't give one!"

However, I wouldnt consider this a tour - more transportation.   the group was dropped at Mt Rainier lodge, given snowshoes (for those who wanted),  told to download a trail app and meet back at the van 2 hours later.  Considering I was solo on this trip this limited my exploration.   I was uneasy about going off on my own (turned around a couple times on the trail knowing that if something happened or I got lost I would be in a bind).    \nAlthough the driver did mention some facts of the area driving up to the mountain he didnt explain the itinerary until he was ready to (usually right before dropping us off at a stop).   At least an hour of the day was spent at two stores for riders to get snacks/coffee.   There were some other things that were off putting but I will not list here since overall I don’t recommend. \nI previously used another tour company in Seattle and although a little more money, the experience was top notch (plan discussed, tour guide on all hikes and lunch provided).  Will use the other company the next time I’m in Seattle."

Our tour started with a hotel pickup and then to Kroger. Our tour guide, Lucas (?) let us stop there to grab any last minute items we may need. I suggest wearing warm layers. I had fleece lined yoga pants along with thick socks, 2 layers of shirts, water-proof hiking boots and gloves. \n\nI would also suggest brining snacks and a lunch wi the you if you don’t plan on buying anything at the grocery store. There is a Starbucks there if you’re not a morning person and want to grab coffee. \n\nOur drive up to the mountain was not bad at all. Lucas talked to us the whole way up, giving us amazing fun facts and funny stories about his time as a tour guide. You will stop at a clearing by a tiny church to get your first clear view of Rainier. There is a photo opportunity here as well! \n\nThe best part of the hike was the waterfall and Paradise Lakes! If you have the option to choose between Paradise Lakes and another stop PLEASE choose the lakes. The view of the mountain is absolutely glorious. I cried. UGLY tears. I’ve never experienced something so beautiful in my life. \n\nMore tips: \n• Bring a GOOD portable charger. You’re going to take lots of pictures and videos!\n• Bring snacks or buy them at the Kroger or little store you stop at on the way back to Seattle"

    "description": "On our loop tour east of Seattle you will see incredible views and taste wines at small family owned, estate-boutique wineries for an intimate tasting experience. You will have the opportunity to sample wines at two wine establishments occasionally including Goose Ridge and the famous Chateau Ste. Michelle winery or Woodinville Whiskey Company (if Chateau is closed). This sightseeing excursion will lead you deep into the rolling Cascade foothills, past lush horse ranches and flower farms, through scenic single lane rural roads leading you up to one of the top visited natural attractions within the state of Washington, 268 foot Snoqualmie Falls underneath towering Mount Si. Should time allow you may also receive a BONUS stop for a sweet treat! ",

Michelle was larger with an open air building concept,  Goose Neck Estate was comfortable, warm, and cozy. Goose Neck was our favorite of the two. Chris at Goose Neck was very knowledgeable and down to earth.\nOur tour guide, Mark, was prompt, pleasant, knowledgeable, and comical.\nWould recommend, but be mindful of “fees” and additional costs of impromptu purchases."

The first was personable although expected to be at an actual winery.  The second is a huge establishment and not so personable.  Thought there would be a third visit to a winery.  Our driver asked if we would be interested in going to a family-owned chocolate factory.  All said yes.  Thought this might be in addition to a 3rd wine stop.  It was the last stop of the day.  The falls were lovely.  Overall, disappointed."

Will definitely be drinking more of their wine.  Had some shipped home.  And the cider was awesome too - lavender!  The water fall was beautiful.  Lunch at the other winery was very good - had the flat bread and wine flight.  Of course the chocolate shop was yummy. I highly recommend this tour.  Our driver, Cory, was outstanding.  He gave us lots of fun and insightful information  along the way."
