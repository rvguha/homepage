      "reviewBody": "The movie is very good...if you&apos;re into this kind of thing. It&apos;s nice to see a franchise splatter film that is intense and gory without being cheesy. Many of the current crop of splatter films are played intentionally cheesy for humor. Which is fine, but they shouldn&apos;t ALL be like that. This movie has some humor in it, but it&apos;s a darker humor, and not meant to be cheesy or campy.\n\nEverything that comes to mind when you hear the words &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; is in this movie. No wussing-out in this one! Murder, torture, cannibalism, insanity and a touch of the surreal. Oh yeah, and a chainsaw. No punches are pulled, so this flick is not for the squeamish.\n\nTonally it wasn&apos;t as surreal as the original, but it had a better (read: creepier) tone than the 2003 remake. Plenty of blood and guts. R. Lee Ermey plays a major character instead of a bit-player like in the 2003 remake, and the film benefits from this.",

      "name": "Brigitte Bardot explodes",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Et Dieu... crea la femme&quot; is Brigitte Bardot&apos;s breakout film. She explodes on the screen, overwhelming the audience (the male audience by sure). I bet that women, as well, are shocked by the thought that such a rival-bomb can exist. \n\nThe movie itself have always been underrated. It was a scandal at the epoch and we can easily see why. Actually, the erotic atmosphere created by BB in &quot;Et Dieu... crea la femme&quot; is amazing even for today standards (immensely superior to that of current movies, in my personal opinion). At any rate, the scandal made the movie be automatically considered bad (needless to say, people went crazy to see it). Curiously enough, a dozen of years later several ugly movies were automatically considered good by the critics because of the scandal they raised! \n\nNow that our modern eyes no longer see the scandal, we may judge &quot;Et Dieu... crea la femme&quot; a nice film, made VERY special by Brigitte Bardot&apos;s presence. The stunning locations of a still tourism-free Cote d&apos;Azur are beautifully photographed. The story is interesting and entertaining. Melodrama is systematically avoided. The script contains a good deal of typical French wit: sharp, cynical, but with a melancholic subtext. A couple of instances. The mature gentleman Eric Carradine, trying to justify Juliete&apos;s bad behavior &quot;I am the only one to be guilty of that&quot; and the old woman &quot;Don&apos;t delude yourself, sir...&quot;. Again Carradine &quot;I fell in love with a young girl and I gave money for her to marry another man. How do you call it?&quot; and a friend &quot;I call it wisdom&quot;.\n\nBardot brilliantly plays Juliete, a remarkably interesting character. Probably, more than her free and mindless attitude toward love affairs, Juliete&apos;s true personality may be described as anarchist selfishness. She doesn&apos;t give a damn for others. She just does everything she wants, not caring people&apos;s opinions, prejudices or feelings. She loves animals, though. A further point of interest is that, according to her own autobiography, BB&apos;s personality has some in common with that of Juliete&apos;s. I don&apos;t comment Brigitte&apos;s sex-appeal. Words are not enough, just look at her and enjoy. The life at the village on the sea and the various other characters are described with accuracy. Jurgens, Trintignant and the remainder of the cast work well.\n\nThe cult-scene of the movie is Juliete&apos;s Mambo dance. Here we understand what Europeans of the 1950s thought to be a torrid scene. We also see that they were right!\n\nSeeing the movie, many are displeased that (seemingly) a dose of heavy slaps turns the wild Juliete into a devoted spouse. That looks machist ideology. Well, to begin with, to beat guilty women is just a realistic and predictable behavior in the low class environment of a village of fishermen in the 1950s. But, above all, do you think Juliete-Brigitte tamed by few hits? Come on! She accepts the slaps only because in that very moment she has thought it good to take them. But who knows the future? Believe me, Juliete is far from being tamed, and the end of the film by no means coincides with the end of the story... \n\nIn spite of possible criticism, I like &quot;Et Dieu... crea la femme&quot;. Right or wrong, this film has a relevant place in the history of cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "The Whistleblower (2010) is a movie based on the sad but true story of human trafficking by the employees of a firm contracted by the UN to provide security in Bosnia after the Dayton peace accord that put an end to the bloody conflict in the Balkans. Rachel Weisz plays Kathryn Bolkovac, a cop from Nebraska, who arrives in Bosnia to work for this firm and is seconded to the gender-affairs department. Weisz sees the stint as a much needed change of scene leaving behind a broken marriage, plus as an opportunity to improve her financial position given the compensation that comes with such a hardship-posting.\n\nThe times are tough and the residues of communal hatred still linger - one situation shows the apathy of the local policemen towards a victim of domestic-abuse given that she is from the &quot;other side&quot;. Weisz stumbles upon a racket of human trafficking that lures young girls into slavery who are abused by ruthless sadists -- all with the active connivance and involvement of some employees of the firm. Wiesz lone voice is silenced by the firm -- despite the support she receives from a plucky UN officer for gender-affairs, played by Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nEventually, Rachel takes the sordid story, of protectors who have turned predators, to the media in the UK, where the firm is registered.\n\nFighting workplace conspiracy that is fueled by apathy and greed can be lonesome and Wiesz portrayal of a gritty professional is engrossing. One is reminded of the roles of Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich (2000) and Laura Dern in Damaged Care (TV 2002), standing up for what is right despite being stymied by the perpetrators whose acts have the undertones of gender-bias, and suffering the indignation while staying the course with deep conviction.\n\nThe movie is spartan in production-value, driving home the truth that a good script and great performances are more than enough to tell a story.\n\nThe story makes one wonder of the risks that arise out of the involvement of private enterprises in security and policing, notwithstanding the mandates under which they operate."

      "reviewBody": "After watching the Terence Rattigan DVD collection (with most of the adaptations being from the 70s and 80s) when staying with family friends last year, Rattigan very quickly became one of my favourite playwrights and he still is. His dialogue is so intelligent, witty and meaty, his characterisation so dynamic, complex and real and the storytelling so beautifully constructed.\n\n&apos;French Without Tears&apos; (Rattigan&apos;s first successful play) is not my favourite of Rattigan&apos;s plays, or one of them. Do prefer &apos;The Winslow Boy&apos;, &apos;Separate Tables&apos; and particularly &apos;The Browning Version&apos; myself. Despite the story being flimsier than those three, and it doesn&apos;t lend itself as well to more cinematic film adaptations, faring much better to me with a live audience, the light as soufflé and mostly quite sophisticated comedy and the meat of the writing and characterisation still remains.\n\nWhile not one of the best film adaptations of Terence Rattigan about, this &apos;French Without Tears&apos; is a highly enjoyable and criminally underseen version of the play. Is the story fluffy and on the flimsy side? Sure, but it is also one of the more accessible stories of Rattigan&apos;s work subject matter-wise. Is it old fashioned? In a way, though modern audiences probably would get into it easily knowing what to expect. Does &apos;French Without Tears&apos; work better on stage with a live audience? To me it does. Does that mean that it doesn&apos;t work at all as a film? Of course not, but other Rattigan plays fare better on cinematic terms, judging from director Anthony Asquith&apos;s later Rattigan film adaptations &apos;The Browning Version&apos; and &apos;The Winslow Boy&apos; (both even better) for example.\n\nThis film of &apos;French Without Tears&apos; looks lovely, with suitably intimate and beautifully composed photography and sumptuous costumes and sets. The star in this regard is David Lean&apos;s (yes that David Lean, before he went on to even greater things) editing, especially in the carnival scene. The music is energetic and is pleasantly orchestrated.\n\nFurthermore, the script does capture the play&apos;s wit and zest, not all but for stage-to-film translations enough of it does do, Rattigan&apos;s gift for light humour, writing that provokes thought and a darkly painful side, which brings complexity and dimension to the subject matter, and his attention to meaty characterisation still shines, even if the story still feels flimsy, the humour sparkling and as light as a souflee and other parts are very sophisticated.\n\nCharm, heart and zest is all over &apos;French Without Tears&apos;, which flies by and while it is a very short film (just over an hour) one wishes a little when it&apos;s over that there was more. The highlight is the drunk scene which is hilarious. Asquith does a great job directing, very assured while understanding the intimacy of the relationship between dialogue, camera and acting.\n\nOf the splendid cast, Ray Milland and Roland Culver, both on very natural, sparkling form, are the standouts. Ellen Drew is very charming, one can totally see what the characters see in her.\n\nIn summation, hugely enjoyable and should be made available on DVD. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

(What was that on the packaging? Clip art?) When I&apos;m in the mood for explosions and helicopters, it&apos;s a disappointment to bring home a movie that instead has as its big moments someone breaking down a door or fingerprinting someone.\n\nThis movie is a rambling, disjointed drama. It wasn&apos;t completely awful, but was like real life in that the story doesn&apos;t completely make sense and doesn&apos;t work artistically. (And if they&apos;d shown one more Casablanca-esquire foggy airfield, I&apos;d have screamed.) It&apos;s just a bunch of confusing stuff that happens, and then other stuff happens, and who cares about any of those people? And we spent the first 45 minutes trying to tell the various dark-haired women apart. Or maybe they were all the same woman. Still don&apos;t know.",

And I watch a lot of movies. This one provoked tears many times, it&apos;s overwhelming on so easy, non-pretentious way. \n\nLet&apos;s back to the subject. The story is very true, complex, convincing. Acting brilliant. Although the movie is a bit slow, it attracts like a magnet, so you can not keep an eye out of it. There are maybe some strange coincidences, but they do not spoil anything. Sunspense and thriller is present all the time.\n\nIt raises many questions: &quot;What would I do if I were him&quot;, &quot;What is the limit of my love to my child&quot;... Great psychological dilemma, makes you think all the time. It is true European movie, with some American influence, but only on a good way. If you like, at least for a moment, to escape from Hollywood crap, I recommend this movie 100%.",

I wasn&apos;t expecting much of it, as most things on that last at night are usually things that are too boring to be on earlier. However, I was very surprised by it, I actually enjoyed it. It&apos;s a story about the friendship between Darly and Marianne, who met at a bus-stop after Marianne ran away from her abusive husband. Darly is going to Alaska and decided to take Marianne along with her, sort of like a daughter figure. Marianne always likes to look on the bright side of things which leads her into bad situations. Darly is assertive but good-natured, she means well. And because she was so witty it made the film much more enjoyable. The first half of the movie is a road-movie, Which consist of the troubles they face of trying to get to their destination, and when they get there, they want to leave, at least Darly does. It&apos;s a light-hearted drama and all ends well. Worth a watch.",

What a horrible shock, in public, on one&apos;s &apos;night of glory&apos;!\n\nHe had a highish voice, but one that was extremely expressive - a fine instrument.  The dubbed voice is very low and flat.  I can&apos;t tell you how I&apos;d love to see the film with his voice restored!\n\nMaking movies, like any creativity, is full of compromises, some of them beyond one&apos;s control.  &quot;Todd&quot; still loved the movie - it was filmed in southern Italy - he had a great time doing it.  He was always a very, very handsome and strong man, and his physical presence shines through still.\n\nIt is really a memorable, powerful film!  After seeing it I dreamt my favorite kitten had been slaughtered by the other kittens in the litter, who had become sword-wielding skeleton kittens!\n\nI hope you all enjoy it and don&apos;t get too worked up about inaccuracies with the original story (as someone here has).\n\nBecause its overall professionalism and the magnificent special effects, this movie will live on despite being technologically outdated.\n\nCan anybody speak to the possibility of finding the original actor&apos;s voice track?  What&apos;s to be done?  Thanks!"

On the other side, the cynical part of the character was something to laugh about, with the possibility to get in more or less deep thoughts. I say, nobody has to choose between living in reality and escaping to a dreamworld - stay in both of them, but always respect the borders...\n\nIt&apos;s no fault to watch this movie!

Sure, it&apos;s cheaply produced - it consists primarily of reused segments previously aired or published by the Walt Disney company - but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not still a good time.\n\nProduction value of the new segments is on par with the TV standard of the time and the shorts interspersed throughout fit in relatively well with the rest of the material. Everything&apos;s been restored and remastered to the current standard.\n\nGiven the aspect ratios of the original shorts, however, I believe VHS is the best way to view this special. It&apos;s not cropped for the widescreen television format (although the shorts hold the integrity of their original aspect ratios as well, for the most part).\n\nIf you&apos;re expecting a top-tier Disney production, you&apos;re not going to find it here. However, if you&apos;re just looking to have a good time with the family, this is a really solid compilation of some of Disney&apos;s spookier history.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s almost impossible to believe that this film is from the self same Kevin Smith who wrote and directed Clerks. Gone is the biting wit and odd charm of that film, and in its place, big-budget pointlessness and a dozen more dick jokes. The many cameo appearances of characters from the other movies which comprise the extended &apos;New Jersey Trilogy&apos; (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and the woeful Dogma) serve only to remind the viewer just how good - or even average - Smith used to be. Indeed, whatever it was that made his work so individual and enjoyable was clearly lost some time ago.\n\nDirectorially, the &apos;post-modern&apos; elements (several actors playing dual roles) are fairly well-handled, though presumably quite confusing for those who haven&apos;t seen earlier entries in the series. Unfortunately, however, Smith&apos;s usual lack of visual awareness and style is once more in evidence. In Clerks it didn&apos;t matter: the script was so tight that the primitive direction was irrelevant, but here, with hardly any gags hitting the mark (special mention for Mark Hamill&apos;s spectacularly unfunny cameo) it&apos;s extremely noticeable.\n\nThe acting too, is of a poor standard with too many lines and jokes fluffed, though Jason Mewes&apos; usual one-note performance (essentially playing a toned-down version of himself, by all accounts) works well here. All in all, more puerile and less funny than its predecessors, though foul-mouthed children, stoners and idiots may take to it more than most."

I know the feature film GANDHI was filmed in India and it is an Indian story, and it&apos;s producers used English as language medium. They had option to film in Hindi, but they used English as a result entire world and particularly United States enjoyed it and GANDHI is well known to American audience now. Offcourse the hero of Bandido is not Silvester Stallone and need not to be. Movie story is not about a body builder but a genuine portray of the character. And Carlos Gallarado is perfect in look and acting. I would like to take him to Bollywood India where more feature films are produced than in Hollywood. Perhaps Carlos will be better appreciated in India and all those countries enjoy Bollywood movies. We can use his talent. I am a member of Producers Guild of America and I know it is a hard work to produce an Independent movie without any studio help or help from Hollywood movie tycoons. Among all supporting actors very few spoke English as first language, yet they portrayed better character and many of them never acted in any movie before. Like Salma Hayek, they will take over Hollywood soon. Just watch out. My Salute to Producera/Director/Writers and all actors. MobinKhan",

      "reviewBody": "Stephen King calls this the best film based on his works.  It is easy to see what he likes about it.\n\nFrank Darabont directed this short film at the age of 24.  At about 30 minutes in length, it tells the story of a man who is watching his mother slowly die in great pain.  He must make the decision of whether to allow her suffering to continue or to help release her from her pain forever.\n\nThe story was a tough one for King to write, and was loosly based on his own mother&apos;s death.  The acting by Michael Cornelison is fairly good and the performance by Dee Croxton, who relies on simple facial movement, is also done well.\n\nDon&apos;t watch the film if you are looking for King horror, for there is none (except one nightmare sequence).  Darabont, in his directing debut, shows why he became such a force in the film world.  His style here is very good, and forshadows his extraordinary King adaptions, The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\n\nAn interesting side note, is that Croxton later appears in The Green Mile. Brian Libby, who plays a prisoner in Woman, also reappears in both Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile.\n\nIf you are a fan of King&apos;s short stories or a film scholar who wants to see how a short film can be done right, check this out.",

      "reviewBody": "Boris Karloff was an unusual actor in that as he aged, he didn&apos;t slow down making films even though he was a physical mess. He had advanced emphysema and could barely walk due to a crippling back injury and arthritis....but he kept plugging away...mostly in very cheap international productions. But here&apos;s the weirdest part of it. He knew he was dying and deliberately filmed parts of MANY films...Mexican and Spanish...with the assumption that the filmmakers would later make the rest of the movie after Karloff&apos;s death! I can only guess that he either wanted to leave some money to his family or perhaps he simply couldn&apos;t stand NOT acting! As a result, a couple years AFTER Karloff had assumed room temperature, his films continued to appear in theaters. I cannot think of another actor who did this....and it&apos;s a bit creepy. &quot;The Incredible Invasion&quot; (aka &quot;Alien Terror&quot;) is one of these posthumous productions....and it&apos;s the last one to appear in theaters.\n\n&quot;The Incredible Invasion&quot; is available in two forms....with Karloff dubbed into Spanish or the rest of the cast into English. I was only able to find the Spanish language version. My Spanish isn&apos;t great by any stretch, but I decided to watch this in order to see just how able Karloff was to make movies at this point life...as well as whether or not the film was any good.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Professor Mayer creates a weird ray beam that he shoots into space. Aliens aboard a UFO see it and realize that humans are too stupid to have such power, so they dispatch an alien to inhabit the bodies of folks to make them kill. Why they just don&apos;t kill Mayer and destroy his ray, I have no idea.\n\nSo is it any good? Well, it&apos;s not as bad as a few of these later films, such as &quot;Cauldron of Blood&quot; or &quot;The Snake People&quot;...though this is hardly a glowing endorsement!! The acting is occasionally bad but the sets and special effects could have been a lot worse! You also see only a little of Karloff because he was too ill to film more...so they had to film around him and piece it all together later! Sadly, in one scene they obviously had someone don a welding helmet-like hat to hide his face because he was unable to walk about the room. This is reminiscent of a dentist holding a cape over his face in &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; in order to pretend to be Bela Lugosi...who had died before being able to film much of the story. Overall, a sad and silly film...one that does NOT beg to be seen today.\n\n Most of Karloff&apos;s late career films are either exceptional (&quot;Targets&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerers&quot;, &quot;The Crimson Cult&quot;) or godawful messes (pretty much every other 1968-1971 film).

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been a long wait, but finally, for the first time since 2007 Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once again as the unstoppably funny duo. Their pairing this time isn&apos;t quite at the same quality of comedy as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead but let&apos;s face it, those two movies are comedy gold. Paul is still hilarious and it is rife with highly quotable jokes that you can laugh about for days. Plus it has plenty of great nerdy sci-fi humor that only us true geeks and catch on to. Paul follows two British tourists in America, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) who are traveling cross-country to visit all of the most famous UFO sightings in America. While in Area 51 they pick up a hitchhiking alien named Paul who is excellently voiced by Seth Rogen. Graeme and Clive quickly learn that agreeing to protect this extraterrestrial is giving them a lot more than they bargained for as they are chased by the FBI, hillbillies, and a religious shotgun toting nut job.\n\nIf there&apos;s one thing I can commend Paul on, it&apos;s finally giving us the satisfaction of an R rated sci-fi comedy. The blend of the two genres is great and making it a vulgar, violent riot is just what fans needed with so many lame PG-13 comedies floating around these days. Pegg and Frost wrote a hilarious script for this movie, one that easily could have been ruined by a few edits to suit a PG-13 rating. But thankfully they got to keep it their way and give us something obscenely entertaining.\n\nPaul isn&apos;t one of those profound comedies that breaks the barriers of typical comedy or goes unforgettably above and beyond, but it is really funny. The jokes are hilarious almost every time. It&apos;s not high brow comedy by any means and there are a number of fart jokes, gay jokes, poop jokes, and so on and so forth, but I can&apos;t say that they didn&apos;t make me laugh because I most certainly did. But as an added bonus the film is filled to the brim with sci-fi film references. They range from blatant, like a set of fireworks that make the Close Encounters of the Third Kind tone, to as subtle as the band in the bar playing the Mos Eisley cantina song from Star Wars. This has got to be one of the nerdiest scripts ever written, and I absolutely loved it. I&apos;m sure there are a number of references I missed or didn&apos;t get, but that&apos;s just because every little thing is a reference to some sort of sci-fi film or theme. To quote the Brits, &quot;It&apos;s brilliant!&quot; There&apos;s no two ways about it, Paul is cast perfectly. Pegg and Frost are obviously excellent and you couldn&apos;t find a better duo of British nerds anywhere. Seth Rogen does a surprisingly good job voicing the alien, whose animations are also excellent and add a lot of comedy to the film. Other supporting characters are great in their roles, like Kristen Wiig playing the neurotic ex-Christian Ruth Buggs. Jason Bateman plays a straight man role as the FBI agent leading the chase after Paul and he is hilarious in his own deadpan way. Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio play two other FBI agents who make a hilarious little side pair of characters who have their own running jokes and quirks. Then there are tons of cameos from very recognizable actors such and Jeffrey Tambor, Janey Lynch, David Koechner, and even Sigourney Weaver. There&apos;s hardly an actor in this film that I don&apos;t go, &quot;Hey! I recognize that guy&quot; when I seem him or her.\n\nPaul by no means transcends the comedy genre but it is no doubt funny. If you don&apos;t find at least some of the humor in this film amusing then there is something wrong with you. Sure it&apos;s cheesy at moments, OK it can be predictable at times, but as a comedy it really works and it gave me a solid hour and forty minutes of great entertainment. If you love a good R rated comedy, go see this movie, and if you&apos;re a sci-fi nerd you have to see this movie just for the fun of catching references. This is a great little comedy that is plenty of fun to watch.",

Unless you can&apos;t handle what&apos;s in store in TOP DOG, please don&apos;t pick this one up! The combination of violent action with family-based material is an outrageous atrocity one will not want to believe. It suffers miserably on originality and plot, making this your cookie-cutter actioner. Mommy won&apos;t approve this flick to Johnny and Sally, even if it is rated PG-13!",

It&apos;s the old family farm and essay that son Brett Halsey wrote about life on same that forms the basis of the plot of Ma And Pa Kettle At Home.\n\nHalsey&apos;s essay has put him in line for a two year college scholarship. He&apos;s tied with neighbor Alice Kelley whose father Irving Bacon has a top of the line farm in the county. He&apos;s also a miserly man whose small change still has buffaloes on the nickels and who spends more on his livestock than the family.\n\nA pair of judges from New York from the magazine who ran the essays will decide who gets the scholarships. Ross Elliott gets into the country spirit, but Alan Mowbray is the most nervous sickly man ever created on the big screen or small until Adrian Monk. Living at the Kettle farm with the now 13 kids drives him to distraction.\n\nThe climax is an old fashioned country Christmas with the Kettles and the only thing that makes me curious is why Universal didn&apos;t hold this one up in release until the holiday season. It was released in March of 1954. In the end while Irving Bacon runs an efficient farm, Ma and Pa Kettle know how to run a happy home.\n\nOne of the best the Kettle series.",

      "reviewBody": "As explained in a scrolling text prologue, Crossworlds is set in a universe where there are multiple dimensions and travel across dimensions is made possible by a &quot;key&quot; of sorts that unlocks doors between them. The key is powerful, so obviously there are various parties vying for it. As the film proper begins, we see a man head into a cave to retrieve some ancient relic, only to be confronted by sinister looking men. Then we head back to &quot;contemporary&quot; California to meet Joseph Talbot (Josh Charles), your average film world young, partying college student. Soon Joseph encounters Laura (Andrea Roth) who introduces him to dimension-hopping. It seems Joseph has some role to play in the war for the key.\n\nMuch has been said about the resemblance between Crossworlds and The Matrix (1999). Although some of the similarities are surely coincidences, many may not be. I suspect there will be no end to discovering source material that was somewhat cribbed by the Wachowski Brothers in the three Matrix films. I know that the more pre-1999 genre films I watch, the more I find material that the Wachowskis unofficially &quot;adapted&quot; for their work.\n\nOn the other hand, similarities between Crossworlds and the first Matrix film underscore a point that I like to make about film criticism--I do not agree that originality is a criterion that should be factored into one&apos;s rating of a film. That&apos;s not to say that I&apos;m advocating plagiarism--far from it. But being strongly influenced by other material, or even &quot;riffing&quot; off of it is not a problem in my opinion. For one, the works we claim are original may turn out to be not so original after all. It&apos;s an epistemic problem. Critics are not omniscient, so any work deemed original may turn out, upon future knowledge, to be just as strongly influenced from material we just didn&apos;t happen to know about. So what we&apos;re really doing if we award points for originality is saying, &quot;I&apos;m not familiar with any material that this film is influenced from, therefore it is better than a film where I am familiar with precursor material&quot;. I believe The Matrix is a much better film than Crossworlds. The similar material is handled much better by the Wachowskis.\n\nThat&apos;s not to say that Crossworlds is bad. It&apos;s just average. It has an equal amount of good points and bad points. The principle problem I had with the film was the same problem I had with Constantine (2005)--there is obviously a dense mythology in the writers&apos; minds that forms the basis of the plot, but the audience isn&apos;t told enough of the mythology for the film to achieve greatness. You are never quite sure of the &quot;rules&quot; of the Crossworlds universe. As soon as you begin to get your bearings and figure it all out, some new character appears, some new kind of unusual device, action or ability occurs, and we&apos;re in the dark again, trying to update our scorecards so that the new material is coherent with the previous material. It saps any potential suspense out of the film. It&apos;s a difficult problem for any author who wishes to create alternate worlds, with alternate operational rules. One has to find a balance between too much exposition/explication and not enough. Scripters Raman and Krishna Rao (who also directed) err on the side of not enough.\n\nThere are other problems, many of which seem to be related to editing and specifically the fact that Rao probably had to cut a much longer film down to 90 minutes. That may also be part of the reason that needed exposition/explication is missing. Rao might have figured that if he has to lose material, it&apos;s best not to lose more action-heavy scenes. Changes in setting, plot and/or character attitude are occasionally too abrupt. For example, Joseph expresses frustration at the dimension-hopping predicament (right after they leave the beach) when it seems that he&apos;s barely experienced any of it. This should have been saved for a later scene, and perhaps in the original cut, it did come much further into the film.\n\nBut the film also has many assets, not the least of which is Rutger Hauer as A.T. Hauer is like a slightly older version of Lou Diamond Phillips, which means that he&apos;s something of a grade B and C genre film king. You know that if Hauer or Phillips is in a film, there&apos;s a good chance that it&apos;s going to be at least a bit cheesy. For those of us who have a special place in our hearts for cheesy B and C genre films, we also tend to love Hauer and Phillips.\n\nThe rest of the cast is a treat, too. Charles is terrific at playing a lost nerd, Jack Black gets to do the schtick that made him famous, Roth is appropriately sly, sexy and a bit mischievous and Stuart Wilson as the villain should have most viewers hating him by the end of the film, which is what he&apos;s supposed to do.\n\nAnd of course the underlying idea is an intriguing one. Visually, Rao does a fantastic job of creating an attractive sci-fi film dealing with multiple worlds on a relatively low budget. Many directors would be afraid even to attempt such a feat, as the budget did not allow for much in the way of special effects. Most locations are our mundane Earth, yet Rao is able to convey an epic adventure through multiple worlds with devices as simple as a red filter and locations as simple as a warehouse or black sound stage.\n\nCrossworlds is definitely worth a view if you&apos;re a big fan of this genre. Just be prepared to cut the film some slack in terms of exposition, and keep a scorecard if you have to.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve seen Jet Li beat people down hard with kung-fu in ROMEO MUST DIE, UNLEASHED, CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE and KISS OF THE DRAGON, then you need to check out THE MASTER, a fist-flying kung-fu gem that features loads of realistic fight sequences that unfolds the extraordinary Wu Shu specialties of a then-unknown Jet Li.\n\nTsui Hark, the visionary director who helmed two Jean-Claude Van Damme-headlined vehicles, DOUBLE TEAM and KNOCK OFF, presented this story about a young Chinese martial artist (Li) from Hong Kong who travels to the United States in hopes of finding his master, Uncle Tak (played by Yuen Wah, the Landlord in KUNG FU HUSTLE). When arriving there, he learns that Tak was badly beaten in a fight by a former student named Johnny (Light Welterweight World Kickboxing Champion, Jerry Trimble), who is responsible for terrorizing martial art dojos across Downtown L.A. While Tak recovers from his injuries, Li tries to settle his differences with him while preparing for an all-out kung fu brawl against Johnny and his group of students in order to regain his master&apos;s honor.\n\nShot on location in L.A., THE MASTER was sort of how RUMBLE IN THE BRONX was with Jackie Chan where a Chinese kung-fu expert travels to a crime ridden area in America to achieve a simple goal while encountering thugs and impressing people with his combat methods. He teaches a Police Force healing secrets as if he was instructing a Tae Bo class, teaches a Latino gang kung fu to help them beat off thugs and faces off against an American martial artist to save his master and other hostages held by Johnny&apos;s students. The film&apos;s simple plot allowed plenty of space for non-stop martial art fights.\n\nOne of the film&apos;s greatest achievements was the nicely choreographed fight scenes, courtesy of co-star Yuen Wah who incorporated traditional kung fu and weaponry. The absence of fancy wirework and computer-generated effects allowed the fights to be believable and realistic as possible. Yuen Wah revealed his incredible kung fu specialties against a group of fighters on a building rooftop. He uses close-range takedowns, Wu Shu-oriented butterfly kicks, acrobatics, and other fight moves to show audiences that he is a true master of the art. Jerry Trimble exchanges blows with Jet Li on more than one occasion but the one-on-one finale features Trimble using Tae Kwon Do to execute his cinematic footwork while dealing with Li&apos;s counter attacks, fast-flowing jabs, and Wu Shu Kung Fu. In addition to that, fight, Li gets his leg stuck in a circular pipe handle but is still able to pull off kung fu.\n\nLi helps his newly-befriended Latino gangster buddies fight off Johnny&apos;s posse (two of them who were played by stuntman and martial artist Steven Ho- Liu Kang&apos;s brother in MORTAL KOMBAT and Ju Jitsu expert Stefanos Militsakakis- BEST OF THE BEST 2, MAXIMUM RISK, DAREDEVIL) before facing off against Johnny on top of a car.\n\nYuen Wah is famous for his recent role as the Landlord in KUNG FU HUSTLE and remembered by fans as the man one who caught the apple in ENTER THE DRAGON and doubled for Bruce Lee in some of the sequences. He also had a small role in Chinese CONNECTION (aka FIST OF FURY) as the Japanese who taunts Lee by telling him to walk like a dog. He was a regular in old-school kung fu flicks produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers (recently saluted by Quentin Tarrantino in KILL BILL VOL. 1&apos;s opening).\n\nWorld Karate Champion and Tae Bo exercise founder Billy Blanks made a quick-second cameo as a gang thug but unfortunately, he did not do any fighting which was a disappointment. The reason why the filmmakers did not let him fight will be a mystery but with his martial arts skill (shown in countless B-grade Hollywood movies), he should have fought someone but instead, he is depicted as an unknown extra.\n\nOriginally filmed in 1989, THE MASTER would not earn the 5-time National Wushu Champion his crown to superstardom. The film was delayed until 1992 because Li and Tsui Hark were unaware of what was to come that year when they collaborated again to make ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, which was a box-office success and Li&apos;s ticket to superstardom (in Asia).\n\nTo help capitalize on Li&apos;s fame in America, the generally unknown film, THE MASTER finally got an international DVD release in 2002 by Miramax Films to give viewers the chance to witness the stunning talents of this kung fu master.\n\nOverall, THE MASTER was a bad movie with good fight scenes. It suffered form poor acting and bad antics but it still deserves a full view because it was one of a few modern kung-fu movies to feature lightning-fast, raw and street-effective kung fu to make it comparable to fight-films like ONG-BAK and THE PROTECTOR.",

      "reviewBody": "With credit to the creators of this live action edition of Blood: The Last Vampire, they really didn&apos;t have much to work with to begin with and before I pick apart the movie I feel obligated to preface with this. As an owner of the original Anime and a fan of the Blood series in itself, I was looking forward to a nice tie-in with the saga of Saya the Femme Vampire Slayer. What I got in this movie was a nice collection of katana action, low-budget CGI and poor acting. This isn&apos;t to say that BTLV is a bad movie, just one that I would only recommend to fans of the series itself.\n\nWhat the movie tries to do with the aforementioned anime, is take that exact same story and expand it a bit to give us some history on Saya. We are shown her human father, vampire mother and even a childhood love interest. Our Saya is given emotion (she even cries a bit) and worst than that, she is given a sidekick in Alice McKee (Allison Miller). Though I found Saya (Gianna Jun) to be a very good casting choice, which coupled with the choppy but interesting action scenes, made her seem similar to the anime Saya, I found Alice to be absolutely unbearable. The character Alice is the American element to the movie, being a rebellious teenager stealing daddy&apos;s car, talking back and doing all the annoying things that teenagers in movies tend to do.\n\nThe jerky camera angles, made some of the early fighting scenes very confusing. However it does get better as the movie progresses and some of the battles are quite interesting once the camera settles down. The acting was not bad as a whole aside from Alice whose crying and screaming were so fake I found myself shaking my head every time she had a burst of &quot;emotion&quot;. The direction was good enough and we get a back story as it progresses unlike the original anime. Still when it ended I was a bit confused about Saya even with the history given and it made me wonder why they didn&apos;t stick with more of the elements from the anime series.\n\nIf it were only up to actress Gianna Jun and her portrayal of the killer Vampire Saya, I would rank this with high points but the weight of the bad acting by the supporting cast, the already silly story, awful CGI and the unnecessary military portion of the movie drug it down way below that. Although I would watch it again, this would probably be due to my being a fan of the character moreso than a movie watcher.\n\nFull review: www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",

If you do not think of the movie with that title, but more of sexual exploitation .. mixed with giallo elements. If you are a fan of giallo, maybe you will rate this a bit higher too.\n\nIt starts off - well it makes no secret what this is. Including a forced sexual encounter our main character has to endure. Or does she enjoy it anyway? I would beg to differ in that instance, but the movie does not really seem to care. Depending on your moral stance and if you are able to watch for the movies sake (after all it is a movie and not reality), you may be able to forget ... well how cliche some portrayals are. And I am putting it mildly I know - it is because naming things make them bad for review purposes. Or rather people get offended.\n\nWell if you are easily offended this movie is not for you - nudity, blood and madness ... and all not really well done. Dialog and script and acting go hand in hand ... towards the abyss ... not in a good way.",

      "reviewBody": "They Were Expendable is John Ford&apos;s first Hollywood feature since his discharge from the U.S. Navy and the same can be said for Robert Montgomery. Both had served in the Navy and Montgomery in fact on P.T. Boats. From the last presidential election we now know them as Swift Boats. \n\nIt&apos;s an unusual John Ford film because the usual heavy comedic monkeyshines are rather subdued here. I&apos;m thinking that John Ford wisely decided that World War II being recently over, the country&apos;s mood was joyous, but somber in terms of the heavy human cost.\n\nThey Were Expendable has the benefit though of the American audience knowing the ultimate victory. The story begins in the Phillipines in 1941 with Robert Montgomery as real life naval hero John Bulkeley, renamed Brickley for the film, trying to convince the brass of the usefulness of the P.T. Boat in combat, not just for scouting and courier duty. Of course that experiment is cut short and the P.T. Boats and their crews are rushed into some on the job experience.\n\nDuring the film MacArthur, you might recall Gregory Peck saying that he was going to be evacuated from Corregidor by &quot;one of Johnny Bulkeley&apos;s torpedo boats.&quot; That scene is dramatized as a wordless Robert Barrat plays MacArthur traveling on the boat commanded by John Wayne.\n\nWayne is Montgomery&apos;s second in command of the P.T. boat squadron who is not thrilled to be there. He&apos;d like to be on at least a destroyer. He gradually comes around though. He also gets a fling in the romance department with Navy nurse Donna Reed.\n\nDuring that interlude John Ford had some of the crew outside singing Dear Old Girl in a comic vein. Ford was never one to not let a good bit of business die with one film. You might remember in Fort Apache and Rio Grande there was some serenading done. And Donna Reed got serenaded on her &quot;Hawaiian&quot; honeymoon with James Stewart in It&apos;s a Wonderful Life with Ward Bond once again being one of the serenaders. I&apos;m sure Frank Capra would have conceded he stole that from Ford.\n\nThe story is first and foremost about some very desperate American armed forces who after Pearl Harbor were at the Japanese mercy. Pearl Harbor had totalled our Pacific fleet and no supplies could get through. Still the troops there fought on bravely, they were in fact by geography expendable. \n\nWayne and Montgomery give good but subdued performances. No do or die heroics here, just a sobering reminder of a terrible beginning for the Americans in the Pacific theater of World War II.",

In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the &apos;cinema du look&apos;, Kieslowski&apos;s Red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by. You sense Red is really an allegory, a reenactment of Prospero&apos;s omnipresent gestures in The Tempest, yet it is more than its story appears. Red demands countless viewings, and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.\n\nAlthough Red stands alone as a masterwork from Kieslowski, it&apos;s best viewed as part of the trilogy. Elements of Blue and White are referenced in Red, which knowing viewers will enjoy.",

This is a movie about real life, about human relationships. Its purpose is not entertainment, but reflexion. This is when a movie is considered art.\n\n\n\n* Quebecers are not French. I&apos;m speaking for myself but my ancestor came here in Quebec in the 17th century from France. We do speak french, though (more than 7 million of us). Are Americans British? \n\n\n\n* The Chinese &quot;woman&quot; named before the movie is Arcand&apos;s adopted daughter.\n\n\n\n* Yes the health care is that bad here. But then again where is it perfect? The population is growing old, hospitals are overcrowded, our government spends most of our tax money for it and its still not enough. But at least we don&apos;t have to pay for health care. I&apos;m happy to pay taxes that help elders and sick people get treated.\n\n\nI didn&apos;t think this is a masterpiece, but it&apos;s the kind of movie that stays in your mind for a couple of days and makes you think about where we were 40 years ago, where we are now and where we are going in the future. This is certainly one of Arcand&apos;s best movies with Jesus of Montreal and Le declin... He is an actor director and it shows. He deserved that Oscar if not for this movie for one of those 3 movies.",

      "reviewBody": "from the first scene The Loved Ones is able to achieve what bigger budgeted films cannot - clearly defined and appealing characters that you want to see more of. \n\nthe film splits 3 ways - the very serious family drama of the widow and tortured girlfriend - the comic/horror torture porn - and the comic high school formal/prom date. Sean Byrne shows off that he can do it all and succeeds hopping between these styles\n\nthe horror thread of this film is what it will marketed on. there is blood, LOTS OF BLOOD but very little gore. disappointingly, much of the violence takes place out of shot or has been cut. it is the weakest part of the film due to some over-acting by Princess whenever she goes &apos;crazy&apos;. still, it&apos;s horrific and compensates by being damn funny\n\nso, SCREW IT! this film is fun to watch! \n\nexcellent performances, good soundtrack and smooth production. i saw it at the Sydney Film Festival last night and i was very impressed. my apologies to Jessica McNamee. during a Q&amp;A i referred to her as &quot;thingy who played the goth chick&apos;&quot;. she is awesome! her work with Richard Wilson is freakin&apos; brilliant. the disastrous prom date, though loosely connected to the rest of the film, is my favourite part of it\n\nnot knowing where this film is going to lead you is half the fun. low-budget non-US films try harder and take risks. The Loved Ones does it all. Perfect date movie. See it!",

His life and success track are scrambled, however, with the introduction to Madison Bell (Christensen), a vixen who becomes smitten with him.  Madison seduces Ben in the pool one night, and while he feels guilty after a session of horizontal watersports, Masison goes Glen Close in Fatal Attraction crazy when he turns her down, and the movie starts to turn.\n\nFrom the previews, Swimfan looked like a bad movie, an &quot;Attraction&quot; set in high school suburbia with Michael Douglas&apos; role as a swim fanatic instead of a businessman.  While the last third of the picture veers off heavily into the land of the un-yielding female revenge cliche, the first two-thirds of the film are actually a pretty provocative, tight character study with issues of infidelity and confidence.  Christensen, who made a startling breakout role as a judge&apos;s intoxicated daughter in 2000&apos;s Traffic, plays it rather straight and sensual, which gives the film a boost, until her over-the-top climax, and shows that, in a B-movie sort of showcase, she can hold her own.

      "reviewBody": "Fallen is a movie based on a book by Lauren Kate. It should be the first movie in the series but since there were a lot of distribution problems, I doubt this will become a franchise. The book could have been better, but it was decent. Flawed, but decent. This is just kinda lame.\n\nI like how it tried to keep the moody and Gothic atmosphere, but it all just felt amateurish and low budget, I couldn&apos;t take it very seriously. The first two thirds are a bit slow paced and then the last third feels so rushed, you don&apos;t really get to know anything. You just get a lot of exposition, things just happen but nothing interesting, so the climax just comes off as forced. The one plus of the movie is Lola Kirke as the geeky best friend Penn. She seems to be the only one who actually got into this and tried to make something good. She stole every scene she was in. She&apos;s the most memorable character of the movie and she&apos;s not even one of the leads. The lead actress is pretty much Kristen Stewart in Twilight. There&apos;s really not much difference. The rest of the characters, they are just there. Even that is hard to believe because you just don&apos;t notice them.\n\nThis was the opportunity to improve the story, but it just made the whole thing worse. I&apos;m not even sure if fans will like this.",

The first time was, I think, on Grampa Munster&apos;s (Al Lewis) Saturday morning B-movie show on TBS (which is a broadcast station for the Atlanta area).  The second time was on another Saturday on our then Fox affiliate, WATL.  Like any traumatic experience that defines one&apos;s life from then on, I have a great love-hate relationship with this movie.  The second time I saw it was like looking through a photo album from an extremely romantic and cherished relationship...albeit with the eating of human beings, a teddy bear with an oscillating head, snakes, frogs, abuse of the handicapped elderly, childhood cruelty, jealousy, and lust.  This movie really is quite effective.  The composition of the shots works well, the movie is technically competent, the acting...is creepy.  As mentioned previously, Sandy is almost just as unsettling a presence as Sammy. Personally, a couple of my favorite characters are the cartoonishly prim librarian (check out those glasses) and her butt-ugly daughter who laughs hysterically at Jamie.  Oh yea, who can forget the beginning scene with the Halloween party and Jamie getting punched in the face and being laughed at. This film has a...rawness too it that&apos;s hard to put into words.  It&apos;s more disturbing than most movies with twice the dialogue, twice the names and twice the violence.  You must see it."

Of course, there is always some single person we are meant for ... though endless lovers are expected. Somehow there is a soul mate and we always find that person not matter the pain caused to ourself or others.\n\nDirector Catherine Breillat uses the transition of France from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth as the setting for this tale of &quot;love&quot; among the French upper crust. A cheap plot device - the ultimate detailed confession - provides the full guts of the story, both background and foreshadow.\n\nWhat made the film inaccessible for me were both lead actors, especially Asia Argento as Vellini (the last mistress). I just didn&apos;t find these people likable, whether together or apart. On the other hand, I did enjoy Michael Lonsdale as de Prony, and his wonderful dialogue and delivery.\n\nMostly an uneventful couple of hours with no surprise ending at all.",

She is feeling nostalgic and determines to track down each name on the card to see how they are doing in life. Who knows, maybe a love will rekindle?\n\nThe film is a series of set pieces as Marie sets about her mission and each name on the card is given a short section. This made the film tolerable to watch as beforehand I was thinking to myself &quot;Oh my goodness, this film is almost 2 and a half hours long!&quot; Well, it doesn&apos;t seem like it and that is a credit to the director and the actors and actresses involved. In fact, the film is constantly entertaining even if it does focus on some downbeat situations. You can definitely relate to these people. My favourite story is the one that concerns the priest as it shows how life can move on from sadness in a positive way. I do have 1 question, though - what is that ending about!!? Is that a blossoming romance!!?\n\nIn real life, sentimental reflections just make me sad so I don&apos;t see the point but this film is worth a watch even if the topic is somewhat asking for trouble. I googled a friend when I was reminiscing of past times and found out that he had become a Hollywood stuntman and had jumped from a plane but his parachute failed to open. Miraculously, he survived as some tree branches broke his fall. He broke every bone in his body and his memory has been affected. I wish I hadn&apos;t looked him up! This film is a bit like that but more fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Liar Liar is one solution to the problem of what kind of movie vehicle to write for overacting, rubber man Jim Carrey. Following the success of Ace Ventura, director Tom Shaydac casts Carrey as a divorced lawyer who has no time for his young son. In the film, the word liar is a pun on lawyer, equating the two words since his character is a lying lawyer. Every time he promises to attend one of his son&apos;s school events or play with him, Carrey finds some excuse to get out of it. His son makes a birthday wish that just for one day his dad would tell the truth and it happens. Carrey is incapable of lying and when he tries to lie, his face and body go into every contortion imaginable as he tries to suppress the truth. There is a literally &quot;off the wall&quot; scene where he beats himself up in a bathroom. Carrey is a likable guy and carries the movie. Of course, you can&apos;t believe for a second that he&apos;s a lawyer but belief is not needed in this film. This is a movie with a message that fathers shouldn&apos;t ignore their children. For a film aimed at kids, there is a surprising amount of boob and sexual humor. Maura Tierney is very cute as his ex-wife. Amanda Donohoe plays Carrey&apos;s seductress law partner and Jennifer Tilly is a buxom, bimbo client. Director Tom Shadyac later worked with Carrey in Bruce Almighty. Liar Liar is for Jim Carrey fans and fathers who ignore their kids."

      "reviewBody": "Just when one would expect &apos;Redbelt&apos; to following a predictable path we are thrown off with a twist. Mamet tells a very layered story and most of the twists make sense. There are a few plot holes and perhaps the film could have used some energy boost. The pacing is arguably a tad slow in the beginning but as the events progress the viewer gets more and more drawn in. Mamet also brilliantly involves jiu-jitsu in the main story (unlike other martial arts film where the art is used merely as a device). The film is about honour (as the principles of Jiu Jitsu goes) and sacrifice but &apos;Redbelt&apos; refuses to tread the clichéd path where the protagonist forcefully preaches the message to the viewer. The fights are well choreographed. The cinematography could have been better during the fight sequences. Mamet&apos;s cast is terrific. Chiwetel Ejiofor is exceptional as the noble and dignified Mike Terry. Terry ain&apos;t the clichéd hero. He is deeply passionate about jiu-jitsu but who won&apos;t resort to anger or bloodshed to achieve his means. He is willing to help anyone and he will do it through correct measures rather than the quick but &apos;wrong&apos; way. Max Martini and Alice Braga are good. Emily Mortimer is fabulous. Tim Allen stands out in a small role. &apos;Redbelt&apos; tells the story of a real(istic) hero who is not willing to give up his integrity or sacrifice his honour at any cost, who truly respects his passion and understands it."

He thought he could keep his budget in black by producing soft core adult movies under the name Surrender Cinema- with one edit for home video, a more PG edit for video stores and an R edit for late night cable. The PG edits have all gone out of print that most reviewers are griping about. The movies have an annoying at times identical stamp of nude scenes with only music for sound and usually one glimpse of any genitals or pubic hair. Veronica 2030 in its least edited version has some promise in spite of its one-rule-fits-all format. Julia Ann is gorgeous as always, making the most of her excitement and expression in every scene of undress. Gary Graver&apos;s direction is in his usual style of cutting to the best parts of these scenes and grabbing us with wild new positions of union. The soundtrack is always right on target, giving this and other Surrender movies a minor classic quality. I must admit the only drawback is silly dialogue that makes me run to my forward button almost every time.",

Being a great admirer of The Bicycle Thief, I found this movie hilarious, especially during the parts  Nichetti was watching his film go out of control. Parodies are slowly becoming a dead art form, especially considering Scary Movie seems to be the best one can offer even though it relies heavily on low brow  humor. If you can find this particular film, rent it.",

The way it is blank, but clearly fits to the contours of her face... it completely destroys her identity, makes it like she does not even exist as a person. I would not go so far as to say she looks worse with it on than off, but it makes her less than human for sure.\n\nWhile some of the story is a bit slow, it is overall a quite strong story... part horror, part drama and part detective story. I am not surprised that many horror historians consider it among the greatest films ever made in the genre.",

Yet: the acting is very bad, appart from Bardem, which made it somehow to fit a character that is miles away ( even physically) of what he seems to be in real life. Some dialogues were changed from the book just for the sake of change, I guess, losing their beauty and meaning. Make up is bad - appart from, again, Bardem&apos;s, not to say that the casting in itself is pretty uninspired - appart from those in Florentino and Transito. All in all you can say it&apos;s Bardem&apos;s movie on a great Shakira music.  But that&apos;s not the spirit of the book.",

Last line:What&apos;s peace?\n\nBoy:mom,is there a storm brewing? Mom:no more storm over Vietnam;only the sound of planes .\n\nDad&apos;s gone to fight against imperialism and mom stays at home with her two children;soon,she dies of cancer and asks her boy to care care of his little sister.\n\nThis is the beginning of an odyssey which recalls sometimes that of the two tragic heroes of the Japanese masterpiece &quot; grave of the fireflies&quot;. The brat becomes a paper boy,a shoe-shiner and tries to stay a child in a world gone mad.Some adults are selfish and ruthless ,some others -an European nurse notably-lends a helpful hand .\n\nIt seems ,at the end of the movie,that the father has finally understood that a child&apos;s smile is worth all the ideological struggles in the world.\n\nRaoul Coutard was a famous N.V. cameraman ;he directed only a handful of movies:this one is certainly the most interesting."

While this is a film better seen by children of certain age group, it&apos;s not a Disney product, and parents should be aware of that fact. Some comments in this IMDb forum criticize the film makers for what they perceive was a marketing ploy that targeted the movie to small children. Perhaps the people that promoted the film are to be blamed for that, or maybe Mr. Annaud was targeting the film for a more mature audience.\n\n&quot;Two Brothers&quot; is a story about two tigers that are separated at a young stage of their lives, while their parents are killed by people that loved to engage in this type of hunting. The two little cubs are about the best in the film as one see them getting in all kinds of adventures in the first part of the film.\n\nThe story behind the animals serves the film as it provides an accessible background as it illustrates the inter action between humans and animals. Guy Pearce and Freddie Highmore are seen in the film as Aidan and Raoul. Freddie Highmore is a child actor with an expressive face that shows a child of great intelligence without any trace of ego.\n\nAs Mr. Annaud proved with &quot;The Bear&quot;, he has a good eye for involving the animals in his stories about them with surprising results.",

      "reviewBody": "Not one for reviewing recklessly, this film definitely caused me to change my tune and glad to be the first.\n\nA surprisingly dark yet delightful watch that will undoubtedly stay under the radar despite deserving (in my mind) much wider public acknowledgement !\n\nWorm manages to inject awkward and continuous humour to a fairly dark,futuristic situation (mainly and very successfully carried by the main character Charles-John Ferguson). Based on a future parasite that will have you dreaming a new life up for yourself for endless hours of enjoyment, but will eventually be your downfall, with withdrawal being worse than heroin - worm accomplishes an uncomfortably sickening stir like that of a thriller and definitely contains horrific moments leading to many small plot twists that carry the fast pace and interest to the very end.\n\nAlthough the plot could be considered to draw comparisons with the downward spiral of drug addiction, I would say the film does not hyper focus on this, which in turn makes you realise it is not the only sole point, and gives way to more intrigue, whereby intelligently leaving characters actions and intentions open to interpretation, dealing with many societal cross relating flaws of relationships, friendships, animal attachments, power of the media, loneliness, mental health and subsequently gang culture, and degradation of normal, as the lines become blurred. \n\nclever use of &apos;live&apos; news reports and clips dropped in are a nice addition to involve the viewer and trigger a reminder of the ulterior reality that is being portrayed here. \n\nYou can&apos;t help but feel the sense of deja vu as the mainly quirky but cheerful classical Esq musical score draws comparisons with the critically acclaimed - ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, along with other elements of the switch between dream and reality shots filmed melting into one another and the beautiful arty character shots of Charles and his growing love interest - June (Jes Mercer) slowly falling for each other whilst living off their individual &apos;fantasite&apos; addiction. With the similar clairvoyant look at the future apparent here. \n\nThis nostalgia that is evoked is followed with a feeling that other influence and inspiration for the close and long juxtaposed camera angles switching quite often, and the delicacy of the character development draws similar to the dark classic - REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.\n\nBoth films of which in my eyes, helped build the modern film epidemic. \n\nThe cross elements of romance and comedy that flow throughout make it hard to box into a genre, but truly display how you do not need a big Hollywood budget to create a thought provoking modern gem. \n\nAll acting and character development retains strength throughout, and there is simply not a weak strand to this production. \n\nThough you may be feeling the ending lacks explanation. All in all a tremendous piece by director Doug Mallette, that all cast and crew added to positively.\n\nAlthough I&apos;m sure you could micro pick small holes in the plot making of this film, I don&apos;t think it would be worthwhile considering the enjoyment of watching it. A definite &apos;should&apos; watch for all!! Especially those intrigued with a bit of grim squirming dark humour, with impressive characterisation and content. 8 ******** from me!",

However, the overall acting and situations were just a bit too &quot;out there&quot; to be believable. Yes, I&apos;m sure there are closeted preachers and thugs who prey upon the fears of gays by day and prowl for men at night. But the depths of the hatred from these characters in the film made them seem more like villainous caricatures than 3-dimensional people. But I&apos;m giving 5 stars for effort, as well as the allusions the film made towards spirituality and the afterlife...the only non-preachy part about this film that respectfully and intelligently left it up to the viewer to decide.",

He is sent to investigate the murder of Million Wong by going undercover as the millionaire. Throughout the ordeal, he finds out that his girlfriend, Min, is dating the murder suspect.\n\nAs with many of Stephen Chow&apos;s films, this one has no shortage of slapstick humor and ridiculous action-comedy. Chow does his acting pretty well, this time playing two different characters, and inserts some neat suspenseful scenes where appropriate.\n\nThis sequel has much goofy scenes here and there, especially its obvious spoof to the movie Basic Instinct, but this was still a rather entertaining film with some surprising and unpredictable moments.\n\nGrade B-",

The acting was both bad and good; at points it was natural, at points terrible. The film was well shot, the locations real dirty and gritty and there we&apos;re some beautiful shots of landscapes and women, along with some wonderfully freaky imagery. Other highlights include the music; you have folksy guitar rhythms, charming b-movie pulsating synths, and a wonderful dancing hippie sequence towards the end. If you&apos;re into rare b movies, and can tolerate bad editing, incomprehensible story lines, and characters narrating the story directly into the camera, it&apos;s worth seeking out for the hippies alone.",

      "reviewBody": "How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you&apos;ve seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you&apos;ve been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that&apos;s me.\n\nNotwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to &quot;move&quot; me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan&apos;s room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That&apos;s for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don&apos;t know and I don&apos;t care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don&apos;t watch this film if you&apos;re looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don&apos;t even skip this film thinking it&apos;s children&apos;s movie  no it isn&apos;t. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people&apos;s lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.\n\nOkay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it&apos;s two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They&apos;re there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.\n\nAamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That&apos;s the surprise but you don&apos;t miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;d say go and watch the film. I wouldn&apos;t recommend if you&apos;re addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.",

      "reviewBody": "Chocolat is a good film. The plot is indeed very good, and despite being simple at a first sight it have various layers and subtle symbolism, specifically in the &apos;chocolate&apos; types. For example, for the boy with a spicy personality, bitter chocolate she offered. And to the woman depressed, scarred by life,with bitter personality, she then offered spicy chocolate. The chocolat itself represented some kind of a freedom and liberation of the repressed side of the persons. Very interesting, and it&apos;s definitely a film to be appreciated. The way the city reacts is also very curious. The characters which appears in the film have special kind of personality and a subtle meaning in them as well. And is up to the viewer to discover what these meanings are.\n\nThe art direction is also good, very suggestive and definitely is important to the film overall. The natural aura that the film exudes has much to do with the excellent work in the lightning and in the scenario,with rudimentary, but harmful stores in the small Italian city. The soundtrack is wonderful, and fits perfectly each scene. The acting is overall very good, Alfred Molina,Julliete Binoche and Judi Dench specifically are stunning in their roles.\n\nI highly recommend this film. 8.2/10",

      "reviewBody": "from Dane Youssef\n\nThe Brat Pack actors are certainly a talented bunch. Everyone has a favorite. For me, it&apos;s a toss-up between James Spader and Anthony Michael Hall.\n\nJohn Cusack was mesmerizing back in his early-days. He was a teenager, but he looked, sounded and acted very adult for his age. &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; put him on the map and &quot;Say Anything...&quot; made him a household name.\n\nBut while Crowe&apos;s &quot;Say Anything...&quot; was obviously a great movie, it was both a blessing and a curse for Cusack, who has rarely played anything else in his career. I know, I know. He&apos;s been in countless other movies. But &quot;a rose by any other name...&quot; His character, no matter what the movie, is essentially always Lloyd Dobbler.\n\nSpader sometimes played other types besides the oily Steff from &quot;Pretty in Pink.&quot; His typecast-breaking turn came when he played the lead in this movie. \n\nBut I know Cusack can do more. I keep waiting for him to. Which was one of my guilty pleasures of this movie.\n\nThe story and plot are the right out of the old fable about the rich man and the poor man who come together and create something special... and then the rich man betrays the poor man and casts him aside. And the poor man plots to take revenge...\n\nAnother big twist that &quot;True Colors&quot; has is it&apos;s twist in typecasting. Cusack specializes in playing sharp, calculated, smarter-than-average teenager... who&apos;s heartbroken and devastated... and is desperately trying to win back the girl. Here, Cusack plays a character who&apos;s as smart as the heroes he usually plays, though here he uses his intellectual gifts for evil instead of good. His goal is usually to win the girl&apos;s heart. Here he betrays the girl (and his close friend) in order to get what he wants.\n\nAnd Spader usually plays blue-blooded, silver-spoon fed, upper-class yuppie scummy villains. Here he&apos;s still a rich blue-blooded yuppie. But a hero, who uses his financial connections to right wrongs and do just.\n\nThe two meet the first day of law school where there&apos;s a fender-bender and brief scuffle. Cusack angrily attacks Spader violently and blames him for the whole thing and the two have to be pulled apart. Later on, things get worse as they discover... their assigned to be roommates. Cusack smooths things over by admitting the whole thing was his fault. You&apos;ll see why.\n\nAfterwords, the two form a fast friendship and Spader even uses his financial backgrounds and connections to help Cusack out. Later we find out that Cusack is lying about his background to fit in and the payoff feels lifted out of a soppy, moralizing and insipid sit-com where today&apos;s moral is... &quot;If you have to be someone else to get a friend, then they&apos;re really not your friend.&quot;\n\nRichard Widmark is great as well as the ailing senator who sees potential and ambition in Cusack after he sees what looks like Cusack doing him a favor, little realizing how dangerous Cusack is. Spader girlfriend considers breaking off the relationship for Cusack who can keep her bringing in big cash. She doesn&apos;t realize that Cusack is willing to betray her too, in order to get what he wants.\n\nOne of the major problems is that their true colors are obvious from the beginning. Cusack is clearly someone not to trust from the start and Spader all but actually walks on water. Another is that the movie is too thin. There isn&apos;t enough entry.\n\nThe movie... skims too much of the surface. And Spader&apos;s big plan and the finale is pretty tacked on.\n\nThe movie aspires to be a movie like &quot;Patriot Games&quot; or &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; But everything is routine and predictable and there are precious few new touches to this tired formula. If screenwriter Kevin Wade could&apos;ve given the script a bit more depth and discovery into these characters and done a little more with the formula, this could have really been something special. The cast does what it can, but inevitably, a good cast can only take a movie so far. Still, it&apos;s worth seeing just for Cusack turn towards the dark side and Spader as a yuppie with heart.\n\nOh, well...\n\n--Filled With Personal Politics, Dane Youssef",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; is the lavish and classic 1959 film by MGM that is based on an 1880 novel by Lew Wallace, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.&quot; It is a remake of MGM&apos;s 1925 silent film that had the full title of the novel. The story is a fictional adventure set in the time of Christ. The religious aspect is toned down and subtly built into this adaptation of Wallace&apos;s story, beginning with an opening scene of the nativity.\n\nThe film plot centers around the family of Judah Ben-Hur during the time the Roman Empire occupied Israel. The main characters are Judah and Messala. The latter is a Roman soldier who grew up as a boyhood friend of Judah. The Ben-Hurs were a wealthy family with a trade business. Now, in adult times the two men become enemies - until Judah&apos;s interior conversion. That occurs after chance encounters with a mysterious man. He later learns that this is Jesus of Nazareth, whom Esther and some others think may be the promised Messiah.\n\nThe film has a great cast of the day. Charlton Heston gives an Oscar-winning performance as Judah Ben-Hur. And Hugh Griffith won best supporting actor for his role of Sheik Ilderim. All of the cast excel - Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius, Stephen Boyd as Messala, Martha Scott as Miriam, Sam Jaffe as Simonides, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate, and more. In its day, this film was the most expensive movie ever made, at just over $15 million. But its box office was nearly 10 times that amount. &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was the first film to win 11 Oscars at the Academy Awards. Only two more films have accomplished that since then. They are &quot;Titanic&quot; of 1997 and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; of 2003.\n\nFrom the time MGM first announced it would remake the film in color, it took several years to get it done. It went through a number of planned casting changes, and screenplays and rewrites. If for nothing else, this movie likely always will be known for its spectacular chariot race. It took nearly a year just to plan the race, acquire the horses, build the chariots, and train and practice for the race.\n\nAt 18 acres, the race arena was the largest film set ever made to that time. It took 1,000 men a year to make the track in a rock quarry. That was done so it would look real -- like the historic circus that had been in Jerusalem. It took more than 40,000 tons of sand from the Mediterranean to cover the race track. Numerous other aspects made the chariot race so unique and unlikely ever to be repeated for real. Charlton Heston was an accomplished rider and horse handler already. But when he got to Rome he took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving. He had special contact lenses to protect his eyes from injury by the dirt kicked up by the horses.\n\nThe chariot race is an historic feature of this film. It&apos;s not likely that modern moviemakers would ever again go to such lengths to have and film such a realistic race. Just look at the 2016 revised &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; film with its heavy use of CGI. The crash scenes in that chariot race are almost laughable.\n\nThis tremendous film was greatly condensed and adapted from a novel of more than 500 pages. And, the story of the book author himself, is fascinating. Lewis Wallace (1827-1905) was a man of many talents and careers. He was a soldier, a lawyer, a politician and a diplomat. His writing career overlapped all of these. Wallace served in the Mexican-American War and fought in the American Civil War. He commanded an Indiana regiment of the Union Army and took part in several battles. He later rose to the rank of Maj. General. He served nearly four years as governor of the New Mexico Territory (1878-1881). And he was U. S. minister to the Ottoman Empire from 1881 to 1885. After that he retired to continue his writing career which began with publication of his first book in 1873, &quot;The Fair God.&quot;\n\nWallace wrote his adventure novel, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ,&quot; as a story of revenge and redemption. He worked on it for several years during his military postings. When it was published in 1880, the book made Wallace famous and wealthy. It was translated into seven languages and became popular around the world. It sold more than 400,000 copies in less than a decade. By 1900, it had become the best-selling American novel of the 19th century.\n\nThis is an epic film with a message that is subtly delivered in a most entertaining package. The actors all show the right amounts of various emotions throughout. The sets and settings, and filming and color are superb in all respects. Audiences should enjoy this film for generations to come.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Thelma and Louise.  However, the film also shows more of the realistic but negative side of the life of fugitives... though the cinematography of Messidor is fantastic, with panoramic views of the Swiss countryside, some of the longer visual sequences may seem extraneous to those who might be anticipating non-stop action.  Yet the game of adventure that the girls play lacks the aftertaste of Hollywood artifice, seeming truly spontaneous, natural, and creating a more lasting impact with the resulting consequences.  Moreover, the film&apos;s dialogue and characterization are strong.  Having seen Messidor, I can now understand why this film is considered a classic.",

Although the term may be better remembered as slang for &quot;something easily accomplished&quot;, it arose as a term for a type of mock-serious dancing practiced by Black slaves in the Pre-Civil War South, in which they danced in what they imagined was the manner of their manners. there are several conflicting explanations of how cake became involved, including an award of a cake for the best couple, as well as a mutation of some word from the language the slaves (or their ancestors) spoke in Africa. Because there&apos;s no compelling evidence to support any hypothesis, I&apos;ll leave it at that, and note that the ridiculous figures the dancers cut might have arisen through lack of cultural continuity between the polite, dances of the west in the 19th century, and the dances of the slaves (or, again, their ancestors) back in Africa.\n\nWhich is more than enough to write about a 12-second snippet of film.",

Officially, Fabian is Madame Claude, the owner of a Parisian modeling agency. It is an open secret, however, that her operation actually traffics in expensive call girls for the wealthy and powerful. Some of these girls will undergo blackmail, because David, photographer of trade, has images of these Johns in compromising positions. An awesome erotic film that shows all the actresses on different stages of undress. One of the greatest sex scenes ever taking place early on in a hot tub.",

      "reviewBody": "Well now then after a comment like that how can I back it up. Well firstly by stating that this is obviously a subjective view.\n\nBut to the movie.\n\nThis was released in the UK on video in the early 1980&apos;s. It&apos;s the story of Benji, Bobby and Huey, well atleast those were the names in the English translation. This is an Israeli [not sure if that&apos;s how you spell that but you get the point] movie. It tells the story of the Boys search for Love and..... Sex basically. Making the point early on that the two are not necessarily connected.\n\nBenji the &quot;quiet&quot; one falls for a girl who he invites to a party, she says no but then turns up with his best friend, the `good looking&apos; one, True to life or what! She eventually succumbs to Bobby&apos;s advances, and gets pregnant, at which point he dumps her. Benji stands by her organising an abortion and paying for it, well I never said this was a family film. At which point as soon as they return home .. well check out the end yourself, if you can get a copy that is, why I don&apos;t know but this is almost impossible to obtain a copy of. Other stories revolve around the boys visit to a prostitute, their catching of an embarrassing condition, And their run in with an Italian nymphomaniac while delivering ice.\n\nSo basically if you want to categorise this movie it&apos;s a sex comedy set in the 1960&apos;s. But it&apos;s more than that. For a start it has one of the best soundtracks I&apos;ve ever heard, and the story and characterisation is in my opinion well up to the standard of Hollywood"

The story is simplistic, predictable and weak. Some of the subplots are uninteresting and don&apos;t really fit with the main story. It starts off slow and the tense atmosphere is very well maintained. \n\nThis is no slasher flick. It&apos;s mostly atmospheric and that&apos;s where it succeeds. The creepy and claustrophobic interiors of Bobby&apos;s building and the stylistic execution, first rate cinematography and sound effects contribute very well in creating tension. While the lead character Bobby is well developed, I felt that the other characters suffered from poor writing. Jesse Bradford is excellent and he confidently carries the movie displaying depth and restraint. Iza Calzado is very good despite the way her role was written.\n\nAs flawed as it is, it&apos;s not a bad suggestion for a one-time watch especially for those who enjoy films of this kind."

      "name": "A Low-Budget Spanish Western",
      "reviewBody": "After being ambushed by hostile Indians, a bounty hunter by the name of &quot;Sam Foster&quot; (James Philbrook) manages to ride to a nearby abandoned fort where a young woman named &quot;Mary Patterson&quot; (Nuria Torray) is able to successfully bandage his wounds without any major problems. While he&apos;s mending, however, he hears reports about a bank robbery in the town nearby and-being a bounty hunter-he immediately sets out to round up the suspects involved. The problem is that Mary&apos;s younger brother &quot;Jimmy Patterson&quot; (Julio Perez Tabernero) is mixed up with these outlaws and the mere mention of his culpability immediately turns her against Sam. To complicate matters even more, Jimmy already holds an intense dislike for Sam which makes any encounter between the two fraught with danger for both people involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this could have been an okay Spanish Western if not for the poor editing and rather shallow character development. On that note, it definitely could have used a bit more passion between Sam and Mary-or possibly even Jimmy and &quot;Rita&quot; (Perla Cristal). Likewise, I should also mention that this film goes by various titles with the one I happened to watch being called &quot;Django, a Bullet for You&quot; even though the actual character named &quot;Django&quot; is not in this film. No doubt the fact that this was a low-budget, grade-B film probably necessitated gimmicks of this nature for financially reasons if nothing else. Be that as it may, while this wasn&apos;t a bad movie necessarily, it definitely could have used some improvement and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",

I almost would say I like Shadowless Sword more if only director didn&apos;t made special effects awkward.\n\nMaybe it is just me, but I expect that after hitting objects can explode, but not after cutting. And here some objects fall apart (with great speed and energy) what looks amazing (with proper music) but some... explode, which is not funny, not spectacular, not magical, not mysterious -- it is simply bizarre. It is so out-of-place that it spoils every fight scene when director decided to put explosion after sword cut. Pity...",

Some very impressive interiors are beautifully shot - the cathedral that serves as intelligence hq, and the castle or chateau that is the German command hq.

The plot to kill their husbands is a funny adventure through the minds of three &apos;not so bright&apos; amateurs trying to figure out how exactly do you kill someone when you&apos;ve never done it before? \n\nThe film is reminiscent of the blockbuster &apos;First Wives Club&apos; where a similar plot unfolded, except revenge was merely the removal of the husband&apos;s lifestyles! \n\nAn excellent film, bright and light hearted comedy. A pleasure to watch and listen too. A delightful change from the usual &apos;super clean&apos; and emotionless boring American dialogue.\n\nGreat &apos;sight gags&apos; and plenty of unique Dutch humour. Even the spoken English is a laugh! \n\nIt could do with English subtitles though, as this would appeal to a wider audience and distribution.",

      "reviewBody": "Here we go again, another mediocre entry to the Amityville franchise that seems to get less interesting the further along it goes. I don&apos;t know, but I do miss the ominous house itself which featured prominently in the first three films. Sure it has connections and even the image of it appears in the haunted antique mirror which came from infamous Long Island house, but it&apos;s just not the same. The straight-to-video fare &quot;A New Generation&quot; is the seventh film, where the terror scraps suburbia for an urban apartment building filled with budding artists who one-by- one fall to the evil entity. \n\nAn antique mirror is given to a photographer by a homeless man. Soon after accepting the gift, the man starts having haunting visions of a killing spree which might just have some relevance to him. But he&apos;s not the only one who&apos;s been affected by the demonic force within the mirror, but those living in his studio building begin to find themselves possessed/or infatuated by these dark forces. \n\nThe plot tries to tie in a little more to the history of the Long House island, especially with the main character&apos;s (an affable Ross Partridge) connection to what&apos;s actually happening. So most of the time is spent with Partridge&apos;s character trying to uncover the truth and dealing with flashbacks. Didn&apos;t make it any more interesting though. Predictable and interchangeable. The imitating special effects do have its moments, but there&apos;s a real lack of atmosphere and thrills. Sure it&apos;s slickly directed, but feels vapid and flat. There&apos;s a good supporting cast featuring Terry O&apos;Quinn, Richard Roundtree. Julia Nickson-Soul and a very twitchy David Naughton that do enliven things.\n\nHardly terrible, but rather uninspired.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1928, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (Mary Steenburgen) in her early 30s moves to a blindly bought orange grove near the hamlet of Cross Creek, in northern Florida, which is located on a strip of land between two large lakes (Orange Lake and Lochloosa Lake). There she hopes to find the peace and privacy to launch her writing career. Peter Coyote plays a hotel owner from a nearby town that becomes fascinated by Marjorie while Alfre Woodard plays her maid. Rip Torn is on hand as an eccentric backwoodsman with Dana Hill appearing as his daughter who befriends a fawn.\n\n&quot;Cross Creek&quot; (1983) is a historical drama about the famous author of &quot;The Yearling&quot;; it&apos;s also part wilderness drama. Shot on location in gorgeous Alachua &amp; Marion Counties, the film&apos;s worth watching just for the remote Floridian lushness. The theme is to die for as Marjorie DECIDES what she wants to do and then boldly (or stubbornly) DOES IT, come what may. Her first two short stories were published in 1931 and &quot;The Yearling&quot; in 1938, which won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was made into a movie in 1946.\n\nThe boggy locations are similar to those in &quot;Frogs&quot; (1972) and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982) while the topic and themes are reminiscent of &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sounder&quot; (1972). If you favor the latter two movies and appreciate the locations of the former two, you&apos;ll enjoy &quot;Cross Creek.&quot;\n\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B/B+",

Inevitably as they start to take charge of their lives, their outlook and relationships start to change. The acting is excellent and the characters are believable. Sue Heel has written an amusing script.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t try and appeal to a trans-Atlantic audience, so there are no-American stars. It just looks like life in Newcastle, warts and all. As a British expat living in the U.S. it was good to be reminded about the existence of saveloys and chips.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Heinrich Breloer has throughout his career shown interest in classic German literature. This is one of the more ambitious efforts by Breloer, an adaptation of Thomas Mann&apos;s massive family saga from 1901. It&apos;s not Breloer&apos;s first stab at the Nobel-winning writer, since he previously made a miniseries about his life (2001), with actor Armin Mueller-Stahl in the lead role. They re-team in &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; (2008), with Mueller-Stahl playing the family patriarch. He gives the only memorable performance in the film.\n\nThomas Mann is near-impossible to adapt, not just because of the great length of his finest novels, but the psychological depth in them, the detailed depiction of the present moment and the philosophical nature of the dialogue. The bar has been set pretty low, with efforts such as Hans W. Geissendörfer&apos;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; (1982), which turned the existential mystery of life into something resembling Kubrick&apos;s &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). The worst offense you can commit against a writer like Mann in an adaptation, is to be in a hurry. And unfortunately, by choosing the format of a feature film instead of a television series, you are forced to do just that.\n\nI personally prefer &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; to &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; as a novel. They have a quarter of a century between them, and Mann has clearly developed as a psychological narrator by &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;. Still, the earlier work is great as well, though it is more enjoyable near the beginning than near its end. This adaptation is two and a half hours long, so it doesn&apos;t feel like too much time has elapsed by the end of it. Yet, the super-fast tempo makes the whole very uninteresting. The characters aren&apos;t fleshed out to have personalities, and the financial decline of the family starts way too abruptly.\n\nBreloer is clearly working with a considerable budget, as the outdoor scenes looked nice and fitting for the historical period. Yet every single scene in this film goes over too fast. You don&apos;t get to enjoy the epoch. Together with the rushed pace of the screenplay, the polished visuals make the characters look unrealistically clean, and empty in spirit.\n\nHad he chosen to do this as an eight hour miniseries, this might be a pretty watchable adaptation. Yet I fear to say that even then Breloer would not have been a unique enough film-maker, and the end product would have been a visual re-telling of the novel, instead of a well-thought-out, personal art work of its own. If this makes you interested about Thomas Mann, it&apos;s good, but that&apos;s unlikely.\n\nRead the book instead, it wins you over really fast.",

There are a lot of good things happening in this movie but it would only be half the film without him. This film is producer by Empire Pictures, a now defunct Charles Band headed studio that was responsible for a lot of cool mid-80&apos;s genre films (Troll, Ghoulies and Eliminators come to mind). The direction has flare and the script is decent. The music by Pino Donaggio is excellent. \tIt&apos;s fun but the script should have had more. I wanted to know more about the character, in particular the Gunther characters past.\n\n\t\t\tThe Lesson Learned: \tThat said it wouldn&apos;t make a high brow top ten list for that year but it would make a genre fan happy. I enjoyed it and you might too. So be it."

      "reviewBody": "I love Machete. The character is incredible, the premise is perfect, literally everything about it just screams B-movie stupidity, and it&apos;s insanely awesome. I actually saw this movie before the first Machete so I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect, and I laughed until it hurt. Seriously, it was everything I wanted in a silly action movie. Machete Kills is somehow even more ridiculous than the first one, this time with president Charlie Sheen ordering Machete to go after a lunatic nuclear arms dealer played to perfection by Demian Bichir, and Mel Gibson wants to destroy the world and colonize space. Yeah, and you thought De Niro playing George Bush was crazy. Mel Gibson is basically a Bond villain in this movie. \n\nThis is another revenge story, except this time it&apos;s Machete&apos;s love interest Jessica Alba who is killed in front of him. Needless to say when President Sheen asks him to go on this suicide mission, Machete isn&apos;t exactly in the best frame of mind. Then again, it&apos;s f*cking Danny Trejo, so he&apos;s awesome at it anyway. The first half of the movie focuses more on Machete going after this crazy arms dealer, with random villains like Sofia Vergara with machine gun tits coming after him. There&apos;s also the shapeshifter El Cameleon played by Cuba Gooding Jr, Lady Gaga, and Antonio Banderas. Literally the best plot device to get as many famous people in a movie as possible. Then Mel kicks in during the second half of the movie and that&apos;s where it goes full-on ridiculous mode (in the best way, as if it wasn&apos;t ridiculous enough before).\n\nAfter seeing Machete and Machete Kills back to back, I realize the only thing that makes Machete Kills slightly weaker is that the laughs aren&apos;t as consistent. Machete had me on the floor 90 percent of the time. Machete Kills is more like, 70 percent hilarity and 30 percent of jokes that either don&apos;t hit or are just repeated to the point of desensitization. Still, when the jokes hit, they are laugh-out-loud funny. There are gags in this movie that make the original Machete look like a documentary. Oh, and Amber Heard is the special agent helping Machete this time, and she tries to do an accent every once in a while and fails miserably, but who cares because she&apos;s sex on a stick. That&apos;s basically the trend in these movies. You try to analyze something and then think to yourself, &quot;Who cares?&quot; It&apos;s so damn entertaining you don&apos;t have to think at all. Just lay back and enjoy the gratuitous violence, T&amp;A, and everything else you&apos;d want in a ridiculous action-packed B-movie. I, for one, cannot wait for the sequel.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a history teacher and sometimes use films to discuss American history. In particular, we discuss and learn about the earliest films and historically important films. While some of these films are just brief little snippets (like the very early Edison films) and some are extremely dated and dull by today&apos;s standards (THE JAZZ SINGER comes to mind), some of the films we discuss have aged very well and are still great entertainment. One such important but still entertaining early films is THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. It was intended as a silent film, but with the success of &quot;talkies&quot;, the studio decided to add dialog and very loud sound effects to this very early sci-fi film taken from the Jules Verne novel. At times, the sound works very well--such as in the beginning when there is a lot of dialog (provided the record of the sounds was timed perfectly--fortunately on video and DVD this isn&apos;t a problem). At other times, it looks like a silent movie with a few tacked on sounds (similar to what happened with Harold Lloyd&apos;s WELCOME DANGER). However, despite this &quot;hybrid&quot; nature of the film, it is still very entertaining--and a lot of fun to see sci-fi done in the old fashioned way. The undersea sequences are of course dated, but not really that bad for 1929--in fact, I found them to be pretty charming. An interesting and entertaining film even today with a good performance from the great Lionel Barrymore.",

Shredder asks the help of an unwillingly scientist (David Warner) to make his mutant allies, Rahzar and Tokka. The Turles seeks help with the young pizza deliver boy-Keno (Ernie Reyes, Jr.). The Heroes dive into action and of course, Pizza! \n\nDirected by Michael Pressman (Doctor Detroit, Some Kind of Hero, To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday) made an entertaining sequel. This is a bigger budgeted film than the first movie. As usual, the highlight is the animatronic characters by Jim Henson&apos;s creature shop. The plot of the sequel is extremely silly but never boring. Paige Turco replaced Judith Hoag from the original and Turco is appealing in the film. Too Bad, Elias Koteas didn&apos;t return for the sequel and Corey Feldman didn&apos;t return to voice Donatello also. The film was a hit like the original. The only flaw in the sequel is the ending, which it is a mess. Rapper:Vanilla Ice appears in a embarrassing cameo. This sequel is amusing for the kids and fun for the fans of the comic book series.

      "reviewBody": "The film has a very simple basic premise. Television has been reduced to the lowest common denominator and people swallow it because they have gotten used to it. As such, they are reduced to an antisocial drone-like resistance that no longer resembles life as our fathers remember. Improve what&apos;s on the TV and you&apos;ll improve society.\n\nFor someone who&apos;s himself quite sick of all those reality soaps and the garbage that comes out from the Hollywood assembly line, I found this film refreshing and inspirational. Although I wasn&apos;t quite fond of the obvious ultra-left ideology you can find in between the lines, the message of this film goes beyond ideology and is a call to all of us.\n\n&quot;Democratic&quot; capitalist society has become a tyrannical system run by corporations who enslave us for profit, while we, the average consumer, are barely aware of the golden cage in which we live. We&apos;ve all become paranoid little f***&apos;s who waste our time on shallow small talk and brainless entertainment rather than having real conversations on real topics and devouring real culture. This film tries to open your eyes to that reality and reach the inner child in all of us.... the inner child that makes us human.\n\nObviously this film doesn&apos;t have the budget of a Hollywood blockbuster and the story is most definitely naive, but the very optimism of this film and its lonely dissident cry make it far more interesting to me than anything Hollywood has produced since &quot;V For Vendetta&quot;.\n\nThat&apos;s all I have to say......",

Even when it&apos;s clear something isn&apos;t right, the father tries to prevent his daughter from leaving, thinking it too dangerous. Of course when her boyfriend volunteers, said father encourages him.\n\nThe problem? Well, after people start dying, without expendable characters the character dynamics fall apart, resulting in a horror movie considerably less entertaining when the horror begins than previously.\n\nAt &quot;Gorezone Weekend of Horrors&quot;, it did have one scene which made the audience gasp due to shock.

      "reviewBody": "The Mothman Prophecies is a solid thriller. It&apos;s supposedly based on true events, but even if it weren&apos;t, it would be worth a look. Richard Gere stars as a Washington Post reporter who inexplicably finds himself in a small West Virginia town where a series of strange goings-on have been happening. His wife was killed two years prior in a mysterious car accident, and there seems to be a connection between her death and the strange happenings in Point Pleasant. Holding the key behind the mystery seems to be a large moth-like creature who tends to show up in places where the loss of human life is about to occur. Gere meets up with several locals who claim to have seen the Mothman, and after a while this creature begins communicating with him. The creature warns people of tragedies about to strike (plane crashes, earthquakes), and Gere thinks this creature can even put him in contact with his dead wife. Gere is given a warning about an upcoming tragedy near Point Pleasant, but can he act in time to stop it? Or should he even try? The film is very moody and sullen. The direction and photography are top drawer, and they enhance the mood greatly. The acting is terrific, as well. I usually can&apos;t stand Gere, but he&apos;s great in this film. Laura Linney would seem miscast as a local cop, but by the end of the film, she will have proved how truly talented she is. Will Patton is outstanding as a local resident who has several run-ins with the Mothman until it drives him crazy.\n\nWhat exactly is the Mothman? According to this film, he&apos;s some type of oracle. He can see bad things that will happen, and he can even see through to the other side. Does he cause these tragedies? The film would seem to argue not. Though he may have caused the fatal car accident that took Gere&apos;s wife early on. Apparently the concept of the Mothman has been around for a while, but this film gives a pretty good explanation of it for those of us who had never heard of it before.\n\nThe film came up short of its $40 million budget in theaters. I blame this on a terrible marketing campaign, and some bad reviews from the big name critics. Don&apos;t let their reviews scare you away. This film is very good. I was hooked after seeing only a couple minutes of it. It was the very effective scene where Gere and Patton first meet up at his home one evening. That was well done! Be warned, however. The film will likely leave you feeling very mortal, and maybe even depressed. There is a really cool new-age rock song during the credits that also adds to the mood.\n\nConsider this film a thinking man&apos;s Final Destination. The climactic scene at the end could have even wandered in from one of those movies. The Mothman Prophecies is worth about 8 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",

      "reviewBody": "Made four years before Night of the Living Dead, The Last Man on Earth tells a very similar story. Based on Richard Matheson&apos;s novel &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, the film tells the tale of a terrible plague that has wiped out all of mankind and replaced them with vampire-zombie like creatures. Well, it&apos;s almost wiped mankind out - one man, Vincent Price, still remains. Now that he has inherited the Earth, the last surviving human has to hunt these creatures by day and then hole up in his house during the night. Vincent Price says most of dialogue in voice over, which gives this apocalyptic horror film a great element of pessimism, which is essential in order for the film to work. The way that Price reads his lines is done in such a way that it seems he has simply given up all hope, and this helps the tragic element of the movie, which is this film&apos;s main backbone. The dreary black and white cinematography helps this element of the film also, as it adds the degree of hopelessness and pessimism, which this story thrives on.\n\nQuite how this film has reached the ripe old age of forty and still not garnered the praise and respect it deserves is beyond me. While Night of the Living Dead deserves the praise for &apos;really&apos; creating the zombie movie that we all now know and love, this film got the theme first, and thus deserves it&apos;s place in the annals of film history. The story, even without the horror of the zombie creatures, still makes for fascinating food for thought. The idea of being left all alone on the Earth is simultaneously fascinating and horrifying, and by showing us the things that the protagonist has do every day to ward off the vampires (mirrors and garlic on the doors, hunting them by day), along with such quotes as &quot;another day to live through&quot; show the true horror of the idea behind the film. Of course, Vincent Price is one of the greatest actors of all time and his presence in the movie is easily one of the highlights. Price&apos;s great screen presence helps to offset the obvious low budget of the film and even during the slower moments, The Last Man on Earth still ensures that we are interested in what&apos;s going on, just by the fact that Price is there. On the whole, this is an extraordinarily brilliant film and one that deserves your viewing!",

      "reviewBody": "Even if there is no apparent reason to the anguish. This movies tells us the different stories of three women living in different times but united by the same thread: the difficulty to harmonize the world that is within their heads with the world outside which is so much different from the former. The first one is a real character: the famous British novelist Virginia Woolf whose novels depict characters so much like the other two and who has ended up by committing suicide at the age of 58 by drowning herself in a river. There is one of her most famous novels, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; that is over present in the movie since the novelist is precisely writing it at the time and feeling greatly moved and even anguished by that creative work. Of the other two women who lived much later, one is reading the book and the other one is called Mrs. Dalloway by a friend who is a poet and dying of AIDS, probably because he thought that she was much like the character in the novel. Suicide is also present in the other stories in a dramatic way. The image sequences in the movie are constantly crossing themselves, telling the three stories simultaneously thus underlining the similitude of the episodes in the life of the three women and in their states of mind. To appreciate this movie you must be familiar with Virginia Woolf&apos;s peculiar sensitivity so well expressed in her novels and the characters she created. This is not a realist movie and rather a movie where just like in her novels the most important feature is the stream of consciousness within the women&apos;s minds sometimes shown in acts or words and sometimes by the silence or their face&apos;s expressions. The movie direction and the actresses&apos; performance is rather successful in making us feel in tune with it all.",

      "reviewBody": "Having watched Kurosawa&apos;s retelling of Dostoyevsky&apos;s &quot;The Idiot&quot; a couple weeks ago, and come away feeling that one viewing was already a bit too much, I was not expecting much from this. After all, Gorky is generally regarded as a notch or three below Dostoyevsky.\n\nBut whereas &quot;The Idiot&quot; did not begin to mesh with a Japanese idiom, &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; fits in very well indeed. Much of the film involves the hopes, dreams, schemes and machinations of a handful of characters, all fixated on escaping the tenement and its soul-numbing poverty.\n\nAn enigmatic old man who appears one day and spends some time in the hovel has a salutary effect on several of the residents, merely by dint of a level of kindness and sympathy that any of us would take for granted. When he leaves, the spark of compassion he has kindled dies quickly. Yet before he arrives and after he has left, there nonetheless remains a minimal spirit of camaraderie. I have not read Gorky&apos;s novel, but the &quot;depths&quot; here may (be taken to) refer to this bare-minimum level of feeling for one&apos;s fellow paupers.\n\nRunning through the script is the theme of lies and (self-)deception, and how they can ease the bitter reality that society&apos;s outcasts must face every day. This above all works well here, for the Japanese themselves have a utilitarian (so to speak) view of truth and falsehoods. The hoary Japanese adage &quot;uso mo houben&quot;, often rendered &quot;a white lie can be expedient&quot;, could have been a tagline for this movie; for the alcoholic ex-actor and several others have little other than self-delusion to help them get through another day.\n\nKurosawa manages to inject a measure of droll comedy while keeping the grim facts unprettified, showing us how the luckless souls at the very bottom of society grasp at the slimmest of hopes and somehow manage (...or don&apos;t manage) to keep on going. Superb.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1992, in Madrid, the secretary and escort girl Lena (Penélope Cruz) becomes the mistress of the powerful entrepreneur Ernesto Martel (José Luis Gómez) that is her boss and takes care of her terminal father. In the present days, the blind screenwriter Mateo Blanco (Lluís Homar) known by his code name Harry Caine meets a beautiful blonde (Kira Miró) on the street that offers to read the newspaper for him and tells that Ernesto Matel has died. Then his agent Judit García (Blanca Portillo) and her son Diego (Tamar Novas) arrive and Harry promises to end the screenplay that he is writing until the end of the day. Judit leaves the apartment and Harry is visited by a man code named X-Ray (Rubén Ochandiano) that introduces himself as a filmmaker and asks Harry to write the screenplay of his documentary about his intolerant father. Harry recognizes him, refuses the request, sends him away and recalls the year of 1994, when he was casting for his film &quot;Chicas Y Maletas&quot; and met Lena. Sooner they fall in love for each other and Ernesto Martel, who was the producer, sends his homosexual son to prepare the behind scene and making off of the movie. With the support of a reader of lips, the jealous and obsessive Martel daily falls each step of Lena with tragic consequences for the couple of lovers.\n\n&quot;Los Abrazos Partidos&quot; is another magnificent film of the talented Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, who is among my favorite contemporary directors. The plot has a complex, but perfect screenplay with use of flashbacks with a marvelous development of the characters. Lluís Homar performs the lead character Mateo Blanco a.k.a. Harry Caine (a pun with hurricane) that uses two alternate names of Pedro Almodóvar and has a great performance. His erotic scene with the unknown and extremely gorgeous Kira Miró is astonishing. Penélope Cruz is stunning and has another top-notch performance directed by Almodóvar. The open conclusion is ironic after the remark of Mateo Blanco about &quot;Chicas Y Maletas&quot; and I liked it. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Abraços Partidos&quot; (&quot;Broken Hugs&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "For those of us who might have been disappointed by some of the most recent Loach movies (Land and Freedom, Carla&apos;s song...), &quot;The flickering flame&quot;, a TV documentary, shows Loach at his most powerful. The film documents the recent Liverpool docker&apos;s strike, where many workers lost their jobs for refusing to go against their own beliefs by crossing a picket line. The film is a great example of a successful political documentary. Loach manages to put across many political points without once being overly demonstrative or heavy. On the contrary, issues such as the betrayal of the workers by their bureaucratic union bosses are plainly and forcefully shown.\n\nAs well as being a great political film, publicizing the struggle of the Liverpool dockers, &quot;The flickering flame&quot; can be seen as a comment on the condition of the working-class in Britain, or even throughout &quot;liberal&quot; Europe. The film shows British society&apos;s shift to the right and documents the taking away of rights that had been bitterly fought for in the past. Above all, the film shows the dignity of the Liverpool dockers and of their wives. It&apos;s a deeply human film that shows how workers who had given their lives to their jobs were unfairly dismissed simply for sticking to their beliefs. One of the best &quot;militant&quot; films of all time.",

I think this is a form of, so I don&apos;t know a better word and so I will call it Preporn - for us today, it looks very crazy.\n\nThe film is coloured and the pictures are really nice and beautiful. Also the actors are pretty good. The UfA-Star Heli Finkenzeller an her husband Will Dohm are really believable and funny. But also Richard Häussler is a good actor , with an diabolic taste, like Ferdinand Marian in &quot;Münchhausen&quot;.\n\nBut the story about a woman who wants to bath and the hole village is staring at her is so silly!!! You have to think the hole time that this film is a joke, if you don&apos;t think so, you will become mad.\n\nSo, I give it a 6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Around the time Chevy Chase had hit it big with Saturday night live, he started to get movie offers. So after sharing the screen with Goldie Hawn in &quot;Foul Play&quot;, we who would see Chase voicing the thoughts of everyone&apos;s favourite show-time pooch at the time; the lovable Benji. &quot;Oh Heavenly Dog&quot; is a comedy murder mystery that sees Chase as a washed-up detective that&apos;s murdered and then is sent back down to earth in the form of a dog to uncover who killed him. So would you class it as a Chase vehicle? Not really. Would he go far for being in it. Probably not. However the dry humour and the presence of Benji (who&apos;s quite well-trained and steals nearly every scene) just fitted snugly with Chase. Maybe minor, but passable. The story plays out like a lively comic strip, where it&apos;s all about investigating the clues from a dog&apos;s point of view and also getting into mishaps within a London / Paris backdrop. Quite foreseeable plotting, but nonetheless amusingly undemanding. Along the way the lovely Jane Seymour finds herself caught-up in the web and Omar Sharif is at his seedy best in trying to cover everything up. The cast kind of keeps a straight-face throughout. Also the buoyant sounding music soundtrack is an odd assortment of choices. Perhaps better remembered for nostalgic reasons, but &quot;Oh Heavenly Dog&quot; is an admirable little comedy fantasy.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, to set the record straight once &amp; for all,Andy Warhol intended this film,as well as the rest of his early cinematic efforts not to be viewed as standard cinema (at least in the traditional sense). Films such as Kiss,Empire,Sleep &amp; others like it were an extension of still photography (just undertaken on a much larger scale). All of Warhol&apos;s films from 1963,until 1968 were shot in 16mm (as it was much cheaper than filming in 35mm,and could be screened at venues specializing in that medium). If you must insist on Warhol&apos;s early films to be viewed as cinema,I would say that they would be a splendid cure for insomnia or narcolepsy (a few years ago,there was a Warhol retrospective at the Wadsworth Athenuem in Hartford,Ct.,and some select Warhol films were screened in the Athenuem&apos;s in house cinema...and yes....I did see half an hour of &apos;Sleep&apos;,his first film featuring avant/garde poet, John Giorno living up to the films title...sleeping for five and a half hours). The truth be known, I prefer his later films, such as Chelsea Girls (1966),Poor Little Rich Girl (1965),and the rarely seen Inner And Outer Space (also from 1965). By the way,for anyone who hasn&apos;t seen &apos;Kiss&apos;,it&apos;s little more than a series of portraits of various Warhol hanger on&apos;s, kissing for three minutes at a time (the short films were later collected on one or two reels,clocking in at just under an hour,filmed silent,but a music score was actually composed to accompany the films by John Cale---a soundtrack CD does exist).",

And to have the ability to mix the lightness (especiall in the way many scenes are staged and shot) with the philosophical question it raises is just plain great. It might not be your cup of tea or you might think that some people are reading things into the movie that aren&apos;t there. But seeing a trailer for another movie done by this director, I am pretty sure, that those things are meant to be there.\n\nNevertheless, it doesn&apos;t make this movie flawless. And quite a few people will dislike it. But as with many movies, you should be able to tell, if you like the (visual) style and tone of the movie, when it reaches the ten minute mark. If it didn&apos;t convince you by then, you could stop watching, because it won&apos;t have any different effect by the end of it. On the other hand, if you are &quot;captured&quot; (no pun intended) into the world, you will have a truly great experience watching this movie.",

And yes, you will probably enjoy it more if you liked the original series in the 90s.\n\nBut still. It&apos;s a really funny movie and the budget was huge for a Swedish movie at that time. Bill Skarsgård was just a kid and i really funny to se him at the beginning of his career. So it&apos;s not only &quot;Kenny Begins&quot; it&apos;s allso a little Bill Begins. This movies still makes me laugh several times a year. Love it!",

Tom McCamus is a very talented actor, and in a few weeks of hanging around on the internet with Tom McCamus fans, it&apos;s hard not to become one yourself. So, I&apos;m game. \n\nThey say that this is the movie that got Tom McCamus his role as Mason Eckhart in Mutant X. Tom McCamus plays Dr. Clerval. According to me a mixture of Adam Kane (because of his arrogance) and Mason Eckhart (just.. the voice, the glare, the movements... wow).\n\nThe lightning is great, the acting is magnificent, especially by Tom McCamus. That man can do a lot with just one look or the tone of his voice. The 2 other actors, Lucy Akhurst and Stephen Moyer are so and so. Stephen Moyer&apos;s character is just... annoying and Lucy Akhurst plays the role of the tormented and lost Schiller well. The soundtrack is neat, and the movie shows that you can do a lot with one subject only. \n\nIt got me on the edge of my seat all the time. I loved it.\n\nThe weird thing is that the movie hasn&apos;t been released on DVD overseas, but in a small country like Holland (and Belgium). (Come on Fireworks! Release it already the proper way!)",

Both have Wim Wenders exploring Japan, though Tokyo-Ga is a documentary, and one with a surprising focus on Yasujiro Ozu. When Wenders is focused on Ozu, and interviewing people who knew the legendary filmmaker, I think Tokyo-Ga is at its best.\n\nThere are other sections dedicated to just exploring technology and life in Japan, but these parts come up a little short at times. Wenders&apos; narration can feel a little surface-level at times, or at least not as exceptional as Werner Herzog&apos;s would be, if he handled a film like this (he does have a cameo appearance here though, which was cool).\n\nIt&apos;s a pretty good watch. It doesn&apos;t do for the documentary genre what Perfect Days does for non-documentary films, by any means, but it&apos;s still fairly good for what it is, and was relatively interesting to me throughout.",

That&apos;s okay with me though, I still watch it every time I catch it on cable. It&apos;s definitely a &quot;so bad, it&apos;s good&quot; movie. Ralph Macchio isn&apos;t a great actor, but Robin Lively was terrible in her role as the supposed love-interest...which only made it better in my eyes. The dialogue was corny, over-the-top, and oh-so unnatural. Brilliant!\n\nI sincerely liked the first KK, was bored by the second one, but KK III is definitely my favorite. It&apos;s poorly-made, poorly-acted, and poorly-written. And I loved every minute of it."

Most kids movies have some type of obstacle for the main character to overcome and then they come out on top. Sammy encounters more obstacles than most. The majority of this movie is just one sad, scary thing happening after another (difficult for some children to deal with). I thought the graphics were great even though I didn&apos;t watch the 3D version. I think the movie was okay, but it dragged quite a bit. It&apos;s not one of those movies that my child will want to watch again and again and again. If you&apos;re looking for a completely light and happy children&apos;s movie to watch you may want to look elsewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "**SPOILERS** Surviving from what happened in the wild party of the night before at comedy legend Jolly Grimm ,James Coco, mansion writer Jimmy Morrison, David Dukes, is laid up in his hospital bed recovering from a bullet wound in his neck. Jimmy is doing what he does best writing a screenplay about the terrible events that put him in the hospital and ended up taking the lives of two people, one a major screen heart-throb, at the party.\n\nIt all started when comedian Jolly Grimm who hadn&apos;t made a movie in years invited all the Hollywood big shot producers and a number of actors actresses, and hangers on, to his place to view his new film &quot;Brother Jasper&quot; that he hoped will re-start his fledgling career. Having had an amazing 27 hits in a row Grimm is now considered a has-been by the studios and hasn&apos;t been giving any staring parts in any of their major motion pictures. Grimm decided to go over their heads and make a movie that he stares in and and directed himself. Grimm still needs the Hollywood honchos to distribute his movie for it to reach the public and it&apos;s at the party that Grimm is throwing that he hopes to impress them in just doing that. \n\nTense and nervous the day before the big party Grimm takes it out on his live-in girlfriend Queenie, Requal Welch, who put up with his manic-depressive actions for years but now it seems that even she reached her breaking point with Grimm unable, or not wanting, to control his violent outbursts anymore that she&apos;s at the receiving end.\n\nShowing Jimmy the movie &quot;Brother Jasper&quot; to get his professional opinion Grimm&apos;s told that the movie needs a number of changes or cuts, like a comedic cannibal scene,in what&apos;s supposed to be a heart-wrenching and serious film, that has poor Jimmy almost thrown out of the Grimm Mansion. With all the Hollywood illuminates showing up to see what Grimm hoped to be his masterpiece and the movie that would catapult him back on top of the weekly theater ticket receipts, and on the silver screen, things don&apos;t go as well as Grimm hoped in fact the party turns out to be a total and deadly disaster for him.\n\nLoosely based on an incident about actor Fatty Arbuckle back in the 1920&apos;s when he was arrested and put on trial for the rape and murder of a young starlet that he invited to a drunken party, and orgy, of his. Arbuckle was found innocent but his career was finished and he died a poor and broken man some ten years later.\n\nJames Coco is at his best as the tragic Jolly Grimm who ends up not only losing any chance of getting back in the Hollywood limelight but also looses Queenie first to movie matinée idol Dale Sword, Perry King, and then ends up losing her life due to his jealous and uncountable rage. Grimm is not at all that much of a villain in the film &quot;The Wild Party&quot; he&apos;s more a victim of his own spectacular success.\n\nSweet and loving at first when he took Queenie off the street and gave her a place to stay, in his, mansion and put her in a number of his movies as well, as taking care off all her needs Grimm also treated Queenie as an equal not as someone who&apos;s totally dependent on him. It was only when his career started to fall apart that Grimm became an abusive swine towards her as well as everyone else. \n\nWith the party degenerating into an orgy free for all and Queenie leaving Grimm, by going off with Dale Sword, all by himself that the drinks and suspicions that were overwhelming his already fragile mind took control and Grimm lost it as well as lost what life and freedom that he still had left.",

      "reviewBody": "You Better Watch Out otherwise known as Christmas Evil is essentially a Christmas version of Falling Down (1993) just not as clever, interesting, thought provoking or even remotely good.\n\nIt tells the story of a man tormented by the memory of discovering that Santa Claus isn&apos;t real. Overworked and underappreciated, taken advantage by work colleagues and witnessing the selfishness of his company he finally snaps and goes on a killing spree dressed as santa (As you do).\n\nIt&apos;s one of those films where though you can&apos;t fully empathise with the antagonist you can understand his plight to an extent and even feel a little bit sorry for him. Arguably a tale of mental illness it certainly has a passable premise but the execution is more than a little shoddy.\n\nIf you take it for what it is you may find a level of enjoyment, but nothing is likely to prepare you for the more than a little odd finale.\n\nThe Good:\n\nI get what they were trying to do\n\nThe Bad:\n\nDelivery is lacking\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nI&apos;m unsure whether that ending constitutes as good or bad",

      "reviewBody": "This movie comes from a seasoned director who, in the same year, nonetheless, shot another movie which i would consider the best film of 2001.   This one, also shot on digital cameras takes place in a dingy hotel room and contains a cast of, count &apos;em, 1,2, THREE people, who are never seen outside of the context of the dingy motel room.  So, don&apos;t expect for the scene to change.  This film, based on a play, strives on realism, hence no orchestral score, no unnecessary settings or extra characters, just three fantastic actors dealing with issues.  One (Hawke) is a volunteer firefighter/ drug dealer who likes to, ahem, get excessively high off his own supply.  Another is his high school buddy,a budding young director whose film is being screen in the Lansing, Michigan Film festival, whose apparent maturity and superiority over his drug-binging pal and confidente is deceptive.  The final character, who arrives 2/3 of the way through the movie is a former high school crush/ associate district attorney  with significantly surrogate emotional ties to both of the men.\n\n The riveting conversations that evolve from somewhat sneeringly nostalgic to downright inhospitable fluidly move the film more actively than any number of action-packed popcorn flicks out there.  In fact, you&apos;ll have no trouble getting over the fact that you&apos;re just watching 3 people talking in a room for 2 hours (I&apos;ll admit that that was a little intimidating at first).  The film successfully lures us in with that inherent voyeurism that brought those first moviegoers into the transformed vaudeville theaters.  As a passive observer, we become immersed in exactly that which should be none of our business, just like Hawke&apos;s character pulls himself into a situation that is none of his business.  By the end, no clear resolution is reached and as compelling and intriguing as it all was, we feel guilty for looking through the peephole.",

I am disappointed with the genre because of this film.\n\nNo plot, annoyingly hollow characters that never develop, horrible actors, and a poor concept from the beginning make this movie (and it&apos;s twin) worthless. Quite literally, Mother Goose&apos;s simplest tale has miles more to say about the world. While such a feat used to be hard for this genre, now it seems 9 year olds get novels published, and screenplays filmed.\n\nIt gets a second star simply for being so easy to heckle. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 version is more enjoyable, and illustrates my point beautifully. However, this episode is a little wasted if you don&apos;t watch with friends and heckle along too.",

      "reviewBody": "Guns of the Magnificent Seven is by far the best of the sequels to the classic original.  The cast is definitely the second best in terms of &quot;up and coming&quot; actors at that time, and viewers will probably recognize most of them.  The plot of this one has Chris (George Kennedy) and a new gang being hired to free a Mexican revolutionary from a prison known as &quot;The Rat Hole&quot;. Of course, the prison is run by a highly ruthless colonel, who frowns on dissidents, and tortures and kills for pleasure.\n\nThe gang here is an eclectic bunch, each with their own specialty. Although considering more than half the gang gets wiped out in every film, it&apos;s beyond me why anyone would still be crazy or desperate enough to join!  I guess news doesn&apos;t travel over the border much.  It&apos;s a shame that Yul Brynner didn&apos;t do this one (no insult to Kennedy), as it seems more dimension has been added to this character than we&apos;ve seen before.  The character of Keno (Monte Markham) is suspiciously similar to Vin from the previous two movies, but the rest of the gang are wholly original for the series: there&apos;s a black explosives expert; a one-armed sharp shooter (who happens to be a Civil War veteran - think of the word play between these two!); an old, fatherly-figure knife thrower; and finally a quiet rope expert who seems to have either cancer or tuberculosis.\n\nWhat the film lacks in originality is made up for by the characters (and the actors who play them), great action, music and cinematography.  The climactic action scene is definitely the second best of the series (although a couple of the gang die way too soon), and the movie moves along at a faster pace then the previous entries.  Another interesting note on this entry is that there are parallels within the story to what was happening in the real world at the time of it&apos;s release.  Racial prejudice, talk of revolution, overly harsh and abusive authority figures, etc.  I don&apos;t believe any of the other entries touched on modern themes so directly. Yet they don&apos;t date the film, and are surprisingly still relevant today.\n\nA couple small complaints: when did Chris&apos;s &quot;price&quot; go up to $600 a job??? It was only $100 in the first film and I can&apos;t imagine inflation rose that high in a few short years!  Although each member is seemingly recruited for their individual expertise, there&apos;s no evidence showing any of these skills being used, except as an occasional afterthought.  Strangest of all is when Chris says something in Spanish at the end, prompting one of the Mexican children to ask `What did he say?&apos;.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just me, but why wouldn&apos;t a child of about 10 understand what was said in his own language?\n\n While the overall execution of this film is standard as both a western and entry in this franchise, it still holds up better than the other two sequels, the earlier &quot;Return of the Seven&quot; and later &quot;The Magnificent Seven Ride&quot;.  Fans of the `Seven&apos; series, or westerns in general, should find enough excitement here to hold their interest.  Just don&apos;t go looking for a masterpiece, and accept it as one of the few decent sequels churned out by Hollywood.\n\n**1/2 out of ****",

I&apos;m not sure why it doesn&apos;t get the love of the later films. Maybe it&apos;s because it&apos;s a relatively laid-back affair with a breezy sense of humor that never really sinks into toilet jokes or smutty double entendres.\n\nSome say that Sid and Kenneth are underused - my opinion is that they&apos;re like a dash of cayenne pepper in the mix. A little dab&apos;ll do ya! I miss Charles Hawtrey but Lance Percival is hilarious. The color works well and the sets are very elaborate, especially the shot when the camera pans down into the ship&apos;s swimming pool. I showed this one to my girlfriend (who generally doesn&apos;t like older movies) and she was laughing out loud the whole time.\n\nThere seems to be a minority who rate this entry highly. For my money this one&apos;s better than Cleo and Cowboy...maybe not as good as Screaming. Just my 2 cents.",

The Polish brothers (director, writers) achieve that state possibly because the modest $13 million budget is still much more than they ever had and their approach is too reverential to the hero, who by any standards pursues a quixotic goal of launching himself at the risk of jettisoning his family and close friends.\n\nCharles Farmer (Billie Bob Thornton) is determined to achieve his goal in the face of losing his too well ordered and clean farm and his loving, dutiful, and way too accepting wife, Audrey (Virginia Madsen). Thornton, underplaying with that fetching drawl and highly-developed outsider persona, does a credible job of dreaming his impossible dream without appearing unstable or psychotic. Madsen, while always attractive, has such a clichéd part as the long-suffering mate that the character could appear to be even more unrealistic than her husband.\n\nThe two young daughters mug for the camera or make too much happy to be credible. Only two characters ring true all the time: Farmer&apos;s son, Shephard (Max Thierot), who is cool as a teen mission controller; and an uncredited Bruce Willis, who plays an ex-astronaut friend of Farmer trying to talk him out of a potentially disastrous launch. Everyone else is a caricature, as the film itself is almost a parody of the American dream: It relies on the American tradition of individualism, evenat the expense of those closest to the dreamer. That&apos;s an American tragedy."

He also more clearly outlined why we should pay more attention to the EV, and how it played such a key role in the history of our country.\n\nThe main thrust of this movie is to educate the public about the actions of key players in shaping our society through their policies on transportation and energy, and how powerful those policies have proved to be in affecting us as a nation. I came away with a better understanding of what I had only guessed at before, and I am very glad that Mr. Paine chose to give the concern-inspiring events first but leave us with a sense of optimism for the future.\n\nThe only fault I can find with this movie is that it necessarily has to cover a lot of factual information, something that makes it a lot like reading a good book, rather than viewing a movie. But, if it makes you take a good look at why we&apos;re paying over $3/gallon for gas, then it&apos;s a good book indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; is a film with a bit of controversy. The story clearly was based on the experiences of US Air Force pilot Scott O&apos;Grady...but they took great liberties with the facts and O&apos;Grady felt he was maligned by the movie because the lead (Owen Wilson) had a lousy attitude at the beginning of the film and was insubordinate...unlike the real life O&apos;Grady. The film also changes a lot of the facts--making the plane a two-seat Navy plane (an F-18 Super Eagle) flown from an aircraft carrier instead of the single seat F-16 O&apos;Grady flew from an air base. Regardless, the film still is quite exciting and worth seeing.\n\nThe story begins on a US aircraft carrier. Lt. Burnett (Wilson) is annoyed flying during the 1995 cease fire over what was Yugoslavia, as they are simply flying reconnaissance missions...and avoiding combat with the Bosnians. After submitting his request for discharge from the Navy, the Admiral (Gene Hackman) chews Burnett out and assigns him extra duty...in this case, a recon mission on Christmas.\n\nUnfortunately, the two-seat plane is shot down by Serbs...a violation of the cease fire. After both the pilot and navigator eject, the Serbs execute the pilot...and the navigator, Burnett, manages to escape and the rest of the film concerns the Serbs trying to kill Burnett because of the information he&apos;s gained from the mission about troop movements and genocide. To avoid death, Burnett runs many miles over hostile territory to safety.\n\nAs I watched the film, it became clear that the film was intended thrill audiences at the expense of common sense....especially at the end of the picture. Seeing the Admiral flying a helicopter on the rescue mission seemed pretty dopey and the US Navy would never risk a command officer on such a mission. There also were some stunts at the end which were pretty dim as well. Exciting? Yes....but at the expense of realism. In reality, helicopters AND Marine fighter planes were involved in the mission (the film onlys showed helicopters, which seemed silly flying into such hostile territory when they DID have an aircraft carrier filled with planes!).\n\nOh, and while it&apos;s not terribly important, the film takes place over Christmas and O&apos;Grady&apos;s plane was actually shot down around June.\n\nOverall, a fun film to watch but do NOT take it to be a history lesson.",

The best thing about this movie is Isaac Hayes playing the chef, just like he did on South Park before he got all the wacky Scientology crap in his head. I could have done without the Sopranos &quot;jokes&quot;. For a series that took pride in the silly ways that people got killed, they really dropped the ball in this one. The first death is an exact copy of the first death in the first movie. Weak. The rest just didn&apos;t seem like they would kill a person.What really sucked is that it was immediately obvious that the sheriff was either Jamie Kennedy or a woman, it was the worst disguise ever. Did I mention all the bad acting and things that don&apos;t make sense? Several times one of the guys says &quot;Angela&apos;s back!&quot;. How can she be back if she was never at this camp? Just like any other part four, the only reason to watch this is if you have seen the first three.",

I&apos;ll take a wild guess and assume that viewer is not from these parts of the world, if he is, he would know that translating Zona on English is practically impossible. People who done it should get credit just for doing it. The dialect used in a movie is very old, and unfortunately almost forgotten.\n\n As for the movie I found it very entertaining. I read a book a long time ago and I remembered thinking that it was a beautiful story. Actors are good, but like in all movies they can be better. Considering that most of the casting is very young, including two major roles, they have done an excellent job.\n\nDirector put him self to the limit trying to make it authentic as much as possible and I personally think that he has done a very good job. I know some people from the town of Nis (city where everything happened), and they told me that they liked the movie. That&apos;s good enough for me.\n\nI strongly recommend, don&apos;t miss this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a collection of three films, all student films I think, each with their own opening and closing credits. The title Terrifying Tales has been added to the beginning, and there are no end credits for the whole.\n\nThe first segment starts off pretty well. It&apos;s night, and a young woman kisses a younger boy who is sleeping, possibly her brother. She looks at a photo of a man in uniform. She sneaks away as a bug exterminator&apos;s van pulls up, and then the next morning as she enters a roadside diner she sees the van again. She enlists the help of a man playing pool to get away from the van her father is driving. He puts on his jacket that has a NASA patch on it, and they speed off in his station wagon. He remains completely silent, and he drives recklessly fast. In summarizing, I&apos;ll jump to the end. Given that he has a NASA patch, and the title is &quot;10 Seconds to Countdown,&quot; it will come as no surprise that they wind up in a spaceship. More surprising that there is a dying, crying primate of some kind in there. I confess I have no idea what was going on in the ending scene or what to make of the ending. This segment was copyright 1986.\n\nIn the second segment &quot;Final Destination: Unknown,&quot; a woman picks up a male hitchhiker, who strangles her. He accepts a ride from a man, and is invited to his house for chili. The man puts some men&apos;s headshot photos into a file near his computer. He calls his daughter down for chili, and we think: oh no, maybe no one will come to dinner, for could the hitchhiker have killed his daughter? Well - yes and no, because his daughter does come down for dinner. The ending is pretty predictable. This one wasn&apos;t too bad. Copyright 1989.\n\nIn the last segment, two men show up at what is evidently a crime scene. They pick up a bloody knife in an alley and seem to put it back down. They enter a room and look around, and wake up a woman there. One of the men leaves, the other stays and wants to help the hooker he woke up. She had witnessed the murder, or the murdered person was or roommate, or perhaps there was no murder at all. The man who stays, the coroner, even stays the night, and a perhaps retarded man, possibly one-armed man, named Charlie enters talking about potatoes. The coroner thinks Charlie did the murder, and meanwhile by staying with the hooker, the coroner&apos;s wife is getting upset. Charlie is possibly AWOL, though what the military would be doing with him in its ranks, I can&apos;t imagine. I don&apos;t think the murder (if there was one?) is solved at the end, but there is an autopsy to do. Can&apos;t say I understood this one either. Copyright 1986, though it looked much older to me.",

And that can only be a testament of the novels they were based on - which obviously I haven&apos;t read - shame on me.\n\nIt is nice to see the usual suspect reprise their leading roles, but also have some other known German (and other European) actors being added here. I just realize that I never talked about the &quot;native American&quot; language that they use in these movies ... I have no idea on what that is based on ... but it does not sound as if they are mocking the people speaking them. Generally speaking you can feel that there is love for the native Americans. It is nice to see a morally &quot;right&quot; view on things ... or at least a not one sided &quot;white man&quot; approach and outlook on them.",

      "reviewBody": "I was recommended to see this movie. I didn&apos;t know that this movie was the Brazilian choice for the Oscars for Best Foreign Film and although it wasn&apos;t even nominates is still a very good movie. I say this because it tells a very hard story and it entertains you all the time. The movie relies on a very good direction, photography, music, good dialogs, but as I said what makes the movie likable is that is very entertaining and catches you in every moment, from the beginning to the end. Besides the acting is really good and realist, which is another strong point for the movie. Although there&apos;s no hero in this movie the characters are kind of lovable. One thing that I didn&apos;t fully understood is why do they present the two kids in the beginning if they are going to tell with more importance the story of only one of them, I understand that is for knowing their past and it helps to understand a lot, but one of the boys doesn&apos;t get the same importance of the other. And tough in the end, in the part of the bus assault there are some things rushed and that doesn&apos;t fit well, it&apos;s very good and engaging. I don&apos;t know what else to say, it is simply a very good movie that tells the life story of two children from the favelas of Rio De Janeiro and it&apos;s very good to see good stories about this subjects."

      "reviewBody": "Expectations were very high for &apos;Mary Poppins Returns&apos;. &apos;Mary Poppins&apos; is still one of my all-time favourite films, the very meaning of a timeless classic. The cast is also a very talented one and have enjoyed some of Disney&apos;s previous re-makes/follow-ups. After watching the trailer, &apos;Mary Poppins Returns&apos; did become one of my most anticipated films of 2018 and was really hoping it would be as good as the trailer was and not be a disappointment, where the trailer was great and the film was not, like another highly anticipated film &apos;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&apos;.\n\nFound myself luckily really enjoying this on the most part after seeing it with my sister. It is not in the same league as, or have the same amount of magic as, &apos;Mary Poppins&apos;, which would have been a tall order in the first place with such enormously high quality to love up to. But on its own merits there were for me a lot of merits and a lot to enjoy for all ages, young and old, male and female. &apos;Mary Poppins Returns&apos; is imperfect and the magic is not quite there all the way through, but for me the film was not devoid of it and there is a great deal of charm, not a cash grab.\n\nThere is not an awful lot of originality to the story, really did appreciate that it tried to be respectful, which is obvious in the numerous nods throughout the film. But structurally there was a sense of over-faithfulness and that it could have felt more like its own story. There were a few draggy stretches and scenes that felt like filler, especially the rather strange and not really needed in hindsight scene with Meryl Streep.\n\nReally like Streep but she and her character were just bizarre and she overdoes the acting, with the character feeling like a going nowhere plot-device practically forgotten about quickly. Confess too to guessing early on everything with the shares.\n\nHowever, &apos;Mary Poppins Returns&apos; benefits hugely from looking absolutely wonderful, beautifully shot and with gorgeous nostalgic colours in the production and costume designs that fondly recall &apos;Mary Poppins&apos;. The animation in the animated sequence shows technological advancement and how a lot of effort was made to show respect to &apos;Mary Poppins&apos;. Another huge plus is Emily Blunt (closer to PL Travers&apos; vision of Mary Poppins), who is superb and the asset that comes closest to being practically perfect in every way. She is well supported by Lin Manuel Miranda, sporting a not so great accent but immense energy, likeability, charm and a great singing voice (they work wonderfully together too, most obvious in &quot;A Cover is Not the Book&quot;). As well as appealing beyond their years performances from the children (evident in the tense climactic moments of the animated scene), movingly stoic Ben Whishaw and charming Emily Mortimer. Colin Firth is fun, and in the animated sequence his voice work was the standout, Julie Walters is even more of a hoot, and really loved the Dick Van Dyke and Angela Lansbury cameos and a hilariously crusty David Warner. Only Streep didn&apos;t work for me.\n\nA lot has been said about the inferiority of the songs. Will say that they are nowhere near the same quality of those in &apos;Mary Poppins&apos; and are unlikely to become songbook standards. In their own way though, to me they were very pleasant and well composed, the best being &quot;Can You Imagine That&quot; and &quot;Nowhere to Go But Up&quot;, both actually very hummable, and the one miss being the completely forgettable and pointless &quot;Turning Turtle&quot;. They were also very well staged, neither overblown or static, the standouts being &quot;Nowhere to Go But Up&quot; and &quot;A Cover is Not the Book&quot; (didn&apos;t actually find the latter long winded). That for &quot;Can You Imagine That&quot; was very colourful and had immense charm. A highlight too was the Doulton bowl/vaudevillian animated sequence, loved the animation itself and it was just very entertaining and charming with a tense end. Most of the film left me completely gripped, the script had drollness and heart (with some funny moments) and there was an investable emotional impact with the Banks&apos; story without it being cloying. It was hard not to squeal and shed a small tear at the affectionate and nostalgic nods to &apos;Mary Poppins&apos; peppered throughout the film. This was clearly made by people who loved, or at least had great affection for, &apos;Mary Poppins&apos;, not intent on tarnishing it. It&apos;s directed with a loving hand by Rob Marshall and the instrumental score is lush and whimsical.\n\nSo all in all, as said, not practically perfect in every way but the magic almost returns. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": ".... this was supposed to be a &quot;true&quot; story, so why not tell it as it really happened? Of course, there are always budget restraints and other considerations that come into play. But I can never quite work out why Hollywood changes crucial facts of a real story when making &quot;true-life&quot; movies of this type. Don&apos;t get me wrong - I saw this movie for the first time just last week, a full 13 years after it first appeared, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It didn&apos;t glorify war at all, and some of the scenes were quite shocking and moving. However, having read the TRUE story of BAT 21 some years ago, I couldn&apos;t help thinking &quot;hang on a minute - it didn&apos;t happen like that!!!&quot; In reality, the actual 1972 mission to rescue Lt. Col. Hambleton was a very complex affair that lasted for 12 days, the downed airman finally being rescued by a two-man team consisting of a US Navy SEAL lieutenant (who won the Medal Of Honour in the process) and a South Vietnamese Army Ranger. Why not include this in the movie if you&apos;re out to tell anything like the true story? Also, several US aircraft and choppers were shot down in the process, with 10 American airmen killed and two more captured. But apart from the superbly done abortive helicopter rescue attempt and the shooting of the captured crewmen, the movie led us to believe that the rescue mission merely consisted of Hambleton (Hackman) escaping &amp; evading on the ground with Clark (Danny Glover) circling above and talking to him on the radio. In reality, Clark was himself shot down early in the mission and had to be rescued, and his role in the actual Hambleton rescue was therefore nothing like that depicted in the film.\n\nBut, that said, why let the truth get in the way of a good story? And despite its shortcomings on the historical accuracy front, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film that didn&apos;t gloss over or sanitize the horrors of war. Despite my nit-picking, I&apos;d definitely recommend it."

The amazing photography with the bears, the stunning cinematography overall and the great landscape (British Columbia) all make this a visual treat. Even better, it&apos;s an interesting story and has remained that with each of the viewings I&apos;ve had of this film since discovering it in the mid &apos;90s.\n\nIt&apos;s a solid adventure story, and the little bear in here is lovable. The &quot;bad guys&quot; (the hunters) aren&apos;t really all that bad, either. The bears&apos; performances are fascinating, simply amazing. It must have taken incredible patience to film this movie.\n\nOutside of a couple of &quot;damns,&quot; there is no profanity and, I would think, is a great film for any age person to see. Highly recommended.",

Not only is he a run away groom, he had many underworld connection, that has gangs and yakuzas hot on his trail. All converge in Tokyo and mayhem ensues.\n\nThe visuals (on DVD) is very good, and although the story was bit silly, it had enough impact to be entertaining. If there was one thing I didn&apos;t like was Kelly Chan&apos;s acting. She always appears wooden and fails to bring the voltage up on the story. They&apos;ve also failed to cash in on the talent of Japanese actors, and couldn&apos;t make a good story around them. Hiroshi Abe should have been the lead role on the Japanese side, and should have been pit against Tony Lueng Chiu Wai. Then the story and the movie would have been 200% better.\n\nSo it&apos;s a movie that needs little more work, and some change in the actors, but overall it was an acceptable action drama."

Which is something I do not say lightly, when it comes to German movies ... many times I feel that actors are more like parrots and unable to convey their feelings ... but let&apos;s stick to this movie and how good the actors are.\n\nThe pacing may be slow - but if you like intriguing and thought provoking stories ... well you could do a lot worse.

It can&apos;t really be said to boast an A-list cast, though Telly Savalas arguably dominates most scenes as the sadistic Dagineau. This time the ostensible lead Guy Stockwell, gets to play a much more personable and loyal brother than the one he plays in his earlier War Lord, where his screen brother is the regularly heroic Charlton Heston. \n\nWhat impressed me was how good the film looks and how convincing a substitute Arizona and a Universal backlot is for the Sahara. Sorry, but after appreciating the vivid technicolours in this film, I don&apos;t think anyone could convince me (as many of the other reviewers here try to do so), that the earlier black and white versions (with the 1926 version being silent for goodness sake) are more enjoyable watching. The other thing that I found unexpectedly good were the handling of the battle scenes primarily in the second half of the film. For a 1966 movie, they are quite realistic, suspenseful and intense, with some liberally spilt blood thrown in for good measure.\n\nYour time won&apos;t be wasted spending a couple of hours with Beau Geste.",

      "reviewBody": "50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler&apos;s last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn&apos;t very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there&apos;s also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy.",

From the picturesque shots to the red fades to the stinger notes, it&apos;s easy to appreciate this production. The delicate, deliberate pace may turn off some viewers but the dream-like atmosphere easily held my attention, not to mention the three beautiful female leads. The bizarre ending (before the epilogue) was unexpected and indeed provided a wonderfully macabre and memorable image. Daughters of Darkness succeeds at what Vampyros Lesbos attempted to be. Just make sure to watch the full version.",

Let&apos;s even forget Mikhalkov is not overly modest. But, if you dare to touch such important subject before the 65th anniversary of the Great Victory and declare your product &quot;Great&quot;, it must be great.\n\nAnd what we see? All the movie is full of stupidity, Mikhalkov&apos;s fantasy and himself. Several separate novels (bad plots). About what? Who knows! There are good Nazi military men and bad soviet civil men and women. Stupid soviet people force Nazis to bomb Russian Red Cross ship, or, for variety&apos;s sake, burn 100 or 500 peasants. Nazies even cry when they are forced to do so! And only Mikhalkov&apos;s Kotov does the right things. He is everywhere. He - but not any sense. There is no need for the voluminous review to summarize, Utomlyonnye solntsem 2 are: nazi ass, trying to defecate down from 400 km/h plan, and &quot;show me your tits&quot;. Great...\n\nBTW, &quot;burnt&quot; may sound better for English-speakers, but the right translation is &quot;Tired by the sun&quot; - not &quot;Burnt...&quot;.

Instead of relying on CGI to enthrall a clueless audience, this movie relies on something rather novel – a real story. Filmed on a budget, this Hammer Film&apos;s special effects are good enough to advance the story. Some IMDb reviewers have criticized the film for its &quot;corny&quot; special effects or its &quot;ridiculous&quot; story. They simply don&apos;t appreciate the movie&apos;s effects in their context. Further, I would disagree that the story is ridiculous. The story unfolds as the characters and viewers discover the secret in Hobbs End. If you don&apos;t know what the movie is about, you will enjoy this bit of discovery. Instead of so many contemporary films where the viewer is simply told what happens, as if he or she is slack-jawed imbecile, in Five Million Years to Earth the viewer is part of the discovery process. Finally, the sense of horror builds from a vague sense of unease to a real sense of loathing and fear. I&apos;ve seen this movie at least a half dozen times and continue to enjoy it as much as the first time.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched &quot;Demons of the Mind&quot; after not having seen it since it originally appeared. My memory of the film was very positive, and there are some interesting ideas in the script. However, there are an overabundance of plot elements that are presented in a haphazard and overly hysterical form by director Peter Sykes. One other reviewer here calls this a free-form narrative, but for me it was a confused jumble.\n\nRobert Hardy plays (or overplays, as others here have noted) Count Zorn who is convinced that there is madness and other evil in his family&apos;s bloodline.\n\nHis wife had committed suicide, so he decided that he needed to lock up his children in case they started manifesting any insanity. Years later he has a controversial doctor (played by Patrick Magee in his usual mannered way) treating both grown kids (Shane Briant, Gillian Hills).\n\nAt the same time there are young women being brutally murdered in the woods and local superstitions are being whipped up, while a wandering evangelical (Michael Hordern) mutters religious dogma and joins with the locals.\n\nA good director could have woven all these piece together nicely and provided a solid, disturbing thriller. But Sykes is more interested in whipping up a lot of intensity in each scene, which is why there&apos;s more overacting than needed and why the film winds up becoming exhausting to watch after a while. Too bad. It had the makings of a fine film. Perhaps the usual rushed schedule that Hammer Films had didn&apos;t allow for sufficient care, though screenwriter Christopher Wicking had history of penning horror films that were more interesting in concept than in execution."

They are invited to go to a party in the castle in the weekend and they accept the invitation. Gerard and Marianne go to the party and Marianne vanishes. Gerard asks for help to the local Professor Zimmer (Clifford Evans) and learns that Dr. Ravna is the leader of a vampire cult that had abducted his wife. What will they do?\n\n&quot;The Kiss of the Vampire&quot; is a different but attractive vampire movie where there is no reference to Dracula. The vampires fear the cross and garlic as usual, but they can walk during the cloudy day and can eat and drink wine. Indeed they are a cult led by the notorious Dr. Ravna. The sets and costumes are very beautiful and the vintage car is a piece of art. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Beijo do Vampiro&quot; (&quot;The Kiss of the Vampire)",

(Note- Navy planes were purposely painted in bright colors to facilitate rescue at sea.) \n\nUnfortunately there are a lot of annoying factors to the plot such as Allen Jenkins&apos; alleged comic relief and some pretty unbelievable dialogue. Errol Flynn and Fred MacMurray spend a lot of time on manly stiff-upper-lip dialogue that is unbelievably stilted. There is a lot of real aviation medicine mixed in with some bogus movie baloney (the pressure suit they come up with is kind of a steal from round-the-world pilot Wiley Post). Navy pilots never used anything like that suit or the pressure belt in that time period. The film was actually shot at NAS North Island on Coronado island with the cooperation of the Navy. \n\nIf you want to see the kind of planes the Navy was flying in the late 30&apos;s, though, there is no better film. Look for the Consolidated Coronado 4-engine flying boat in one scene- a flying dinosaur!",

      "reviewBody": "Director Chee Keong Cheung&apos;s strengths and weaknesses as a filmmaker are as evident in Bodyguard: A New Beginning (2008) as they were in his debut Underground (2007). Both are ambitious, ensemble films blending melodrama and martial arts action, as lavishly filmed as their budgets allowed. Cheung clearly has the best eye of all the directors of independent British action films but has yet to master his craft. While the characterisation and plotting are more coherent than in Underground a lack of focus is still apparent. Vincent Sze is ostensibly the lead, but he&apos;s largely silent and fails to make much of an impression. He&apos;s not presented as the next Jet Li as one expects. Instead it is experienced co-star Richard Ng who effortlessly emerges as the real star. Shot partly in Hong Kong and featuring Hollywood villain Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Bodyguard is a distinctive if not wholly successful film that&apos;s well worth seeking out.",

It&apos;s another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky (&quot;Snatch,&quot; &quot;Sexy Beast,&quot; etc.). It&apos;s not wild like &quot;Snatch&quot; but it&apos;s interesting and it has some rough characters.\n\nIt also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it&apos;s about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian &quot;mail order bride&quot; who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.\n\nBen Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman&apos;s Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and well-acted. Kidman once again proves she&apos;s far more than just a beautiful face.",

      "reviewBody": "I went to my local DVD rental store and found this early Kurosawa made just after the end of the World War 2. Curiously this film, &quot;No regrets for my youth&quot; was dubbed in Italian. This was kind of annoying as I like to see the films in their original language, but anyway as I&apos;ve already seen so many films dubbed in English, why not Italian? Well, maybe it was the Italian dubbing, but I couldn&apos;t fail to see the similarity between &quot;No regrets for my youth&quot; and the neorealist films made in Italy just after the war. Coincidence? Anyway, Kurosawa was mainly influenced by the Soviet cinema.\n\n&quot;No regrets for my youth&quot; tells the story of the fight of some students against the militarist regime in Japan and their different destinies throughout the years, but the film focuses mainly on Yukie, that we see in the beginning, just as a spoilt girl, flirting with revolutionary games. She&apos;s very sensitive and soon notices how alienated from reality she is. The military government is slowly tightening its iron grip and silencing the opposition. Idealism has become dangerous in Japan.\n\nYukie now sees what&apos;s happening. She&apos;s very passionate in whatever she does. Yukie makes no compromises, but she&apos;s no fool either. The film will describe her journey - first, the fires of adolescence when the world seems to be out there just to fulfill her wishes, then self-awareness, fight, disillusion, suffering.... She and her friends will arrive to different conclusions and tread different roads.\n\nIn a way, &quot;No regrets for my youth&quot; is a coming of age film, in which politics, emotion and sex play an important role. Yukie wants to find her place in the world. She&apos;s not satisfied with her life and she&apos;s not satisfied with the world in which she&apos;s living. She wants to change them. &quot;No regrets for my youth&quot; shows how she tries to live up to her ideals.\n\nIn &quot;No regrets for my youth&quot; (as I said before) we feel the influence the Soviet (and Italian) masters had on Kurosawa. We see here a young Kurosawa - more spontaneous and enthusiastic (another Kurosawa film, more or less, along the same line is &quot;Stray Dog&quot; that takes place in post-war Japan). The camera is used effectively to show the landscape and people. The acting is more natural. We are spared the exaggerated gestures and movements that are seen in some of his later films. Setsuko Hara who plays Yukie is an extraordinary actress. She helps the film to achieve a truly great emotional depth. Highly recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "At the least, remakes should allow an opportunity to see the differences in film-making from different periods, and, hopefully, to see the advances made in the years bypast; at best, it displays something new and intelligent to a familiar story. The 1913 version of &quot;The Student of Prague&quot; was a film meant to bring respectability to cinema by adapting popular literature; however, the filmmakers lacked an understanding of their own medium and created a, for then, typically static motion picture. Henrik Galeen made this remake during the maturity of one of the greatest periods of national cinema in the history of the art form.\n\nObviously, close-ups and medium shots were common by 1926, where there were none in the aforementioned film of 1913. There&apos;s scene dissection, some inspired cinematography and editing and expressionistic sets by Hermann Warm, as well. We actually get to see the actors here, and Conrad Veidt and Werner Krauss do exceptionally well. The gypsy storyline fits into this version easily.\n\nCinematographers Günther Krampf and Erich Nitzschmann produced a large shadow of the Devil, which interacts with mass, in one shot; superimpose a saw cutting at Balduin&apos;s head in a moment of internal narration; shake the camera for a drunk POV shot; use irises and move the camera during close-ups. The rescue from a horse scene and the haunting finale are the most impressive visually, for the chiaroscuro lighting, special effects and editing. Some shots even seem intentionally reminiscent of the 1913 version. Additionally, the filmmakers were able to punctuate the mirror motif within this film of the doppelgänger thanks to state-of-the-art effects.",

Although not based on the works of Edgar Wallace (or indeed his son Bryan), THE WHITE SPIDER is one of the better entries in the genre, a slightly plodding and plot-focused first half giving way to some memorably madcap hijinks in the second. The villain turns out to be a master of disguise with some very nifty dressing up scenes, and the hero is of a similar ilk which gives this a Holmesian flair. There are also a couple of fine fight scenes which I wasn&apos;t expecting from this genre. A youthful Horst Frank appears.",

This the filmmaker does in a way that the film becomes an exciting introduction, not only to the history of World Cinema, but also to the art and craft of cinema. It shows several films Lumière Brothers had made on the same topic, while varying visual composition or the mise en scene. They obsessively film movement and locomotion of all kinds and experiment with the new medium of the moving images. At one point in the film, we them discovering for themselves, the magic of the mobile camera; and thereafter, many films are about the relationship between the mobile camera and a static world or the moving camera and a moving world. They then, combine the topics of two films in order to make one film with more complex structure. They make actuality films, newsreels, home movies, fiction, and canned plays. They made impressionistic films, as well as closed end narratives. The Lumière Brothers traveled widely and filmed many historical events and ordinary everyday events in many countries of the world. This film is an excellent teaching tool. Young and old, lay, film scholars, and studentsall enjoy this film. This film is a masterpiece and should be revived.",

After a trip to the library, she decides to become a long-lost heiress who disappeared as a child in 1925.\n\nRobert Young plays her ex-boss who looks to expose her lie; Walter Brennan is her welcoming, wealthy father; Ward Bond is his security guy; Dame May Witty the heiress&apos; former nanny. Ray Collins of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; fame also makes an appearance, as does Eugene Palette as the newspaper editor who prints the amnesiac&apos;s story. It&apos;s a terrific cast, with Young&apos;s role being a departure for him. He does it well. Lana is simply adorable.\n\nThe movie leaves an open question, which is kind of fun, too.

You&apos;ll recognize many of the faces here, like Jim Backus and Rip Torn, among others. Apparently the play that this is based on got good reviews, but this movie version is so bad I&apos;m surprised they didn&apos;t stop production and revamp it. On an up note, the movie is an indispensable time capsule. With JFK&apos;s assassination and the Beatles, this early 60&apos;s world would soon change forever. It&apos;s also worth seeing for the tiny Soupy Sales cameo.",

Nothing can compare to what this film provides to the bodily senses and imaginative capacity it expands within the blessed soul.\n\nIf I could give this more than perfect, I would rate it as infinite. I invite you to watch this film, you too will witness heaven and beyond.",

      "reviewBody": "I had seen that excellent movie in a cinema festival in 2002 in Athens, and I, naturally, expected to see it, some day, being released in DVD. But, it seems, that the director has a different opinion, as long as I have read an interview of his. Well, excuse me, Mr Joey Garfield, but I was a b-boy too, back in the days, and still am, and I also did exactly what you say regarding a lot of the same way, that many people learned how to break dance; through TV movies, commercials etc. But I strongly believe that your refusal not to release such a marvelous work into public availability is the most absurd, ironic, and even the most paradoxical thing in the history of the world cinema and art itself. How come the very producer of an art masterpiece like this one, locks it away and keeps it unknown? This brilliant documentary deserves its acknowledgment and, at least, should take its place next to &quot;The Freshest Kids&quot; and &quot;Scratch&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "The UK-Canada co-production treaty of the late Seventies produced a lot of dross.  &quot;Bear Island&quot; is better than some of its companions but still no classic.\n\nAlistair MacLean&apos;s novel was a turgid affair, written at the start of his long decline as a writer.  The film-makers wisely ditch most of his plot but the story they substitute, about an icy hunt for wartime Nazi gold, is no masterpiece of originality.  Vanessa Redgrave&apos;s Norwegian accent comes and goes (at times, she sounds like the Swedish chef from &quot;The Muppets&quot;) and Donald Sutherland tries for depth by speaking - very - very - slowly. Anybody who has seen a few of these films won&apos;t take long to guess the identity of the &quot;mystery&quot; villain.\n\nOn the credit side, the locations are spectacular and Robert Farnon&apos;s music score is appropriately portentous.  Don Sharp knows how to direct action (he had been brought in a few years earlier to ginger up another MacLean adaptation, &quot;Pupper On a Chain&quot;) and the fights are well-staged."

The sense of humor takes some time to develop, but when it does, it&apos;s quite winning. Those who are expecting another *Persepolis* will be disappointed; it is really very different, quirkier, and more uneven. But it definitely rewards attentive viewing.\n\nOne of the things I found interesting is that, unlike Persepolis, this movie really considers life from the perspective of a middle-aged man. Women here are either very objectified objects of sexual desire, or harpies. There are no intelligent women, such as one finds in *Persepolis.* That doesn&apos;t make the movie good or bad for me, but it was an interesting difference.",

Billy Drago proves that he is an acting god in this movie donning Indian garb and delivering such lines as &quot;When I come back here I&apos;m gonna pluck your sweet ass.&quot; with a seasoned punch. I&apos;d give this movie a 10 out of 10, better than any of those big budget films."

It wasn&apos;t just me -- the theater was full of people screaming with laughter and clapping at various moments.\n\nAlan Tudyk is hilarious every moment he is on screen. Finally this underrated actor has gotten a good-sized part where he can show off his comedy skills.\n\nMost of the actors are British and I did not recognize them, but they were excellent.\n\nOne I recognized was Jane Asher (she was Paul McCartney&apos;s girlfriend in the 60s -- he shoulda married her -- she&apos;s still alive and she&apos;s not a gold-digger). She plays the very composed widow here. (Oddly she has fewer creases on her face than her middle-aged sons.) \n\nThis film reminded me a bit of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, but even more of those British madcap black comedies of the 60s with Alec Guinness or Peter Sellers.",

Sam Neill plays her husband, and appears to be an afterthought.  For animals lovers, this movie has a disturbing beginning.  The movie is about relationships, daughter to mother; child to horse; husband to wife; man to horse.  The scenery in this movie is breath taking, and Redford took full use of it while directing the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Sadly, THE KICK is another Thai martial arts film that ends up disappointing rather than exhilarating. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love and adore the first quartet of these Thai films I watched: ONG BAK, BORN TO FIGHT, WARRIOR KING, and CHOCOLATE are all fantastic little films that I can happily watch over and over again. But everything else that has come since has been a disappointment.\n\nEven with ONG BAK director Prachya Pinkaew on board, and martial arts choreography from old timer Panna Rittikrai, THE KICK is an underwhelming film. There&apos;s a storyline about the hunt for a priceless and ancient kris (a type of eastern dagger) but the main narrative is bogged down by the antics of an unlikeable Korean Taekwondo team who really drag things down. The reason for their inclusion is that this film was part funded by South Korea, who obviously wanted a slice of Muay Thai for themselves.\n\nThe problem with this is that we get the likes of Tae-joo Na occupying most of the screen time. This Korean actor&apos;s acting is poor and his martial arts is little better, and the bit where he does a hip hop dance to beat up the villains is a huge embarrassment. At least the reliable Petchtai Wongkamlao (THE BODYGUARD) is on hand to bring some laughs, and the fantastic JeeJa Yanin (CHOCOLATE) stars in support as another fighter. But they really should have focused the story on Yanin alone and concentrated on doing great choreography and extensive fight scenes and then this would have been something special instead of weak and generic.",

The fact that this takes one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest actors&apos; sons and makes them garbage men, even more daring. The fact that Keith David is in it, is even more accommodating.\n\nMen At Work is a comedy classic.\n\nYou&apos;re probably ready to shoot me with a gun marked common sense, but no, this is really something else. Men At Work is the last in a long line of midnight movies that were released heavily in the 80&apos;s(i.e. Weird Science, Little Monsters, etc.) The formula of taking one situation and going over the top with everything, on an extravagant night when everyone else is asleep is a midnight movie. This just happens to involve toxic waste, which must have been a big deal in the eighties, because now, it&apos;s only packed with action figures.\n\nAnyway, it&apos;s a classic and stands out because it&apos;s just fun. The directing by Estevez isn&apos;t bad and it&apos;s also got some funny situations. The acting is what it&apos;s supposed to be, low key, but fun.\n\nJust imagine Double Dragon, but as garbage men.",

However when he finds himself exploited by a record producer he turns to drug running to make money.  When he kills a cop who is in on the trade he goes on the run and finds fame as an outlaw standing up against `the man&apos;.\n\nI first saw this in a cinema in 1995 and it was fully subtitled, I watched it again last night and it had no subtitles.  It was slightly hard to follow some of the very thick dialogue so I suggest if you have the choice that you go for the subtitles unless patwa is a very familiar dialect to you.\n\nThe plot takes swipes at the exploitative music business but also the nature of celebrity and the problems of drugs.  However at it&apos;s heart it&apos;s a reggae gangster movie that is gritty and enjoyable.  The story is involving but really it&apos;s the detail of the setting that carries the film.  The camera allows a great sense of place and really captures the mood and place well, using crowd shots and wandering shots to music.  Really the best scenes are all natural as music plays in the fore ground.\n\nThe music is one of the strongest aspects to the film  where the gangster element is sprawling and relaxed, the music allows us to accept this whole chilled out vibe as just part of the film.  The cast also helps greatly by being very realistic without much effort, not trying to make the accent easier is a brave move if you want to sell the film!  Cliff is easily believable and very watchable, likewise almost all the cast are great  many not being actors.\n\nOverall the plot may wander in the way only a Jamaican can! But the music and the vibe more than make this a cult film that is well worth watching whether with subtitles or not!"

In fact, Fortunes often looks like a TV production--and not just because of the poor model work. What isn&apos;t typical of a TV movie is the surprising amount of violence--Blood&apos;s crew is bludgeoned mercilessly when they are captured, whipped by the Marquis and his overseers, and forced to listen to Alfonso Bedoya&apos;s idiosyncratic line readings.\n\nI remember seeing Louis Hayward in The Black Arrow when I was about 10, and thinking that movie a great swashbuckler. Yet when I read the posts about it on IMDb, I wonder if my memory is playing tricks on me as well. Watching a bit of Fortunes on TCM, I rather suspect it is--this movie is pretty tepid, with the chief excellence being Hayward&apos;s performance, even though he gets no help from the script or director.",

Made on a shoestring budget by a small production company, it&apos;s a by-the-numbers example of a small-budget film with big-budget aspirations.\n\nThe plot itself is a fairly interesting take on well-treaded territory: the hero, Nick, invents a way to make his ultra-light plane travel through time and sells the idea to a CEO, only to later discover that the CEO is going to use it for, you guessed it, evil.\n\nThe excecution of the plot, however, suffers from a number of handicaps. The portrayal of the future (both the utopian and apocalyptic ones) is laughable at best with the former looking like an 80s shopping mall and the latter a bad Warriors knockoff. The main characters are all boringly average (causing Crow to dub the film &quot;The Adventures of the Average People&quot; in the MST3K episode), the only one having anything identifiably unique about them being the main character, Nick, whose only unique traits are &quot;building a time machine&quot; and &quot;not being able to drive a car&quot; (setting the stage for an absolutely ridiculous bicycle chase scene). If anything, the film reminds us that probably the only Vermont export of note is Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s Ice Cream (who, coincidentally, provided ice cream for the filming of this movie).\n\nAll in all, Tangents falls in the same general category of MST3Ked films as Overdrawn at the Memory Bank; a small budget film that is ridiculous enough on its own merits to make it a decent watch for lovers of pure cheese (though, as always, I recommend watching the MST3K version instead).",

What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along. Fascinating stuff. 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Ang Panday 2017 is one of the year&apos;s Most Anticipated Filipino Film, and it stars Coco Martin as Flavio III a.k.a. Ang Panday and Jake Cuenca as Lizardo. This movie is all about Flavio the III (Coco Martin), the grandson of Flavio Sr. (Fernando Poe Jr.), and the son of Flavio Jr. (Jeric Raval) who was adopted by Rosa (Gloria Romero) after an incident happened right after Flavio III was born.\n\nI&apos;m going to the &quot;Pros&quot; and &quot;Cons&quot; for this movie because the movie isn&apos;t that bad. There are some elements to it the kind of hooked me into it and made me hyped for this reincarnation of Panday.\n\nPROS: First, the action scenes are top-notch. Especially the sword fighting scenes in this movie will somehow get you on the edge of your sit. It won&apos;t let you down and it every action fight scenes seemed to payoff. Second, the VFX. My God! We are almost on the verge of improving Filipino&apos;s use of VFX. CGI are somehow kind of unnoticeable except during close ups. The CGI wouldn&apos;t bother you that much, not unless if you pay close attention to it...\n\nCONS: My God, this is going to be long. First, my problem is Flavio III&apos;s love interest Maria (Mariel De Leon). Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love Maria De Leon. She is nice, warm, and a beautiful woman. But her acting in this movie really bothers me. She is bland, uncharismatic, and useless. I mean, she doesn&apos;t contribute anything to the movie. She was just there to be Flavio&apos;s love interest and that&apos;s it! We didn&apos;t get much of a backstory from her, or some character development. She was just there maybe because Coco Martin wants her to be there. Second, there are too many characters. I know, this is the very first film that Coco directed and I will give him a pass for this. But my suggestion is, the next time he makes a movie, I want him to lessen the amount of cast in his film. This movie feels overcrowded. We are introduce to this cast of characters that doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the plot or doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the protagonist&apos;s character arc. There are these kids who I think wasn&apos;t suppose to be there because they&apos;ve done nothing, these elves that I think just there for the kids I think, and so much and so forth. They put a lot of effort into hiring these actors but they didn&apos;t put attention on what are their role in the movie is going to be. Third, is clumsy editing. I want you to go see this movie, and tell me how many times you see a camera through reflection, or some movie props in the background. Fourth, poor character development. Flavio&apos;s role in this movie doesn&apos;t live up to what a Panday has to be. Majority of the film, Flavio is a dick to everyone. Like literally. He was just given a task because of his bloodline and just accepts his fate for no vast reason. I wish they could&apos;ve gave him a motivation on why does he have to care about the people. Fifth, Jake Cuenca as Lizardo. I saw an interview of Jake Cuenca in &quot;Tonight With Boy Abunda&quot; and he mentioned that he took inspiration from Jared Leto&apos;s Joker. Well, wrong choice Jake. I love Jake Cuenca, I think he is a very terrific actor. I think he will be a veteran anytime soon. But he is poorly directed in this movie. His Lizardo is something I would describe as exaggeration. Lizardo&apos;s gestures and tone of voice here is so cringeworthy. There is no feeling of danger when he is in a certain scene. You wouldn&apos;t feel that this is Panday&apos;s greatest foe. I wish Jake Cuenca kind of toned down Lizardo a little and it&apos;ll work out. \n\nThis film is nothing but &quot;Ang Probinsyano&quot; that has a Fantasy genre and nothing but an all-out mess of a movie. Too many subplots and too many characters. If I would grade it by letter, I would give it a &quot;D-&quot;...",

      "reviewBody": "A bargain bin film you&apos;ll actually be glad you saw, Killjoy Goes to Hell is full of imagination, creepy costumes, and big laughs. With this installment it&apos;s clear that Charles Band and Full Moon Features is tired of being a laughing stock. They&apos;ve completely upped their game to compete in the new world of films. Trent Haaga (Killjoy) and Victoria De Mare (Batty Boop) deliver outstanding performances, they&apos;re funny, creepy, and have excellent dialogue. The fact that Killjoy&apos;s whole gang is back is another good sign too, lots of interesting characters to help you lose yourself in the B movie goodness. The settings were masterfully done, both crazy and creepy. Yup, all in all a fun watch whether it&apos;s a late night private viewing, or surrounded by friends. Takes me back to the early days of the Twisty Metal franchise. ~Fang",

      "reviewBody": "From plot to transition, from angle of lens to rhythmic montage, from editing to tone, from contrast to freeze frame..., you can get the impression involving Guy Ritchie, who may be referred as the Godfather of Film Noir. This story starts with a priceless emerald, a squad of slack guards and two gangs of thieves, one of which is amateur, while the other is professional judging from the looking. It is not difficult to speculate what would happen from this kind of stereotyped beginning. We can&apos;t tell which part is the imitation and which is the original. It&apos;s a concise and smart comedy, somehow, whose genre is quite different from traditional dramas we can watch at the Chinese cinema. Anyway, for the director, we can say, it&apos;s almost an perfect homework. It would make somebody laugh, but it is difficult to have the audience impressed as a milestone movie.",

      "name": "More Western than &apos;The Western&apos; itself",
      "reviewBody": "In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.\n\nAre you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.\n\nBut are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can&apos;t you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.\n\nThe almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it&apos;s uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.\n\nCharles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo&apos;s in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.\n\nIn a tavern the man meets Manuel &apos;Cheyenne&apos; Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn&apos;t be an overrated luxury.\n\nThe &apos;damsel in distress&apos; (although she isn&apos;t in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn&apos;t want to cross.\n\nThey are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.\n\nAnd finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you&apos;d like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes&apos; theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I&apos;d do it.\n\nSergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?\n\nFor Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre.\n\nAnd for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than &apos;Once Upon a Time in the West&apos;.",

A crazy old man who Aykroyd plays, we have the other comedy king CHEVY CHASE who is always fun to watch &amp; dan Aykroyds close buddy in real life is great here &amp; we have the BRILLIANT JOHN CANDY who also is fantastic &amp; a comic genius &amp; an all round good cast &amp; good characters. Aykroyd done a great job directing &amp; his movie is a good fun &amp; very inventive Comedy Thriller!!! Never follow critics just like &amp; enjoy what you like, i do.\n\nNow with that being said i do get that this is a bizarre &amp; weird film as it sits between silly comedy &amp; dark horror Thriller &amp; it tried to get that &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; vibe going &amp; in a way it did but obviously won&apos;t ever be a Classic like Tim Burtons Masterpiece.\n\nDan Aykroyd is a childhood hero of mine, i grew up watching him in the Classic &quot;Ghostbusters films&quot; &amp; &quot;Trading Places&quot; &amp; &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; &amp; &quot;Coneheads&quot; &amp; &quot;Celtic Pride&quot; &amp; &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; &amp; &quot;Dragnet&quot; &amp; &quot;My Girl&quot; &amp; &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; &amp; others, it&apos;s safe to say Aykroyd is a guy that has always been there making me laugh through my childhood &amp; teens &amp; still today as a family man, i love Aykroyd!!!!\n\nAykroyd is a Genius as a writer, actor &amp; of creative mind, i think he&apos;s the smartest of all the actors &amp; his Classic work proves it.\n\nFor a first movie &amp; a big studio production i think Aykroyd&apos;s Wacky &amp; weird Horror-Comedy &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot; is a misunderstood Cult Classic, it&apos;s supposed to be strange &amp; freaky &amp; bizarre, it came from the incredibly creative mind of a comic genius &amp; it&apos;s alot of fun!!!\n\nAykroyd puts in a fantastic &amp; manic performance here as the wacky old timer judge of his corrupted land, a monster of this nightmare like fantasy world that is dark but also ridiculously fun.\n\nChevy Chase is his sarcastic &amp; silly self (Always loved Chase) &amp; is in a good lead role &amp; even Demi Moore is fine here &amp; John Candy r.i.p is always a joy to see him being silly on screen, a great cast in fact.\n\nThe look is incredible with amazing cinematography by the best in the business DEAN CUNDY &amp; the sets &amp; production design is incredible, the detail of the set pieces is Amazing to look at, the mansion is beautiful &amp; makes the film come off feeling like a big fun wild roller coaster ride.\n\nBizarre yes but still fun &amp; very entertaining.",

This enthralling documentary, both sorrowful and hopeful, explores how stars, history and victims as well as survivors of an oppressive regime merge into one.\n\nThe images of a body with legs still chained and wrists bound, people digging in the desert for remains of their loved ones, a country that does not acknowledge the recent past, the testimony of a woman who lost her parents and drawings from the Chacabuco concentration camp merge with images of galaxies and supernovas, and talk of a current of energy, new life, pulsing through our existence. It is powerful stuff. Transitions and better organization are all that are wanting with this film.",

      "reviewBody": "This film starts as a shallow love story: two blokes in a bar hit on the woman they fancy by sending one of them over who tells her that the other one is terminally ill. &quot;Would you like a brain tumour or prostate cancer? - OK, OK, I know, so it&apos;s a brain tumour.&quot; Surprisingly women seem to believe this shtick and want to help the alleged coffin-dodger to a beautiful last night.\n\nUsing this trick, Tim, a canteen cook, gets to know Marie - and this time it isn&apos;t a one-night stand, but develops into something more serious. The snag is that Marie has a sister, Edda, who really suffers from cancer and only has a few months to live. She, of course, can see through the subterfuge right from the start and asks Tim to help her grant some last wishes.\n\nNow this film gets more serious, Edda doesn&apos;t want to live, she doesn&apos;t want to die - she is full of joy and very cranky, just the typical mood swings of someone who has to die.\n\nOccasionally some of what she wants reminds a bit of &quot;Knocking on Heaven&apos;s Door&quot;, the film about two cancer patients who want to go to the sea before they die and have a few adventurous last days. That film is rather a comedy, while &quot;Heiter bis wolkig&quot; is often a bit sadder. It raises a laugh, and it is tear-jerking, especially for people who have seen someone die of cancer. But don&apos;t worry, It isn&apos;t a depressing film, it&apos;s also a kind of fairy tale. Live your own life, try to make your dreams come true - that is the theme of &quot;Heiter bis wolkig&quot;.\n\nMax Riemelt as Tim, Jessica Schwartz as Edda and Anna Fischer as Marie are excellent, giving their characters some depth and making you feel with them.\n\nThe title isn&apos;t misleading; this film is partly cloudy: sometimes a bit sunnier, sometimes it can rain a bit.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;You cannot survive on rainwater alone.&quot;\n\nSo intones an unnamed government official at the beginning of The Hole, addressing the obstinate residents of an unnamed apartment building, who refuse to move out of their homes even though their area has become overrun by a mysterious plague that causes people to behave like cockroaches (and then die off, of course). The words take on an irony when we see that, in this apocalyptic world, rain never stops falling and the apartments&apos; residents struggle to keep leaks from destroying their remaining possessions.\n\nThere&apos;s not much to be said about plot here - a plumber visits a man because the woman below is complaining about leaks, and leaves a hole in the floor behind. The man above and the woman below take turns blocking up the hole and tearing away the other person&apos;s efforts to do the same - both of them seem loath to give up this one human connection.\n\nIt IS their only human connection. The woman below lives in utter seclusion, mopping up the floor and stopping up leaks in a pale imitation of a life. For all intents and purposes, she&apos;s a cockroach already, hiding in a dark, dank hole. The man above goes to his store every day, although his only customers are a starving cat and a confused old man whose favourite brands no longer exist. They go about their lives as though nothing were amiss, living quite apart. The rest of the apartment seems inhabited, but nobody stirs. Doubtless they&apos;re all also sitting in their little holes and trying to live their little lives. \n\nHere, Tsai is brutally satirizing the increasing lack of communication between human beings; even in the face of the end of the world, people remain isolated in their own little bubbles. This message was clearly prophetic, because the 2000s have come and people are living more apart than ever before; The Hole aims to unveil the absurdity of day-to-day life.\n\nIt&apos;s also worth noting that there are four musical numbers that begin at unexpected moments. A woman dances and sings in gaudy clothes and with loud instrumentals playing in the background. In one such scene, she and the man she pursues dance around and around as the traces of a fumigation rise up from the stairs and envelop them. These moments alone in the film do not resemble human behaviour; ironically, they&apos;re the only ones that make sense. The roaches&apos; compulsion to hide, too, makes sense. It&apos;s human nature that&apos;s the absurdity.",

It&apos;s so lazy done that you can take out which should be the cornerstone of this movie the Baltic Way and swap with what ever event and era you like and nothing will change. There are no artistic value and there are no historic value in this movie. All they are doing is trying so hard to play &quot;the good &apos;ol days&quot; and &quot;beautiful childhood&quot; cards but in the end this is so poor, so lazy and so not intriguing piece of nothing.\n\nThis movie is so bad that I&apos;m sad it took away the government monetary support from 15 other movies.\n\nAnd if you have a chance to choose what to do between watching this movie or how paint is drying, choose the paint. You won&apos;t be disappointed.",

The message and closing part is such good that stays with you for hours. Kat Dennings is very lovable and believable in her role, she has done a great job here. Music is also a strong point of it. I strongly recommend to go and watch it in cinemas when its officially released(hopefully in 2015).... but there&apos;s only one thing I don&apos;t understand.... and that is: This movie has been produced in 2012 and has been showed in a number of film festivals since,.... without having released officially in cinemas for public... Why??? Such good movie why should be stored in those lousy vulnerable hard drives of Sony Pictures company that long till those hackers from North Korea( or whatever) can get their dirty hands on it and publishing it over the peer to peer websites for people to download it for free?? that&apos;s a great shame... all the hard work of people involving to producing this beautiful movie are wasted now... what a pity... thats sad...",

The adavantage was of course a much larger budget but with both films that didn&apos;t really translate into quality. They had the money to have Joe Cocker do the title song but had it written by third rate hacks (except for Klaus Lage) that make Dieter Bohlen sound like Mozart. Essentially, the weakest point of both films is the writing. Zabou doesn&apos;t really have much of a story but more an excuse for a string of car chases and fight scenes. Maybe the director should not have asked his brother to write the screenplay. It&apos;s preditable and a good writer would have certainly helped to make it more intelligent but as an action film it works fine particularly for German standards. The car chases are really well made but some of the fight scenes look extremely amateurish. All in all the film works surprinsingly well and provides good entertainment for 90 minutes. There are some very well made atmospheric shots of Duisburg and particvularly the location of the last scene is spectacular. However you can&apos;t help thinking that in a way it is a missed opportunity due to he sub standard writing which the later Schmanski episodes show. What they lack in action the make up interms of quality of the stories.",

The setting sounded quite thrilling, but unfortunately, the entire movie is not. If the only way to produce thrills is to have a cockroach crawl around in front of a motion detector and have a sniper threaten to kill and kill a few people, then a movie is in trouble. Especially, because it repeats these cheap tricks too often.\n\nI might agree with the opinion, but to deliver a 90 minute argument in its favour and call it a movie - that is a crime against my taste."

      "reviewBody": "Cop is based on the book &apos;Blood and the Moon&apos; by James Ellroy. I have not read the book that the film is based on; although I am a big fan of the first three books in Ellroy&apos;s &apos;L.A. Quartet&apos;. It is often said of Ellroy that his writing got better as it went along; and assuming that this film is closely based on the book, I would say that there&apos;s a good chance that is true as the story here is not exactly solid. The entire film hinges on one major and quite unbelievable coincidence that boggles the mind if you care to think about it. However, it&apos;s the style and atmosphere that saves it; and that&apos;s the main reason I loved this film! The plot focuses on your everyday hard-bitten cop, Lloyd Hopkins, who after investigating the murder of a woman in Los Angeles, comes to believe that a serial killer may be operating in the area. Naturally, the police captain doesn&apos;t believe a word of it and Lloyd is forced to investigate on his own; leading him to a revelation closer to home than he was expecting.\n\nDirector James B. Harris creates a fabulous atmosphere for the film to take place in and ensures that L.A. seems to be every bit the gritty and sleazy location needed to facilitate a tale like this. Similarly, James Woods fits the central role like a glove and is always believable in the role; even when the plot is getting out of hand. The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible; but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer. It&apos;s not that the twist could not happen; it&apos;s more the way that it does happen which comes off as silly. It&apos;s just far too convenient and the whole film is turned on its head from that point on. Still, the atmosphere is retained and the story continues to be gripping; which are the film&apos;s strongest elements. Certain elements of the film are rather nasty, and indeed the book was originally denied by many different publishers for being too graphic! Still, a lot of it focuses on dialogue and from what I know of Ellroy, this part of the film is quite faithful. It all boils down to a rather hurried and coincidental ending; but I really do feel that this is a film where the style of it is much more important than the plot line. For some it will no doubt be too much of a problem...but I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good crime thriller!",

Ed and his dead mother have been the centerpiece for many movies.  Of all the films based on Gein (Psycho, TCM, Silence of the Lambs), this may be the most reality based.  However, it is also the dullest.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s a boring film.  On the contrary it&apos;s very interesting.  But when compared to those other films, it just seems lacking.  There&apos;s not much gore and you don&apos;t really get to see him kill anyone.  So why invest time with the film you ask.  Because of Steve Railsback.  Railsback performs wonderfully as the demented momma&apos;s boy. It&apos;s a joy to just sit back and watch him act.  His last lines of the film are especially disturbing.  This is the best of the current serial killer film craze that I have seen thus far however I do prefer the 70&apos;s film Deranged as a much creepier representation of Ed Gein&apos;s life."

      "reviewBody": "Cameron Vale (played by artist Stephen Lack) is a derelict who, after a bizarre incident in a shopping mall, is rounded up by two goons who bring him to eminent doctor Paul Ruth (Patrick McGoohan). Paul reveals to Cameron the reality of his situation: Cameron is in fact a &quot;Scanner&quot;, or a person with extraordinary telepathic abilities. Scanners can not only look into the minds of others, and manipulate them, but can also do very unpleasant things to human bodies. Paul recruits Cameron to help him track down Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside, in his breakthrough role), a rogue Scanner with plans for world domination.\n\nThe late, great Dick Smith was the special consultant to the makeup effects crew (Stephan Dupuis, Chris Walas, Tom Schwartz), and it&apos;s these effects that take center stage in this interesting and bleak thriller from Canadian legend David Cronenberg. The exploding head that everybody remembers so vividly actually occurs only about 13 and a half minutes into the show, so viewers don&apos;t have long to wait. Of course, as has been pointed out, how does one top something like that? Well, Cronenberg waits until the end to come up with a pretty good showdown between good Scanner and bad Scanner.\n\nThe pace is admittedly deliberate, but the ideas unfortunately don&apos;t feel completely fleshed out. Quite a bit of exposition is packed into the last act. The filming of this classic wasn&apos;t particularly enjoyable for Cronenberg as he *did* have to begin filming before his script was even finished, so he *was* unfortunately rushed. Still, his story is a damn entertaining and intense one.\n\nHoward Shores&apos; music score is wonderfully over the top and scary, and sets and locations do have a very sparse look. The acting is variable; McGoohan looks bored, as if he doesn&apos;t really want to be there, and Jennifer O&apos;Neill, while beautiful, doesn&apos;t really add anything to the film. Lack gets a lot of flak for his performance, which I&apos;ll agree isn&apos;t a particularly dynamic one, but it does suit the character, a man who was a lonely fringe dweller for a long time until being awakened into a larger reality. (Cronenberg does make an effective parallel here to the way that real life people with mental issues get treated.) Former Cronenberg repertory player Robert A. Silverman is fun in another of his offbeat parts, and Lawrence Dane is excellent as security chief Braedon Keller, but it&apos;s Ironside who completely steals the show as the nasty villain.\n\nWhile not without flaws, &quot;Scanners&quot; remains one of its directors&apos; most memorable efforts to date.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

Blier was only 22 when he made the film (not much older than his subjects) and, while he had the good fortune to have a famous actor for his father, this first piece of work is a little jewel in its own right- a rare chance to see captured on film a generation almost completely in ignorance of its future. Amongst them an unknown twenty-year-old Zouzou just a year away from fame and destined to be an icon of the decade to come. All just five years before May &apos;68."

From the set pieces to the action sequences, &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; has some of the best visual moments in the franchise. Unfortunately, the story and a true understanding of the Star Wars universe is lacking.\n\n\n* The actions of some of the characters are completely against what we have seen in other films (the treatment of Luke Skywalker is absurd).\n\n\n\n* The new characters introduced are irritating and shallow (Laura Dern&apos;s Vice-Admiral Holdo might be my least favorite character in Star Wars history).\n\n\n\n* Force sensitivity is a joke (Leia, Luke, Kylo and Rey).\n\n\n\n* The entire &quot;master code breaker&quot; plotline is frustratingly pointless.\n\n\nWhen I look at the poster for this movie, I think about the epic fight sequences and the daring visuals. This is fortunate, because the rest of the film is frustratingly disjointed from the rest of the franchise.\n\nBest Character: Kylo Ren Best Quote: &quot;Pass on what you have learned. Strength. Mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is.&quot; - Yoda Best Moment: The battle against Snoke&apos;s guards. The red scene!",

The editing, the shaky hand held cameras which made it difficult to read the subtitles, the musical numbers cut off before completion, the insertion of Ry Cooder and or his son into practically every frame, the story management - why did it not show the preparation and rehearsals leading up to the climax of Carnegie Hall. The touristy reactions in New York were too kitchsy for words and took the dignity of these brilliant musicians away.  I wanted more of these musicians&apos; stories and my favourite sequence was of the pianist playing in Havana and all these tiny little ballerinas dancing around him, caught up in the magic. More of the history of the Buena Vista Social Club would have been wonderful also - this was sad in its omission. These incredible musicians were not served well here."

To be frank, there&apos;s nothing bad in this movie. But, i didn&apos;t say it&apos;s not flawed. I was just expecting another horror flick with jump scares and blood spewing all over the place. One minute into the movie, i was rather surprised. \n\nThe story is about an innocent teenage girl named Carrie (Chloë Grace Moretz), whom has a mentally abusive mother (Julianne Moore). Her life was very miserable. She got bullied at school and her neighborhood condemn her as being a freak. Until, she found out that she has a telekinetic power that could control every single thing. But, she doesn&apos;t know how far her power could go and do to the people who pushes her. All is well until one night that changed it all.\n\nThe movie is a remake of the 1976 version. I am glad to say that it was never boring. I was pinned down to the seat and saw the whole thing, especially the climax which i won&apos;t spoil any of it.\n\nJulianne Moore, wow! I can&apos;t say a word about her performance here. She brought the hell out of her and made me witness her craziness. It was all very freaky and horrifying. Chloë Grace Moretz played the role as Carrie convincingly and made me feel about her character. All of the cast were well-acted.\n\nThough, there&apos;s just a minor thing i would criticize. \n\nThe CGI wasn&apos;t all that spectacular. Sometimes we could see that it&apos;s not real. And the pacing was a bit off. Yet, i&apos;d have to say it was well-executed and the effect was pretty gruesome at times. \n\nConclusion: Very solid remake and recommended for people who loves to be scared, and believe me, you WILL know her name."

While it is a little dated now, due to advances in computers (and the fact that Rosalie&apos;s computer crimes would not likely happen today), it is such a monumentally freakish film that you just can&apos;t miss it.\n\nHow can you miss seeing the late Brad Davis in one of his most unlikely roles?  And how can you miss seeing Judge Reinhold as a priest who keeps having to listen to Rosalie teling him of all her crimes?  The mere spetacle of Germans in rural Arkansas is reason enough to see this fun little film. It has no big message, really, except poking fun of 1980&apos;s American consumerism, but the sheer wackiness of the family in this movie makes it a worthwhile diversion for a night when you could use a laugh.",

      "reviewBody": "From the director of disturbia, I know this movie will be intense and thrilling. Shia Labeouf and D.J. Caruso with Steven Spielberg come up with a second feature movie. This is bigger, more intense and more action than disturbia. D.J. Caruso proves that he can create a more intense movie with cars exploding with a bigger budget. Eagle Eye is intense and thrilling but the story is a bit weird and simple.\n\nThe story: The story is not original as we probably heard this kind of stories before. Though it is not original, I like it for its thrills and suspense. I have seen better action than in this. The plot- Shia plays Jerry Shaw in the movie who is following orders from an unknown caller. Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) is involved in the insane orders. They start running, going from one place and other and collect stuffs. There is exploding action in between. There is a mild twist added- the caller. For an intense action movie, it is good. But if I consider it for its plot, it is just mildly interesting.\n\nOverall: If you have seen disturbia, you might want to catch the director&apos;s second feature. You want intense movies, here is one. Those looking for interesting and realistic plus not laughable plot, this probably may make you lift an eyebrow, thinking how the heck the caller do this and that. Whatever it is, it made my time passed.",

      "reviewBody": "The Western is not my favorite genre. I&apos;ve seen some of John Ford&apos;s classics and many B-Westerns. Of most I can&apos;t even remember the titles, but this one is different. It&apos;s much more a psychological study, without the grand landscapes, backgrounds or epic story lines. If John Ford&apos;s splendid cinematography is not for you, this one cuts back to the basics of human relationships, without the epic adventure many Westerns try to depict. \n\nThis film is skimmed down to an absolute minimum with Gregory Peck as Jimmy Ringo, notorious killer and the deadliest shot in the Old West. Though his appetite for bloodletting is over, Ringo is forced to stay on the run from young ambitious gunners determined to shoot him down. After killing an upstart in self-defense, he escapes to the nearby town of Caynenne. There, he hopes to convince his estranged wife (Helen Westcott) to resume their life together, but his arrival causes a sensation. With more young bucks gunning for him, Ringo&apos;s fate lies in the hands of the sheriff (Millard Mitchell), his old bandit partner.\n\nWith this film the old credo, &quot;less is more&quot;, is evident. No great showdowns, not much action, just Gregory Peck in a great character study with carefully built-up tension. He never let me down, giving a fantastic performance, again. \n\nCamera Obscura --- 9/10"

      "reviewBody": "In the world of espionage, Agent 69 Jensen (Ole Søltoft) is a horny hero with a license to thrill. This 1977 Danish erotic comedy, directed by Werner Hedman, is a raunchy romp through the genre of spy movies, delivering laughs, thrills, and plenty of skin. With a style reminiscent of James Bond, the film offers a humorous take on the classic secret agent formula, spiced up with explicit sex scenes.\n\nAgent 69 Jensen i Skorpionens tegn (Agent 69 in the Sign of Scorpio) doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously. The plot follows Agent Jensen as he awaits his next mission while working undercover at a convenience store. Soon enough, he&apos;s tasked with delivering a microfilm to the CIA, but the villainous Scorpio sends his best agent, Matty Hari (Gina Janssen), to intercept it. What follows is a hilarious and sexy cat-and-mouse game, with Jensen&apos;s incompetence and libido often getting the better of him.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t hold back on the adult content, and one scene in particular stands out. Jensen finds himself in a compromising position with Matty Hari, who uses her seductive skills to try and obtain the microfilm. The scene is an erotic dance of lust and desire, a sensual spy-vs-spy encounter that ends with both agents satisfied but no closer to their mission objectives.\n\nWhile the movie has its moments of hilarity and heat, it does tend to meander, especially in the second half. The parody elements are well-executed, but the story loses focus at times, and the jokes don&apos;t always land. However, fans of over-the-top spy comedies and explicit erotica will find something to enjoy here.\n\nOverall, Agent 69 Jensen i Skorpionens tegn is a fun and frisky ride through the world of secret agents, with a healthy dose of Danish humor and sexuality. It&apos;s a film that embraces its B-movie status and delivers on its promise of entertainment for adults only.",

      "reviewBody": "A vanity project for a bunch of Hollywood&apos;s highest paid comedic actors, playing themselves in a &quot;stoner comedy&quot;. So how do you make that good? By making it an hilarious, smart, insightful, satirical and scathing commentary on religion, celebrity and Los Angeles. And how do you make that successful? By making it a stoner comedy about a hapless group of actors saying and doing the stupidest things.\n\nIt actually starts out pretty slowly with a lame story being introduced. Jay Baruchel comes to LA to hang out with his friend Seth Rogen who wants to hang out with his friends James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson, but Jay doesn&apos;t like his friends and he doesn&apos;t think that they like him. Sounds kind of lame doesn&apos;t it? The party at James Franco&apos;s house delivers the ridiculous, raunchy comedy which the target audience craves but it doesn&apos;t yet include the intelligence which the rest of the audience is applauding.\n\nIt seems like everybody in Hollywood is at James Franco&apos;s house. Michael Cera is doing coke, Jonah Hill is being friendly and everybody else is finding another drug to imbibe. While Jay and Seth are off to buy cigarettes, the Heavens open up and the Earth caves in. And then the real fun begins. Knowing the title of the film, or having read the bible, or really having seen any loose interpretation of the apocalypse, it&apos;s pretty obvious what is happening. And we get our first glimpse of the film&apos;s take on the celebrity culture and what it does (and what will eventually happen) to those at the center of it.\n\nOur heroes aren&apos;t quite sure what&apos;s going on. Remember, they are actors in Hollywood. It&apos;s probably an earthquake, or it could be a zombie invasion, or it could be the end of the world as described in the New Testament&apos;s Revelation. But who believes that stuff?\n\nThe majority of the film takes place with our five actors holed up in James Franco&apos;s house – which is like a cement cave designed by himself since he&apos;s an artist. The jokes are vulgar, crass, silly but also incredibly insightful into who they are and the result is a perfectly written self-parody. You have to get past a lot of penis jokes, but once you do, you&apos;ll find an under-current tackling the issues of celebrity status but also of celebrities&apos; biggest detractors, the religious congregation. I don&apos;t think &quot;This Is the End&quot; will be successfully duplicated any time soon, but I also don&apos;t foresee the apocalypse hitting any time soon.",

      "reviewBody": "Underrated would be the main qualification for this splendid movie.\n\nIt&apos;s a pity that our taste has been ruined by the avalanche of movies made with the technique used for TV commercials --superfast cutting almost to the point of never assimilating the scene, it goes by so fast-- and of course, accompanied by guns, shooting, blowing people and vehicles all over the screen, violence being the most important factor in practically every film. \n\nThis time we are confronted with a very different product. This movie starts very quietly --directed very evenly by Giorgio Diritti-- a car drives through gorgeous sceneries --Italy, the Piamonte region-- valleys, mountains, incredibly majestic setting, and a zigzagging road bordering a deep abyss, and we are introduced to a couple of natives within the car, discussing the selling or renting of one of the properties in this small village --Ussolo, within the valley Maira-- that once, in 1900 had 1.000 inhabitants and nowadays no more than 50? to a french cheese maker. \n\nAt first the quite old natives are very enthusiastic about the new arrival, since the village is almost dead --everybody left it long ago to look for better lives in faraway places-- and they make plans, thinking that the cheese maker could be a good addition to the summer months when the tourists will come (In winter the weather is very bitter and the snow covers everything). \n\nThe film develops this idea starting with a very moving reception from the natives to the newcomers from France --only this couple are professional actors: Thierry Toscan and Alessandra Agosti-- but everybody else in this movie is as good an actor as anybody you could think of-- and slowly but surely incidents start building up and greed, envy and the worst feelings in human beings start to raise their ugly heads.\n\nExcellent development, excellent camera work and excellent everything! If you saw &quot;Stromboli&quot; with Ingrid Bergman --Rosellini directing-- this film has an approximation in its story to that one, that is, the main characters are driven out of the village because if they remain, their lives will become hellish.\n\nIt&apos;s very impressive the way one notices the gradation of moods changing from good to nasty. And when I say nasty, I mean NASTY. \n\nTo me, this is a jewel of the Italian cinema, but unfortunately, a totally noncommercial production. The film is in Italian and the particular dialect (Occitane) of this place --very difficult to understand, so much so that when they speak it, the subtitles in Italian translate the meaning TO ITALIANS!",

His erstwhile boss offers him a major payday to switch some electronic gizmo that will give the CIA an ear into OGPU headquarters; all he has to do is head to Berlin, meet up with former lover Brigitte Fossey, evade every Stassi agent in the country and Russian spy Sam Neill.\n\nIt&apos;s one of those movies with an old-time serial feel: how&apos;s Sheen going to get out of this cliff-hanger? And why are people doing whatever it is they&apos;re doing? French locations in mid-winter and drab signs stand in for a depressing East Germany, and Jeannot Szwarc&apos;s explication-free direction doesn&apos;t pander to the audience, but keeps the movie interesting throughout.",

      "name": "This is not a kungfu film",
      "reviewBody": "THE SWORDSMAN is a movie very much in the style of the classically-influenced Wuxia movies of the 1960s, like DRAGON GATE INN (1966) and A TOUCH OF ZEN (1969), which was based in turn on a Qing Dynasty (17th Century) story by Songling Pu. These sword movies were at their most popular in the years running up to the earliest kungfu movies like Chinese BOXER (1970) and THE BIG BOSS (1971), but are not to be confused with the more familiar martial arts movies, as they have conventions and rules all their own.\n\nWuxia movies are typified by the spectacular sword battles where antagonists fly through the air in prodigious leaps as they cross swords. This kind of spectacle may have reached its pinnacle in the stunning sword battles seen IN CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HERO, but it can trace its roots back to the earliest swordplay movies of King Hu and the first New Wave movies like Tsui Hark&apos;s ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN. But Wuxia films are also about honour and the code of the warrior, and in this respect resemble Samurai movies more than kungfu films.\n\nIn THE SWORDSMAN, the students of the Hua Mountain style of sword fencing have developed their Chi (internal power) to such a high degree that they are able to quite literally float through the air during their sword battles. Most powerful of all the Hua Mountain practitioners is Sifu Ngok, teacher to the young hero of the story Ling Wu Chung. Or so it seems. Early in the film, Wu Chung meeting an elder of the Hua Mountain Clan, Fung Ching Yeung, who&apos;d gone into hiding so his enemies wouldn&apos;t try to control him by harming his family. Fung recognises Wu Chung as one of his own clan and teaches him the deadly &quot;Nine Solitary Swordplays&quot; and it is these techniques he uses against his own traitorous sifu.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, &quot;The Song&quot; does get a bit of a caning in this movie, and I defy anyone who&apos;s heard it once to get it out of their heads in less than five days.\n\nAnd it should be pointed out that Celia Yip is fooling no one with that boy disguise. Though in all fairness, this &quot;girl disguised (badly) as boy&quot; routine crops up a lot in Chinese stories. Anyone remember the equally gorgeous Kara Hui (Hui Ying-Hung) in EIGHT DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER searching for brother Gordon Liu disguised as a man?\n\nWuxia have to be accepted on their own terms. There is a prevailing belief in China that the Chi abilities of martial artists in historical times were far superior to what contemporary kungfu experts are capable of. This is no different to the belief in the West that ancient seers were able to predict the future. Neither set of beliefs have any real credibility, but it makes for fun storytelling.\n\nTHE SWORDSMAN is a pretty good example of the genre, but to be honest, the sequel, SWORDSMAN II, is the better movie.",

It&apos;s like the saying &quot;look into the abyss, and the abyss looks back&quot;, meaning these characters are living in their own worlds until our protagonist stumbles in.

There&apos;s definitely an attempt to set atmosphere over numerous scenes of gore. There is attempt to develop the characters. The ending is what makes the film memorable. Maybe the motivations for the killings isn&apos;t original, but it doesn&apos;t have to be. Sometimes in life bad people win. It sucks. It&apos;s infuriating, but sometimes that&apos;s how it goes. I applaud the writers and directors for going against the grain with this one.",

Ollie is diagnosed with hornaphobia (in fact, you&apos;re on the verge of hornamania!) by James Finlayson and advised to get some calm ocean air to relieve his jangled nerves.  With Stan acting as nurse, the boys hire a boat, intending to stay moored to the dock until their goat (the doctor advises plenty of ghost&apos;s milk) gnaws through the mooring and they are left to drift out to sea accompanied by escaped prisoner Nick Grainger (and Nick jr.).  Some scenes had me rolling in laughter - Ollie blowing up the lungtester, the banana, the synthetic meal, the dodgy plumbing and the fight scene at the end.  If you&apos;ve seen this film you&apos;ll know what I&apos;m talking about.  If you haven&apos;t then I recommend you find out. **** out of *****"

The production started in 1924 and took three long years to complete, mainly due to financial problems.\n\nTwo participants of the cast, later became prominent personalities of the Sub Continent film industry: A.R.Kardar who was one of the most famous Bombay film directors in the 1930&apos;s, 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s; and M.Ismael, the actor, whose film career spans over five decades.\n\nThese two persons were the real pioneers of Pakistan film industry but they remain unsung heroes of Lollywood, as the Lahore industry is called today. Their later joint ventures are better documented and some stills from &quot;The Mysterious Eagle&quot; (1927) and The Serpent (1928)are available for the viewing pleasure of the enthusiast."

      "reviewBody": "Ridley Scott&apos;s new flick American Gangster was a good one. Though Im not gonna be saying it&apos;s the best film of the year or anything like that. It was directed well, barely any dull scenes, great acting by an enormous cast and was really well-written. Unfortunately the story never seemed &quot;new&quot; to me. I was reminded of other drug-related/crime movies, like BLOW, CITY OF GOD, and evening TRAINING DAY.....&quot;My Man&quot;. Though it&apos;s in the leagues as being entertaining as the above mentioned movies, it really just never felt like I was watching a &quot;new&quot; story. But speaking of story, I never knew anything about Frank Lucas, and his story is fantastic. A black man who was more influential than his Mafian brethren? Tell me you&apos;re kidding. Nope, he was a force in Harlem back in the late 60s and early 70s and barely anyone knows about it. But for me this area of the film was the only stand out part. Sure there are other good scenes, done well, but nothing worth mentioning. Well, scratch that, naked women workin in a drug lab was an eye-opening scene.\n\nDenzel Washington won the Oscar when he portrayed the crooked cop in Training Day who said &quot;My Man&quot; all the time. Well, in the American Gangster you got him saying this line again, and by God does he have it down. There are scenes when you know he&apos;s gonna say it, and he still pulls it off incredibly well. Denzel is one actor you really never have to worry about it in the acting department. You&apos;ve got Russell &quot;Mr. Oscar&quot; Crowe playing the other lead, and like always, he always has the character down. He was great in this flick, the accent, the mannerisms, all of it. Though, his character&apos;s story was interesting in that he was in charge of the case to figure out who the big boy druglords were, his side story with his wife was for me the &quot;dull&quot; parts of the film. They were well-acted and all that, but mostly, it was just character development that isn&apos;t needed. Russell Crowe&apos;s good enough an actor to portray a struggling cop without a family problem. And also let me say Josh Brolin as the crooked cop was great. I didn&apos;t need a side-story of him doing tons of drugs and banging prostitutes....but ya know he was doing it.\n\nAmerican Gangster was a really good flick. It had amazing acting mixed with scenes that shed a new light on drug-trafficking....or should I say Old light. Though since there are so many other drug/crime cop films out there it seems a little been there done that. But don&apos;t let that sway you if you enjoy good movies and or crime films. And also, Frank Lucas is one hell of an interesting personality. My man. 8.5 outta 10",

      "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: I like Albert Pyun&apos;s films.  But &quot;Ticker&quot; is awful.  I don&apos;t know how it could have happened.  OK, I suppose I do know how it happened. It was, after all, pretty easy to spot the doubles used for the actors in over half the film, as well as the bad looping accompanying it.  The opening stock footage sequence and endless shots of the bomb-disarming (or is that &apos;device-treating&apos;?) robot in action didn&apos;t help the picture any either. This was a low budget effort, only it was a low budget effort made in a terrain unfamiliar to Pyun  Los Angeles.  Even in a &quot;bad&quot; Pyun film (Omega Doom, Blast, Nemesis 4), there is that familiar Pyun style that makes the experience palatable.  But in this case, if it weren&apos;t for the appearance of various Pyun players (Weisser, Malcon, Halsey, and a lunchbreak cameo by Ice-T), I would have never been able to tell that &quot;Ticker&quot; was directed by Pyun.  There was no thought put into this one whatsoever, it seems.  I&apos;m more apt to believe what was implied on the director&apos;s commentary, that over-the-hill-and-then-some action guru Steven Seagal had more to do with the production of this movie than Pyun did.  Yes, I did listen to the commentary.  And if I didn&apos;t feel like an hour and a half were stolen from my life beforehand, I felt twice the impact after viewing it with the audio track.  My advice to others: if you feel the masochistic desire to see the DVD, and have any interest at all in the commentary, just watch it with the commentary the first time and get it done with.  You won&apos;t miss a thing from the movie, as minutes  nay, entire chapters  go by without either of the guys saying a word.  I&apos;m not sure why they even bothered with a commentary; it&apos;s fairly obvious how this movie was &quot;made&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Never posted anything here before, but after watching Noroi I just felt that I had to write down my thoughts about it.\n\nFirstly do not compare this to Blair Witch, this movie deserves far better than that! Simply put, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot!).\n\nI really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (i think?) named Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without spoiling to much about the plot, I can say it that it starts with Kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister.\n\nWhile the story might not be that original in itself, what really hooked me with Noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. If you&apos;re looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes this movie might not be for you. This movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense. The documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable.\n\nThis is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! Far better than in most other movies in this type of genre.\n\nWell enough ranting from me, I highly recommend Noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, creepy, well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.",

She was a mouthwatering beauty back then! The film rolls along pretty blandly but the scenes with C. Thomas Howell getting framed are pretty well done and plausible.  If you can get over the guy owning his own Sherman tank, the  decision to use it makes at least some sense by that point in the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This was bad on a Jurassic scale. Given it is a movie from The Asylum, then at least we as the audience have an ounce of hope that this might just be one of those movies that stand out from the rest of the movies that they spew out. But no. I must say that given the cover/poster for the movie, I had my hopes up just a little bit, but when I saw THE ASYLUM on the screen as the movie started, all hopes evaporated like dew before the rising sun.\n\nThe idea was pretty much everything that was used in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; movies; dinosaurs have been brought back to life by the hands of humans with the help of technology and research. And of course, these dinosaurs break free of their captivity and wreck havoc on a major city - in this case Los Angeles.\n\nRight, almost textbook page by page copy from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, well, and then exposed to The Asylum. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nI will say that the dinosaurs as CGI animated creatures were actually quite alright. However, when they brought in the prosthetics and puppets it just went from alright to oh-so-wrong. These non-CGI animated dinosaurs were such an eyesore that it was downright embarrassing to watch. Especially the scene with the pteranodon in the helicopter. Look at the beak when it is CGI animated and then look at the difference in texture and color even when it is a real prosthetic used. It was just so bad.\n\nStory-wise, then &quot;Age of Dinosaurs&quot; was nowhere near as interesting as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and chances are that if you have seen any of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; movies and enjoyed them, then you don&apos;t really want to spend 88 minutes on this movie. The story was as plain, predictable and textbook material as they come.\n\nAnd what about the title itself, &quot;Age of Dinosaurs&quot;? Wouldn&apos;t that actually indicate a period of time spanding more than a single day? Well, I guess the title was just about as good as the actual movie was.\n\nRegarding the acting in the movie, well, nothing overly interesting here. You have TV pseudo-legend Treat Williams, but he is barely making it watchable. And then there was Ronny Cox, which was actually nice to see, though this is not one of his best movies, not by a long shot.",

We were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of Earth. This film has some of the most breathtaking photography I have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things I have never seen in a film, TV or book! &quot;Earth&quot; is a film that every student should see before they become jaded. I will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her. This is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic.",

Very fast paced at the start the movie gradually slows down, turning into a romantic comedy. Never dull, bringing Monty Python skits to mind at times. Behind the witty plot is a French writer, Roland Topor. No sledgehammer &quot;Naked Gun&quot;-like humor in this one, but if you like a good laugh and a good plot you should see it.",

Well, my monster loving friends &amp; myself were all over that. Turned out that the pet monster was a silly little rubbery goofy animal. Everyone loved them nonetheless! We all enjoyed the movie &amp; it was billed as a second feature along with D.A.M. Destroy All Monsters! What a blast! War of the Gargantuas was definitely the better of the two flicks and every time I went to the beach after that kept hearing that eerie music and waited for the green gargantuan to rear his big ugly head out of the ocean. The ultimate battle between good (brown gargantuan) and evil (green gargantuan) as can best be done in Japanese monster fashion. Russ Tamblyn was popular at the time after appearing in West Side Story and Tom Thumb. I would say this was his best movie. I recommend it to any monster movie buff. MikeW"

The actors and acting are generally very good too, Fita Benkhoff is great and the Kessler twins add a lively touch. Only Gunther Philipp is too old for the role of Jan, not only to make a believable student, but even more so as a desirable husband for Komtesse Bronislawa. However, half of Millöcker&apos;s music is missing! Many of those beautiful and well-known songs simply do not show up. Some of the key lyrics are used in the dialog, but this just reminds the viewer what is missing. It seems the script writer tried to concentrate on the story line and didn&apos;t have the time left for the songs. Since the story lines of operettas are generally nonsense anyway, this was the wrong approach.",

      "reviewBody": "Imagine living in a world where the bus you are riding on could, at any given moment, detonate into a fiery deathtrap in a deliberate act of mass murder, or the café you are sitting at be rocked to its very foundations by a well-placed briefcase filled with explosives. How would living in so perpetual a state of high alert affect the things you did, the places you went to, the people you saw? And how would such an environment determine the structure of the society itself, the laws it proscribed and the way in which it treated its people? And could terrorism itself become such a commonplace and familiar fact of everyday life that even it might lose the ability to shock and horrify the very people closest to it? \n\nFinding the means of successfully combating terrorism has, of course, become a life-or-death necessity for the people of Israel. One of their responses to the threat has been to instigate mandatory military service for all their young people. Another has been to subject Arabs to legal random searches - simply for being Arabs. In the Israeli film, &quot;Close to Home,&quot; Smadar and Mirit are two young Army officers whose job it is to check the ID&apos;s of anyone in their assigned area who happens to look like a Palestinian. Possibly because they have grown up with terrorism as a regular part of their lives, these girls seem to have developed a strange immunity to its effects, for neither seems overly impressed with the seriousness of the job they are doing - although, of the two, Mirit is a little more concerned about what might happen to them were they found to be in any way derelict in their duties. Smadar and Mirit are not exactly natural buddies, but, over time, they develop a certain tenuous closeness that seems sure to blossom into a full-fledged friendship by the end of the story. Or will it?\n\n&quot;Close to Home&quot; is more of a naturalistic study of the day-to-day lives of these two women than it is a heavily plotted narrative. Most of the film is spent chronicling their interactions with their military superiors, the random people they are forced to interrogate, and, most importantly, each other. Smadar Sayar and Neama Shendar create believable, memorable characters who perform their task more out of a sense of duty than a fiery love of country. It&apos;s only when an explosion hits a little too close to home that they are, at least momentarily, shaken out of their lethargy. But even that doesn&apos;t last for long, as the girls begin to slack off at their jobs once again, with Smadar becoming an ever more potentially corrupting influence on the decidedly less rebellious Mirit.\n\nIf the filmmakers, Vardit Bilu and Dalia Hager, have a political point to make, it is well hidden beneath the deceptively casual surface of the girls&apos; relationship. For this is, first and foremost, a story about Smadar and Neama, about two Israeli youngsters who, despite the extraordinary conditions under which they are forced to live, are basically interested in the same things that preoccupy young people the world over: moving away from home, pursuing romantic interests, deciding on hairstyles and fashions. If anything, the filmmakers seem to be saying that it really isn&apos;t possible for the human mind to exist in a state of constant readiness no matter how great the threat, that eventually the concerns of common everyday life will rise to the surface and crowd most everything else out. Bilu and Hager clearly acknowledge the reality of the terrorist threat, but they also know that a life ruled by fear is no life at all.\n\nIn a subtle but persuasive way, the movie also raises the extremely touchy question of just how far a nation should go in abrogating the civil liberties of any single group in exchange for increased safety. It is an issue Israel has been dealing throughout its entire existence, and the movie makers clearly acknowledge that there is no simple solution to that conundrum - a conundrum that has, unfortunately, become increasingly relevant beyond the limits of the Israeli border.",

This film&apos;s reputation suffers from its inexplicable title and unfavorable comparisons to the original.  But it&apos;s useless to compare since this film is an altogether different beast.  Friedkin gives it his usual nihilist/fatalist/existential stamp, making it a much darker film than the French version.  Very suspenseful and well-made.  Made by Friedkin at the height of his powers.  His third best film after Exorcist and French Connection."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Brothers&quot; (Hing Dai) is your typical Hong Kong gangster movie, and it doesn&apos;t fail to deliver. At the beginning, a fortune teller tells the Tam family mob boss that his two sons will fight against each other in the future, so he sends one of them to the US to separate them. Inevitably, they end up getting together again and the story unfolds. While the story isn&apos;t exactly groundbreaking, the cast does a stellar job playing their roles. Lead actor Kiu Wai Miu is cold, resilient, and mysterious as the older brother who takes care of the family business, while Eason is the innocent &quot;clean&quot; younger brother. Eason does a decent job but his role doesn&apos;t really require anything out of the ordinary. Kiu Wai Miu pretty much holds the movie together with his unpredictability. You have no idea if he&apos;s good or bad, if he still has a hidden hint of decency, or just ruthless. Mainland actress Li Huang is the female lead, although her role is fairly small, I was a bit disappointed in her to be honest. She must have some connections within the entertainment circle because she gets an awful lot of roles, yet each time she&apos;s really nothing more than a (decently) pretty face. In most of her scenes, she gives me the impression of a deer caught in headlights. In Mainland China, she started out with smaller roles such as the helper or assistant of the female leads, and I think that&apos;s what she does best.\n\nThe real show stealer here, is Andy Lau, also one of the producers of the movie. He plays an arrogant cop, blatantly over the top with his attitude, but there is only a very small handful of actors who can pull it off and look legit. Andy is definitely one of them. And my goodness, the guy is in fantastic shape! In his first scene, he makes instant impact with his coolness and suave exterior. I don&apos;t know if he got a facelift, some anti-aging treatment, or just a healthy diet, he is in great shape and looks much younger than before. He is so cocky, that even his coworkers are played (fooled) on a constant basis, yet he doesn&apos;t become annoying. Rather, I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions, and shaking my head at how arrogant this guy is. He certainly adds spice to the movie and keeps things interesting.\n\nBrothers, while not an incredible film, is still a decent rental at the least. The reason I give it 7 rather than 5 or 6, is because it&apos;s very well paced, and the solid acting from Kiu Wai Miu and pure entertainment from Andy Lau kept me on the edge of my seat at all times. There are very few dull moments, and the final scenes of the movie were tense enough as well. A good gangster flick to end the year on."

      "reviewBody": "This is actually a decent retelling of Mark Twain&apos;s &quot;The Prince &amp; The Pauper&quot; and it&apos;s set in Korea. It&apos;s a alright retelling and does have it&apos;s moments and entertainment value. But nothing much to make it stick. It just showed up into Korean theaters and disappeared as quickly with hardly any mention of it by the media. A movie called &quot;Masquerade&quot; came out during the same year which has a similar premise going for it and made a hit. Maybe that is because it had Lee Byung-Hun in it who is a top star in Korea. But this movie was a bit of a flop, which is kinda unfortunate because it&apos;s actually a decent movie. Nothing spectacular or a movie that will stick around for a long time. But it has decent entertainment and comedic value with some good morals. Personally I enjoyed this movie, it&apos;s a fun watch. I didn&apos;t think it was all that memorable but I had a good time sitting through it the first time.\n\n6.8/10",

One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in jail. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko&apos;s message out to the world.\n\nIn &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko&apos;s word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.\n\nAs one of two movies (along with &quot;A World Apart&quot;) that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved.",

The film effectively builds up a sense of dread through the central character&apos;s isolation and growing unease in a bleak village surrounded by featureless salt marshes. The supporting cast are thoroughly creepy from the garrulous dwarf mayor through to the pale beauty who mysteriously hooks up with the hero but who seems to know more than she is letting on. There are some touches of unsettling imagery that evoke David Lynch; the snails in the fridge, the blood red car and motorcycle and the house of the laughing windows itself. The camera-work adds to the whole, peering from darkened rooms and from behind creaking shutters - there is rarely a moment when you feel the hero is safe.\n\nSharing some of the mood of Don&apos;t Look Now (as indicated by Barry Norman below), the film also bears comparison with The Wicker Man, dealing with the same theme of an innocent slowly discovering the horrifying secrets of a community consumed by evil.",

      "reviewBody": "Different people explain in this fine documentary how Luis Buñuel started to invent surrealist cinematic imagery and why he wanted to shock people and why he despises organized religion, faith and of course certain bourgeoisie. The importance of Toledo (to Jose Bello, Dali, Buñuel and Lorca) is explained and what impact Velazquez, Goya and Cervantes had in Buñuel&apos;s films. Also explained is why the acting in his films is always sober and never over-acted (i.e. use of eyebrows and nodding etc.). Although it is in chronological order from birth to death, it somehow does not feel complete. But a documentary can&apos;t really fathom ALL essential factors in the life and work of such an icon in cinema in 98 minutes, when 8 minutes are spent on how Buñuel used to drink his Martini&apos;s.\n\n&apos;I discovered cinema in 1908 as an attraction at the carnival: a simple technical discovery. But it was the invasion of something totally new in our Medieval universe.&apos;\n\nMore than twenty friends, actors, cinematographers, family and writers are interviewed and there are many excerpts from most of Buñuel&apos;s films. Luis Bunuel even has some screen time as he is interviewed (that must be at least 18 years before the making of this documentary). I was disappointed that neither cinematographer Edmond Richard, who shot Bunuel&apos;s last three films and Le Proces (Welles, 1963), wasn&apos;t interviewed nor Fernando Rey. Another flaw is that Buñuel is made into a hero, while he made mistakes too: e.g. why was it that he never worked with Dali again after l&apos;Age d&apos;or? Wasn&apos;t that because of major differences in the visual ideas of Buñuel and Dali? The riot over l&apos;Age d&apos;or is illustrated though. I was delighted to see that the emphasis in this documentary is on Buñuel as a person and on his surrealist freedom. If you like one or more of the films by Buñuel, you will want to see this (twice).\n\n9/10"

Charlton Heston mentioned that this was his favorite film in which he appeared. Some, including Bruce Dern, say it is his best role. And yet, it is not one he is widely known for.\n\nRoger Ebert wrote, &quot;The admirable thing about the movie is its devotion to real life. These are the kind of people, we feel, who must really have inhabited the West: common, direct, painfully shy in social situations and very honest.&quot; This is true. This is not an action film, or a heist film, or anything that turns the West into mythology. It is everyday life.",

The series aimed at simple family entertainment for during the holiday season, but one wonders whether it had to be that simple as the story of part 3. Part 1 still had a decent story, from part 2 on the story material would be almost non existent. Part 2&apos;s story was already weaker than that of part 1, part 3&apos;s poor story subject is only how to get guests for the Pony Hotel. \n\nTo fill the time the theme &quot;Immenhof&quot; song is repeated a number of times; one would have expected that the composer would have come up with at least one alternative song by now. Hermann Leitner&apos;s direction is decent, but what could he have done more with the poor script material. As with the 2 other parts the main attraction lies within the cast: both Heid Brühl and Angelika Meissner whom in the 3 parts we have seen grown up from young girls to young women and Margarete Haagen and Paul Henckels.\n\nThere is another regular in this series who I did not mention in my reviews on the first 2 parts: Paul Klinger. But who cares about him?",

      "reviewBody": "The later American Pie movies are basically nothing like the earlier, classic, ones. They are cheap, fast, cash-ins, on the success and the name of the earlier movies and are incredibly simplistic and immature ones. However I won&apos;t deny that these sort of movies definitely have an audience out there. Teenagers will most probably still have fun with this movie, especially when they watch it with a couple of friends and a couple of cold ones, if they are old enough for that of course.\n\nReally when judging this movie seriously, there is very little positive to say about it. The story is all over the place and is being filled with some highly unlikely events and characters. Really, if all schools and fraternities were like this, society would have crumbled down by now. And it&apos;s also obviously not being very realistic and actually a quite annoying thing how all of the girls are perfectly pretty ones and the guys all are well toned and can basically get every willing girl with a snap of their finger. But lets hope that nobody has the illusion that these sort of movies portray anything out of the real life and tries to be like any of the characters out of this movie.\n\nYou could say that this movie serves its purpose well enough for the right audience but of course that just doesn&apos;t make this a good movie as well. But nevertheless, for what it is, it&apos;s still being a quite amusing movie, you just shouldn&apos;t think too much about while watching it. The movie didn&apos;t annoy me as much as the previous American Pie presents movie did but it&apos;s still being a pretty bad and definitely simplistic movie. \n\nThese sort of movies probably feel more like an extended television series episode, with only some more nudity added to it than anything else really. Which makes you think; why haven&apos;t they attempted it yet to make a television series out of the American Pie franchise? It&apos;s probably cheaper to do so and you can potentially reach a wider audience with as well. The American Pie series have reach a level by now that the characters and stories feel way more appropriate for television than movie really.\n\nSwitch your brain off, get drunk or just turn yourself into a young male teenager again, in order to get a maximum amount of fun out of this movie.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

The close-ups the film maker chose were familiar to those who love the subject&apos;s work and that of Chuck Close, one of the commentators. Alice Neel was actually a woman from an ordinary background, but this film pointed out the extraordinary contributions it&apos;s possible for such women to make. All it takes is the ability to recognize that no one can define you; Alice Neel was able to be a loving mother as well as an extraordinary artist. The work was close to the film maker, but it had the feeling of objectivity. I especially enjoyed the interaction between his father and the film maker and the scene of the grandmother and her grandson. Enjoy!",

The latter is in fact French playwright Robert Thomas&apos;s rather famous 8 Femmes which Francois Ozon many years later turned into almost a musical under its original title. The reviewer also refers to seven women but there are in fact eight.\n\nAmong Robert Thomas&apos;s most well-known plays count La Perruche et le Poulet (in Afrikaans as Babbelkous en Bruidegom); the play which Alfred Hitchcock bought but never filmed (although several other versions were made): Trap for a Lonely Man (also in Afrikaans as Lokval vir &apos;n Man Alleen); and of course Huit Femmes.\n\nFranz Marx directed a number of movies in die 1970s and 1980s and also made some serious art films for television such as Die Buitestaander (The Outsider) and &apos;n Lug Vol Helder Wolke (A Sky full of Clear Clouds) based on the novel by Karel Schoeman before he launched Afrikaans&apos;s most famous soapie Egoli.\n\nIn Netnou Hoor Die Kinders (careful, the children might hear) Marx used eight of the most famous and adept Afrikaans stage actresses and he exploited both the staginess of the play and the stagecraft of the actresses. Sometimes the characters are way over the top, which is exactly what is needed to create both comedic moments and suspense. There is hardly anything common about the setting, the costumes, the script and especially the language (no vulgarities or coarse words) but double entendres abound. Nearly every line of dialogue is yet another twist in the tale and sting in the tail.\n\nAlthough it certainly won&apos;t be regarded as either a classic or art, it still has great entertainment value, even more so for those of us fortunate enough to have experienced this bevy of actresses on the stage. They showed impeccable timing and in their continual one-upmanship never lost the tongue-in-cheek touch. And Marx directed with a deft hand."

They are airing a tape that has been found in a meteor crater labeled &quot;From Future.&quot; The titular &quot;Movie from the Future.&quot; The host of the show and various talking heads interrupt periodically to debate points such as where did this tape come from, what does it mean, is this a bad hoax, etc. The rest of the time you are treated to what amounts to a made-for-TV movie from beyond time. The plot revolves around Bonnie Johnson returning home to Earth during a semester break from college with her blue-nose alien beau Golonzo Arkanoid, Bonnie&apos;s father&apos;s disapproval, Golonzo&apos;s plan to conquer the Earth, the government robots tracking Golonzo, Bonnie&apos;s brother Armand and his dopey roommates (one of whom clones himself in a scheme to start selling clones... of himself), and much too much more to mention. It&apos;s chocked full of great moments of what the future could be like. Personally my favorite bit is the TV sitcom they watch in the future. This is a great low-budget/comedy/sci-fi/horror movie. A definite must see for people who love that genre! If you&apos;ve seen any other Amazing Schlock films (especially &quot;Hey, Stop Stabbing Me!&quot;) you&apos;ll know what kind of inspired wackiness to expect. If you haven&apos;t, you should really check it out. It&apos;s not a good as &quot;Aliens,&quot; but I&apos;m still going to give it five out of five face-huggers!",

The main character cuts a girl&apos;s head off and tosses it from a really tall height, and it lands on a guy and kills the guy. She must have had a REALLY hard head. Also, check out hilarious deaths involving chainsaws and lawnmowers and splattered entrails and the like.\n\nFor whatever reason, all the characters come back to life as ZOMBIES at the end... uh, yeah. If you&apos;re into serious horror films, you&apos;ll probably hate this. The movie is surprisingly NOT played for laughs, though it&apos;s way too ridiculous to take seriously most of the time... But, anyway, I liked this film a lot, and I think you will too.",

      "reviewBody": "Scary Movie 3 (2003) is a movie in my DVD collection that my wife and I recently rewatched on MAX. The storyline follows a family that live in a midwestern town that is experiencing crop circles and doesn&apos;t know if it&apos;s real or a hoax. Meanwhile, a single mom is raising a unique little boy who has unique visions and perspectives. As they both try to get to the root of their problems, they discover working together may help them get to the bottom of both family&apos;s issues...\n\nThis movie is directed by David Zucker (Ruthless People) and stars Anna Faris (House Bunny), Charlie Sheen (Major League), Regina Hall (Girls Trip), Pamela Anderson (Barb Wire), Jenny McCarthy (Dirty Love), Kevin Hart (Ride Along) and Anthony Anderson (The Departed).\n\nThis movie is way better than it gets credit for. This is a tremendous horror parody with a fun mashup of Sixth Sense and Signs (with a few others mixed in like The Ring). The acting is excellent and Charlie Sheen and Anna Faris are tremendous. The horror skits are awesome and the cameos thorough out are impressive. Kevin Hart, Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffin, George Carlin, Leslie Nielsen and Anthony Anderson all deliver strong cameos that are hilarious.\n\nOverall, the focus on M. Night Shyamalan, especially during this era, was brilliant. This is more creative than it gets credit for. I would score this a 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",

In need of artistic renewal, Steven Soderbergh threw everything he could think of into this self-financed feature and the results are scattershot, inscrutable, unfathomable and -- above all else -- hilarious.  Veering from biting social commentary to clever wordplay to a withering parody of Scientology, this film isn&apos;t the sort of thing one should rent unless you want to give your brain a workout.\n\nSoderbergh has said that this was his attempt to pay homage to the &quot;freewheeling&quot; style of Richard Lester.  Whether he achieves that or not is open to debate, but he certainly managed to create a one-of-a-kind film experience.  Too bad few people ever got the chance to see it on the big screen.\n\nIn the immortal words of Elmo Oxygen:  &quot;I believe -- so strongly -- in mayonnaise.&quot;  Words to live by.  I know I do.",

I guess I was dead wrong. The cover makes it look pretty good and then ...nope. I recommend Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2. Most of the time I just laughed, and not good laughter. Just because it was pathetic. It just goes to show that the cover of the DVD can really be deceiving. I don&apos;t think I will ever watch a Dante movie again. Don&apos;t waste your time.

Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period. It&apos;s sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai  also doesn&apos;t allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. A really lovely film. Just prepare yourself for the ending.",

The gang decide to go on their own, and not depend on Kermit so much. Meanwhile Kermit works in a diner, and try to get his play off the ground.\n\nThis starts off great with a lot of comedy from the whole gang. Dabney Coleman is great for some gut busting laughs. It&apos;s too bad that the gang is scattered after the start. Miss Piggy has some hilarious fun, but I prefer to have the whole gang together. They&apos;re funnier together.\n\nThe main live action lead is Juliana Donald who&apos;s trying to help Kermit get the play off the ground. She doesn&apos;t have any sparks, and looks awkward like she&apos;s acting with a bunch of puppets. There are a lot of famous cameos. I&apos;d prefer to have Brooke Shields as the lead. Beside that, there is a lot to love, and a lot of laughs in this Muppets movie.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie picks up where the previous film &quot;The Aztec Mummy&quot; left off with &quot;Dr. Krupp&quot; (Luis Aceves Castaneda) being interrogated by the police for his role as the criminal mastermind known as &quot;The Bat&quot;. His latest caper was attempting to steal an Aztec breastplate and bracelet in order to locate an ancient Aztec treasure. To do this he needed the services of &quot;Dr. Almada&quot; (Ramon Gay) and his pretty fiancé &quot;Flor Sepulveda&quot; (Rosa Arenas) and he had no concern about kidnapping or murdering them if that becomes necessary. Now, although he was arrested, he still desperately wants this treasure, and this movie essentially begins with him getting another chance when his men rescue him during a bloody shootout on the way to prison. Attempting to help the police is a masked man known as &quot;The Angel&quot; whose identity is best left secret so as not to spoil the film for those who haven&apos;t seen it. Be that as it may, for a sequel to a rather average movie this film wasn&apos;t too bad all things considered. While it features the same cast and manages to keep things rolling along, one specific complaint I had was that it didn&apos;t show as much of the Aztec mummy as I would have liked. Additionally, while it isn&apos;t necessary to see the first movie it certainly wouldn&apos;t hurt--if for no other reason than to have a bit more insight into what is going on. In any case, it wasn&apos;t quite as good as &quot;The Aztec Mummy&quot; and for that reason I have rated it one notch below it. Slightly below average.",

It&apos;s a lot like United 93 in that sense ... realistic, wrenching, and heartbreaking, but something you have to experience. It may be too visceral for critics (also like United 93), but film lovers should definitely seek it out. The ending is not supposed to be a surprise ... we know it is inevitable, and that creates a deep empathy for the character and the injustice she experiences. Yes there are more than a few flaws here. Sometimes the score becomes intrusive and there are some lines that don&apos;t work. But if audience involvement is any indication, this is an unqualified success.",

They need to comminicate with earth scientists about a planet on a runaway coarse about to collide with Earth.  The film is silly, completely without logic.\n\nWhat I sincerely love about this gem is the atmosphere.  Night skies alive with darting flying saucers are quite beautiful, the sort of postcard-look of the advancing burning planet is rather neat, and the staggering heatwave that hits a seemingly doomed Earth gets rather discomforting.  You&apos;ll giggle AT the film, but will be in awe WITH the film."

Then, while Carroll and the family negotiate the cost of her departure, she falls unexpectedly in love \n\nWell, make that expectedly &quot;The Devil&apos;s Holiday&quot; is a creaky, but worthwhile &quot;early talkie&quot; drama. First of all, it features Carroll&apos;s second-place finishing &quot;Academy Award&quot; performance as &quot;Best Actress&quot; (Norma Shearer won for her &quot;Divorcée&quot;). At the time, Carroll was a considered a &quot;new&quot; talking pictures star; in that respect, she was the first &quot;talkie&quot;-dominant actress to move in on the &quot;Quigley Poll&quot; top ten list of established &quot;silent&quot; stars. Carroll was #10 in 1929, and seemed assured of super-stardom with the new dramatic range she showed in &quot;Devil&apos;s Holiday&quot; (where she displayed real sweat and tears).\n\nHolmes is also at his best, playing the love-struck rich kid with wide-eyed innocence. And, he gets one of those great &quot;smacked on the staircase&quot; scenes. Holmes falls in love three times in this movie, but only for Nancy Carroll. She and Holmes had great chemistry, as you&apos;ll see; and, box office returns dictated they would be re-teamed fairly quickly (for the close to, but not quite &quot;Stolen Heaven&quot;). Writer/director Edmund Goulding manages well considering it was early 1930. You also get two pioneer players, Messrs. Kirkwood and Bosworth, in featured roles; and, the minor cast members are used very well.\n\n******* The Devil&apos;s Holiday (5/9/30) Edmund Goulding ~ Nancy Carroll, Phillips Holmes, James Kirkwood, Hobart Bosworth",

Blier cuts away from the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere, so we&apos;re never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way, that incident is the start of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay, although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want). The movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes, making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots, some of them are bound to hit.",

It&apos;s a revenge western, powerfully scripted by Philip Yordan and directed with commendable restraint by King. Gregory Peck, (at his most stoic), is the rancher bent on bringing to justice the four men he believes raped and killed his wife. The men are a leering Stephen Boyd, Albert Salmi, Henry Silva and an over-excitable Lee Van Cleef. Joan Collins, by this time entrenched in her first American sojourn, is in there, too, but she&apos;s the weakest thing in the film. There is a crisis of conscience and a spiritual reawakening to be reckoned with and the film does pose some interesting questions of morality but there&apos;s tension and the pleasures that come from a good western, as well. One for rediscovery.",

      "reviewBody": "Head On (Gegen die Wand), winner of the top prize &quot;Golden Bear&quot; at the 2004 Berlin Festival, is occasionally interrupted by a panoramic shot of a singer performing in front of a small Turkish orchestra on the banks of the Bosphorus across from Istanbul. It&apos;s a simple, at first incomprehensible, little device that provides punctuation and clarity amid the chaos and melodrama that otherwise dominate this story of a Turkish man in his forties and a twenty-year-old Turkish woman who meet in a psychiatric facility in Germany when both have attempted suicide -- he by crashing his car into a wall (&quot;head on&quot;), she by slitting her wrists. Cahit Tomruk (the sublimely attitudinizing Birol Ünel) is a purposeless rock &apos;n&apos; roll loving boozer with a dead-end job collecting bottles at a club, and Sibel Güner (the wiry, intense Sibel Kikulli) is a young woman with conservative Turkish parents who wants to escape family pressures.\n\nBoth are total drama queens and both are German-born Turks. Cahit is more assimilated; his Turkish isn&apos;t even good. Sibel figures if he&apos;ll agree to marry her that&apos;ll get her away from her family. This is the irony of their situation: she must capitulate to the conventions of their culture in order to gain some freedom from it, and he must capitulate to society in order to get some sense of purpose. So they do get married -- he somehow passes muster with the stuffy family, baulking all the way -- and they eventually even fall in love. Her joie de vivre is exactly what he needs, and she&apos;s essentially just as wild in her way as he is in his -- but his nihilism and violence continue unabated and so does her promiscuity, and his brutal attack on one of her one night stands leads to jail and scandal, which in turn forces her to go to Istanbul. While he&apos;s incarcerated she writes him sustaining letters from Turkey -- their relationship, like the staid orchestra on the Bosphorus, is a stable element amid the surrounding chaos -- and after jail he goes to Turkey to find her.\n\nTo say this turbulent, brightly colored, lurid story is a &quot;realistic picture of Turks in Germany&quot; would be a total distortion of the truth. But somehow the situation of Cahit and Sibel reflects the unstable moods this half assimilated, half alien population experiences, and however melodramatic and unresolved the saga is, the two main characters are very well realized. The actors are strong, especially Birol Ünel, whose charismatic brooding and ravaged good looks make him irresistibly watchable. Both feel real to us -- he sardonic and gloomy, she dangerously spirited and full of life-- despite her dramatic suicide attempts, of which there&apos;s more than one. The story, as much as the images through which it&apos;s told, is both dark and vibrant.\n\nWe need the Brechtian, Greek-chorus device of those orchestral interludes on the Bosphorus, though: without an occasional break the drama and darkness would be too much. We also need to go with the flow of this movie, and not expect it to be more polished or more organized, or even better looking, than it is. It looks unlike most films we&apos;re seeing now, but that doesn&apos;t mean the cinematographer hasn&apos;t done the best possible job. What it has is life, tumultuous with incident, strong personalities, and a milieu we&apos;ve not seen before. There&apos;s also a loud, authentic-feeling rock-pop soundtrack and a cunning contrast between Cahit&apos;s punk-rock sensibility and Sibel&apos;s love of good grooming and dance. Arguably the movie is too long, but that length gives it the feel of a saga, which it must have, because that&apos;s what it is, the confused, tawdry epic of a generation. Like all first films by a whole subculture, it has a lot to talk about. When Sibel and Cahit discover they still love each other, after everything, it&apos;s the Turkish Germans discovering that they have self-worth. The last scenes are open-ended: this generation&apos;s future is anybody&apos;s guess.\n\nSeen in Paris 17 September 2004. Opening in the US in January 2005. First German film to win a Golden Bear in Berlin in eighteen years."

      "reviewBody": "...because the comedy must be funny yet the horror must be, well, horrible! This film manages to do both. The art designer was somewhat confused because although most of the fashions and all of the autos are 1920&apos;s vintage, some of the houses are decorated in early 70s style. The story is actually taking place in the 1920s.\n\nThe storyline opens with inspector Trout of Scotland Yard noticing that two surgeons have very recently died in odd ways - one killed by bats, another by bees. His boss basically tells him - poppycock! Don&apos;t waste your time on this. But then a third is killed by strangulation via a mask at a costume ball and he is sure something is up. His assistant finds the link between the three - Dr. Vasalius (Joseph Cotton). They visit him, and even while they are there a fourth doctor dies, also a former associate of Vasalius. Vasalius finds the link between the five of them in his case history files. They all worked on one case together -that of Victoria Phibes, who died on the operating table. Could it be her husband doing all of this? No, he died in a fiery auto crash in Switzerland racing to get back to England when he heard of his wife&apos;s illness. With no children and no surviving relatives, everybody is stumped.\n\nWell, the audience sees who is doing this all along. It is Vincent Price in a diabolically campy performance as Dr. Phibes, out to avenge his wife&apos;s death. He is mute throughout the film - well, that is, his lips never move. He is assisted by someone else who is completely mute. Although she is never called by name anywhere she is credited as Vulnavia and given big credits as &quot;Introducing Virginia North&quot;. Funny thing is, this was her last credited acting role! Vulnavia&apos;s fashion sense is one reason I was confused about the time period. She looks like a model circa 1970. Well, she actually WAS a fashion model circa 1970. Vulnavia is a beautiful girl who never speaks and seems to follow Phibes&apos; every command even without him telling her what to do, all this for a bizarre recluse obsessed with his dead wife. The question never answered is WHY?\n\nWell, there are lots of questions here, just don&apos;t let them get in the way of the fun because the outrageous impossibility of Phibes succeeding and the passivity of his victims, some of whom just sit and stare at him while he kills them in odd ways when just running away would thwart his plans, are part of the reason that this is a comedy. Then there is poor inspector Trout whose assistants are named Bass, Carp, and Bream. So this is being played as a farce right down to the names of the cops out to solve the murder.\n\nYou can watch it late at night or alone. It won&apos;t actually scare you, but you might feel like a bad person for laughing just a bit. Especially at the end when you finally get to hear Vulnavia&apos;s voice - screaming. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "WEE WILLIE WINKIE (20th Century-Fox, 1937), directed by Academy Award winning John Ford, stars Shirley Temple in possibly her most prestigious film of her career. Capitalizing on the current trend of military themes as THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (Paramount, 1935), THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (Warners, 1936), and later the most popular, Rudyard Kipling&apos;s GUNGA DIN (RKO, 1939), WEE WILLIE WINKIE, also authored by Kipling, fits well into this category. In spite of Temple&apos;s presence, high production values, fine support of Academy Award winning actor Victor McLaglen (RKO&apos;s THE INFORMER, 1935), and a well-scripted but leisurely-paced screenplay (by Ernest Pascal and Julian Josephson), WEE WILLIE WINKIE comes close to being overlooked item from cinema history.\n\nWith Temple&apos;s previous screen efforts typically casting her as an orphan or child of a widowed parents who occupies screen time solving problems with feel good intervals of song and dance, WEE WILLIE WINKIE is a welcome change of pace. While Temple doesn&apos;t have any real musical interludes, she does acquire one heartfelt moment worth mentioning where she sings &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; to a dying soldier. Of her two 1937 releases, HEIDI, based on the literary work by Johanna Spyri, appears to be most admired mainly because it gears mostly towards the interest of children while WEE WILLIE WINKIE appears to be more of a story for adults. Being the longest (99 minutes, though road show version was reportedly at 105 minutes) of Temple&apos;s feature length films of the 1930s, WEE WILLIE WINKIE contains more ingredients of a John Ford movie than Temple&apos;s. Regardless, the chemistry of both blends in nicely into the scenario. Temple would work under Ford again in FORT APACHE (RKO, 1948) with McLaglen in the supporting cast.   \n\nPlot summary: The year is 1897. Joyce Williams (June Lang), a young widow unable to support herself and her daughter, Priscilla (Shirley Temple), in America, are sent by her father-in-law, Colonel Williams, to live with him on his British Army Base. Arriving by train to Raj Pore station in Northern India, they are greeted by Sergeant McDuff (Victor McLaglen) to escort them via coach to their destination. Before departure, Priscilla witnesses the arrest of Khonda Khan (Cesar Romero), the rebel leader responsible for the smuggling of guns belonging to her grandfather&apos;s regiment. Having dropped his sacred charm, Priscilla runs over return &quot;the necklace&quot; back to him. Khan, dangerous and handcuffed, shows gratitude towards this &quot;strange child&quot; as he is taken away by authorities. During her stay at the post, Priscilla meets Branders (Michael Whalen), a young lieutenant she calls &quot;Coppy&quot; (whose hair, as she described, shines like a copper penny). Feeling her grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith) doesn&apos;t like her McDuff, at Coppy&apos;s request, shows Priscilla the procedures on becoming a good soldier. Providing her a junior-sized uniform, much to the dismay of drummer boy, Mott (Douglas Scott), McDuff renames his little soldier, &quot;Wee Willie Winkie.&quot; With an uprising leading to the prison escape of Khonda Khan and the death of Sergeant McDuff, war is officially declared, causing &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot; to try and make peace before any more men are killed.\n\nWhile Temple dealt with grumpy grandfathers before, Lionel Barrymore being her best encounter in THE LITTLE COLONEL (1935), C. Aubrey Smith fits the bill as her military-minded grandfather with little time for his grandchild. Cesar Romero, believable as Konda Khan, gives a remarkable performance. He would assume another recognizable, but less threatening role, opposite Temple once more in THE LITTLE PRINCESS (1939). Military formation and the lives of British soldiers take precedence over the romantic subplot between June Lang and Michael Whalen that has been kept to a minimum. Others in the cast include Constance Collier (Mrs. Allardyce); Lauri Beatty (Elsa Allardyce, her daughter); Willie Fung (Mohammed Dihn); Brandon Hurst (Bagby); Lionel Pape (Major Allardyce); Mary Forbes (Mrs. MacMonachie), and John Ford regular, Jack Pennick, as one of the soldiers.\n\nA successful film in its day, WEE WILLIE WINKIE was later reissued at 77 minutes, the print most commonly used on commercial television prior to 1985. It wasn&apos;t until around 1987 when WEE WILLIE WINKIE was available close to its theatrical length when distributed on home video. In recent years, the 99 minute version became available on numerous cable stations, including The Disney Channel (colorized, 1990s); American Movie Classics (1996-2000), The Fox Movie Channel and Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: July 13, 2015). It&apos;s availability on DVD contains the choice of both colorized and black and white formats.\n\nWhile Temple may seem to be an unlikely candidate on a military base in far away India wanting to become a good little soldier, she&apos;s certainly one who hasn&apos;t lost her appeal in the rank as &quot;Wee Willie Winkie.&quot; (***1/2)",

I had never heard of Metamorphosis The Alien Factor but coming across a article in an old Dark Side Magazine I was surprised by the pictures. It looked like they used great effects. And by watching it, they did. It starts great with the breaking out of some alien virus attacking people working in the lab. One of them transforms into a weird creature but the transformation or metamorphosis was really well done. It even reminded me of The Thing when some tentacles appeared out of the victims body. It wasn&apos;t gory but the red stuff do flows a lot. But as I said it was campy too. The words sometimes said were really laughable sometimes. And when you saw a flesh eating plant moving or one of the creatures it was a bit of a laugh, but the dog was again really well done and face it, no CGI was used, just the good old latex and even some stop motion.\n\nEverybody was talking about Tara Leigh being in this flick but for me the face of Dianna Flaherty rang a bell. She was in some Troma productions (Class Of Nuke&apos;em High and Toxic Avenger). The acting was okay and by some mediocre.\n\nThe look of the flick itself looked like a eighties production and being made in the nineties it couldn&apos;t deliver the effects used then due being a low budget. But I enjoyed it a lot, man, the changing into the creature and the face changing towards the end, I loved it. The alien factor really did it for me, what a metamorphosis.",

At first glance you may think the plot line is cliché and overly simplistic, and you may be right, but it is the way the story is told, the setting, and the great performance from Guy Pearce that will really suck you in and have you thinking about this movie for long after it is over. This is the kind of movie that is good for multiple viewings. Even though i&apos;ve only seen it once, im sure you would pick up more bits and pieces form watching it a second time around. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys physchological thrillers that make you think. This is not for action junkies that can&apos;t enjoy a movie unless it layed out in front of them.",

It was a wonderful movie, and I suggest it to all who are able to get the opportunity to watch it. It has a wonderful cast, wonderful writing, direction is done well, and Ms. West is at her finest. She is absolutely stunning to say the least. This is one of those movies that will give you a belly laugh. Hope you all go down and try to find some of her wonderful work. She was a great writer, and actress, and did so much for women writers in her day and today.",

I enjoy a good thoughtful film as much as the next stuck-up film snob, but I also love damned good action flicks. \n\nTwister is a big dumb summer blockbuster with no pretensions whatsoever. I *like* the fact that the money is all up there on the screen - lots of tornadoes ripping apart farmhouses and throwing trucks around. I *like* that it&apos;s one long chase movie. I *like* looking at Helen Hunt&apos;s beautiful face. I saw Twister twice at the cinema, and at least three times since - and I&apos;ve enjoyed it every single time. Can you get a better recommendation than that?\n\nTwister will never satisfy some people... in particular, those who watch it, for some strange reason, expecting a cerebral masterpiece. Enjoy it for what it is: One of the best summer blockbusters ever."

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie on TNT after being intrigued by the lackluster comments from reviewers. I typically like James Garner movies. After seeing the movie, I saw it as a religious allegory. James Garner plays Everyman who was searching to answer the question &quot;Who am I?&quot; During the movie, I realized that he asks that question rather than the question &quot;What is my name?&quot; He is asking an ontological question.\n\nFurthermore, there are two scenes where he refers to the deity. In the first scene, where he is youthfully impetuous, he refers to &quot;all the gods of the earth and cosmos&quot; or something. In the latter reference to deity, he soberly and humbly refers to &quot;God.&quot; This reference occurs after an intervening scene of a flashback where he tells his young wife that he loves perfection that he finds in music. He then hears Bach&apos;s Requiem Mass; they enter a church and stand before an altar. This is an example of how knowledge of nature can lead to God. As the flashbacks bring back more of his life, Garner matures as finally realizes his current, wretched condition.\n\nThe final scene is quite touching. He finds life through grace. Of course, Grace is his wife&apos;s name but the scene allegorically refers to the &quot;saving grace.&quot; The movie is not a typical amnesia movie. It is disjointed and the dialog stilted, but, like a classical painting, many scenes have meaning when viewed from a religious viewpoint. Perhaps seeing this viewpoint requires knowledge of Christian doctrine. I would&apos;ve ordered it on DVD, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be available.",

      "name": "The Story of Little Muck",
      "reviewBody": "&apos;Little Muck&apos; is one of Wilhelm Hauff&apos;s most famous fairy tales and has been adapted a few times. It is charming enough with a likeable titular character and interesting thematically, but is very slight and one of those stories that lends itself better to a short film or 20-30 minute television episode from personal opinion. As far as Hauff&apos;s fairytales go, there is a vast personal preference for &apos;The Cold Heart&apos;, which is even more interesting from a psychological standpoint and has much more to it.\n\nThat fairytale/story was also adapted three years earlier in 1950 in East Germany distributed by DEFA. Found that film vastly superior, partly because of the story itself, but also because it did better at respecting its source material, took it more seriously and the characters in general are more memorable. &apos;The Story of Little Muck&apos; is still worth seeing though, and is enough to make one feel why there aren&apos;t any more older East German fantasy/fairy-tale films and why those that exist aren&apos;t better known regardless of their overall quality. &apos;The Story of Little Muck&apos; is one of the most popular and successful of them, but for me while it is not a terrible film and did like it better than the other commentators (respectfully, do share their flaws though) other films of theirs have held up much better.\n\nWill start with the good things. It still looks pretty great now, which is amazing considering there are many fantasy/fairy-tale films made later that look nowhere near as good, cheap-looking even. It may not be flashy or big in spectacle, the budget and technology being not as advanced at the time, but the story didn&apos;t call for that and appreciated that it wasn&apos;t overblown and didn&apos;t rely too much on effects at the expense of everything else. The production design is suitably rustic and colourful and didn&apos;t look simplistic, while it is beautifully shot in colour that never looked too drab or garishly gaudy. Any effects aren&apos;t overused or abused.\n\nOther DEFA films have music scores that stick in the mind more, but the music doesn&apos;t make the mistakes of being intrusive, too loud, monotonous, over-used, cheap-sounding, juxtaposing too much mood-wise that it doesn&apos;t fit or too much of its time that it dates the film. Nice score on the whole. Little Muck is as likeable as he should be, always relate to his type of characters, as is Hassan. There is charm and imagination when it did get going, though not enough, Thomas Schmidt is appealing as Muck and the ending rounds things off nicely.\n\nConversely, &apos;The Story of Little Muck&apos; is one that doesn&apos;t really lend itself to a feature film. It is too slight and the film does try to stretch scenes out to fill out the running time (which is not that long really, but in context of this film it felt too long) and the film feels over-stretched as a result. This affects the pace which is very uneven, sometimes perfect but at other points dull, if it got going quicker for example that would have improved it.\n\nDo agree that the comedy is too broad and actually consider a lot of the acting on the wrong side of theatrical, especially the villains. Outside of Little Muck and Hassan, also didn&apos;t connect with the characters, all of which bland and broadly acted. The blandness and lack of naturalness is present in the writing. The direction is competent but not much more than that.\n\nIn conclusion, above average but couldn&apos;t help feeling disappointed because the East German fairy/folk-tale films have been a more than worthwhile experience for me. 5.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Conflating the Western, horror and teenage movie genres as it does, &quot;Teenage Monster&quot; (1957) is a unique experience indeed. It also features the most frightening monster in a late 1800s Western setting since Mercedes McCambridge stalked through the plains of &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954). In this film, a meteor that looks like a July 4th sparkler crashes near the mine of the Cannon family, killing Paw and turning young Charles into a mutant of sorts. Seven years later, Charles is the eponymous teenage monster, killing cattle and the occasional passerby, while his Maw must hide him from the townsfolk and deal with her new blackmailing hussy of a housekeeper. Charles, as a teenager, looks like nothing more than a long-haired and long-bearded hippie with bad teeth (I&apos;ve seen worse walking the streets of the East Village!), despite the makeup work by Jack &quot;Frankenstein&quot; Pierce. His garbled, whining attempts at speech are reminiscent of a constipated canine and are quite pathetic, but still had me cracking up somehow. Anne Gwynne, who was featured in any number of 1940s Universal horror films, is fine as Charles&apos; sacrificing mother, and, actually, their relationship is kinda sweet. Still, the film, fun as it is, is patently ridiculous, and with a very rushed ending to boot. Even my revered &quot;Psychotronic Encyclopedia&quot; calls it &quot;awful.&quot; My tastes must be getting more and more dubious, though, because I did have a good time with this unique little quickie.",

      "reviewBody": "The Dark Mirror is directed by Robert Siodmak and adapted to screenplay by Nunnally Johnson from a story by Vladimir Pozner. It stars Olivia de Havilland, Lew Ayres, Thomas Mitchell, Richard Long and Charles Evans. Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Milton Krasner.\n\nA man appears to have been murdered by one of the identical twin Collins sisters, but both of whom have an alibi. The police and the psychiatrist have their work cut out...\n\nStraight out of the corner of postwar Hollywood that began to take fascination with mental illness, The Dark Mirror triumphs more as a technical exercise than as anything resembling thought provoking analysis. The simplistic Freudian elements aside, film is impressively mounted and performed by Siodmak and de Havilland respectively. Story follows the trajectory of a cat-and-mouse game, with the makers nicely putting us the viewers into the same struggle the authorities have in sussing out which sister is the damaged killer.\n\nSiodmak&apos;s (The Spiral Staircase) attention to detail and grasp of mood setting really lifts the piece to greater heights. Aided by the considerable photographic skills of Krasner (The Set-Up), Siodmak creates a world of psychological disturbance, a place aligned with suspense and symbolism. Right from the doozy of an opening scene to the denouement, Siodmak manages to keep the contrivances to the rear of the play and let de Havilland and the visual textures be the prime focus.\n\nThe effects work is very good, with de Havilland having to quite often play off against herself. Sure in today&apos;s age of High Definition et al, you don&apos;t have to stretch your viewing experience to see how the effects were done, but why would you? Just enjoy de Havillland&apos;s riveting performances in the dual roles (see also her excellence in The Snake Pit two years later), her skillful little subtleties as she deftly plays out the respective psychological traits of sibling rivalry gone astray.\n\nIs it a gimmick movie? Well no not really, it&apos;s honest about what it wants to achieve in terms of psychiatric observations and treatments. Yet lesser lights than Siodmak, Krasner and de Havilland would have struggled to make it work, especially as the romance angle in the screenplay nearly derails the requisite mood come the finale. Thankfully, in spite of some obvious negatives, it&apos;s still well worthy of viewing investment. 7/10",

In the mix are Communists, terrorists, the C.I.A.(as represented by John Phillip Law), and the national army. The two American characters (Lewis Van Bergen and the previously-mentioned Wilson) are really obnoxious, &quot;wisecrack&quot; even when they are being tortured, and are supposedly &quot;macho&quot; guys, although the end result of their characterizations is anything BUT &quot;macho.&quot; (Please note the scene where the two are practically &apos;cuddling&quot; on the floor when they are being held prisoner about a third of the way through the film. Their &quot;American abroad&quot; attitude is incredibly condescending to Latino culture; in that, these two morons might remind Eurotrash fans of the idiotic pair of heroes in the Kommisar X films of the 60&apos;s.)\n\nAnyhow, this film is only 81 minutes long on the VHS copy I paid a buck for; even that, though, seemed like an eternity.",

      "reviewBody": "I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss&apos; classic, &quot;How The Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss&apos; story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.\n\nBecause the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch&apos;s cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.\n\nAs far as the quality of the film goes, it&apos;s a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn&apos;t thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn&apos;t what you&apos;d want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too &apos;normal&apos; a voice for a character such as the Grinch.\n\nOverall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer.",

However, I simply love the adorable Natassja Kinski, one of the most beautiful actresses of the cinema industry. &quot;À ton Image&quot; is not so bad for a Christopher Lambert&apos;s movie, but something is missing to be a good film. The idea of a sterile woman with a guilty complex for the loss of her unique son and submitted to a cloning experience, and her beloved daughter being an evil replica of her, is excellent and updated. Unfortunately, the direction is too cold, without feelings, and in the end this movie is only reasonable. Anyway I think it deserves to be watched at least once. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Clone&quot; (&quot;The Clone&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "What do you want in a foreign period film? Beautiful locations? Check. Class struggle? Check. Subtitles? Check. All that&apos;s missing is urgency.\n\nCoco Chanel is a French legend. The designer of the ground-breaking haute couture style, creator of the huge fashion brand Chanel, and a forward-thinker in terms of women&apos;s independence. Chanel is a complex and dynamic personality. Makes me want to see a movie called &quot;Coco During Chanel&quot;. But &quot;Coco Before Chanel&quot;? Not so much.\n\nAudrey Tautou does a commendable job of playing Chanel in her early years (and looks a lot like Chanel in the movie&apos;s later scenes). Adding complications to the idea is the fact that there is little known about Chanel&apos;s youth, and what is known often has conflicting stories. But be prepared, what does happen in &quot;Coco Before Chanel&quot;, happens slowly. This, in a movie that portrays the French elite as people with crazy money, outlandish parties and a constant desire to quench their boredom. I desired the same.\n\nAlthough she often denied it, Chanel was brought to an orphanage early in life (this was denied mainly to prevent preconceptions of her as an undesirable). The film sharply cuts to late teens/early twenties Coco (real name, Gabrielle), singing with her sister in clubs to make a buck. It was the plight of women in the 1890s to find a man or fear being lost in society. Coco&apos;s sister was beholden to a man for thirty years, and he FINALLY married her after his parents died so he wouldn&apos;t have to explain to them that he married an orphan (for shame!). This assnine mentality is certainly worth rebelling against, but Coco remains passive for too much of the movie. She is taken in by a wild playboy named Balsan (expertly played by Benoit Poelvoorde) and is mistreated by him for years. Chanel wants to answer to no man and wants to design clothes that avoid the feathers and corset that alter a woman&apos;s natural body. But again, this is done with little dramatic flair and many, many pages of slow-moving script. Coco came off as a little too inert for a little too long.\n\nThis movie is the first of the late-year potential Oscar nominees. Tautou&apos;s performance is a maybe, but the costume design is a sure thing, and rightfully so. The Chanel style is famous, they have to nail it, and they did, while also building gorgeous period outfits for the rich, end-of-century French culture and a few military outfits as well.\n\nThe score by Alexandre Desplat does a lot to enhance a few of the scenes, and the cinematography is lush. I want to give a special nod to Alessandro Nivola, who&apos;s very good here and very good in everything, but the guy doesn&apos;t appear in enough high-profile stuff. He sits very comfortably in the French language here and smolders in some of his more romantic moments like a poor man&apos;s Ralph Fiennes.\n\nA traumatic event late in the film propels Coco to launch into her designing full speed. That moment felt a little rushed and the whole ending follows suit. What I wanted at the end was the &quot;Coco During Chanel&quot; movie to start, so, then, that could be kind of a success for the film? But remember, I wanted &quot;Coco During Chanel&quot; going in, so really, the whole &apos;before&apos; story just felt like slow filler. Frills, perhaps? Padding?",

      "reviewBody": "After a film star is killed in a car crash, insurance investigator Jeff Keenan (Rod Cameron) is dispatched to get to the bottom of the death. Upon arrival in the south of France, Keenan discovers that others have died, and may be linked to his company&apos;s client. This might have something to do with a certain psychiatric clinic.\n\nTHE ELECTRONIC MONSTER has no &quot;monsters&quot; in the literal sense. Instead, it has psychiatrists / scientists messing around with the human brain in order to relieve patients of their anxiety. Oddly, this has something to do with implanting images of semi-erotic, modern dance routines!\n\nOf course, this isn&apos;t a good idea, and leads to horrific results. In addition, a nefarious cabal is at work behind the scenes with an unsavory agenda.\n\nThis isn&apos;t a bad movie, and it&apos;s a shame it&apos;s been almost totally forgotten. The plot is interesting, and the movie could be remade. It&apos;s the sort of raw material that would make for a tremendous David Cronenberg film. Until then, it&apos;s enjoyable enough..."

      "reviewBody": "In 1972, Ginny Fiennes envisioned an incredible expedition: a longitudinal circumnavigation of the Earth, using only surface transport and following the Greenwich Meridian. It was a dangerous undertaking no-one had attempted before, and few would be brave or mad enough to try. Luckily for her, Ginny happened to know the perfect candidate for the job: her husband, noted adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes. After years of careful planning, the so-called Transglobe Expedition began, with the team- consisting of the two Fienneses, their dog Bothie, Oliver Shepard and Charles Burton- setting off from London in 1979; not to return until 1982. As they battled the elements across continents, the team inspired millions with their courage; securing for themselves places in the annals of history&apos;s greatest explorers to boot.\n\nDirected by William Kronick, &apos;To the Ends of the Earth&apos; is an inspiring documentary detailing the expedition, with narration provided by Richard Burton throughout. A riveting watch from start to finish, the film is a fascinating account of travel and adventure, through lands rarely captured on screen. As well as being a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit, the film also provides audiences with a biographical history of Sir Fiennes&apos; life and achievements, while also highlighting how integral Ginny was both to him and his adventures. Without her masterminding the endeavors, manning the radio equipment back in their makeshift HQ and tending to all manner of other duties, the expeditions that made her husband so famous would have never occurred. In this way, &apos;To the Ends of the Earth&apos; functions as a love story of kindred souls who supported each other no matter what, through thick and thin.\n\nTogether in life and love since they were mere children, Ran- as he likes to be known- and Ginny come across as intelligent, good-humored, endlessly likable folk for whom personal wealth and fame is immaterial. &apos;To the Ends of the Earth&apos; shows us how they spent years securing nearing 30 million pounds in funding for the expedition, living hand to mouth; focused entirely on their shared goal. Alongside Burton, Shepard and little Bothie, they endured countless hardships in their quest to traverse the globe, from tsetse flies to frostbite and everything in-between. Driven by a desire for knowledge and the spirit of adventure, their mission captured the hearts and minds of an entire nation; and continues to inspire millions to persevere, no matter how great the odds.\n\n&apos;To the Ends of the Earth&apos; features stunning cinematography that lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. From the biting desert sands of the Sahara, to the vast wilderness of ice in Antarctica and the tumultuous waters of the Northwest Passage, the photography is continuously epic in scale and scope throughout the Fiennes&apos; 37,000 mile journey. That the team handled the camera-work makes the images even more incredible, considering they were captured whilst in a race against time to complete the expedition on schedule.\n\nA fantastic documentary showcasing the power of perseverance, &apos;To the Ends of the Earth&apos; should be sought out by anyone even vaguely interested in exploring. Informative, tense and thrilling, the film details the true grit of the Transglobe teammates, who- against overwhelming odds- rose to meet every challenge that fate threw their way. Featuring spirited narration from Richard Burton and stunning cinematography on countless continents, William Kronick&apos;s account of Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes&apos; Transglobe Expedition &apos;To the Ends of the Earth&apos; is enthralling, entertaining and endlessly inspirational.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Drugstore Cowboy&apos; really knocked my socks off when I first watched it about 12-13 years ago, and it still impresses me every time I view it again. An unsentimental drug movie that doesn&apos;t resort to knee jerk moralizing, it is one of the very best movies of the 1980s, and still one of the best movies of its kind (Alison Maclean&apos;s underrated &apos;Jesus&apos; Son&apos; is one of the few recent movies to come close to it). Gus Van Sant looked like he was going to be one of the most exciting directors of the 1990s, but after the excellent &apos;My Own Private Idaho&apos; it quickly proved not to be so, his career ending up with awful saccharine &quot;uplifting&quot; Hollwood dreck and his misguided remake of &apos;Psycho&apos; that&apos;s best if we pretend never happened.  Whatever he went on to make there&apos;s no denying that this is one brilliant movie. Matt Dillon gives one of his strongest and most complex performances, and he is backed up by an equally impressive supporting cast of Kelly Lynch (easily her best role), the wonderful James LeGros (&apos;Floundering&apos;), future sex symbol Heather Graham (&apos;Boogie Nights&apos;), and quirky character actor fave Max Perlich (&apos;Truth Or Consequences, NM&apos;). Also keep an eye out for the shoulda-been-a-star James Remar (&apos;The Warriors&apos;) and a cameo by the legendary William S. Burroughs as &quot;the Priest&quot;. &apos;Drugstore Cowboy&apos; has energy, humour, depth and honesty. I love it. A wonderful movie and highly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "It is understandable that many take issue with Vampyr due to an absence of conventional moviemaking factors that make an average film watchable. However, I believe that this is more a problem of the viewer than one with the filmmaker, and it all begins with whether or not one watches expecting to be frightened in a generic horror flick manner. This is not a scary movie; it is one that fundamentally blurs the lines between dreams and reality.  It is not a silent film or a talkie, but something in between, and that fits in perfectly with the idea of it being an experience much like a bad dream. There are few professional actors (two, in fact, and neither would be considered the leading actors), and long takes that would drive a Hollywood film editor to distraction.  They are selected more for their appearance and natural manner than for any exceptional gift as an actor/actress, and it is my belief that that adds more than detracts from the experience.  The reactions of the characters are far more visceral and simple than in most films of this depth, and it helps create the mesmerizing, hypnotic effect few movies can create. It is designed, I believe, to be seen in a dark room, preferably alone and late at night, just prior to going to bed.  If the viewer is a little sleepy, so much the better: for the true power of the film will only be revealed as you dwell on it afterwards while you struggle to go to sleep.  Then,and only then, will the full might of Carl Theodore Dreyer&apos;s vision be revealed."

      "reviewBody": "Even when matched up against his Oscar-winning 1992 film UNFORGIVEN, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES must rank as being among Clint Eastwood&apos;s finest turns both in front of and behind the camera. Having displayed a solid feel for the director&apos;s chair with 1971&apos;s PLAY MISTY FOR ME and 1973&apos;s HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, Eastwood took the reins on JOSEY WALES when he and the original director Philip Kaufman, who still shared a co-write of the script (and had directed 1972&apos;s THE GREAT NORTHFIELD, MINNESOTA RAID), ran into some pretty strong disagreements. The end result was one of the best westerns of the 1970s, in critical, commercial, and artistic terms.\n\nEastwood&apos;s character is a farmer living out a quiet life in Missouri near the end of the Civil War who is forced to see his whole family and homestead wiped out by marauding &quot;Redlegs&quot; from Kansas. He joins up with a guerrilla band of Southerners to &quot;set things aright.&quot; But when the Union betrays those same guerrillas into surrendering and then promptly slaughters all of them, Eastwood takes violent revenge. He soon finds himself of the run at the reluctant hands of his former commander (John Vernon), and a determined Union man named Terrill (Bill McKinney, who played one of the sadistic mountain men in DELIVERANCE). As he heads towards Texas, he encounters a motley group of outcasts (Chief Dan George; Sondra Locke; Paula Trueman), and becomes less obsessed by violent revenge and more interested in helping, going for his guns only when McKinney&apos;s Union troop closes in, and bounty hunters come looking for him.\n\nIn contrast to the &quot;Man With No Name&quot; persona he codified with Sergio Leone in the 1960s, or the tough cop he personified in DIRTY HARRY, Eastwood&apos;s Josey Wales is a man of great courage and sympathy who becomes tired of all the violence he has had to see and to take part in. The vengeance motif is largely played out by the time the film is into its second half, and it only comes back towards the tail end for a brief moment. Those who have tagged Eastwood as a political reactionary, a John Wayne of our time, have certainly misjudged him, as even one viewing of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES will testify to. He is not interested in being tough for the sake of being tough; he just wants to survive, and he wants those he protects to be able to live in peace. That&apos;s why, although the film is unavoidably violent at times, it has a considerable humanity too, and why it remains one of Eastwood&apos;s finest films even to this day.",

And Elliott Dexter as &apos;Black&apos; Brown. The story line goes as Jenny is sent west to live with her uncle after the death of her father. In the meantime her uncle has been killed by Indians and Black Brown as assumed his identity They both make it to Strawberry Flats a gold rush town. Jenny makes it to Blacks cabin and knows he is not her uncle well they fall in love and the law catches up to Black the rest is to be watched.\n\nIt is good to see Pickford play a real woman in a film and she really makes this movie worth watching. Also Dexter does a good job of acting as does the rest of the ensemble. The real downfall of the film is the implausibility of the story line along with an unbelievable ending. It is nice to see Big Basin State Park used for the exterior shots this is one of the loveliest places in all of California, Grade C",

      "reviewBody": "As has been pointed out by other reviewers, this story is a new spin on &quot;The Prince and the Pauper.&quot; It actually reminded me, however, of the American movie &quot;Dave,&quot; in that the protagonist is a naive pawn whose empathy allows him to rise to the occasion, including finding love in the chaos.\n\nByung-hun Lee is simply an amazing actor. Having seen his &quot;dark&quot; side in movies like &quot;A Bittersweet Life&quot; and &quot;I Saw the Devil,&quot; I was very pleased to see he could handle the role of Ha-Seon with such a light touch. It was a joy to see him effortlessly shift from hilarious toilet humor to inspiring leader. I was particularly struck with the scenes where he interacted with commoners, in which I really felt the empathy Ha-Seon felt for them.\n\nThis is the first of director Chang-min Choo&apos;s movies I&apos;ve seen, and I was impressed at how he was able to seamlessly balance the light and serious scenes in the movies. To often, one or the other seems forced, but here Choo creates a character who grows and changes, but still remains, at heart, the same, good person he was at the beginning -- the kind of person who, by the end of the story, could be happy and believable as a king or a pauper. I think Choo also gave the movie a more intimate feel by focusing on one-on-one conversations and limiting the normal &quot;cast of thousands&quot; you often see in period pieces about kings.\n\nOverall, the acting was top notch -- particularly from Hyo-ju Han as the Queen and Hyo-ju Han as Minister Do -- and the costumes and set design were beautiful.\n\nMasquerade is an engaging and charming period piece with humor, action, and romance.",

      "reviewBody": "Billy Wilder goes back to Berlin after the war and doesn&apos;t like it much. If you&apos;re expecting a capricious romantic comedy, you won&apos;t find it here.\n\nJean Arthur is an uptight Congresswoman from Iowa investigating conditions in the bare ruined choirs of Berlin. The Colonel in charge of wrangling the Congressional committee is Millard Mitchell. He hands the committee members, Arthur included, a piece of boilerplate about how we are teaching the Germans about democracy and baseball. &quot;We teach them that if they steal anything it must be second base.&quot; It&apos;s all working out very well, if only they can get those damned kids to stop drawing swastikas every place they go.\n\nThe occupation army isn&apos;t much better. It&apos;s 1948 and the Russians haven&apos;t yet become &quot;real shifty&quot; as they would in Wilder&apos;s &quot;One, Two, Three,&quot; which appeared twelve years later, although even here they are pretty ugly, dumb, and given to vodka. At the climax, with a dead body on the floor, the night club is empty except for a couple of MPs and four Russians at one of the tables singing the Volga Boatman. But the American troops are taking advantage of the down-and-out Berliners as well, swapping chocolate bars and nylons for more tawdry treats. The Berliners, if they&apos;ve learned nothing else, have learned the arts of survival under stress and they&apos;re very cooperative. Congresswoman Arthur notices how friendly the soldiers and Frauleins are and is perturbed.\n\nIt develops that two of the major players in this illicit system are an Army Capitain, John Lund, and a nightclub singer, Marlene Dietrich. They swap favors almost every night. Of course, Lund must wind up shepherding Arthur around and they fall in love. Dietrich is jealous about the fading interest of her meal ticket, but the two women know nothing of each other. It&apos;s just that their common interest is switching his affection from one to the other.\n\nThe script by the patrician Charles Brackett and the Jewish refugee Billy Wilder crackles with subversive wit. Nobody comes out looking spotless. Human weaknesses and strengths abound -- mostly weaknesses. The plot changes as it moves along, from mostly funny to mostly dramatic and sad. When she finds out about her man&apos;s treachery, Arthur&apos;s sadness is palpable, helped along by the photography of Charles Lang, who manages to capture convincingly the wreck that the German capital has now become. People live in piles of rubble, and the script gives them a little humanity. &quot;Do you know what it was like to be a woman when the Russians came in?&quot;, Dietrich asks Arthur -- who has no idea.\n\nThe three songs sung by Dietrich sort of sum up the subject of the film and it&apos;s not funny romance -- &quot;The Black Market,&quot; &quot;Illusions,&quot; and &quot;The Ruins of Berlin.&quot; It&apos;s funny, though. There are some good gags and amusing situations. But Billy Wilder lost his mother and some of his other family in the Nazi&apos;s genocide program, and the wisecracks seem to come out of some dark shadowy corner. It&apos;s hard to imagine how it could have been otherwise. His father&apos;s grave was buried under a heap of rubble and, when he arrived in Berlin, there were still thousands of putrefying corpses buried under the collapsed bricks."

These kooky 20 and 30 somethings encounter crazy Californian surfers, bodybuilders, skydivers, and other assorted kooks. The film is never boring, but it&apos;s also never all that funny or clever either. One of the positives for the film is a supporting role by Sharon Tate, who&apos;s gorgeous and again had a terrific screen presence, reminding us of of what a loss the world had with her murder. Overall, if you want a lightweight comedy to the pass the time (which you&apos;ll completely forget about once it&apos;s over), you could do worse than &quot;Don&apos;t Make Waves.&quot;",

He and his mother convince a begrudgely naturalist/scientist/insect collector to let them tag along with him on one of his expeditions. They stay in a small village in the jungle, where not only do they encounter all sorts of wildlife, and learn about the culture of the indigenous people, but also learn about each others weaknesses and fears and relationships develop along with a bit of magic. I saw this movie on TV with my 8 year old son, I felt it had a lot of important things to teach him about humanity and nature: wildlife, disease, relationships, other cultures, other perceptions of reality, other lifestyles. It might be a bit corny for adults to watch on their own, but I felt its message was positive and profound for younger people. I also liked its slower pace, which was not boring because of all the beautiful scenery. My recommendation is rent it for your kids.",

      "reviewBody": "Each year the best and brightest at mathematics across the world come together to take part in the International Mathematical Olympiad. Within the UK the selection process involves a series of math camps, tests and waiting while the group of hopefuls is gradually whittled down to the few that will take part. This film follows a handful of hopefuls as they try to make it in the group that will be representing the UK in the 2006 IMO in Slovenia.\n\nIf you remember the success of the film Spellbound, then the best way to describe this film is to think of it as Spellbound but with numbers instead of letters. With Spellbound the casual viewer can understand the subject and see the answer while the subject tries to get it but of course with this film I was lost from the very start. Early in the film we listen to some of the questions being read out and apart from recognising that the language is English, I was lost! Fortunately, like Spellbound, director Morgan Matthews doesn&apos;t spend too long on this but rather focuses on the characters.\n\nThis is very much the forte of Morgan Matthews as he has made many &quot;quirkumentaries&quot; for the BBC over recent years. Of these most have been good even if some have been a bit too much about the quirk without anything of genuine interest in the characters or their lives. With Beautiful Young Minds the characters are interesting enough to draw the viewer in, even if the challenge during filming was that some of those focused on don&apos;t make it through to the end. This is handled reasonably well when it comes but fortunately some of the main people (Jos and Daniel) get there or thereabouts, which makes it easier to hold the viewer with the characters.\n\nMatthews doesn&apos;t judge or overplay the young minds of the title but rather just lets them be and as a result his film is more interesting than the subject would suggest. While the subject of maths is not really brought out that well, the characters are structured and delivered well in an interesting and engaging way and it is this that carries it along. However, due to the people involved mostly having some degree of autism, they are not comparable to Spellbound in regards the charm and as a result some viewers may not agree with me that the characters hold it together. Despite the social difficulties many have, they are still interesting to meet and I did like the way that the film made me challenge my preconceptions about them as people.\n\nOverall then an entertaining quirkumentary that is well delivered with good work on the characters. OK so the maths and the impact of autism on some of the characters means that Matthews doesn&apos;t totally succeed in the same way as Spellbound did but it is still a good film nonetheless."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Song Without End&quot; has a low score here on IMDb. I&apos;m not sure why. It is superior, in my opinion, in every way to &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; which is a nearly totally fictionalized story of Chopin. &quot;Song without End&quot; has the basic facts right, not to mention 40 absolutely gorgeous musical interludes. Jorge Bolet, who plays all of the piano pieces, captures the technical pyrotechnics, the richness of tone, and the passion for which Liszt was known as a performer.\n\nThe film only covers part of Liszt&apos;s life and concentrates (naturally) on the turmoil in his love affairs, which leads to his attempt to marry the already married Princess Carolyne Wittgenstein; he left his married girlfriend, Countess Marie D&apos;Agoult, the mother of his children for her. (One of his daughters, Cosima, married Richard Wagner, who features in this film.) I disagree with a previous comment complaining about the way Liszt is portrayed. While it&apos;s not emphasized, it is obvious that he was a man of great charity, donating many of his fees to various organizations, and playing many benefit concerts. Later on, he concentrated on composing, at which he was very successful. As a performer, Liszt was a bona fide rock star in his day, complete with hysterical fans. He was most certainly attractive to women and religiously conflicted.\n\nDirk Bogarde does a sensational job as Liszt. This and &quot;The Angel Wore Red&quot; were his only Hollywood films. Even if they had been successful, it&apos;s doubtful Bogarde would have stayed in the states, as he probably wouldn&apos;t have been cast in the kinds of films he wanted to make and/or the kinds of parts he wanted to play. He makes a very romantic, intense Liszt, and his fingerings are nothing short of amazing. Capucine is good, if a little wooden, as Carolyne. The supporting cast is very good.\n\nThe production and costumes are opulent, but they are dwarfed by the music. Definitely some of the most brilliantly performed classical music in film.\n\nHighly recommended for classical music lovers.",

This movie is also a combination of the two others so you can see a lot of scenes which you have also seen in the other both.\n\nAll in all there is nothing more to say about this movie.

      "reviewBody": "This is a Hong Kong action flick with a distinct taste of the west.  The movie starts off with a bombing and small store shoot-out that is right out of John Woo&apos;s stylebook but then it under goes a change.  The story starts taking over and it is one of intrigue within intrigue.  There are great moments of action with two guns blazing and an unbelievable amount of bullets but the story becomes the main thing.  This works as glue that a lot of Hong Kong movies don&apos;t have.  There are long pauses of plot developments between double crossing bad guys that are a real change to what is a typical Hong Kong action flick.\n\nThe director John Foley likes to place people in positions where they have to make critical decisions under pressure (At Close Range and Fear) and this is no exception.  A caring cop caught up in a situation of corruption is under constant pressure to decide what is right.  You are kept guessing as to his ultimate decision but the pressure is there under a dozen different situations.  The sub-plots add to the texture of this movie and add to its richness.  These side stories of the bad cop father in trouble, the interaction of rival Chinese gangs and his love of Asian culture are all parts of the puzzle that is Danny Wallace played by Mark Wahlberg.  Foley knows Wahlberg from the direction of his acting breakthrough in Fear and uses him at what he does best, the confused tough guy with the sensitive agenda. (His latest movie `The Yards&apos; is an example of what I mean). Nick Chen the experienced street cop played by Chow Yun-Fat is the perfect slightly crazy hard-hitting loner, who has embedded himself in the struggle of rival gangs in New York&apos;s Chinatown.  There is no black and white here, only shades of gray, in a world of who is doing what to whom but like the cultural differences between East and West the relationships between individuals overcomes the hard facts of doing business on the street.\n\nA very good blend of the Hong Kong actions movie that was brought in by Chow Yun-Fat (if you hear the commentary that Foley never saw a Woo movie) and what Foley&apos;s image is for street life in New York.  Coming from New York and living and working in Asia gives me insight into the homework that went into the making of this movie and I will say they did a very good job.",

In this movie his performance is equaled by Raghuvaran who&apos;s character somewhat reminded us of Ajay Devgan&apos;s role in the Hindi Movie Company. The BCoZ being based Switzerland certainly enjoyed the brilliantly shot scene for the song of Minsaram in Switzerland.",

      "reviewBody": "Following the commercial failure of &apos;Mystere Picasso&apos;, director Henri-Georges Clouzot turned to a cold war thriller by Czech writer Egon Hoskovsky. I have not read the novel so cannot judge just how loose an adaptation it is. According to Stanislas Steeman with whom he worked twice, Clouzot &apos;&apos;would build something having demolished any resemblance to the original.&apos;&apos;\n\nThis is not great Clouzot to be sure but still has touches of a master film-maker with his grasp of &apos;light&apos; and pacing. There is of course the blacker-than-black humour and the usual collection of colourful but morally vacuous characters played here by some of the best in the business.\n\nInto Dr. Malic&apos;s delapidated psychiatric clinic come Peter Ustinov as Kaminsky and Sam Jaffe as Cooper, both of them spies posing as patients and Martita Hunt, another spy, posing as a replacement nurse. There are two genuine patients in residence one of whom is a morphine addict and the other a deaf-mute. Curd Jurgens turns up as Alex but he might actually be Vogel, a nuclear scientist whose dreadful new formula is the &apos;Macguffin&apos; everyone is after. The real Vogel turns up towards the end in the person of the excellent 0. E. Hasse.\n\nI am impressed with the excellent French of Sam Jaffe and Martita Hunt who are mercifully not &apos;dubbed&apos;. Miss Hunt&apos;s portrayal is outrageous and utterly riveting. The performance that lingers longest is that of Clouzot&apos;s then wife Vera who is simply stunning as Lucie the deaf-mute.\n\nOne does not really know whether the changes of tone from satire to dark drama here are intentional or accidental and although they can be somewhat disorientating, this bizarre film still succeeds as a piece of entertainment.\n\nFollowing the excellent &apos;La Verité&apos; nothing would ever be the same for Clouzot after the sudden death of Vera in 1960 and the totally unjustified criticisms of his work from the arrogant New Ripple brigade.\n\nIt is said that a work of art reflects its creator. What that says about Henri-Georges Clouzot the man I shudder to think but let us be grateful for the films this complex individual has given us.",

      "reviewBody": "But then again I&apos;ve seen a lot worse. Certainly the weakest in a long line of recent &apos;monster&apos; spin-offs from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, that started with &quot;Shakedown - Return of the Sontarans&quot; in 1994, and went through &quot;Downtime&quot; (1995), &quot;Auton&quot; (1997) and &quot;Auton 2 : Sentinel&quot; (1998). Although the premise is an appealing one (a sci-fi take on &apos;three men stuck in a lift&apos;), the limited budget and the fact that the aim was to shoot the whole production in one day meant that the end product was a great disappointment. Miles Richardson is wonderful as the Draconian and Sophie Aldred is passable as the human. Sadly Toby Aspin - after delivering a wonderful performance as Commander Steg in &quot;Shakedown&quot; - is really terrible as Commander Sarg, who - far from the squat hissing trolls featured in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; - played Sarg as a very loud roaring character. And even then, not a terribly well played loud roaring character. Worst of all has to be Bryan Robson&apos;s &apos;Alien&apos;, who looks so terribly laughable in that mask, it is impossible to take him seriously. As a bonus on the only available release of &quot;Mindgame&quot; is &quot;The Making of Mindgame&quot;, a 37 minute production about this 30 minute film, which is happily a lot more entertaining than it&apos;s subject matter. It goes along way to explain why &quot;Mindgame&quot; turned out so bad, detailing the hideous production problems that beset Reeltime&apos;s small crew. And when viewed in that context.. it somehow doesn&apos;t seem as bad as it first appeared.",

      "reviewBody": "No amount of ultra-cool cinematography can hide the fact that Skyline Cruisers is a vacuous affair, devoid of real excitement or drama. For the most part, it exists as an exercise in aesthetics - from the good looking cast (including babes, Shu Qi and Michelle Saram) to the slick high-tech gadgetry, style is paramount. The result is a good looking but turgid and confusing mess.\n\nA gang of cool thieves are enlisted by a scientist to help retrieve a stolen cure for cancer. Using an array of amazing spy gadgetry (the likes of which make the invisible James Bond car seem possible), they attempt to break into a top security lab  but all is not as it at first seems.\n\nThe film starts with an unbelievable (and I mean that in a bad way) heist that piles the nonsensical upon the absurd. Once this tone is set, it continues for the majority of the running time. Unfortunately, instead of acknowledging and embracing the downright absurdity of the plot, the cast seems to be taking things far too seriously. Only in the closing scenes do the proceedings get crazy enough to become truly entertaining. If director, Wilson Yip, had ignored all attempts at being cool, and had made the whole film as ridiculously gung-ho and over-the-top as the last few minutes, he may have had something of a cult hit on his hands  instead, the end result is yet another disappointing HK actioner.",

This is a heartfelt little tale of struggle and a journey of survival it touches your emotions showing that everyone has good in them and life is an unexpected journey. Set in the deep rural south I believe Alabama you have Sally Field as Amy Post a sweet and love like street walking hotel staying hooker who earns 20 dollars for each bang she gives. Things shakeup a little bit when she meets the rough and rugged Elmore Pratt(Tommy Lee Jones) a man who&apos;s dreams of becoming a prize fighter has blown up in smoke as now he moonlights as a taxi car washer! After hooking up the two decide to journey out to California the best way they can as money will not stop them. This is an interesting journey in which both each learn respect, love and courage it proves life is a journey of discovery and learning how to love. Overall good little underrated gem to watch.",

Well I think it works because of the broken up and choppy style between scenes. We do not move from scene 1 to 2 to 3 until eventually we come to a happy conclusion, instead we are moved here and there not ultimately leading us to a big bust or the worst bad guy, but simply the guys the police have to deal with on a daily basis. At least for me these small time crimes are reflective of real police work, we are not chasing some super intelligent sicko serial killer here, it&apos;s not CSI, Bones, or any of those silly shows.\n\nIn a perfect world the police would have the resources and power to stop illegal acts, but the police force like any large government institution becomes bogged down and convoluted under it&apos;s own weight. Imagine writing off to the stationery department to get a stapler if you were a cop, this would invariably happen. And at least Tavernier can show us the unglorious truth in it&apos;s ridiculous splendour.\n\nThere is also no black and white areas here. The police give junkies drugs for information. They use some tough methods with the criminals. They&apos;re methods are often made up on the spot and often things go horribly wrong.\n\nI cannot recommend this film enough. I picked it up on the off chance and I was not at all disappointed.",

This forms the pin-point juncture of the movie surrounding which the plot revolves. Fun Packed, with a large chunk of recycled jokes with too little of Jackie Chan action , thats what I felt of the movie from a totally neutral perspective.But being a Jackie Chan fan that I am , the movie is an entertainer with loads of fun n chicks. Rush hour 3 evolves on predictable lines ,but still entertainment quotient remains pretty high throughout. The on screen chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is simply rocking . But for an avid Jackie fan like me nothing pains more than a movie , with him in the rolls and yet , not having the traditional breathtaking Jackie Stunts. But for a man aged 53 Jackie is still more fast , agile and flexible than most of his much younger co-stars. The last stunt atop the Eiffel tower was a masterstroke with Jackie and Tucker defying height and gravity to put up a creditable show .But yeah, the movie ought to be a disappointment for those who expected a still young, reckless and crazy Jackie running around and kicking arse of the do-no-gooders. There is less of the traditional slap stick comedy that one associates with Jackie Chan movies. On the whole, a must watch for Jackie fans with a very high quotient of entertainment value .",

The patient Miguel (Demian Bichir) tells information about the place and Beatriz discloses surprising secrets.\n\nThe first sensation I had while watching &quot;Hipnos&quot; was a claustrophobic and discomfort emotion. The way the story is disclosed provokes bad feelings in the viewer. When the mystery is disclosed, I felt like watching a David Lynch movie, such as &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, or Alejandro Amenábar&apos;s &quot;Abre los Ojos&quot;, so weird the story is. I liked this movie a lot which I believe that it has a great potential of cult-movie. Cristina Brondo has an amazing performance, and the surprising final twist is excellent. I believe the next time I see this movie I will like it more. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Hipnos&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "For those unfamiliar with the works of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, this video will give merely a glimpse into their musical genius.  This band evolved from a heavy-metal band from the mid-80&apos;s called Savatage.  As they grew musically, they began to incorporate classical music into their work, ranging from Mozart to Mussgorsky to Beethoven.  The Trans-Siberian Orchestra was a side project conceived originally to perform Christmas music, blending traditional and new compositions with a group of highly talented musicians.\n\nThis video is just a touch of what they are.  Many &quot;guest&quot; performers, such as Michael Crawford and Jewel appear in the video.  Watching this video will hopefully give one a desire to look further into the band.  These wonderful artists have woven 3 albums together (2 Christmas, and one not) of intricate story-telling, poetry, and, of course, wonderful music.\n\nIf you do enjoy what you see and hear, do yourself a favor.  Next Christmas, look for their live performance to come to a city near you, and buy a ticket.  It is a musical spectacle you will thank yourself for.  I have been a Savatage fan for many years, and have now seen TSO play live 3 years in a row.  WOW.  The collection of musicians, mostly unknowns, is unrivaled. The compositions are wonderful, the performances even more so.  Worth every penny.\n\nAs a side note, TSO&apos;s single non-Christmas release, &quot;Beethoven&apos;s Last Night&quot;, is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Released nearly 2 years ago, I rarely go as much as a week without listening to it.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was a gargantuan disappointment on nearly all levels.  Based on the late-60s/early-70s TV show, the movie could have been a hip, funny update OR a straight, reverent recreation from the period which it came from.  Alas, the filmmakers botched it with a dull, hackneyed &quot;dirty cops on the inside&quot; plot we&apos;ve seen countless times before.  The direction is stiff and  Character development is sorely lacking, making it impossible for us to grow any attachment to them.  And for what&apos;s supposed to be an action film, there&apos;s a definite lack of energy and visual pizzazz.\n\nClaire Danes and Omar Epps are fine (if a bit too low-key) in their roles, but Giovanni Ribisi gives one of the most highly annoying performances in recent memory.  He plays his character (Pete Cochran) like some doped-up, marble-mouthed clod.  Even if everything else in the film were fine, his performance here would still be a serious detriment.\n\nWhat could have been a classy, fun film is rendered an unfortunate misfire. OH, what Quentin Tarantino could have done with this material!!"

      "reviewBody": "There are fairy/folk tales that perhaps lend themselves better to short films or television episodes. Would class &apos;Das Tapfere Schneiderlein&apos;, translated into English as &apos;The Brave Tailor&apos; as actually a fairy/folk tale that has enough to sustain just about feature length, with a lot going on. It is typically for the Brothers Grimm (or at least their collection of tales) entertaining and engaging, even if not among their most imaginative.\n\n1956&apos;s &apos;Das Tapfere Schneiderlein&apos; makes do as an older adaptation of a story that is not adapted an awful lot compared to other Brothers Grimm fairy/folk tales, even if you only see it once. Seen as part of my older East German fairy/folk tale quest, it is not one of the best but it is a definite interest point for those interested in seeing older fairy/folk tale stories adaptations. The case with me. Still continue to feel why there aren&apos;t any more of these old East German fairy/folk tale film adaptations around and why those that are available aren&apos;t better known, because most are better than a lot of fairy/folk tale adaptations made in recent years.\n\nIt has its dull and occasionally aimless stretches and the film could have shorter by about ten minutes, despite saying that the story has enough to fill a length longer than a short film/television episode length.\n\nNot all the acting is the best, Christel Bodenstein&apos;s performance can tend to be pantomimic but the character is part of the problem, difficult to bring much endearing to anybody with a selfish, vindictive character trait.\n\nHowever, &apos;Das Tapfere Schneiderlein&apos; has a lot of good things. Visually it holds up with imaginative production design particularly. It was appreciated that it wasn&apos;t too flashy or big in spectacle at the risk of being overblown and not too much on effects at the expense of everything else. Atmosphere, whimsy and character is peppered in the music. A nice job is done mostly with the characters, with an easy to root for protagonist/titular character.\n\n&apos;Das Tapfere Schneiderlein&apos; doesn&apos;t get too mature or too dark that it is inaccessible for younger audiences, yet it also doesn&apos;t get too childish that adults feel there&apos;s not enough for them. It would have been a shame if either or both of those things happened because &apos;The Brave Little Tailor&apos; is a story that has enough appeal for both target audiences and suitable for the whole family. Even if familiarity with the story may need to be in order perhaps. The story is charming and entertaining on the most part, it does get strange but weird in an intriguing, fun way and not in a way that cohesion is lost.\n\nAll in all, nicely done. 7/10",

The box cover and the reviews for this 1984 sleeper showcase this movie as the sexiest and most controversial film since Last Tango in Paris. Although it has as much, if not more nudity, there is no passion. Year of the Jelly Fish is the story of a young girl, becoming a woman. But there is more to the story. Somewhat of a sex craved youngster, Kaprisky portrays an innocent girl who doesn&apos;t want to be innocent. Then again, sex is not her reward. There is an unexplained mom / daughter relationship that has its moments on screen, but overall fails to really explain the struggle between the two characters. The men that these two women share is a struggle in itself. Both characters want to be loved, then again, sometimes all it is is sex that drives them both.\n\nThe movie has a series of moments that keep Kaprisky fans watching. The rest of the movie tries to remain serious, but for todays audience, it fails to hold up. All in all, this is a must see for Kaprisky fans. It is one of her best and most &quot;looked for&quot; films in her career.",

It would get a far better rating from me if a few more dollars had been put in.\n\nA team of scientists on top a mountain in what would be ancient Mesopotamia, today Iraq find on top the mountain a cave leading to an ancient Sumerian civilization which has survived their almost for 5000 years. Probably the greatest archaeological find ever, imagine finding some ancient Egyptians hidden away, clinging to their cultural traditions. The greatest opportunity ever to research a culture.\n\nOf course some of these are not quite human, they&apos;ve returned to being mole like humans and they&apos;re the slaves. It&apos;s a slow punishment for the bad, a quick punishment is the hated fires of Ishtar. You&apos;re sent into what looks like an oven and you&apos;re burnt away to ashes.\n\nThe film does a marvelous job in building up the viewers fears of the fires of Ishtar so in the end when the scientists are flung into it, we&apos;re scared witless.\n\nJohn Agar, Hugh Beaumont, and Nestor Paiva are some of the scientists and the high priest of Ishtar is Alan Napier. What is the fire of Ishtar? That&apos;s not a question to be answered here. See the film and find out.",

There was the odd moment that made me giggle, with Natalie Palamides, as the crazy demented Funzo, being the standout, but the laughs were very few and far between.

      "reviewBody": "Hammer helped define the gothic vampire genre, for which we should be thankful, but they also found need to dabble in other fields with mixed results.  Shatter did not have the most inspired mixture and doesn&apos;t stand the test of time very well.  Perpetually grouchy killer for hire Stuart Whitman fails goes to Hong Kong where he fails to collect from disreputable banker Anton Diffring.  Corrupt government official Peter Cushing has his men beat the pulp out of Whitman, who stumbles off to a massage parlor where kung fu master Lung Ti treats him to a freebie from adorable Li-Li Li (whose name sounds like the refrain to a doo-wop song).  Whitman finds his apartment blown up so he takes refuge at his new friends&apos; dojo.  He slips underground for a while but gets attacked at a martial arts invitational won by understated Ti.  Without questioning the moral validity of his instincts, they help him in his quest to extort a mil from Diffring.  International affairs gets somewhat sticky from here, and the bullets fly freely until the predictable climax.  Carreras tries his best to present Whitman as a then-prevalent philosopher killer, but the weak introspective sequences that show Whitman roaming around his apartment fail to do the trick.  The apparently sensitive regret he feels for his victims comes off as a brooding doom with little real emotion backing it up.  Shatter&apos;s intolerance for international culture makes a few unexpected peeps from its veneer of acceptance.  Snooty references to eating snakes evidence a discomfort with the behavior of a foreign country.  The background story sets this attitude in stone: Whitman&apos;s being tracked down for getting involved with political affairs in Badawi, a corrupt puppet country in Africa in which brothers contentedly murder brothers for money and power.  Such situations may perhaps at time truly occur, but the same can be found in Shakespeare with less disapproval asked of the audience.  The degree of acceptance present can be seen as a sense of tragedy, completely disconnected with the random slaying of evil black or Asian characters.  I don&apos;t mean to push the point, but I found it odd that both major black characters were played no-name Yemi Ajibade in an otherwise internationally well-known cast.  Cult director Monte Hellman apparently assisted Carreras, far more experienced as a producer, but did not receive credit.  Writer Don Houghton produced the other Shaw/Hammer co-production, The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires and also takes credit for the awful but amusing Dracula AD 1972.  Scenes allegedly shot in Badawi, a country that does not exist, were probably done in Hong Kong."

      "reviewBody": "A.K.A. Cassius Clay (1970) was a documentary made during the time that Muhammed Ali was on &quot;hiatus&quot; from the world of professional boxing due to his strong religious beliefs. The film makers use a lot of valuable achieved footage, interviews with the Champ himself and those that were heavily involved in his life. A lot of classic Malcolm X footage can be found in this film as well. If you want to get a look into the life of the &quot;Greatest Heavyweight Boxer of all time&quot; then I advise you to watch this film. No dramatical theatrics. Just the man himself.\n\nI would also recommend THE GREATEST as well. If you want to get a full picture of Muhammed Ali. I wish that somebody would do a film of his post-Zaire boxing career. Now that would be a fascinating film to see the &quot;Elvis&quot; phase of Muhammed Ali. I&apos;ve read Ferdie Pacheco&apos;s book. Someone in Hollywood needs to make a big screen version of it. \n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "So Pelle keeps getting older and now public school is over. He is enjoying summer and everything seems peaceful with low criminal rates in his town of Middellund. He has done his job well and is about to be honored with a big statue of himself. \n\nHe has decided to start school in another town after summer to his friend, Wilhelms big disappointment. \n\nHis alter ego, the superhero Antboy, has almost retired but suddenly an old enemy, the Flea, is released from prison. Antboy, as well as the Citizens of Middellund, is afraid, and almost certain, that the town again will suffer under his Reign. He has a curriculum vitae as a child kidnapper and earlier nothing would stand in his way to bring Antboy down....\n\nAntboy is called out to deal with three burglars but as the action is about to start a new superhero enters the scene, much to Antboys dismay and takes over in a very impressing way. Antboys position as the towns big and only savior has now been challenged and jealousy is starting to get hold of our hero. The new superhero is on every citizens lips and Antboy (maybe because of his jealousy) is very suspicious of him. \n\nThe story develops, not so straightforward as you might fear, but of course disclosure finally settles in as the camera leaves our protagonists joyfully. \n\nThe force of the movie is its humour, as our hero in many ways resembles an anti hero. Not only as Pelle, but as much when he emerges as Antboy. Small, with a weird suit on and no sign of even the smallest muscle he saves Middellund. A couple of scenes was well told but humour could have been added with much more flavor. The special effects cannot challenge those of other similar movies and therefore the formula should have been more creative. \n\nI don&apos;t expect a movie like this to give a proper an nuanced description of a given milieu in which it takes place but having said that, it could have spiced things up a little if the whole story didn&apos;t take place between big villas in an upper class neighborhood. \n\nI went in with my two daughters, age 9 and 11. My oldest almost gave up after half an hour but I succeeded in challenging how to predict the story. My youngest daughter was engulfed and enjoyed the slapstick scenes. \n\nOn a rainy winter day it served its purpose.\n\nRegards Simon",

This folktale is important because the original text contains some details about life of the common Thai people during the 18th and 19th centuries. It has many lessons of life that can be learned if you are willing to pay attention to it. The characters are real with real human flaws. It is not an idealized version of a perfect hero. It shows you the consequences of making bad decisions. You can also see the many flaws of human nature such as greed, pride, lust, wrath and envy. It would help you if you researched the folktale before or after you watch the movie. The folktale is about &quot;Khun Chang, Khun Pan&quot;. I hope you enjoy the movie.",

It references other movies (Meet the Parents, When Harry met Sally etc.) but doesn&apos;t really spoof them. This was the biggest problem I believe, as it doesn&apos;t have any semblance of flow or sense. Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. I managed to sit through House of the Dead, but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny. Please skip it, have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it. If they don&apos;t knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself.",

      "name": "A solid portrayal of modern warfare",
      "reviewBody": "While a tad overlong and light on character development, SPECIAL FORCES nevertheless delivers a fairly solid entry in the modern warfare genre. The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn&apos;t help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current &quot;en vogue&quot; style of somewhat shaky &quot;cinema verite&quot; realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we&apos;re shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they&apos;ve been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they&apos;re in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark. Still, it makes for a somewhat entertaining, slightly taxing, viewing experience.",

There are cool scenes like a motorcycle attack, people getting smacked and run over by cars, and gunfights with Peckinpah-esque squib action and slow motion bodies falling. A tad confusing with all the players and Italian names, but all the while very exciting. Nero is great as a steaming angry cop and so is Rey as a sick and possibly dying mob boss. Good characters, intriguing plot, and lots of action make a great film.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is located at the &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; (bigbig, legendary and well-known drinking fest for dumb white-bread idiots) in Munich/Germany. A man who is dissatisfied with his senseless existence in his family-life and social status steals the uniform of a policeman and then enters the &quot;Oktoberfest&quot;. - Now he is somebody, he is important, he can help, people respect him, etc. His wife, other relatives and some friends start to follow him while he gets some new acquaintances. The craziness begins! Full ahead! You cannot really say what the sense of this movie is, maybe it&apos;s about senselessness of life in general and about the relativity of common values. Amateur actors philosophize about this and that - most of them unemotional as a stone. But this doesn&apos;t ruin the movie - it&apos;s quite the contrary and supports the absurdity of the scenes and texts. There&apos;s no real storyline, it&apos;s more like a collage of sketches and clips. And it&apos;s also funny that you never know if the protagonists are actors who know they play for the movie (but I guess they do not know WHAT KIND of movie this is!!) or if they are just visitors of the Oktoberfest who happen to fall victim to a crazy-genius movie-director by chance, you know, like hidden-camera or something. - You never know. - And sometimes people get really angry by being annoyed by our false policeman out of control - and I am very sure that he&apos;d got some punches in the face without this uniform. Many of the mono- and dialogues are really funny as hell and also quite intelligent in a subtle and subversive meaning. This movie and with it it&apos;s director was a total find for me, I must recommend this a lot, 10 out of 10!",

It stars Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried in the title role. Its screenplay was written by Erin Cressida Wilson, based on the earlier French film, written by Anne Fontaine.\n\nCatherine (Moore) hires Chloe (Seyfried), an escort, to test her husband&apos;s (Neeson) loyalty towards her. However, Chloe falls in love with Catherine and the two women get intimate, which complicates their lives.\n\nChloe starts off as an intriguing psychological drama - and then begins to veer off into B-movie territory, although Egoyan packs in enough wisdom about the slow erosion of relationships, about aging, about female desire, to make the film utterly worthwhile. Moore and Seyfried provide the film with an intense breath of authenticity guaranteeing you feel the pain inflicted upon their characters by the plot&apos;s extreme circumstances.\n\nThe script&apos;s feminine perspective helps elevate the film from Egoyan&apos;s usual sexy (but satisfying) thriller into something a tad more insightful. The films seductive aesthetic is both distancing and, largely on the strength of Moore&apos;s translucent performance and Seyfried&apos;s boldness, forcibly intimate.\n\nThe film may be predictable and a little messy when it comes to the story-telling but Moore and Seyfried deliver enough hot chemistry to keep an audience&apos;s interest until the final moments. Between the strong acting, camera work, the subtle yet powerful score and a compelling story that lures us immediately, Chloe is ultimately a recommended watch.",

However, it&apos;s a film worth watching to see some really talented acting and directing. Ian McShane, i thought, was the standout and was thoroughly brilliant as Meredith - i was blown away by his performance and every time he spoke i hung on his every word. Surely (at least) deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Ray Winstone was scarily good, He wasn&apos;t an actor and it wasn&apos;t a movie. Ray Winstone had me utterly convinced that he was a broken down man who was being torn to pieces, both mentally and physically - but mostly mentally lol. The direction was also magnificent and the settings were just awe-inspiring, The way in which they made the surroundings look so sinister was just terrific. Although, i must say that the plot was a little dry. The director, the actors and the script-writers did an astonishingly good job, but the movie itself was a little disappointing.",

      "reviewBody": "Yves Robert passed away three years ago and any cine buff remembers him for his towering achievements that are: &quot;la Guerre des Boutons&quot; (1962), an adaptation of Louis Pergaud&apos;s famous novel still fresh today as it was forty three years ago, &quot;my Father&apos;s Glory&quot; and &quot;my Mother&apos;s Castle&quot; (1990), adaptations of Marcel Pagnol&apos;s childhood memories. And don&apos;t forget a good pack of quality comedies treated with respect and no vulgarity. This flick, &quot;Alexandre le Bienheureux&quot; (1967) largely deserves its place of winner among them.\n\nIn 1880, Paul Laforgue wrote and published an essay entitled: &quot;le Droit à la Paresse&quot; (the Right to Laziness) in which he offered a positive definition about this term generally considered as one of the biggest vices in the world. But Laforgue shelved the negative prejudices about it. He suggested to leave work fallow and to devote free time to rest and leisure which enabled a beneficial development for the individual. I suppose Yves Robert did the same for his movie. Without taking itself too seriously, it presents itself as a comical tale in which laziness is praised because thanks to it, happiness and the possibility to enjoy basic pleasures of life prevail. There&apos;s no need to worry about the constraints and stress imposed by work and modern society. And in the background, there&apos;s this country filmed with love and delicacy which Robert seems to know like the back of his hand.\n\nSeen today, the movie displays a few technical flaws that weren&apos;t noticeable in 1967. Certain shots or camera movements are dated and it lets us think that the movie on a technical level hasn&apos;t worn well. But it has no importance for it kept an undeniable charm and can be watched with pleasure again. And a few funny moments in Robert&apos;s work evoke the devastating humor coming from Tex Avery&apos;s cartoons like the orchestra in front of Alexandre&apos;s house.\n\nPhilippe Noiret in the main role acts the role of Alexandre with an admirable easiness and naturalness. Because of its physical appearance and as he is inseparable from his dog Kaly, he is akin to Obélix with his tiny dog Idéfix. The rest of the cast follows him well and includes Pierre Richard and Jean Carmet.\n\nAt the level of the quality in Robert&apos;s filmography, &quot;Alexandre le Bienheureux&quot; is just a few notches below Robert&apos;s flicks I previously mentioned. It&apos;s the kind of movie to full savor after a hard day&apos;s work or after a Jean Luc Godard intellectual movie. Given that it is difficult to find in DVD, it deserves to be restored in favor and considering all the favors did by Kaly to his master, Robert&apos;s movie perfectly illustrates the famous maxim: &quot;man&apos;s best friend is the dog&quot;.",

Chad McQueen(Steve&apos;s son) plays a cop who teams with Cynthia Rothrock who also can kick some serious butt. I like it when she does that over the head kick that&apos;s really stealthy. David Carradine plays the sinister crime boss, Dalton Rhodes. It was amazing when he does that lethal palm strike to the heart of that huge guy. When done right, it can kill. Unfortunately, Sean&apos;s brother Micheal(Andy McCutcheon) fell the powerful impact of it when he was working for Rhodes. I liked the scene where Sean(McQueen) and Billie(Rothrock) took on the thugs, and Billie does the split and did some repeated groin punches on one the thugs. That&apos;s enough to make Johnny Cage jealous! I also like the confrontation fight between Sean and Dalton. It was great to see Dalton get a taste of his own blow. That blow is only good for defense, not for fun among friends. This movie is a lot of fun, and it&apos;s a keeper in my book! 3 out of 5 stars!",

How can a horror fan watch this and not be in some kind of heaven? \n\nRoger Ebert says this film is &quot;one of those movies that fall somewhere between buried treasures and guilty pleasures.&quot; He further says it is &quot;an off-the-wall, eccentric, peculiar movie fueled by the demented obsessions of its makers.&quot; He means this in the nicest way possible, and I love him for that.\n\nAuthor John Kenneth Muir notes that Swamp Thing differs in many respects from Craven&apos;s usual work, in that Craven&apos;s intent was to show the major Hollywood studios that he could handle action, stunts and major stars. Craven substituted his usual focus on the problems of the family and society for pure entertainment. And you know what? He did it flawlessly.\n\nWhy is this film in French on Netflix? There has to be a good reason, but I have no idea why. Also, this film needs a decent DVD release. The Netflix one looks like a VHS transfer. I know it was released a few years ago, but how about a 30th anniversary edition in 2012 with some good features? \n\nAnd lastly, how this scores a PG rating with three topless women is beyond me. But, well played, Wes.",

      "reviewBody": "Adventure and moving drama/action movie with nice mood, it is a rich, robust and colorful picture, a hell-for-leather stuff. And is set in the 19th century, during the German colonial rule. Victorian railway builder Robert Adamson (Robert Taylor) adventures off into the kitted out with lovable native urchin (Dimech), pretty white lady in distress, Jane Carlton (Anne Aubrey), plus comic relief (Anthony Newley). Adamson finds out that his planned route for the new railroad is passing through some very perilous and unfriendly native tribal areas as well as a competing German railroad company will cause him trouble and prevent him from finishing his railroad. Africa as you&apos;ve never seen it!. A thousand thrilling African adventures !. More savage than most savage Africa!. See sinister assault of the deadly crocodiles ! Ruthles terror of the slave traders!. Bull elephant attack!. Flamed! Haired beauty!.\n\nExciting, thrilling picture set in Mombasa in the turbulent Africa during colonial period. It is a rousing, moving, and stirring tale , but rough-edged fare. A compendium of gorgeous outdoors, intrigue, imperialism , colonialism and provocation, regarding African natives, wildlife, feminism, and anything else. The movie is both incident packed and deadly slow: a Richard Thorpe speciality. Evelyn Waugh crossed paths with the production in Kenya, an encounter he described in ¨A tourist in Africa¨. Among the rush of Anglo-American oddities from circa 1960 this encomium for the British Empire at its moment of maximum desintegration from a past splendor is in a class by itself. Stars Robert Taylor playing in his usual style as a railway engineer who arrives in the Kilimanjaro Region to finish building a railroad through hostile territory. He&apos;s well accompanied by a pretty good support cast, such as: Anthony Newley, Anne Aubrey, Grégoire Aslan, Allan Cuthbertson, Martin Benson, Orlando Martins, Harry Baird and Donald Pleasence.\n\nOne of several lively, all-action, color de luxe adventures produced by Britain&apos;s Warwick films, in this production company usually played Robert Taylor, Alan Ladd and Victor Mature as stars in the late Fifties .Warwick was set up by Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli, and its main purpose was that it offered an European lifeline to fading Hollywood star. This picture was one of many from Warwick Films which were shot quickly and consequently released, such as: &apos;The Bandit of Zhobe&apos; (1956) with Victor Mature, Anita Ekberg, &apos;The Man Inside&apos; (1958) with Jack Palance, Anita Ekberg, &apos;Tank Force!&apos; aka &apos;No Time To Die&apos; (1958) with Victor Mature, Anthony Newley and &apos;Killers of Kilimanjaro&apos; (1959). The ambient of the country at the time is pretty well shown accompanied by an atmospheric and brilliant cinematography in Technicolor by Ted Moore. As well as thrilling and evocative musical score by William Alwyn and musical director by regular Muir Matheson. Being shot on location in Nairobi National Park, and Nairobi, Kenya for tribal village and exteriors and Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, Inglaterra, Reino Unido for interiors. Lavishly produced by the notorious producers Irving Allen and the famous Albert R. Broccoli who subsequently to finance the successful James Bond series . The motion picture produced by Warwick along with Columbia Pictures was decently directed by Richard Thorpe. He was an ordinary Hollywood crafsman who made routine studio fare until 1950s when he was given more major assignment. He then made various big-budget productions financed by Pando S. Bergman among his best known films are all the MGM Tarzans following his arrival at the studio in 1935 and a series of swashbuckling adventures in the early 1950s featuring Robert Taylor , the most successful of these were three swashbucklers made in England as ¨Knights of Round Table , Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward¨ . Thorpe was an expert on all kind of genres as Western as ¨Vengeance valley , Wild horse , Under Montana skies and Last challenge¨ but his specialty resulted to be adventures as ¨Prisoner of Zenda , The prodigal , Challenge to Lassie , Malaya , Tarzan&apos;s secret treasure ,Tarzan escapes , Tarzan finds a son¨ and Musicals as ¨Fun in Acapulco , Rainbow over Broadway , The prince student¨ and his biggest money-maker to date was ¨The great Caruso¨ and his last big box-office hit was ¨Presley&apos; Jailhouse Rock¨ . He also worked briefly in television before retiring in 1968 , his last film was ¨The last challenge&apos;. Rating. 6/10. Acceptable and passable African adventure that will appeal to Robert Taylor fans.",

If you are a fan of ninja movies and have a sense of humor then see this! The character Action fighter is Jemaine Clement who is one half of Flight of the Conchords, a comedy act. They are a wonderful act so it ties into the comedy of this film. This comedy is what I call stupid funny, it is so stupid that it is funny! It is from a bunch of comedic friends who decided to make a movie, pretty good effort! What is nice as well are the extras like commentary, and the making of the film which is also funny. Seriously, take this movie lightly and enjoy some good laughs!",

      "reviewBody": "Naukari (1954) : Brief Review -\n\nBimal Roy&apos;s Comic and Tragic take on Horrors of Unemployment. Naukari is deservingly termed as Bimal Roy&apos;s one of most sensitive film because i feel this film doesn&apos;t have typical drama we see in other bollywood films. Especially, there is no happy ending which makes a big difference when you consider its release period. The film shows horrors of unemployment and it doesn&apos;t hesitate to keep it utterly horrible. Many films of that time have turned upside down just to please audience and let them leave with with happiness after the the film but Naukari was one of the big contradiction to that traditional filmmaking. The film is about the dreams and aspirations of the educated youth getting shattered as they struggle in the city for employment, in the ensuing years after India attained independence. Ratan Kumar Choudhary played by Kishore Kumar portrays that realistic and helpless struggler with immense honesty. Sheila Ramani as Ratan&apos;s love interest Seema also delivers an honest performance and even though it doesn&apos;t have much varieties, the character plays an important role in the climax. Bimal Roy had already made heartening film like Do Bigha Zameen (1953) which had very serious tone to it but with Naukari Bimal da brings that much needed comic touch. He crafts all the situations with his brilliant vision and execute it in proper cinematic manners. Watch out for that Letter burning scene which looks so ordinary when it happens but in next 5 minutes you know how important that ordinary scene was for the storyline. Naukari is also one of those rare films to have offbeat and peculiar combination of Comedy and Tragedy. Overall, Naukari is a hard film to watch for youth audience but it deserves to be watched by every single aspiring youngster to learn the most important message of their age. Don&apos;t forget this was just before Raj Kapoor&apos;s sensational blockbuster &apos;Shree 420&apos;.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

      "reviewBody": "Ah, the 80s! It was quite a different time. Loud fashion, ecstatic energy. I love most of the 80&apos;s teen films, more than the 90&apos;s and 2000&apos;s films. There was a certain closeness between the characters and they were portrayed as real humans rather than just horny caricatures. Michael Lehmann&apos;s &apos;Heathers&apos; is one of the best dark comedy teen satires. Lehmann briefly tackles many themes that are of concern to teenagers such as bulimia, popularity, bullying to self-esteem and suicide. This was the time when Christian Slater was a promising actor, when Winona Ryder wasn&apos;t arrested for shoplifting and when Shannen Doherty wasn&apos;t known yet for her unprofessionalism. the actors themselves were teenagers at the time and their performances come across as very natural. Slater perhaps gives his best performance while the adorable Ryder has gone from strength to strength until she almost vanishes into oblivion. Doherty is very cute and who knows what she could have achieved had she been more professional and not gone into soaps. I wonder whether the very young cast understood what kind of film they were doing or did they think of it as acting in a teen-flick? Waters is writing is amazing and even though a lot of the film is exaggerated, it brilliantly mirrors teen-life in the 80&apos;s (which isn&apos;t that different today either) and is brutally honest but at the same time funny. The dialogues and one liners are extremely comical and at the same time wonderfully simple. There&apos;s also a lot of clever symbolism. For example, Slater&apos;s Jason Dean says: People will look at the ashes of Westerburg and say, &quot;Now there&apos;s a school that self-destructed, not because society didn&apos;t care, but because the school was society.&quot; This one line does mark a crucial truth about teenagers because for most teenagers, high-school IS society. Forget these &apos;American Pies&apos;, &apos;Mean Girls&apos;, &apos;One Tree Hills&apos; etc. None of these wannabe teen flicks will ever be able to match up to the excellence of &apos;Heathers&apos;. This is one of (if not THE) the best teen films."

      "reviewBody": "A well crafted, highly watchable documentary, &quot;A Regular Frankie Fan&quot; is enjoyable for both fans and non-fans of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The audience for the screening I attended was made up mostly of hard-core RH fans and they loved it, turning the evening into an audience participation event - much like one would expect at a midnight show. They delighted in seeing their efforts on screen, and shouting back at the documentary&apos;s subjects who either met with their approval or disapproval. My guess is that all the RH fans will appreciate the way director/fan Scott Mabbutt has sympathetically presented them and their particular &quot;obsession.&quot;\n\nAlthough I briefly participated in the Rocky Horror experience some 20+ years ago, I would, today, place myself in the non-fan category. Nevertheless, I enjoyed &quot;Frankie Fan.&quot;  I think it presented the fans in a very positive, human, and dignified manner.  Although some of the interviewees did have a tendency to go on at length or move on to off-subject tangents (which slowed the pacing a bit), what they had to say was very much of interest.  They talked about feeling like outcasts, what the &quot;Rocky&quot; experience meant to them socially, and how it gave them a sense of being a part of something.  This, to me, is the most interesting aspect of the documentary because it transcends the surface trappings of a movie and touches on something that is important to all of us - the desire to belong.  Of course, the overt sexuality of the phenomenon definitely appealing, and this aspect is well represented too. It&apos;s worth your time.  Catch it if you can.",

New additions to the cast include Barry Jones, who gives the thing gravitas as Claudius, and Ernest Borgnine and black American actor William Marshall in dignified supporting roles. (It also has a strong female contingent led by Susan Hayward&apos;s haughty, flame-haired Messalina who boasts that &quot;my claws are sharper than the tiger&apos;s&quot;; with Anne Bancroft in a small part and even an unbilled Julie Newmar shaking those hips as a dancing girl.)\n\nThe most decisive piece of casting, however, is director Delmer Daves, who just rolls up his sleeves and gets stuck into delivering all this nonsense with gusto.",

      "reviewBody": "this is really two films, an hour long crime comedy and a half-hour kung fu film. i think hong Kong audiences can deal with such a mix better than most westerners. at any rate, the kung fu movie is enjoyable, very quickly paced, with some notable stunts - but to be honest, it offered very little new, and doesn&apos;t really meet the standard set by other films starring sammo hung and Jackie Chan from this era.\n\nthe comedy, on the other hand, is really fun to watch, even when it isn&apos;t knee-slapping laff-out-loud funny. this appears to be a little bit of a tribute to the Marx bros., with a touch of Cantonese slap-stick tossed in. it&apos;s really character-driven comedy; the funny bits could happen only because the characters are who they are. consequently, it just makes sense for a character - who was stupid enough to gamble on whether a fly would land on his poker hand - to be discovered looking for a hundred bucks he had lost outside at night inside a hotel lobby because &apos;the light&apos;s better in here&apos;. there&apos;s also much physical comedy which is actually better to see than for me to describe.\n\none major warning - i&apos;ve seen this film now in its original hong Kong version, which included mandarin and English subtitles; its original English-dub American release; its recent re-subtitled release; its recent re-dubbed release. of the four versions, the re-dubbed is by far the worst translation of the original dialog. although released on DVD with the new subtitles available, and so one would suppose the dub and the subtitles would be identical, they didn&apos;t even get this right - use the subtitles, avoid the new dub. and there are still crucial moments lost in the new subtitles. at one point, a character, trying to act tough, is asked what he would do if someone bumped into his car; the subtitle has him say that - essentially - he would force the guy to beg for mercy; that&apos;s not what he says, what he says is that &apos;i would beg for mercy&apos; - in other words, this is the moment when his sham is exposed. i can imagine literally hundred - thousands - of people missing this joke entirely due to the bad translation here. \n\nthe best version - its original hong Kong version which includes mandarin and English subtitles .\n\nstill, even with this problem as obvious as it is, i think audiences will still find a lot to like about this film. the characters - all performed by the famous lucky-stars Chinese opera group that produced hung, Chan, yuen wah, and yuen biao - all present here BTW - are so amiable and unpretentious, it&apos;s hard not to like them, and if you do like them, you will have a good time.",

There were also a number of fascinating scenes in this movie, many of which would probably not be for all tastes.  In fact, much like most Verhoeven films, this movie probably isn&apos;t for everybody, since it does get somewhat graphic at times.  However, if you are a person who can handle the occasional disturbing image, then I would say that you should give this film a look.",

This gets my vote as the most unintentionally fall-on-your-ass hilarious movie ever made; you simply can&apos;t write comedy this good! The dialogue must have turned John Waters chartreuse with envy, and the performance by Steven Boyd is akin to what if one of the THUNDERBIRDS marionettes had been cast in WHO&apos;S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLFE?. His body language is quite like some poor puppet being randomly jerked around while the puppeteer tries to shake off LSD-conjured spiders. And the incredibly strange dialogue from a knife-wielding strip joint owner:(attempting to be intimidating, with a crazy gleam in his eye and tossing his switchblade between both of his hands) &quot;Pretty? Pretty?&quot; No one in the history of civilization has ever talked like any of the characters in this film. If you are fortunate enough to have this unjustly out-of-print film at your local video store, not only should you rent it immediately, but you should invite over all of your friends and let them stare at this mess in slack-jawed amazement. A solid 10 on the laughs scale! And you will pee your pants at Tony Bennet&apos;s narration/ performance!!! RENT IT RIGHT NOW, FOR GOD&apos;S SAKE!"

      "reviewBody": "A posh aristocrat&apos;s drunken shuffle through the post-modern, post-structuralist wasteland of post-war Berlin signifies a repudiation of modern ethics and expectations... Prost! Language is no longer a viable method of communication. Excess is no longer a privilege of the upper class. Modernity&apos;s failed pledge for unity built on the preservation of logic and ambition has resulted in the celebration of resignation and the descent into hedonistic splendor. To act irrationally, to reject rational thought, is the only logical continuation in the wake of twentieth-century horrors. The appeal for harmony and beauty through art and culture has been replaced by the promise of temporary happiness and decadence through hollow consumerism; &quot;pleasure gained not by aggression but by regression.&quot; The film poses the question: which is worse? External destruction or spiritual dilution; one is the product of the other, and both are roads that lead to the annihilation of individualism. Ticket to No Return is a beautifully shot and artfully imagined film that is simultaneously profound and ludicrous. Its incessant absurdity is both endearing and insufferable, revealing and isolating. By no means is it thoroughly enjoyable, though it does present the viewer with rich aesthetics and a thought-provoking narrative.",

You know her as an actress from TV-productions and from films as well as performing on the stage. For many the impact of serials like Varuhuset and Rederiet make them easy remember you, but as an actress the work as with Brustna Hjärtan and Strindbergsbarnet is what you hold as precious moments.

      "reviewBody": "Ellie and kid brother Jimmy are driving home late one night through the Hollywood Hills when something huge and monstrous crosses their path. One nasty road accident later, the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds - and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon, brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy, it&apos;s a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie, it&apos;s the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is, and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?\n\n&quot;Cursed&quot; doesn&apos;t take itself very seriously as a horror film, or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be, and hadn&apos;t made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout, and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features, but for the most part this is a silly, airbrushed effort, filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio&apos;s name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes, but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker&apos;s name in the credits, and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?\n\nThis film might have fared better in the 80s, but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I&apos;m just glad I had a free pass, otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.",

      "reviewBody": "I was about 11 when the popular BBC TV series of the day &quot;Doomwatch&quot; aired and vaguely remember watching it at the time. Back then, if a TV show took off it would often be stretched into a film (it still happens today of course, witness &quot;The X Files&quot; or &quot;Sex and the City&quot;), although it was usually comedy shows which got the movie treatment then (&quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads&quot;, &quot; Steptoe and Son&quot; etc) rather than dramas.\n\nSo watching this was like reliving a little of my childhood, but it did live up to my expectations in engaging and entertaining, if not exactly thrilling me. Ian Bannen and Judy Geeson (plus the ever-smooth George Sanders as a Navy bigwig) are added to the normal cast to give a little star-power to proceedings and both acquit themselves well, although the former does look a little silly at times in his chic white skip-cap!\n\nThe plot is reminiscent of the &quot;Damned&quot; pictures of the 60&apos;s but also anticipates &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; in its depiction of an establishment figure exploring a mystery in a closed island community, although the latter of course, played up the horror content and came up with a much more dramatic climax. The direction is satisfactory although I found some of the night scenes to be poorly lit and almost impossible to make out clearly.\n\nThe ecological message at the heart of the show, sorry film comes through loud and clear, but I guess my unintentional slip there confirms the contention that it rarely breaks out of small-screen mode to really pass muster as a cinematic experience. \n\nOne for the living room and not the theatre.",

Starring not only Bette Davis and Lilian Gish, alone worth anybody&apos;s money, well advanced into the autumn of their years, but also a very welcome Vincent Price, and a magnificent Ann Sothern together with her real daughter, Tisha Sterling.\n\nA slow sensitive story in which each one looks back on life from differing perspectives; as usual, Bette Davis is in a dominating rôle, which, despite her advanced years, carries off quite well; Lillian Gish is just superb, lending that toned-down equanimous nature of hers which pervades the whole atmosphere of the film. And as the film develops around their house and in the garden and on the cliff-tops looking out to sea in earnest attempts to see the whales making their way south, the quiet contemplativeness of the film holds you. This is a film you will cherish and savour long afterwards. Which is why it is in my video collection since 1993 and why IMDb contributors 15 years on are still commenting on this heart-warming piece, half a dozen of them only so far this year.\n\nSo as to make a contrast, I suggest that impressive classic &apos;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&apos; (1962), with Bette Davis playing against Joan Crawford: an intense dramatic piece. \n\nJust a few weeks after being invited to the San Sebastián Film Festival  her last public engagement  Bette Davis died, as has Lillian Gish: unrepeatable.",

There are some falls, as the whole &quot;Blacula topic&quot;, but it entertains without holes in the plot, and the final result that you have about German society is good because you see Germans are able to be ironic about their past and they are better than people usually think, about racial integration. In Berlin at least. The last part - the solving one - is a little pour, the perception is that the idea to make a rap band with Eva&apos;s brothers is hasty and not enough introduced during the movie. Last consideration: Alex Morel is very good in acting performances, leaving aside his gorgeous face, without whom I don&apos;t think the drama effect would have been so effective.

      "reviewBody": "The Sphere (1998)\n\nBarry Levinson is one of those directors who has no interest in art, or in invention, or in pretension, either. And so his films sometimes hit a popular strain that makes them take off. He has some terrible misfires, for sure, but his best films (&quot;Rain Man,&quot; &quot;Sleepers&quot;) have people who you relate to, and who have to confront something extraordinary.\n\nThat was the idea here, based on a Michael Crichton novel (that should have been a heads up). The cast is headliner stuff. Dustin Hoffman is particularly convincing, Samuel Jackson plays a great type, and Liev Schreiber is sharp. Sharon Stone is a dull fourth. They bond, and realize they have things in common, in the first minutes of the film as they converge and go under water to check out an alien spaceship. Even after they are deep below the surface and beginning their unlikely exploration they make a viewer connect. As much as it borrows from &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; this could have been a good film on its own terms. Even the talking computer/alien has its own edge compared to HAL.\n\nWhat goes wrong is the plot itself, and not acting, or even directing, can overcome that. As it gets hairier, we need it to be more plausible, not less. Events get increasingly chaotic, so that action and loud noise drive some of the scenes. Subplots are continued but seem increasingly meaningless (at one point, Hoffman and Stone are rushing into the water in an absolute emergency and they start to chitchat about their distant failed love affair). And finally, as people die off and the menace becomes more ambiguous, the movie becomes completely ambiguous, and as a kind of escape valve, announces that any number of crazy thing we have been watching may or may not have been imagined by one character or another.\n\nBut what does that mean about the camera? Isn&apos;t there still a differentiation between cinema reality and one character&apos;s delusion? Or if these are global delusions including the viewer, shouldn&apos;t they do more than simply disorient us? Well, don&apos;t hang on for answers. Just hang on. An explosion (of course) caps it all off (why they didn&apos;t hit the disarm button isn&apos;t explained), and a final logical wrap up that avoids the time travel paradox is warm and fuzzy.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Eagle Huntress&quot; (2016 release from the UK; 87 min.) is a documentary about Aisholpan, a 13 yr. Mongolian girl, and her quest to become the first female eagle huntress. As the movie opens, we are introduced to the wide open spaces of western Mongolia, where eagles have been used for chasing &quot;food and fur&quot; for generations, but until now it was done exclusively by men. We get to know Aisholpan and her family. Her loving and doting dad has noticed his daughter&apos;s interest in eagle hunting and, against the better (?) thinking of certain other men in the local community, decides to train her. At this point we&apos;re 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of what&apos;s about to unfold would spoil your viewing experience, you&apos;ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this documentary is directed by Otto Bell, whom I&apos;ve never heard of before. Not that it matters, as Bell and the entire production crew are &quot;embedded&quot; in Ulgii and the surrounding parts of western Mongolia, with seemingly unrestricted access to Aisholpan and her family. What we get is a heart-warming documentary about a young girl&apos;s determination (encouraged by a loving dad) to become an eagle huntress. Along the way, we get gorgeous footage of the eagle hunters in action (check out the slo-mo footage--pure eye-candy) but also a fascinating look at what daily life is like in this remote part of the world. And in the end, this is also about girl empowerment, pure and simple. Kudos to Aisholpan&apos;s supportive dad (and the rest of the family). When Sia&apos;s original song &quot;Angel by the Wings&quot; plays over the end credits (with the most appropriate line &quot;You Can Do Anything&quot;), I dare you to suppress a smile or approving grin.\n\n&quot;The Eagle Huntress&quot; opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn&apos;t wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise (in the best possible way). Seems there may be a demand for this kind of family-friendly documentary with a deeper message that one might expect at first sight. If you love documentaries, you cannot go wrong with this one. &quot;The Eagle Huntress&quot; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

Mona is an entrepreneur early on when she starts up her own neighborhood delivery business where she works for small amounts of money just to pay for all of the things she purchases in order to someday fulfill her dream, such as braces and pageant classes.  Although Mona does some malicious things throughout the movie, such as letting her friend raise her daughter so that she can still compete and taking a pregnant woman to the hospital in a shopping cart just to get picture in the paper, I think the point that (Sally) Fields&apos; is trying to get across is that she had the desire to achieve her dream, and she never let anything stand in her way on the road there.  It wasn&apos;t easy for Mona, but she made her dreams become a reality, as it is implied that many of the other Miss American Miss contestants had it handed to them.  I just love the ending, one of those movies that made me cry.  I also loved the song at the end by Dee Carstensen, wonderful song.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much and have watched it time and time again with my sister."

      "reviewBody": "Am not somebody who hates Christmas or has a bias against made for television Christmas films. The complete opposite on both counts. Christmas is actually my favourite time of year and always has been for as long as can be remembered. Also love musicals, or at least films music-oriented, and Dolly Parton is always a treat to listen to (deserving of her reputation as a country music legend) and watch. The premise sounded nice enough, though there was the worry of it being cheesy.\n\n&apos;Christmas on the Square&apos; was badly misconceived unfortunately from start to finish in my view. Any potential it had is completely wasted and there are far better representations of Parton, who deserved much better than this, on film and anywhere. Have seen worse Christmas films and overall than &apos;Christmas on the Square&apos; and it has a couple of small good things, but nearly everything fails badly and am saying this with much regret. Speaking as someone who doesn&apos;t like being critical.\n\nThe best thing about &apos;Christmas on the Square&apos; is the spirited performance of Christine Baranski.\n\nIt started quite nicely and the closest the film got to evoking seeing Parton in concert.\n\nSadly cannot say anything good about everything else. On the whole, the acting is too campy and it was like a vast majority of the cast were over-compensating. A case of a cast with solid singing ability but don&apos;t have the goods dramatically. Even Parton doesn&apos;t charm as much as she usually does, although she does look and sound amazing. Being a musician, music is very important for me to talk about and that is lacking here. Ranging from very forgettable to borderline embarrassing with very cheesy and soppy lyrics.\n\nWill agree with those that didn&apos;t care for the choreography or dancing, to me it was too manic and overdone. In fact, pretty much everything about &apos;Christmas on the Square&apos; is manic and has no subtlety whatsoever. The dialogue is very awkward and cheesy, while almost none of the characters are interesting in personality and actually irritate (excepting Baranski&apos;s and that is more to do with her performance). The story is paper thin and suffers from excessive predictability, a hectic to the point of chaos pace and overuse of cheese and froth.\n\nOverall, misconceived and charmless. 2/10.",

These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.\n\nNow I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.\n\nActing was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.\n\nThis movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.\n\nIt&apos;s well worth its ticket price.",
