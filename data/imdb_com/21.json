      "reviewBody": "A misunderstood classic brilliantly shot in b/w in a style reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock.Possibly many are baffled by the way the story is churned out but it follows a definitive pattern leading to the poetical climax.Excellent use of the temples highlightens the subjects of rape and unmarried mothers.Definitely a thinking film though the frequent songs may seem absurd.Madhubala and Nimmi are outstanding.Dilip Kumar&apos;s acting has been misunderstood because his role is opposite to the usual tragic,heroic types he is known for.But the depth he takes his character into is amazing.I rate his acting in this film as the most sophisticated of his career.The music and songs are above average and the script is good.The supporting cast is strong and all excell in their roles.As in all Mehboob films the message here is the downtrodden in society,here a victim of rape left to the mercies of a bigoted community.This film will be hailed in the future because it&apos;s message and style was too complex for its time.",

      "reviewBody": "This is Eisenstein&apos;s directorial debut and alongside Citizen Kane it may be one of the most important debuts in the history of film showcasing a fully-fledged artistic maturity. This is a fictitious narrative-driven movie though it is very consonant with reality. As a Communist Eisenstein&apos;s aesthetics was opposed to the &quot;bourgeois&quot; art style that considered the artistic object as a subject of contemplation. Eisenstein advocated in theoretical terms in his books and practically with movies such as this a pragmatic vision of art. Movies should have a purpose; they should mobilize the viewer into action by filing him with emotion. \n\nThis strategy is obvious early on with the use of the motto from Lenin that links the idea of organized workers and that of social action in an equation of efficiency. The movie tries to prove that the workers are entitled to organization and that only in such a manner they could achieve their full potential. The movie focuses on the workers as a group; there are no &quot;characters&quot; as we have grown accustomed to seeing on screen. The collective character of the workers, though, has a very powerful emotional impact on the viewer because Eisenstein knows how to present it:\n\n1) The workers are presented in the factory, in what would appear to Chaplin, for instance as a medium of alienation. Here, the workers seem &quot;at home&quot; because they are so many they balance the non-human elements expressed by the machines. More than this the brilliant montage sequences emphasize that the workers are in peace in their environment, the visual patters give a clear feeling of the strength of the united workers. Later on with the advent of sound the beauty of an industrial landscape will be extraordinarily depicted by Vertov in Enthusiasm;\n\n2) The workers are contrasted with the fat and greedy capitalists. Their environment is luxurious and far more &quot;human&quot; than a factory. However, Eisenstein makes it appear as a place of sin and debauchery. The cigar smoke emphasizes the strength of the exploiter much like the smoke from the furnace shows the force of the factory. There are many correspondences between the two environments which Eisenstein later uses to achieve some of the greatest and most emotionally engaging associative montages ever displayed. One of the most impressive shows a boss squeezing a lemon to fix himself a drink while the workers are squished by the police forces trying to repress the strike; \n\n3) Individuals predominantly appear only when they are associated with heavy dramatic scenes, the innocent worker who commits suicide ( who only functions as the dramatic instigator of the plot without any real emotion displayed for the actual character who dies even if we know his actual name; it is insinuated that a human life has a meaning only as part of larger community), the child who is killed by the police, the spies who serve as much needed humorous debouches that relieve the tension associated with the workers exploitation but that also build up tension in the sense that they show the stupidity of the bosses and of their methods; \n\n4) The key to the movie is its pragmatics. It is after all a propaganda piece and the ending clearly shows it. The advice addressed to the proletarians not to forget is charged with emotion because it discharges a tension that has been carefully build frame by frame at a rampant pace. Even if we disengage with his doctrine we should keep in mind that Eisenstein&apos;s genius can only be acknowledged in its cultural context and related to his conception of art&apos;s function in a society. We can screen out the propaganda but we must keep the emotion in order to understand this movie today at its full power.",

You cannot get much closer, I would think, to the flying birds than what you see here. Cameras were literally attached to some of the birds so you, the viewer, are up there in the sky right with these (mainly) geese as they migrant thousands of miles.\n\nThe colors are beautiful and the sound is good. However, be warned there is no dialog so it can be tough viewing the whole 90 minutes in one sitting. Also, I found the best and most interesting footage at the beginning.\n\nNevertheless, this is a good addition to anyone&apos;s collection if or no other reason than the magnificent photography and the effort filmmakers put out to make this wildlife documentary. It also is interesting how they show different species every few minutes, where they go each year, how many miles they travel, the exact route, etc. Wildlife and bird-lovers in particular, should love this film.",

The movie has a real sense: to prove that to stupid guys can save the world, but they won&apos;t do it on purpose. It is exactly the opposite of the US films where everybody is wonderful and intelligent... The guide line shows that not everybody is great and can make everything he wants. It is the contrary of the American Dream, and that&apos;s why most people that are now guided by that dream, don&apos;t like this film You should watch &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and if you find a sense to that, you&apos;ll find a sense to &quot;Double Zero&quot;.",

What a treat to see two of my favorite stage stars Michael Countryman and Tony-Winner Elizabeth Franz turning in excellent performances in this mini-movie. Countryman plays a mama&apos;s boy engaged to be married, much to his seamstress mom&apos;s (Franz) dismay. Seems daddy died in a mysterious hunting accident and the house is a taxidermist&apos;s dream house. Mom sews up a wolf&apos;s suit for son&apos;s community theatre &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;, but the lupine skin suit somehow doesn&apos;t stay on the wardrobe rack after the final curtain. While the film is pithy and well shot, my thoughts couldn&apos;t help but turn to the recent HBO documentary on &apos;furries&apos; - a subculture of folks who dress in animal suits for prurient pleasures. Perhaps that&apos;s not where the film wants us to go, but the whole affair is decidedly loopy, so why not?",

      "reviewBody": "Bad sequels are especially painful when their predecessors were brilliant and mesmerizing films. Like in the case of &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, which was the most controversial shocker in years and probably the only film of the recent Asia-mania that was worth the hype it caused. BR featured a simply absurd story and exploitative violence, yet it worked. The sequel, for some reason, wants to be more ambitious and turns the premise into a gigantic anti-war campaign. Sole survivor Shuya Nanahara of part one has become a feared terrorized who declared war to all adults but, instead of responding, the government sends a fresh shipment of adolescents with death-collars over to the hideout island of Shuya in order to annihilate him. The only really good sequences are almost exact copies of situations that already took place in part one (a giant amount of nasty collar-explosions) but the shock-effect is gone. I normally have sympathy for filmmakers that try something new instead of re-telling the original but in this case the director should have optioned for a screenplay that harped more on the same successful idea. Something&apos;s also pretty wrong with the regularity and structure of this film. The first 45 minutes are stuffed with hard-boiled action, featuring for example a Saving Private Ryan-like coast-storming. But then the boredom kicks in and the story begins to live up to its extra title: &quot;Requiem&quot;. Endlessly irritating friendship speeches, tedious morality and unnecessary flashbacks completely ruin the tempo of the film and you literally have to struggle yourself through every remaining minute that&apos;s left. 134 minutes is way too long for a film like this, by the way. The whole BR2 project is an incompetent mess and not at all recommended. It&apos;s too idiotic too pass for a war epic and far too moralizing to become a controversial cult flick.",

      "reviewBody": "I just watched this movie again, this time on the Sci-Fi channel, and I came on here to see what others thought.  Frankly, I&apos;m surprised it has such a low rating on here.  It&apos;s certainly not flawless, but I think it&apos;s actually pretty darn good.  There really wasn&apos;t anything BAD about it, either--nothing really to complain about at all.  The acting was all pretty well done; perhaps not Oscar-winning, but not unbelievable at all.  The plot, dialogue, and story all made sense too.  The special effects--though there weren&apos;t really much of these to comment on--were all better than you&apos;d expect for a movie you&apos;d see on TV, and even the prop corpses looked reasonably as you&apos;d expect them to look.  I was impressed at how logical they made it all: the way the cargo system on the ship worked, the way the ship computer interacted with them, the way they moved around outside the ship (it didn&apos;t look like they were on strings when they were slightly hovering around), the way they realistically handled all of the situations, everything.  Seriously, this movie isn&apos;t bad at all.  It&apos;s certainly not the MOST creative or original movie out there, but I really don&apos;t understand why anyone would give it a 4.8/10 (which is the user rating on here at the time of me writing this).  Although I would find it hard for someone to say this is their FAVORITE movie, it certainly shouldn&apos;t get anything lower than a 6. Personally, I&apos;m giving it a 7.  It&apos;s entertaining, pretty well acted and written, and it doesn&apos;t contain any gratuitous gore, nudity, or foul language either to bring down its quality level.  Heck, it&apos;s even thought-provoking. *shrugs*  I like it, and if you like sci-fi movies (or even if you don&apos;t), I bet you&apos;d probably like it too.  Don&apos;t let the abnormally low user rating scare you, this is a good movie.  Oh, and it&apos;s not a creature flick either--there are no monsters or aliens or anything to make it hokey.  It&apos;s a pretty good movie, try it out for yourself."

As for &apos;horror&apos;?, I didn&apos;t see any. Not even remotely. Just a lot of disjointed scenes, no atmosphere, no chemistry, nothing to talk about. I enjoyed Aiysha Hart in her scenes, speaking Arabic; those were high points of the film for me. poor Razane looked at sea most of the time. Shame. Could have been a much better film with more effort from the director, imagination and maybe even a bigger budget...? Most of the story was predictable. There was little emotional content even around the theme of the dead baby. There was no atmosphere to connect the so called &apos;horror&apos; to any emotional response by the actors. All very disconnected.Worth watching for the Arabic language scenes.",

      "reviewBody": "From the other comments {as of 2001 when I first wrote about this film here} you might think &quot;Fogi is a Bastard&quot; is a total loser film; but I think those others missed the boat on this one. It remains the #1 film I&apos;d like to own on video, one that actually breaks new ground in examining a hot, if dysfunctional, gay love affair. For me, it was the best film at OUTFEST 1999; and even though as a film it probably is not a masterpiece, as a gay film it is so amazing and mind blowing that it has replaced &quot;Law of Desire&quot; (by Almodòvar), as my all-time favorite gay film. Vincent Branchet plays Beni, a schoolboy in 1974 Switzerland, who develops a crush on Fogi the notoriously gay lead singer/guitarist of a local punk band, &quot;The Minks&quot;. They form a relationship which starts out as innocent puppy dog attraction with wonderful sex, and which devolves to heavy sado-masochism as Fogi descends into heroin addiction and starts hiring out Beni as a call-boy and treating the willing and cooperative Beni as his dog (too bad the more apropos title, &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot; was already taken). It sounds unpromising, I know. Yet the film is such an unsparingly realistic portrayal; the actors so outstanding (Branchet is both the most attractive young actor and one of the best actors period that I&apos;ve seen in several years; and Frederic Andrau, who plays Fogi is no slouch, himself) that it all works. The film is beautifully shot in a realistic, gritty style with a very mobile camera which defies description (a scene where the characters have dropped LSD and the whirling camera is used as a metaphor for their internal state is simply stunning.) It is exciting and innovative film making, and the director Marcel Gisler is one to watch for. This is a film I would go back to see over and over if it were ever to get a release here.\n\nI finally got to see this film again on DVD in March, 2012; and the film has lost none of its power to shock and amaze. Twelve years have passed since I saw it, and still no other filmmaker has managed to make a gay themed dramatic film which so ardently and truthfully managed to capture the unvarnished essence of the sex, drugs and Gothic Rock gay culture of the &apos;70s. This film might have been set in Switzerland; but it could have been set anywhere that gay people congregated in that pre-AIDS, post-Stones era. This film remains a milestone of the gay cinema and deserves its place in the canon.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an exciting and suspenseful , though mediocre Fu Manchu movie , but still enjoyable . It&apos;s a little boring , but is better than following entries , the low-budgeted and lackluster Jess Frank movies : ¨Kiss of the dead¨ and ¨The castle of Fumanchu¨ which most critics felt were the weakest of the series .\n\nThe co-protagonist is Nyland Smith , finely played by Douglas Wilmer -character also interpreted by Nigel Green and Richard Greene- ; he&apos;s a good English actor , usually playing in secondary roles -El Cid- , here he is the starring and is very well . The baddies are Horst Frank , a German actor usually playing as the villain-role and Christopher Lee , as always acting as a magnificent evil-doer . As usual , there appears Howard Marion Crawford who is the assistant of Nyland Smith , a Watson-alike . And of course , the Fu Manchu&apos;s daughter , habitually played by T Sai Chin , acting perfectly as a nasty murderous.\n\nIn the film there are action , adventures , thriller , sadism and exotic outdoors filmed in China , because being produced by the Chinese Shaw Brothers and Harry Allan Towers (producer of the Fu Manchu&apos;s five movies) . The movie will appeal those have seen the different entries and Christopher Lee fans ; the best installments are directed by Don Sharp : ¨Face of Fu Manchu (1965)¨ and ¨Brides of Fu Manchu(1966)¨. Rating : Average but entertaining .",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d seen the remake Outcast Lady before I rented the original silent version A Woman of Affairs. In both stories, the plot is heavily censored from the novel, but if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s been cut it still seems entertaining and complex.\n\nIn this cast, Greta Garbo is in love with her childhood friend, John Gilbert, but his father doesn&apos;t approve. When he sends his son away for a years-long business trip, Greta retaliates by marrying her brother&apos;s best friend, Johnny Mack Brown. On their wedding night, Johnny gets upset and commits suicide, but since Greta refuses to tell anyone why he was so upset, everyone assumes it was her fault. Her brother, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., in particular, blames her and accuses her of confessing sinful secrets to Johnny that made him rather die than face a life with her. Greta is banished, and Doug Jr. drinks to drown his sorrows. Only one man continually stands up for her, her pal Lewis Stone, who might harbor more than friendship in his heart.\n\nIn both versions, the woman&apos;s character doesn&apos;t really make sense. You can get past her marrying a man she doesn&apos;t love because she believes the man she does love has forgotten her, but accepting a banishment and terrible reputation when a simple explanation could have cleared things up doesn&apos;t make much sense. And after such a terrible scandal, for which she is blamed, it hardly makes sense to turn into a hussy. Why is that the answer to her problems? The rest of it is a good old-fashioned melodrama, so if you like soapy plots like that, you&apos;ll probably like to see one of the versions. Having seen both, I actually prefer the silent movie to the talkie. The story is simple and doesn&apos;t need a lot of dialogue, and since it&apos;s so over-the-top, it makes sense to have over-the-top acting to go along with it.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to start off by stating this review is much based on personal preference. Obviously user reviews are like that by design but in this case it might even be more true than usual. It IS one of the &quot;love it or hate it&quot; movies par excellence.\n\nI did indeed love the movie overall - actually so very much i was drawn to write my first review after reading user opinions here on IMDb for half my life.\n\nIf you are regularly inspired by atmospheric dense movies rather than character portraits or clever plot twists this might be one for you. The driving force behind the movie to me was the almost mythical world it was able to create. The setting is a small northern german coastal village. The sea, the coastline and the bleak countryside are painted in grey and blue color scheme that gave the nature around the town a harsh, almost life repelling feel.\n\nBut predominantly is the feeling of emptiness delivered by the open skies, the clear fields and the sea with no end in sight. This is beautifully intertwined with the main plot, the disappearance of the ocean.\n\nAnother key of what might have made this movie work so well is the excellent score. I cannot stress this fact too much. It is what makes a movie of this type work or not. Generally i was drawn to movies with a music that supports certain aspects of a movie, be it by creating tension or just by giving it a certain underlying tone the director wanted the movie to have - Hans Zimmers work in &quot;Interstellar&quot; comes to mind as the latest example.\n\nAll other aspects of the movie fall off in comparison to the quality of the above described - and the other reviewers maybe right to focus on that. The lead acting is mediocre, not bad. I did like some of the sidecast (especially Karl). The general plot idea is actually quiet imaginative. The camera work is, as far i can judge, beyond standard if not actually really good. The underlying, later presented moral conclusion of the movie felt heavy handed and daft on one side - then again the movie never aimed to be a philosophical epitom.\n\n...You don&apos;t get a movie that just lives off panoramic scenes. You get a movie full with human interaction, be it loss, grief or love, which is uplifted by the intense atmospheric background this movie was able to deliver.",

Themroc is a movie with no dialogue so that it can be seen by any human around the world and still understand how authority has separated us and divided us in order to use us. Themroc is an ode to symbolism, a prime example of how you can do political commentary and show to people that freedom is easy to attain and that half measures is the mean authority uses to control us. More than that, Themroc examines human sexuality, sexism, exploitation and the limitations modern society has set for us thus limiting our life experience and happiness.\n\nI absolutely recommend watching it if you manage to fin this film. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Turning away from the epic scale of his quintessential movies, Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, director D. W. Griffith turned to an altogether smaller and more intimate story in 1919. Instead of telling a vast tale spanning millennia and featuring a cast of thousands, he focused his attention on the tragic interplay between just three people: a Chinese immigrant to London (Richard Barthelmess), a young waif with whom he develops a brief but touching relationship (Lillian Gish), and her brutish father (Donald Crisp). It&apos;s been suggested this was another sop by Griffith to those who had accused him of being a racist due to the content of BoaN although, while Bathelmess&apos; Chinese immigrant is a completely sympathetic character, the thoughtless racist attitudes that were commonplace back then are still very much in evidence. For example, the movie&apos;s secondary title is &apos;The Yellow Man and the Girl&apos;, and during a tender love scene, Gish&apos;s Lucy says to him: &quot;Why are you so good to me, Chinky?&quot;  which tends to break the mood just a tad.\n\nGriffith&apos;s trademark use of tiny gestures and changes of expression is very much in evidence in the performances of Barthelmess and Gish, while Crisp, who is barely recognisable as the kindly patriarch of countless 40s flicks, paints a broader picture of the loutish Battling Burrows. This counterpoint between screen father and daughter works well, stressing the fragile nature of Gish&apos;s waif, while emphasising the misery of her dependence upon her uncouth father. Barthelmess, meanwhile  spends much of his time gazing miserably at the bleakness of the world around him as his character tries to lose himself in a haze of opium after failing to spread the word of peace. Chen seems to be moving through a dream for much of the film, passively allowing himself to be buffered by the world, and only shaking himself from his torpor when Lucy almost literally falls at his feet. This scene, in which Lucy and Chen first meet, is wonderfully atmospheric and beautifully framed and is, strangely, the prelude to the film&apos;s weakest segment. Having set the scene beautifully and created a great atmosphere, Griffith allows proceedings to slip into melodrama. While Battling&apos;s discovery of Lucy&apos;s new friendship is melodrama of the most Victorian kind, the relationship between the two potential lovers goes nowhere which, while perhaps true to the film&apos;s title, leaves the story struggling for momentum. Lucy enjoys a few hours of being spoiled by Chen  the first time in her life that she ever has been, but there is very little interaction between them, and Chen&apos;s apparent consideration of forcing himself on Lucy before finally kissing her sleeve really doesn&apos;t ring true at all. In fact, the scene looks as if it were added almost as an afterthought to inject a little suspense.\n\nNevertheless, BROKEN BLOSSOMS is another example of one of the world&apos;s greatest directors operating at somewhere close to the top of his game. In another few years, Griffith&apos;s Victorian viewpoint would look horribly outdated to the Roaring Twenties crowd. There were still more classics to come, but in terms of technical and creative accomplishment he had already peaked.",

      "reviewBody": "My friends and I started watching Big Mama&apos;s House 2 a couple months ago, but we never got to finish, and in some ways I was glad because I usually like to see the first film before I see the sequel. Most times you feel like you have missed out on so much and you might not understand the humor. So I rented Big Mama&apos;s House and was sorely disappointed, I was really nervous and was thinking that maybe I didn&apos;t want to see the second one. But my friend insisted that I see it and to give it a shot.\n\nMalcom is back and this time he&apos;s a safety teacher who has felt like he&apos;s lost his edge, but he has made a promise to his wife since she is pregnant. But when he finds out there is an investigation on a top secret defense CD being released to some very bad men, he goes undercover as Big Mama to be the man who has the CD and his family. He lies to his wife and work and the family he is caring for, but ends up saving the day for everyone.\n\nI have to say that I honestly laughed a lot more in the second Big Mama&apos;s House more than the first one. This one seemed just more light hearted and it was fun, despite it being predictable, I think more should give this movie a better chance, because in my opinion this was better and well thought out more than the first.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "I wondered at the start of the film why it should need to display an Adult rating certificate; but in dealing with famine and starvation it pulls no punches and delivers some fairly distressing images. The documentation of post-war devastation in Europe and simultaneous climate disruption in the East is still powerful, and a real eye-opener to those of us brought up with stories of victory and happy-ever-after. The condemnation of excess and black-market luxuries is evangelical in its scorn.\n\nAs with most of Rotha&apos;s work that I&apos;ve seen, there is a strong didactic message attached, and it is this polemical edge that I tend to find wears less well. In the case of this film, the argument being made is for the FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, intended to promote what would later be dubbed &quot;the green revolution&quot; -- an era of industrialised farming across the world to provide food for all. The irony is that, as we know, it didn&apos;t succeed in eliminating man-made famine, and produced unintended side-effects: the modern-day FAO advocates &apos;simple, sustainable tools and techniques&apos; instead of mass irrigation and mechanization, and it&apos;s sometimes hard to watch this hopeful propaganda from a more optimistic age. \n\nWatching films like this, however, reminds us just *why* such an emphasis was placed on increasing production at any cost, and the message still holds true today: shortage and starvation brings conflict, unrest, and ultimately renewed war. In 1947, the aim above all was to avoid the mistakes that had brought another world conflict within a generation of the first one.",

      "reviewBody": "The story starts with an interesting premise but soon goes overboard in depicting some gory scenes of a ghost&apos;s vengeance during which time much blood is shed for the sake of horror fans who like this sort of thing. It&apos;s well acted and tense with some quietly underplayed opening scenes, but once the ghost starts wreaking the place all hell breaks loose and the story loses a great deal of credibility.\n\nThe acting is fine, with Famke Janssen giving a strong performance as a woman forced to wear an ankle bracelet and kept under close watch by a suspicious policeman who was her husband&apos;s partner. But the tension doesn&apos;t become tight until the last third of the story and then it goes way over the top in depicting violence.\n\nScary enough but midway through, the story loses a lot of credibility despite the high quality of the performances.",

Direction by Venkat Prabhu without much loop-holes,It was nice to hear Arjun and Ajith referring to each other as &quot;Action King&quot; and &quot;Thala&quot; in the movie,respectively.\n\nSome -ves::A little drag in the first half,Some songs(Vaada Bin Laada,Balle Laka)seemed unnecessary and dull although the others were simply superb(Vilaiyadu Mankatha,Nee Naan,Machi Open The Bottle).\n\nVerdict::Mankatha is an example of all essential elements of a commercial entertainer-Action,Comedy,Music,Good Leads,Direction and Technical Perfection ,joining hands with each other.A must watch if you love entertainers.After all,its Mankatha Da&quot;Ma Rating::8.5/10\n\n-Afsal"

Certainly, the focus of the film is at the end where the primary character proposes making this film to Woody, who has played a filmmaker. This directly self-referential device is bold, and could have been part of a fine web, as several other filmmakers have created.\n\nBut the problem is that we&apos;re given pretty thin broth up until that point. Woody tries to be as honestly raw as Chekhov and as deeply symbolic as Kafka. Instead we get a sophomoric effort.\n\nGod&apos;s eyes are mentioned a dozen times. And the protagonist is an eye doctor who is treating a rabbi who goes blind. `Get it?&apos; Woody shouts. To set up the self-referential last scene, we are treated to Woody playing an unappreciated filmmaker making a film inspired by a Jewish philosopher who seems happy but is not. `Get it?&apos; Woody nudge nudges. To underscore that in the theater, we are the eyes of God, Woody bluntly demonstrates by inserting his own viewing of films and philosophizing about film.\n\n This is not intelligent filmmaking, my friends. It is the clumsiness of someone smart enough to see what art is, but not clever enough to create it. Maybe he thinks 90% of creating art is showing up.\n\nAlong the way, we get an interesting performance from Alda. But it is all too obvious that every character&apos;s dialog is Woody&apos;s and they are acting just as Woody has demonstrated to them. Check out their mannerisms. Maybe his comedies will be better. His books are excellent."

      "reviewBody": "Peckinpah&apos;s &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; is a rich, haunting, yet demanding work that, above everything else, sees Billy as a creature of his day and age \n\nHe is by no means made a wholly sympathetic character, but who was sympathetic in the New Mexico of 1881? Peckinpah has most of his characters dyed with violence and sniffing the prevailing air of corruptionthe chief protagonists, their filthy henchmen, even the onlookers \n\nWhere and what is the law? No one seems to know or care Garrett and Billy have seen both sides, like almost everyone else\n\nAnd among the confusion and violence that is the legacy of range war there is no gleam of purifying light in the efforts we see being made to clean up the territory The powers that be want Billy out of New Mexico, not for ethical reasons, but rather so that things can be neatly protected for the approaching business exploitation\n\nGarrett is the man made sheriff to hunt him down and thereby the man who compromises . . . &apos;This country&apos;s getting older and I aim to grow old with it ... there&apos;s an age in a man&apos;s life when he has to consider what&apos;s going to happen next.&apos;\n\nBut Billy can&apos;t compromise It&apos;s not his way &quot;Billy, they don&apos;t like you to be so free!&quot; proclaims the Bob Dylan theme song, summing up why the power men find Billy so irritating Perhaps that&apos;s why Garrett who has sold out to power is in some ways a reluctant hunter He salutes Billy&apos;s spirithis very own personal declaration of independencebut he knows it&apos;s not the spirit of the new times\n\nIt says much for Peckinpah&apos;s way with actors that he gets such admirable performances out of the comparatively inexperienced Kris Kristofferson, as Billy, and Bob Dylan, as Billy&apos;s mate It says just as much for his Westerns perceptiveness that he relies even more heavily on experience The well-tried James Coburn is both solid and hard to define as Garrett And then there are the others who know their way around Westerns so wellKaty Jurado, Slim Pickens, R. G. Armstrong, Jason Robards, Jack Elam, Chill Wills There&apos;s not a single performance here that isn&apos;t a rounded-off portrait in its own right\n\nIt all adds up to a richness in characterization that is matched by the richness of marvelously composed scenes in which interiors and exteriors alike have been put together with loving care and attention to detail, whether it&apos;s a big set-piece &apos;shoot-up&apos; or a close-up of a can of preserveshow such a can looked in 1881\n\nGarrett&apos;s hunt for Billy is told mainly in set-pieces and it has to be said that Peckinpah makes little narrative concession to an audience in the way they are strung together But for the out and out Western fan this is a most memorable movie",

      "reviewBody": "When a farmer is murdered he unexpectedly wills his farm and all his belongings to his 10 peasants, 7 of which decide, even more unexpectedly, to keep the farm and try to run it themselves despite the scorn and outrage of the &quot;legitimate&quot; farmers. Thus, they become the &quot;one-seventh farmers&quot; in this second feature length movie by prominent Austrian writer/director Stefan Ruzowitzky. A beautifully made movie about class struggles, injustice and vain arrogance (among other things), Die Siebtelbauern is also not a film that unravels the way you&apos;d like it too (thus, it isn&apos;t really for everyone). This is quite a bleak film, but it is also extremely engaging as you truly feel for the characters, who were all wonderfully acted. Also serving the film perfectly is its beautiful music, consisting mainly of haunting piano pieces which set the tone very well. Most amusing of all is a well-made nod by Ruzowitzky to First Blood (aka the first Rambo movie) towards the end of the film, which you&apos;re likely to appreciate if you&apos;ve seen said film. All in all, while it isn&apos;t essential viewing, this is a splendidly crafted little film, very engaging, beautiful, realistic and dark, and at least on par with Ruzowitzky latest, the Oscar-winning WW2 prison film Die Fälscher (The Counterfeiters).",

      "reviewBody": "1941&apos;s &quot;Man Made Monster&quot; is noteworthy for a number of reasons, chiefly that this was the Universal feature debut for Lon Chaney Jr. (previously used only in a couple of serials). Having scored an acting triumph just twelve months earlier in &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; the Chaney name had become a bankable one for a studio hoping to replace the departed Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi never even considered. Intended to be a Karloff-Lugosi followup to &quot;The Invisible Ray&quot; (John P. Fulton&apos;s glowing effects retained from that film), Chaney plays the sympathetic role earmarked for Boris, but tailored more to Lon&apos;s strengths, while top billing was accorded to Lionel Atwill, essaying Lugosi&apos;s role, in what Forrest J. Ackerman astutely described as &apos;the maddest doctor of them all.&apos; So frequently shunted aside in supporting parts thereafter, Atwill truly revels in some ace scenery chewing; in one scene, Lon asks about the now missing test rabbit: &quot;oh, he worked yesterday!&quot; It would be difficult to imagine Boris Karloff as an ordinary Joe performing electrical tricks for &apos;yokel shockers,&apos; so completely does Chaney inhabit this good natured, unsuspecting dupe, Dan McCormick, having survived an accident that left all other passengers dead, now utilized as the perfect guinea pig for the power hungry experiments conducted by Atwill&apos;s Dr. Paul Rigas. This would be the last time Atwill enjoyed top billing in any Hollywood picture, and though he did future mad doctors in &quot;The Mad Doctor of Market Street,&quot; &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein,&quot; and &quot;Pardon My Sarong,&quot; he never again showed such a devious glint in his eyes. Perfectly cast are lovely Anne Nagel, female lead opposite Lugosi in &quot;Black Friday,&quot; and dependable Samuel S. Hinds, always believable no matter what the dialogue. Still, after nearly a decade in Hollywood, mostly in bit parts, this must have been a revelation for Lon Chaney, who had done only &quot;One Million B. C.&quot; and &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; since his triumph as Lennie Small; apparently studios were still unsure of his overall talent. Luckily, Universal allowed him to broaden himself as their resident horror star during the prolific WW2 years, the busiest period of his career, and one where he made many lifelong friends. Included in Universal&apos;s popular SHOCK! package of classic horror films issued to television in the late 50s, &quot;Man Made Monster&quot; surprisingly appeared only four times on Pittsburgh&apos;s Chiller Theater- July 29 1967 (preceded by 1935&apos;s &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;), Mar 17 1973 (followed by 1962&apos;s &quot;The Horrible Dr. Hichcock&quot;), July 27 1974 (preceded by 1965&apos;s &quot;Women of the Prehistoric Planet&quot;), and Jan 21 1978 (following 1955&apos;s &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;).",

      "reviewBody": "Elia Kazan: An Outsider (1982) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nThis hour long documentary has director Elia Kazan talking about his life and films. The director starts off talking about his early life and how he eventually got interested in acting, which of course leads to the Actor&apos;s Studio. From here he talks about his greatest films, his controversial testimony and some of the failures that hit his later films.\n\nDocumentaries like this are now pretty priceless because it gives us a chance to hear from a legendary director. There have been many documentaries done on Kazan but this here allows the man to speak for himself and share his opinions on acting, his films and some of his life&apos;s disappointments. The documentary has him revisiting where ON THE WATERFRONT was made, which was a lot of fun and he even talks about the tips he gave Robert DeNiro on THE LAST TYCOON. DeNiro is also briefly interviewed here as he discusses the director.\n\nSome of the highlights include Kazan talking about some of his later films and the disappointments they were at the box office. This includes America America and THE APPOINTMENT. He also talks about Broadway and his love of writing. Kazan was 72 at the time and he knocks on wood at one point saying he hopes to get a few more things done before he dies. As we know, he ended up living a long time but it&apos;s worth noting that the three film projects he hoped to do were never completed."

I do agree that it is predictable, the plot is nothing particularly special and the ending especially doesn&apos;t really hold any surprises. But it is nicely filmed, with evergreen cinematography and pretty scenery and the music is pleasant. The script is good on the most part, there are some humorous parts but it is also somewhat touching, and the director Stephen Herek pitches the humour and melodrama at the right level. And the acting is spirited, with Emilio Estevez charming, dignified and fun as the disgraced lawyer who has to coach the worst ice hockey team and Joss Ackland solid as Hans. Also the ice-hockey scenes are done with just the right amount of flair. Overall, a sweet and fun movie, even with the predictable plot it is worth seeing. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

It, in no way seems to be connected, other than the name Leatherface.\n\nAs far as slasher movies go with legends like Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Norman Bates etc., this film fits in well. Here Leatherface is a madman who seems to have a blood lust not to mention the mind of a madman as opposed to the mind of a retarded person as he had on the first two. I hated this Leatherface really, but enjoyed him as a killer. After just a little while I forgot about the Sawyer family and enjoyed this movie for what it was and I really liked it.\n\nBottom line is this....this move was a great film if you enjoy movies like FRIDAY THE 13TH if not then don&apos;t watch it. It&apos;s not at all like the first two TCM&apos;s so don&apos;t expect a sequel, but the cast is awesome and still full of psychotic characters. \n\n8 out of 10 stars",

Charlize Theron plays down-and-out Jolene, who dumps her daughter Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) on her brother James (Nick Stahl) and disappears. James now has to reconsider how he has lived his whole life.\n\nThe wintry setting in this movie has the same effect as the setting in &quot;Affliction&quot;: as bleak as can be...especially after what ends up happening after James and Tara go on the road. Definitely not a film that will leave you feeling good. Not to demean the movie at all; I do recommend it. You just have to understand that this is a VERY depressing one, exactly the sort of movie to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. I don&apos;t know whether or not you&apos;ll like it, but I still encourage you to at least check it out. Also starring Dennis Hopper, Woody Harrelson and Mathew St. Patrick (who played Keith on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;). I assume that director William Maher is not the same as Bill Maher of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;.",

Low-brow fun, an adaptation of Robert Hill&apos;s play &quot;The Besieged Heart&quot;, with steamy clinches and page after page of florid dialogue. Director Joseph Pevney seems to be a perfect match for Crawford: he&apos;s obviously tough on the unyielding actress and doesn&apos;t let her get away with many &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;-isms. Crawford also seems to have been personally swayed by hunky Chandler, who doesn&apos;t let her hog the spotlight. However, neither star is guided with a trace of self-effacing humor, which turns the proceedings into straight-faced camp. Some of the lines are howlers. **1/2 from ****",

Carole Bouquet, famous for Bunuel&apos;s &quot;Obscure Object of Desire&quot; and arriving straight from shooting the James Bond movie &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, played her most memorable role - a mad person in a mad world - in this tormenting vision of Werner Schroeter, who certainly was neither trying to make an accessible picture nor to avoid anything shocking.

      "reviewBody": "Re-make are seldom as good as the original, but here Hollywood or rather John Sturges managed to capture some of the spirit of Kurosawa&apos;s &apos;Seven Samurai&apos; which itself owes something to the &apos;Three Musketeers&apos; and which Sturges duly acknowledged in the credits. Partly this is due to some inspired casting. With the exception of Yul Brynner, none of the actors was particularly well known at the time. Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Eli Wallach and Horst Buchholz (an unlikely Mexican) all went on to successful acting careers. The format of this film was replicated in many later films. \n\nThe plot couldn&apos;t be simpler. Desperate Mexican villagers, bled white by local bandits, retain a group of almost equally desperate gunslingers from the other side of the Rio Grand to deal with the bandits. A lot of the fun arises early on as leader Cajun Chris seeks out half a dozen suitably deranged but deadly types for the job. Ostensibly they are doing it for the money but it becomes apparent early on that they are really on the team just for the hell of it. Once they are together things don&apos;t quite go to plan, but the camaraderie holds up, and their mission is accomplished, though at considerable cost.\n\nDespite all the action it is a character-driven piece in some ways. Eli Wallach&apos;s Calvera the bandit leader is more than a cardboard cut-out villain and Yul Brynner&apos;s enigmatic Chris keeps us guessing. The villagers, despite their matching white smocks, are not all lily-white and each of the Seven has at least one interesting weakness.\n\nA strong feature of the film is the music, penned by the ubiquitous Elmer Bernstein, and entirely appropriate, with a main theme which seems to be permanently welded into my brain.\n\n&apos;The Magnificent Seven&apos; was made at a time when the appetite for westerns was going into decline. Whereas westerns were staple film and TV fare in the 50&apos;s, the sixties saw a sharp decline, as spy dramas and sex farces burgeoned. One interesting theory I&apos;ve heard about this is that it&apos;s not so much that the audience tired of westerns, but that TV executives discovered that they were being watched by the people too poor to buy their sponsor&apos;s fine products. Anyway this film holds up very well after 45 years, a true classic and satisfying to watch."

They are all in a tent. The camera holder is in a sleeping bag. So who is holding the camera? Also, if this is found footage, what is there music and sounds during the &quot;boo&quot; moments? It was questions like these that made it hard for me to get into. It was pretty slow, but I appreciate the slow burn kinda movie, so that didn&apos;t bug me too much. The acting was solid.

      "reviewBody": "This movie is far better than some of the reviews indicate. One reviewer rightly said that good films like The Thing or The Man from Planet X were made at the same time, but the comparison is faulty. The Flying Saucer was a one-off by Mikel Conrad who starred in it, wrote the storyline, directed and produced; it seems to be his only writer-director-producer credit. TMFPX was extremely low budget but used far superior actors. And Thing was a Howard Hawks production with a top-notch cast and crew; many of the scenes, judging by dialogue and action alone, seemed to have been directed by Hawks even though he is not credited. Compare The Flying Saucer to the many other sci-fi flicks of the early fifties and it holds up a little better. Except for interiors, the entire film was shot on location in Alaska – so you get a great look at the 1949 Alaska environment around Juneau, Spring Lake, and Taku Glacier. And a number of boats, docks, cabins, and float planes from that era. I found the storyline interesting – a scientist builds a saucer (From alien plans? This question is left to the viewer&apos;s imagination) that both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. want to get a hold of. The saucer was a good MacGuffin. Acting was stiff at times, but this was a pro- sumer production. Still, it was worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "The camera captures serious and funny moments (sometimes both at the same) of three young (15 year old I think) girls who have grown up in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The movie is able to shorten the distance to its three main characters without losing feeling for the serious problems they will have to face on their way to adulthood. Besides that, there&apos;s plenty of typical problems of teenagers in puberty in it, so it has a somewhat nostalgic note, too. Overall it is well done and succeeds in presenting an entertaining movie which will still give you enough to think about. Especially the three girls (my favourite being the cheeky Tanutscha) make this movie worth watching. Of course there is a price to pay: Sitting in a cinema with plenty of South-German, pseudo-intellectual and -alternative students in their 20s or early 30s, giving me the feeling they are laughing at the expense of the under-privileged while never taking serious what these pretty tough girls have to say. &quot;Muschis&quot; Tanutscha would call them, I think. She is right.",

Sadly it turns out to be a pretty poor effort all round. The acting is good from all the young cast but the story is non existent and the fx and production values are bargain basement. The aliens look terrible and the faces just look like a Halloween mask with no moveable features. Gore wise it&apos;s very tame and apart from the odd moment it doesn&apos;t deliver much of anything. I like to support small indi horror but even at 75 mins it&apos;s a chore to get through.",

      "reviewBody": "Manoel de Oliveira started his career with the excellent &quot;Aniki Bóbó&quot;, but then went on to do dozens of experimental movies that, for the most part, were failed efforts at a philosophical reflection. This is an exception. Here, Oliveira mixes quotes from Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche, the Bible and the Portuguese José Régio and puts them in the mouths of people that live in a psychiatric hospital. The result is a reflection on morality, religion and Europe, which is sometimes serious, sometimes provocative, and sometimes comedic. I have to admit that, not being familiar with the works cited, a lot of references were probably lost on me. But, then again, a script should be good enough to stand on its own and not require people to read thousands of pages of books to understand it. My first criticism is, therefore, the difficulty of understanding just exactly what is going on. Often, I found that there were some beautiful images and great lines, but that I couldn&apos;t figure out what the message was supposed to be. The acting is good enough to make this a good movie and far superior to the normal in Oliveira&apos;s movies. Miguel Guilherme is great as always, as is Maria de Medeiros, and it is delightful to see the master of comedy Manuel Viegas play the cynical philosopher (Nietzsche), a role that fits him perfectly. Maria João Pires, one of the world&apos;s best pianists, also makes an apparition here, mostly to play the piano, and holds her own very well. Some members of the cast are just so so, but none are bad, which is not usual in an Oliveira movie. Still, I have to point out the cast as a second source of criticism, as sometimes it stands in the way of the story (most notably, in the story of Adam and Eve). The movie comes very close to being excellent but comes short due to the failings I&apos;ve mentioned. All in all, a movie recommended for those who like philosophical and/or experimental movies. Just don&apos;t ask me what the relationship of the story with Dante&apos;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; because I haven&apos;t a clue.",

The music is delicious and addictive, the colours bright and wonderfully kitch.\n\nIf you can take propaganda with a pinch of salt and humour, you&apos;ll love that musical for all the great tunes and amazing dance numbers. It stars many performers (I&apos;m guessing about 100 singer/dancers and a choir of about 300), amongst whom are some of the best singers China has ever produced, who then went on having great careers. \n\nAmusingly, by dating from before the Cultural Revolution, it stars many ethnic minorities and traditional dresses (actually, it makes a point of showing off diverse cultural peoples), Uncle Toming them to death by having them sing loving hymns and peans to Mao. 2 years after the release, all of this would be killed by the now official battle against the &quot;4 old&quot; (traditions and customs) which were supposedly a barrier to &quot;real&quot; communism. \n\nSo it&apos;s also a tale about the &quot;good years&quot; of communist China, a time long gone and already disappearing when the movie was released.",

Similar to his &quot;Rush Hour&quot; series with Chris Tucker, Chan sets this one in the American old west and chooses Owen Wilson as his partner.\n\nI like these better than the Rush Hours.  Tucker and Owen are both excellent playing opposite Chan in both series, but the Shanghai series seems to offer Jackie better venues for his elaborate fight sequences.  Saloons, brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the fight sequences are what make (or break) a Jackie Chan movie.  &quot;Fight sequence&quot; of course means something different in a Chan movie as opposed to normal action fare.  Rather than true violence, Jackie&apos;s fight scenes are more Vaudeville than &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  More Chaplin than Jet Li.  Each fight is painstakingly choreographed to interact with the set surrounding it.  Tables, chairs, vases, antlers, shrubbery... the list goes on.  \n\nA successful Jackie Chan movie seems to contain a comedy-oriented story, a lightly delivered moral message, and lots of action.  Shanghai Noon certainly delivers here.\n\nI spent the entire movie either chuckling to myself or laughing out loud, and had a very satisfied smile when the credits rolled.  Highly recommended.\n\n7 out of 10.",

All the more of a surprise, then, to come across this early Kitano in a totally different style. The storyline is minimal. A young deaf-mute garbage collector finds a broken surfboard, repairs it and becomes obsessed with surfing. His devoted girlfriend follows him - literally - everywhere, six paces behind him, dutifully folding up his discarded clothes while he is surfing.\n\n Surely you can&apos;t make a film with so little action and no dialogue from the main characters! Kitano does, triumphantly. This is a heart-warming film, without being cloying. The relationship between the two central characters is drawn beautifully, using only their eyes and occasional smiles. They hardly ever even touch. But by the end of the film you feel that you know them and your heart goes out to them, in a film with touches of the great Japanese master Ozu. The music complements the film&apos;s moods superbly, and augments the atmospheric stillness that pervades this Japanese masterpiece. A must-see movie.",

Now don&apos;t get me wrong, this isn&apos;t the greatest film ever made, and in many ways it fails to hold a candle to the likes of independence day, which in my opinion is one of the greatest films of its type ever made. It does however, bring a much more up close and personal aspect to an alien invasion. Its more like watching a war filmed in Iraq or something, but that in itself is what separates it from a muddle of recent alien invasion movies that fails to ignite any kind of fire in the mind.\n\nThe film moves at an unrelenting pace, with good action sequences and cgi to boot, its predictable at times and the ending fails to come up with something clever or original, but hey ... you cant have everything !!!",

      "reviewBody": "What can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras, and whether that was by conceit or budget constraints doesn&apos;t make the watching of this variation on a theme by Romero any easier. I was constantly reminded that I was watching somebody&apos;s school project, at best derivative, at worst cheap.\n\nWriter/director Georg Koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with stock footage, but that says more about his editing style than his directing style, which consists of in-your-face close-ups with TV cameras which made me think I was watching public-access television instead of an actual, honest-to-goodness film.\n\nThe story copies and pastes bits and pieces from various sources, including the aforementioned Romero&apos;s DEAD trilogy, THE ROAD WARRIOR (dig that stock footage of a &quot;future&quot; that looks like the past) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.\n\nWhat results is an hour-and-nothing&apos;s worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans. (Okay, the &quot;humans&quot; in this case are clones, but that doesn&apos;t change anything. It&apos;s the same menu.)\n\nThe year is 2031, and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years before have started to malfunction, particularly in the dietary area. Of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It&apos;s not safe to be indoors, it&apos;s not safe to be outdoors. It&apos;s just a matter of time before the flesh-eating ghouls devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? \n\nI don&apos;t mind people ripping off Romero, if it&apos;s done well, but no new territory is covered in this film. It&apos;s NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, shot with television cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the DVD cover makes it look like it was shot, at the very least, with 8mm film. This wouldn&apos;t have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap. The film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. Must we continue to clone our favourite movies?",

Although the acting is somewhat dated, and although there is not a really appropriate musical score that has survived, it has the carefully crafted plot and suspense that Hitchcock would become famous for.\n\nThe opening sequence uses the director&apos;s creative touches in setting the mood of a city terrorized by a mysterious killer, &quot;The Avenger&quot;, who is targeting light-haired women.  Then we meet the actual characters: an older couple and their daughter Daisy, and Daisy&apos;s policeman boyfriend.  When a mysterious lodger appears and rents the family&apos;s extra room, his strange behavior begins to make them suspect that he might be the mad killer, even as he builds a close friendship with Daisy.  As the story proceeds, tension and fear continue to build until an ending that is exciting, if somewhat melodramatic.\n\nHitchcock shows his mastery of silent film technique in using a wide variety of camera techniques and props to communicate the emotions of the characters.  The acting is mostly good, although Ivor Novello as &quot;the lodger&quot; overplays his role rather noticeably.  This is the kind of movie that could really benefit from a good musical soundtrack, and the fact that it is exciting to watch even without an appropriate score shows the quality of Hitchcock&apos;s craftsmanship.\n\nAnyone who enjoys Hitchcock or silent films will definitely want to see &quot;The Lodger&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "Madame Bovary is directed by Vincente Minnelli and adapted to screenplay by Robert Ardrey from the Gustave Flaubert novel. It stars Jennifer Jones, Van Heflin, Louis Jourdan, Alf Kjellin, Gene Lockhart and James Mason. Music is by Miklós Rózsa and cinematography by Robert H. Planck.\n\nIt&apos;s most interesting now watching Minnelli&apos;s picture and being able to place it in the time it was made. Also of major interest is reading up on what the critics of the time had to say about it. This version is an undoubted lesson in the technical crafts of film making, the visuals, the sound, art design, costuming and a literary pumped screenplay that allows the cast to play it classical. It&apos;s also black hearted, perfectly in keeping with the gathering storm of the era that was film noir.\n\nHere is the monster.\n\nSome of the complaints about the film, to me anyway, just don&apos;t add up. Why do we need to care about anyone in this story? It&apos;s a dark tale of illicit passions, greed, betrayals, bad parenting and etc. Is this frowned upon in some circles because of love for the classic novel? Or because there&apos;s some esteem held for other versions? The criticism of Jones is also very suspect given it&apos;s a classic femme fatale performance, Emma is cold and driven and shallow to others feelings, Jones works it perfectly.\n\nAs Rózsa&apos;s beautiful lush and poignant musical arrangements drift and hover over the various story instalments, Minnelli brings the film making guile. His camera work is sublime, like a ghost moving about the characters for the more vibrant scenes, tracking and roving, dizzyingly beautiful. At others it&apos;s close and personal, imbuing Emma&apos;s claustrophobia, with the black and white contrasts superbly photographed by Planck.\n\nSo it doesn&apos;t capture the essence of Flaubert&apos;s intent, then? Emma Bovary a figure of hate instead of sympathy, the lack of a caustic aside on a society of double standards? So what! Outstanding film making is just that, especially when it can tune into a style of film making prevalent at its birth. Madame Bovary - maybe the most film noir movie not actually considered a film noir. Brilliant. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is the work of Ryan Nicholson, an accomplished makeup effects artist and the special effects makeup in Family are really quite good. Nicholson&apos;s work may remind some viewers of Tom Savini&apos;s work in the 1980s. While the cast is inexperienced most of them handled their lines just fine and most of the girls are absolutely gorgeous. \n\nPeople who sit down to Famine with the expectation of a horror film may be put off because it&apos;s more of a comedy with elements of horror. Famine won&apos;t give you nightmares - it doesn&apos;t assault the senses the way Evil Dead does but it also isn&apos;t as successful at melding comedy &amp; horror as Army of Darkness was. \n\nFamine may suffer the most from the writing; the story (not the script) leaves a lot to be desired and the editing took the wind out of the sails for the suspense in one scene after the next so the climax is more like a mercy killing of this interesting feature. \n\nI hope Ryan Nicholson will take a wider view of the talented people in the world and avoid trying to do everything himself next time. With a better story, I think Famine may prove to be a starting point of some great films to come from this talented man.",

Second and third were ok, but when I arrived to the fourth I thought that I was watching a different movie than most of the other reviewers (and I still haven&apos;t seen the fifth).\n\nIn the beginning Dr. Phil and Shaquille O&apos;Neal (as themselves) are in a basement just like Leigh Wannell and Cary Elwes in the ending of the first SAW. After they try to break free Phil notices he cut the wrong foot and then the movie unfolds with a lightning fast parody of films released in those years such as WAR OF THE WORLDS (with Craig Bierko and Michael Madsen in the roles that were of Tom Cruise and Tim Robbins), THE VILLAGE (with Bill Pullman and Carmen Electra in the roles that were of William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard), MILLION DOLLAR BABY, SCOOBY DOO 2 and some others.\n\nI liked this installment more despite its paltry 5,1 on IMDB at the moment because some of the moments made me genuinely laugh. Not that there weren&apos;t some bad jokes, but the funny moments outweighted the lousy ones, and I never felt bored while watching it.\n\nIn substance, if you don&apos;t take this movie too seriously, you&apos;ll surely enjoy it like I did... and the fact that I am not a huge fan of spoof movies yet I liked it says a lot.",

One might say this film breaks the taboo on Nazi humor as &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; did for concentration camp comedy. Very enjoyable.",

      "reviewBody": "I liked the first half of this movie but it left me cold at the end.  There were far too many questions left unanswered.  And it wasn&apos;t as if the writer had any answers, he obviously did not.  This movie was a disappointment. It was all show with no subtance.  I expect more.\n\nThere are movies that leave you wondering what happens next, after the movie ends.  This is not one of those kind of movies.  Have you ever left a movie and wondered what happened to the characters later?  The next day you are still trying to play it out in your imagination, did they turn right or left?  Did they live happily ever after?  Or not.  &quot;Who cares anyway?&quot; is the feeling I have about this movie.  I watched the first half of the movie on the 4th of July.  The fireworks interrupted my viewing.  On the 5th of July, I was filled with antisipation.  So many senerios, so many deeper meanings.  What happened?\n\nThe ending was disappointing.  It left me feeling cheated (but not in a good way).  Some movies fool you into believing one truth but showing the truth to be the Big Lie.  Deep.  True.  This movie turned out to be a stupid lie. Not deep.  Not true.  Just a lie.\n\nLoose threads?  What is mysterious about loose threads that have fogotten how to sew?  You might ask &quot;How can a thread forget how to sew?  For that matter, how can a thread even &quot;know&quot; how to forget anything?  A &quot;thread&quot; doesn&apos;t even have a brain!&quot;  But I&apos;m sure this clever directer thought he could imagine a way to fool naive audiences into beleiving that even a snowball has a chance in hell. No, it doesn&apos;t.\n\nIf that doesn&apos;t make sence to you, get used to it.  Niether does this movie. All threads are left loose, without rhyme or reason.  This is not a movie to contemplate the various endings that might have taken place.  There are no &quot;might&apos;ve, could&apos;ve, would&apos;ve or should&apos;ve&quot;  moments in this movie because, quite frankly, you know by the end of the movie that random bits of &quot;seemingly meaningless&quot; information were not so &quot;seemingly&quot; after all.  In fact, they were only &quot;meaningless&quot;.\n\nI know it&apos;s hip to be confusing, but the real world is random enough for me. Give me something to care about in a movie.  Let me care enough about a character to daydream the next day about what &quot;might have been&quot; or about what is still yet to come.  But don&apos;t tell me not to want to care.\n\n Have a point.  Make a point.  Think about it.  Don&apos;t &quot;just do it&quot;.\n\n This movie appears to be a deep movie .  But it doesn&apos;t even make sense. There is something beyond twisted in the main character&apos;s obsession with a stripper (who used to babysit for the his child).  Oh, by the way, she happens to be wearing the same uniform of the murdered little girl.  And the father is obsessed with his ex-babysitter.  Somehow, it soothes him to go to the seedy strip joint and &quot;test&quot; the little tart.  This is so insulting to any real murdered-child&apos;s father.  As I watched this movie, I hoped my cousin, who&apos;s daughter really was murdered, doesn&apos;t accidentally see this movie.  The notion of a grieving father watching a re-inactment of an &quot;innocent little girl&quot; played by his own daughter&apos;s ex-babysitter is nauseating.  The fact that we weren&apos;t even given a reason for the depravity is even more disenchanting and far-fetched.  Oh yeah.  She wasn&apos;t praised as a child and he wants to fill that need.  They need to need each other in a sick way.  We are supposed to care about these weirdos? I think not.  How arrogant."

But it&apos;s blessed with many cool scenes of violence, strange dialog and good old sleazzzzz. There&apos;s more than one moment of unnecessary nudity here. Don&apos;t take it to seriously though cause it&apos;s just a fun ride, and nothing more. The white horse Burt Collins rides is said to be the same horse that gets loaded in Cat Ballou. The actor Fred Robsahm is actually from Norway and he&apos;s currently residing in a small town called Lillesand. He does a lot of the stunt work in this movie (not just he&apos;s own). Kinski is cool as the weird lawyer that has a strange habit of transforming he&apos;s law books into deadly weapons. Great soundtrack and some nice cinematography gives the film good atmosphere and it&apos;s well worth the watch. Available on DVD from xploitedcinema",

      "reviewBody": "I recently viewed See No Evil (1971) on Tubi. The plot centers around a blind woman returning home after a long absence, only to unknowingly find herself in a house where everyone has met a grim fate. When the perpetrator realizes she&apos;s in the house, her life might be in grave danger.\n\nDirected by Richard Fleischer (Red Sonya), the film stars Mia Farrow (Rosemary&apos;s Baby), Dorothy Alison (The Third Key), Norman Eshley (Warship), Robin Bailey (The Diplomatic Corpseg and Paul Nicholas (Tommy).\n\nThis movie had great potential, featuring a unique premise, well-established circumstances, and an excellent performance by Farrow. Regrettably, it fell short in delivering the horror elements I anticipated, relying heavily on Farrow&apos;s acting to portray the blind woman rather than creating a genuinely eerie atmosphere. Notably, the use of cowboy boots added a playful touch, and the depiction of the corpses was commendable. The bathtub scene in the finale was a standout moment in the film.\n\nIn summary, See No Evil is worth a watch for horror enthusiasts, but it missed an opportunity to truly distinguish itself in the genre. I would rate this a 5.5-6/10 and recommend considering Audrey Hepburn&apos;s Wait Until Dark as a more captivating alternative.",

      "reviewBody": "This Disney oldie was directed by Don Chaffey, the same who directed &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; and &quot;Pete&apos;s Dragon&quot; and, like the famous story of Hachiko, is based in a true story, in this case of a Skye Terrier named Greyfriars Bobby that lived in the 19th century (in Edinburgh, Scotland) and became famous for reportedly spending 14 years guarding the grave of his owner until his own death.\n\nIn the film (I&apos;m not sure how it was in real life) Greyfrairs Bobby, despite guarding his owner&apos;s grave, doesn&apos;t spend the whole time there waiting for him to come back. People feed him well and he gets along beautifully with most everyone, especially children.\n\nThe film was shot in England and Scotland. Its looks very dated but rich cinematography is one of its virtues, thanks to the enchantment and natural beauty of the Scottish scenario.\n\nI noticed that they often use the expressions &quot;laddie&quot; and &quot;lassie&quot;, which are often used by Jock the Scottish Terrier in &apos;Lady and the Tramp&apos;.\n\nConsidering their roles, most actors are alright. But the star is definitely the little great star. Now, who can that be? That&apos;s the doggy, of course!\n\nThe dog is cute and utterly adorable. His loyalty to his owner in life and even long after death is worthy to be considered and admired. Despite being a dramatic film it has some fun moments. The children of the film are all nice and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, a reasonable film, realistic, poignant. Its only let-down is the courtroom scenes and the rather annoying policeman who looked like a caricature of himself.",

      "reviewBody": "As a New Yorker who happens to be steeped in the lore of New York in the prohibition era, this film represents a bold attempt to capture the dynamics of the period. At times it succeeds. At other times it falls way short of the mark.\n\nWhat I really admire is the fact that it deals with racial and ethnic friction honestly. The racial slurs in the dialog were part of the reality of that time. Relations between blacks and whites are not idealized. Richard Gere and Gregory Hines are neighbors and acquaintances, but are not portrayed as close friends. When Gregory Hines prevents Dutch Schultz (James Remar in a vivid characterization) from killing Richard Gere, he does it out of basic decency. Mercifully, there are none of the sentimental relationships between blacks and whites that seem so patently false in other films.\n\nGangland New York during the prohibition era has rarely been portrayed accurately. A worst case example was a 1991 disaster called Mobsters (a.k.a. &quot;Young Tommy Guns&quot;). The Cotton Club deals with real life chracters like Owney Madden (has he ever been portrayed in another film under his real name?), Big Frenchy DeMange, Arthur &quot;Dutch Schultz&quot; Flegenheimer, a Vincent Coll standin, Charlie &quot;&quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, &quot;Trigger&quot; Mike Coppola, and (at least in an early shooting script) Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond. Richard Gere&apos;s character was loosely based on George Raft.\n\nThey were fascinating characters. At times, The Cotton Club tries to play fair with them. It almost succeeds.\n\nOn the whole, this should have been a better film. Personally, I would have preferred a film that focused on the real life gangsters with the music simply as background. The attempt to elevate the black characters to a position of equal importance in the narrative is the flaw that undoes the film. It&apos;s difficult to follow characters who have no power and little chance of gaining it. Obviously, that is not politically correct. However, I prefer for historical films to deal with life the way it really was, rather than the way some people think that it should have been.\n\nAll in all, an interesting and honorable failure."

Now there is quite a lot of comedy in it and there is also quite a lot of violence in it too.\n\nIt is what he knows to do - and he is good in it. And while I did not look into if there is any autobiographical aspect to it, it does feel like he at least is chanelling something about himself. It may feel like small pieces sown together, but there is craft in that, making it compelling and interesting to see the road and determination of an artist. It is odd, but it is also really good",

The movie itself was a fascinating discussion about the nature of corporate PR and the possible taking advantage of a tightly controlled publicity campaign. They made it seem like everything was out in the open, but if you look a layer below, the signs of opaqueness are, at the least, concerning. Engineers being allowed to tinker in between games, putting the computer in a locked room, refusing to display code or log files, immediately abandoning a rematch and destroying the computer. The IBM engineer in the movie even seemed to be gaslighting and turning the screw deeper on film. He relished in the controversy and mind games. If that is the man behind deep blue, I would be very concerned. He seemed like a sociopath. But that&apos;s just my two cents. If they played it fair, they certainly didn&apos;t behave like they did after the fact. Let alone the suspicious mistakes mixed with brilliant moves in game 1 and 2. The movie is fascinating and less biased than people give credit for. The turk B Roll is a bit gratuitous, but overall, IBM got to march out their weak excuses for hiding and controlling everything. The upside for them was way too high to not make all the circumstantial evidence baseless. Its a must see if you are a chess fan.",

Jim Broadbent delight us, once more, with his overgrown child of a father that seems a figment of her son&apos;s imagination. His childishness seems to be his only flaw. I couldn&apos;t help but being reminded of Tim Burton&apos;s &quot;Big Fish&quot; this time, with radically different flights of fancy. Colin Firth plays the writer/son as a crashing bore. Was that on purpose? I&apos;ve been longing to see Firth again in parts like the ones he so amazingly captured - &quot;Apartment Zero&quot; comes to mind. Here earnest or not earnest, loving, selfish and so forth I didn&apos;t quite get myself interested enough to care as much as I feel I should have. Matthew Beard, the younger Blake and Juliet Stevens as the mother, manage to create more intriguing characters. The film, however, belongs to Jim Broadbent - His character is a loving mix of assorted British loving eccentrics. The fact that this is the way her son Blakes remembers him, makes the experience worth while.",

      "reviewBody": "Tremors 5: Bloodlines (English) 6.5/10 Genre: Adventure/Action Director: Don Michael Paul Cast: Michael Gross, Jamie Kennedy, Natalie Becker Year: 2015\n\nThis movie certainly is a victim of bad marketing and promotion and will undoubtedly be one of the most underrated films of 2015 and honestly I never knew that there will be a fifth coming out from the Tremors franchise. This also happens to be the second film this year after Jurassic World which took me back to my childhood when I used to love these monster movies but surprisingly I felt this was better than Jurassic World considering the fact that it was probably made on one tenth of Jurassic World&apos;s budget, no theatrical release and above all I had no expectation from this film and watched it just for fun, turns out it&apos;s more than just fun. The special effects and creature effects were as good as any high budget film and since this one is just a direct-to-DVD B-grade film it somehow was the best as compared to other films made on low budget. The story this time moves to South Africa where Burt Gummer is back hunting down Graboids with the help of his unknown Son. Don Michael Paul who has directed quite a few B-grade films probably did his best job as director in regards to B-grade films. Acting was not bad if not brilliant which is pretty understandable for a film like this with Michael Gross reprising his role as Gummer for the fifth time and the only actor to appear in all the Tremors films along with Jamie Kennedy performing supporting duties as his son. The action, stunt and creature effects were pretty cool and the reason why I loved it so much. If you are fan of the Tremors franchise then you cannot afford to miss this one which might surprise you as well.",

      "reviewBody": "An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical. Made at the height of MGM&apos;s powers as a musical powerhouse, the film features memorable music from the Gershwins, who rightly have been called the 20th Century&apos;s equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. \n\nGene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin&apos; in the Rain (1952). The two films are actually closely linked. Aside from the Arthur Freed connection, the Broadway Melody segment in &quot;Rain&quot; owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film. This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film. And it deserved to be, as it showcases Gene Kelly&apos;s skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.\n\nThe film&apos;s cast is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, incredibly making her film debut, shows a maturity that makes you think she&apos;d been making films for years. Her introductory dance sequence, and later her work on the Ballet, provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse&apos;s work in Singin&apos; in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly&apos;s stoic pal, who gets two of the film&apos;s best moments: during the end party sequence (which I will not give away for anyone who hasn&apos;t seen the film), and one of the film&apos;s most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects.\n\nLess memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly&apos;s romantic rival, though he does get a few musical highlights, and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron&apos;s romantic rival. The May-December relationship between Kelly&apos;s character and Nina&apos;s reminded me of the same &quot;kept man&quot; relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s.\n\nThere are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin&apos; in the Rain. The Ballet, though lavish and well-produced, doesn&apos;t really fit with the rest of the movie. Without giving away the plot, the Ballet just happens, with no real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it really doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals, the songs always have some sort of raison d&apos;etre. \n\nMaking matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet. Although the ending shouldn&apos;t be a surprise (this IS an MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the Ballet ended. It&apos;s as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn&apos;t follow the Ballet with anything else. The film literally left me in the lurch.\n\nThat negative aside, An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood&apos;s musicals. It doesn&apos;t quite reach the heights of Singin&apos; in the Rain, but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly&apos;s skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.",

It had all the necessary features of a good movie: the cast was superb, the plot was superb, and in the case of thrillers, there was genuine &quot;thrills&quot; throughout.\n\nKeifer Sutherland offered a marvelous performance as the male lead in the piece, portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life, essentially &quot;stealing&quot; death&apos;s secrets away. Kevin Bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and, apparently, intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent.\n\nThe story is relatively simple, yet original, and the acting is refreshing-- definitely a stand out film for the genre, and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me.\n\n8/10.",

Garland is in fine form, especially with the Embraceable You number, which is also very well staged and choreographed. I like the western setting, unusual for an A-musical, but it works. However, the curtain-closing I Got Rhythm appears over-done, especially the six-gun fusillade. Then too, those marching phalanxes of cowboys and girls are unmistakably Busby Berkeley at work. The plot&apos;s a typical Let&apos;s Put on a Show, only this time it&apos;s to rescue a college&apos;s floundering enrollment. The show&apos;s also a good excuse to parade around a lot of statuesque beauties, but who&apos;s complaining. Too bad, this was the dynamic duo&apos;s last pairing— together they certainly light up the screen."

What a magnificent work - visually it is as powerful as the painting Nolte&apos;s Lionel was painting. Combining in one short film Procul Harum&apos;s &quot;A whiter shade of pale&quot; and Puccini&apos;s &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; from &quot;Turandot&quot; was a stroke of genius. This film is an ode to the power of talent; it is about greatness and curse of the gift, not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I&apos;d say one of the best ever made about the Artist&apos;s work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece - his love, desire, lust, cries, whispers, tears, and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal, triumphant, brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished, he would need a new source of inspiration and self-torture, and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.5/10 \n\nI loved Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot; and I think it is very funny and touching. Looks like Allen has met mothers or grandmothers like Mrs. Millstein in real life and his little gem is his love-hate letter to them. In the end, mom always knows what is best for her little boy. Mae Questel and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) were wonderful. Woody&apos;s face after his mom &quot;disappears&quot; and the scene when he practically makes love to the chicken drumstick are pure delight; also the commentary that New York is used to everything and readily accepts the crazy situation - it is so true. One of the best Allen&apos;s films I&apos;ve seen lately - I am very glad that I finally saw it.\n\nLarry David (&quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;) plays the Theater Manager. It made me think if Estelle Costanza created by David and Mrs. Millstein (Woody&apos;s omnipresent mother) have a lot in common in making the lives of their sons miserable and smothering them with their merciless love? 9/10 \n\nCoppola&apos;s &quot;Life Without Zoë&quot; was much weaker than Scorsese&apos;s and Allan&apos;s stories and paled in comparison - this episode &quot;from the lives of the reach and beautiful&quot; was pretty and cute but you can skip it. 5/10"

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s interesting this is mostly a British-funded film (although it&apos;s hard to pin down nationality of anything as amorphous as movies, anymore). Some time ago, the Mumia case began to droop in the United States - unable to generate passion among even the most blinkered true Lefty believers. In 1981, Mumia was found sitting on a Philadelphia sidewalk, badly wounded by bullets from a policeman&apos;s gun, with his own fired gun beside him; a few feet away was the dead policeman, full of bullets from Mumia&apos;s said gun. That&apos;s pretty much the case. Since then, we&apos;ve been told up is down, night is day, and Mumia is innocent.\n\nThis movie avoids like the plague those actual, damning details of the case, and launches into a long, blobby, tiresome recounting of racism in America. We get input from such notable historians as Snoop Dog. Europeans must go ga-ga over this stuff; on this side of the pond, we can recite it by rote. There&apos;s a limit to even the most well-mapped guilt trips - not that this is on that list, and it&apos;s a wonder movies like this get funded these days. It probably had an audience in the... 5s."

      "reviewBody": "You often hear people lament:&quot;they don&apos;t make them like they used to&quot;. This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant, old-fashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II, Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an ex-GI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and Sanchez-Gijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family, love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by Sanchez-Gijon&apos;s family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, Sanchez-Gijon&apos;s grandfather. He steals every scene he&apos;s in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts, settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it&apos;s pure heart and the exquisite joy of it&apos;s touching romance."

      "reviewBody": "If you expect to learn something new about Joschka Fischer, you should not watch this film. In this documentary he hardly talks about private stuff but rather about post-war events and - a bit - about their impact on him.\n\nThe entire documentary shows Joschka Fischer in a video installation where he sees scenes of his own live and it streams the scenes themselves. We learn that he grew up in an environment where people voted for the Christian Democratic Union and that he was an altar boy. The film moves on to his early political live, eg the killing of Benno Ohnesorg by the police, the terror by the Red Army Faction and how he finally became minister.\n\nHere the film does get a little personal: Fischer describes why he had to wear sneakers and a naff jacket even though he did not like them and how awful it was for him to head a huge administration where he has to learn who is responsible for what.\n\nLater on, when he was Foreign Minister, he was responsible for sending German soldiers to former Yugoslavia - without a UN mandate. He tries to explain why he did so but seems rather wishy-washy. After all, he is a &quot;realo&quot;, while the fundamentalist Greens nowadays have left Germany&apos;s parliament(s).\n\nIf you want to learn more about him, his motives etc, you should probably read &quot;Mein langer Lauf zu mir selbst&quot; - which I haven&apos;t - but if you want to know more about Germany&apos;s history after the Second World War, you will get concise information in just 140 minutes. As I am not that much interested in some politician&apos;s private live, I liked this film.",

Instead they seem like a typical suburban couple of the early sixties except for one problem, Rock is an obsessive compulsive hypochondriac. \n\nAnother visit to Edward Andrews the doctor and a big misunderstanding convince Rock he&apos;s a terminal case and he starts making preparations both to meet his Maker and make sure about Doris who he leaves behind. That causes all kinds of funny situations that Rock and Doris muddle through with the fumbling help of a lot of people.\n\nHudson and Day did three films together and by rights they should be listed as a trio with Tony Randall because he was in all three of the films and added so much to them as Hudson&apos;s comic foil. Of course this was in the day much before he became TV&apos;s most famous fuss budget, Felix Unger. Still you can see traces of Felix in all three of Randall&apos;s roles with Rock and Doris.\n\nSend Me No Flowers is the weakest of the three comedies I feel because the Hudson-Day team works so much better with Rock trying to grab a little nookie from Doris and getting hooked for his troubles. Still the film has some really nice moments. All three of their films were well cast with some of the best supporting players around.\n\nMy favorite in Send Me No Flowers is Paul Lynde as the cemetery director who just loves his job. He has two scenes, one with Rock buying a cemetery plot and a second with Doris where he inadvertently solves the problems Rock&apos;s hypochondria works them into.\n\nRock and Doris surely made one wonderful movie screen team.",

      "name": "Rich, complex and massive, yet somewhat misunderstood",
      "reviewBody": "While I am not the biggest fan of the Western genre, I appreciate a great deal of films from the genre. The Searchers is one of them. It is complex, it is rich and it is quite massive. Yet I think it is somewhat misunderstood too. Why do I say that? Well just reading some of the comments on here pretty much says it all. Comments accusing the film of being racist, of the main character being unlikeable, of the film being dated, John Wayne being too old and being slow and confusing.\n\nFirst of all, I don&apos;t think the film is racist at all. I see I am not the first person to write this, but The Searchers is more ABOUT racism if anything. And most of this comes from the protagonist Ethan Edwards, who is completely different to not only to what the audience expects but to any other character John Wayne has ever played. There are several actions that Edwards commits throughout the film that do shock us and something that we don&apos;t expect a main character or any character to do.\n\nBut that is the thing. There have been complaints of Ethan Edwards being unlikeable, unorthodox and such. My impression was that he was MEANT to be. Ethan Edwards above all else is an anti-hero, a rootless pioneer and forever framed in the doorways of family homesteads of which he can never become part. John Wayne admittedly has been in a few clunkers in his career, as has every actor and actress in existence, but he has also done some good ones, such as Fort Apache, The Shootist and of course this film. While he pulled off great performances in those movies, being delicate in Fort Apache and poignant in The Shootist, he plays his grittiest, most complex and richest character I think in The Searchers. And his performance is absolutely brilliant, arguably his best, and no I don&apos;t think he was too old for the role, there have been actors who have pulled off great performances regardless of their age.\n\nI don&apos;t think this film is dated either. The cinematography is beautiful and inventive, and the scenery is well and truly spectacular. Monument Valley especially looks simply magnificent, I have read that like the film it is massive and unmissable, and whoever said that are right I think.\n\nWhether it is slow and confusing is open to interpretation and dependent on whether this is your thing, which I imagine is the case with some people. First with the slow complaint, admittedly it isn&apos;t the fastest moving movie in the world, yet it maintained my attention. I&apos;ll list two or so movies that were more pedestrian than this one- The Green Berets and Torn Curtain, though the latter was decent actually. The plot isn&apos;t confusing for me, it is rich and complex like the characters, but it was interesting with themes of revenge and reconciliation. It may ramble a bit in the middle half I agree, but I accepted that was how it was meant to be.\n\nThat&apos;s not the whole story though. The score is majestic and haunting, giving real weight to the film, and the writing is very strong. John Ford&apos;s direction is masterful, immediately taking grasp of the story, its themes and the characters and merging them into one adeptly. The characters are rich, complex and developed well, while the other acting is very good. Jeffrey Hunter gives a solid performance as Edwards&apos;s conscience, and Vera Miles is pretty good too. As is Natalie Wood, the same Natalie Wood who played an adorable little girl in Miracle on 34th Street and a beautiful woman in West Side Story and Splendour in the Grass, while Ward Bond is intriguing and Hank Worden brings a more light-hearted touch to the proceedings. And the ending? Brilliant!\n\nOverall, a brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The story was on the CBS evening news and a couple of the news magazine shows several years ago. Every now and then you either see, or read something about him.\n\nI watch movies to be entertained. If I wanted &quot;deep thought&quot; I&apos;d go to a library. This is Jack Black being Jack Black. The dialog is crude, humor slapstick, and storyline so, so. But it&apos;s funny.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t buy it for my personal collection, but it&apos;s good for an evening of rental movies at home.",

Shatrughan is unforgettable as the Bad good guy, Shashi Kapoor at his debonair best, Prem Chopra the consummate villain - and best of all unlike other Bollywood glamorized movies this one is shot thru with an extremely strong dose of realism - you can almost taste the coal dust and grit in your mouth - one of Yash Chopra&apos;s very best and India&apos;s nod to the Hollywood disaster hits of the 70s - but then of course the crown jewel is Amitabh all the way - a towering electrifying performance. Soundtrack is awesome too (Ek Raasta Hai Zindagi by Kishore especially) - Quality of the movie on Amazon is great - crisp and original quality with no digital artifacts - pitch perfect digital version",

They are annoying and quite disgusting at times. This movie was not laugh out loud funny, but was amusing at times. I really liked the airplane banner at the end. That was funny. In the beginning they buy women groceries in hopes of getting phone numbers. But no such luck. One of the brothers ask a woman to marry him on the first date. They just don&apos;t get the dating game. But of course think they are cool. There were many more silly things throughout the film.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: This is for people who like all those silly Jim Carrey films. So check it out, if you fall in that category.",

If you are willing to put the stereotypical - boring - humour aside and open up for this entertaining, witty, insightful and brilliantly funny story - then this is the film for you.\n\nShot in only 21 days this is a masterpiece and definitely one of the funniest film&apos;s i have ever seen. Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau make a brilliant team and the onscreen chemistry between them makes the film seem ever more realistic.\n\nSome of the jokes are worth repeating and talking about after watching this film - if you haven&apos;t seen it yet then go and get it and watch out for the french teacher, peaches and the little singer man.\n\nIf you have seen this film and still can&apos;t appreciate the brilliantness then maybe you&apos;d have to wonder whether your humour is too spoiled by the overdrawn high budget hollywood stuff. But that&apos;s only my opinion."

Breathtaking special effects, an excitingly melodramatic plot, stunning settings, and gorgeous cinematography combine to make this one of the first great feature films.\n\nThe cinematography is very different to what we are used to today - the camera does not move at all - but the shots are so well lit that it hardly seems to matter.  And the genuine beauty of the final shot makes the scene very moving indeed.\n\nThis is an unmissable masterpiece of cinema.",

Of course, his couple with Liv Ullmann is laughable, James Mason looks bored to death (he should be), Jill Ireland is pathetic as a hippie drug dealer (she did it again in &quot;Assassination&quot; years later). But as far as Bronson&apos;s mythology is concerned (in Europe, at least), &quot;Cold sweat&quot; meant something at the time. The first time he was publicized as a superstar. For fans only..."

      "reviewBody": "Pay no attention to the sensational marketing on the back of the DVD declaring this to be a &quot;kooky&quot; &quot;romantic comedy&quot; &quot;funnier than Police Academy 17!&quot; (well OK, I made up that last one) I was expecting some big belly laughs, and after the first half hour without even cracking a smile, I started to feel disappointed. But that&apos;s when I realized that this is not really a comedy and it shouldn&apos;t be approached as such. True, there are some bizarre characters and weird situations like a guy getting accused of infidelity because he happens to be zipping up his fly at an inopportune moment (after taking a pee), but comedy is not the heart of this film; poetry is. The vibe the director achieved here reminds me of Bertolucci&apos;s &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;, Stillman&apos;s &quot;Barcelona&quot; or maybe the more recent &quot;L&apos;auberge espagnole&quot; but with older characters. It&apos;s a very European story--and by that I mean the characters are extremely diverse and cosmopolitan, and the scenery plays a key role--about a bunch of people just being normal, or as normal as they can be under the circumstances.\n\nThere aren&apos;t a lot of wild plot twists, no real action, and no melodramatic romances like you might expect from Hollywood. As best as I can describe it, this is a movie about real life set in an unreal setting (a dreamy island off the coast of Spain).\n\nThe story is about a dead composer and how his legacy impacts the people who adored him. Here is where, I believe, we get the title of the film &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;. In real life, composer Richard Strauss wrote 4 songs (Spring, September, Sleep, Sunset) in his last year before he died, and these songs prophetically consider the subject of death, yet not with dread &amp; fear but with calm &amp; serenity. The movie has nothing about Strauss but instead invents a fictional composer whose works are to be performed in a tribute concert. The &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; in the movie could relate to the 4 subplots: a young woman discovering her life (Spring), a mature couple dealing with their insecurities (September), a man who seems to be courting death (Sleep) and an unfinished romance left in the wake of the composer&apos;s passing (Sunset). The music seems to unify these 4 subplots into a cohesive tale, and that&apos;s how we get &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;.\n\nThis is of course, just my personal interpretation. But the point that I&apos;m trying to make is that this is a film that can be approached at different levels, and its poetic nature lends itself to many possible meanings. In that sense, it ain&apos;t no hilarious romantic comedy. If, right from the get-go, you realize that it&apos;s a very symbolic &amp; artistic story I think you&apos;ll enjoy it so much more.",

Hundra hates men - all men BUT the wise sage woman tells Hundra to find of the wolf clan men and to have a baby in order to keep there kind going, since they are the last of their kind. Then our movie really begins... Hundra goes out to hunt for a man of the wolf clan to have a baby with.\n\nThe movie is alright - not too bad. The acting is lacking a bit but it&apos;s not so awful that the characters are flat.. everyone in the film was doing their best I believe. It&apos;s a sincere film with a handful of comical scenes (like the belching &amp; farting man).\n\nThis is a pretty decent sword and sorcery type of movie if you like the Conan types of films - except this one is focused on a female barbarian.\n\n5/10",

A family of con-artists on the Riviera, about to bilk a former Senator out of some three million dollars, are asked to leave the country by the authorities; they&apos;re penniless, but luckily they meet a kindly old lady on the train to London and are asked to stay as guests at her mansion. The screenplay curdles with cuteness now and then (and certainly that unmemorable title hasn&apos;t enhanced the film&apos;s reputation), yet an enjoyable time is had by all. The first-rate cast (headed by Janet Gaynor as the &quot;rotter&quot; daughter) works the material fabulously, and there&apos;s a sweetheart of an automobile (the Flying Wombat). Also, a butler who adores Dominoes, a suspicious lawyer, a sharp working girl (Paulette Goddard, naturally stunning), and some satiric laughs while gently poking fun at the working class. *** from ****",

And here we see two young men, with dreams of life at sea. Is realizing one&apos;s lifelong dream worth crushing the dreams of another? It is this dilemma that paves the way for a story that truly explores the inner strengths and weaknesses within us all. It will be hard not be moved by this film, which lives up to the quality of previous films focusing on life behind the Berlin Wall. Great performances by all main characters.",

She finds a job in a bakery; she orders the manufacturing of a special weapon; she reunites with her daughter, who was adopted by an Australian family; and she plots revenge against the real killer of Won-mo, the English teacher Mr. Baek (Min-sik Choi). With the support of former inmates from prison, Geum-ja seeks an unattained redemption with her vengeance.\n\n&quot;Lady Vengeance&quot; is a very dark tale of vengeance and search for redemption. The screenplay is confused in some moments, using symbols and metaphors, but the story is engaging blending black humor and unpleasant and bold scenes of torture and death of children with a harsh revenge. Yeong-ae Lee has a magnificently performance in the role of Geum-ja along almost fourteen years of her life. I am a big fan of Chan-wook Park, and I regret that in Brazil the first movie of his trilogy about vengeance (&quot;Boksuneun Naui Geot&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot;) has not been released yet. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Lady Vingança&quot; (&quot;Lady Vengeance&quot;)",

      "name": "A bright as well as lively swashbuckler with effective and brilliant Technicolor photography",
      "reviewBody": "An enjoyable swashbuckler about a ship captain who has another identity , disguising as a pirate during the first half of the 19th century. One of those colourful thrilling 90 minute adventure tales which Universal-International Pictures rolled out with such expertise and regularity in the Fifties . Agreeable Pirate movie dealing with Captain David Porter (Jeff Chandler) of the fledgling American Navy on the seas , versus powerful Count Domingo Del Prado (Joseph Callleia) , as well as other nasty pirates and finding romance with a beautiful girl (Suzan Ball) along the way . It deals with an United States Navy ship , under the command of Captain David Porter (Jeff Chandler) , is expecting to put ashore after a year overseas ; but the arrival of one of Porter&apos;s ex-students, now as a second-in-command : David Farragut (Scott Brady) , brings a dangerous assignment : to pose the ship and crew as a pirate ship and help the Navy locate the thieves who have been robbing America&apos;s merchant fleet. Meanwhile, they stumble upon an international conspiracy formed by various countries : Spain , Portugal , Brazil . Universal-International&apos;s Fiery Swashbuckling Adventure! .Stand-by to Board! Terror Cry of the Spanish Main!\n\nConventional and standard sea adventure movie from Universal International Studios . Amusing pirate movie , plenty of action-packed , land rescues , thrills , sea battles , colorful cinematography , luxurious costumes and paced in lighthearted style . It is a blending of adventures , romance , action , exciting naval battle scenes , and swashbuckler . Although the story has been told before , tight filmmaking and nice acting win out . The flick takes parts of the plot developed in ¨Against all flags¨ by George Sherman and ¨Rifle springfield¨ by André De Toth . The picture moves along in stirring as well as agressive style , it is fast-moving , exciting and thrilling right up to the final climatic confrontation . Average-budgeted film by Universal Pictures , using appropriate ship shots and miniature sets when possible . Universal took advantage of the unused sets in ¨Against all flags¨ by George Sherman with Errorl Flynn , Anthony Quinn by scripting and shooting a hastily assembled B picture . ¨Yankee Buccaneer¨ belongs to Pirate or Swashbuckling sub-genre along with ¨Captain Blood¨, ¨The Sea Hawk¨ , ¨Long John Silver¨, ¨Anne of the Indians¨, ¨Buccaneer&apos;s girl¨, ¨Adventures of Captain Fabian¨ , ¨The Crimson pirate¨ and ¨Against all flags¨ . Stars Jeff Chandler who receives orders to masquerade as a privateer in order to corral some Caribbean pirates .It results to be one of Jeff Chandler&apos;s swashbuckling best though hasn&apos;t achieved the same classic status . Jeff Chandler provides stature to the role , delivering sincerity and bravura . Chandler was known , until his early death , for playing Indian chief Cochise , a dignified portrait well shown in : ¨Broken arrow¨ (50) by Delmer Daves , that was the first time the Red Indian was depicted as a human being rather than a brute savage merely to bite the dust at the hands of the US cavalry , as well as ¨Battle of Apache Pass¨ (1952) and ¨Taza , son of Cochise¨ (1954) by Douglas Sirk , this latter Jeff/Cochise is briefly glimpsed as a dying man at the beginning and handing over the reins of power to Rock Hudson as Taza . Although Chandler also played all kinds of genres , such as : ¨Return to Peyton Place¨(drama) , ¨Flame of Araby¨ (adventure) , ¨Merrill&apos;s marauders¨ (wartime , in his last film, he died while its shooting) , until his early death at 42-year-old . And gorgeous Suzan Ball as hot-tempered Countess Margarita La Raguna , she is given the opportunity to show both spirit and a handsome wardrobe . Suzan signed a contract with Universal and in 1952 she was proclaimed &quot;The New Cinderella Girl of 1952&quot;. She had a fleeting romance with Scott Brady, who she met on the set of Denbow (1952), and they planned to marry. She then filmed City beneath water (1953) and fell for Anthony Quinn, who was still married , finally she married Richard Long . While rehearsing a scene for an episode of Climax! (1954), she collapsed and was rushed to the hospital , doctors found that the cancer had spread to her lungs. In 1955, Suzan died of cancer, only six months after her 21st birthday .There stands out a great support cast made up with familiar faces such as : Scott Brady , almost starring , as a willful and independent Lieutenant whose disobedience threatens the safety of the crew , Joseph Calleia , George Mathews , Rodolfo Acosta , Jay Silverheels , Michael Ansara , Joseph Vitale ,Rodolfo Acosta and you can spot the famous ¨Fugitive¨, a very young David Janssen.\n\nThis is a good-natured Technicolor romp with splendid cinematography from Russell Metty and Richard Metty that make the movie a constant pleasure to look at and being particularly effective in the spectacular naval battle set pieces . And evocative and atmospheric musical score by Joseph E. Gershenson and Milton Rosen , though uncredited . The motion picture was well directed by Frederick De Cordoba , a craftsman and action specialist who had already filmed other adventures .He spent much of his career at Universal Pictures, where he turned out medium-budget westerns, comedies and musicals. In the mid-&apos;50s he turned his main focus to television, directing and producing The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show , The Jack Benny Program and December Bride . He shot decent films as Frankie and Johnny , I&apos;ll take Sweden , Here come the Nelsons , Bedtime for Bonzo , For the love of Mary . Rating : 6/10 , acceptable pirate movie , wonderful stuff . It will appeal to Jeff Chandler fans .",

Well, this isn&apos;t quite the case here.... Louis de Funes does what he does best-the above mentioned- but the film comes as a surprise in which that it is more than a comedy- the end proves it ! It&apos;s a satire at all that makes today&apos;s society&apos;s entertainment : church, family values, onerous business, TV reality shows, politicians, public services like police, fire fighters, first aid; it&apos;s all there in the spotlight and none is given a sweet pat on the head- far from it ! The film being shot in the early 70&apos;s, the satire addressing all the mentioned areas is so much more compelling. The silly accident which leads to three strangers being literally perched on a &apos;pin parapluie&apos; in a car above the sea for a week is still a good starting point for some gentle humour &apos;De Funes style&apos;, but when the protagonists are finally discovered there&apos;s a load of not so humorous, yet immensely funny reactions from all the concerned authorities or people , none of them actually doing much to rescue our heroes. And when they are finally rescued... well... A film to watch at least for one reason: it is not what you might expect.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Rathinirvedam,&quot; the 2011 Malayalam movie adaptation of the novel by Pathmarajan, falls short of expectations, failing to honor the essence of the original work. Despite its commercial intentions, the film&apos;s narrative deviates significantly from the source material, leaving viewers disoriented and disconnected.\n\nOne of the glaring flaws lies in the cinematography, which fails to capture the essence and depth of the story. The visuals lack finesse and fail to immerse the audience in the world of the characters.\n\nWhile the leading actors, Swetha Menon and Sreejith Vijay, deliver commendable performances, the subpar dubbing detracts from their efforts. Additionally, although Swetha Menon portrays her character beautifully, her casting seems mismatched with the age of the character, diminishing the authenticity of the portrayal.\n\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of connection with the characters, a crucial element that the book masterfully establishes. The film fails to evoke the same emotional resonance, leaving viewers longing for the depth and complexity present in the original text.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Rathinirvedam&quot; may have aimed for commercial success, but it ultimately falls short in capturing the essence of the novel it is based on. With its twisted storyline, lackluster cinematography, and inconsistent casting, this adaptation fails to do justice to the rich source material."

Witty repertoire CAN wear thin and become precocious in movies, but in &apos;National Treasure&apos;, it&apos;s the film&apos;s most endearing and appealing factor, carried off successfully by some of the most experienced actors in the business - They keep the film fun and pull off their quips with deft skill - Bravo!\n\nA well casted, directed and edited film that doesn&apos;t pretend to be more than it is, and delivers what audiences came to see.\n\nEnjoy this snappy-paced treasure hunt Disney ride without guilt - it&apos;s OK to have escapism fun watching movies, and this one does it as well as any, so grab a bowl of popcorn and indulge yourself.\n\n👍👍",

The aircraft that crashes is just as sexy.  A romp around Europe rounds this great film out.  Watch with your wife or girlfriend with wine - not with the guys and beer!"

      "reviewBody": "Within the last week, Fox FINALLY released a DVD version of the VERY seldom seen Robert Mitchum aviation classic, THE HUNTERS. My advance ordered copy from Amazon just arrived.\n\nThis is one of two war films Mitchum made for Dick Powell. The other one, the submariner classic THE ENEMY BELOW, has been widely available for the last 10 years at least. I don&apos;t understand why the long delay in releasing THE HUNTERS... but finally, the wait is over.\n\nThe Korean War has long been a forgotten conflict in American history, and the air war there has been almost completely ignored by Hollywood.\n\nThat&apos;s a shame. Fighter combat in Korea marked a significant transition period in air warfare. \n\nThe Korean War fighter pilots were the last of the old Stick and Rudder fliers. They were the last generation of knights of the sky who fought with gallantry and a respect for the skills and courage of their opponents. Even tho they were officially enemies, wearing the uniforms of different nations, the unspoken truth was that every pilot was the brother of everyone else who flew. In common they&apos;d shared the thrill of flight, and the dangers that came along with it. They might fight to the death in the skies, but these warriors understood and respected each other. \n\nAfter Korea, the airplanes became technologically advanced and ended the old ways of thinking. It was no longer a man to man confrontation; air combat became a matter of triggering a missile that killed your enemy 30 miles away, and you often never even saw your foe or his airplane. Air warfare became impersonal and detached.\n\nIn Korea, combat flying was still a very personal matter. The PILOT still flew, and FOUGHT, the AIRPLANE. After that, speeds increased and things in combat happened so quickly that men couldn&apos;t control them directly anymore... the old piloting skills were replaced by electronics, and the pilot became a mere backup system in case a fuse blew, and in reality the AIRPLANE flew the PILOT. He was just a piece of hardware... the Nut that held the stick and throttle!\n\nThere&apos;s a big difference between the men in THE HUNTERS and those in TOP GUN. I have my doubts that Maverick would have acquitted himself very well over Korea. Mitchum as Cleve Seville is a direct descendant of Flynn and Niven in THE DAWN PATROL, and Cruise in TOP GUN is a very different animal.\n\nAs far as the CD production is concerned... I&apos;m surprised that they were able to find as good a print of the movie as they did for the DVD transfer. It appears to me that it&apos;s been digitally cleaned up; it was almost certainly computer processed to take care of color shift in the &apos;50s vintage single strip Technicolor.\n\nWhat was VERY surprising to me was the extra features. I was astonished that the teaser and trailer both feature a vocal theme song by Frankie Lane, the guy who did all those vocals for &apos;50&apos;s westerns! You probably remember him best for his vocal on the theme of Mel Brooks&apos; BLAZING SADDLES.\n\nI always thought that the music for THE HUNTERS was badly overblown, but after hearing the ill conceived Frankie Lane theme song, I can now appreciate the film&apos;s score as VASTLY preferable... I like Lane, but THIS effort definitely STINKS, and invokes little more than shocked laughter.\n\nWell, fellow airplane nuts, the waiting is over. GET YOUR COPY NOW of one of the most sought after aviation films ever made.",

The film&apos;s plot is at least plausible; particularly in today&apos;s atmosphere of terrorism and the military&apos;s ever growing power to `contain&apos; it.  One can imagine a rouge military officer or two taking matters into their own hands so as to `do their duty&apos;.\n\nAs for the acting in the film, again, not the best, but not the worst.  Bill Pullman plays `Conner Gallagher&apos; the rough around the edges body guard, and Lena Olin plays `Faith Mattis&apos; the federal judge Gallagher is assigned to protect.  Both Pullman and Olin turn in descent performances.  As for the rest of the cast, well, the acting goes steadily down hill form there.  As with any B-movie like Ignition, checking your sense of reality at the door helps one enjoy the movie.  However with some B-flicks, no amount of imagination can make the movie watchable.  Ignition is certainly at least one cut above that kind of movie.  And, in fact, it might even be a bit better than that.  \n\nOver all, if you don&apos;t have anything better to do, watch it.  You might like it."

I think this movie was never released in the Netherlands. Luckily it&apos;s now available on DVD.  The movie is mainly Icelandic-spoken; some parts in English and French. The only problem I have with this movie is that it&apos;s hard to like any of the characters in this movie. They are all anti-social, selfish and cruel. I hope this movie is not an accurate portrayal of Icelandic social life. The only human person Françoise is from France (is there a message here?), played excellently by Hélène de Fougerolles. But her character is annoyingly passive at the crucial points at the end of the story; I found this not very convincing because at the start of the movie she&apos;s showing a lot of initiative.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s nothing new about the story of Na Tum Jaano Na Hum. It is a pretty ordinary film where writing is concerned, telling the story of two good friends falling for the same girl without knowing about each other&apos;s feelings. The girl herself becomes engaged to one while being in love with the other. Yeh, this is quite typical but the movie has its moments and is actually quite charming at some points, especially the scenes involving Hrithik Roshan and Esha Deol. Otherwise the movie also has many moments of pure bore which seem to be the direct result of the director&apos;s attempts to make the movie slow in order to create a deep dramatic mood. I liked the songs: &quot;Di Leke&quot; is very nice, but my favourite song is &quot;Tum&quot;. The performance by the playback singer who sings it is not particularly good, but the melody and the way the number appears on screen is quite effective. The movie stars Saif Ali Khan, and he is very likable and believable in another role that is both comic and serious. Esha Deol is actually pretty good in one of her first roles, but she once again tends to have a very serious expression on her face throughout the film. Maybe it&apos;s her own nature and way of being in real life which she is unable to erase when she is on screen, but otherwise she is convincing. The one who dominates the show with a heartfelt portrayal of a quietly loving guy is of course Hrithik Roshan, who plays the role with dedication and sincerity. The cast, however, is not reason enough to make the movie better than it was. Na Tum Jaano Na Hum is mostly an average product, a decent one-time watch and nothing more.",

Mary-Kate and Ashley have really become even more beautiful and talented as you can see in this movie, and they are really good at what they do.\n\nNow for all the people out there who watch their movies and complain, why? They aren&apos;t trying to make across the board best sellers or win academy awards! Their movies so far are targeted for a young audience, and honestly, what they are doing is great! Their movies have good morals, entertaining stories, and laughs for kids. They prove that kids don&apos;t need violence or inappropriate humor to be entertained and, maybe even learn something about life.\n\nYou can&apos;t look at movies like these and criticize the girls for making a boring story or being bad actresses, especially if you are older! I mean the girls know who their audience is and they make movies to entertain kids! SO if you are older and you can&apos;t understand this, why watch it and then complain?!?\n\nThese girls have an amazing future ahead of them, they could probably do anything they want with their acting futures. And I respect them for the quality children&apos;s entertainment they have done so far. &quot;Getting There&quot; IS a fun movie for kids and older poeple willing to suspend their obviously more mature tastes to enjoy simple entertainment."

There are not too many clichés in it, and the little acting that is in the movie is quite good.\n\nI was a bit disappointed by the animations. I think they could have been a bit better.

      "reviewBody": "Free Radicals: A History of Experimental Film (2012)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nGood documentary covering a brief history of the experimental films that gained popularity over the past four decades, although the avant-garde cinema has been around for as long as film has. If you&apos;re familiar with names like Stan Brakhage, Robert Breer, Maurice Lemaitre and Ken Jacobs then you&apos;re really going to enjoy this documentary because you get to hear from them as well as various other filmmakers who create these types of films. If you&apos;re unaware of these names then you&apos;re still going to have a good time watching this because you&apos;re going to get to see some great film clips and learn a little bit of history. The &quot;A&quot; in the title is a strong one to pay attention to because the film doesn&apos;t set out to the &quot;the&quot; history of experimental films but instead just a certain aspect of it. I think someone like Georges Meliels could have been included here and there are some other famous early avant-garde films that are not mentioned. Instead, the documentary really focuses on films that happened after WWII and this is where the before mentioned names come into play. There&apos;s also talk about some of the hard times that these filmmakers would face as there&apos;s certainly not much funding for these types of movies and there are even smaller crowds willing to watch them."

Simon Callow nearly steals the film as Gareth..He is one of the world&apos;s finest stage actors and its nice to see him get a film role he can really sink his teeth into. Andie McDowall is very convincing as the object of Grant&apos;s affection  and Corin Redgrave has a well acted cameo as McDowall&apos;s fiancee Hamish. over all a jolly good film,funny,touching and sharp."

Still, I love this film, even because I consider it to be a very appropriate filming.\n\nHesse&apos;s characters are mostly soul-searchers wandering around in rather artificial surroundings - which is true in the case of this timeless, ancient India. As he is prone to put all the meaning into lengthy, philosophical dialogues, this makes him utterly difficult to turn into film.\n\nThis film manages to capture both: the artificiality of the setting as well as the philosophical sincereness - plus that certain naive sense of beauty that makes Hesse so appealing and disgusting at once. A good deal of the films success is due to Sven Nykvist&apos;s marvellous camera work, done mostly with natural light. (The few scenes with set light are awful.) The beauty of the landscapes is not only the superficial one of a postcard, but the philosophical one that tells you that a beautiful world is essentially a good, complete, happy world: a world in which you can afford to completely focus on your personal search for meaning and spirituality. Well, personally I don&apos;t believe this, but this movie had me suspending my belief for 90 minutes. What a comforting experience."

      "reviewBody": "Overall, I would say the film wasn&apos;t bad.  Full marks for embracing the radical concept that Hitler was a human being.\n\nReading many of the comments posted here, I would say that the film has been somewhat misunderstood.  Understandably, the viewers focus on the portrayal of Hitler.  But the film is titled &quot;Max&quot;, not &quot;Adolf.&quot;  Max, the art dealer, is the focal character of the story, not Hitler.  I think that the film shows the blindness of so many Germans in the interwar years, people who saw what they wanted to see in Hitler and ignored the rest.  Max saw Hitler as an amusing ex-soldier artist and futurist, and brushed off the ideology underlying his futurist visions.  Max is emblematic of an army that saw his desire to rearm and ignored the ideology that would strip the army of its historic identity, of business owners who saw his committment to controling labor but ignored the ideology which would also put a stranglehold on business, of ordinary Germans who saw a strong leader to deal with their country&apos;s problems but ignored his desire for war and conquest.  As recently pointed out in Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;Anything Else&quot;, there were German Jews who supported Hitler, because they saw a strong leader.  To me, &quot;Max&quot; is the story of the blindness that overcame so many Germans, blindness that paved the way for Hitler&apos;s rise to power.\n\nI&apos;ve read in a few comments that Hitler claims, in the film, to have not been anti-Semitic.  That is not correct.  Rather, as he says in the barracks, he opposes &quot;emotional&quot; anti-Semitism.  In his mind, anti-Semitism should be based on &quot;scientific&quot; fact rather than raw emotions.  To him, it is a self-evident truth arrived at logically by observing the Jews and their ways.  This is historically correct.  His big anti-Semitic speech at the end of the film is taken straight out of Mein Kampf, and shows this approach."

      "reviewBody": "From the Irish and Scottish film boards a nice gritty horror that plays out like a great short story. Quite creepy with solid main performances from Cosmo (Braveheart and Game of Thrones) a world class actor and newcomer Barnard. This reminds me of another similarly gritty Celtic collaboration. A great Urban horror set in dangerous Scottish estates abandoned it seems by police and society where fear breeds. The agoraphobia of the main character is done well I thought and that different angle and its subsequent analogy of escaping from the hopeless forgotten edges of society added another dimension to the main character. Cosmo is great as always as the unorthodox priest and you&apos;ll not be seeing him waving about any bibles trying to dispossess anyone. The only complaint I will make is a scene which isn&apos;t really essential in which some dodgy CGI is employed. The main character might look a bit over made up in his attempt to look like a sleep deprived fear driven man, but otherwise I really enjoyed this film done on an extremely modest budget displaying just how to make a modern urban horror.",

The cinematography captured the bright lights of Vegas particularly well and the sheer fun and excitement of what they were doing was well communicated to the audience. It plays the twists and turns in a similar way to the Ocean&apos;s series and there was a flavour of those here. My 12 year-old son thought it was great and although there were some adult themes it was played in an easy-going harmless style.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s nothing I could say or any review here that could prepare you for the wild ride documentary of this man&apos;s life. Not being a fan, I couldn&apos;t appreciate nor see any talent as maybe his admirers would, still though, this is very intriguing. If you want to see a man who lived his life to the very edge of extremity and brink of insanity, I present G.G. Allin. Punk Rock, Death Metal, Satanic or White Supremicist Rock Groups all look like a PBS program for pre-schoolers compared to this man. I suppose the one question we ask ourselves while watching this, as you realize you actually are watching is, &quot;shouldn&apos;t this guy be institutionalized?&quot; There&apos;s some very deserving folks locked away for lesser reasons, yet because he was classified (by some) as a performer, he was free to be exposed (and expose himself) to the general population and even entertain. Like Lenny Bruce, G. G. Allin doesn&apos;t apologize for its shock value. This is serious stuff, not for the weak and yes, you will be disturbed with its content. As a documentary it does pull you in and well presents G. G. to a point where you understand his point of view and in some odd way sympathize with his way of thinking and living. He lived a harsh life and it was his way of expressing outrage and coping in society with equal disgust. Like an animal on display at a zoo, you wonder what the animal thinks of you might better describe his act. If you ever wanted a taste of the wild side this is as close as you&apos;ll get without being there and might appreciate your quiet life more once seeing it. It&apos;s more than a documentary, it&apos;s an experience, one that will haunt and disturb you long after. So before you dismiss this as just a story of an insane and sickening man claiming to be an entertainer, watch it with an open mind and a good stomach, you&apos;ll definitely need it, and be happy you survived. This is as gritty as you&apos;ll see outside a snuff film.",

      "name": "Realistic, Atmospheric and Memorable Adaptation of John Wyndham&apos;s Novel",
      "reviewBody": "This is a well-told film that lacks post-1994 incredible special effects expenditures and massive overspending. What it has is a very solid story line, a number of memorable scenes and a feel of realism about it that adds a great deal I suggest to its eerie sci-fi atmosphere. Its central character, Bill, a career seaman played expertly by Howard Keel, is a man facing an nightmare. The film begins in a small typical and beautifully-presented small London hospital where he has to wait one more day before removing bandages to ensure that his vision will return to normal. Banter with a lovely nurse and his doctor turn into a prescient strangeness the next morning--when Keel awakes to find the hospital abandoned, all floors silent amid signs of damage and swift departure...Telephones are not working either. He removes his bandages to find a world without people. We learn, through his adventures and those of a couple in an isolated lighthouse off the coast, where the husband does scientific experiments and drinks too much, that a shower of meteors watched by billions, have destroyed their optic nerves and thus rendered nearly everyone blind. We soon learn that this is a worldwide phenomenon. In addition, a species of plants called triffids have developed from being small insect eating plants into towering and motile monstrosities that can sting and paralyze then absorb human beings as food. They spray small spores to propagate, are reproducing in millions and thus threaten all remaining human life. Keel picks up a young girl who can also see; and after escaping a crowd of the desperate in London and witnessing an attempt at an airliner landing turning into a massive explosion, they escapes from the city. Thereafter, their adventures deal with the plants&apos; attacks, attempts to reach the continent and a rendezvous in Paris and then one in Spain; but the bulk of the film involves the couples&apos; lonely battle with the triffids on their isolated island, and Keel&apos;s final escape from a doomed French haven with Nicole Maurey and the young girls as they make for a submarine pickup, the last scheduled for Europe&apos;s remaining sighted persons. The great task that everyone faces during the film is striving against all odds to find some way of defeating the plants as well simply escaping. The piece&apos;s screenplay by veteran Philip Yordan, adapted from a good John Wyndham novel, I find to be rather satisfying. Steve Sekely directed in swift-paced and intelligent style. The competent cast besides Keel, a most underrated leading man, include strong Kieron More and Janette Scott as the couple in the lighthouse, Mervyn Johns, Alison Leggatt, Geoffrey Mathews, Ewan Roberts, Janina Faye as the young girl picked up by Keel, Gilgi Hauser, pretty Carol Ann Ford, Colette Wild as the lovely nurse and Victor Brooks, among others. This estimable film was produced by Yordan, with George Pitcher as line producer assisted by Bernard Glasser. Rod Goodwin&apos;s musical score is powerful and well-above-average at all points. the cinematography by Ted Moore and Cedric Dawe&apos;s gritty art direction are also noteworthy. The film looks back I suggest to previous 1950s color sci-fi efforts; but its plants also became the model for the Star Trek &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; spore-producing vegetation.. And its generally serious feel was copied many times thereafter, both the lighthouse sequence and the cross-country adventures of keep and his companions. But these achievements have seldom been approached let alone bettered. Anyone viewing the film today I assert should respond to its unusual realism; complaints about a lack of multi-million dollar graphics are undoubtedly more than misplaced. The storyline was a difficult one to capture in a brief film even in the 1960s. I suggest that the makers have done this exacting task rather admirably. Scenes such as the surrounding of an electrified yard by the carnivorous plants, the airliner&apos;s approach and crash, and the escape of Keel, Faye and Maurey from her house when it is taken over by convicts deserve critical acclaim. I judge this effort to be one of the most underrated of sci-fi films of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment (1963) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nRobert Drew&apos;s fascinating documentary takes a look at the battle between President Kennedy and Alabama Governor George Wallace. Kennedy and his brother Robert are seen trying to get Wallace to step down and allow two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama but the governor stands to his ground. After PRIMARY, director Drew was given more access to Kennedy and it&apos;s pretty clear that the two of them knew this decision would be something big so it&apos;s pretty incredible that so much was able to be captured for this film. It runs just 53-minutes but there&apos;s certainly some drama here even though you know what happened at the school. I thought the film was extremely well-made and especially towards the end when the countdown starts on getting the two students into the school. Getting to see Robert Kennedy listening to what&apos;s going on in Alabama was pretty fascinating and you can see the drama going on just by looking at his face. Also, seeing the aftermath of the events was also rather special. It&apos;s hard to believe that this film was released just a month before Kennedy was assassinated so in some ways that gives it even more power when viewed today. It&apos;s hard to believe that this type of stuff was happening such a short time ago but this documentary does a very good job at capturing the moods at the time."

      "reviewBody": "Enjo Kosai (compensated dating) is nothing new, and if you go to Shibuya, even now there are girls who comes and asks you for your &quot;support&quot; (literally translates to Enjo). There&apos;s a market for it as seen on this movie, and it has become easy way for high school girls to gain money.\n\nFour girls are friends at school. Each has reason to go on Enjo Kosai. Hiromi is new to all this, but she first starts with going to karaoke house with middle aged man with her friends. Gradually, she starts to do it on her own. Her parents of course knows nothing about this. Hiromi has a goal of making enough money to buy an expensive ring she saw. She thinks its not so difficult, and gets dating appointments over phone. But reality of life is about to give her a lesson.\n\nThis type of activity is very easy in Japan where there are many karaoke booth, and so called love hotels. It&apos;s easy to get lost in the crowd and blend in as not to be conspicuous. All the girls take full advantage of the society they live in. But such activities are not without risk, and that seems to be the point if there&apos;s any about this movie.\n\nMovies about prostitution has been made before and this is another modern take on it. The movie provides inside look of Japanese society, and is an interesting story to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Now, this is actually worth going to some trouble to see. Probably not to everyone&apos;s taste -- the opening sequence, with a nimble-footed and saturnine Alan-a-Dale strumming the theme-song ballad, will sort out the sheep from the goats of those who simply can&apos;t stand this sort of thing -- but despite the live-action Disney label, it stands up well amongst all its predecessors and successors.\n\nIt steers a skillful and essential line between tendentious over-seriousness and pie-in-the-face humour, and contrives a fresh view on the familiar set-pieces -- the shivered arrow on the bull&apos;s-eye, Friar Tuck and the river crossing, the recruitment of Little John -- with, unusually, a sizable part for the formidable Eleanor of Aquitaine as the mother of the King and Prince John. In the title role, Richard Todd makes a charming curly-headed rogue, whose merry eyes betray his identity beneath the most enveloping of disguises, and he brings the necessary charisma and impudence to the character: this is the recognisable Robin Hood of legend, whom men follow for freedom and for the fun of it. A little easy-going, perhaps, with little of the passion against injustice that flashes beneath the laughter of Errol Flynn, but this is Disney after all.\n\nJoan Rice is a spitfire wilful Marian, whose involvement is plausibly scripted without any anachronism; she also provides a couple of the best moments in the film, whether belabouring Robin on her fellow-travellers&apos; behalf or silencing him with an athletic embrace at the end. James Hayter as Friar Tuck and Peter Finch as the black-avised Sheriff of Nottingham also give memorable performances -- and could that really have been avuncular Hubert Gregg, of all people, convincing us as Prince John?\n\nMy main source of irritation about this film lay in some of the archery embellishments. Every arrow-shot we see zips past with the whine of a ricocheted bullet, presumably in order to make the fights sound more exciting in the absence of gunfire, and the system of signalling by firing colour-coded arrows in relays at one another seemed not only out of place but highly risky (credibility not helped by what I surely didn&apos;t imagine as people turning round to look as they hear the arrow coming!) The distinctly unpleasant fate of the forsworn Sheriff, on the other hand, was glossed over in suspicious silence, without so much as a cry.\n\nBut caveats aside, the film scores well on sheer energy, with a healthy dash of humour. The 1967 &quot;A Challenge for Robin Hood&quot; (despite featuring Hayter as Friar Tuck again!) is an over-bright and sanitised Ladybird rendition; the 1990 &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (the non-Costner version) went the other way and overdid the historical grime. The latter is the better film, but neither of them has the enjoyability and spirit of the 1952 offering. This isn&apos;t on the same scale as the Curtiz/Keighley classic of 1938, and Todd remains an engaging boy rather than a rollicking leader of men, but it perhaps comes closest to matching the verve of its illustrious predecessor.",

      "reviewBody": "The story of The Invisible Man is updated for the 21st century in this tale of research scientists who&apos;ve managed to turn animals invisible and then bring them back, and the arrogant egomaniac in charge, Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon). He&apos;s ready to start testing the process on people, and offers himself up as the guinea pig. Trouble arises when they can&apos;t make him visible again, and he becomes utterly frustrated, then gleeful when he realizes the power he holds. So it&apos;s then a very short trip into psycho territory for this genius, who begins to terrorize various unlucky individuals, including his own team. The movie is certainly not without its flaws, as eventually it does turn pretty routine, a high tech, sci-fi slasher with an overblown, Hollywood style climax, characters who start acting rather dumb, and, to top it all off, a villain whose virtual indestructibility makes him akin to a typical horror movie antagonist. Still, it&apos;s extremely well made technically, with director Paul Verhoeven in fine form, and does have a substantially nasty edge that may amuse some fans of the genre. Even at an hour and 53 minutes, it is paced fairly well, and gets a lot of mileage from Bacon&apos;s fun villainous portrayal. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin also do fairly well as the co-leads trying to keep their romance secret, knowing well how ugly Caine&apos;s reaction would be to the truth. The main reason to see this movie are the eye popping special effects, especially as we see characters like Caine and the gorilla go through stages of visibility. Even with its flaws, the movie is undeniably exciting and far from boring. Followed by a direct to DVD sequel six years later. Seven out of 10.",

Paramount obviously spared no expense on this one and, despite some minor objections, I recall being thoroughly entertained by it, especially that absolutely savage battle-to-the-death between Basil Rathbone&apos;s quintessentially dastardly villain and a desperately determined Joan Fontaine.\n\nSome years back I somewhere read that, while waiting in full makeup and costumes for the lighting technicians to work their magic, Miss Fontaine rather scathingly queried her costar, Arturo de Cordova, why he was pursuing a career as an actor, apparently with the implication that it was an occupation unworthy of a man.  If that&apos;s the kind of treatment he had to undergo at the hands of a Hollywood leading lady, one can confidently guess that his much greater success in Latin American cinema left him with few regrets that his Hollywood sojourn never amounted to much."

I had never cried during the &quot;water&quot; scene, but I did this time.  The scene in the dining room is magnificently filmed and exhausting to watch...to think Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft performed that scene every night on Broadway!  Supposedly they wore multiple layers of padding.  I don&apos;t know why they didn&apos;t create a new category for the Oscars that year, Best Double Performance in Leading Roles.  They both richly deserved the Oscars they won, but I really couldn&apos;t choose between a leading role and a supporting role in that movie since Duke and Bancroft created such a beautiful and moving partnership.  Having read a great deal about Helen Keller, including her own autobiography, I am still always amazed by her story and accomplishments.  This movie is a brilliant testament to human strength."

He brings nothing to this except his name. He had not even appeared in it before I turned it off an hour in.\n\nQuick synopsis the main star of the movie is a karate champion who lost a rigged fight (possibly against Seagal) I&apos;m not 100% sure. As he is fighting this fight his wife dies during childbirth and his daughter put into an orphanage. He gets her back, stops fighting and becomes a cop. He loses that job for being too aggressive and turns to cage fighting to pay the bills!! Then in a move only a soap opera writer from Days Of Our Lives could come up with, the mother did not die and she wants her little girl back.\n\nForgettable.",

      "reviewBody": "Now before I begin this review let me clear the fact that this MOVIE is aiming for the new younger audience. This movie is not focusing on aiming for the fans of the past generation. So lets look at it this way.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is directed by Jonathan Liebsman and Produced by Michael Bay. It stars Megan Fox as April O&apos;Neil, and 4 turtles who don&apos;t look that good with the CGI. With this kind of set up, its already predictable that this would be a disaster.\n\nAs I watched this movie in a theater packed with a tremendous amount of children. I guess I could say, this movie was entertaining for me. The stars of the movie are, hands down the Turtles especially Mikey. They stole the movie in every scene they were in, and I would watch a 1 hour movie with just all of them goofing around and making jokes. However, in fact the movie often negates the fact that the turtles are the main subject in this movie, it circles it&apos;s story mostly around April O&apos;Neil. As for her character, I found her annoying at many times. And because Michael Bay has something to do with this movie, Megan Fox had to do scenes for the &quot;benefit&apos; of Bay as usual. Going back to the turtles, I think that they had nailed them and captured everything that we loved about them, the movie is worth watching because of them. The Villains are one of the weak points of this film. Shredder is a very dull, boring and predictable villain. He is only there for what I believe is fan service. Other than that, his motives are unclear and the reason he is in this movie is for the battle scenes.\n\nAs for the story, it is filled with unbelievable amounts of cliché. Because of this, I had no choice but to be irritated at times or sometimes these scenes gave no effect to me whatsoever even if the main intention of the scene was entirely different. The evil plot of the villain, was downright cringe worthy, plot holes were circling from there and there. . Clichés and plot holes aside, the story is what I would imagine for children and all of us were to look it that way, then I guess I could say the plot was alright I guess. The action sequences were just OK, there were some that were interesting and some that was incredibly DIFFICULT to watch. I know Michael Bay didn&apos;t direct this, but My God. Every Michael Bay action-cliché is in this movie. The Slow Motion, Explosions, Attractive Women and the incredibly shaky camera. I almost felt dizzy watching some of the action sequences. \n\nAt the end of the day, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a great movie to watch if you want bonding times with your kids or if you&apos;re totally high or craving for some pizza. In my opinion, it won&apos;t ruin your childhood, in fact it might even remind and bring back old memories of your childhood, with the many references being made in this movie. The kids will love this movie and I recommend everyone to bring pizza while watching it. \n\nA dull and boring villain, a mediocre plot filled with a massive amount of clichés and Michael Bay style action sequences. without the Turtles, this movie would be pure trash.\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "This may not be the best version of the story (The Man in the Iron Mask), but its period production values, good pace and some of its top cast lift it above the &quot;B&quot; remake some would rate it.\n\nIt perhaps marks a minor renaissance of the unrepentant swashbuckler movie. Beautifully filmed on location (Vienna passing for Paris), it delights the eye. There is enough slapstick sword-fighting to please all but the absolute connoisseur; the tension of the plot is well maintained; it is simply fun to watch. Memorable performances by Rex Harrison as Colbert (in one of his last movie roles) and Ian McShane as Fouquet help to keep the viewer&apos;s attentions when others of the rather mixed cast falter.\n\nUrsula Andress&apos; (or &quot;Ursula Undress&quot; as she was somewhat unfairly nicknamed after a Playboy Magazine appearance) convincing portrayal of the King&apos;s mistress would undoubtedly have been enhanced (as other commentators have suggested) by the restoration of the nudity cut by the US censors (the American running time is 12 minutes shorter than the British).\n\nAll in all, not a movie to buy for one&apos;s DVD library, but to rent for a rainy day or watch on TV and appreciate for its fun.",

      "reviewBody": "The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world&apos;s view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.\n\nAs extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.\n\nThe movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world&apos;s most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.\n\n Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael&apos;s father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.\n\nThe screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (&quot;Keep your friends close .....&quot;, &quot;I don&apos;t want to kill everyone, just my enemies&quot;), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.\n\nAll of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it&apos;s what&apos;s deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.\n\nThe Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man&apos;s life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.\n\nThe great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father&apos;s empire was built on love and respect, Michael&apos;s empire is built on fear and violent treachery.\n\nSee this movie. It&apos;s three-and-a-half hours very well spent.",

      "reviewBody": "M / (1931) **** \n\n\t&quot;M&quot; is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama. The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens. Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the film&apos;s many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations. This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer, blending terror, complexity, and malignity in one amazing motion picture.\n\n\tScreenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of &quot;M&quot; with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions. Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script. In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own; they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere.\n\n\tFabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching. This resplendent component creates the film&apos;s terrific moody ambiance. Suspense is one thing &quot;M&quot; contains in full context. The movie&apos;s third act is sheer peak-high tension.\n\n\tShot in black and white, &quot;M&quot; stars Peter Lorre as Peter-Hans Beckert, an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood. Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated. \n\n\tThis picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup. The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening. Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line.\n\n\tThe film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly. &quot;M&quot; is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer. Never do we directly witness a murder; the violent encounters are implied. This method of film making perhaps makes the movie&apos;s impact even greater. With an creative perspective through a third person point of view, the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences. \n\n\t&quot;M&quot; offers a unforgettable, challenging performance by Peter Lorre. This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct. He perspires with momentum and rapture. This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer. Isn&apos;t this what movies are supposed to do?",

My kids (7y &amp; 5y) love it.\n\nThe idea about having your soul animal is always good. There are a lot of books and movies out there tackling this idea.\n\nWith this movie they created a very nice twist on that idea.\n\nMy highlights: \n* Animals are likeable and funny\n* Songs are surprisingly catchy and well sung\n* Story is more than solid\n\n\nSince the movie was so good we also are now looking into the books and audiobooks. So the movie was a nice entry point for getting into this universe.",

The version i watched suffered badly from a &apos;pan-and-scan&apos; transfer, which is a shame because the movie is quite well made. Loads of running about, shooting and vengeance for dead family members. Seems run of the mill now, but worth watching none the less.\n\nReleased in the UK on Intervision Video"

But the oversight was probably intentional since once viewed there is little here that is either memorable or worth much.\n\nIt is nothing if not a bit strange in its crossing of the Gangster/Human Monster genres. What it delivers is some titillating and quite tantalizing lingerie shots and cleavage obsessions with a couple of semi-violent confrontations with very little imagination. Hardly enough to carry the Movie.\n\nThe editing and pacing are confusing and everything looks bizarrely placed and haphazard. The Sci-Fi parts are unimpressive, mostly because by this time there had been quite a lot of wild and crazy mutants running around both on the Big Screen and on TV. So what we have here is quite dull and depressing.\n\nIt fails on almost every level and is a discovered disaster that might have been better off left in the dustbin of failed rip-offs, and Day Late-Dollar Short productions.",

When Stallone finally catches his man, he is found guilty of killing a group of innocent civilians at the same time; and they are both given sentences in the new cryo-prison. When Simon Pheonix escapes into a new world in the year 2032, the police have no way of dealing with such a vicious arch-criminal so they re-animate John Sparton, and so it begins.\n\nI simply love the way the future is portrayed in this film, it is a wonderfully satirical crime free environment where the humans have become ultra-placid geeks under the new regime. Sandra Bullock and Nigel Hawthorne are the two main police-persons that we see and they are brilliantly funny in their performances.\n\nDemolition man is as funny as it is action packed and although it&apos;s pretty shallow, it is still great fun to watch.\n\n7/10",

      "name": "A Good But Not Great Exploration of the Nature of Good in Times of Evil",
      "reviewBody": "There are two constituencies for director Istvan Szabo&apos;s &quot;Taking Sides,&quot; a story of famed conductor (and not so well known composer) Wilhelm Furtwangler&apos;s accountability for his actions in Germany and occupied Europe during World War II. One is a relatively small coterie of devoted classical music lovers, few of whom are old enough to have ever seen the maestro conduct but who know his penetratingly brilliant conducting through recordings. The larger audience is attracted to unending and largely unresolvable issues of good versus evil and the degree to which one is responsible for the atrocities committed by a society but not by the individual who serves some of its needs.\n\nWilhelm Furtwangler was a world-heralded conductor before World War II. Along with a handful of European podium titans - Mengelberg, Walter, Klemperer and Toscanini - these men in essence controlled classical music, both with regard to concert programming and the rapidly developing technological advances of the phonograph disc.\n\nWith the rise of fascism, some conductors, composers and musicians fled the grasp of tyrannous regimes. A few, like Toscanini, had little choice (a beating administered by Italian thugs as payment for his refusing to honor Mussolini from the stage was a fair indication that New York offered better prospects). Walter and Klemperer decamped, their careers boosted by their strong anti-Nazi stances. Mengelberg collaborated, essentially ruining his career when victory came (his is a complex case still debated).\n\nFurtwangler, with many opportunities to leave, didn&apos;t. Indeed his conducting during the Third Reich was without doubt the hallmark of German classical music during those twelve indescribably dark years. Why didn&apos;t he leave? He knew that culture was being obliterated by the stroke of a pen or a dictator&apos;s speech. Mendelssohn, whose works he had often performed, was now a non-existent presence in German music. Beethoven and Bruckner, composers Furtwangler loved, were deified for political purposes. Did he believe his presence would preserve essential elements of the German music heritage until a better day?\n\n&quot;Taking Sides&quot; addresses Furtwangler&apos;s role and focuses, with flashbacks, on an American major&apos;s investigation - shrill, unsophisticated, uncultured American Philistine at its best (worst?) - of Furtwangler&apos;s role. A former insurance investigator called to the colors, Harvey Keitel&apos;s major is effective as the kind of American officer that many of us have encountered overseas, usually with embarrassment. He is a tenacious bulldog gripping on to a prey he can never truly understand. And he doesn&apos;t want to anyway. His savage, histrionic pursuit of Furtwangler blurs the portrayal of the complex conductor.\n\nStellan Skarsgard is Furtwangler, alternately triumphant on the podium, disturbed by inner doubts and mortifyingly humiliated by the major&apos;s treatment which would have been appropriate for investigating a Gestapo officer or a concentration camp commandant. The rest of the cast acts well but their supportive and in some instances distractive roles add little.\n\nA romance between an idealistic American lieutenant who proclaims he is a man of culture before he is a Jew and a winsome fraulein is unrealistic, is irrelevant, not even interesting. &quot;Taking Sides&quot; is a somewhat less sophisticated descendant of Spencer Tracy and Maximillian Schell&apos;s blazing encounter in &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; Schell, acting the part of a judge in Nazi Germany who slowly accepted the abnegation of the rule of law, was forced to confront his true contribution to evil. Spencer Tracy saw to that and, in any event, Harvey Keitel is no Tracy.\n\nFurtwangler in the film is never suspected, much less accused of any crime other than being a championed symbol of German &quot;kultur.&quot; That was not a war crime and in reality figures like Furtwangler and composer Richard Strauss (another difficult case) were processed through denazification proceedings fairly quickly and usually were cleared. Some were not (Mengelberg, for example).\n\nThe problem with &quot;Taking Sides,&quot; beyond its simplistic polarization, is that it does not address, and perhaps could not, the complexity of the role of classical music and musicians in the ideology of Nazism. Furtwangler may not have known of extermination camps and he certainly hurt no Jews (indeed, the record is clear that he saved some Jewish musicians as did Mengelberg) but he must internally have abhorred the Nazi extinction of music by composers such as Mendelssohn and contemporary composers whose works were denounced as &quot;entartete musik&quot; (degenerate music). And more than a few of the composers in the latter class were murdered during the regime. Furtwangler definitely knew that composers and musicians disappeared with no forwarding addresses.\n\nKeitel and Skarsgard act out a morality inquisition that does provoke the viewer to think and question but the ultimate issue, should Furtwangler have fled, is irritatingly vague. Did Furtwangler &quot;take sides&quot; in any meaningful sense? Did he stay beyond the point where leaving was an option? Maybe. Can we, should we, expect composers and conductors to be like Leonard Bernstein, outspoken advocates on every issue? Is that fair?\n\nGerman conductors had powerful patrons and without doubt Furtwangler&apos;s brilliant conducting served the interests of both the leaders and audiences that hungered, through bombings and the approach of defeat, for some relief through music. I have a recording of Furtwangler conducting Beethoven&apos;s magisterial Ninth Symphony in Berlin where anti-aircraft fire and bombs can be heard. What did it take for Londoners and Berliners to listen to great music at their imminent mortal peril? &quot;Taking Sides&quot; could have explored the almost mystical relationship between Furtwangler and his audiences. It doesn&apos;t really do that although the adulation in which he was held is depicted.\n\nA very fine biography by Shirakawa, &quot;The Devil&apos;s Musician,&quot; largely rescues Furtwangler from accusations of sympathy with the Nazi regime and he clearly was a much finer fellow than his young rival, Herbert von Karajan. Von Karajan was destined to be a great conductor but he was also a first-class careerist who joined the Nazi party to advance his prospects (and lied about it for years until confronted with the evidence).\n\nAnyone seriously interested in classical music during the Third Reich must read Douglas Kater&apos;s three-volume, well-written and extensively researched history of that period. For now, &quot;Taking Sides&quot; is good but not great drama. Selections of music by Bruckner and Beethoven as well as by Glenn Miller and George Gershwin (the latter two decidedly not Nazi favorites) are prominent. Hopefully the movie will impel those unfamiliar with an unsurpassed interpreter of wonderful music to seek out readily available and gripping recordings.\n\n7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I always start any review of a superhero movie by making it clear that these are not my types of movies and my opinion, for any superfans out there, should always be taken with a grain of salt. Now with that in mind, I have to say &apos;The Flash&apos; is about as much as I can enjoy one of these types of movies. This was a very fun ride I&apos;m happy to admit.\n\nThe movie is basically fan-service on overdrive. Anything a mega-fan has always wanted to see is likely going to show up at some stage in this movie. If that&apos;s your kind of thing then you are going to be in heaven.\n\nI found the pacing good. The movie is just short of 2 and a half hours but that time goes by pretty quickly. As usual in these types of superhero movies I found the final battle scene the weakest the film had to offer. It got messy and convoluted and it was really the one part of the movie where I lost interest.\n\nOf all the superhero movies I&apos;ve seen this is probably the one least focused on the villain. He really does feel like an after-thought more than anything. The movie is far more about Barry Allen and his mission. Which makes it surprising to me just how much I enjoyed the film, because the one thing I do often get out of these films is enjoyment from the villain.\n\nI think people are going to have a good time with this one. It doesn&apos;t feel like the usual copy and paste template that the MCU has been throwing out for 15 years now and it is certainly a step up from everything non-Batman that DC has been doing recently. I really enjoyed this. 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "There are exceptions, but mountaineering movies fall roughly into two classes; overblown, unrealistic cliffhanging (in more than one sense) dramas (&apos;Eiger Sanction&apos;, &apos;K2&apos;, &apos;Cliffhanger&apos;, &apos;Vertical Limit&apos;) and rather trite descriptive documentaries often seen as padding for the &apos;National Geographic&apos; channel schedules, although Jon Krakaur&apos;s &apos;Into Thin Air&apos; managed to combine the worst of both worlds. Both classes have in common (usually) Gortex gear, superb mountain scenery and splendid cinematography. What distinguishes this survival story is that it has (sorry about this) high drama, an understated style and absolute authenticity. The actual principals, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, and Richard Hawkins the non-climber base camp minder, narrate their story as it is re-enacted, partly at the original site in Peru (though some filming was done in the European Alps), while actors (with very few lines to say) re-enact the saga of the Siula West Face climb. It all hangs together beautifully; and I was rapt from go to whoa. My disbelief was entirely suspended.\n\nEven documentaries are stories rather than fact (whatever that is) and this story is superbly told, for which director Kevin Macdonald can take full credit, though perhaps one should also thank Simon Yates and Joe Simpson for telling us their stories. One critic has taken the director to task in not dwelling on the moral issues involved  the cutting the rope bit. No mountaineering drama is without one of these but here it actually happened. That critic has missed the point  the approach here is &apos;be your own judge&apos;.\n\nThis film manages to appeal both to mountaineers (a small but highly critical audience) and non-mountaineers. As a (semi-retired) and undistinguished member of the former group, I found few nits to pick, though a more extended explanation of the difference between Alpine-style and Expedition climbing would help to show non-mountaineers that it wasn&apos;t a suicide attempt (though speaking for myself I wouldn&apos;t have tried it with less than four in the party). And as the film was about a climb that went wrong, the joy of climbing, which is not easy to explain to non-mountaineers was rather overshadowed by Joe&apos;s suffering as he dragged himself, leg broken, down the mountain. But never have I seen a more graphic illustration of the adage &apos;never give up&apos;. Lie down to die and you will die. Joe and the Texan doctor on Everest (see &apos;Into Thin Air&apos;) both should have died, yet they survived. In the doctor&apos;s case it seems to have been some primeval instinct (he was not a mountaineer). In Joe&apos;s case he seems to have treated survival as a challenge and focused his thoughts accordingly (&apos;I thought, in twenty minutes I&apos;ll be at the next rock&apos;). I winced every time his broken leg hit something.\n\nTo sum up this is a great film, which will live long in your memory, climber or non-climber. \n\nP.S. Simon was only 20 or so at the time, Joe a more mature 25. Both have kept climbing, though significantly not together.",

Once again, his film deals with family dynamics: in this case, a widowed mother who has worked selflessly to provide her son with an education. But when she goes to visit him, she finds that he has not fulfilled his promise: he&apos;s stuck in a mediocre job, he has a wife and child and can&apos;t make any drastic changes because of his responsibilities. The ways that the mother and son try to reach an understanding, and their mutual resignation to the disappointments of life, create a glancing but powerful sense of that &quot;quiet desperation&quot; which was so often Ozu&apos;s theme.",

      "reviewBody": "I was fortunate to view this movie in a cinema in the same weekend as I saw a stage performance of Moliere&apos;s &quot;The Learned Ladies&quot; and a DVD of &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. All three deal with the reaction of girls on the brink of womanhood who react in different ways to the pressures society has placed on them. Moliere was a favorite of Louis XIV in 1670, and his treatment of these pressures is remarkably pertinent to out own times. His play is instructive, as is &quot;Towelhead&quot;. By drawing attention to the girls&apos; problems, these dramas are warning us of the way society is treating young women. They are victims. Moliere uses farce and poetry, &quot;Towelhead&quot; uses conflict and some wry humor. The Geisha endures a life of conflict with no comic relief. All three shows produce the same message: don&apos;t let this happen to you. &quot;Towelhead&quot; is reputed to be autobiographical, and &quot;Geisha&quot; would appear to be so.\n\n&quot;Towelhead&quot; is distinguished by some clever cinematography, let down perhaps by some careless editing. Nevertheless, the actors&apos; performances are excellent, with most of the cast in roles that reveal them as childish. The drama unfolds not by having them grow up, but by having the protagonist mature and become decisive, just as did Moliere&apos;s girl did. There is an outstanding performance by Toni Collette as the pregnant neighbor who plays an important part in the youngster&apos;s maturing.",

      "reviewBody": "Really excellent pre-code film, set in wartime London where an ex-chorus girl/current street walker (played by Mae Clarke) heads over to Waterloo Bridge to try and find herself a soldier on leave, and she meets wealthy, baby-faced, nineteen-year-old raw/green Roy and invites him up to her flat. He immediately falls in love and thinks she&apos;s a &quot;good girl&quot;, unaware of her real walk of life. She falls for him too, but keeps putting him off, racked with guilt over her secret &quot;career&quot;. Meanwhile he keeps pressing on, sneaking in her window, tricking her into meeting his family for a weekend of tennis, tea, and cocktails, asking her to marry him, etc. - he&apos;s completely smitten!\n\nTop-notch acting and a good deal of chemistry between the two leads helps make this a really interesting, absorbing film. Their conversations together come across as quite realistic, and the performance given here by Mae Clarke is amazing - extremely well-done and memorable. I also enjoyed seeing a very young Bette Davis who appears here in a very small role as Roy&apos;s sister. Only one thing that bothered me about this film is, why oh why, as I have often seen done in period films made during this time, do they have the actresses appearing in modern, early 30s dresses, rather than period costume? Oh well, still a really first-rate film, well worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a ripoff sure, but who watches a Cannon movie from the 90&apos;s called &quot;American Cyborg: Steel Warrior&quot; and expects originality? Gimme a break. Good acting? Good story? Psh. Forget that nonsense. This is a movie about spin kicks, bone breaking, shootouts, and lots of running. The special effects are on par with Nemesis (1992) and as a low budget sci-fi actioner, it doesn&apos;t disappoint. It has a fast pace (thank god) and lots of action. Those two things are essential for any low budget flick like this. I hate sitting through a movie with &quot;cyborg&quot; or &quot;warrior&quot; in the title, and it&apos;s slow and boring. The filmmakers behind these kinds of movies realized that they had martial artists on their hands and not actors. So they loaded the movies up (most of them) with fighting, and action, and if we&apos;re lucky- some female nudity. I don&apos;t remember if anyone gets naked in &quot;American Cyborg: Steel Warrior&quot; but I do remember plenty of decently choreographed ass kicking. More than all that, the set design (while nothing over original) is fantastic. They really went all out to create a post apocalyptic world here that&apos;s more that just empty wasteland. There are makeshift cities and hideouts here that are visually impressive and alive with color. Lots of rubble, ruins, and neon signs. Just the way I like it. It makes for a perfect backdrop to all the cyborg ass-kicking in the movie. Not to mention the movie has lots of varied sets and villains. I mean, by general standards on IMDb this should be at least a 5.2 Anything less is just unfair. Even Roger Ebert understood that you have to judge a movie based on what it&apos;s intended to do, and who it&apos;s intended for. As a late-night cable actioner, this movie is supposed to keep you entertained and nothing else. I loved it.",

It unfolded as a singularly impressive presentation, immensely compelling even if not entirely comprehensible. Produced in the same year as its American cousin &quot;All That Jazz&quot; it presents two stories dealing with both artistic and personal issues of artists. As I eventually found out, Csontvary Kostka Tivadar was a Hungarian painter, and the actor Latinovitsj Zoltan, who was originally slated to play him in the film, committed suicide during the preliminary planning. The movie incorporates both the stories of both by way of a dazzling series of dazzling images incorporating Grecian, Roman, Jewish, Christian, and possibly more traditions of splendor along the way. It features one of the most pungent alienation sequences I&apos;ve ever seen on film, and also lends an awesome splendor to the artistic calling which is reassuring in a world where this is often swamped and demeaned by commercialism. A great film, highly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "I always find the idea of improvised (or semi-improvised) film making an interesting one, even if the results themselves are disappointing, and very rarely work (exceptions being some of the movies of Christopher Guest and Abel Ferrara). It&apos;s a risky idea because it&apos;s a true test of an actors talent. Some succeed and some fall flat on their faces. &apos;Black and White&apos; is a perfect example of this, for every interesting moment involving say Ben Stiller, or yes, Mike Tyson, there&apos;s way too many dull and rambling scenes that go nowhere (come on down Brooke Shields and Bijou Phillips). What makes this movie even more frustrating is James Toback is obviously aiming for a BIG STATEMENT regarding race relations in contemporary America, yet the movie is so superficial and confused it ultimately says nothing much. Toback is a maddingly uneven film maker, but he is responsible for one of my all time favourite movies, the sadly underrated &apos;Fingers&apos;, so I usually give him the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately &apos;Black and White&apos; is a missed opportunity and has very little to recommend it. I suppose Toback deserves some credit for at least attempting to do something other than mainstream Hollywood dreck, but ultimately a crappy movie is still a crappy movie, no matter how good the intentions."

GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I can&apos;t congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they&apos;re finally potty trained. Actors(or lack thereof): Only the finest for this film... the finest extras ever to grace a screen, now starring in their speaking role debut! As a disclaimer, I have to note that I am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and smirk during Bubble Boy (yes folks, its true); so when I say to avoid something, you KNOW I&apos;m not kidding.",

Edited in someone&apos;s basement one night over a keg of beer.\n\nOne thing sticks in my memory like an oak splinter: the way Spaceman Tom never called King Arthur &apos;your majesty&apos; or &apos;sire,&apos; but instead just plain ol&apos; good ol&apos; &apos;King.&apos; As in &apos;hey, King, get yer hands offa my girl, see.&apos; If you like that sort of talk, and your brain development arrested in grade three, then the team behind &apos;Unidentified Flying Oddball&apos; wants you.\n\nThe science was excellent, however. I know now that if I ever need to defend myself from a deathly laser beam, I need only wear the shiniest armour I can find (&apos;Say, King, gimme yer armor! Now don&apos;t get all persnickety on me, see? I&apos;ll give it back all nice and proper-like, and polished up with good ol&apos; American spit shine&apos;).\n\nDisney produced this matted ass-hair sandwich in the days before they became the media Godzilla they are now. Their stock was leaning into the toilet in those days and, hey, so will you after seeing this film.\n\nIncoherent plot, humourless gags, crummy special effects, poor sets. It&apos;s not a good kid&apos;s film. Not a good film, even though based on a Mark Twain story. But I may change my tune. Perhaps someday I&apos;ll see this movie the way I presume it was meant to be seen. On crack."

As many have commented, this movie has many similarities to &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot;. This movie falls flat in many ways but it&apos;s interesting to watch next the other movie and see how Jimmy took the flopping carps and turned them into leaping dolphins. I particularly enjoyed his one finger handstand. Yes, the special effects are not special at all but still it was fun. On the sad side, whatever happened to the girl in this movie, Cindy Hang Tsin (1951-1978)? I can&apos;t find anything explaining her untimely death.",

      "reviewBody": "Scouting talent for an upcoming film to be shot in Italy, a trio from Hollywood (writer/director Bogart, producer Stevens and publicist O&apos;Brien) travel to Spain to scope renowned local dancing sensation Maria Vargas (Gardner). Immediately, they are struck by her beauty and presence. In fact, Gardner has a profound effect on every man she meets...though the effect is as unique as each man she encounters. Stevens sees a talent to be exploited for all it&apos;s worth and O&apos;Brien sees only huge marquees and dollar signs. But Bogart, after a couple of brief but revealing conversations with Maria, sees so much more. Expecting a naive Spanish peasant eager to grab at the brass ring, he finds instead a woman as smart as she is beautiful, whose main motivation is to enjoy the challenge and escape that a Hollywood career might offer a woman who will nevertheless always value the simpler things in life. Even with her inate beauty and uncommon savvy, to Maria&apos;s detriment she does not have eyes in the back of her head. Told in flashback the viewer experiences her success in Hollywood and her quest to find the true love of a man (Brazzi) that has always eluded her.\n\nIn the hands of Joseph Mankiewicz, &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; frequently bristles with crackling dialogue (would you have expected less?). Unique to this contribution from Mankiewicz is the portent that hangs over the film. As the details of Maria&apos;s life are expounded, empathy for her fate increases accordingly.  Impeccably well-cast, this is actually an ensemble film. Gardner is luminous as Maria, though she is not solely dependent on her looks to carry the film--she gives a real performance. Bogart is stalwart and sympathetic as Maria&apos;s protector. And O&apos;Brien, in an Academy Award-winning turn, is sly and oily as the single-minded publicist who changes allegiances as often as his sweat-soaked shirts. Lensed by the great Jack Cardiff and shot largely in Italy, the European ambiance, as well as the snappy dialogue, push the credibility of the premise a notch or two above so many other so-called exposés of Hollywood excess and pretense.",

The light! The colors! The tracking shots! The sound design! The director general&apos;s giant glass-topped table! Combined with the bold proposition of an architect chasing a wayward train lost in the underground maze that is the subway system of Buenos Aires, the director&apos;s attention to detail makes for a holistically surreal experience. One guy who&apos;s sure to give you the creeps is the ancient, wailing lift boy taking our hero, Daniel Pratt, down to the university basement. Needless to say, the basement doubles as a subway station. On a forgotten line. Heading nowhere. As Pratt says, it&apos;s a strange game. Now Annabel Levy, in the part of his preteen sidekick Abril, I wonder what she&apos;s up to these days. It seems she hasn&apos;t made a movie since. Chances are she disappeared from the set, never to be met with again. What a shame.",

His likeable combination with Rae Dawn Chong (private PI) is naturally brought across. Keaton nails his down-on-his-luck character looking to score big to utter perfection. It&apos;s the two leads, witty banter and some amusing support parts (Meat Loaf&apos;s novel sweaty henchman) that make it watchable.\n\nThey need to be, as the contrived plot is uninteresting and very convoluted. The script is just as perplexing. Never does it fuse together. Something about a corrupt multi-million dollar lotto ring scam with a murder-mystery angle. One or two spontaneous set-pieces work, but for most part the direction remains quite pedestrian.\n\nUsually I like these types of dark comedy-thrillers, where the protagonist/s faces danger around nearly every corner and encountering odd situations along the way. It&apos;s just the story and direction needs to match that level of excitement, in which case it falls short. Real short. You can easily see why this film is forgotten.",

      "reviewBody": "That&apos;s it: no more DVD or web movies to watch, thus i become addict to what French TV can play: for this night before my trip to Malmo, a channel offers this french comedy that brings back for me good memories.\n\nFirst, &quot;Les Ripoux&quot; was maybe the first video game I bought to play then on our TO9+ computer. So it was maybe in 1987. The game was incredible funny to play as the goal was similar to the movie: amass as much money as you can as a bad cop! To do that, you used a sort of Google map limited the Paris district called the golden triangle. There, you met crooks that you had to make talk by choosing lines of dialogs. Maybe the graphics were static but the game-play was really stunning!\n\nNext, it&apos;s Paris in the eighties and this city in that period is really like a magnet to me since my childhood. But, beware the Paris depicted here isn&apos;t the city of lights but rather of darkness as this triangle is a highly deprived area with dense immigrated poor population. As you can see in the movie, it&apos;s looks old and derelict and now, in 2013, as urban renovation is inexistent in Paris to give way to gentrification, it&apos;s even worst!\n\nAs for the story, i think it&apos;s a accurate piece of French culture: We are really down to earth people, happy with a good meal, not really motivated at work, very lenient with rules, at least for the ones that are civil servants like me or those policemen. So France is really this mix between old USSR and a banana republic. The originality of this movie is to expose this truth in a comedy and i admit it&apos;s funny: Lhermitte is a good choice to play the naive, by the book blue cop as much as Noiret is perfect to play the voluble, sympathetic veteran. \n\nWhile watching it, i was thinking to the American buddy cop movie and how this subject of corrupt cops is a bit leftover to prefer big guns, big fights... here, our two bad apples are really rotten to the core and we finally like them: a paradox !",

      "reviewBody": "Director and presenter Michael Madsden (not the same person as the actor of that name) has made a documentary film which may well be unique. Everyone should see it, because it concerns the future of our species and our planet, and it is not a superficial film by any means. He has adopted a moody Alain Resnais-style approach to the subject of the storage of nuclear waste for a necessary 100,000 years. This is not a propaganda film against nuclear energy at all. No comment is made for or against nuclear energy. I cannot understand the bizarre, I might almost say mad, review by a Latvian who claimed that this film was hilarious. Normally I would never criticize a review by another person, but this is such an extreme instance that comment really is required. This film is so far from being hilarious that how anyone could think so is inconceivable to me, and I am forced to doubt the person&apos;s sanity. Perhaps the Latvian reviewer is one of those people who would laugh hysterically upon witnessing the end of the world. Madsden evokes a powerful atmosphere in this film, showing haunting shots of the underground Onkalo (&apos;Hidden Place&apos;) site in Finland where nuclear waste will be stored. The most effective parts of the film however are the amazing interviews with the Finnish and Swedish scientists and technologists (all in English). They are most impressive and deeply thoughtful people. The things revealed in this film about this important subject are truly mind-boggling. The film has an elegiac feel about it, as if it were a message to some future species about who and what the extinct humans once were. The Finns should leave a copy of the film in their underground caverns, in case they are ever entered tens of thousands of years from now. We should also put DVDs of this film into satellites which we send into deep space, as a kind of sad testament to a failed species, in the hope that some other species might find them one day and figure out how to view them, and learn the pathetic lessons of our inability to think sufficiently deeply, which is the fatal flaw of our human kind. Meanwhile, this film should be shown in all schools all over the world with the utmost urgency, and screened on all serious television channels in every country. But of course none of this will happen. I write as someone who has tried so far unsuccessfully to introduce crucial new technology into the storage of nuclear waste. The monstrous complacency and stupidity which I have encountered forces me to face the possibility that our species may become extinct within 100 years. I say this with sad resignation.",

Like the other two films, it plays with time and touches on multiple story lines. However, moving about in time only adds to the confusion of an already muddled story. Inarritu tries but cannot breathe much life into the weak and plodding script. The cast is good but the actors also fail to make their pathetic characters interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "Manos: The Hands of Fate, currently ranked #5 on IMDb&apos;s Bottom 100, is a rite of passage for serious fans of trashy horror movies, marking the transition from &apos;merely bad&apos; to &apos;completely and utterly inept in every way imaginable. It&apos;s a test of fortitude that sees many fall by the wayside; however, those who do manage to go the distance can wear their achievement as a badge of pride, knowing that they have taken the very worst that z-grade horror can throw at them and survived the ordeal (albeit with possible mental scarring).\n\nThe one-and-only film from Harold P. Warren, who obviously realised thereafter that film directing wasn&apos;t his forté, Manos opens with a family driving through the desert on their way to Valley Lodge for a vacation. Unfortunately, father Michael (Harold P. Warren, proving that acting wasn&apos;t his forté either), his wife Margaret (Diane Adelson), and daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) soon find themselves lost, eventually pulling up to a strange desert hostel where they are greeted by twitchy manservant Torgo (John Reynolds), who looks like he stores bags of popcorn or cotton wool down his trousers.\n\nTorgo warns that his master (Tom Neyman) won&apos;t be happy if they stay the night, but they won&apos;t take no for an answer; their stubborn insistence puts them in serious peril, for the master is the head of a Satanic cult and he wants to add Margaret to his collection of brides.\n\nTo list everything that is wrong with this film would take longer than it took me to watch it (including the times where I fell asleep and had to rewind), suffice to say that there are fewer examples of poor editing, dreary pacing, atrocious direction, woeful acting, and diabolical dubbing. Quite how Warren and company managed to mess up in all departments is one of the great mysteries of cinema, ranking right up there with the inexplicable popularity of Seth Rogen, but it has ensured the film a notoriety that means it will never be forgotten.",

You have the Viking battles,good storyline,very good CGI and special effects,with equally complementing soundtrack. The actors have rendered their skills to the best,the screenplay was great and overall the characters are well delivered. The story is of an Outlander from a different planet who ends up in a ship crash on NORSE territory-planet earth!But the ship has brought along an alien trouble-a species called Moorven/Moorwen.Kainan(James Caviezel) is treated as an Outlander,he has to prove his worth and also tell the vikings of the alien trouble he has bought along.And henceforth the plot flows. The Movie has got breathtaking locations,viking costumes,&quot;the shields&quot; game,all was just entertaining.It has abundant gore too,of course its a viking movie after all! Anyways guys its a perfect perfect perfect snack for your pop corns!Rent it or buy it!",

With all the sensibilities ... or lack thereof.\n\nLike his other outputs, this has not aged well. Some of the jokes actually work, most are probably considered offensive by most nowadays. Not sensitive either and predictable to the end (whatever that says on a moral stand point) ... and it seems or rather feels like many if not all of the actors are dubbed. Maybe it was the source material that made it look that way, but it certainly does not help with the enjoying part",

During the times when this movie was good was when it wasn&apos;t trying too hard to explain things. However when the explanations come, the movie becomes a exercise in patronization. Apart from these flaws and a musical number during the first act in the film, this film is pretty good. Sometimes I think these type of movies are made for the purpose of making people feel more intellectual than they really are. Nonlinear mysterious stories such as this one deserve more than what this movie has to offer. This movie had so much potential and in the end I&apos;m left wondering what might of been.",

      "reviewBody": "In case you&apos;re wondering, yes, &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; takes its name as well as its somber mood from the 2001 Leonard Cohen song &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot;. But for Cohen fans, I don&apos;t remember hearing the song in the film, only the lyrics spoken at the beginning and end. So, much like the movie &quot;Starman&quot; which does not have the Bowie song, it&apos;s a bit of a bummer.\n\nIf you can get past that, no problem.\n\nThe film itself is like a blend of &quot;The Lake House&quot;, &quot;The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife&quot; and &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; with maybe a dash of &quot;Angel Heart&quot; with its sexuality and diabolical symbolism. It takes a deliberately fragmented, psueudo-supernatural approach, challenging the viewer like in &quot;The Lake House&quot;. It features a character traveling through time like in &quot;The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife&quot;, and it revolves around a quietly abusive relationship between a man &amp; a woman like in &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;. Throw them all together and mix vigorously with a dash of very nice jazz trumpet music, and there you have &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot;.\n\nIt is NOT a &quot;science fiction&quot; as I&apos;ve read in some places (why do people see &quot;time travel&quot; and immediately think HG Welles and Star Trek??). And it&apos;s definitely not a &quot;romance&quot;, unless your idea of romance includes borderline rape, borderline paedophilia and something even worse which I won&apos;t ruin for you. It&apos;s not a straightforward thriller because there&apos;s not really any terror. So this film is pretty hard to classify except to say that it&apos;s the story of a woman who is trying to fix her past, present and future before it ends in disaster.\n\nBy the way, although I just threw a bunch of spooky themes at you (rape, paedophilia, etc), don&apos;t worry because the film is not explicit or graphic in any way. It implies a lot of things, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any nudity other than Jodie Whittaker&apos;s backside shown through a closet door. This subtle style of filmmaking is prevalent in the whole movie, which means there aren&apos;t a lot of melodramatic clichés or people shouting &amp; breaking things. What&apos;s funny is that the *lack* of action/violence makes the film even more sinister to me.\n\nAnother interesting spin is the way the story is very dreamlike--symbolic and metaphoric rather than realistic--so you don&apos;t get caught up analyzing plot details. For example, the time traveler is never recognized by any of the other characters even though you&apos;d think they would. Also, settings don&apos;t change either, and although some characters age expectedly, others stay the same. It sets an interesting tone, as if telling us (like a dream) that certain appearances are not as important as their meaning.\n\nThis is director Dana Lustig&apos;s latest film credit (as of 2014), and I hope there are many more to come. It is one of the rare thrillers with a female perspective which I (a guy) find so much more provocative than the standard Hollywood thrillers about some dude who&apos;s steamrolling through the story trying to be cool. &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; has just enough enough pauses for reflection while maintaining its momentum. Definitely give this a whirl if you&apos;re looking for a movie that&apos;s pensive yet provocative and certainly different from all the rest.",

The Friday the 13th team (Steve Miner, Sean S. Cunningham, and Harry Manfredini) strikes again.  Even Kane Hodder (Jason) does some stuntwork.  The story and the script are both great thanks to Fred Dekker (The Monster Squad) and Ethan Wiley (House II).  Steve Miner succeeds in creating the atmosphere of an old house and in finding a likable cast as well.  The cast includes William Katt (Carrie) as the unlucky lead Roger Cobb, George Wendt (Normie from Cheers), and Richard Moll (Bull from Night Court).  My favorite cast member is probably the house itself.  It&apos;s perfect, I think they made it just for this movie.  The effects and makeup are great for the eighties.  Skeleton Big Ben is awesome.  One standout scene is Roger and the mini-demons playing tug-a-war with the little boy Robert (Miner&apos;s own kid).  The score, by Manfredini, is highly similar to that of Friday the 13th, but I love still love it.  House is a well put together, underrated horror movie.  If you&apos;re going to buy a house this year, make it this one."

I&apos;m now officially a Jade Leung fan.\n\nThe story is basically &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; with a twist: Leung plays the Mel Gibson part. She plays a no-holds-barred HK cop whose husband was murdered on their wedding night, so she has no fear of death. She&apos;s enlisted to stop an illegal arms smuggling ring by the Singapore police and is teamed up with Honey (Anita Lee)who, at times, steals some scenes from Leung with her own beauty and fighting expertise. Leung tries to woo a young lawyer protecting the evil Gwailo gun smuggler but loses love again in a gun battle and takes the fight in a air-borne helicopter stunt-fest. While sensual in some scenes, the film skirts the Cat III brand because of no graphic nudity, but Leung is enough to fill the screen with her beauty and grace."

      "name": "Enter the Mullet",
      "reviewBody": "Mullet Wars at its best man.  As expressed numerous times, anyone that loves laughing at movies, who appreciates camp value, mullets, bad acting, extremely poorly acted sequences, bad fight scenes, indiscernible plot configurations, and yes THE MULLET, you will love this movie.\n\nEveryone around here is giving such glowing remarks about the camp value of the film maybe its high time we talk about just why this movie is BAD.  If you&apos;re in the mood for an epic adventure action movie, do NOT see this one with hopes of coming out with your testosterone cravings sated.  Such is the curse of bad kung fu movies without genuine kung fu artists.  Why did this movie fail dismally at its objective?  Well I can think of a few reasons off the top of my head.  First off, as alluded to, this is an action-epic type of movie with definite parallels to Enter the Dragon.  Martial Artist chosen by government to go to some isolated little known area of the world to help the United States&apos; cause by outwardly competing in some kind of competition/game.\n\nSo given its obvious reaching for Enter the Dragon memories, you would think Clouse would have made an attempt to grab some good actors, the kind of martial artists that could easily impress the audience with their moves. So who did they get?  All white guys, including an olympic gold medalist in gymnastics, Kurt Thomas.  So where in the martial arts action epic genre some directors sacrifice acting talent and bad english for superb martial arts (Ninja 3: The Domination, a bad movie with some pretty good martial arts), and other directors sacrifice superb martial arts for well spoken english, boyish charms, and great acting ability (David Carradine and Jeff Cooper in Circle of Iron, a must-see if you love martial arts genre whacky movies) Clouse has in this case sacrificed &quot;acting ability&quot; of all variations for bad english and *horrible* martial arts sequences.\n\nWhy else is this movie an utter failure at its objective?  Well, part of the magic of Enter the Dragon was its theme of Shaolin martial arts.  This, especially at the time, was kind of a popular mystical topic that few understood, but most everyone thought was &quot;cool&quot;.  In this way, anything Eastern involving mysticism or fighting is a veritable well of immediate movie value (hence the 80&apos;s ninja craze).  The problem with this movie is it gave the feel of a popular mystic subject without using any of the popular mysticism that gives this type of movie instant entertainment value to movie-goers regardless of accuracy.  The biggest attempt at this might be the name &quot;gymkata&quot; because it sounds kind of Eastern, and the premise of mixing western and eastern styles.  But in actuality this premise is little better than a line in the movie, because there is NOTHING else in the movie to support it.\n\nWhy else?  Bad sequences, choreography, and directing.  When I think about this movie and Enter the Dragon, I can&apos;t help but think that Clouse truly just was not trying with this movie.  Its the only way to explain his complete inept job of directing this movie.  The subplots are bare and underdeveloped.  The premise of the movie surrounds a &quot;game&quot; whose rules and dynamics are completely indescernible, baffling, and plain dumb.  As previously expounded upon, the coincidences in this movie are terrible such as the infamous pommel-horse town of the crazies scene.  My honest guess is that after Kurt Thomas won the gold medal, some money grubbing crazy producer (the kind responsible for making 7th sequels and whatnot) decided to capitalize on gold medal fame by starring a gymnast in a martial arts movie, then proceeding to blackmail Robert Clouse into directing such a film, and Clouse in his attempt to get back at his blackmailer, sabotaged his own film by putting a bunch of bad-acting white guys who can&apos;t fight in a martial arts genre movie, sticking in poorly developed subplots such as the love story between the princess and the gymnast, and overall making a movie that any director would sit back, watch on the big screen, take the ONLY copy of the film, lock it in an iron chest, and bury deep within the earth&apos;s core."

      "reviewBody": "Okay, I&apos;m a Nic Cage fanboy. Let&apos;s get that out of the way. I&apos;ll watch anything the guy does no matter how terrible the reviews are, and sometimes I&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised, as was the case with &quot;Seeking Justice&quot;, &quot;Drive Angry&quot;, and &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;. The guy has some hidden gems in his career. Is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance one of them? Hell no.\n\nThe first Ghost Rider was campy and stupid, but it was a watchable popcorn action movie and it had Eva Mendes (hence, watchable). Spirit of Vengeance is just stupid. Everything about it is stupid. No part of this movie is fleshed out and none of it is interesting. It throws you right into the action with no exposition. It&apos;s just a bunch of things happening on screen oozing with CGI to make up for the complete lack of substance. You can tell this is the same guy that directed Crank: the difference is that movie didn&apos;t need any substance because the premise was so fun. This movie just pisses on Ghost Rider&apos;s origin (literally) and expects you to enjoy watching sh*t blow up for the sake of sh*t blowing up. The writing in this movie is especially horrendous; did they hire a 10 year old to do the screenplay? It sure as hell seems like it.\n\nSo you may be asking yourself, &quot;why give it a 4/10 if it&apos;s so awful?&quot; Well, I&apos;m a sucker for laughably bad movies and this definitely qualifies. I mean, the dialogue alone tries to take itself seriously but ends up providing really good unintentional laughs. But I&apos;ll be fair, not all of this movie sucks.\n\nNicolas Cage is always enjoyable to watch. You can tell he&apos;s invested in the role, and his dedication really holds this movie together. Idris Elba is also in this movie for some reason and he&apos;s great in anything, even if his character is completely throwaway. The other acting is serviceable I guess. You can&apos;t really blame any actors here because it&apos;s obvious the filmmakers wanted it to be a massive CGI-fest with stupid dialogue to lead action sequence A to action sequence B. To their credit, the CGI in this movie is pretty cool. Ghost Rider looks badass, the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at, and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. \n\nSo in a nutshell, you don&apos;t need to see this movie. You really don&apos;t. Not even the great Nicolas Cage is enough to hold this piece of trash together. But if you&apos;re really stoned or just want to see cool sh*t on screen for an hour and a half and there&apos;s literally nothing else to watch, go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. You may find a new B-movie comedy classic.",

The only fault in this movie is the last sketch written by Frederic Dard who has less talent than the previous screenwriters. Anyway, this Gérard Oury gem is Pure French Cinema.\n\nI don&apos;t know if that early Oury&apos;s movie worked, but if not, I suggest distributors to release in a dozen theatres in France this talented Crime Ne Paie Pas, I&apos;m sure it would nicely score and become a new hit by Gérad Oury, even if not a comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I loved this, and not just for the obvious reasons. Blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind Tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of Mount Everest&apos;s sister peaks. Now, this kind of thing is usually a can&apos;t miss. Inspirational. Moving. Pretty standard, right? And even if the film were just that, I&apos;d still have liked it. But it was so much more. Blind herself, German Sabriye Tenberken established a school for blind children in Tibet, in a culture that sees blindness as a curse, as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life. Many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives, and at best, are a burden to their families. As part of their education, Tenberken shares with them the story of American Erik Weihenmayer, the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest. She sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students. Instead, he comes up with a plan. He&apos;ll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23,000 foot Lhakpa Ri and provide all the guides and equipment. Sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts.\n\nErik&apos;s team are mostly American, mostly male, and mostly sighted. As experienced mountaineers, they&apos;re Type-A personalities, very gung-ho and goal-oriented. Sabriye is European, female, and blind, and the students for her are more than a &quot;project,&quot; no matter how well-intentioned. Additionally, the students are Tibetan, and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves. As the expedition unfolds, they become pawns in between the two adult &quot;sides,&quot; wanting to please both, while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment. As an additional obstacle (other than being blind, that is), they are speaking English as a second or in most cases, a third language, and struggle to understand and make themselves understood.\n\nWhen it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience, and that some are much more coordinated than others, it begins to unravel Erik&apos;s original plan for them all to reach the summit together. As both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude, decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain. Among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability, and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults. At the risk of oversimplifying, on one side are those for whom the destination is all, and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey. I won&apos;t tell you how it all turns out, except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought-provoking stories I&apos;ve seen in a long time.\n\nThe film also weaves bits of each climber&apos;s story into the narrative, and this was sorely needed, since once on the climb, the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut. With all the drama going on around them, that wasn&apos;t surprising. The backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking, and I found it very strange that I found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end. This was contrary to my expectations, and another pleasant surprise.\n\nIn addition to all the human drama to cover, director Walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen-deprived conditions herself, lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn&apos;t break down. As with all great documentaries, the filmmaker was just lucky enough (or smart enough, or prepared enough) to be at the right place at the right time, and she&apos;s captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do &quot;what&apos;s best for the kids&quot; as it does about the kids themselves.",

It&apos;s a bright con film about two brothers that are good at what they do since a very young age, but the younger brother wants out. So his older brother convinces him to join him for one last con, with his assistant Bang Bang which fits her quite accurately. This isn&apos;t a serious or one of those dark movies about a con, so in another words it will leave a smile on your face. Plus I sort of cared what happens to the characters since they are mostly likable and has charisma, and found the scenario especially the visual style of this movie to be intriguing. It has a bit of the bromance, but mostly it&apos;s a romantic comedy with smugglers and should not be taken seriously in a good way of course. This movie really does have heart and a sense of adventure. Now I enjoyed Rian Johnson&apos;s past film &quot;Brick&quot; and I enjoyed this one as well, not as cool as &quot;Brick&quot; is, but still enjoyable. Especially how the main con, needs some fake cons to go with it along with it&apos;s witty plot. It isn&apos;t a waste of time or money to see this film. By the end of the film, with it&apos;s great ending I have to give this a...\n\n8.2/10",

      "reviewBody": "Just watched it again yesterday - it&apos;s striking how good the action is compared to the ridiculous dialogue. I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first &quot;let&apos;s make a quick buck&quot; entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn&apos;t treat the material with the respect it deserved. When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It&apos;s hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you&apos;re able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you&apos;re in for a fun ride. My vote: 6.5 out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

Some might say there&apos;s a bit of political themes in this film, but it&apos;s not really propagandist or moralist at all. I recommend this for anyone who loves films like &quot;Kes&quot; by Ken Loach or &quot;Little Fugitive&quot; by Morris Engel.",

And in a complete reversal from his usual light hearted comedy roles, Klaus Kinski protrays a madman getting madder.\n\nIf you liked Agirre or Fitzcaraldo, and would have liked a larger cast including Amazon warrior girls from Africa and National Geo graphic dancing then by all means see this.  Warning: no light hearted romance, cute chimps or talking to the animals here.  Surreal, dark, morality story with great acting and the best one liner in Herzog&apos;s repertoire while watching amazonian spear dancing (are you listening Joe Bob Briggs?)\n\nWho are these women?

      "reviewBody": "What other movie gives you placid scenes of babbling brooks &amp; dragonflies ...then WHACK! someone gets their head blown off ...then ahhh, tranquil mountaintop trees ...then WHACK! someone throws a pig carcass all over the dining room ...then ahh, pretty caterpillar on a leaf... etc, etc, etc.\n\nThis movie is unique, that&apos;s for sure. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe story presents the bipolar life of a gangster&apos;s son. Raised on violence but with a strong inner &quot;goodness&quot;, he is torn between two incompatible worlds. His father is a ruthless criminal who, in his spare time, hunts wild boar as if they&apos;d insulted his mama. His sister (mother figure) is a level-headed, sensitive person who, in her spare time, rescues dogs &amp; kittens from the streets. Eventually our hero hooks up with a bunch of diaper-wearing, drum-beating freaks on a mountaintop, and that&apos;s when things start to happen. I told you this movie is unique.\n\nSome parts are delightfully predictable--almost borderline sappy--but there are some clever plot twists as well. Really, though, this movie shouldn&apos;t be watched for its plot. It&apos;s about the spiritual journey we all face in life, whether or not we hook up with drum-beating freaks. The drums represent a primitive connection with oneself. The drums represent discipline &amp; a return to sanity when we&apos;re bogged down with &quot;too much mind&quot;. As the opening narration indicates, the first sound we ever hear is that of a drumbeat (the rhythm of our mother&apos;s heart), and this forges deep connection with our spirit. There are some very interesting thoughts presented on the subject, and while I was initially skeptical about how smacking a tom-tom could relate to a person&apos;s soul, I was gradually mystified and eventually convinced that there&apos;s something worth pondering.\n\nIf you&apos;re starting to doze off, don&apos;t worry. A few brutal murders, dismembered body parts &amp; pig carcasses ought to wake you up again. This contrasts sharply against the serene mountaintop and calm disposition (not to mention vegetarian meals) of the zen drummers where the kid finds temporary refuge. One reviewer said that the contrast makes the film schizophrenic, and it certainly does, but in a deliberate way. It did strike me as a bit disjoint, though. I was expecting a film with slower pacing to allow us to digest it, but this flick comes at you pretty fast. As a result sometimes it feels like we&apos;re getting two halves of two different movies rather than an integrated whole. To me, this film could&apos;ve easily been an hour longer, but I supposed 113 mins is pretty long for most audiences already.\n\nThe music is very nice, with a soundtrack performed by the great young cellist Trey Lee. And of course there&apos;s the fantastic performance of the &quot;U Theatre&quot; drummers (who play themselves in the film).\n\nOverall, I&apos;d say this film is like a blend of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; &amp; &quot;Scarface&quot; with a dash of &quot;The Bird People of China&quot;. Similar films are: the Korean buddhist/gangster flick &quot;Bittersweet Life&quot;, Takeshi Kitano&apos;s Japanese masterpiece &quot;Fireworks&quot; and an obscure but very enjoyable Vietnamese flick called &quot;Buffalo Boy&quot;. All worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "I was able to see this as part of the recent Autism Cymru conference, and can honestly say that this is one of the best films I have seen for years. It somehow maintains a balance between the drama, the need to establish Weaver&apos;s character without mawkishness or making her a complete freak, and a rite of passage for Rickman&apos;s character. There was no point at which I doubted the authenticity of the character&apos;s experiences. It does help to know something about autism (I am a parent of someone with ASD and parts of this were so true it hurt) but not compulsory, and I would heartily recommend it to dispel some myths! I can&apos;t really tell you more without giving it all away - go and see it! Snow Cake is both poignant and rib-achingly funny in parts.\n\nWe were also fortunate to meet the writer, the director and the autistic woman who &quot;coached&quot; Sigourney Weaver. Absolutely fascinating. I can&apos;t wait for this to be released and will be buying the DVD for friends and family.",

      "name": "Film of a difficult fate",
      "reviewBody": "The fate of the film otherwise, as difficult, can not be called. The film was nominated for the Palm d&apos;Or of the Cannes Film Festival in 1960 and was scheduled to be shown on May 17th. However, literally on the eve of presentation the application for the film in the competition program of the film festival was withdrawn. Although, as we all know, all countries, all film companies and all directors, not to mention actors, are passionately interested in participating in international film festivals. Moreover, such prestigious as Cannes. There are two versions of the explanation of the reasons for such an emergency withdrawal of the application. According to the official, the director of the film, Mikhail Kalatozov, suddenly wanted to fix something in the film, so that by the premiere in the USSR, scheduled for June 27, the film would not have a single flaw. According to the second, unofficial version, the application was withdrawn by the leaders of the USSR State Committee for Cinematography, who suddenly realized that the film shows how the means for socialist industrialization (in the film - diamonds) are sought at the cost of human lives (in the film - of geologists). For me personally, the second version seems to be more plausible. And that&apos;s why. The film is brilliant! Filmed by director Kalatozov and cameraman Sergei Urusevsky, both are triumphants of the Cannes Film Festival in 1958 for the film &quot;The Cranes Are Flying.&quot; Top actors of the then Soviet cinema play in the film: Innokenty Smoktunovsky, Yevgeny Urbansky and incomparable Tatyana Samoilova. The high class of the picture also underlines the fact that literally the next year the film was released on European screens, and a year later - on the screens of US cinemas. But I don&apos;t remember whether this film was shown in the USSR in the 1960s - 1970s. However, human memory is an unreliable tool. Therefore, I turned to Kinopoisk for information on the number of viewers who watched this film in its first year. No such information! About the films that were released on the screens in the same years, for example, &quot;The Ballad of a Soldier,&quot; there is such data. About earlier films, for example, &quot;The Cranes Are Flying&quot; or &quot;True Friends&quot;, etc., there is such information. And about the &quot;Letter Never Sent&quot; - no! What can it say? Either the film was taken off the screen immediately after the premiere, or released in such a limited number of copies that it cites data on the viewing of a Soviet film in the Soviet Union by the number of viewers smaller than, say, in France, to put it mildly, uncomfortable. This is why data is absent. And no more any nomination for any film festival. Although it would seem that the premiere took place, it means that the director eliminated all the flaws. Why not to nominate? Especially since Tatyana Samoilova, after &quot;The Cranes Are Flying,&quot; was in world cinema a star of the first brightness. After the premiere of this film in New York, The New York Times responded - a rare case! - quite a benevolent review, however, without attribution. So, we can assume that this review reflects the opinion of the entire editorial board of the newspaper. Of course, a significant part of the review was dedicated to our great Actress Tatyana Samoilova. But the film itself was addressed very flattering epithets: &quot;FOR sheer photographic pull and intensity, &quot;The Letter That Was Never Sent&quot; is unlike any other Russian film drama in many years, ...a truly rare movie, stark in content and setting, pretentious and obscure at times, but of a marvelous pictorial texture. See this unorthodox Russian movie, hold on (like the determined cast) and we guarantee it will get you.&quot; And therefore it is not at all surprising that Francis Ford Coppola in 1995 funded the restoration and re-rental of this painting in the United States. Perhaps this is due to the fact that of all countries, this film has the highest rating in the United States. Overall, 64% of IMDB and Kinopoisk users around the world gave this film a rating of 8 to 10. Based on the foregoing, the rating of the film according to the FilmGourmand&apos;s version is 7.826. And this low rating is due primarily to the fact that the Soviet leadership at one time prevented the participation of the film in any film festivals and narrowed the scope of the film to the maximum extent possible in cinemas. But, nevertheless, the film is included in the FilmGourmand&apos;s Golden Thousand with Rank 947.",

      "reviewBody": "This bottom of barrel Ravioli Western contains duels , brawls , crossfire and dragging a lot , balancing in ups and downs . The plot summary is plain and simple : a small town is besieged by a brutal band of cutthroats who kill and kidnap , while Sartana appears and takes expedite justice on his hands . Below average Sartana movie, in which various bandits kidnap young Susy : Simonetta Vitelli , niece of the Mayor mayor of Clayton City , Frank Clonny : Franco Rizzi . The reward to free her is 15000 dollars, then Frank delivers the money , and they free her, but the nasty band kidnaps again : a little boy in exchange for another large sum of money . As Sartana : Jeff Cameron , is hired to chase the outlaws.\n\nThis Pasta western packs thrills , go riding , noisy action , shootouts and several scenes with no much sense . It is an inferior Spaghetti Western in very low budget with usual ingredients : violent face off , ordinary zooms , greedy antiheroes and spectacular showdown with abundant crusty faces . Here Sartana thinks a plan which will permit to recover the rewards and take down the outlaws , this Sartana is lousily performed by the blonde Jeff Cameron , a Z-actor with whom director Demofilo Fidani worked in various films. Cameron interpreted in a great number of Spaghettis as a main actor and as a secondary , and he used to utilize varius pseudonyms as Glen Fortes , as he played : Nevada Kid , Sartana ..e vennero in quattro per uccidere Sartana! , Passa Sartana... è l&apos;ombra della tua morte , Straniero... fatti il segno della croce! , Prega Dio... e scavati la fossa! , Django cut price corpses , Strange say your prayers , among others.\n\nThe picture was badly directed by Demofilo Fidani or Miles Deem, deemed to be the Ed Wood of Spaghetti Western and husband of Mila Vitelli, a costume designer and mother of actress Simonetta Vitelli , both of whom worked in several films directed by Fidani . Demofilo made films of all kinds of genres in short budget and exploitation pictures. He eventually had more pseudonyms that any working director in the world, similar to Bruno Mattei and Jess Frank. Fidani wrote and directed adventure : ¨Karzan jungle lord¨ , Thriller : ¨La legge de la Camorra¨, Sex comedy : ¨La professoressa di lingue¨, Giallo : ¨Masseusse good-looking offers her services¨, and Western : ¨Arrivano Django e Sartana¨, ¨Django e Sartana all ultimo sangue¨, ¨Passa Sartana¨, ¨Nevada Kid¨, ¨Django story¨, ¨Giu testa... Hombre¨, ¨Era Sam Wallash!¨.\n\nOther Sartana movies are as follows : The first Sartana was ¨Gunfighters Die Harder&quot; or &quot;If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death&quot; a trend-setting film by Gianfranco Parolini with Gianni Garco , Klaus Kinski and Fernando Sancho . The best Sartana are directed by Giuliano Carmineo , alias Anthony Ascott, he realized various with George Hilton who replaces to Gianni Garco or Gary Hudson . George Hilton played more natural and roguish than Garco who was cold and peculiar . The later &quot;Sartana&quot; movies directed by Anthony Ascott became increasingly cartoonish and humorous . It was followed by director Alfonso Balcazar with ¨Sartana non Perdona or Sonora¨ with George Martin , Jack Elam and Gilbert Roland . And ¨Sartana in the valley of death¨ by Roberto Mauri with William Berger as Sartana . Miles Deem directed four Sartanas deemed awful , lousy and cheesy . Furthermore , a string of sequels and rip-offs with other Z-series directors . Rating 3/10 inferior and embarassing Spaghetti Western. This is exclusively for Spaghetti Westerns hardcore fans.",

      "reviewBody": "You know, Grease 2 has taken a lot of flack &amp; extensive bad reviews for not living up to the original. I really don&apos;t think that is to fair considering the cast was totally different. Granted there was no super-star-pop-icon like Olivia Newton-John. There wasn&apos;t the hot-70&apos;s &amp; 80&apos;s actor John Travolta. However, there were some great stars in this film. The writing may have been a little less than perfect...the direction might not have been up to par. But for me, being EXTREMLY young when both Grease 1 &amp; 2 came out, I never compared the two. I think they are two different films with the same &quot;type&quot; of concept. The music was good. The dance scenes are good. &amp; yes, even the story is okay. Grease mania is about being a devoted fan... that is something I am. I liked both of these films on two different levels. Grease without a doubt is the better of the two. But this one is not as bad as the negativity everyone feeds into it. If see one, see the other. Just note that they are both FUN movies! Nothing more. The sequel centers around Sandy&apos;s cousin Michael. He is in love with Stephanie, &amp; trys EVERYTHING possible to win her over. The Pink Ladies are still cooler than ever. The T-Birds are not as tuff, but are sexy! 1-10 Grease(10) Grease2(8) Z."

Very intense she tells stories from the beginning of here career until the end...when she is typing Hitler&apos;s both political and private will.\n\nWe should thank André Heller and Othmar Schmiderer for making this great documentary, which came right on time because one day after the release of the movie, Traudl Junge died of cancer.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d been wanting to see SERPICO for some time; this real-life crime drama based on Peter Maas&apos; nonfiction bestseller about an honest cop fighting corruption in the NYPD was one of the few grim-and-gritty New York crime dramas that my older brother didn&apos;t take me to see when I was a kid! :-) (I should explain that my brother, 9 years my senior, used to take me to the kind of movies he wanted to see -- films like TAXI DRIVER, REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER, etc. Fortunately, I developed a taste for them as well, though our mother didn&apos;t think they were really appropriate for a girl as young as I was then. :-) No wonder this film helped young Al Pacino&apos;s then-rising star (he was fresh off THE GODFATHER when he began filming SERPICO) to soar to the stratosphere, complete with an Oscar nomination. Pacino&apos;s earnest intensity fuses Frank Serpico&apos;s disparate qualities into a spellbinding performance. The guy is a bundle of contradictions, the kind of man who could charm you, move you, and drive you crazy at the same time: a nice Catholic boy who can&apos;t commit to any of the devoted women in his life; an honest, downright rigid moralist who&apos;s also a free spirit known as &quot;Paco&quot; to his friends and lovers; and an undercover cop with detective aspirations whose hippie-like appearance rankled his superiors and fellow officers even as it helped him blend in on assignments. Pacino&apos;s riveting performance carries the film, with fine support by John Randolph, Tony Roberts, M. Emmet Walsh, Barbara eda-Young and Cornelia Sharpe, not to mention memorable uncredited turns by F. Murray Abraham, Judd Hirsch, Kenneth McMillan, and Tony LoBianco, among others. Sidney Lumet&apos;s taut direction of the script by Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler does Maas&apos; source material proud, as well as taking advantage of evocative NYC locations (just try getting this kind of atmosphere in Canada, I dare you! :-). The sparing use of simple yet haunting music by Mikis Theodorakis sets the tone well. The end result: one of the best films of the 1970s and beyond. Rent the DVD to see some fascinating extras about the making of the film and the filmmakers&apos; experiences with Frank Serpico himself, including interviews with Lumet and producer Martin Bregman (no Pacino, alas).",

It reveals however quite a lot of that period, released after the win of Mitterrand and the left for the first time after WWII, the optimism and idealism that were again possible.",

There is a female lead as one of the captives who, though not dressed sexy, is somehow incredibly hot. Moore is particularly entertaining as a curmudgeon of a man who openly dislikes women, loves cats, Scottish booze, and needlepoint. The movie builds steadily, keeping tension throughout while retaining a strong sense of humor."

      "reviewBody": "Forty years on and `Viridiana&apos; is one of the very few, almost unique, examples of classical Spanish cinema to have survived the turmoil of the latter half of the last century. It remains as a little light in the midst of the darkness of the Franco Régime, which promptly banned it, or as an insouciance to the Vatican, which promptly excomulgated everyone concerned with it.\n\nBuñuel&apos;s genius is apparent in every frame: the eye for detail, nonetheless permitting that impromptu evanesqueness which lends exquisiteness to these memorable scenes, above which shines the `Last Supper&apos;. And it is precisely this scene which gives one the impression that the real stars in the making of this film were the motley beggars taken in from the streets. Silvia Pinal and Francisco `Paco&apos; Rabal are not outstanding in this piece; even the incomparable Fernando Rey is overshadowed by the band of social outcasts. The sheer poeticness so brilliantly captured by the camera roaming among the vagabonds is cinematographic exquisiteness carried to its extreme: every grimace, every wrinkled nose, the debauchery, is what makes the principal actors be no such thing, but secondary actors overwhelmed by the nuances and gestures of these `untouchables&quot;. Brilliant filming, indeed  whether intentional or not or whether this be only my personal interpretation after seeing this film three times in the last twenty five years, is of course open to debate. \n\nSuffice just to mention Lola Gaos: (Tristana (1970)  also by Buñuel - is one of her other films worthy of mention, surprisingly accepted by the censor&apos;s blue pen). In the 70s her voice began to break up, such that in the end she lived out her last years in poverty, forgotten by the times and cinema makers, until hauled out of hiding for a last TV appearance, sardonic way of giving her a few pennies to eke out to the end of her existence, but by then  (1989) her voice was so fragmented it was near impossible to understand her. Her throat-cancer was never treated adequately.\n\n Luis Buñuel (`Thank God I am an atheist&apos;) has gone; Fernando Rey has gone; Paco Rabal died yesterday in an aeroplane flying over the English Channel, returning from the Montreal Film Festival where he received his last award.\n\nThey leave `Viridiana&apos; as testament to those historical and difficult times, an isolated exposé amid what was, for Spain, a cinematographical desert.",

      "reviewBody": "In the Nineteenth Century, in London, the barber Sweeney Todd (Tod Slaughter) invites lonely and wealthy costumers in the port to his barbershop on the nearby Fleet Street and murders them to take their money, while his associate Mrs. Lovatt (Stella Rho) and owner of a bakery below is barbershop gets rid off the bodies. Sweeney uses his fortune to help the fleet owner Stephen Oakley (D.J. Williams) with the intention to force his daughter Joanna (Eve Lister) to marry him. However, the beloved Joanna&apos;s boyfriend Mark Ingerstreet (Bruce Seton) returns rich from his last voyage and Sweeney decides to kill him and steal his fortune in pearl, making Mrs. Lovatt jealous with the situation.\n\nThe original &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; is a dark and macabre tale of greedy. It is funny to see only insinuation of cannibalism and that Mrs. Lovatt is the lover of Sweeney Todd. Pearly questioning how Sweeney Todd gets rid off the bodies of his victims while eating one of Mrs. Lovatt&apos;s pies is hilarious. Tod Slaughter performs a great villain, but the conclusion with Sweeney returning to the barbershop on fire to be defeated by Mark is weak. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Diabólico Barbeiro de Londres&quot; (&quot;The Diabolic Barber of London&quot;)",

It&apos;s always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that&apos;s exactly what happened! I&apos;ve always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn&apos;t a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL&apos;s throughout the movie! To me, it&apos;s one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don&apos;t walk out of there thinking you&apos;d wasted your time and intellect!) - it&apos;s one of those movies that i&apos;ll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!",

It gets big points for originality by reviving the old days of 70s &quot;truckin&apos; man&quot; flicks and updating the genre into a sci-fi visual feast that compares closely to STARSHIP TROOPERS! Imagine if Bo and Luke Duke were flying around in their orange coaster without jumping over obstacles, and avoiding capture by Sheriff Roscoe! There has to be a good sense of fantasy surrounding this old fad. Well, I&apos;m not gonna get all hyped up about SPACE TRUCKERS, which is mainly your regular dosage of outer space mayhem. The simple action looks as good as the rich visual quality, but don&apos;t take it too hard. It plunges into the offbeat stage, and loses its sci-fi luster to some needless &quot;hot&quot; sexuality (added by the lack of gravity), and a captivity scene. I can tell that the minds of script writers skirted around the explicit subject matter, just to prevent any further boiling on the offensive side. You know, the two lovebirds running and floating around in their undies. And could it be that there are two different endings? Campy as it will sound, there is reason to have fun with it after all.

      "reviewBody": "I deliberately try and opt for a bad movie sometimes, just so that I can rag on it (I find doing so quite therapeutic), and Specimen bore all the hallmarks of a real stinker: a no-name TV director, Saved by the Bell&apos;s Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) in the lead, a dreadful DVD cover bearing the lousy tag-line &apos;Be very quiet... They might want you...&apos;. But although the film is definitely a cheap piece of derivative cheeze, a mish-mash of ideas stolen from &apos;Firestarter&apos;, &apos;The Terminator&apos; and a whole handful of other sci-fi films, it still managed to be slightly more fun than I had expected.\n\nThe film begins with a pre-credits sequence in which a young boy, Mike, somehow unwittingly causes fires in his sleep, resulting in the accidental death of his mother. That boy grows up to be Gosselaar, who—after the death of his grandmother—finds a box of his mother&apos;s belongings which leads him to her hometown in search of the identity of his father, and an answer to his uncontrollable pyrokinesis. All of this is handled pretty well by director John Bradshaw, and Gosselaar is actually decent; at this point, Specimen is shaping up to be a surprisingly classy flick.\n\nAnd then &apos;The Terminator&apos; arrives—or rather Eleven, an extraterrestrial in human guise (played by Doug O&apos;Keefe, doing his best Schwarzeneggar), arrives—and the film becomes an unintentionally laughable mess. Eleven&apos;s mission is to find and destroy Mike, who is an alien/human hybrid, the result of his mother being abducted and impregnated by scientists from another world (and who can blame the naughty ETs? Mike&apos;s mother is played by the very probe-worthy Carmelina Lamanna, who flashes full-frontal during some flash-backs), but is thwarted by another alien named Sixty-six who happens to be Mike&apos;s father!\n\nMatters get progressively sillier here on in, with the two aliens battling it out with each other while Mike tries to come to terms with his bizarre lineage and the fact that he might not be able to get it on with new girlfriend without causing her third degree burns. Expect a lot of pyrotechnics, a Terminator-style synth score, plenty of dreadful dialogue, no explanation as to why Eleven wants Mike dead, and an open ending that makes one wonder whether this was intended as a pilot for a TV series that (not surprisingly) never happened.",

Part of the reason that the characters were so outrageously stereotypical is because the real people on which they were based were themselves screaming queens - and, last I checked, there&apos;s nothing wrong with that.  These were people who celebrated who they were - everyone else&apos;s opinions of them be damned.  Moreover, their differences were what brought them together to win the championship, defy the odds, and defy perceptions of what they *should* be like.  It puzzles me that other readers focus on the &quot;negativity&quot; of their behavior, when the story is about acceptance, fighting ignorance, and celebrating the differences in us all.",

There&apos;s nothing preachy or political here, director John Irvin and writer James Carabatsos approach the subject with a refreshing humane honesty, making us viewers privy to the American soldiers mindset as they cope with life in Vietnam before an assault on some turd pile strategic hill, a battle that the survivors of that particular bloody conflict would call Hamburger Hill.\n\nNo matter what one feels about the war, the politics of such etc, the fact that quite often Vietnam films zoom in on the misdemeanours and egotistical sides of the American presence in Vietnam, tends to detract from the bravery of men and boys who were doing the job their government decreed they should do. Hamburger Hill addresses this, proudly so. Pace is deliberate and literate, building up to the assault on Hill 937, with little slices of kinetic action inserted along the way to tantalise and torment in equal measure.\n\nNot all the acting is smart, there&apos;s a cast of up and coming thesps on show that features some who have gone on to be &quot;name&quot; actors, while others that were out of their depth subsequently found a level more befitting their abilities. Yet this is also a cunning tactic in the film&apos;s favour, no stars needed here, young adult actors without baggage or headlines kind of feels appropriate for this portrayal of soldiers in an alien world, many of whom would lay their shattered bodies down in the mud at Hamburger Hill. 8/10",

The real heart of the movie is in the way Coach Carter begins to turn the lives around of the players on his basketball team by showing them that someone actually cares about what happens to them after high school.\n\nAt one point in the movie Carter (played perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson) asks a player why he plays basketball and he responds with &quot;to win the state title&quot; - which of course gets him high fives from the rest of the team. Carter then asks the team who won the state title last year and nobody knows the answer. Carter tries to show his players that high school basketball is not about winning but about discipline, respect and the confidence to accomplish any goal.\n\nIf you are thinking about going to see Coach Carter as a basketball movie, I suggest seeing another movie, but if you want to see a truly inspiring story go see Coach Carter."

True, some of the dialogue in this movie borders on juvenile, but overall I rate the movie very high.",

      "reviewBody": "A pickpocket (Richard Widmark) steals a woman&apos;s wallet on the subway (Jean Peters), but unknown to both of them, it contains top secret American information that was going to be delivered to the Russians. A well connected woman in the underworld (Thelma Ritter) helps the police, the woman, and the pickpocket at various points along the way, but she draws the line at helping communists.\n\nThe strength of this film for me came in its cast. Widmark is great in his sneering defiance of the police, and in both seducing and dominating Peters when she seeks him out. Thelma Ritter is great as always, and the scene that starts with her playing Mam&apos;selle on the phonograph next to her bed is excellent. Peters has several fine moments, and the one where she&apos;s abused by her handler (Richard Kiley) is intense. The film also moves along efficiently and briskly at 80 minutes, which I liked. Oh, and that shot in the dumb waiter that director (and writer) Sam Fuller gives us! Brilliant.\n\nThe weakness is in its implausible actions, most notably just how quickly Peters falls for Widmark, even though that scene where he strokes her face before kissing her is pretty steamy. Maybe it&apos;s just a little too brisk for its own good. The whole communist crew seem remarkably weak given the importance of the information. There are other things as well, starting from why she&apos;s on the subway to begin with and running all the way through to a ridiculous ending (no doubt in there because of the Production Code), but it gets a little tedious to pick a movie like this apart. You have to enjoy it for what it is, and it&apos;s pretty entertaining. Like a lot of noir films, there is a certain baseline level of misogyny though, in this case with Peters either being knocked around or kissed.\n\nI didn&apos;t care for the communist scare aspect of the film, and how much this affected the characters (look, even crooks hate commies!), however, I have to give Fuller and studio exec Darryl F. Zanuck credit for standing up to J. Edgar Hoover when he tried to get changes made. I&apos;m not sure this quite lives up to the reputation of being a classic, but watch it for the performances, and its atmosphere.",

      "reviewBody": "Struggling to find work after college, a woman agrees to take a position at a hotel managed by a friend of a friend while the area is being protected from a deadly plague, and as she works there she becomes convinced a curse involving a figure living in a specific room and must keep herself safe as a result.\n\nThere was quite a lot to like with this one. Among its better qualities is how the film keeps the central mystery of the room hidden for the most part throughout here. The way everyone keeps their distance regarding the cursed room in the hotel, from ensuring her daughter doesn&apos;t enter it accidentally to the quiet uttering of the curse placed on it by the witch from local legend and the strange incidents that take place in the hotel around the room while she&apos;s working there manage to build a solid and engrossing mystery about the area. Likewise, once it turns that build-up into unleashing the supernatural there&apos;s quite a lot to like here. With the slow-burn build starting with the employee getting sick exactly like she described in the legend involving the witch to the continuous noises and objects disappearing and moving around on her, there&apos;s an eerie tone working throughout here that is quite effective. Rather than going full bore with needless jump-scares of ghosts crawling all over the hotel, the fact that this one goes for the subtle route of obviously featuring a secret harbored by the crew but are unable to reveal it, which is a fine and far more enjoyable substitute with the atmospheric approach instead. The other enjoyable aspect here is the fun finale where it takes the build-up and offers some solid payoffs. The attack on the poisoned worker in her room is a chilling start, as are the later encounters down in the laundry room and the maid&apos;s confrontation with the possessed figure crawling through the main lobby which generates the best hints that something&apos;s wrong. As this spills into the other hotel members having their confrontations with the vengeful being, there&apos;s quite a lot to like here with the action picking up nicely and generating some thrilling scenes as the race to quell her fury results in some fun encounters as well with the rituals required to calm here alongside the fine action taking place in the hotel and the witches&apos; realm. These here are what works overall as this one does have some slight problems. The main issue for some here will be the idea that the subtle, slow-burn buildup throughout the first hour will cause this one to be drawn-out far longer than necessary. Instead of taking the direct route of the occupant of the room and how it all ties together with the legend, the mysterious nature of it all means this one takes its time to build these events which can take its toll on some viewers. The other flaw here is some rather wonky and obvious effects-work that weakens some of the scenes they&apos;re in, from CGI flames to unnatural body distortions and other visual flares that are supposedly done for effect but look cheap as a result. With a finale that goes on a little too long but otherwise, there isn&apos;t a whole lot wrong with this one.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",

      "reviewBody": "I should begin by stating that I LOVE this film, which may explain, if not justify the following comments.\n\nThis is an excellent exploration of the human mind in a fantastic situation, but more simply just a damn good science fiction thriller.\n\nI would agree that the first half is the better part, but to those who criticise the second half as being cliched and unstructured I would argue that a new impetus is needed by the time Zac has lived out his various fantasies and flirted with insanity.\n\nWhere many appear to feel the film is confused and leaves many matters unresolved, that very ambiguity and bewilderment was what I enjoyed most. For most of the film you DON&apos;T know where the characters have found themselves, whether they are actually alive or dead, or what reality they&apos;re living in.\n\nIn accordance with this fascination I found the ending superb, accompanied as it was by that haunting theme music. Maybe it came as a result of the writer not knowing how to end the thing but it was never going to be a film where everything fell into place by a few cunningly worded lines at the conclusion! Therefore I liked the fact things were left unexplained, unsatisfying though it may be.\n\nIn short, I would definitely recommend this film, which seems to be dusted off and screened late at night on a regular basis by BBC 2 (English terrestrial channel). I know it won&apos;t appeal to everyone, but there will be those surrealists who do love it, if only as a fun and bizarre Sci-fi.",

While the German army is gaining ground in the North of France, four boys aged 10 to 15, Lucien, Lucas, Luigi and Ludwig are left behind during the evacuation of their orphanage, but they realize that must not be prepared to flee. The characters are: Ludwig (Leonard Fauquet) is a timid intellectual and an avid reader of Jules Verne&apos;s novels - especially the one his mother left him with as a parting gift; he soon gets the support of Francois Damiens, in a serious role as the Abbot, and a schoolmaster who is then forced to leave for the front. Lucas (Tom Castaing) is hardly out of nappies when he finds himself far away from home. Luigi (Mathys Gros) is the strongest boy, and pre-teen Lucien (Loup Picard) will soon discover the tender pleasures of first love when Luce ( Labeaut) appears on the scene, as the only young girl who&apos;s separated from her parents. Along the way, they meet a feisty farmer&apos;s wife (Isabelle Carre) who gradually takes on the role of the boy&apos;s matron. Soon joined by other roles, they decide to reach the neutral country of Switzerland by all means possible. At first it seems like a not too difficult path, but then the journey becomes bumpy and ends abruptly. Getting away the village, the boys run into a German soldier called Hans who has defected from the army and hopes to join his wife back home. Hans befriends the boys and teaches them German. But dark clouds soon loom when Hans (Schiltz) tries to take them all across the border to safety in Switzerland. They embark on an adventure for which nothing has prepared them, while some good people help them achieve the desired freedom.\n\nIn Yann Samuell&apos;s well-paced drama there&apos;s an interesting studio character, this is a passionate and emotional film dealing with for boys are left behind during the evacuation of their orphanage and then the &apos;Boches&apos; (Germans) appear with consequent turmoil, confusion and danger. The journey becomes increasingly dangerous and exhausting, forcing them to depend on other escaped people.\n\nFilmed in studio Babelsberg with some splendid visuals thanks to cameraman Vincent Gallot and stunningly shot on location in Bois-l&apos;Évêque, Seine-Maritime, Guise, Aisne, Saint-Michel, Aisne, Sissonne, Aisne, Ors, Nord, France. And driven forward by Mathieu Lamboley&apos;s terrific original soundtrack. There are some notable interpretations from a cast so young, particularly Didier Fauquet as Ludwig, and adults as the nutty wife Isabelle Carré and Luc Schiltz as brave German Hans . La Guerre des Lulus, is a wonderfully impressive movie that navigates some dramatic highs and lows. Samuell shows how kids, unlike adults, can often often trust and connect across barriers, untainted by prejudice or dogma. And that some adults: here a teacher, a soldier, a mother, and a maverick, can really inspire young people to greatness by mentoring and supportive companionship.\n\nFamily films certainly have the task of preparing serious and stressful themes in such a way that children and young people do not suffer any psychological damage, but this &quot;War of the Lulus&quot; (2022) sometimes almost feels like a crazy comedy for children. However, the threat and seriousness of a situation can still be conveyed, something that is done even in children&apos;s series. Small actors make a decisive contribution to the feel-good factor suitable for the mainstream. The kiddies resort to very childish interpretive means that fit them like a glove. With their ingenuity, precocious charm, sympathy, and stubborn daydreaming, the children achieve a comedic screen presence that shines even brighter in contrast to the harsh realism of the war environment.\n\nResulting to be a sensitive and adventure film about a group of kids who flee through France, to Switzerland. Of course, such a delicate and childish approach to the sexes is always nice to see, but even here there are exaggerations in some scenes , that&apos;s why the children seem to have fun, at times, which gives the whole thing a kind of country holiday atmosphere, however we are dealing with much more serious things.\n\nJokes, fantasies, diversion, and funny sayings among children are followed by drama, pursuit, or danger, and vice versa, changing rapidly and in constant succession. This allows screenwriter/director Yann samuell to tell the adventurous stories with interest and action enough, in his fictional adaptation of comic books by Hardoc and Régis Hautière. On the one hand, the adventure story typical of children&apos;s cinema, animated by the fun thay have throughout depeloped in a slight style. On the other hand, the film adequately reflects the universal destiny of all displaced people at all times and in all places, showing it in a concrete tough experience.\n\nThe motion picture was well written/directed by Yann Samuell. He stated: ¨I don&apos;t like films with a message at the end telling an audience, this is what you have to think. It&apos;s not up to me to have to decide for the audience¨. Yan Samuell was a storyboard artist and writer and director, making some fine films , such as: Le fantôme de Canterville , My sassy girl, L&apos;âge de raison, Grand Hotel, Saving Lisa, The great ghost race, Jeux d&apos;enfants and another succesful kiddies film: War of the buttons . La guerre des Lulus (2022) rating. 6.5/10. Better than average.\n\n.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched the trilogy by Mamoru Oshii. The words surreal, Orwellian and Kafkaesque come to mind. However, despite all their bizarre aspects I believe they are essentially jokes. The darkness was there as a chiaroscuro backdrop to highlight the humor. The first, Red Spectacles, is about a man who can not let go of his past not matter how painful and dangerous it was because he never felt more alive that when he was facing death. The second, Stray Dog, shows that man during an interim period when he seems to be almost at peace, being brought back to that death-seeking modus operandi which precipitates the events of the first film. The third film, Talking Head, while not directly related to the events of the first two, does refer back to them as a man attempts to create truth out of illusion. The idea is that film, as an art form, is essentially an exercise in madness and that illusion is finally a higher truth, an idea that was touched on in the first film. But it is the humor that is Oshii&apos;s ultimate goal. He doesn&apos;t want to make highly significant pronouncements on the nature of humanity and reality. He just wants to tell a story, and if the story is funny, all the better. I suppose that many parallels could be drawn between Oshii&apos;s work and that of Philip K. Dick.",

She struggles to get her life together and finds a job in the most unlikely place, a nerd store. There she finds new friends and journeys along side them with the power of imagination and RPG.\n\nWhat is really brilliant about the story is that her &quot;real life&quot; was perhaps more of a fantasy then the RPG. Its an excellent mix of drama, comedy and adventure. Although the picture is graphic at times it still leaves a lot to your imagination which I really love.\n\nA movie for everyone and I think anyone can relate to it.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sea Biscuit&quot; is a story about a long shot horse and a man who discover each other on the road to equestrian glory. An extremely rewarding journey though the lives of man and beast. Every aspect of human emotion, bonding and courage is explored with an &quot;equine&quot; tinge. Set in a time when horse racing is more passion than business, Seabiscuit glorifies the positive appeal of horse racing. Every derby event is an emotional doorway which lifts your spirits. Be it the Santa Anita or the Pimilco, you are just just hanging on the edge of your seat praying, vying and hoping for a Seabiscuit win. Such is the emotional grasp and visual brilliance of Gary Ross&apos;s direction and Scwartzman&apos;s cinematography. Being a thoroughbred race horse by birth, Seabiscuit treads the race track under the watchful eyes of trainer Tom Smith (played by Chris Cooper) and jockey Red Poddard (played by Tobey Mcguire). What follows is a sequence of predictable vicissitudes. Why! This movie wasn&apos;t advertised in the mystery genre either! \n\nA frail looking (really) Tobey manages to deeply bond with the horse at least on screen, kudos indeed. Nobody else could have possibly fit into his role as well as he did, physically too. Chris Cooper is the silent marvel. There is a completely subtle tinge to his acting which lays low, yet beautifully exuberates class. Seabiscuit is simply one of those &quot;silent&apos; movies which just hurtles you beyond imaginable frontiers. Sit back and relax and let the long shot consume you.",

      "reviewBody": "After his mother&apos;s death, Christian moves once again, and starts in a new school. He meets Elias, and defends him against bullies. The latter&apos;s father works as a doctor in Africa, with a sadistic crime lord nearby. And so we have the setting for a drama exploring revenge, as well as power struggles, loss and fear. The overall moral isn&apos;t going to surprise anyone(and it isn&apos;t entirely consistent), and this does occasionally stoop to a cliché. However, it remains a gripping and effective film, and it manages to interject a lot of insight and truth, seeing situations from multiple different perspectives. This is the second movie by Bier that I watch, and I am confirmed in my assertion that Things We Lost in The Fire was a fluke, and not representative of her level of talent(it should be noted that the main problem with that one was the script, and she had nothing to do with that). She abandons the eyeball shots, and there is much rejoicing. The camera is close at times, though no longer oppressively so. This has a cinematography similar to the show NCIS, with hand-held cameras. I didn&apos;t feel like the nature footage added anything, at least not that of Denmark. The editing puts you right there, without being annoying or particularly drawing attention to itself. This is written by the man behind Den Du Frygter, Mørke and Blinkende Lygter(and other famous ones, but those are the ones I&apos;ve seen and liked), and his skill and credible, human characters(that are the focus) shines through. Everything is set up, and most of it pays off. The acting is excellent, without exception, the kids especially. Our half-way orphaned lead captures every look and movement to perfection, and they really did find someone who could be Thomsen&apos;s son. Bodnia returns to a typecast role for him, and delivers. The vast majority of the humor works, and nearly none of it detracts from the serious and important subject. Everyone can recognize the little brother in someone they do or have known. The music is appropriate and not distracting. Dialog is great. No soap opera moments, it all comes across as entirely genuine, and nothing comes out of the blue. The tone is mature and honest; we don&apos;t feel preached to, or lectured, this respects its audience and honestly understands what it has to say, it isn&apos;t merely repeating a mantra. There is gore(think ER) and disturbing content in this. I recommend it to anyone that this at all appeals to. 8/10",

Faroun films is a Rock Demers distribution company he created in 1965 and wich distributed La Clé d&apos;or in Quebec TV at the time. Rock Demers created then films La Fête,  and together with other european film makers produced quite a big series of &apos;contes pour tous&apos;, still classics in Quebec (La guerre des Tuques, Opération beurre de pinottes, Aventuriers timbre perdu, etc....\n\nBut this here movie was made in 68 in romania... and has the european coloration of fairy-tales produced at the time by Alexander Rou, and other russian and czech producers... It&apos;s is a great tale about the Truth and the PureHeart always winning over the King of Liars, and all that is against us in life : Time, Nature, etc... The sets are just artificial enough for a fantasy...that&apos;s what so good about these movies, no big fuss about special effects and all...\n\nthe overall impression is just a litte 60&apos;s-kitsch tone with a very good scenario and great casting and makeup : ahhh the witch is so....a witch!!!\n\na mustsee musthave movie....but very hard to find i would think"

On the advice of someone on the internet, I gave it a shot, and what a surprise! Although it&apos;ll never be one of my favorite films, it&apos;s certainly worthwhile, a highly engrossing (albeit graphically gory) trip through a wide and shifting range of emotions.  Quinn gives his best performance since &quot;Zorba,&quot; and Costner and Stowe are extremely good. The photography is extraordinary, and Mexican music has seldom been used so effectively.  I&apos;d recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach.  The love scenes, by the way, are romantic AND sexy, a rare combination.",

All of the actors are wonderful and capturing the nuances of their characters. Sarah Polley does it again. The story, set in Toronto, captures the everyday life of Margot and Lou--and depicts their special relationship through the details of their special ways of communicating. It is not until the complexities of Margot&apos;s struggle between her love for Lou and her unyielding attraction to her neighbour, that you start to feel her personal struggle. The inevitable ending does not disappoint. Highly recommended.",

He accompanies Princess Carissa (Carla Herd) and her big diamond in quest for a matching stone. She&apos;s killed and he finds her twin Princess Elezena (also Herd) and eventually to matching gems, for chintzy visual effects when the powerful diamonds are joined.\n\nHerd is upstaged by a pretty Amazonian warrior played by Claudia Inchaurregui, as well as Concorde regular Terri Treas as a villainess with arch dialog readings. Nelson&apos;s all-American approach is way out of place and supporting cast is weak. Previous pics in this series had some campy material but this one&apos;s a stiff."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is better with each passing year. It is a semi-noir, pre-&quot;reality&quot; - psychological drama of intense beauty.\n\n Clark Gable stars as a staunchly confirmed sea dog, crew leader (called a bos&apos;n) and womanizer who is totally unprepared to meet Greer Garson&apos;s character, who forever changes his vision of what is possible in finding love with a woman. Academy Award winner, and beloved character actor Thomas Mitchell (&quot;Uncle Billy&quot; in &quot;It&apos;s A Wonderful Life (1946)&quot;) plays his too-sensitive-for-this-world side-kick, who becomes Gable&apos;s conscience, but at a price.\n\nThe script of this drama is lyrically sublime, subtle and quite deep. The fire between the stars is evident and haunting. True &apos;soul-mate&apos; love is the overt theme of this movie. Existence, conscience, and facing the pain and limits of life, so that you may truly pass into adulthood, are more themes explored here. I view this film regularly once a year and am always inspired by its deep message and raw powerful performances. This isn&apos;t your stock Gable. This is a bittersweet post-war love poem.(Really! E. B. Browning is quoted to great effect!)\n\nGable&apos;s &quot;Harry Patterson&quot; has seen tragedy and loss (as had Gable himself, recently losing the love of his life, wife Carole Lombard). He is made restless in search of &quot;it&quot; which he believes only exists in the danger and perils of sea voyaging. He is sickened by the way shipwrecked people, alive and on edge, once rescued, quickly become bored and lose that passionate awareness of their own lives. He is searching for that life where he stays excited and in the passionate present (probably true of many returning war soldiers in 1945).\n\nIn Garson&apos;s &quot;Emily Sears&quot; he sees &quot;it&quot; for the first time in a woman&apos;s eyes. He is intrigued by her equivalent strength and wit, and simultaneously threatened by the risk of pain in losing her. Their love develops as a series of intense battles. She sees a &quot;caged animal&quot; and for the first time a man she might really respect, even though she feels he needs to be reached through all of his rebellion...and rescued.\n\nHis actions are escapist (and make great movie scenes)...but sailing away to forget his new &quot;queen,&quot; he finds things have changed and we know, as do the other characters, that it is the end of his former life ...even if he doesn&apos;t. &quot;Emily&quot; bravely allows &quot;Harry&quot; to figure it out for himself. She doesn&apos;t demand any change in him, instead she sends him off to find &quot;it&quot; and risks being without the man that she loves for the rest of her life. Her majesty the queen of MGM, Greer Garson, has never been lovelier.\n\n Joan Blondel is a juicy, ripe &apos;tomato&apos;(the returning soldiers must have hooted and hollered!). Lina Romay makes an incredible &quot;girl in distant port&quot; and even sings a bit!\n\nThomas Mitchell is the stand out support. He plays Mudge, the soul and conscience of the free spirited Gable and perhaps of the whole film. He brilliantly helps unite a lost sailor &amp; seeker with what his heart truly seeks.\n\nWatch this film and let it be poetry... just let it play as you marvel at the writing and the actors&apos; eyes. I predict that this movie is about to be rediscovered in a big way. ( By you?)"

      "reviewBody": "Matchstick Men tells the story of con artist Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) and his protégé Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). The status quo of their work is disrupted when Angela (Alison Lohman), the daughter that Roy never knew he had, bumps into his life.\n\nCage&apos;s performance as Roy is definitely the reason why you would want to watch this movie. He got very into character, a con artist with unique psychological traits where agoraphobia and OCD do not cover it all. Throughout the movie it&apos;s impossible not to feel for Roy when his eye twitches or whenever he has a nervous breakdown. This is most likely going to be the best obsessive-compulsive character performance you&apos;ll see in a while. Roy&apos;s organized and simple life is disrupted when a smart and outgoing daughter shows up, somewhat out of nowhere. Lohman&apos;s performance as Angela could be described as a unique balance between &quot;lovable young lady with parent issues&quot; and &quot;sneaky little brat that wants things her way&quot;, resulting in a very solid performance (note that she was 24 at the time, 10 years older than her character). Frank, Rockwell&apos;s character, is an eager protégé trying to convince Roy into going for big hit, instead of the usual &quot;simple is safe&quot;. Frank&apos;s passive-aggressive patience to deal with Roy&apos;s shenanigans adds a hint of comedy to the movie.\n\nThe relationship between Roy and Angela actually remembers Leon, the Professional (1994) at some point. It&apos;s always refreshing to see small homages to certain movies – and this one by Scott and Cage is a refreshing, 9 year gap fill. Also, two other things should be mentioned. First, the small but decisive aspect that Roy always uses matchsticks to light his cigarettes, overlapping a character performance with the title. Second, it&apos;s based on a novel by Eric Garcia, with the same title as the movie.\n\nAn overall brilliant performance from these three characters and starting plot would be more than enough for anyone to watch this piece. However, the plot twist at the end, even though it&apos;s not that predictable, could be disliked by many (me included). Still, it&apos;s a movie worth watching, and one that I would recommend given Cage&apos;s performance and character.",

The Bear is not cute any more, the Deer is not funny, but unpleasant, and the other Animals are just miserable flat washy figures! \n\nIf I wouldn&apos;t sit in the middle of the row - I would leave the cinema in 10 minutes after beginning of the movie! \n\nLooks like it was just a sad attempt to squeeze out the last tipping points out of the name &quot;Open season&quot;...",

For instance, he attacks the global financial system and its architects, and portrays them as causing only suffering. But he leaves out the huge increase in global prosperity that has occurred over the last decades. He says that China kept its exchange rate artificially low, and used the trade surplus to lend back to the US instead of helping its own citizens. He leaves out that average Chinese citizen&apos;s income is maybe 7 to 10 times what it was 25 years ago. There&apos;s a story here and it&apos;s not all good or bad. The characters highlighted in the film are interesting and important - but the film misses an opportunity to reveal something more profound about the mysteries of our times - instead I think it leads viewers to simplistic conclusions that can perhaps be as damaging or more than Ayn Rand&apos;s philosophies.",

He is alive, but the people around him are dead. Through the whole film you are trying to piece together what happened. By the end you figure it out, but there are some things they leave untouched on purpose. Let the viewers mind come up with its own conclusions. This movie takes on a different type of scary. Like a real life scary. I remember a few scenes that when they happened, I couldn&apos;t help but shake my head and think much that would really suck in real life. The writers of the film made a good story and the director did a good job with little budget they probably had. This was a very nice suspenseful film.",

Pulling together a really terrific cast is a triumph in itself, and if the end result isn&apos;t a home run, it&apos;s still a decent double, maybe even a triple. I grabbed this off the Hollywood Video shelf based totally on the cast, especially Ben Foster (LOVED him in Barry Levinson&apos;s Liberty Heights, and of course Six Feet Under). While I thought it could have been more, especially with Craig Lucas at the helm (and I was surprised that there was no gay characters at all), it wasn&apos;t a terrible way to spend a dreary Monday night when there was nothing to watch on TV.",

I have spent a lifetime watching thousands of films from across the globe, and this junk easily fits into the top 3 Worst Films of All Time category. Indifference has nothing new to add after the first 15 seconds; Bertolucci&apos;s Agonia is just embarrassing to watch; Pasolini&apos;s contribution is pointless; JLG&apos;s Amore is beyond pretentious (to be expected, perhaps) and, as I actually tried to follow the student debate on Marxism, capitalism and Vietnam etc., I soon realised that they were saying nothing whatsoever. Perhaps - just perhaps - the directors had basic ideas about each set, but the execution is appalling. Of the directors, Bertolucci easily wins the WTF Award and should have been sent to prison in El Salvador as a prize.\n\nWho knows - perhaps this film is the reason Pasolini was shot?\n\nI am shocked that a serious film company would let this content be released - surely someone actually looked at it before it was distributed? But if they did, how could they not demand a total re-make? I really had to struggle to finish this film - the only thing that kept me sitting there was the hope that the next segment would be better. Which clearly was not the case.\n\nI want my money back.",

      "reviewBody": "Comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films I have ever seen.\n\nWhen I was 16 (20 years ago, sigh...), this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema, and my father insisted I go watching it with a friend. Well, teenagers don&apos;t normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies, but - man, was I glad I did!\n\nThis is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact, this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. There are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast, witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest, cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist I have ever seen in a film before the &quot;New Hollywod&quot; era.\n\nEven the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost &quot;avant-garde&quot; at the time.\n\nThe biggest fun, of course, is how Lubitsch takes the pi** out of Hitler&apos;s blind, fanatic followers. I don&apos;t believe the Nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and I only hope old Adolf has seen it, too). Mel Brooks&apos; remake is not bad, but the original is simply killer. \n\nSee it, and then see it again (and again).\n\nPriceless. 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "reviewBody": "8: The Mormon Proposition is not an excellent be-all-end-all look at the saga of the passing of Proposition 8 (what ended same-sex marriage) in California. The direction of the film isn&apos;t always in the most... I won&apos;t say professional, but that the filmmakers don&apos;t use the budget to the best of their abilities. There is music that sounds grafted on from a poor-man&apos;s synthesizer, and some of the editing and visual effects is done for lessor effect. On this count only is the previous poster on IMDb correct.\n\nBut the film is about something important- or maybe many things crammed into 80 minutes (this, too, is something of a flaw, but not a major one)- which is that the rights of people were taken away from them because a largely select group (over 70% of funds donated to get Prop 8 passed were from Mormons or groups affiliated with them somehow) see that gays and lesbians don&apos;t choose to be gay, and are unholy and so on and so on. That or, of course, the &apos;sanctity&apos; of marriage and how that affects their beliefs. It should be more complex, but in reality it just comes down to money, and an effective (hateful) ad campaign.\n\nContrary to what the previous poster said, I don&apos;t think the film actively sets out to paint all Mormons as hateful, or that the film itself is hateful. The filmmakers basically let the interviewees and the subject matter speak for itself. I don&apos;t even think, after seeing the film, that every single Mormon out there is bad or intends harm. But the organization itself, clearly, is corrupted by its top brass, who definitely feel the need to base their belief structure based on the old axiom &quot;God Told Me So&quot;, specifically their &apos;direct line&apos; to the Holy Lord. That this was such a passionate deal to have so much money funneled into the campaign is an insult to the masses of people who just want to marry, for love or (in other cases) for the same protections and rights that marriage affords. \n\nAgain, sometimes the documentary can go off a little from its primary subject, albeit for not all ill-intentions or bad results. There&apos;s a large chunk of the film, for example, that delves into the suicide rate of Mormons, and the horror for someone who is Gay and a Mormon (specifically a few are interviewed whose parents donated for Prop 8), and those who are homeless or on the streets as teens who are gay and rejected from their homes. This ultimately worked for me because the film is as much about the people and the high emotions running through the issue for all involved (those who are reasonable about it and those who are, well, Senator Buttars and his foaming-at-the-mouth ilk), but the film definitely works best when it tells this story of Prop 8. How did it get passed and what was the outcome.",

      "reviewBody": "If the South can make a case that the abolitionist figure John Brown was not a martyr but a maniac, murderer, and traitor, the North can point to the so-called pro-Southern guerilla leader William Clarke Quantrell or Quantrill as a bloodthirsty killer and thief, and the trainer of a generation of criminals (i.e., his followers included Cole Younger and Frank James...and maybe Jesse James too).  The fact is that Bloody Kansas was where the violence that became our Civil War began, and it lasted there for more than the four years of the actual war. There are few movies that tackle this story.  SEVEN ANGRY MEN and SANTA FE TRAIL gave us versions of Brown&apos;s story.  There is a film called THE JAYHAWKER (with Fess Parker and Jeff Chandler) about a pro-Southern fighter in Kansas.  And there are about four mentioning Quantrell, though none are totally factual.  Most though do touch on the one event of his career that everyone recalls: the massacre at the town of Lawrence, Kansas in August 1863.  Lawrence was the center of the abolitionist movement in the state, and it&apos;s leading citizen was James Lane, a particularly violent anti-slavery fanatic who became first Senator from the state.  Quantrell was responsible for ordering the deaths of nearly 150 men and boys, but failed to get Lane (whom he wanted to burn at the stake) - the Senator managed to hide in the field of corn in the back of his farm. Quantrell barely survived the war - he was shot in the back, trying to flee Federal troops in Kentucky where he had gone in a ridiculous plan to reach Washington and assassinate Lincoln (little did he know someone else had similar plans).  \n\nThis film culminates in the attack on Lawrence - but here Quantrell is beaten back, when Seaton (John Wayne) reaches the town to warn the citizens that the guerillas are on their way.  In short, DARK COMMAND shows that the sacking of Lawrence was a failure.  Regretably it was a success. \n\n Quantrell (here Cantrell) was a teacher at one point of his career, but he was also a thief and murderer before he found he could turn himself into a guerilla chief.  His patriotism is still questioned.  Southern leaders like General Sterling Price never fully trusted him - they suspected his motives and goals, and did not like the unregimented nature of his followers. Still, however, they let him have his semi-independent command.  To be fair the North too could have violent &quot;allies&quot; in their cause.  Witness the actions, in 1862, of General John Turchin, who let his Federal troops loot a southern town. Turchin was sidetracked for awhile, but back on the battlefield later in the war.\n\nKeeping in mind,then, that the film does take liberties with the historical record, it remains the best film about Quantrell.  It does capture the spirit of sectionalism that rent Kansas society apart, and it does capture the nature of Quantrell and his opportunism.  In Walter Pigeon it has an interesting surprise.  Pigeon is (with Robert Montgomery and Franchot Tone and Robert Young) one of the leading second string leading men at MGM in the 1930s and 1940s, usually in comedies.  In his case he also was teamed (by accident, as it turned out) with Greer Garson in a series of films from MRS. MINIVER onward.  Here he has one of his rare western roles (another is as the sheriff in THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN WEST with Eddy and MacDonald), and one of his few villains (another would be Morbeus in FORBIDDEN PLANET). He is quite effective - witness the scene when he addresses the jury at the trial of Roy Rogers - a jury he has individually intimidated in a nightrider disguise - repeating the word &quot;pain&quot; again and again.  This performance is the central one, though Wayne&apos;s Seaton is suitably relaxed and a balance to Pigeon.  Roy Roger&apos;s young McCloud is a surprise too - as he shows a hurt anger in much of the film.  Highly unusual for him.  Claire Trevor gives her normal good performance - she has a nice chemistry with Wayne, and also does well with Pigeon.  In the support one can name Gabby Hayes, Marjorie Main (ultimately a sad performance, reminding one of her similarly unhappy mother of a monster in DEAD END), and Porter Hall as the stubborn banker father of Rogers and Trevor. Even Raymond Walburn has some funny moments, one as a non-paying customer of Hayes.\n\nFinally, take note that this film is based on a tale by W.R.Burnett. Forgotten by most of the public, he was an above average pulp novelist who gave the world LITTLE CAESAR, HIGH SIERRA, and WHITE HEAT.  Usually he did prototypes of film noir (especially WHITE HEAT), so DARK COMMAND is a pleasant surprise that he could handle westerns as well as crime."

      "reviewBody": "This is another film which was often shown on TV (twice on the local channel alone!) but I hadn’t bothered with until now; it’s recently been released as a 2-Disc Set by Fox but, in view of its middling reputation, opted to acquire the film by itself.\n\nTo begin with, the DVD presentation had its good and bad points: the film was made available in its “Roadshow Version” – running 142 minutes against the “General Release Version” which eliminated 11 minutes of extraneous music (Overture, Intermission, Entr’ Acte and Exit Music); unfortunately, time seems to have taken its toll on the negative as there were several instances of color fluctuation throughout! As can be surmised, I decided to give the film a whirl as part of my ongoing marathon to commemorate the 10th anniversary from the passing of its male lead – Frank Sinatra; curiously enough, given his reputation as one of the foremost American singers, he appeared in few vintage musicals over the years…and it’s certainly a tribute to his acting talent that his non-musical work (often in hard-hitting, even groundbreaking films) has tended to overshadow this more familiar aspect of his personality – at least on the silver screen! \n\nAnyway, to get back to the film proper: I found it quite engaging and its considerable length not overly taxing – and this, to a large degree, is thanks to the formidable star cast (which, apart from Sinatra, included Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan). The first two had already appeared together – albeit in dramatic roles – in SOME CAME RUNNING (1958), while the others had been wonderfully teamed in the same genre and a similar ambiance in GIGI (1958). Ironically, both these films were helmed by a master stylist – Vincente Minnelli…so, perhaps, Fox should have struck a deal with MGM to acquire his services for CAN-CAN – but, given director Lang’s previous musical success with THE KING AND I (1956), they obviously thought he could do no wrong. The fact is that his handling is sterile and more accommodating to the Widescreen ratio than the necessities of the plot and characters – filming events from a distance and rarely cutting or even moving the camera; this lazy approach (which still landed him a nomination from the Directors&apos; Guild Of America!) is doubly frustrating when viewed on a small screen!! \n\nApparently, the production went through a lot of script changes (Sinatra’s role, reportedly, wasn’t even in the stage original to begin with!), songs were dropped and replaced by other Cole Porter standards which don’t really fit in (such as Jourdan’s “You Do Something To Me”); the rest of the soundtrack isn’t particularly outstanding (unlike that of GIGI, for instance) but a number of tunes are cleverly reprised (sometimes with variations and by different characters) during the course of the film. It was nice, too, seeing two world-renowned singers with such different styles as Sinatra and Chevalier come together (and having fun with it); Chevalier and Jourdan’s roles, then, are virtual carbon copies of their GIGI characterizations – but it’s a formula that seems to work (even if it’s not as central to the main plot this time around, Jourdan having been relegated to The Other Man type).\n\nMacLaine did few musicals as well but her vivaciousness (as a dancer and owner of an establishment which finds itself frequently in trouble with the law over the forbidden “Can-Can” dance, but who manages to charm the stuffy judge at the trial) ensures that her numbers emerge as the show’s highlights: the Apache Dance, the drunken recital of a vulgar song at her engagement party to Jourdan (at the instigation of lawyer Sinatra, who loves her but is unwilling to commit himself) and the “Garden Of Eden” sequence (intended to demonstrate that “Sin wasn’t invented in Montmartre – it was only perfected there”!). Two other important figures (though both severely underwritten) are those played by Juliet Prowse and Frenchman Marcel Dalio as the nervous but devoted manager of the “Bal De Paradis” (the latter was a versatile actor in his native land, but he was stuck with this kind of unrewarding role during his long tenure in Hollywood!); the former appears as a leading dancer at the club and MacLaine’s prospective rival – interestingly, the two actresses’ physiognomies are strikingly similar – for Sinatra’s attentions (a situation which is indirectly played upon during the afore-mentioned “Garden Of Eden” number, apart from which they’re teamed for the climactic Can-Can performance…to the predictable enthusiasm of the formerly disapproving head of a female Legion Of Decency-type group).\n\nIn the end, while this film can’t be considered a classic musical as such, it still seems to me to have been unfairly maligned – as some fantastic talent has been assembled in the service of a charming (albeit unsurprising) narrative to provide colorful (if uninspired) entertainment which the genre was capable of during its studio-system heyday…",

The beginning I found to be somewhat slow - there is very little dialogue until the sh@t starts to fly in the building. However, I found myself drawn to whether or not and more importantly who would make it out alive. \n\nOverall, for an action movie, it was good - no hero machismo, no action stars . The one and only rescue attempt made (in the truck) is put to rest within a matter of seconds in a hail of bullets; something you don&apos;t see quite often in a typical Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nThere are no heroes, no guns for glory. It simply tells the story of a group of people, thrown into the same &quot;merde&quot;, fighting to survive. Whatever remains of the bravado is quickly put to an end as you see how high the odds were stacked against them - the continuous legion of gunmen assaulting the factory in droves. \n\nNot to mention Fares, switching from French, to Italian to English without missing a beat. Rrrroow.\n\nA good flick"

      "reviewBody": "An even more difficult and abstract film than Angelopoulos&apos; debut &quot;Reconstruction&quot;, his 2nd feature deals with a man arrested after a political leader is assassinated. The man seems to have been part of the assassination plot, but it is left somewhat ambiguous what his role was, if any. In jail he takes prisoner of an official who may or may not also be his cohort. While the hostage situation is at the very center of the plot, we are never in the room with the two men, and never know quite what is or isn&apos;t going on between them.\n\nTied directly to specific events in Greek history of 1936, when Greece fell into dictatorship (I suspect only a deeper knowledge of that history would have let me experience all the film&apos;s many levels),and made during the second period of dictatorship 30+ years later (and so had to be ginger in how blatant it&apos;s anti-government stance was) on the broader scope the film is about the desperate stupidity of power, seen here via the various odd ways in which those in power try to deal with the hostage crises; rendering them at first impotent, and then violent. \n\nThe pace is very slow. This is a comparatively short film by the director&apos;s standards, but actually felt longer than some of his epics. Without an emotional center or any character(s) we can identify with, using all non-actors, many of whom give fairly stiff performances, the film teeters on the edge between fascinatingly enigmatic and simply frustrating and confusing. It&apos;s all a metaphor for a society going wrong, for the rise of fascism, but it&apos;s convolutions, distant performances, and (for Angelopoulos) naturalistic visual style never really allows us inside as his later, greater, more poetic, theatrical and emotional works do. \n\nBut it is beautifully made, shot from always interesting angles. Angelopoulos had yet to fully embrace his trademark super-long, flowing elaborate takes, (often multi-minute mini-films within a film) but there is a step in that direction from &quot;Reconstruction&quot;. \n\n&quot;Days of 36&quot; is a transitional film, as Angelopoloulos starts to find the voice that would lead to his masterpieces, starting with his next film, &quot;The Travelling Players&quot;, where his intellectual rigor would be balanced by an incredibly cinematic vision, and a sense of loss and pain, so one is drawn deeply in, even as you occasionally get lost on a literal level. \n\nNot a great film, but an intellectually interesting one, and required viewing for anyone interested in the arc of the work of this great master of images. And I suspect, as with all this film-makers&apos; dense films, I will only get more from it on repeated viewings.",

But when this film was shown at the Rotterdam film festival I went to see it because I was triggered by the concept of it being shot by 50 people from the audience.\n\nWell it worked! I was absolutely flabbergasted by the energy that radiated from the screen. Never before a concert film (even Baby Snakes) has captured the essence and true atmosphere of the show. This was a truly landmark movie, because after this movie any director that thinks he can capture a show with an nice crane shot is completely ignorant and out of date. Being at concert is an experience that is broader than just watching the band from the best position. you also get beer, go to the toilet, look around you. etc. That should all be in a concert movie otherwise it is just an old fashioned registration.\n\n10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Shirley-Myrli&quot; is one of the iconic paintings of the mid-nineties. A completely wild farce, a movie that touches on a lot of interesting topics, and also tries to test various assumptions in cinema in order to understand how new, now Russian society is ready for the proposed level of humor. And despite the rather frank jokes and excessive provocative humor, the picture showed itself perfectly, becoming over the past decades literally a classic of the 1990s, a time of change and a new life on the fragments of the missing system.\n\nVladimir Menshov acted as the director of this picture, already being a successful and even Oscar-winning creator, giving the world such works as &quot;Moscow does not believe in tears&quot;, &quot;The Draw&quot; and of course &quot;Love and Doves&quot;. His &quot;Shirley-Myrli&quot; opens up a lot of actors from completely new sides. What are several characters worth at once, which are embodied on the screen by Valery Garkalin and the inimitable Oleg Tabakov. The latter was literally delighted to play such an atypical character for his career, giving the audience a memorable hero.\n\nThe plot revolves around a wildly expensive diamond found in Yakutia, which is capable of providing a comfortable life for the whole country if it is sold. However, during transportation with a valuable artifact, theft happens. From here, the amazing adventures of the heroes on the screen begin. The diamond is essentially a McGuffin in the picture. This is an item that is cherished, which certain persons want to get, but it takes a back seat to the plot. The first one is occupied by amazing stories, sometimes wildly comical and necessarily extraordinary, and, most importantly, which could hardly have been shown as shown in the picture before.\n\nThe above-mentioned Valery Garkalin, Oleg Tabakov, as well as Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, Inna Churikova, Igor Ugolnikov, Vera Alentova and many others smartly presented their characters. Such work of the whole team, together with an excellent production and a very interesting scenario, looks fresh and even unexpected in a young Russian society that still reticently perceives the novelty of such an approach. However, the work done by the creators of the project turned the tape into a cult one, literally crumbling into quotes, which even today are no-no, and slip among fans of this picture.\n\nCinema is a kind of satire on our society, has political and social overtones, which attentive viewers will definitely note for themselves. &quot;Shirley-Myr&apos;ly&quot; is still remembered today with a smile and the film that I want to review somehow. An interesting story, a farewell to the Soviet past, a greeting to a new country, but all this happens with a kind of love of the creators. The film is good precisely because it has little connection with reality, but it necessarily relies on it. This approach was the very outlet for the difficult years of the last decade of the 20th century in Russia, becoming a generator of good mood, which is still remembered.\n\n9 out of 10.",

They are sort of engaged.\n\nBut Joy is attracted to take-charge chauffeur Jack Mower and Nagel is fascinated by feisty laundress Edith Roberts. What to do? Things come to a head when bitchy sister Julia Faye forces the wedding announcement at a big party and Joy and Nagel meekly fall in line ... that is until fate throws the couple into the paths of their secret loves.\n\nWreckless Joy causes a train to smash her roadster, but she is saved by Mower. And Nagel runs off and marries Roberts. Society is shocked by the marriages. Joy is forced to live in a cold water tenement after Mower is fired, and Roberts is the butt of Faye&apos;s endless jokes as she tries to fit in with the society types.\n\nWill love conquer all? Or will everyday life break up these mismatched marriages? It takes a blazing tenement fire to settle the issue.\n\nThe 4 stars all do well, with Leatrice Joy especially watchable. Julia Faye is notable as the sister. Co-stars include Theodore Roberts, Edythe Chapman, and Sylvia Ashton. Costumes and interior designs are sumptuous, and the Halloween pool party is not to be missed!"

      "reviewBody": "Marion Crane steals $400,000 and is escaping to meet her boyfriend. When she gets tired during a stormy night she stops at the Bates motel. When she goes missing her sister, boyfriend and a private detective start to look for her. However the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother is a place of many secrets.\n\nRemakes are regular things nowadays, but carbon copies are rare. This is a lift in terms of dialogue, shots almost everything at times. The big question is why? As a film in its own right it&apos;s not terrible but comparing it to the original it literally pales in comparison (despite the colour!). Why did we need this  sure on some level it may reach those who haven&apos;t seen the original and don&apos;t want to watch an &apos;old&apos; film. But really  why should we indulge the multiplexers who refuse to watch anything made before 1991?\n\nIt&apos;s not bad  it&apos;s poor a poor relation of the original. In the UK we often get 50th anniversary etc re-releases of old films nationwide (admittedly not in all cinemas), in fact Psycho was out a few years ago. So the idea that a cheap copy is good because it&apos;ll help open it up to new audiences.\n\nThe cast are all OK  until you watch the original. Then Vaughn stands out as doing a poor imitation, Heche is nowhere near Leigh and Julianne Moore has too much &apos;strong woman&apos; baggage from other roles to do well. Admittedly the all-star cast gives weight to the roles that were relatively minor  Macy, Mortensen, Forster, James LeGros, Philip Baker Hall etc  although really the question is why they all queued up to be in this toss!\n\nOverall it&apos;s so-so as a film. However when you compare it to the original it&apos;s really a poor show and, because it&apos;s a carbon copy, you can&apos;t help but compare it line for line, scene for scene, actor for actor."

      "reviewBody": "From the opening credits with that smooth Frank Sinatra hit &quot;Summer Wind&quot;, this movie never lost my attention. A quaint story of two wanna- be rich guys from Little Italy who unsuccessfully stumble through life trying everything to make a buck without having to work for it. You can&apos;t help but sympathize however with the characters of ROURKE and ROBERTS. They leave a lasting impression with the viewer conveying how life can be brutal in all aspects; whether emotional or tangible. And how good guys really do finish last. It was nice to see a measure of revenge for the two in the last scene at the hands of crime boss BURT YOUNG. DARRYL HANNAH adds a great supporting role as ROURKE&apos;S girlfriend who quickly loses patience with him. The one person I was most impressed with was MICKEY ROURKE. He showed such great promise as an actor in this film-his best, hands down.  I still can&apos;t believe how he allowed himself to deteriorate through the years in the way he has. He truly could have been one of the greats in the industry. That is far from an overstatement. Anyhow, this is a can&apos;t miss film-a sleeper. In my opinion, as good or better then some of my other favorites like Goodfellas, The Godfather etc. Enjoy it over and over."

From the very first scene, the film presents a world that is both deeply absurd and eerily familiar, drawing the viewer in with its off-kilter humor and playful tone.\n\nThe two lead actresses, Jitka Cerhová and Ivana Karbanová, give stunning performances as the two young women who gleefully embark on a series of outrageous adventures, from dining on mountains of food to wreaking havoc at a fancy dinner party. Their chemistry is electric, and their anarchic energy carries the film&apos;s narrative to its satisfyingly bizarre conclusion.\n\nBut beneath the surface of this madcap romp lies a deeper message about the nature of society and the roles we are expected to play within it. The film&apos;s critiques of consumerism, gender roles, and societal expectations are just as relevant today as they were in 1966, and the film&apos;s surreal visuals and absurdist humor make those critiques all the more potent.\n\nDaisies is a great piece of cinematic art, a bizarre comedy that you can&apos;t look away from, with a trenchant social commentary that is just as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago.",

      "name": "A racy thriller with lots of style and violence; but with little depth in the story",
      "reviewBody": "Vettaiyadu Villaiyadu (&quot;hunt and play&quot;, more approriate to say &quot;hunting game&quot;) is Gautham Menon&apos;s second venture into a cops life. This time a widowed DCP Raghavan (Kamal Hassan) hunts for &quot;a&quot; serial killer who has murdered his mentor Arkoiaraj&apos;s (Prakashraj) daughter first (in India) and, then later him and his wife (in US).\n\nThe story has all the qualities for a good thriller and to a certain extent engages the attention of the audience till the end. The movie contains a fair amount of violence, blood and gory scenes. So, if you do not like it, just stay away. After the first half, the story develops in a predictable style. So the key is that watch Vettaiyadu Villaiyadu, experience the thrill and, then forget about it (like any other thriller book).\n\nAs expected, Kamal Hassan gives a first rate acting performance which glues the audience attention to the screen. I like Kamal&apos;s acting but on a second thought, I feel that the character Raghavan did not really needed Kamal Hassan. In other words, it could have been played by another decent actor, for instance Surya and, same effects could have been produced. Balaji does a good job as the serial killer Amudhan. At the end of the movie, you will come to hate as well as fear him. Jyotika has done well with in the given amount of screen time. I also feel that the movie could have been done without Jyotika&apos;s character. Kamalinee Mukherjee and Prakash Raj have a short screen presence but leave a good impression.\n\nGautham&apos;s direction is crispy and good. With in a short space of time in the beginning, he creates the tough cop character Ragahavan. The script is good. Harris Jayaraj&apos;s music is OK. Songs are hummable and foot tapping. There is not much to say about the back ground score.\n\nThe movie has its share of &quot;flaws&quot;. For instance,\n\n(a) When Raghavan and his US cop partner zero onto a &quot;suspect&quot; Amudhan&apos;s companion, the first alert should have gone to all the ports to contain them inside US. Instead the cops go and knock on the doors of the &quot;suspect&quot; (psycho) without even having a backup plan.\n\n(b) In the era of fast digital communication, it is little bit difficult to digest that the news about the serial killers reach the Indian port authorities late (inspite of some US citizens being killed). Also, given that the travel time between New York to Mumbai can easily cross 15 hrs and, the existence of numerous channels through which the information could be sent and criminal being apprehended.\n\n(c) The serial killers kill US citizens including some police authorities. US does not even sends an investigating team to India.\n\n(d) Amuthan keeps claiming he is a university rank holder (a brilliant and intelligent guy) but some of the events does not fit into the character. For instance, when they come to know about the police surveillance they should have vacated their usual residence.\n\nThe primary reason for these flaws is that the first half of the story is shown through the eyes of an investigating police officer and, the second half is shown through the eyes of serial killer.\n\nEventually what happened in the second half of the movie is that the director ended up spending time creating the fearsome serial killers character (also resulting in some more violent and gory scenes) and, Kamal spending rest of the movie running around the trees with Jyotika and ending up as the usual villain bashing hero cop. Thus, second half becomes very predictable.\n\nInstead the character of the serial killers could have been developed through the investigation of cop, thus, keeping the audience more on the edge of seat and guessing. This would have meant that Raghavan doing some really good investigative cop work.\n\nNevertheless, &quot;Vettiyadu Villaiyadu&quot; is worth watching once at least for Kamal.",

I think the film brilliantly captures how a radio station (or a stage production even) can be controlled chaos at times.\n\nThis film was unfairly maligned in my opinion. I like the murder mystery/comedy genre. At times, it can be badly done, but here it is very well-handled. Brian Benben, Mary Stuart Masterson and the squad of celebrities who cameo, handle their scenes very well. My only real complaint would be that Christopher Lloyd and Michael McKean have very little to do.\n\nBut the plot twists and the resolution both pay off excellently and Mel Smith directs the piece with panache. There are also several great musical numbers thrown in as well. I give this film 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a given that the latest Hur Jin-ho film is going to be a bit of a romantic slow-burner, tracing the delicate path of attraction and flirtation and connecting it to the variable weather of the seasons (Christmas in August, April Snow). It&apos;s almost inevitable that this seasonal disruption is also going to signal a darker side to the tender relationships just recently established, with sickness, death, infidelity or simple incompatibility leading to trouble and break-up. You could call the films of Hur Jin-ho bittersweet, but the bitterness usually has a bit of a kick to it. With a title like &quot;A Good Rain Knows&quot;, you can be sure that Hur Jin-ho&apos;s latest film follows the now familiar template.\n\nThe delicate relationship in its tentative first flower of spring is one that has been rekindled when Korean businessman Park Dong-ha arrives in Chengdu in the Sichuan province of China and re-encounters an old-flame, May, a Chinese girl who he once studied with in college, now working as a tour guide at a park dedicated to the poet Da-Fu while she works on a thesis for college. They both have different memories of just how close they used to be, Dong-ha believing that they were practically girlfriend and boyfriend, May denying that they even kissed. Nonetheless, Dong-ha is attracted to May, and there are signs in the affectionate friendship that develops that they may be able to restart a relationship that has been divided by time and distance.\n\nThis is all handled by the director with customary delicacy and a lyrical attention to the detail of attraction and romance. The seasons are of course evoked in it being spring when May and Dong-ha meet, the rain playing an important part in bringing them together and holding them slightly apart, the pleasure of anticipation and timing noted in references to Da-Fu&apos;s poem that &quot;a good rain knows when to come&quot;. The sense of rebuilding is there also in Dong-ha&apos;s work, his company sending him over to sort out arrangements for the reconstruction work after the devastating Sichuan earthquake the previous year. Hur also uses the image of a bicycle to good effect, as a metaphor for relationships, learning to fall in love again being like learning to ride a bike again.\n\nHowever cleverly evoked – the gentle music, the gazing thoughtfully into the distance, the walks in the park and to the zoo to see the pandas (terrific panda footage though) – all this is rather insipid stuff that brings to mind the director&apos;s airbrushed efforts in the earlier April Snow, with the two leads rather blandly perfect and not assisted in achieving any greater emotional depth here on account of them having to communicate in faltering broken English. What of course keeps the viewer interested – if they are familiar with Hur Jin-ho – is anticipating when the director is going to drop the bombshell that shatters this cozy little arrangement. And inevitably, it comes with a bang...\n\nSuch is the reliability (and slight predictability) of the element of crushing tragedy eventually arriving in a Hur Jin-ho film, that one is inclined to think there is something either of parody or even sadism about it all, that the director is enjoying the slow build-up, before delighting in sadistically sticking the knife in. This isn&apos;t the case however. What Hur is interested in is exploring the boundaries of love and romance. As the otherwise comedic element of Mr Nam observes to the naïve Dong-ho, &quot;love does have borders&quot; and Hur explores these limiting factors on idealistic love, the boundaries where it fails, crashes and burns. Rather than being destructive then, it&apos;s these boundaries that define love and give it meaning, where otherwise it would indeed be bland and insipid.\n\nThis is all very well. A Good Rain Knows is beautifully filmed (if a little too clean and bright), played out with sensitivity and no small amount of irony and humour – a fine example of the director&apos;s work on this theme that will intrigue any viewer unfamiliar with his earlier films. For anyone else who has seen Christmas in August, One Fine Spring Day and in his last film Happiness (oh, the loaded irony in all those titles!) you will unfortunately have seen it all done before much better and with a great deal more bite than this.",

Any film that features a memorable moment like Deborah Foreman&apos;s articulation of her standards for a male companion, a memorable character like Michelle Meyrink&apos;s hyper-kinetic Jordon, and the memorable sight of a house exploding from the force of a giant Jiffy Pop container can never be forgotten.\n\nAnd who doesn&apos;t feel good just watching the neighborhood kids play in a mountain of popcorn to the sound of Tears For Fears&apos; &quot;Everybody Wants To Rule The World&quot;.\n\nAlthough &quot;Real Genius&quot; has not totally escaped the ravages of the past 20 years, it has held up reasonably well. Now it can even be appreciated as a sort of time capsule, demonstrating rather strikingly the complete computerization of the applied sciences that has occurred during the relatively short time period since its 1985 release. Other than Kent&apos;s incidental use of an early computer in his dorm room and a mostly decorative monitor in the lab, these now essential machines are absent from this techno film. Amazing! \n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

Regular folks with real life emotions, dreams and problems.\n\nThis was a bold movie by Hollywood&apos;s standards. No car chases, explosions, swearing or ego-feeding in this movie. Just great entertainment. \n\nFor people out there who love good movies; go see this one. It&apos;s made the way movies ought to be. Good story, smart dialogue and a believable representation of the subject matter. We loved it! Great Entertainment. Four thumbs up!"

COLD TURKEY as an ensemble comedy (as were most) probably belongs in the film making folder with THE PARTY or CALL ME BWANA or even MAD MAD WORLD.........in fact all those were UA releases too. A door slamming comedy with yelling and gawking faces, it features the last performance by Edward Everett Horton who I seem to remember kept farting.....as if every imaginable attempt to continually barrage us with anything helped to keep the audience reacting. Well, they actually did, and this comedy went over very well on the Saturday night I saw it in 1971. I laughed."

Leslie Banks&apos; outrageous performance has been noted, but Ian McLean, not a well-known film actor, is very good value as his long-suffering sergeant, with dry wit and a poker face. It is also notable for being the only British appearance of Liane Linden, a winsome Norwegian actress who might have made it in British movies had she remained. Richard Norris also impresses as the chemist Setchley, but his film career was cut short by his death in battle at Salerno. George Allison, the Arsenal manager of the time, actually puts in a decent performance, although he was unlikely to be nominated for a BAFTA. There are also splendid cameos from Bruce Winston, Maire O&apos;Neill and the actor playing the receptionist at Doyce&apos;s flat.\n\nThe resolution isn&apos;t entirely satisfactory - there appears to be no reason for the murderer to give him- or herself away at the denouement, as there was no damning evidence to be retrieved. The clue to the motive of the murders is oddly reminiscent to a similar clue in Saloon Bar, another whodunnit of about the same time, and the background is written up more thoroughly in the novel of the film by Leonard Gribble, recently republished by the British Library."

      "reviewBody": "A tabloid magazine threatens to ruin a television performer&apos;s career in &quot;Slander,&quot; a 1956 film starring Van Johnson, Steve Cochran, Ann Blyth and Marjorie Rambeau.\n\nWell, first of all, it should have been called &quot;Libel&quot; which refers to the printed word; slander refers to the spoken. You&apos;d think after years of dealing with both, someone at MGM would have known the difference.\n\nSteve Cochran plays the head of this trash magazine, a type of periodical nowadays so common one doesn&apos;t even blink. In the film, his magazine was the pioneer, probably modeled after the real-life &quot;Confidential.&quot; As in the film, a host of me-toos followed - in the &apos;50s, this included &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Quick&quot; magazines. These mags released Rory Calhoun&apos;s criminal record, accused Lisabeth Scott of using the services of call girls, that sort of thing. Something about the black and white format of the early tabloids made them even sleazier than &quot;The Enquirer&quot; types today, which deal mostly with gossip, hospital records sold to them by the hospital staff, and outing of celebrities. Eventually celebrities fought back by breaking their news first on talk shows.\n\nH.R. Manley (Cochran) believes that everybody has some dirt in their past, and he&apos;s after a huge female film star. He knows that a children&apos;s TV performer, Scott Martin (Johnson) grew up with her and knows about a problem in her past. He finds out that Martin himself spent four years in prison for armed robbery and intends to print that story and ruin his career if Martin doesn&apos;t tell him what happened to his childhood friend. Does he save himself and let her career be sacrificed? His decision leads to tragedy.\n\nCochran is cold as ice as Manley and handsome in a George Clooney-Tyrone Power kind of way. His facial expression never changes, nor does his smooth voice. He&apos;s a man with a dead soul. His mother, played by Marjorie Rambeau, is against what he does to make a living. Rambeau, a favorite actress of mine, is excellent. Van Johnson and Ann Blyth are the Martins; Blyth is really more suited for society women - she&apos;s very pretty and also not the warmest person to stand before a camera. But she does a good job, as does Johnson, who is very well cast as a family man and children&apos;s entertainer.\n\nThe story is dramatized in a somewhat extreme way. It will definitely hold your interest, though the ending could have been better.",

(He&apos;s hinted times and again that he couldn&apos;t have cared less about the stolen money itself, by jamming it into black rubbish plastic bags, as if he was going to trash it.) One of those life stories that you cannot help but get unpleasantly amazed with how all the reasonable prerequisites for a good life, though inexplicably, yet seemingly so unnecessarily, get flushed down the drain, apparently faithfully presented in the movie with understandable, ergo acceptable lack of intention to ease the answers to the hard whys.",

      "reviewBody": "Joseph Ross is a young man who&apos;s employed by a major corporation to come up with an important formula that could make his company and including himself - incredibly wealthy. On an Caribbean holiday along with his business partners he meets the very likable Jimmy Dell and over time they become friends. But things start getting really worrying for Joseph, as he feels that his employers are trying to take all the credit for what&apos;s about to come. So Joseph turns to Jimmy for advice on the matter and Jimmy gladly lends a helping hand.\n\nNow, &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; has got to be one of the most undeservedly, overlooked small-scale thrillers of the last decade. The only reason I can think why; is because it&apos;s really a glum and quite subdue film that relies on a well-written story to keep you mesmerized and rather bamboozled. There&apos;s nothing overly stylish about it, but it&apos;s such an elegant and easy going exercise that&apos;s professionally handled all round, despite the elementary factors. So don&apos;t be expecting a pot-boiler with plenty of fast-paced thrills from this one. For me it&apos;s up there with another under-appreciated 90s thriller &quot;Arlington Road&quot;. These were two films I knew nothing about, but when I accidentally came across them I was more than impressed in what I saw.\n\nThe shady, paranoid premise is standard stuff for films of this ilk with it being cluttered with the usual cunning double crossings and misleading revelations. But while you might pick up on the web of deceit with it&apos;s twists and turns, it&apos;s just that the complicated story is far more cerebral in its patterns that you are just compelled by it all. The further along the story goes, the more interesting it does get with the spontaneous structure flowing with concise dialogues and underling sharp wit. Just who can you trust? What are their true intentions? Are they who they say they are? Money, Money, Money? Well, we are talking about high fliers here ;). This sorely thorough cloud hangs high that it will have you thinking. Some twists and bluffs you might see coming, but really you are never quite sure how its entirely going to pan out. Also I couldn&apos;t shake the feel of old style crime thrillers from the glass like texture that was manufactured here. The film&apos;s location had an atmospheric strong-hold that got swept along with its softly, moody music score.\n\nThe performances were very good. Steve Martin was more than efficient as he played a unconventional role where he had to provide a real mystic edge and a laid-back attitude to his character. Campbell Scott was satisfactory in a pretty bleak role as Joseph. That&apos;s not because of the performance, but that was the character in the story and it&apos;s a real important element on how things played out. The support roles were strong by the likes of Rebecca Pigeon, Ben Gazzara, Ricky Jay and Felicity Huffman. Director / writer David Mamet has provided a tight and quite entertaining thriller that&apos;s a puzzle to work out.\n\nA vividly, ingenious thriller that plays it rather patiently.",

      "reviewBody": "This is not a fiction film. In fact, it reveals the way the guerrilla movement Tupamaros acted in Uruguay during the 70s. For those young people, it is necessary to remind that this left-wing movement was not a guerrilla in the mountains but an urban one, operating mainly in Montevideo. They used to kill esbirros (nasty policemen and agents) and to make justice against the existing dictatorship whenever it was required. The movement operated in a secret and compartmented way, i.e. many of the members did not know each other, thus avoiding to be eliminated by denunciation. Costa Gavras was able to draw the way Tupamaros acted in Uruguay, and also an important happening of those days, the way the CIA agent Mr. Dan Mitrione (Yves Montand) was killed. In fact this movement was disarticulated once new police agents infiltrated in the movement, and the main leaders were discovered. Mitrione was killed but this did not prevent that another CIA &quot;pinch-hitter&quot; for Mitrione came later to replace the dead man.  The film may seem as sympathetic to Tupamaros, partially it might be, but this is rather a subtle critic to their methods than congratulation for what they did.",

For some odd reason the film is set in London &amp; England, though only the inter-titles suggest this, there is one brief scene of a train on fire that looks impressive, that&apos;s about it.",

      "reviewBody": "Jerome Kern is the subject of this biopic that MGM put together as an after thought because even though it&apos;s about the great composer&apos;s life, little is learned about him. The movie was directed by Richard Whorf as a great spectacle, one in which the magnificent talent employed by the studio is showcased interpreting Mr. Kern&apos;s music.\n\nThe composer is seen arriving in New York and being referred to a man who is supposed to be the best in arranging songs. The fictitious James Hessler is seen as an influential figure who worked close with Mr. Kern and acted as his mentor and collaborator. By his own admission Mr. Kern was not an exciting figure, but he left behind a body of work that still is vital and has survived the passing of time, as his songs became standards.\n\nThe main reason for watching the film is to enjoy the MGM stars doing what they did best, singing and dancing for our benefit. In a spectacular and colorful finale, we are treated to a wonderful production number involving Jerome Kern&apos;s best known songs.\n\nRobert Walker&apos;s take on the composer makes a bland figure out of Mr. Kern. Van Heflin as Hessler proves to be much better. In the musical numbers we are treated by Lena Horne, June Allison, Tony Martin, Cyd Charisse, Lucille Bremen, Van Johnson, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Angela Lansbury and others.\n\nAlthough the film doesn&apos;t break new ground, it&apos;s a wonderful way to catch up with the stars in the background in some great renditions of Jerome Kern&apos;s beautiful songs.",

She nails every single SECOND of the film she&apos;s in; her monologue towards Rea is a devastating piece of acting that was shamefully overlooked by the Academy. This woman is one of the best actresses of her generation, and if you saw her hilarious, Emmy-winning spot on &quot;Frasier&quot; you know she&apos;s got strong comedic chops, too.

      "reviewBody": "Colorful and thrilling movie based on facts , set in rural South of Spain in the 19th century about Andalucian bandits , plenty of thrills , action and strong drama. This motion picture is a Spanish/Italian co-production compellingly realized by José Maria Forqué .

Set in Andalucia where had been proliferating ruthless bandits, who alone or in bands , engulfing the region with merciless assaults and ominous murders . For ironies of history, many bandits were good benefactors of the humble and poor people, giving rise to the glamorous as well as romantic legends of the generous Andalucian Bandidos . In fact, almost all of them were selfish and ambitious men , who could not be expected no sense humanitarian . These gangs were cruel and savage outlaws that infested the area from Sierra Morena and surroundings . These Bandoleros seem to have a whole praise by singing &quot;Coplas of blind&quot; sung in couplets and romances of blind singers which dedicated to bandits as &quot;Lucero&quot; , ¨Luis Candelas¨ , or ¨7 Niños de Écija¨ . It begins with Andrés (Luis Peña) killing a foreman , being helped by Pedro (Alberto Farnese) who accidentally kills a warden ; then , both of whom flee and trying to embark towards America .

To my surprise, while it is not the best movie, it is definitely one of my favorites of the year and one of my favorite comedies of all time. I hope I get a chance to see it again because apparently there are a lot of little subtle things in it that you don&apos;t see the first or maybe even the second time around.\n\n I think some people get too caught up in the fact that the movie lacks realism, but I think that&apos;s what makes it all the wackier and funnier. I usually have a very low regard for Asian comedies, but this one was certainly worth watching. Absolutely hilarious but maintaining a touching side to it. The characters and situations are so interesting and absorbing that you tend to forget that you are being manipulated by all the sappiness."

In praise, I must first say that this film does not shy away from the terrible tragedies that poor women endure all over the world. It gives the audience a look at a situation that we would probably prefer to ignore. The problem with the film is that it gets in its own way. It is true that the film is remarkable as a documentary for its lack of voice over or direct interaction with the film crew. However, hiding the crew seemed so false to me that I was quite distracted from the women that were being documented. It seems like the women were heavily prompted to ask one another revealing questions. Some of their conversations seemed genuine whereas others seemed hopelessly staged. They also tended to be seated or otherwise arranged in very tasteful and not necessarily natural positioning. The staged feeling would have actually been lessened if the documenters were present- tacitly admitting that their presence did alter the view of reality. As is, much of the film rings as disturbingly false.",

      "reviewBody": "You&apos;ll have to choose sides in &apos;Waking The Dead&apos;. Are you going to be an obedient politician or a liberal activist? Those opposing viewpoints cause a tug-of-war, with eternal love playing the ever-tightening knot in the middle. Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly are Fielding and Sarah; he the idealistic politician and she the faithful revolutionary. We know from the start that she dies via car bomb while raging against the machine. The movie&apos;s chronology is all over the place (which is occasionally confusing) and we see them when they&apos;re blissfully happy and otherwise. But after she&apos;s gone, the upstanding young man fears for his marbles after he starts to see &amp; hear his dead lover everywhere. Is she actually alive or is he just too insane for public office?\n\nSeeing ghosts is tricky. It can turn into unintentional humour without the proper direction. Director Keith Gordon doesn&apos;t pull it off as well as he should, but at least the heat between them seems real. Crudup and Connelly make a great romantic match. She&apos;s sandpaper to his block of wood, but she&apos;s also his conscience. The phrase &quot;Jiminy Cricket&quot; is actually used, and he succeeds politically only as he&apos;s failing emotionally. He clearly needs her whispering in his ear, even if he wouldn&apos;t agree with what she would have to say. It&apos;s clear that she wouldn&apos;t approve of what he&apos;s become and he knows it. So I guess that makes her the ghost of Jiminy Cricket too.\n\nThe movie would be a turd without strong performances. While no one in the supporting cast has lingered in my memory, the talented leads have. They&apos;re both good in almost everything they do, so I expected them to be an excellent duo here too. Connelly has since won an Oscar and Crudup probably will too. Some of Gordon&apos;s directorial choices undercut what his actors are doing. His style of editing and use of too many arty shots don&apos;t work. When the actors are already front row centre, the director should get out of their way.\n\nWhat grabbed me about &apos;Waking The Dead&apos; was that both Fielding and Sarah are trying to make the world a better giant rock. She&apos;s counterculture and he&apos;s as mainstream as it gets. Since the story boils down to politics versus religion, it&apos;s no wonder the film didn&apos;t find an audience. Most people have opinions on those matters, yet political correctness demands you not share them. But you ARE allowed to discuss love. The movie knows how to get that right...the ache, the irritation, the yearning, and the loss of true love.",

They encounter a sympathetic Buffalo Bill Cody (Robert Culp) and Calamity Jane (Judi Meredith) and obstacles.\n\nIt&apos;s a theatrical movie, but it&apos;s lit and has a score like a TV western: bright colors like a 1960s Louis Lamour paperback, and intrusive music that tells you precisely how you&apos;re supposed to feel at any moment. The script by Gene L. Coon is sympathetic to the Texans; Coon is, of course, best remembered as one of the producers of the Original STAR TREK, which was pitched as &quot;WAGON TRAIN in space&quot;; Coon also wrote several episodes of the Western series.\n\nKeith mumbles a lot of his line.

No it won&apos;t win any Oscars and it&apos;s not a dramatic masterpiece but it&apos;s never boring and moves along nicely. The fight scenes are entertaining, the chemistry between Marshall and Cuba is there, and the majority of the characters are developed. The only thing that fails is the love story, but I guess every film with teens has to have one. As far as people complaining about Marshall&apos;s wooden performance, I personally liked it. Not everyone is a charismatic, everyone is drawn to me type of person. He played it low-key, brooding, quiet, somewhat anti-social and it worked. If a film like this was made today, it would be a dumbed-down PG-13 version critics would probably love because it tells the story of a kid overcoming the obstacles. Rent it if you&apos;re an action fan, you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t find movies about illnesses whether they are physical or mental, real or fictitious, to be entertaining, maybe informative or educational, so I am approaching my criticism of this movie from the baseball aspect. Jimmy Piersall was quite a character. He overcame a mental breakdown to become one of the greatest outfielders in baseball history. He was a real crowd pleaser with his fielding and antics, but his hitting left a lot to be desired. He just about ruined his arm showing off how far and hard he could throw the ball. When he hit his 100th homerun, he ran the bases backwards. Living near Boston, I saw him play ball on many occasions and I met him in person at a First National Supermarket opening in Lawrence, Mass. He signed a baseball and a photograph of himself for me, but I had to buy two bags of potato chips (Cains, I think it was) beforehand. As a kid, I could barely afford it, but more than fifty years later, I still have the ball and photo. What a thrill it was! I remember him as being handsome and big and strong, not a skinny guy like Anthony Perkins. As far as the movie goes, it was good, but not very accurate. Did you notice the obvious padding to Perkin&apos;s shoulders to make him look bulky? He looked like he never played baseball in real life, he was so awkward. (Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig and William Bendix as Babe Ruth also looked pretty bad in their baseball movies). Did you notice that the stock footage was of Fenway Park but whenever Perkins was playing they showed some minor league park? Just look at the outfield background, that&apos;s not Fenway. What really bothers me is that they only mention one real life Red Sox person, Joe Cronin, and that was wrong, it should have been Pinky Higgins. What happened to Ted Williams, Jackie Jensen (my all time favorite Red Sox player), Dom Dimaggio, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky, and a bunch of others who played on the team with Piersall? Ted&apos;s career was actually extended because Piersall was so good as a fielder that he used to run from center to left to catch flyballs so that Williams didn&apos;t have to tire himself out trying to get to them. Piersall was eventually traded to another team, so all his euphoria about playing for the Bosox didn&apos;t last. Still with all its&apos; faults and disappointments, this movie is well worth watching, especially for baseball fans.",

In this case it didn&apos;t help. I had no idea what was going on. A car blew up and a man in bed with a beautiful woman got a phone call. There were cops in London, some of whom were apparently corrupt, and a rich man who wanted to get his drug dealing son out of trouble. I think one of the cops may have gone undercover, but I&apos;m not sure. I couldn&apos;t remember which person was which. There was a car chase which was pretty good. There was a chase on foot that was also somewhat exciting. London was interesting to look at, if that was where the movie was set. There was a fascinating futuristic glass-walled room high in the air that overlooked a river. The Thames?\n\nI saw what looked like that scene from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;, but if you enjoyed that scene, there&apos;s really nothing here. That sequence ends with rappelling down a building, but it&apos;s not a big deal. I remember one really good acting performance from Terence Maynard, who ended up being tougher than he looked at first.\n\nDo I have any more to say? Not really."

      "reviewBody": "For the most part, this is a black and white cheapie lensed in 1965 in England and based on a tired play &quot;The Obi&quot; by Jon Manchip White. A more exploitive title was tacked on &quot;Naked Evil&quot;, but don&apos;t expect any nudity here. The story revolves around an English hamlet populated with several Jamaicans, some of whom are the usual ruffians you&apos;d find at your local 7 - 11 mini mart while the others are an atypical crowd of Jamaican science students who live at the voodoo infested school hostel. Somehow, never very well explained, these two groups are at war with each other. Trapped in the middle of all this, is a stuffy school hostel headmaster who is almost always drunk. Also skulking through the badly lit hallways is an ancient Jamaican janitor who may or may not be making the dread &quot;Obi&quot; -- death objects made of old bottles stuffed with graveyard dirt and chicken feathers. As one can imagine, the goings on in this nest of unsavory types are breathtaking in their complexity. And for 75 of its 85 minute running time, nothing actually happens. In the last 10 minutes something actually does take place and those last 10 minutes are almost worth staying awake for.\n\nAfter doing nothing at the box office, this stinker was picked up by an American releasing outfit and was pastiched together with a color opening, mid section and conclusion starring the immortal screen legend Lawrence Tierney. The rest of the British film with a few minutes excised and strangely tinted were stuck together and re-released upon a public who in its wisdom still refused to watch. Now the thing was retitled and probably did some business in Texas where B movies go to die.\n\nIn conclusion, I must say, this is the finest film of the long and cherished career of Jamaican thespian Brylo Forde; without him this pastiche would have been intolerable, indeed. As it stands now, it is merely worthless.",

Entertaining plot, decent action, but the thing I think is most interesting  are the names of three of the characters: The sheriff is July Johnson and his deputy&apos;s name is Roscoe, and the main villain&apos;s name is Dee, all names used in the same way in the great TV movie Lonesome Dove."

I though that there was ANOTHER prequel that I didn&apos;t know about, until I continued to watch. Dominion seemed to me like a movie made out of pieces of film on the floor of the editing room. Clara Bellar&apos;s acting was awful in my opinion. I was completely distracted by her performance as well as several others.\n\nWhile not a true horror movie, I really enjoyed The Beginning. I&apos;ve watched it many times and found it very suspenseful. It kept my attention. I enjoyed the actors and the story. I&apos;ve watched it over ten times and the scenes where Father M had to choose those to die? Chilling. Who wouldn&apos;t lose faith? The boy being torn apart? There were some good scenes.\n\nPeace",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy&quot; takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970&apos;s, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America&apos;s television newsrooms.\n\nWill Ferrell plays a Ted Baxter-type anchorman (is it mere coincidence that his dog is named Baxter?) - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top-rated San Diego station. All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more &quot;diversity&quot; and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board. Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news. Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants). Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy&apos;s professional territory.\n\n&quot;Anchorman&quot; is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like &quot;Network&quot;), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb. The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial (&quot;Panda Watch: Day 46&quot;) that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits. Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in &quot;Anchorman&quot; ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever &quot;West Side Story&quot; parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.\n\nFerrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles. Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.\n\n&quot;Anchorman&quot; goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now. Still, &quot;Anchorman&quot; is fun while it lasts - and these days we&apos;ll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.",

Two interleaved storylines involve two detectives in towns 100 km apart. Young, feisty Kerkerian (Cassel) is investigating the desecration of the tomb of a young girl. Meanwhile, supersleuth Niemans (Reno) is drafted in from Paris to assist local gendarmes in solving a nasty torture-murder of an academic at a small private University. More bodies turn up, suspects become victims, and eventually the paths of the two cops cross. Visually utterly beautiful, particularly the College, the Library, and the glacier/ice tunnel scenes. Characters strongly drawn and sympathetic. One pretty straight fight scene, little dwelling on active perpetration of violence, but much lingering on the unpleasantly gory aftermath. This is particularly the case with the rather gratuitous opening sequence, which is overdone relative to the rest of the film. My main cavil involves the poor ending, where a last-minute surprise twist creates more loose ends than it ties up. Nevertheless, so watchable that this one gets 9/10."

      "reviewBody": "This is my favorite Buñel film. The story is stunningly presented, an absolute work of art, unbelievably subtle but always concrete. It is like a great symphony: every note is perfect.\n\nSurprisingly (considering the title) Le journal d&apos;une femme de chambre is not about sex, nor is it a journal for that matter. It is about politics, sexual politics of course, but also domestic politics, manor politics, and nation-state politics. The time is the thirties as fascism moves toward its mesmerizing stranglehold on a decadent Europe. The place is France (Normandy, I imagine) where the republicans hold power. In the streets are those who would be brown suits and among them is Joseph (Georges Geret), groundskeeper for a petite bourgeois family of degenerate eccentrics. He is an incipient Nazi, a xenophobic anti-Semitic man who worships brute force, an ignorant man that every French movie-goer knows will be a Nazi-collaborator once France is under the occupation.\n\nThe story is seen from the point of view of Celestine, a chambermaid of some sophistication (and an abiding, but understandable duplicity), a Parisian who has come to work for the family in the country. She is played by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau of the plastic face, a woman of many guises, many moods and an ability to depict with a glance any emotion. She is a great star of the French stage and screen who plays the part effortlessly, with finesse and a fine subtlety. The screenplay by Buñel and the brilliant Jean-Claude Carriere (who penned so many outstanding films, Bell de Jour (1967), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), Valmont (1989), The Ogre (1996), etc.) is an adaptation of the novel by Octave Mirbeau. There is a Hollywood film of the same name starring Paulette Goddard, Burgess Meredith and Judith Anderson, directed by Jean Renoir that I haven&apos;t seen, released in 1946. I understand the treatment was more comedic and conventional.\n\nSurrealist Luis Buñel&apos;s film is perhaps best described as a comédie noire, a genre antecedent to the familiar (and somewhat similar) film noir. In the latter the comedy is usually incidental and there is no attempt at any great philosophic or symbolic significance. Here Buñel not only makes a statement about the nature of the relationship between bourgeois Europe in the thirties and fascism, but even delves into the primeval nature of women and gives us a sharp look at a woman&apos;s place in bourgeois society. Celestine is duplicitous because she has to be to survive. She uses men the way the society uses her.\n\nBe sure and pay close attention to the final scene inside and outside the café and consider the implications of what is being shown. What is being suggested? Will Joseph finally get the punishment he so richly deserves? Or did Celestine make the choice she made out of fear? Is the union between Joseph and Celestine symbolic of that between the fascists and Europe?\n\nFor those interested in this last theme I highly recommend Vittoria De Sica&apos;s brilliant The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971).\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

I continue to be amazed and amused at why Bridget Fonda continues to work in films.  Is it the Fonda name that keeps her working?  In this one she shows the gamut of emotions from 0-1. Deadpan expressions, lack of any acting style, I think she thinks being a deaf mute means a mute performance.  Worst acting award continues to go to this no-talent actress.  And right beside her is another inept actress, Penelope Ann Miller.  Haven&apos;t seen her do anything interesting yet on film. Why does she continue to get cast? Kiefer Sutherland, whom I admire, gets nothing worthwhile in this flick. What a waste.  He tries.  And Steven Weber, whom I admired greatly in JEFFREY, gets dumped on in this one.  Another waste of a good talent. However, I did like the work of Hart Bochner, whom I have never seen before. He gives an interesting performance as the abusive murderous husband.  And I liked the dog, too!"

      "reviewBody": "I have to tell you from the minute that I saw The Ruins trailer, I knew I wanted to see this movie, we&apos;ve been needing a good horror movie, especially for 2008. So I didn&apos;t hesitate to see the movie today; I&apos;m actually a little disappointed. Now with the pro&apos;s, we&apos;ve got an awesome plot, it&apos;s a little unoriginal with the gore and the shock(ever since Hostel came out, it&apos;s hard to get a little more shocked) but the plot works and makes the movie extremely disturbing and makes you move around your seat and uncomfortable. The only problem I had was the characters, they were either very dis-likable or didn&apos;t even have any depth, so you didn&apos;t care wither they lived or died. It&apos;s a typical horror movie mistake, characters are neglected and we are left guessing, but this is still worth the watch for the non-stop scares.\n\nA four friends are on vacation in Mexico, just enjoying the time, getting drunk, dancing, the usual stuff. But when another man, a Greek named Mathias, invites them to explore the famous ruins of the land, he&apos;s also looking for his brother who disappeared there, so he wants to see if he&apos;s still there. When the group goes there, they are confronted by a tribe who cannot speak English or Spanish, and when one of the guys touches the vines, he is shot and killed, the others are told to get up onto the pyramid that&apos;s covered in vines. They have to figure a way out while being trapped there by the armed tribe, but something has gotten &quot;under their skin&quot;.\n\nThe Ruins is a decent horror movie, the best I&apos;ve seen? For the year, sadly, yes, which I&apos;m hoping there will be some promising horror movies to come up. I&apos;m just disappointed with the characters and their development, the girls were obnoxious and the guys were stupid. But the effects were cool and creepy, I think we all have that fear of these flesh eating viruses, so this concept worked. I also liked that it wasn&apos;t so jumpy and it didn&apos;t try so hard to scare. I would recommend it for a watch, but I&apos;m just warning you that it&apos;s not what it&apos;s all hyped up to be.\n\n6/10",

      "name": "whodunit Occupation noir",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;L&apos;assassinat du Père Noël&quot; opens with an act of defiance, the village school teacher Villard announces to the onlooking children that there are two ways to be successful in life, either through one&apos;s own hard work (&quot;propre industrie&quot;) or the imbecility of others (&quot;l&apos;imbécillité des autres&quot;). This is a slightly bemusing point decades later without the context that the film was released in 1941, during the German Occupation of France. It is one of those breath-taking moments you see in films of the Occupation where someone essentially risks their life to defy the Nazi death cult (another is a sotto voce mocking of the Nazi salute at the end of &quot;L&apos;assassin habite au 21&quot;). Here &quot;imbecility of others&quot; would appear to be referring to the support of the people for the rise of popular fascism. The censors appear to have been too square to notice any of this. There is further poignancy when you realise that one of the stars of the movie, Harry Baur (as Cornusse/Santa Claus), was tortured to death by the Gestapo very shortly after this film was made.\n\nThe plot is about a snow globe village at Christmas, and you know that given the title of the film, and indeed if you were a cinema-goer at the time, from the movie posters, that Santa Claus or someone dressed as him will be murdered. Who killed him, the Baron who has mysteriously returned after many years, or one of the various &quot;pillars of the community&quot; we are introduced to. It is a noir film for sure, the village in claustrophobic, snowed in, the atmosphere is thick, which bits are as they seem? Is fair foul or foul fair to borrow from Monsieur Shakespeare.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t really matter whodunit, not to me anyway, and so I wasn&apos;t bothered by the quick wrap up at the end of the movie. The main theme of the film for me was truth and fantasy. The teacher Villard is a commie and a freethinker, not of the obviously deplorable kind, he has a lukewarm heart as well. But his search for the &quot;truth&quot;, who he is the champion for is ridiculed by the events of the movie, although he is a &quot;freethinker&quot; his thoughts are obviously not free enough to realise that Catherine, championing fantasy, is almost completely unmoved by his wooing, and indeed that the reason for this is that they are no match at all. Perhaps the truth is like the white vermouth he habitually orders in the bar, not a particularly palatable drink. Perhaps the primary motivation for exposing the truth, is a deep-seated hatred. However the movie is even-handed, there are perils to fantasy as well, Cornusse and his cockamamie stories, for all their charm, mess with the heads of the children, as you evidenced by the bitter speech of the Baron, who heard them in his turn, and was led by them into misadventures. Catherine at one point talks of wanting a knight in shining armour husband who will kill any other man who looks at her, romantic fantasy can be pathetically cruel.\n\nThe encirclement of the police near the end of the movie is perhaps a message to the audience to hold tight, the world is coming to save us. There are hints throughout that even greater themes are lying just between the surface of the film, which plays with narrative and explores the nature of narrative (a paradoxical falsity that allows us to believe we have made sense of things) marvellously well. The two old men playing Belote may be our only gods.",

      "reviewBody": "First off, let&apos;s get my bias out the way, I&apos;m a die-hard fan of this movie, and this review is definitely intended to get the reader to give it a chance.\n\nThe film is riddled with industrial (music) culture references and cameos, and if you&apos;re into that scene, there&apos;s a certain sick thrill about seeing Carl McCoy as the zone trooper, and seeing footage of proto-industrial performance artist Monte Cazazza in this. The general tone and ambiance of the whole piece of wonderfully clichéd cyberpunk.\n\nAnd that&apos;s really the interesting thing about this film. While there are a plethora of terrible sci-fi slasher flicks out there desperately claiming the &apos;cyberpunk&apos; moniker, here is a film that claims to be nothing more than a sci-fi slasher flick, and manages to be somewhat of a pulp-cyberpunk classic instead.\n\nThe whole movie is a mood piece, designed more for its ambiance and the feel of its world, than particularly flashy action sequences or on-screen &apos;wow&apos; factor. It&apos;s meant to be a genre movie, but it manages to feel like a &apos;serious&apos; film under the influence of some heavy drugs. Not a bad thing really, but your tastes may disagree. Personally I&apos;ve always liked that sunset-filtered-through pollution look that Bladerunner was infamous for, and hardware utilizes the same rather well.\n\nGenre movie it may be, but it shows far less cheese coating and terrible acting than any of the current glut of genre movies being produced for the Sci-Fi channel. In fact the whole movie feels more like a good pulpy cyberpunk novella than a genre movie by far. Calling the movie &apos;mood music for rivetheads&apos; isn&apos;t really an insult to it.",

To salve his pain and to fulfill his duty as his sister&apos;s guardian, he decides to take some time to travel to an outlying village on a mission of good will. Whilst there, the village is overrun by murderous terrorist with sinister motives, not least of which being to indiscriminately slaughter innocent villagers for all the world to see.\n\nThe story in Kerd ma lui is solid and well paced. The cast of characters are adequate and they all serve their immediate purpose. There&apos;s a good deal of nationalism in the film as it does deal with terrorism and nuclear holocaust, but the Thai nationalism was refreshing to me as it offered a perspective that I had never before experienced. It was nowhere as political as the nationalism prevalent in many US films, but it was inspiring never the less.\n\nThe real meat of the film is its action. It&apos;s a reckless brand of stunt mastery that actually inspires fear and concern for the performers. Each stunt and flawless take seems to tempt fate. For example, trucks perform jumps only to land a couple of feet away from an actor&apos;s head. And though some of the choreographed fights between the less skilled performers utilize camera tricks for impact effect, there are some fights with hits that simply aren&apos;t pulled--high flying moves full of so much momentum and speed that they need to be slowed down in order to be appreciated. Speaking of slow motion, it&apos;s used quite liberally throughout the film. I&apos;ve heard complaints against this, but it&apos;s important to note that some of the choreography would simply not be seen at 24 fps.\n\nKerd ma lui is a good film that has a lot more going for it than Ong bak. It has a deeper storyline and characters that are likable and interesting. The suspense is more genuine and the fights aren&apos;t as repetitive. Comparisons to Ong bak aside, Kerd ma lui manages to be a decent film that is certainly worth a watch and, as always, it provides a glimpse into a foreign approach to the action genre. Without doubt, the Thais have succeeded in creating an action fighter that outperforms many of its counterparts from the west.",

      "reviewBody": "Gunfight At Red Sands is an excellent early spaghetti western. It is probably the best pre-1964 eurowestern I have seen.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this spaghetti was the one that started it all, as far as the style goes. The other early examples of the genre I have seen seem to be lacking in the defining characteristics that make these films so great, but this movie has all of the stylistic elements in place. The ultra-bleak depiction of life in the west, a couple of oddball off-kilter characters, a great music score (by the master, Morricone, no less), some great suspense-building camera work, a dramatic showdown, and lots of rousing action really make this one stand out.\n\nThe acting in the film is very good, and definitely above-average for a eurowestern. Richard Harrison is great in the role of &quot;Gringo.&quot; Giacomo Rossi-Stuart also does an excellent job in the role of Sheriff Corbett. All of the other players are great as well. The character &quot;Lisa,&quot; played by Sara Lezana, is one of the strongest female characters I have seen in a western. She&apos;s every bit as tough, and can shoot as well as any other character in the story, and she has a very prominent role in the most important action scenes of the film.\n\nThe story is a very engaging one, and it moves along at a really good pace. There are no slow parts or fillers in this movie. There is also a strong element of mystery, as Gringo has to do a fair amount of detective work to figure out who murdered his father.\n\nAll in all, this is a great movie that no spaghetti western fan should overlook.",

The original concept of Lassie never really appealed to me, I guess because it was slightly before my time. However, I thought this movie brought the spirit of the original Lassie to kids who never got to experience Lassie when it was at it&apos;s best. \n\nThe main actor Thomas Guiry, who played the troubled Matt Turner, truly carried this film. He was also quite fortunate to be surrounded by other great actors such as Michelle Williams and Charlie Hofheimer.\n\nI really loved this story because it expressed the true values of family and unconditional love. I recommend this film to families, children, and adults alike. I still love this movie and probably always will. I give it a 9 out of 10."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Abrigo Nuclear&quot; (1981 - 86 minutes) is a drama of science fiction distributed by Embrafilme, directed by Roberto Pires and written by Pires and Orlando Senna. The movie shows the harmful effects of the radiation, and the contamination of the human beings and the entire planet as a consequence of the soil saturation by atomic garbage. The humanity abandons the surface and has to live in nuclear shelters. The discussion about the dangers of the use of nuclear energy was a mark in the career of Roberto Pires. Due to his concerns about the controversial question he also directed the movie &quot;Cesium 137, o Pesadelo de Goiânia&quot;, nine years later. Pires was a disciple of the Brazilian physicist César Lattes, and a kind of a voluntary consultant of his works. The cast of &quot;Abrigo Nuclear&quot; was: Marília Araújo, Marco Bahia, Norma Bengell, Bárbara Bittner, Antônio Fontana, Nonato Freire, Renato Lavigne, Leonel Nunes, César Pires, Ronny Pires, Fred Ribeiro, Conceição Senna, Sandra Valença and Roberto Pires. The Brazil contributed with another film of science fiction on the subject: &quot;Parada 88: o Limite de Alerta &quot;(1978), directed by José de Anchieta, about the problems of the nuclear energy before the accident of Chernobyl. Born in the city of Salvador-BA, Roberto de Castro Pires, photographer, producer, writer and director, died in 2001, at the age of 67 years. As a photographer and a student of optics, he invented his own lens, that he called &quot;Igluscop&quot;. He worked in documentaries and was a participant of the New Cinema, in the beginning of the 60&apos;s with Glauber Rocha. With his lens he filmed &quot;Redenção&quot; (1959), the first movie produced in the state of Bahia.",

      "reviewBody": "John Carpenter&apos;s CHRISTINE is a tragic love story of sorts. Nerdy high school student, Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) has a hard time at school. He spends most of his days being bullied by the odious Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) and his gang of shop class hooligans. Arnie&apos;s only friend, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) tries to protect him, but bullies have a way of winning through numbers.\n\nThen, one day, Arnie finds the love of his life, a 1958 Plymouth Fury named CHRISTINE. He is transfixed, even though the car is in terrible shape. Embarking on a mission to restore her, Arnie will never be the same again. He knows nothing of the car&apos;s bizarre, deadly history. A history that&apos;s about to repeat itself. Everyone else, including Buddy and his pals, had better watch out!\n\nCarpenter has done a masterful job with the original Stephen King novel. As with CARRIE, King is great at portraying those who don&apos;t fit in. Gordon plays Arnie with just the right amount of quirky, dorky-ness. The mechanical monster &quot;herself&quot; is beautiful, and Carpenter makes &quot;her&quot; live, kill, die, and resurrect in a very convincing manner. Though it differs in some ways from the book, the movie is memorable in its own right. Arguably, one of Carpenter&apos;s truly great horror films.\n\nFor lovers of hefty, rolling mountains of steel and chrome.\n\nCo-stars Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot..."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve only seen a handful of Krimi&apos;s so far, but already it&apos;s clear that you can expect just about anything to happen, and while the plots don&apos;t always make complete logical sense - you can at least be guaranteed a damn good time! The Trygon Factor is no exception to this rule as the film being together several different plot elements and manages to spin a very intriguing tale of crime and murder out of it! Like most (all?) of the genre, the film is based on a book by Edgar Wallace and puts it&apos;s main focus on a monastery inhabited by both a group of nuns and a strange family. There has been some strange happenings going on in the area; including murder, and this leads Scotland Yard detective Cooper-Smith to investigate. It&apos;s not long before his investigation leads him to the monastery, but gaining a search warrant is a difficult task considering that the centre of it all is a place lived in by nuns. The detective therefore has to try and gather some &apos;real evidence&apos; on the crimes which will allow him to gain the warrant and crack the case!\n\nOn paper it really sounds like this film will be a disaster as there&apos;s a great deal of little subplots and characters; yet somehow, the story comes together and despite a few moments of confusion; actually is quite coherent. The style of the film is great; director Cyril Frankel delivers a great colour scheme and the look of the film really suits its wayward plot line. The acting is very decent too, and the film features a standout performance from Stewart Granger in the lead role. It&apos;s clear that the film is not meant to be taken entirely seriously, and this is to its benefit as a truly serious tone would have ruined it. There&apos;s plenty to chuckle at in this movie! The atmosphere is great and the monastery at the centre of the movie provides some nice locations for the action to take place in. The murder scenes are not gory, but they are entertaining to watch - the final one is not to be missed! Overall, the Krimi genre on the whole certainly takes a bit of getting used to but it&apos;s great fun and this film is no exception. Highly recommended viewing!",

Were there murders in the Dollhouse?  Was her mother an accomplice? Should I stop mixing Vodka and Drano?  Those questions are superflous. All I know, is that Creed must be stopped."

      "reviewBody": "With &apos;SherryBaby&apos;, director Laurie Collyer depicts the &apos;lower class&apos; culture through the story of Sherry Swanson, an ex-convict and former drug addict who attempts to rebuild her life and her relationship with her daughter. She finds that nothing is the way she left it and her brother and sister-in-law, who&apos;re now raising her daughter, have become strong parental figures and Sherry resents that and feels threatened. At the same time, she struggles to readjust in society, coping with her addiction, getting along with people and finding employment.\n\nWhile the film touches on some heavy themes as it depicts Sherry&apos;s fight, it thankfully doesn&apos;t go into full depressive tearjerking mode. At the same time, &apos;SherryBaby&apos; is almost devoid of humour. Through Sherry&apos;s perspective, the viewer witnesses how difficult it can be for the &apos;lower class&apos; Americans to get by with decency and how they&apos;re easily judged and blamed.\n\n&apos;SherryBaby&apos; works best as a character-driven piece. Through subtlety, director Laurie Collyer and actress Maggie Gyllenhaal portray the abnormal relationship she has with her sleazy father. While, on the outside, Sherry is a not-to-be messed with tough chick especially around other women, and an &apos;easy lay&apos; to men, her vulnerability and helplessness are confronted in her private moments and sometimes in the scenes with Dean.\n\n&apos;SherryBaby&apos; showcases Maggie Gyllenhaal&apos;s acting as she delivers yet another tour-du-force performance with her down-to-earth portrayal of the title character. It&apos;s a very balanced performance that appears natural on screen and the actress depicts the character&apos;s frailty, frustration, confusion with excellent conviction. The supporting cast is very good too, especially Danny Trejo (who is cast against type) and Brad William Henke as the brother who&apos;s trying to do what&apos;s best for his niece while giving his sister a second chance.\n\n&apos;SherryBaby&apos; is a sincere effort on the director&apos;s part. She captures the realness of Sherry&apos;s circumstances very effectively but it is her leading actress that very much leads the film carrying it off with a transcendent performance."

The storyline involves Simon, a kid with 2 expressions and a magic  teddy bear, whose Grandfather seems to be getting very sick. &quot;Of  loneliness&quot; diagnoses the kid at every opportunity.  At the urging of the frankly creepy teddy, Simon ingests a magic potion  and shrinks himself down to go and help Grandpa.  Once inside, he hooks up with Mapster the young white blood cell &amp; cute  piece of lung matter, Alvaoli. Together they skip through grandpa&apos;s  gnarly innards meeting such characters as the Secretions Agent and Bile  Duct, the bad tempered head of the gall bladder department, while they  try to stop the evil Calcium Crystals who are building a stone in  Grandpa&apos;s bladder.  The sets and costumes in this movie are impressively designed, even if  worryingly skewed towards the rubber fetishistic crowd and the effects  are pretty good too. (Favourite moment was the Secretion Agent&apos;s  &apos;wanted poster&apos;) And for those with the bent for the absurd this  movie&apos;s worth a look for nothing else than the costumes and interesting  look at how our bodies are put together (my appendix is WHERE?)  Best watched if: under 12 or drunk.",

Certainly not everyone in the biz ends up as destitute and lonely as Randy was - some do, definitely - but those who end up well-off in every sense of the word (like Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock, for instance) are VERY, VERY rare. Most end up somewhere in between.\n\nInterestingly, as precarious as Randy&apos;s health became, however, if he were in his mid-50&apos;s (as was Mickey Rourke at the time), he still had a longer pro wrestling career than many others who abused their body likewise. Randy still was made up of some very tough stuff and in fact beat the odds with his career length.\n\nWhen asked &quot;is pro wrestling fake?&quot;, I always answer, &quot;only where it needs to be&quot; - i.e., the story lines and SOME of the action. No one deliberately sets out to end another one&apos;s career, but like any other contact sport such as pro football, the athleticism and subsequent pain &amp; injury are all TOO real. There&apos;s no &quot;off season&quot; in pro wrestling, and certainly no astronomically high salaries as other pro athletes make - not by a long shot. But in pro wrestling you&apos;ll find the best athletes in the world.\n\nBottom line: It&apos;s a brutal business and an extremely hard way to make a living - period. That&apos;s why the men and women who stick with it and suffer all they do is for one reason only - because they love it. May God bless them all. :)",

      "name": "A refreshing attempt for an 80&apos;s slasher film.",
      "reviewBody": "I really like this film. It is probably my most watched 80&apos;s slasher film in my extensive horror movie collection. I find it to be highly entertaining, original in it&apos;s attempts, and decently acted.\n\nA group of teens decide to spend the night in a creepy old furniture store, which is owned by one of their fathers, to celebrate their graduation. Of course, a killer shows up, locks them in, and begins killing them off one by one during a game of Hide and Go Seek. While this film is far from a masterpiece, I think what I admire about it is that tries to be different from the other slashers pics that were released around the same time. It breaks the mold so to speak. So many slasher films released around this time stuck to the &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; formula of a looming, silent, indestructible killer and a final confrontation between him and the virginal sole-surviving heroine. This film strays away from that and provides us with a human killer who, despite is ridiculous motive, is both intelligent and vulnerable. The fact that more than just the &quot;virginal heroine&quot; survives is also unique and surprising. And though they may not all look like they are really teenagers, the characters all act like they are and engage of some very humorous, typical teenage conversations. Their acting is certainly above average for this type of film and I really thought Bunky Jones (Bonnie) gave a great performance, particularly in the final minutes of the film.\n\nThe setting of the film is foreboding and the film becomes pretty creepy during the final 10-15 minutes when the survivors are cautiously making their way through the dark corridors of the furniture store, only to bump into some randomly placed mannequins. The director builds suspense fairly well in key scenes and having a killer who dresses up in his victims clothing as a trap to lure his next victim, as this one does, is chilling even if it is executed kinda silly here. The death scenes are quite tame and underplayed for this type of film (particularly considering the time it was released), but they are still effective and the killer never uses the same method twice. Again, it is also surprising as to which characters live and die and how sympathetically the filmmaker obviously feels about his characters. They are a likable bunch of kids and it is really hard to root for any of them to die, so even though it will anger gore hounds and people searching for a high-body count, the result should be appreciated by those who sympathize with and like these characters. \n\nDespite the many things I like about this film, there are also things that just don&apos;t work so well. The opening scene with the killer picking up a prostitute is the definition of cheese and really doesn&apos;t fit with the direction of the rest of the film and certainly cannot be explained once we discover the killer&apos;s identity and motive, which is the film&apos;s main problem. The killer is ridiculous once we discover the identity and completely unintimidatng. Even worse is his motive for the killings. It sort of came out of left field and I, as a viewer, felt cheated. The dialog at the end of the film between the killer and his main quest is cringe-worthy, and it doesn&apos;t help that both are pretty bad actors (luckily, neither are on screen that long). The film, for me, would have been almost a perfect slasher film, had the ending gone in a totally different direction with a different killer. There are certainly some other cheesy, WTF? scenes, including one where the virginal, good-girl character is able to launch into a striptease for her boyfriend that rivals anything done by Demi Moore in &quot;Striptease.&quot;\n\nOverall, though, this is a highly entertaining film which outshines many similar attempts of the 80&apos;s because of its subtleness and . If you are any sort of horror/slasher fan, I would highly recommend this film. It doesn&apos;t set out to by an all out slash and gore film (which will upset some), but tries to be different and presents us with a group of teenaged victims who we can actually care about and get to know.\n\nFrightMeter Grade: B",

      "reviewBody": "THREE TIMES (Zui hao de shi guang) is so frank a film that the viewer may get lost looking for the hidden meanings in this century traversal of lovers&apos; interactions in China. Not one for simple linear film-making, director Hsiao-hsien Hou instead opts for mood and suggestion and leaves the paucity of dialog to make room for emotional involvement and response. Three periods - 1966 A Time for Love, 1911 A Time for Freedom, and 2005 A Time for Youth - are depicted with the same main characters, Qi Shu and Chen Chang, who prove to be exceptionally sensitive to the concept from the director: with each new tale these fine actors mold new characters and questions and yet allow us to see a line of similarity in the couples as the director has suggested.\n\nThe film wisely opens with the most successful of the three &apos;Times&apos; - 1966 A Time for Love - - tracing the emergence of timid passion between a lad headed for the military and a young girl who works in a pool hall. They communicate by letters after their first brief introductory encounter and circumstances interfere with the progress of their relationship in 1966 Taiwan. The middle section 1911 A Time for Freedom is gorgeous visually and conceptually the director has elected to use the cinematic form of the period (silent movie) to tell his story about the freeing of a young girl from the grip of a brothel madam and surveys the political tensions between Japan and China as the quietly lighted story of love and yearning unfolds. The film ends with 2005 A Time for Youth and here our lovers are caught up in the pollution of smog, cellphones, emails, nightclubs, and infidelities for same sex affairs that speak loudly about the tenor of the times.\n\nHsiao-hsien Hou&apos;s films are an acquired taste and many will find the choppy editing, the fragmentary scenes that are not always well focused for the story line, and the over-long length (130 minutes) too much to endure. But the ideas are fresh and the characters and vignettes are memorable, and most of the major critics in the media have lavished praise on this film. It is an interesting work but for this viewer there are enough flaws to keep it grounded. Grady Harp",

But all in all it&apos;s nice and has some kind of a calming atmosphere. I like it because it&apos;s a completely different cultural impression than what I&apos;m used to. Also the filming locations were awesome and somehow sad at the same time. Dialog was also pretty rare. If you like experiencing cultures or new places you will like, if you don&apos;t shouldn&apos;t watch this. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that some behaviors by some people seemed unrealistic and that sometimes there wasn&apos;t happening enough.",

Sole Survivor packs a wallop.\n\nThe story centers around Denise, the sole survivor of a freak plane crash, who starts seeing strange, dead-eyed people stalking her every move. In many ways, one could say this is a zombie movie, but that&apos;d be too simple. Yes, these &quot;zombies&quot; are corpses being used by &quot;death&quot; to settle the score and kill Denise once and for all since someone made a mistake and left her alive.\n\nThere are elements of Carnival of Souls, Final Destination, and the recent It Follows, but Sole Survivor is very much its own beast and it&apos;s all the better for it. Some might not like the very dreary, downbeat storytelling Sole Survivor dabbles in, but there&apos;s so much suspense, atmosphere, and scares that I have a hard time believing that any serious horror fan couldn&apos;t find something to like in this movie. \n\nIt must also be mentioned that leading actress, Anita Skinner, is a dead ringer for Chloe Sevingy.",

Performances by Janet Munro and the great Leo McKern (Rumpole of the Bailey) are quite good, and Edward Judd, whose career is introduced in this movie come together to create a create a sense of building tension as the audience finds out the reason for the strange changes in weather.\n\nJudd plays his character a little roughly, but that is to be understood, given his problems with his divorce and visitation with his young son.\n\nLeo McKern&apos;s dialogue and facial expressions are superb and create the perfect persona of the seasoned veteran science writer who interprets and unravels the mystery for us.\n\nJanet Munro, who died prematurely in her thirties gave a very acceptable performance for a young starlet, who keeps reporter Pete Stenning (Judd) at bay, then feeds him the critical information that blows open the story.  I have two copies - One I taped from TV in the 80&apos;s, and another that I bought new.  My sci-fi collection wouldn&apos;t be complete without it.",

At first I thought I had walked into an exhausting exercise in endurance of sole stupidity, but then I realized my mistake. These buddies are in fact in a confused state of mind due to unemployment. Hence mentally crippled and do the best they can. This is a very unfortunate clarity blunder, but otherwise director Dome Karukoski&apos;s movie is a master class in consistency.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Regarding Henry&quot; is a simple movie. It doesn&apos;t contain any explosions, tense/scary moments, or blockbuster action scenes. In fact, one might say that the movie doesn&apos;t really have any &quot;action&quot; at all. What it does contain, however, is healthy doses of terrific acting and great storytelling, which make it an entertaining experience from beginning to end.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; tells the story of Henry Turner (Harrison Ford), a suave, cocky lawyer who doesn&apos;t have much time for wife Sarah (Annette Bening) or daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen). After being shot in a drugstore mugging, however, Henry is forced to essentially re-learn life again via physical and mental therapy. The person that emerges turns out to be quite different from the &quot;original&quot; Henry.\n\nIf you need one concrete reason to watch this movie, the acting from Ford would be it! His facial expressions and gestures perfectly fit this movie and are much-needed in a film experience that rely so much on the &quot;little things&quot;.\n\nThe main storyline of the film--written by rookie screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams...now known the world-over as &quot;J.J.&quot;!--is also nuanced enough to never get old despite its relatively slow pace. The story of a man have a re-learn everything about his life is intriguing enough (and in this case just humorous enough as well) to really hold your interest and make you care about what is going on.\n\nOverall, &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; is a solid cinematic effort that does a lot of things right. It takes a great human-interest story and gives it some terrific acting depth.",

      "reviewBody": "The famous American singer and actor Dean Reed stars in this decent spaghetti western.He plays the role of the sly and adventurous gun-slinger Slim Cobbert who is hired by the mayor of a small town on the Mexican boarder.Somebody has stolen a large sum of money from the local bank and Slim Cobbert has to find out the robbers.A Mexican guy helps him in the investigation.Meanwhile,Slim becomes the most desired man in town and is adored by the young ladies.\n\nAlthough the plot isn&apos;t anything special, the film is worth seeing.It has a nice cast - Dean Reed is convincing as Slim Cobbert and the others do a good job as well.The score is very good and Dean Reed performs the song &quot;God creates them,I kill them&quot; as well.The film has lots of action and good dialogues.\n\n&quot;Dio li crea... Io li ammazzo!&quot;/&quot;God made them....I kill them&quot; is highly recommendable for every spaghetti-western fan and especially for Dean Reed fans.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Revisited it recently. It is the first film in the Bond series where Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to Dr. No, a former member of a Chinese crime syndicate but currently working for SPECTRE. Here Bond faces dragon-disguised swamp buggy, venomous tarantula spider, &apos;three blind mice&apos; n a villain with metal hands. Fortunately Bond has three amazing ladies to cool off, Eunice Gayson, Zena Marshall n Ursula Andress.\n\nSome interesting facts from the novel which is missing in the movie. The Chinese gangsters tortured Dr No, cut off his hands n shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead. Dr No survived due to a condition called dextrocardia in which his heart is on the right side of the body. He later joined SPECTRE n got his metal hands.",

Alfre Woodard should be nominated for best supporting actress. I was surprised to find two equally challenging roles for women in an almost extinct era. The relationship between the two women grows slowly. It is nice to see friendship between these two very different characters. May Alice becomes a likable person after awhile. Angela Bassett has a small role as her friend from New York City. David Straitharn plays an old flame who has since married and remain local in the Louisiana swamps of their hometown. It&apos;s a great story overall with characters that you grow to like over the time we spend with them.",

So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.\n\nThere are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role. She is dressed up as Grace Kelly, and she is not far off the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue. But the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run-off-the-mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the set design.\n\nThe finale in Central Station, New York is breath taking. It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof. The movie can be praised for its good use of architecture.",

There is very little meat on the story-bone and in times where, thanks to TV, everyone is an expert on police procedures the lack of logic is almost appalling. But throw the CSI-knowledge over board and you&apos;re in for a crazy and entertaining ride. Nicely shoot with some great camera movement Wan is shooting stuff to pieces almost like Hong Kong directors did in the early &apos;90s. No marksmen here, but who cares, this is pure pleasure for the eyes. Kevin Bacon delivers nicely and adds a whole new facet to the dad-on-a-rampage character. There&apos;s even a little &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; in him  and not only because of his gun and hairstyle.\n\nIf this is your poison go give Death Sentence a try."

      "reviewBody": "Ken Burns is properly regarded for the outstanding quality of his documentaries.  This early work shows the exceptional qualities that would lead to better-known later works like &quot;The Civil War&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot; and &quot;Jazz&quot;.\n\nBurns examines Huey Long, Louisiana&apos;s Kingfish.  Long rose from poverty and became one of the most powerful leaders in the nation&apos;s history.  Long was an outstanding orator, hero of the common people, advocate of big government, revolutionary political strategist, and totalitarian. Utilizing corrupt practices that had been common in Louisiana since the end of Reconstruction, Long built a political machine that constructed thousands of miles of roads, hundreds of bridges, and millions of school books (every child, black or white, received free textbooks).  Long&apos;s tenure provided much delayed lasting benefits for regular people in the midsts of the depression.\n\nSecret police were used at first to thwart the illegal efforts of major business efforts opposed to his tax-and-spend programs, and later the political vendetta of his national political opponents, including fellow-Democrat FDR, who dubbed him the &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot;. And yes, his secret police did what secret police do.\n\nAmong Long&apos;s national causes was the development of Social Security. Long&apos;s &quot;Share-Our-Wealth&quot; clubs had millions of members, distributed weekly papers, had weekly radio addresses, and elected many political candidates (including the first woman Senator elected to a full term in her own right, Arkansas&apos; Hattie Caraway in 1932).  Huey reputedly planned to run against Roosevelt in 1936 as a leftist third-party candidate, and expected to throw the election to the Republicans, clearing the way for his own 1940 election.  Instead, Huey was assassinated in 1935, and largely forgotten outside of his home state.\n\nLong is a truly significant national figure from a pivotal time.  He cannot be understood without considering his accomplishments, the force of his enemies and the conditions of 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;s Louisiana in addition to Huey&apos;s terrible flaws and dangerous corruption.  Films don&apos;t have much time, but Ken Burns manages to balance all of these issues, presenting a lyric, intimate tale.\n\nYou doubt me?  You haven&apos;t even heard about the &quot;deduct box&quot;.  Check it out.",

Like mostly all movies based plays, the pace is slow, dull and very talkative so in other words, not very cinematic! Next, if it&apos;s a comedy, it&apos;s not funny and it&apos;s a drama, it&apos;s too stupid. The characters are really disparate as we have the usual French bourgeois with a detective and a rap singer! My biggest disappointment is that the Christmas season is only a pretext as the spirit of this holiday never taints the movie. It&apos;s maybe about families but it&apos;s not familial and for those who think it&apos;s a French vision of &quot;Christmas vacations&quot; or &quot;home for the holidays&quot;, well, it&apos;s not. Geraldine does a good job as a wife, ex-wife, mother but we are faraway of having her in an engaging movie.",

People who are stuffy, proper, sophisticated, and politically correct in a social sense are not going to care for this movie.  On the other hand, if you are laid back, easy going, don&apos;t have to have an uplifting and moral story line, and appreciate comedy (often sexy and somewhat raw), you are going to love this movie.  The producer and director very obviously made this movie for the simple purpose of providing the audience with a lot of very funny comedy.  And they succeeded immensely (if you are laid back, easy going, etc.)  The scenes range from funny to hilarious.\n\nBuy or rent the video.  I&apos;ve seen this on network TV and it is very &quot;sanitized&quot;."

I thought some of the performances were better than others, but all in all, a fantastic cast. Loved every minute of it. Don&apos;t miss this movie.

      "reviewBody": "Wow i&apos;ve never read the books on this film but what I stunning visual film this was, right from the start it throw you into a world of mystery that open up to a whole new world of beauty &amp; darkness as the story is revealed. I will say tho this film might not be for everyone as it does come across as a Gothic teen feel to the film which is a cross between i&apos;am number four &amp; the seeker: dark is rising, but with a much better storyline &amp; concept. I love the storyline &amp; concept of this film, mundane , born human with immense power half angel/half human shadow hunters guardian of the light against the dark, this is what fantasy film&apos;s are all about. Lily Collins who plays Clary, wow she looking so beautiful in this film &amp; a brilliantly done performance from her with her character as she really shows motion &amp; believable character as she come to term with her destiny as a shadow hunter when she see things that go beyond reality.Like I said before this film is visually stunning with special effect &amp; concept, the special effect on the face change was brilliant don&apos;t to show a dark horror tone to the demons as well as the beauty of the garden at midnight. The action scenes were fair there are a few moments where it does get a little slow but it acceptable as you don&apos;t fall asleep or get board of watch it because it does throw you into special scenes where things get interesting. I also love the back story of the angel warrior Azazel who gave his own blood to create the mundane to protect the world from demons. Like I said before a well this film won&apos;t be for everyone if you like the dark fantasy films this film you will probably like, but if not your going to find this film is bad or sucks because it won&apos;t be your type of film. But it worth watching &amp; making it a part of the DVD collection. Dislikes : There wasn&apos;t much in describing the demonic world other than that there are people that have been taken over by demons that was the only thing I kind of felt should of gone more in depth with since the concept of the film is about a war between the light &amp; dark but if you can over see this then you find this film brilliantly done."

This is a horror/thriller that takes it time to catch you off guard.\n\nKai (Kristoffer Joner) inherits a house after his mother&apos;s death. It is pretty decrepit. Perfect for a horror film. In it he finds a lot more than he bargained for. Me? I would have been outta there in 5 minutes! KK (Joner) is dealing with memories and replays from a past that holds secrets. Secrets about the abuse he suffered as a child, and secrets about things he did.\n\nIt takes place not only in the house, but also in the woods, which really adds atmosphere.\n\nIt is nice to see horror films that pace themselves and use startling effects and heavy atmosphere to thrill you instead of over-the-top Hollywood effects. Horror is becoming the domain of the Europeans, while Hollywood engages in torture porn.",

Along the way, he also battles his own demons in the form guilt for his child&apos;s untimely death in an accident.\n\nThe movie is scripted well enough to keep you interested all the way to the end, even if the end if a tad bit tame.\n\nFive-star performances from all the leading characters ensures that you are sucked into the mood and world that Reema Kagti creates. Nawazuddin Siddiqi gives another stellar performance to follow-up on his performance in Gangs of Wasseypur. Rani Mukherjee redeems her acting credentials after the disaster of Aiyaa. Kareena Kapoor is competent. However, it is Aamir Khan who steals the show with a highly nuanced performance which I am sure he will rate among his finest.\n\nThe music from Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is very complimentary and at no time does it intrude, as it is want to do in Hindi films, into the story-telling. Instead it is very much part of the story-telling and at times even takes things forward.\n\nThe movie is another feather in the cap of Zoya Akhtar who has penned the story and screenplay along with the director Reema Kagti. The credits for the dialogs are shared between Farhan Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap.\n\nAfter the mindless films that preceded it during the Diwali weekend, Talaash comes as a breath of fresh air and bears a promise that Bollywood is not all about assuming that the audience is a collection of sheep waiting to be sheared.",

But while that film didn&apos;t stray from the book much, this movie simply takes characters and puts them in entirely new situations.\n\nThe aesthetic complaints I have about this movie are further.  Bastian and Atreyu look completely different (I know the original actors had aged), Pyorncrachzark (Rock Biter) had a child, and shots from the original film were used for horse-riding sequences.  The childlike empress is older as well.  She can&apos;t age!  This truly is a children&apos;s film, whereas the original was a truly beautiful movie. Shortly, avoid this movie and see the original again.  Wambos can jump in the Nothing."

      "reviewBody": "A brilliant but overly obsessive scientist has to kill young woman in order to constantly supply his own beloved female patient with fresh facial cell structures, since hers was incurably damaged in a nearly fatal car crash. Nothing really new or innovating here, as this was quite a popular premise the in late 50&apos;s/early 60&apos;s European exploitation-cinema industry. The downright brilliant French milestone &quot;Les Yeux Sans Visage&quot; launched the trend and also Jess Franco&apos;s &quot;The Awful Dr. Orloff&quot; and Ferroni&apos;s &quot;Mill of the Stone Women&quot; revolve on a similar theme. This dark and mean-spirited Italian production comes out as very weak compared to any of the previous titles, mainly because of its cheapness and lack of credibility. The other titles had convincing and naturally evil-looking mad doctors in the lead roles, while Albert Lupo in &quot;Atom Age Vampire&quot; more looks like an amateurish clown, completely incapable of developing breakthrough medical treatments. The fact that he spontaneously transforms into a hideous monster himself doesn&apos;t really help, neitherIn fact, that was rather awkward Still, there are some redeeming elements that Euro-horror fans might enjoy: the atmosphere is sinister, there&apos;s some nice camera-work here and there AND quite a lot of gore and icky make-up art to admire (especially considering the time it was made and the non-existent budget!). Too bad these positive aspects can&apos;t nearly make up for the slow pacing and the total lack of tension. The dialogs are sometimes hilarious although I&apos;m quite sure they weren&apos;t intended to be. For example, can you imagine a doctor saying encouraging words to his desperate patient like: &quot;Oh my God, your case is worse than leprosy!!&quot; Overall, I wouldn&apos;t recommend this film unless you&apos;re well trained in seeing trashy exploitation junk.",

Besson doesn&apos;t have to make the same film every time, he might want to do something for a laugh at some point, and that&apos;s what he&apos;s done here. The film is COOL to the maximum from the setting to the acting to the location to the soundtrack. It is a well rounded little baby of a film that Besson has knocked up in his spare time and just proves what an all round top bloke he is. Go see this film with an open mind and you can&apos;t fault it simple easy clean storyline lets the movie flow and move easily and when you stack on the petrolhead action on top of the layer of humour (which was okay) and put between good start sequence and highly amusing plot ending bread, you&apos;ve got a veritable good movie sandwich. Once again French film is proven to be quite brilliant. Give this to some blockbuster US outfit and they&apos;ll create some half-assed dross that feels like walking through bubblegum. Instead its quick, slick and an all round top flick. Only the Italian Job comes close."

      "reviewBody": "A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott&apos;s adaptation of Philip K. Dick&apos;s post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story &apos;Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep&apos; is a visionary work of art; it&apos;s a dystopian masterpiece and I&apos;d personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick&apos;s &apos;2001&apos; (and be advised to watch the version known as the &quot;final cut&quot; if you want to catch &apos;Blade Runner&apos; as it was intended by its director). \n\nIt&apos;s hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as &quot;cyberpunk&quot;, and it was also the first &quot;film noir&quot; in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere &quot;eye candy&quot;, it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"

Back then rentals were .99 and because it was VHS, there were a lot of exotic titles. \n\nI love watching old campy kung fu movies because they try a lot of innovations, and you can really imagine what its like to make this movie. \n\nThe film itself I remember having something to do with some Chinese guys in the old west. I remember there were 2 or 3 heros, and one of them had the talent of throwing coins with deadly accuracy. Also there is some weird love scene in the movie which looks like a rape but isn&apos;t one. \n\nOne of the innovations in this film is the closeup reaction shot. A person has a perfectly straight face, and then acts surprised, but only changes face expression. Its hard to explain, but its a laugh to watch. \n\nAnother innovation is the warping of locations. During the fight sequences a guy will often kick the other guy, and they will end up in a completely different location, I think one fight went from a field into a town, and then into a river. \n\nI&apos;ve seen so many movies since 91, but this movie which I&apos;ve only seen once left such a lasting impression on me, i&apos;d really recommend it for people who enjoy campy movies. Movies like this are campy but still fun to watch. \n\nI&apos;d pick this movie over anything with crazy jet li style wire fighting any time.",

Oh my god, &quot;shock&quot; what you are capable of. Due to her greed for revenge, she becomes a sniper within a few days. She goes to the end and learns karate and immediately puts on a black belt. Then she suddenly enters the police school and becomes a cop-detective. Incredibly bad scenes, incredibly bad acting... This movie should be shown as an example of absurd cinema in universities...\n\nA death scene in the movie was voted as the worst death scene in the world. I have no words for that, but the whole movie is nothing but Kill Bill. Tarantino should explain this...",
