      "reviewBody": "When I watched Twisted Nerve I wasn&apos;t aware of its controversial reputation and that it was quite a difficult film to get hold of. I was a little surprised to discover both those facts to be honest. The controversy that it caused in its day was due to the genetic theory put forward that siblings of Down&apos;s syndrome children are predisposed to criminal behaviour. The main character in the film suggesting that this theory to be true. I can see the offence that could cause but at the end of the day this is a thriller and not really to be taken very seriously. I have seen lots of murder-mystery&apos;s where the culprit is unmasked and their actions are explained by some ridiculous pseudo-science. And I think that is what needs to happen with Twisted Nerve – take it with a pinch of salt. As far as it being hard to get hold of and not seen by many – I have even noticed it appear on a public domain collection – that is even more surprising because this is a pretty solid thriller with a lot of good things about it. It doesn&apos;t exactly break the mould but it is still very good.\n\nIt centres on a young rich layabout called Martin who is molly-coddled by his mother but disliked by his step-father. The feeling is mutual though and Martin is forced to leave home but with murderous intent. He adopts the persona of Georgie – a boy with the mental age of a child – in order to dupe his way into the boarding house of a girl he is obsessed with and to enact his deadly scheme.\n\nThere&apos;s a pretty good cast in this one. Hywel Bennett is very good in the central role of Martin/Georgie. It&apos;s a character that requires a fair bit of range from cold psychopath to wide-eyed innocent. Bennett delivers the goods though and ensures that we believe in his character. Hayley Mills plays the girl he lusts after; she is good in the role and cute as a button. The cast is rounded out with a couple of strong performers. Billie Whitelaw is Mill&apos;s mother, who is a lost soul who takes in extra money by sleeping with the guests, one of which is played by Barry Foster, an obnoxious fellow not a million miles away from the character he would play in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Frenzy. In fact the film as a whole owes a fair bit to Hitchcock itself, especially Psycho but also the likes of Marnie. Its emphasis on the psychological but with moments of violence and suspense certainly puts it in the Hitchcockian ball-park. Another similarity is the Bernard Herrmann soundtrack. In this one he once again shows he has an ear for the eerie with the disquieting main whistling theme which is very distinctive indeed. It was unsurprisingly and tediously stolen by Quentin &apos;I&apos;ve seen lots of films and I want you to know about it&apos; Tarantino for Kill Bill Vol.1.\n\nI guess you would have to classify Twisted Nerve as a cult movie. One that seems to operate under the radar and one that is well worth checking out if you enjoy psychological thrillers.",

Most of their pranks, such as orchestrating a food fight at school, are harmless until they get involved in a plot to steal top-secret government files and so the movie is about them trying to recover the stolen information.\n\nSince it&apos;s every kid&apos;s (and a few adults) dream to be a secret agent, this movie will probably occupy its target audience fairly well. However, the acting was really bad, the character development was non-existent, and the special effects weren&apos;t very special for a 2005 movie. It&apos;s also entirely unbelievable, but I expected that.\n\nBasically, it just falls flat. It will not go down in history as a great movie, nor spin-off into a TV show, nor be the next &quot;must buy&quot; DVD. It just wasn&apos;t anything special. I did like the ending, though.\n\nSo, if your expectations are low, and you just want a fun, family-friendly movie to occupy your 7-year-old, go for it. You&apos;ll enjoy it. But otherwise, I wouldn&apos;t recommend.",

      "reviewBody": "The spaceships Argos commanded by Captain Mark Markary (Barry Sullivan) and her sister Galliot commanded by Captain Sallas (Massimo Righi) travel to the mysterious planet Aura to investigate a strange transmission of a distress signal. The spaceships are protected by the meteor rejector instrument but on the arrival, the gravity increases and the automatic controls go haywire and the Galliot crashes on the surface of Aura. Then the crew-members in Argos go crazy and attack each other in a first moment. Soon Captain Mark finds that most of the crew from Argos is dead after fighting against each other. When the dead members resurrect, Captain Mark, communications officer Sanya (Norma Bengell) and engineer Wess (Ángel Aranda) discover that parasite bodiless aliens have entrapped them with the transmission expecting to flee from their dying world. What will be their attitude?\n\n&quot;Terrore nello spazio&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot;, despite the low- budget, is an original, stylish and with a surprising plot point. The conclusion shows a great surprise to the viewer. This movie was certainly the major influence to at least Ridley Scott&apos;s &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Prometheus&quot; that have similar storyline. It was said that the set was a Tower of Babel, with international cast using their own native language (Barry Sullivan, English; Norma Bengell, Portuguese; Ángel Aranda, Spanish; and Evi Marandi, English). My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Planeta dos Vampiros&quot; (&quot;The Planet of the Vampires&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "The main attraction of the film is to watch Anna Magnani and Vittorio de Sica act together, and they alone raise the film to some level of classical comedy. It is really a tragi-comedy, because Anna Magnani is outrageously rich from her black market business during the war, and she learns the hard way that money does not bring esteem or respectability but only makes you vulnerable to parasites and vultures. There are some hilarious ironic scenes in the den of the so called aristocrats, all frauds, who cheat her out of all her money by their sanctimoniously affected manners to cajole and trap her in their racket, they are all splendid caricatures of fake snobs and adulating freaks. Anna Magnani herself dominates the film by her overwhelmingly splendid acting, going from something of a queen and primadonna of smugglers to the real down to earth Anna Magnani with a firm realistic grip on the facts of life. The other great comedian of this film is John Garson as the fat Californian soldier Lucky Brandy (!), who adorns the film by his fluent Italian with a very American accent making it hilarious, especially for Italians, probably. Vittorio de Sica adds style to the film as the count whose palace she is renting and who also has to face sinister facts of reality. In the final scene the film suddenly turns romantic and beautiful, enhanced in charm by some lovely street musicians, illustrating the return to basic reality from the false illusions of a luxurious but meaningless and superficial life of delusions.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Mallrats&apos; but is the kind of film you either like or don&apos;t like which is pretty much the case with any Kevin Smith movie. I liked it. I enjoyed all the dirty street humour, the awkwardness, the characters and the concept.\n\nIt&apos;s full of slapstick comedies, comic book &apos;adventure&apos; and some witty (and dirty) dialogues. Even though many of the situations are unrealistic, it&apos;s hilarious.\n\n&apos;Mallrats&apos; is about two friends who both lose their girlfriends. The two friends spend the rest of the day in the mall discussing things and what to do about them. In the mall they meet some friends, enemies, and weirdos. Though the plot isn&apos;t what would be referred to as a work of &apos;genius&apos;, it&apos;s more the characters and the funny situations that will stick to mind.\n\nThe only sequence I didn&apos;t like was the toilet humour bit, about making the hand stink. That sort of brought down the film a little. The film was already on the right track with its funny characters and funny situations. There was no need for toilet humour.\n\nLondon and Lee play the two friends. London is okay while Lee is very good. He pretty much steals every scene. Doherty and Forlani are adequate. Lauren Adams is brilliant in a brief role and Affleck is good as the evil Salesman. Mewes and Smith are alright (though some may feel that they go a little over the top).\n\nSo all in all, you&apos;ll meet some very weird (and not-so-weird) characters and exaggerated situations but I think you&apos;ll at least have some good laughs. It&apos;s one of the better comedies from a country that has made dozens of blockbuster garbage like &apos;American Pie&apos;."

      "reviewBody": "I may be one of those movie buffs who&apos;s at least willing to confess that they&apos;re not a huge admirer or fan of a certain actor or director. Jean-Claude Van Damme would be near the top of my list of actors that I only admire although I&apos;ve seen a few films where he has his name is on the poster.\n\n&quot;Sudden Death&quot; is the second film that Van Damme has starred in with photographer/director Peter Hyams (&quot;End of Days&quot;, &quot;Timecop&quot;) is at the helm.\n\nThis film was based on an actual story by Karen Baldwin and is adapted into the story by Gene Quintano.\n\nThe movie takes place at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh where the Chicago Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penquins are about to take the ice for the last game of the Stanley Cup finals.  Van Damme&apos;s character, Darren McCord, takes his son and daughter to the game.  As usual, the arena is packed with fans and the Vice President of the U.S. has come to see the game as well.  Unfortunately, Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe), a demented terrorist and a small band of terrorists take control of the Owner&apos;s box where the V.P. and several people.  Foss demands that he wants a billion dollars and how he wants to use it puzzles me.  However, at the end of each period, if his demand isn&apos;t met, Foss shoots someone and if the deal isn&apos;t done at the end of the game.  The arena is blown sky high with several explosives that are set all over the arena.\n\nBoothe is good here and he makes the threat very real, which is key to making any thriller.  He also shows some wit and in one particular scene, the Vice President curiously asks Foss &quot;What kind of lunatic are you?&quot; Foss responds - &quot;The best kind.&quot;\n\nWhat draws McCord into the situation is when his daughter is taken up to the Owner&apos;s box.  From there on, the movie manages to make the excitement to be interesting.  One example would be the fight scenes that McCord has with a couple of thugs in the kitchen at two seperate times.  Just about every prop is used from the meat slicer to the bone, which goes through one of the neck of a terrorist.  Fun and yucky isn&apos;t it?\n\nThe last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is.  I&apos;m undecided if &quot;Sudden Death&quot; would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer&apos;s &quot;Black Sunday&quot;.  Van Damme and Boothe are both good here.",

      "reviewBody": "Not being much of a fan of this type of thriller, I started to watch this film one day, years ago here in the UK with little interest. While watching it I was struck by the rarity of a character like Audrey Macleah, played in such a understated manner by a actress I had never heard of, never having even seen a tv series called Profiler at that time.\n\nThe films plot seems to be intelligent and well crafted, with enough depth to keep you on edge until the end. The final act at the Eben house is particulary suspenseful. I lack the credentials to say whenever the film is a good example of its genre but must return to Audrey Macleah/Ally Walker. The manner in which the character is portrayed as a brilliant academic, although lacking in confidence and with her own past demons just hiding under the surface is masterful. A nice touch is the way in which these are left unresolved, rather than a more typical, heavy handed approach.\n\n One of my favourites, and well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "There are some movies one enjoyed years ago that now, in the light of a more progressive culture, seem disturbing. But I found Gigi inherently creepy when I first saw it as a teenager in the &apos;70s. Admittedly some things bother me more now than then, like a middle-aged man singing about how great little girls are because when they&apos;re teenagers he&apos;ll have sex with them, but the central premise always struck me as deeply disturbing.\n\nThis is essentially a movie about a young girl pushed into sex work by her family of sex workers. She does not, at first, understand that&apos;s what&apos;s happening, but when she figures it out she&apos;s not happy about it. And I just don&apos;t see how that can be alright. It would be one thing if this were a commentary on a time when most women&apos;s only real path to power and fortune was through sex, but that&apos;s not what this is. This is a light frothy musical about something really bad.\n\nAnd it&apos;s a shame, because it&apos;s full of great songs. Ignoring the sleaziness, Thank Heaven for Little Girls is charming. The Night they Invented Champaign is a fun, amusing number, as is I Remember it Well. \n\nThe performances are excellent, particularly Leslie Caron as Gigi. But I can&apos;t even watch this movie because I find it so creepy. Gigi&apos;s situation is heartbreaking, and while yes, it&apos;s a 50s musical that resolves everything pleasantly, Gigi is powerless in the equation.\n\nAs a youth I was horrified by a movie about someone my age who&apos;s agency had been taken away by &quot;well meaning&quot; relatives. As an adult I find it even more disturbing. \n\nAnd yeah, a lot of people are just going to say I&apos;m a buzzkill and it&apos;s just light froth. But I can&apos;t see it that way.",

Jackson is the one who shines. His performance does truly elevate this movie onto a level it couldn&apos;t have reached without him! \n\nHis presence is really phenomenal and when he is on screen you can feel his aura. When he delivers his dialogue it&apos;s pretty strong, even if the dialogue itself might not be the best, his interpretation of it, makes it stronger. There is one particular dialogue scene, where he is really showing a different side of his character (look for the &quot;Whatever&quot; speech).\n\nSadly the movie has also quite a few low points, which would be weighing a lot more, if Samuel weren&apos;t to play the foe here. Some clichés and the predictability of the whole thing/story. Still worth a watch, if alone (and I can&apos;t point that out enough) for Samuel&apos;s performance!",

This was 1988 and no band or any multimedia presentation since has come close! The Olympics and Superbowl have had some good multimedia displays, and that video of the building in Germany I think when they used a projector to make some 3D images, the Tupac hologram, and some of the videos of Christmas lights are cool, but this was 2 hours of that stuff combined with the clearest 3D surround sound music you&apos;ve ever heard at a live event! Tickets were $25 when most tickets were $15, but it was well worth it! The concert is on YouTube and if you haven&apos;t seen it check out &quot;One of These Days&quot; or &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; if you want to see why a light show is called a light show! I have no idea how promoters are getting people to pay $450 for floor seats now! $25 back then was 2 tanks of gas and now 2 tanks of gas is $100 and if a band isn&apos;t giving a multimedia presentation equal to this for $100 you&apos;re being financially raped! I bought like 8 copies of this on VHS back in the day. I had to replace them because the VCR ate them, or because friends borrowed/stole them, or because I played them so much they wore out. The CD doesn&apos;t have &quot;One Slip&quot; but the DVD doesn&apos;t have &quot;Money&quot;! Can you imagine releasing a Pink Floyd video and cutting out &quot;Money&quot;?",

While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.\n\nAnyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.",

      "reviewBody": "I just re-watched Priest after 12 years, and I think it is even more powerful and relevant now it was then, given the scandals in the Catholic Church and the rise of religious militancy and fundamentalism in the world.\n\nWhile occasionally teetering on the brink of preachiness and soap opera, Priest is saved by tight direction and very fine acting. It effectively shows the humaness of people in the Church, as opposed to how some would have you believe.\n\nAs a person not all attached to organized religion, I obviously find much to approve of here. But the strength of Priest is that someone who loves the Catholic Church for what is really is, the teachings of Jesus, and not what cruel, irrational and ignorant human beings have made of it will find much to be enriched by here. Priest is not anti-Catholic at all, not in the true sense of the word. Rather, it is anti human folly.\n\nOf course that segment that is fundamentalist and inflexible, who cannot imagine - horrors! - that a Priest could be gay have and will continue to express their moral outrage and call this &quot;hate speech.&quot;\n\nAs a final note, I also happened to read Roger Ebert&apos;s inexplicible review of Priest. If I hadn&apos;t seen his name on it, I would think it was written by Michael Medved. Since Ebert is generally religion neutral and very gay positive, I simply don&apos;t understand his outrage at all - very puzzling indeed. And he gives Mel&apos;s hideous Passion of the Christ, one of the most immoral and disgusting movies ever made (again most especially if you ARE religious) a perfect 10.",

Let&apos;s hope this film is watched by many people who start questioning their own habits - do you only buy flawless fruit? Do you buy more food than you can eat? Do you still drink milk that is beyond its &quot;best before&quot; date?",

      "reviewBody": "If I may begin with a quote from The Wire I will because, when considering this film the phrase &quot;all the pieces matter&quot; did come to my mind. The film presents itself as another in a recent line of documentaries that very much appeal to people of my demographic because it puts an unacceptable situation in front of us and challenges the way we live our lives and allow our lives to be lived. In the case of Black Gold, the subject is coffee and, as a &quot;fair trade&quot; buyer of some time I was looking to have my opinion of the subject informed.\n\nThe structure of the film looks at coffee in Ethiopia, Seattle, London and so on as it paints a picture of situation where what the growers get paid is a shameful pittance compared to the amount the western coffee drinker would pay for even a home-made cup from granules. It should be shockingly compelling stuff and I was astonishing to find that it was not at all like this. It is maybe a failing in the structure because the makers seem to have had great access to the subject through Tadessa Meskela, who leads a cooperative of Ethiopian coffee farmers. This does mean that we spend too much time at his level and seeing things with his eyes, which works but is not the best way of carrying the film. Of course this needs to be part of it but it is almost the all.\n\nWhat it badly needed was a much wider view. OK the corporations unsurprisingly did not wish to take part in this film but it badly needs some evidence of them and their role in the pricing. Without this focus the film doesn&apos;t really offer many answers or present a driver for the terrible situations it lets us see. To some viewers I&apos;m sure this will be praise worthy because a documentary need not be about emotion and banging a drum but this does not mean it needs to be lacking in heart just because it is not a Michael Moore polemic. The lack of heart does not come from the subject but rather the delivery; it is a bit all over the place and I&apos;m not entirely sure what some section were designed to achieve  a tasting in Starbucks seems like time wasted in an already short run time.\n\nOverall then this is a so-so film but given the subject and the plight of the growers, even the kindest viewer would admit this film is more missed potential than delivery. Positive reviews tend to praise it for its intension and I do not begrudge them this. The proof though, is in the pudding and that is where the film should be judged. Sadly it is poorly structure and doesn&apos;t ever get a handle on the subject in a way that isn&apos;t that compelling or challenging  and considering everything that is a shocking failure."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been a while since I wrote one of these but thanks mainly to Owen Wilson for another hilarious (yes and interchangeable) role, this movie was funny enough to get motivated once again.\n\nThe premise is obviously pretty simple and has been done before in both bodyguard and teen movies (Superbad and My Bodyguard come to mind...duh). The beauty of this movie it combines the two genres with Owen Wilson&apos;s natural comedic talent and three capable younger actors resulting in a mostly funny comedy that is unique from the rest.\n\nThere was an interesting metaphor contained in one of the trailers showing Drillbit telling the kids he&apos;s taking them under his wing. The reason I say this is interesting is because this is how it mostly worked for the movie&apos;s humor. It took almost 15 minutes for it to really get started. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there were some funny parts that didn&apos;t involve him like the bodyguard interviews (gotta love Frank Whaley&apos;s cameo), Ryan&apos;s rap off with the bully and the two hitting each other but the biggest laughs for me were from Owen Wilson. To be fair though, Owen was at his best when the kids were involved. I loved the way he approached this &quot;job&quot; with one part seriousness, one part B.S. and two parts hilarious. I was dying when he was holding up that kid&apos;s burning popsicle stick project up to the sprinklers and just the general training conversations just to illustrate that recipe.\n\nOverall, this storyline was nothing brilliant but as in You Me and Dupree, Owen Wilson manages to take something that could be rather mediocre turning it into an enjoyable and endearing comedy. True, he really didn&apos;t do it by himself as I&apos;d try to make you believe. I mean the way the bullies were portrayed was a very convincing and effective factor that helped sell this one as well and who could forget the lovely Leslie Mann in an interesting and sometimes funny romantic subplot. To sum it all up, if you liked the trailers you&apos;re going to like this movie. And a shout to all the people who replied in my thread that convinced me to go myself. You were right."

      "reviewBody": "I like true crime films. I work in the legal field, myself. I was surprised this film did almost nothing to show how the case was presented, although the Force/Mass testimony would have been very compelling to the jury; I&apos;m sure what they saw and heard was much more thorough.\n\nBeing from 2008, this film was part of the struggle to pull the covers on this type of brutality and cover-up. We now have Minnesota v. Chauvin, which is a real turning point in our communities for all citizens who&apos;ve been victimized by rouge cops like Derek who was reported several times by fellow cops and abused civilians before finally committing this unforgivable act. This verdict is a direct result of unreported footwork by the orange guy who implemented police reform as soon as the death of GF was announced.\n\nThe difference with the Thacker case is that, as the attorney claims, the FBI eventually pardoned the convicted cops. Well, I&apos;m not a trial attorney but I can tell you that only the POTUS can Pardon a murderer; and a pardon in no way reverses the legal conclusion of the courts or expunges a judgment. The FBI is the one who investigates petitions for pardon. Once it has concluded the investigation, they submit it to the office of the President without prejudice.\n\nThe attorney, who wrote this film and has various blogs around the internet, claims his intent was to show FBI corruption but this film never touches on that except a footnote at the end. Researching his blogs identifies his main complaint as being that there was no grand jury and no trial supporting the pardon, and that they created false evidence, which the writer does not elaborate on.\n\nNone of this is required in a pardon.\n\nThe truth is, civilians don&apos;t have the clearance to know why the FBI do what they do. People call the FBI criminals all the time because they take laws that apply to civilians and apply them to this huge leg of Homeland Security. For all we know, the conviction prevented them from continuing to employ one or more of the cops as some kind of informants or agents. I seriously doubt it was just to get the best donuts when they visit Iowa, but in 1989 it very well could have simply been to show support to the police. It was a different time.\n\nI feel the attorney is doing a disservice to his late client and the ground-breaking verdict he secured by making this now about some imagined FBI corruption. He should research how a pardon is processed and stop blaming the investigative branch that handled the paperwork.",

Although this Oscar winning film is fairly well crafted, it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities. Much of the film&apos;s 1.7 hour run time is get on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, get off the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, etc.; time which could have been better spent or left out completely. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. A worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but over-rated.",

Even though I don&apos;t know what it is like to have a distance or missing parent, I feel I&apos;ve suffered the same feelings that other children in this situation must have.\n\nThe emotional content of the film continues if you watch the documentary on the making of the film included in the DVDs extras. This is no ordinary film; the feelings of the director, the cinematographer, the producer, and the personal experiences of each of the actors; words cannot describe the heart every single person put into this film. The insufficiency of words can also be described by the film itself -there isn&apos;t a heavy amount of dialogue, and there doesn&apos;t need to be (even though for the majority of the film you&apos;re screaming at the characters to say something!). To quote from Fyodor Dostoyevsky (a Russian author): &quot;there is immeasurably more left inside than what comes out in words.&quot;\n\nThis little review doesn&apos;t do justice to the film for the same reason. It is for this reason, this insufficiency that words have, why films (like this one) need to be created.",

When I was reading the play, I could not picture myself the king. Yet when I saw Leonov, it became obvious that he is the perfect actor to play the king.\n\nAfter all, this is not a movie about an adventure, but about people, their reactions, their feelings.",

      "reviewBody": "Playing would-be social butterfly Millie in Robert Altman&apos;s often-inscrutable &quot;3 Women&quot;, Shelley Duvall creates an amazing, amusing, totally original character. Millie fancies herself a great caregiver at a job where others regard her as nothing; she talks about her neighbors and activities as if she&apos;s Sally Bowles, when actually nobody notices her. She&apos;s pathetic, but Duvall makes her funny and quirky (and Altman is careful not to make too much fun of her). Sissy Spacek as roommate Pinky is also fine in a less-showy, less-complex role, but her transformation in the second-half shows off her range. The film is slow but not dull, confusing but not off-putting (despite fuzzy cinematography). The one thing I really objected to was the ending, which plays like Greek tragedy mixed with Tennessee Williams. Nobody has dared to make another film like &quot;3 Women&quot;. Altman-protégé Alan Rudolph captured some of its eccentric quality in &quot;Welcome to L.A.&quot;, but his script wasn&apos;t clever enough. The writing here may seem simple, but this turns out to be deceptive: the dialogue is pungent with the ring of absurd truth. It took me a while to reconcile my feelings for this film. As soon as I decided how I felt about it, I couldn&apos;t wait to see it again. *** from ****",

From the G-string of a stripper at a Bachelor&apos;s party to the hands of a ten year old in a fishing contest to the frantic hands of a homeless woman with Lottery winnings in mind - this bill&apos;s journey is surprising and hilarious. The stories around the main idea abound and are far from dull. Christopher Lloyd and Steve Buscemi&apos;s scenes are, in my opinion, the highlight of this film. I&apos;ve never understood why this movie is so wildly underrated. I&apos;ve never come across any acquaintance that has seen it when I ask. If you get the chance, watch it, you won&apos;t be disappointed."

Using time-lapse photography, multiple exposures, animation, and other computer-controlled optical effects, director Pat O&apos;Neill takes the viewer on a hypnotic tour of the Southern California power grid, exploring the collision between humankind and nature with a dazzling array of playful and enigmatic images. The film is a (strictly non-narrative) visual showcase, but what might have been merely a technical exercise in virtuoso FX wizardry becomes an exciting and challenging work of art, combining a sophisticated, choreographed sound track, several comic visual juxtapositions (including segments from old Hollywood movies such as Cecil B. DeMille&apos;s &apos;The Ten Commandments&apos;), and odd inter-title story fragments.",

Is it because it&apos;s R-rated?  That&apos;s a lot of it, but it also has a good pedigree. \n\n Director/co-writer Wilson also created TV&apos;s &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, Israel and Proft have written &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; and some other funny stuff you may have heard of (they had a hand in the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; films).\n\nAnd the cast, in this instance, is fresh!  Guttenberg has seldom been better, nor has Cattrall (well, maybe except for &quot;Porky&apos;s&quot;), Gaynes, Bailey, Smith, Winslow or Easterbrook.  There are a handful of good lines, more good scenes here than in any four of the sequels you can name and plenty more opportunity for good old raunchy &quot;Animal House&quot;-style guffaws.\n\nYou don&apos;t believe me?  Think about the scene with the hooker (Spelvin) in the speaker&apos;s podium.  Then think about the punch line (&quot;Good speech.&quot;). You see?  Ah, memories.\n\nTake it from a hard-bitten veteran of the series.  This is as good as it gets.  You want to see a funny movie about cops?  Register at your local &quot;Police Academy&quot;.\n\nSix stars, plus a star more for Guttenberg&apos;s final scene. Classic.",

Admittedly, I was a huge Edgar Rice Burroughs fan as a kid, but I&apos;m not sure that didn&apos;t prime me to dislike the movie.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t a big budget movie, but I think the money they had was well spent. The special effects were not the center of the film but they didn&apos;t detract from the story either. The acting was surprisingly unembarrassing and I personally found the dialog very good. The updating of the story was subtle and funny.\n\nOne of the other reviewers said this isn&apos;t the film we were waiting for, and I suppose that&apos; right. It is, though, the film we got. All in all, it struck me as a sincere labor of love that did credit to the memory of Burroughs himself, the master of the pulps."

      "reviewBody": "Tennessee Williams was a stunning writer for the theater... The impact of his plays can overwhelm an audience with its superior force...\n\nWritten in 1957, &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; is a reconstruction of Williams&apos; 1940 &quot;Battle of Angels,&quot; filmed under Sidney Lumet&apos;s direction as &quot;The Fugitive Kind.&quot;\n\nWilliams subtracted elements of the ancient myth of Orpheus and Euridice to examine the sadistically patriarchal Southern Gothic town and to create a violent plot, involving ruined love, weakness, sex, betrayal, vengeance and lingering hatreds... &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; shows how social prejudice threatens the lives of identified outsiders...\n\nThis classic play is not quite his masterpiece... &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; is... It lacks some of the regretful charm of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and the entire impact of &quot;Cat On a Hot Tin Roof.&quot; Nevertheless it is a deeply moving work of art...\n\nWilliams was known for his compelling dialog and themes that - for their time - often seemed strange or shocking... He vividly suggested the sexual tensions and prevented violence of his tormented character, usually with compassion as well as irony...\n\nThe film focuses on a handsome drifter from New Orleans, named Val Xavier, wearing a snake skin jacket - Williams&apos; trademark of a rebel, non-conformist - Val is a &quot;fugitive kind&quot; who comes in off the highway... He is a rural Orpheus who descends to rescue his love, not in Hades precisely, but among the intrigue, chatter, and violence of the hot-tempered town of Two Rivers, Mississippi... He is a wandering guitar player who embarks on an affair with a lonely frustrated unhappy storekeeper&apos;s wife Lady Torrance...\n\nAnna Magnani is intelligently sensual and charming as Lady... Joanne Woodward is the hungry grotesque drunken Carol who tries to seduce Val in a cemetery... Both women are so intense, that they force you to become involved with them...\n\nThe genuine community provides also interesting watching: Victor Jory, positively magnetic as the brutal oppressive husband Jabe Torrence; the vindictive sheriff R. G. Armstrong; and the soft-hearted Vee (Maureen Stapleton).\n\nLady Torrence is a study of the immigrant woman who has acquired a patina of resilient toughness but who slowly admits her sensuality... She catches perfectly contradictory emotions of one who is wary of the stranger but who longs for his healing touch...\n\nWith handsome magnetism, Brando is no less compelling... He is quite convincing avoiding all the clichés of the drifting Don Juan... With some kind of lucid intensity, he mixes his character&apos;s predatory and uncivil arrogance with flashes of sweet tenderness...\n\nThe film (definitely worth seeing) is extremely poignant and captivating... The direction is excellent and the action moves very smoothly, never allowing you to relax...",

She also delivers a graceful physical performance, but the film on the whole is disappointingly short on martial arts action and long on gunplay. Another disappointment is that Xin Xin Xiong (probably the best martial artist in the film) and the incredibly cute Hilary Tsui are underused, and yet another one is that Michelle never appears in the fishnet lingerie that she wears on the DVD cover! Much like another Ching Siu Tung film I saw recently, Jet Li&apos;s &quot;Dr. Wai and the Scripture with No Words&quot;, there is a lot of activity here, but not all of it is engaging and the story is confusing in spots, though there are occasional moments of inspired action (an elevator shaft launched onto a helicopter - now that is something I&apos;ve never seen before!). Overall, &quot;Wonder Seven&quot; is not a must-see by any means, unless of course you just want to see Michelle Yeoh looking better than ever. (**)",

John McClane, a New York police officer, who has been invited to the wrong Christmas party.\n\nThis is an action film for future actors and directors to watch and use as a model because it is what an action film should be. I have seen many action films in my life, but this ranks at the top as it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.\n\n&quot;Die Hard&quot; is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.\n\n&quot;Die Hard&quot; did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who starred in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series &quot;Family Matters.&quot; These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.\n\nTwo other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said &apos;Okay boys, watch out I&apos;m taking over.&quot; They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10; &quot;Die Hard&quot; is given a 100 by yours truly. My only regret would be that the movie ended. I wish there was more to see in this film. I CAN&apos;T WAIT TO SEE &quot;DIE HARD&quot; AGAIN."

This is a guy that was known for his epic, exhausting live shows -- he even tells the crowd in this one that it will be a long one so they should get comfortable -- yet we get less than an hour of music here! This thing could&apos;ve easily been 3 hours and I would&apos;ve been thrilled because that&apos;s how fun, energetic and incredible this particular band is. If you&apos;ve seen &quot;Roxy&quot; you saw a totally different type of Zappa band because this one is much more of a rock outfit that can zip through entire medleys at top tempo, never once missing a note and with each member displaying a ton of personality. In fact, I&apos;d say Frank actually has the most boring stage presence of anyone in this film, and that&apos;s saying something! I found the interview segments to be distracting and they made Zappa even less endearing. The audio mix isn&apos;t as clear for every instrument as &quot;Roxy&quot; is (some of the drum parts get lost) but the guitars sound incredible and are way in your face. If this one had been a little more focused on the music and documenting an entire show it would easily be a 10/10 but it&apos;s still a must watch for any Zappa fan as it is.",

      "reviewBody": "Fun and amusing comedy about a pair of down-and-out fortune hunters cash in on high adventure . As a duo of adventurers , Max Donigan (Chuck Norris) along with his friend Leo (Louis Gosset Jr) set off on a treasure hunt . Both of whom are hired by a gorgeous girl called Patricia (Melody Anderson of Flash Gordon , whose hair perfectly intact throughout) . The girl and mercenaries set out in search for a treasure she&apos;s imagined exists . Along the way the way , they kill Native Americans attempting to protect sacred Indian grounds . The trio confront risks , dangers and other obstacles until achieve their objective . All of them try to track down an ancient Aztec/Mayan/Egyptian/ Apache horde of gold as they end up in a Mayan temple of Doom besieged by Coyote (Sonny Landham) .\n\nThis is an average quality film plenty of adventures , brawls , fun scenes , a few bar fights , humor with tongue in cheek , fantasy and results to be amusing ; however , some moments being boring . Chuck Norris character is a blending between known Indiana Jones and his popular role as a tough , two-fisted man and fellow mercenary played Louis Gosset -not too distant Oscar winner for ¨An official and a gentleman¨- is very well . Both of them have great chemical as a duo of soldiers-of-wacky misfortune who take several dangers that are able to overcome with ease . In a hand , if you enjoy funny stories and have a soft spot for attractive characters and scenarios, you are in for a great one ; in other hand if you don&apos;t like Norris kicks , silly humor and bemusing situations , then this one will not be for you and get bored . Passable production , medium budget by Cannon films , Menahem Golan-Yoram Globus , and poorly realized . Producers left room for sequel but as a box office failure was never carried out . This is Aaron Norris&apos; , Chuck Norris&apos; brother, last film as a stunt coordinator , he began his career as a director with his next film, his brother&apos;s Braddock: Missing in action 3 (1988) . Anti-climatic musical score by Gary Chang , being composed by means of synthesizer . Atmospheric though dark cinematography by Alex Phillips filmed on location in Durango , Morelos, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico Torreón, Coahuíla, and Churubasco Distrito Federal , Mexico .\n\nThe fare was regularly directed by J. Lee Thomson . He previously had a nice track record in the English cinema from 1950 until 1961 , directing good Western ( McKenna&apos;s gold , White Buffalo) and all king genres as Sci-Fi (Conquest and Battle of planet of apes), terror (reincarnation of Peter Proud, Eye of the devil), adventures (Flame over India ,Kings of the sun, Taras Bulba , Tiger Bay) and Warlike ( Guns of Navarone, Von Braun , Chairman , The passage). His two biggest successes turn out to be ¨Guns of Navarone¨and ¨Cape Fear¨. Thereafter , the filmmaker&apos;s career subsided in a morass of slickly realized but middling films. He moved into the field of international spectaculars , at which point his filmmaking seemed to lose its individuality . J. Lee Thomson working from the 50s in England, finished his career making Chuck Norris (Firewalker) and Charles Bronson vehicles (Caboblanco, Evil that men do, Messenger of death, Death Wish 4 : Crackdown, Caboblanco, St Ives). Firewalker rating : Mediocre , but it will appeal to Chuck Norris fans .",

But instead of at that pivotal moment when one comes of age, Jerome the aspiring artist turns to the dark side and begins to show someone with genuine ambition and a worthy character descend into a turbulent test of artistic innovation. Whatever the hell that means. &apos;Art School&apos; not only depicts the individual growth of Jerome, but also analyzes the definition of art, and in some respects, defines it quite well. Why does shitty art get so much acclaim? Why does quality art often go unnoticed? Why are artists such pretentious ass holes? The whole movie answers all these questions hilariously and beautifully.",

      "reviewBody": "The Devil Wears Prada (2006)\n\nThere are four and a half major stars here, and any part of this movie with any of them is really fabulous. I&apos;m talking Streep of course, and Hathaway who has the main role. Add Tucci who is terrific (as always) and Blunt who is also terrific (as always) and you have he makings of a terrific movie.\n\nSo why the downer reviews and semi-dud status? I don&apos;t know, except the other parts without any of these, or with just Hathaway and her friends (her peers including her cute but dull boyfriend) are really dull stuff. This is partly the actors and partly the writing, which is truly filler. I can see some people grabbing their remotes at these points. \n\nBut let&apos;s get to the crux of the movie, which is actually pretty great fun. The parade of great fashion that whizzes by, the haughty power queen that Streep pulls off with such panache, the steady dribble of insults coming from Blunt&apos;s mouth, and the transformation of Hathaway, over and over, as she moves her way into this world are all really dazzling. It&apos;s a fairy tale with its feet firmly on the ground--but what odd, worldly, glitzed up ground to be standing on. \n\nThere are no depths here, just light romantic comedy. It&apos;s a situation many of us know--either by having to look good, or by having an impossible boss, or just seeing a relationship dissolve as you move on in your goals and maturity. Between the dreck there is a mostly wonderful idea made into an intermittently wonderful film.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit that I don&apos;t expect much from a Roger Corman film.  Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts.  Yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky Beverly Garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered.  Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband&apos;s funeral.  Her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew.  The bar&apos;s owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the (hoped-for) railroad.  However, Ms. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar matron hires a man to kill Ms. Garland.\n\nBecause of Ms. Garland&apos;s plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers &quot;She&apos;s the Sheriff&quot; jokes. With the exception of a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens OUT from the inside, jeep tracks, and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner), the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare.  However, Corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes, much like he does walking in other films.\n\nSterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time.",

Nothing more than a funny and cool romantic comedy with subtle slashes of a different action because of the &apos;breaking relationships&apos; plot, always in a soft touch. I point out the chemistry between the two main actors, one of the film&apos;s main qualities, and specially Romain Duris that is becoming an essential actor of french contemporary cinema, commercial as independent.\n\nA &apos;feel-good&apos; movie destined to amuse the public and that achieves well his mission in a dynamic and pleasuring way - 6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Here is a grand epic in the scale of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, and &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;. It is the best movie I&apos;ve seen this year, and more than that, it was one of the most amazing film experiences of my life.\n\nIt is Caroline Link&apos;s &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot;, which won the Best Foreign Film Award when, in actuality, it was far better than the Best Picture of the Year. To call it a great or brilliant or majestic film is an understatement; in fact, I&apos;m at a loss for adjectives to describe it.\n\nThe film tells the story of a German Jewish woman and her young daughter summoned to Kenya by her husband, circa. 1938. Adolf Hitler is on the brink of declaring his &quot;final solution&quot; of the Jews, and it is with great luck that Jettel and young Regina escape.\n\nIn Africa, they adapt slowly to their new rural life. While Regina befriends cook Owuor, Walter and Jettel&apos;s relationship threatens to destroy itself because of the hardships the family encounters.\n\nI will not spend too much time going into detail, for watching this masterful story unfold is a treasure in itself. This film is based on an autobiography by Stephanie Zweig, and when it is available in English, I will certainly read it.\n\nAlso, the language in this movie is truly beautiful. I saw &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot; again, just days after watching it for the first time, and spent more time ignoring the subtitles and listening to the beautiful spoken German. \n\nAnd then there is one scene toward the end that I simply could not believe. It involves a locust invasion, and, quite simply, it was the first time I&apos;ve ever seen something on the screen and asked myself aloud (as I did the first viewing), &quot;How did they do that?&quot; \n\nThe performances here are first-rate, too.  Julianne Kohler, who was wonderful in the ultra-weird &quot;Aimee &amp; Junger&quot; is perfect; we understand this woman fully, even when she doesn&apos;t speak. Merab Ninidze has some great scenes with Walter, the father; and Sidede Onyulo is simply magical as Owuor.\n\nBut the movie belongs to the two girls who play Regina. They look amazingly similar, and they are both stellar. Lea Kurka brings much hope as the adorable young Regina, and Karoline Eckertz is subtle and remarkable as the older Regina, particularly in a heartbreaking exchange with her father at her school.\n\nIt would be a shame to miss this film. No, it would be more than a shame. It would be downright wrong and discouraging. This film, along with the wonderful &quot;Whale Rider&quot; are two remarkable international films that bring beauty, grace, and majesty to the screen, and are perfect for adults and older children.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the famous Traver novel, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is an extremely complex film that defeats easy definition. In some respects it is a social document of the era in which it was made; primarily, however, it is a detailed portrait of the law at work and the mechanizations and motivations of the individuals involved in a seemingly straight-forward case. In the process it raises certain ethical issues re attorney behavior and the lengths to which an attorney might go to win a case.\n\nPaul Biegler (James Stewart) is a small-town lawyer who has recently lost a re-election for the position of District Attorney and who is down on his luck--when a headline-making case involving assault, alleged rape, and murder drops into his lap. As the case evolves, there is no question about the identity of the killer. But a smart lawyer might be able to get him off just the same and redeem his own career in the process, and with the aid of an old friend (Arthur O&apos;Connell) and his formidable secretary (Eve Arden), Biegler sets out to do precisely that. Opposing him in the courtroom is Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a high powered prosecutor who is equally determined to get a conviction... and who is no more adverse to coaching a witness than Biegler himself. The two square off in a constantly shifting battle for the jury, a battle that often consists of underhanded tactics on both sides.\n\nThe performances are impressive, with James Stewart ideally cast as the attorney for the defense, Ben Gazzara as his unsavory client, and a truly brilliant Lee Remick as the sexy and disreputable wife who screams rape where just possibly none occurred; O&apos;Connell, Arden, and Scott also offer superior performances. The script is sharp, cool, and meticulous, the direction and cinematography both effective and completely unobtrusive, and the famous jazz score adds quite a bit to the film as a whole.\n\nAlthough we can&apos;t help rooting for Stewart, as the film progresses it seems more and more likely that Remick is lying through her teeth and Gazzara is as guilty as sin--but the film balances its elements in such a way as to achieve a disturbing ambiguity that continues right through to the end. If you expect a courtroom thriller with sudden revelations and twists you&apos;ll likely be disappointed in ANATOMY OF A MURDER, but if you want a thought-provoking take on the law you&apos;d be hard pressed to find one better. Recommended.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

David Warner plays a determined scientist, Kathryn Harrold is Mancuso&apos;s love interest who narrowly escapes the wrath of the bats. the highlight of the film is the sequence with the bigoted evangelists whilst camping in the outback meet a nasty end courtesy of the winged creatures. &apos;Nightwing&apos; is an enjoyable Nature gone berserk movie which despite it&apos;s shortcomings is great fun. Henry Mancini&apos;s score is excellent."

      "reviewBody": "An interesting film from the period in Italy when there was a call for more realist type of filmmaking (rather than escapist) which eventually resulted in Italy&apos;s great Neo-Realist era.\n\nCesare (Fosco Giachetti), a long-distance truck driver separates from his young wife Anna (Mariella Lotti) after an argument during which she complains of being too lonely. Angry and withdrawn he goes about life mechanically until one day he meets Piera (Luisa Ferida) and he falls in love. But will this new love last?\n\nThere is some good location shooting, mostly along the Ligurian coast between Savona and La Spezia which is mixed with some studio shots for the interior scenes. Overall, it&apos;s a competently made film.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the film is the presence of Luisa Ferida. A leading actress during the Fascist era, she followed the Mussolini clan along with her lover and fellow actor Osvaldo Valenti when the republic of Salo&apos; was formed in Northern Italy after the Nazis had rescued Mussolini from prison. Three years after this film was made, Ferida and Valenti were executed by the Partisans after a summary trial for alleged association with a Fascist torturing gang. This association was later disproved. It appears that the Partisans seeking revenge for years of persecution at the hands of the fascists were a little too-trigger happy on several occasions and the Ferida/Valenti charges were just concocted to justify the execution.",

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of science fiction allegory, social experiment, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and the thriller genre -- no less all those elements combined -- Richard Kelly and his film &quot;The Box&quot; should&apos;ve at least won me over, but it doesn&apos;t. It can&apos;t even decide if it wants to remain completely mysterious or explicitly tell us what&apos;s going on and any film that has to contemplate that is too complex for its own good. \n\nWith any story this daring, there&apos;s potential for something meaningful. &quot;The Box&quot; does let you glimpse it and draw a few interesting conclusions, but through intellectual jail bars placed before our eyes by the myriad of plot contrivances. In other words, too many plot elements exist in in the film that keep us from ever putting our mind around what Kelly is trying to say. Although he starts simply by focusing on a couple (James Marsden and Cameron Diaz) and their child making an ethical decision, the scope widens to include everything from Arthur C. Clarke references to mindless drones to some indiscernible notion of the afterlife.\n\nThis beginning piece is based on Richard Matheson&apos;s story &quot;Button, Button,&quot; which was a short story turned into a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode. In &quot;The Box,&quot; a mysterious man with a half-burned face played by Frank Langella drops off a box with a button in it at the doorstep of Norma and Arthur Lewis and their son Walter. He later comes back and gives Norma a proposition: don&apos;t press the button and nothing happens, or press the button and receive one million dollars and subsequently someone, anywhere in the world, whom they don&apos;t know will die.\n\nWell, Norma, a teacher, just lost her teacher tuition discount for her son and Arthur&apos;s application to be an astronaut was just denied and despite living in a nice looking house in Richmond, Virginia they apparently have no money, so it&apos;s not hard to figure out ultimately what they&apos;ll do. After all, don&apos;t press the button and there&apos;s no film -- not that some people who sit through this would&apos;ve minded that in retrospect.\n\nAs with his cult hit &quot;Donnie Darko,&quot; Kelly keeps &quot;The Box&quot; fascinatingly creepy. It starts with the colors, the classic string soundtrack from the band Arcade Fire and some peculiar Easter eggs and moves on to more jarring occurrences. There is never a point where things get so absurd that you don&apos;t care what happens in the end, even if there&apos;s a chance the end could be terribly unsatisfying. It&apos;s one of few saving graces for &quot;The Box,&quot; but perhaps even this is only for those intrigued by high concept sci-fi mystery that parallels human nature no matter how vague.\n\nWhen any thriller collapses somewhere after the midway point, you can usually blame the fact that too many occurrences in need of explaining were written in order for the writer to achieve his desired end. When James Marsden gets hit in a car by a truck and comes out of a giant light warehouse and that ultimately never gets explained, its degrading to the viewer.\n\nThe real trouble with &quot;The Box&quot; is how ambitiously it tries to combine the ideas of intelligent life/space exploration with religious notions of life, death and what might come after as well as numerous other elements too many and too difficult to explain. Kelly found that balance between time travel and inter-relationship drama in &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; but &quot;The Box&quot; implodes on itself by severing its little social experiment from the characters with too much unexplained phenomena.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

I didn&apos;t know much about the plot going in, so some of the twists towards the end were a little unexpected for me.

It was enjoyable to see the characters we love deal with the inevitabilities of aging and the fierce loyalty of friendship. Some of the mystery is gone and it feels like a pair of comfortable shoes. But aren&apos;t those shoes your favorite ones? It was interesting to see the development of Lorna and Riggs&apos; relationship, as well as the growing up of the Murtaugh kids. It makes you feel like you&apos;re catching up with old friends at a reunion! Plenty of action and the incredible work of Jet Li make this movie a favorite at my house. Overall, a great wrap-up to the series and a lot of fun for long time fans. Worth seeing! If the language is a real issue, watch for it on TNT and enjoy the edited version.",

The 8 year old kid, a football fan in this small African village realizes he needs to work 750 days to pay for a proper leather football. He breaks down. The doctor (Agnes Soral) in charge of the humanitarian hospital of the area decides to make him a big surprise: she brings a football back from one of her trips to Europe. The kids of he village obsessed with the fame of the Golden Ball trophy paint the ball with golden paint. Will Bandian (the kid) make it to Europe? The film depicts what must have been the youth of many a football legend. They enchant the pitches of Europe every week-end and the tabloids write about their salaries and their love lives. But where do these African stars come from? The Golden Ball gives us hints and shows the incredible obstacles these heroes of the beautiful game had to overcome to make it. A wonderful film for families and sports fans."

Hit girl tries to balance her life as a student which is a very realstick approach and I liked it a lot! There is a team of superheroes led by Colonel Stars and Stripes played by Jim Carrey who totally pulled it off! The movie had emotional scenes and intense elements just like previous part! If u liked Kick ass 1 , you will definitely love this fantabulous sequel! Truly , it is a stupendous sequel of a meritorious movie!",

      "name": "A different &quot;Hair&quot;-style than the stage version, but still good.",
      "reviewBody": "The stage play &quot;Hair&quot; is primarily remembered now for two things....its shocking frankness and its music.  In bringing the musical to the big screen (belatedly), the bulk of the stage version&apos;s loose plot was discarded and a more conventional storyline was created to link the songs together.  This seems to either please or alienate people, depending on their relationship to the original show.  In any case, the great majority of the songs are retained in this filmization which is more than can be said for many, many stage to screen adaptations.  And what music!  In most cases, the vocalizing even exceeds the quality of what could be found onstage, though the authenticity of the performers is obviously forsaken somewhat as the original cast was LIVING this at the time they were in the show.  The film&apos;s plot concerns an Oklahoma farm boy (Savage) who&apos;s on his way to report for active military duty during Vietnam.  He is waylaid in Central Park by a clatch of hippies led by Williams.  He also spies the girl of his dreams (D&apos;Angelo), a debutante who rides by on horseback in the midst of all the free love gyrations taking place in the park.  The rest of the movie concerns the connections of these characters as they experience culture clash, sharing, understanding and even love.  There is copious drug use and rebellion against the wealthy along with hallucinogenic dancing and skinny dipping.  Eventually, one character makes a gesture for another which winds up costing more than could ever have been imagined.  This moment makes for a hugely poignant ending to what is mostly a light-hearted and ebullient film. True, more than a little of the original subject matter has been tossed aside, but the filmmakers must be credited for (almost) successfully weaving a story around the songs (which are quite varied in their style and content.)  The story fails with regard to creating a believable bond between Savage and D&apos;Angelo that would endure the way it does in the story.  They hardly spend any time together in the bulk of the film (and quarrel a lot during that!), yet supposedly have this amazing love.  &quot;Aquarius&quot; gets the movie to a rousing, eye-opening start and it&apos;s just the beginning of many striking, effervescent musical moments in the show.  Oddly, the one song that is badly arranged, poorly sung and just basically mangled is the title number!  Most of the rest are excellent.  NOTHING is better than complete unknown Barnes&apos; rendition of &quot;Easy to be Hard&quot;.  She knocks the song completely out of the ball park and, sadly and inexplicably, her career went nowhere.  Williams is, at times, deliriously sexy here.  He comes off as annoyingly arrogant and stubborn at first, but eventually wins the audience over with his innate charm and vibrant talent.  As the movie nears it&apos;s close, he soars into the hunk stratosphere when, ironically, he cuts his hair.  Savage doesn&apos;t come off at all like an Oklahoman, but manages to display the contrast of his and Williams&apos; characters.  He does an adequate job in all departments throughout.  D&apos;Angelo (two years after her jaw-dropping role in &quot;The Sentinel&quot;!) is hardly debutante material and comes off as icy much of the time, but she has her moments as well.  Chapin does a bang up job as her brother.  The remainder of the hippie gang are acquired tastes.  Wright does pretty well, but went nowhere after this.  Golden just looks dazed and chews gum incessantly.  Dacus is quite weak and does little to enhance the film.  What&apos;s surprising is how a film that contains lengthy shots of bare breasts, male rear ends (and even split second male frontal nudity) was considered benign enough to warrant a PG rating, yet now, nearly 25 years later, America seems to still have a Puritanical viewpoint towards the human body when compared to other countries.  The tide has turned backward from the free love and self-expression era (except in trash like &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; and &quot;Howard Stern&quot;.)"

      "reviewBody": "I was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of &quot;Girlfight&quot;. It&apos;s an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good, but not this good.\n\nPlaced in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-do-day struggles of urban Latinos.  Diana, the protagonist, is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers, getting in trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who appears to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based double standard on his children. The father&apos;s double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny doesn&apos;t like boxing, so he and Diana trade places; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place.\n\nThis is actually a feel-good movie, as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues head-on. There&apos;s no giggly, &apos;everything that can go right does go right&apos; resolution a la &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;. The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, &quot;Girlfight&quot; is a better and more satisfying film for it.",

WTF!!!!!!!! \n\nI have been unable to find a single honest review on the internet of this film, unless you really believe it is a 10/10 shockfest, the most amazing, sick, romantic, gory, dramatic, life changing event of the century then I suggest you stay away."

Though it was not a box office success but was appreciated. If you feel like watching some thing from 80&apos;s when bollywood usually made thrash in the name of movies you may like it. It is slow but in between it is interesting. Many of the shots are shot on real location and this movies can match movies of 2022.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; is a fairly unknown little movie from director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and &quot;East of Eden&quot;. Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947, before this movie, so he was not a completely unknown at the time. Still &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; is mostly a movie that passed under the radar.\n\nThe great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script. It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film-noir elements. The dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility.\n\nThe cast is fairly unknown (especially at the time it was released) but it still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first movie roles. Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful looking face.\n\nStill the movie drags a little at some points. The movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from.\n\nYet, &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; remains a perfectly watchable movie, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch. For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

That said this movie is still a bloody good time that was better than expected.\n\nSilent Night is about a killer Santa who is unleashing his wrath on Christmas Eve. It&apos;s up to the local law enforcement to stop him.\n\nOverall Silent Night is a fun movie. It&apos;s got a lot of violence and gore, moves at a good pace, and pays homage to the first two films. Overall if you want a fun Christmas slasher, check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "Along with Marius, La Femme du boulanger is at the top of the list of Pagnol&apos;s films, which is to say that it is among the best films ever made. (This is not just my opinion; evidently Orson Welles said the same thing.) It is a &quot;typical&quot; Pagnol film, in that the plot is rudimentary at best. All the interest is the characters and their dialogue. And, despite very good performances by several of the supporting characters, this film achieves greatness because of the dialogue Pagnol gave Aimable (the baker) and the way Raimu delivers it. A mixture of the most moving pathos and the funniest comedy, the Baker is one of the great characters in film. (Trust me, the chapter in Giono&apos;s novel that served as the ostensible &quot;inspiration&quot; for this story is negligible. The genius is all Pagnol&apos;s.) The scene that every Frenchman knows is the last one, when Aimable takes out his anger at his wife&apos;s infidelity on their cat, Pomponette, but that is an atypical moment in this movie. It is all about Aimable&apos;s suffering, at the hands of his wife but also as a result of the way the town treats him. And Raimu conveys that suffering as only the greatest actors have: with understatement.\n\nMarius is funnier and has greater variety of character. But La Femme du boulanger shows what a great director and screenwriter can do with great actors. Movies get no better than this.",

Showcasing the &quot;femme fatale&quot; category comes this European cult classic, and I&apos;m glad to find it better than most....as long as it&apos;s not an action-adventure feature filled with lurid junk. Sex and eroticism aside, the feminist vampire idea actually works and does deliver extensive chills to make it worth the late-night shift. As horrifying as it sounds, it is effectively bloody and doesn&apos;t keep you away from the occuring eroticism. While we have the sensation of being in the dark and shivering in our seats, the movie sometimes doesn&apos;t know where to turn. A lot of wandering around creates confusion and lessens the full feeling of eeriness. I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;ve seen the Hammer movies, and neither have I, but there&apos;s enough in VAMPYRES to satisfy your blood-curled taste for fear. I&apos;d be dead wrong to hate movies that have loads of sex. This one counts, and because it has the right type of atmosphere. Good for its kind.",

      "name": "Spaghetti with Paella Western co-produced between Spain and Italy , filled with violence and shootouts",
      "reviewBody": "Finished Civil War and after fighting in the North side , officer Jeff Donovan (Alan Steel or Sergio Ciani) returns home . A gang of former confederates led by Machedo (William Berger) and his hoodlums ( Frank Braña, Fernando Bilbao) lay siege to a Cavalry fort, killing everyone except for Jeff whom they torture mercilessly . Blinded by revenge, ex-Union captain Donovan and now dressed in black loses all confidence in the law and gradually becomes a deranged outlaw . Jeff doesn&apos;t hesitate to prosecute to hell Machedo , being only helped by an Union veteran (Francisco Sanz) and an Indian girl . He takes the path to a little town where resides Machedo and his band harassing them until a final fight .\n\nIt&apos;s an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Alan Steel or Sergio Ciani and his enemy , William Berger and underlings , Frank Braña and Fernando Bilbao . There is plenty of action and crossfire in the movie , guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes along with a lot of violence , including killings in cold blood . This is a mediocre Spaghetti Western with some moment entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much . Director Mario Bianchi achieved in &quot;Mi Chiamavano &apos;Requiescat&apos;&quot; or ¨Fast hand is still my name¨ possibly his best work of a modest career , with some memorable scenes and regular camera movement , such as the ending duel with surprise included and that makes only can say that this movie seems to be a passable story . \n\nSergio Ciani is the tough revenger and although he doesn&apos;t reaches the level of William Berger , as he is also quite restrained and a little wooden . He played assorted mythological demigods in cheaply-made but highly popular spectacles of the early 1960s, the actor also occasionally went by his birth name . Steel started off his beefcake run off as a body double for Reeves in both the &quot;Hercules&quot; and sequel ¨Hercules Unchained¨ and in The battle of Marathón (1959) or Giant of Marathon , in which he also had bit roles . Within a couple of years Steel was posing front-and-center in Sansone (1961) opposite another physique-minded American import, Brad Harris in the title role. On numerous occasions Steel was asked to play the legendary Greek hero, as well as the equally well-built demigods Samson and Ursus, even though the film titles often fused or confused them in their titles . Steel starred as Hercules in Hercules Against Rome, Hercules Against the Moon Men , Hercules and the Black Pirate, and Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas , the second movie mentioned being one of the only spectacles to actually incorporate science fiction into the genre . In contrast, his Hercules serves as a mere sidekick in the Zorro-like Hercules and the Masked Rider . He subsequently made Ursus, the Rebel Gladiator opposite Dan Vadis , The Fury of Hercules and Samson and the Mighty Challenge. In the late 1960s he and fellow movie Musclemen Kirk Morris and Gordon Mitchell served up &quot;spaghetti western&quot; genre . In 1976 Steel starred in and co-wrote a Robin Hood movie, and in 1979 ended his on-camera appearances with the Italian comedy Baby Love .\n\nWilliam Berger as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, former and subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . His performance is astonishing , above average to level of these films . Furthermore, appears usual secondary actors from Spaghetti/Chorizo Western as Spanish actors : Francisco Sanz , Fernando Bilbao , Frank Braña and Lorenzo Robledo as a hearse driver ; as Italian secondary players as Karin Well. Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors, dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets with lousy cinematography by Emilio Foriscot , in Eastmancolor with negative badly processed , being necessary a right remastering . Being filmed on location in Colmenar Viejo, Hoyo De Manzanares, Madrid, and Seseña, Toledo, Spain . Anti-climatic musical score by Gianni Ferrio , adding modern jazzy music along with inappropriate songs . Quentin Tarantino would take Spaghetti scores composed by Gianni Ferrio for his Inglorious bastards . \n\nThe motion picture was written and produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero who started producing ¨Il Coyote¨ and ¨The Jiusticia De Coyote¨ by Joaquin Romero Marchent with Abel Salazar and Gloria Marin . After that , he produced with his company Copercines ¨Vengeance of Zorro¨ and ¨L&apos;Ombra Di Zorro¨ (1962) by Joaquin Marchent with Frank Latimore . Eduardo Manzanos built a Western little town in Hoyo De Manzanares (Madrid) with sets by Jaime Perez Cubero and Jose Luis Galicia , today sadly disappeared just like is well shown in ¨Fast hand¨ in which the village appears old and almost scrawny ; the village was called ¨Golden City¨ where filmed several Western as the classic ¨Fistful of dollars¨ and ¨For a fistful of dollars more¨ ; furthermore there was shot : ¨Welcome Padre Murray¨ , ¨Brandy¨ , various Zorros and this one . Manzanos Brochero produced various films for Marchent brothers as Joaquin Romero Marchent : ¨Cabalgando Hacia Muerte¨ , ¨Three good men¨; and Rafael Marchent : ¨Quien Grita vengeance¨, ¨Two crosses in Danger Pass¨ ; and for Italian directors as ¨Sabor Odio¨ by Umberto Lenzi¨ , ¨Winchester 1 between 1000¨ by Primo Zeglio , ¨At the end of the rainbow¨ by Aldo Florio and ¨Taste for vengeance¨ or &quot;Cowards Don&apos;t Pray&quot; . ¨Fast Hand¨ was middlingly realized by Mario Bianchi OR Frank Bronston , son of director Roberto B. Montero . Mario Bianchi realized all kind of genres as Terror , Softcore , Hardcore and Spaghetti Western such as ¨Più forte Sorelle¨ , &quot;Kill the Poker Player&quot; , ¨The Masked Thief&quot; and this ¨Fast hand¨ , most of them written and produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero.",

He refuses to play by the rules, but has not figured out anything else that he can do or be.  He has minor escapes, via a ViewMaster, books, a girlfriend from the city, a gun to shoot icicles with, but they are not ultimately enough to keep him from going berserk.  But the tiny Icelandic village where he lives understands him, and refuses to do something so simple as to have him locked up or sent away.  Rather, they just understand, and Noi cannot get out of his dreary cold existence. \n\n The role of Noi is played by a skinny young man who looks like he&apos;s had chemo, but he&apos;s got a beautiful expressive face, which is on-screen almost all the time.  I&apos;d love to see the guy with a head of hair.  His grandmother provides great comic relief as she does her aerobics, and his dad is a vivid character down on his luck in a way that only Scandinavians can portray. He&apos;s drunk on Elvis, and that makes his life bearable.\n\nHope this movies gets releases--it&apos;s beautiful to look at, funny, sad, touching.",

A very poetic piece of political observation on how the modern person neglects what their forefathers fought for. Ugo in top form, playing both father and son!",

In addition, Kevin Spacey with his wonderful performance and entertaining sense of humor and wit made this movie a must-see. The movie doesn&apos;t want you to side with any of the three characters; it simply displays three different samples of human nature, and their views on the world (especially the concept of appearance vs reality).",

      "reviewBody": "Quentin Tarantino looks like he just might follow through with his threat to make the ultimate &quot;guys on a mission movie&quot; if he gets his &apos;Inglorious Bastards&apos; on to the big screen, but he&apos;ll be pushed to equal &apos;The Dirty Dozen&apos;, the quintessential movie in the genre. 35 years on and it&apos;s still one of the best WW2 adventure movies, and a strong contender for the ultimate guys movie. It shouldn&apos;t be taken too seriously - I don&apos;t think anyone is going to argue it&apos;s a realistic depiction of war - but it&apos;s still one of the most entertaining movies around, and it&apos;s impressive collection of tough guys and character actors is really hard to beat. Director Aldrich had previously made the classic noir &apos;Kiss Me Deadly&apos; (starring Ralph Meeker who reappears here in a supporting role) and the wonderfully creepy &apos;Whatever Happened To Baby Jane&apos;, but this is arguably going to be THE movie he&apos;s remembered for. Screen legend Lee Marvin (&apos;Point Blank&apos;, &apos;The Killers&apos;) with the assistance of his Sgt (Richard Jaeckel), must train a motley collection of criminal and misfits (including John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker and Donald Sutherland), for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Marvin is just great, extremely cool and charismatic, but also a fine actor, something which is often overlooked. The ensemble cast (which also includes George Kennedy, and two future stars of &apos;The Wild Bunch&apos;, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan) are uniformly excellent, but Cassavetes is particularly outstanding, Sutherland is memorable as a half wit, and Savalas is unforgettable as the religious psychopath Maggott. &apos;The Dirty Dozen&apos; is first class entertainment and highly recommended. It put 90% of today&apos;s &quot;action movies&quot; to shame!"

Right from the disquietening first sequence - the amateur film of Hitler&apos;s tea party - to the beautifully understated ending, the young woman&apos;s search for the only film of her dead mother, this had me spellbound.  Beautifully understated.  And that song!  I had actually read about this film before coming to see it and I was convinced it was going to be too much, but no.

The ubiquitous German 88mm, the best anti-tank gun of the war does not appear. The Americans oppose heavy German tanks with light machine guns--a recipe for suicide. The historical point is that the balance between tanks and infantry was swinging to the infantry at just this time as hand-held shaped-charge weapons appeared on both sides.\n\nBad history and an unconvincing story.",

It reminds me of my high-school time, and my friends. Geeks, rebellions, averages and excellent girls. The four main actresses are all adorable. Their performance is very convincing. It&apos;s also great that they didn&apos;t try to make every girl perfectly beautiful, just natural. \n\nSome of the details are not making perfect sense, but ignorable. I believe the psychological transition of the leading girl could have been shown more. Also, there&apos;s not exactly a leading character here, maybe a good thing, coz all the girls are truly equally likable.",

      "reviewBody": "Private School (for Girls) is a teen sex-comedy that isn&apos;t particularly funny, and doesn&apos;t feature much sex. It is, however, an 80s teen sex-comedy and, furthermore, it is an 80s teen sex-comedy that stars the most gorgeous actress to have ever graced this earth, the delicious Phoebe Cates. For these reasons, I am willing to cut the movie a lot of slack.\n\nChristine (Phoebe Cates), a student at an all girls school, is in love with Jim (Matthew Modine), who is attending a nearby academy for boys. They are planning their first night of passion together but, when busty bitch Jordan (Betsy Russell) sets her sights on Christine&apos;s guy, they find that the course of true love n&apos;er did run smooth (as some poet once wrote). Meanwhile, Jim&apos;s school buddies involve him in all sorts of crazy capers in a desperate attempt to see (and hopefully score with) as many naked babes as possible.\n\nPrivate School may not be the greatest example of its genre (I think that accolade goes to Fast Times at Ridgmont High, also starring Phoebe Cates), but it still has bags of 80s charm, a likable cast and, of course, loads of quality tits and ass on display! And although Ms. Cates keep herself mostly covered up in this movie, the vivacious Betsy Russell does her best to compensate by getting her ample charms out at the drop of a hat.\n\nViewers are also treated to a great cheesy dance routine with the girls (clad in lycra leotards and leg-warmers) bending and stretching (to the song The American Girl by Rick Springfield), a real corker of a shower scene, the unforgettable sight of a topless Ms. Russell riding a horse in slow motion, and an appearance by Emmanuelle herself, Sylvia Kristel, who, unsurprisingly, plays the sex education teacher.\n\nPrivate School is enjoyably silly trash for those who love immature teen comedies with loads of nudity (ie., me!).",

      "reviewBody": "I know I should, but I don&apos;t watch many documentaries. It&apos;s a different world inside of film-making, one in which everything is, among other things, real. Another feeling that a documentary generates is immediacy; a sensation of present time even if it&apos;s telling something that&apos;s older than you. &quot;Tarnation&quot;, a life story, is a striking view of a unique personality. \n\nJonathan Caouette, its director, is now in his thirties; but it&apos;s like he had planned it all his life, like if he had known it would be a completed project all along. Here we see a lot of films inside of the big film, that Caouette put together to show who he is, what he does, how he feels and how the people who live around him act. \n\nMore than the rest, there is a focus on his mother, Renee LeBlanc, who suffers from schizophrenia and didn&apos;t live with him for a long time. She lives with him now and Jonathan lived with his grandparents for a lot of years, and he didn&apos;t know his father but he tried to find him; and he also lived with foster parents and he always knew he was gay.\n\nThis and more is seen in the images he put together in a program anyone with a Macintosh Apple- computer can use. I don&apos;t want to say much more because &quot;Tarnation&quot;, although not great, is really magical and inspiringMagical because is like nothing you&apos;ve ever seen before; inspiring because it shows and speaks of the creativity of the filmmaker. It will give to anyone who&apos;s thinking about doing cinema ideas about tons of things, unstoppably.\n\nAnd &quot;Tarnation&quot; is also a film for any true cinema lover, because it contains references to a lot of names and important influential cinematographic figures. But influential for him, who, as he inspires us, shows us who inspired himOne example that comes to mind is the fact that Caouette and a friend made a musical stage version of David Lynch&apos;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; when they were in high school. \n\nHe says it in the film&apos;s tag-line: &quot;Your greatest creation is the life you lead&quot;, and he is right. So be encouraged, and if you feel that you should make a film out of every day you live, don&apos;t worry and write about it; or carry a camera with you through the day. This is the kind of message &quot;Tarnation&quot; wants to leave, cinematically. \n\nEmotionally, it wants to show the truly difficult experiences of a genius who, somehow, had a whole movie in his head and wanted the world to know he&apos;s not afraid of showing these experiences with and in itLife is like that, you can&apos;t escape it; write that down.",

The photography is awesome but the unbelievable tenacity in the face of such a hostile environment coupled with a matter-fact commentary in a German accent can only be described as a mental defect or simply German. Try and see it up big and certainly Hi-Def, if you want edge of the seat stuff, then this is the film for you. It captures something I have never seen before in a documentary, it is incredible, it is insane, it is the first film I have ever seen where I needed a drink after!",

Having recently arrived there, Blanche lives quite a lonely life, until she becomes friends with another young woman, Lea (Sophie Renoir), through which she met her boyfriend Fabien (Eric Viellard), and an acquaintance of the couple, Alexandre (François-Eric Gendron). Basically, the movie follows the time honored plot of exchange of relationships. A is with B, and C with D, but then A will start a liaison with D, which will make C jealous, and would start going with B in revenge and so forth. The title in French is a pun: the boyfriend of my friend would (could) become my boyfriend. Rohmer is known to be a political conservative, but here he is hardly a moralist, since he examines the sexual freedom of today&apos;s youth without condemning it. The movie is slow and talky, but these characters are believable and appealing (if somewhat shallow and a bit better looking than ordinary).",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Herbstmilch&quot; (Autumn Milk) is an unsentimental though very touching movie about this woman growing up in the German-countryside-reality before and during the second world war.\n\nThe book, this movie is based on, is the biography of Bavarian peasant woman Anna Wimschneider. As oldest daughter in the family, she has to take over responsibility for her 5 younger siblings and the complete household including two older brothers and her father, after her mother passed away, giving birth to the youngest child. That time Anna is only 8 years old.\n\nTen years later, against the will of both families, she marries Albert Wimschneider shortly before WW2 and becomes peasant women. Instead of the younger brothers and sisters, she now has to care about some nasty old relatives and a mother in law who hates her. During the war she has to do all the field work on top, even while she is pregnant.\n\nThis movie shows in a touching and never sentimental way every day struggle in the 30/40th in the German country. Anna never entirely looses faith and she even keeps and lives her own little romantic corner of her heart.\n\nBeside real Anna Wimschneiders appearance during the end-titles of the movie, her real husband Albert Wimschneider plays the role of one of his own old uncles. The role of Albert Wimschneider is played by talented and very handsome actor Werner Stocker who was forecast to have a great career but sadly died of cancer in 1993. Anna Wimschneider, who also died only a few years after the movie was released, is played by Dana Vávrová. She is married with Joseph Vilsmaier, director of the movie. She had met him the first time, when he was cinematographer for the German TV-mini series &quot;Ein Stück Himmel&quot; where she played the leading role, when she was 15.\n\n&quot;Herbstmilch&quot; gets released on DVD in July (2004).",

The best part of this movie is that it doesn&apos;t go for cheap scares, such as something jumping out or ominous music at key points in the film. If you can handle a little bit of gore, you should be fine. The ending won&apos;t blow you away, but you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed either. This is a solid film that isn&apos;t too scary, but it&apos;s no Muppet movie. Colin Hanks is solid as usual. The killer didn&apos;t quite meet my expectations on the creepy scale, but he is serviceable.",

      "reviewBody": "The film is a breath of fresh air from the typical HK &quot;crime drama&quot; genre otherwise encumbered by formulaic plots, predictable character persona, and inane moral proselytizing. Sadly, it fails to live up to it&apos;s own aspirations and ends up defaulting on precisely what it needs to distance itself from.\n\nThe story revolves around three members of a police surveillance squad conducting an investigation into a financial investment group involved in criminal fraud. The focus of the plot, however, is actually on the three officers themselves who stumble upon an opportunity to capitalize on the information they gathered during their surveillance. The audience is given insights into the personal issues they are grappling with, the relationship between them, and why the temptation to breach their moral duty and professional obligations is so powerful. The temptation they confront and the attendant reasons that compel them to succumb to it become the very device that turns them into the film&apos;s antagonists.\n\nSadly, the script then makes a wrong turn. Instead of allowing this plot to unfold, it is shelved half-way through the film and becomes a side-plot to a criminal conspiracy involving murder, kidnapping, and revenge, rendering the film from an interesting exploration into a run-of-the-mill crime-drama action flick. None of the actors seemed particularly interested in their roles after that, with perhaps the exception of Michael Wong, who plays the head of the investment group with his usual steel-cold glare and villainous flair. He actually makes an entertaining performance in the latter half of the film when he receives more screen time because no one else seemed nearly as excited to be involved in this project anymore.\n\nI don&apos;t know why the film&apos;s name was translated to English as &quot;Overheard&quot; since the electronic surveillance devices they used were also visual and not just audio. Perhaps something got &quot;lost in translation&quot;, like the intention to produce a complex and interesting film."

But it&apos;s definitely an atomspheric one, and atmosphere goes a long way.\n\nAgain, this is not a good movie, per se. The acting is obvious throughout, The story is interesting, though, in a The Shining meets Fright Night meets The Red Shoe Diaries way. The filming borders on surreal so what it lacks in skill and technicality it more than makes up for in mood, with some interesting camera work set in and around a dusky, gothic, punk rock Miami. And while Christina Fulton&apos;s acting isn&apos;t a revelation, her performance in the film is quirky, sensual and haunting.\n\nFor the horror heads, there&apos;s plenty of gore, sex and dark humor to keep the interest up while the twilit, dark and dreamlike quality of the film makes it a worthy watch. Especially if time and your favorite vice(s) are handy. So, yeah, it&apos;s not a good movie, but with an open mind, it&apos;s a fun and memorable one.",

      "reviewBody": "All in all, I would say that &quot;Perl oder Pica&quot; is a decent movie. The settings and the costumes are the best things in it, they recapture the image of the European 1960s, which were still quite gloomy and post-war influenced but which had some elements of modernity slowly creeping in. The story is OK as well, although I was expecting something more dramatic. I was waiting for a life-altering event to take place in Norbi&apos;s life but there is not much happening there, it is just a selection of episodes picturing boyhood experiences. The movie could also be defined as a series of vignettes-like illustrations of an European country that still had trouble coping with the memories of WWII and entering in the age of modernity, seen through the eyes of a pre-adolescent boy. The acting was alright, there were some exaggerations here and there but they might have been intentional. Finally, I would say that it is a good movie which could have been better if it had tackled more critical issues and concentrated more on the context rather than the boy&apos;s life, which in the end was just as any other kid&apos;s life in the &apos;60s and to some extent even nowadays (I am thinking of authoritative parents and teachers, school bullying, learning the &apos;facts of life&apos;...). I have to mention though, that the movie is set in my hometown of Esch/Alzette and it was quite thrilling to see sights I know very well projected on the silver screen!",

Cagney is as ruthless as in White Heat, but here, his pathology is under control, (brain surgery after his Oil Tank &quot;accident&quot; in Part 1?) so he can blackmail cops and smoothly double-cross his erstwhile moll while skimming wherever else and whenever he can. In the first couple of minutes of the film, he shoots a fellow prison escapee &quot;just because&quot;. His sense of loyalty to his supposed accomplices goes downhill from there.\n\nBarbara Payton is a more resonant and convincing actress than Virginia Mayo, and it can be argued that her strength as an actress creates much of the tension here: We want to see her get wise to the Cagney character&apos;s dirty game, and also succeed in avenging her brother&apos;s death (the fellow escapee shot in the beginning of the film). And unlike the case of Virginia Mayo&apos;s unsympathetic moll in White Heat, we actually do root for her to gain a comeuppance against the Cagney character. But we&apos;re torn. Cagney has so much natural charisma, even when playing a snake, that we can never entirely want him to get his. There is a sense of justice and inevitability to the ending. But there remains the nagging hurt feeling at what Cagney-- with all that bristling energy and industry and charisma-- COULD have accomplished if he hadn&apos;t succumbed to the dark side. Ten stars. See it!"

Steve and Teri Irwin are fantastic.  They are funny, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and truly care about ecology and conservation.  But they&apos;re not actors; and they know this.  My advice to the reluctant renter is this: get the DVD, watch the movie and try not to pay too much attention to the CIA plot. The real fun is watching Steve and Teri &quot;muck it up&quot; with all sorts of deadly creatures.  And what makes this even better is that all of the animals are real and it&apos;s all Steve and Teri doing the stunts.  After the movie, make sure to watch all of the behind the scenes extras.  Like how Steve and his long time zoo colleague Wes organized and rehearsed the King Brown snake scene.  And how they trained the crocs to attack Steve on cue.  There&apos;s one take that actually made me jump in my chair, just knowing the real danger that Steve and Wes had to face to get a short scene in.  I won&apos;t say which one, you&apos;ll have to watch them all."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Tokyo!&quot; is a three-way with Michel Gondry, Leos Carax, and Joon-ho Bong, re-inventing Japans great city as modern fairy tales. Three fantasies of alienation, form into the most unique, original, and entertaining film of the year so far. \n\nGondry is up first with an adaption from a comic book by Gabrielle Bell &quot;Cecil &amp; Jordan in NewYork&quot;(surprised was I, cus its one of my favorite stories by her, I did a presentation on it and everything) here retitled as &quot;Interior Design&quot;. The two collaborated on the screen play, and it shows in a return to form, from his last good natured but slightly flat, &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot;. The story is of a couple who move to Tokyo, to screen an experimental film. The director is the boyfriend, and his girlfriend is his editor, transport, and support, though he claims she lacks ambition. They are looking for an apartment, and staying with a friend in a one room apartment. The boyfriend finds a job, the girlfriend looks for an apartment, job, and place to fit in becoming more marginalized all the time, until she begins to transform into...someone useful. Shades of &quot;The Bedsitting Room&quot; can be found here, but Gondry&apos;s trademark visual style is in full effect, featuring some amazing special effects, and fun set designs. It asks, Is it more important to be defined by what one loves, or what one does? \n\nCaravax&apos;s segment, called &quot;Merde&quot; is about a creature, like an overgrown Leprechaun, who crawls up from the sewer and begins accosting random people on the streets, eating flowers and money, licking and shoving anything and anyone who crosses his path, all to the theme of the original Godzilla. Needless to say he becomes an overnight celebrity(in Japan Sada Abe became a celebrity after murdering and removing the genitals of her lover, she played herself in plays about her life after she got out of prison, and this was before WW1. Nowadays the people photograph their monsters with camera phones). The creatures rampages turn violent, in one thrilling and especially horrific scene, and he is arrested and put on trial. The reason this is the weakest of the three, is because the creature speaks a gibberish language, and during an interrogation scene, we have about five minutes of gibberish talk, not translated til the following scene, its not really funny or dramatic, just kinda tiresome and awkward like a Monty Python skit dragged out too long. Its easy to point to terrorism and racism as the grand theme here, &quot;he&apos;s linked to Al Queda and the Aum Cult&quot;, etc, but misanthropy in general works just as well, and is in keeping with the alienation that courses through all of the stories. Denis Lavent&apos;s performance is the best in the film, he manages to make the most inhuman character real, somewhere between Gollum and a homeless paranoid schizophrenic. \n\nIt&apos;s similar to an early Gondry short film actually, where Michel takes a s*%t in a public restroom and David Cross in a turd suit follows him around claiming to be his son and shouting racial slurs at passerby&apos;s, til he eventually outgrows his s%&amp;t cocoon and emerges from it in full Nazi uniform to Gondry&apos;s dismay. \n\nOn the note of rampaging monsters, the final film is from Joon-ho bong, director of &quot;The Host&quot;, called &quot;Shaking Tokyo&quot; about a hermit or hikikomori as they are a called in the land of the rising sun. A man has not left his house in ten years, having only human contact in weekly visits from a pizza man, whom he never looks in the face, has his delicate life jostled when an earthquake renders an attractive pizza-girl unconscious, and he is forced into direct contact. Eventually he resolves to leave his house to find her again, only to discover, or for us to discover the world is not as we remember it. Its an painfully funny but true idea (like Mike Judge&apos;s Idiocracy), that in the future, the final frontier of a technological society will become actual face to face interactions between human beings. Any of these stories would feel at home in an issue of Mome or a Haruki Marukami book of short stories, they are vibrant, whimsical, modern fantasy, that are almost so universal in their simplicity they could be told anywhere. The movie could take place in any city really, with some tweaking, but the stories do resonate specially with Tokyo. Its the best thing I&apos;ve seen in a theater this year, I was smiling continuously throughout. Its 2 hours, but it goes by like lightning. Some of the stories may seem slight at first, so entertaining, it cant but be meaningless. But this ain&apos;t the case, each director brings something unique to the table, like another under-seen triptych of recent, the Atlanta made horror film &quot;The Signal&quot;, &quot;Tokyo!&apos;s&quot; directors feel like a band, jamming together more than separate artists trying to upstage each other, like in something like &quot;Paris Je&apos;Taime&quot;. Funny, charming, dynamic, strange, sincere, absurd, movie making. A place of robots, amphibious mutants, monstrous trolls, magical transformations, and to quote Merde &quot;eyes which look like a woman&apos;s sex&quot;. Two Frenchmen and a Korean, re-invent Japan the city which upgrades itself more than any other, and we are all the better for it. What a strange bright future we live in.",

NOT a romantic comedy so why anyone would complain that it didn&apos;t tick the boxes of some pointless romcon i don&apos;t know. It never said it WAS a romantic comedy!!!

Right from the first scene, though, I knew I had found a hidden gem. According to Wikipedia, the movie premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released on a very small scale in December 2008 due to the collapse of its distributor, Yari Film Group. It is a straight- forward crime drama, showcasing the struggle of gangsters who want to change their lives. It is set apart, however, by the fact that it is based on Goodman&apos;s real life until the mid-1990s. Some guys deal with their demons with telling their story in a meetingGoodman made a bad-ass movie about hisand Ruffalo, Hawke, and the rest of the cast (including Goodman) played the hell out of their roles.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never cried because of a movie.  I always sympathize with characters, yet I never empathize.  I can never feel the true emotion.  Sure, &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; had amazing worksmanship, but it didn&apos;t do anything for me, and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; is equally as good, but neither, as well as pretty much any other film I&apos;ve seen, has made me cry.\n\n But &quot;Failan&quot; made me come pretty close.\n\nAt first, I was skeptical of the film.  Korean films have come a long way, yet I trust their action and flashy stylish movies more then their dramas. &quot;JSA&quot; and &quot;Shiri&quot; are great, &quot;Jakarta&apos;s&quot; a lot of fun, and &quot;Nowhere to Hide&quot; is stylistical live manga if I&apos;ve ever seen it.\n\nBut &quot;Failan&quot; comes out of nowhere, and makes me wonder why this didn&apos;t make it out of Korea.  It&apos;s hands down one of the best films of the last year. Storywise, it avoids cliche, and other traps of romantic/tragic films, and comes out on its own.\n\nThe story is simple.  A wretched bum Kang Jae(Min-Sik Choi of Shiri fame) who sells pornography and is involved in the organized crime syndicate in Inchon marries Failan (Cecilia Cheung in an amazing performance,) a young Chinese girl abandoned and alone in the world in a marriage of convenience; she gets to stay in Korea and work, and he gets some cash for it.  The two never meet, yet Failan is eternally grateful.\n\nThe thing is though, Failan is not even mentioned until 45 minutes into the story.  Until that point, you&apos;re following the life of Kang Jae.  But as you soon discover, both are tragic characters.  Failan, is one of the most beautiful characters put onto film; not just in terms of outer aesthetics, but in terms of inner beauty.  She is the sweetest character I&apos;ve seen in a film, and that fact makes it even harder to watch.\n\nThe film borders on drama and melodrama, but thankfully, most of it is not melodramatic.  Oh sure, there&apos;s some parts where the audience scoffs, but there are other parts when what is happening is so tragically beautiful, that you can&apos;t help but get involved emotionally.  Thankfully, most of it is subtle and not slam in your face &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; style.  What affected me was when Kang Jae was reading the letter from Failan thanking him for being the kindest person she&apos;s met.  What&apos;s said isn&apos;t long prose, and if you&apos;re familiar with the Korean language, the sentence structure is very simple. However, the way in which the Failan&apos;s voice-over reads it is so innocent, so sweet, and so full of emotion that I choked up at that point.\n\n The rest of the film is equally as wonderful.  The group I saw it with, 2 girls and 3 guys all in college, were all equally affected.  It surprises me that Shiri, conceivably a Hollywood-esque film (albeit very well done) gets a release in the U.S but this one doesn&apos;t.\n\nIf you get a chance to see this film, do not hesitate.  It took me a while to get into it, as the first 45 minutes seem to have little bearing on the story, but they actually do.  Beautiful acting, cinematography, and a story. Highly Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in July 1991 after watching the movie on RCA/Columbia video cassette.\n\nMichael Winner&apos;s attempt at a rollicking caper comedy falls flat in &quot;Bullseye!&quot;. Film opened in London last November but is just a direct-to-video title with big name stars for domestic consumption.\n\nInspiration was evidently the smash &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, whose star and creator John Cleese makes a cameo here. Unfortunately that film was probably a fluke since the caper format seems tired indeed this time. It&apos; a pity, since Winner made one of the best &apos;60s pics in the genre, &quot;The Jokers&quot;.\n\nHere, Michael Caine and Roger Moore front for a preposterous story line. Both are criminals, whose exact look-alikes happen to be government scientists who&apos;ve devised a nuclear fusion energy process that promises cheap electrical power.\n\nWith their old partner Sally Kirkland as instigator they set about to steal the corrupt scientists&apos; cache of diamonds (taken as bribes from foreign powers) from a safety deposit box.. This feat accomplished, the second half of the film chases around Scotland as the criminals are supposedly working for UK and USA government agencies to get the scientists&apos; formula and thwart the baddies&apos; attempt to sell it to the enemy.\n\nWinner delivers his usual sprightly pace, but the frequent sight gags and dumb jokes aren&apos;t funny. Both Caine and Moore strain for laughs, the former made up like W. C. Fields with a false nose and latter bugging his eyes out in frequent astonishment. Moore&apos;s real-life daughter, pouty Deborah Barrymore, is cast as an unlikely 22-year-old CIA agent.\n\nKirkland, who wears gaudy outfits for no reason in the later reels like she did in &quot;Cold Feet&quot;, is okay in a strictly functional role. In addition to Cleese, Jenny Seagrove and Patsy Kensit make pointless cameos.\n\nShot in 1989, pic has dated rapidly, especially a final gag involving a lookalike of then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher. John Du Prez, who scored &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, punches up the film with catchy music, but his jaunty main theme is way too close to John Dankworth&apos;s classic &quot;Morgan!&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "This marvellous film neatly sets up a position - that the Swiss Tyrol is the traditional pleasant place of thigh slapping, jolly peasants and picturesque vies. From these images, composer will create his masterpiece. But to get the right mood, the staff at the swank hotel he is staying at must get themselves up in traditional costume - the image is artifice. Into this artificial, romantic world comes the dialectical opposition: Laurel &amp; Hardy, with their arguments and bad luck. Immediately they arrive, the locals are shown to be devious cheats. They are then forced to work as slaves in the hotel to pay off an enormous food bill. All the while the composer is writing his ridiculous score, full of innocent mountain maids and singing crickets. The composer&apos;s prima-donna wife arrives and his false vision of innocence is shattered. She wants to play the innocent Swiss miss in his new work but he, rightly, rejects her as too worldly. To get the role, she connives, flirts and manipulates the hotel staff, including L &amp; H. The greatest sequence involves our heroes attempting to get a piano across an Alpine valley rope bridge - the precarious position of artificial human culture within a dangerous natural world is exposed. To add icing to this cake, they are finally attacked on the rope bridge by a gorilla! This gorilla in the Swiss Alps might be something which Luis Bunuel would have enjoyed. In the end, the composer welcomes his wife back and accepts the artificial, anything-but-innocent nature of his art. L &amp; H, the latter of whom has been in love with the wife, are chased away from the village by, of course, the gorilla.",

      "name": "A serial killer hunts down released ex-cons convicted of pedophilia in a setting where corridors represent the mind and the city is a corridor!",
      "reviewBody": "The film&apos;s story-line in a nutshell is: A serial killer hunts down released convicts who did time for pedophilia related charges. Two police officers Akrep Celal and Commissioner Abbas are out to get Istanbul&apos;s first serial killer, whom all the visible traces suggest to be Ensar, a young man who just returned from his army service and has lost a sibling to pedophilia! \n\nFirst of all lest just mention the ONLY positive thing about his film: the CAST! Director and actor Ugur Yucel manages to use his persona and connections very well to bring together gorgeous Kenan Imirzalioglu and psychotic looking, mad-acting Nejat Isler in the same movie! This is the equivalent of having Brad Pitt and Christian Bale in the same picture with Robert De Niro as the director and mentor. Good, no? Well not really! Not when the rest of the cast is composed of FLESH and not actors. Berrak Tuzunatac, a beautiful face placed on a big and curvy body and Ceyda Duvenci, looks that loose meaning after staring for 5 seconds, as well as all other co-actors make this what-could-have-been a well ensemble cast look like they were put together not to make a good movie but to make few bucks of the talent and name of some and the body and sexuality of others! I am afraid this is the case with Dragon Cage! \n\nNow to the constructive criticism as to the very nisch-nischs of this movie. If Ugur Yucel is to look back to the failure of this movie in a few weeks (and fail this movie will at the box office) and ask why, he should be told: It&apos;s the script you stupid! Ugur Yucel might be one of the best actors of Turkish cinema and definitely a GREAT director based on his first two movies. Looking at these facts one would assume he would know what a bad script is when he reads it. Seems not! The script for Ejder Kapani is not only a bad montage made from similar famous movies (seven, crimson rivers...) but it lacks any local taste it could have inserted and gave a taste of originality with! The storyline is obvious and it gives itself away from minute 10 and the dialogs, oh the dialogs! Could they have been more obvious?! \n\nAs a good director, based on his previous two films, Mr Yucel does a less than OK job directing here. The films editing and pace never match, mood building scenes of walking and chasing are the SAME all across the film, the city is meant to be turned into a labyrinth through camera angles and dark choice of film footage however it lacks the, again, locality of Istanbul and all the &apos;fear&apos; and &apos;expectations&apos; are pushed on the audience by simply making the screen darker and the music heavier! And the music! Oh lord when will my people learn to not do what Hollywood stopped doing 30 years ago? Mood pushing music? Really! The worst part of Mr Yucel&apos;s directing though is closely associated with the film&apos;s greatest strenght: the cast! Main characters over act too much! Which brilliant mind thought that casting Kenan Imirzalioglu as an angry police officer and Nejat Isler as a psychotic looking type is a good idea, hasn&apos;t both been done many a times before?! Why do they allow to be type-casted is another question and worry I have!\n\nThe movie fell very short of what I was expecting and it was the one movie I have been looking forward to the most in Turkey this year! Avoid it!",

Wender&apos;s beautiful slow moving style to unfold the story lets you follow and feel what&apos;s going on within the &quot;hero&quot; and the people he encounters. The marvelous scenery of the West is shot to remind you of some scenes of &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;. The music blends in wonderfully. The interactions are almost every time worked out in every detail and dialogs sound so real you can imagine this to happen in your neighborhood. Last not least all of it is played by an outstanding group of actors making it very hard to decide who&apos;d be your favorite which adds to complete the reason why this movie is excellent to me.\n\nFunny scenes, laughter and deep emotions - if you&apos;re a lover of fast-food (movies) - don&apos;t go.

      "reviewBody": "Bloody hell!!! I tell you, I&apos;m used to seeing rough and cruel horror films but I assure you this one is really hard to watch at times! You can either take that as a recommendation or as a warning! Mark of the Devil portrays the rites of witchfinding near Austria/ Germany in the 17th century. Honorable men who&apos;re satisfying their own bloody and perverted lusts by killing young women in the name of God Himself. This film shows a lot of resemblance to the British classic starring Vincent Price  The Witchfinder General  only it&apos;s a lot more explicit and rawin other words: a lot more `exploitation&apos;-like! Mark of the Devil contains multiple sequences in which girls are severely tortured, mutilated and eventually killed! It may be disgusting at times, but it&apos;s a very realistic portrayal of the absurdity and horror that actually took place once. The arrogance and naiveté of the Catholic Church is terrifically presented through the performances of Herbert Lom (Lord Cumberland) and Reggie Nalder (Albino) who still their appetite for terror by abusing God&apos;s name. Potential viewers who&apos;re interested in medieval torture-techniques will have the time of their lives while watching this film!  The whip plays a leading role in this film, along with other bizarre methods such as burnings, the ripping of tongues and fingernails, stretching people and a truly horrific ritual that involves freezing cold drops of water.  \n\nThe scenery and used locations are magnificent and the guiding music is absolutely brilliant. Mark of the Devil really belongs to the greatest films ever made in the category of European nasty&apos; exploitation. The film can even count on a solid cast including a very young Udo Kier! Here, he is at the very beginning of a rich career that is still growing to be more impressive. It&apos;s a thrill to see a film featuring this living Cult-cinema legend at young and promising age. Udo Kier plays Herbert Lom&apos;s pupil, a very devoted witchfinder-to-be. devoted that is, until he falls head over heals in love with a beauty who&apos;s accused of witchery! Mark of the Devil also stars a couple of ravishing girls (you&apos;ll learn that presumed witches are a damn good-looking species) that definitely live up to the Hammer beauties around that same time. Whatever you dodon&apos;t let the bad reviews scare you off! Mark of the Devil isn&apos;t nearly as bad as they sayJust because some people can&apos;t handle a share amount of graphic violence doesn&apos;t mean the film is awful.",

Victory Jory makes for a suitably gaunt and sinister villain, but the rest of the cast are undistinguished here and the special FX are typically limited to some grey face makeup that reminded me of the cemetery zombie in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.",

      "name": "Once again , Bronson/Kersey blows away baddies  with lots of explicit ,gory and grisly violence",
      "reviewBody": "Extremely violent follow-up to the successful 1974 movie based on the characters written by Brian Garfield , whose novel the picture is based on . Last entry in the original five film series in which Kersey takes the law on his own hands , searching for vengeance against mobsters when his girlfriend is victimized again . The five-times-weary urban vigilant hits gangsters , this time , hard . Death Wish : The face of death¨(1994) that would be the last and it was then not made for about another seven years , being starred by with Leslie Anne Down , Michael Parks , Chuck Shamata , Saul Rubinek and Miguel Sandoval . Sequel to successful crime thriller that created the Vigilante genre with Bronson as the main star as architect Paul Kersey (wooding acting by Bronson who looks bored and tired with this rehash material) turned the one-man vigilante when his sweetheart , a clothing manufacturer (Leslie Anne Down) , has her business threatened , being attacked by mobsters , one of whom turns out to be her sadistic ex (Michael Parks) and a hired killer (Robert Joy) hitting her on a mirror . \n\nThis fifth entry with excessive violence concerns about Paul Kersey , an ageing architect who becomes again into vigilante and wiping out the band of mobsters . The main amusement results to be to guess the kinds of deaths that Bronson executes against the villains , as he carries out retribution and vendetta . This 5º outing from the novel ¨Death wish¨ by Brian Garfield in which an architect taking the law into his own revengeful hands and acting as judge , jury and executioner . It contains suspense, noisy action-packed , intrigue , thrills and lots of violence . Initial excitement at the welter of violence son palls into boredom , only intermittently relieved by the preposterousness . Mediocre screenplay manages a couple of nice twists , but it&apos;s too formulary to pursue the ambiguities it reveals . Here filmmaker emphasising a hostile , nightmare terrain and relying his virtually sympathies with the confused , violent Paul Kersey . Bronson with his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties . Screenwriter re-wrote the entire script while filming but Charles Bronson constantly had problems with the dialog . It&apos;s certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Kersey-Bronson&apos;s side . Furthermore , it benefits from some good support actors , as here appears a nice secondary cast , such as : Chuck Shamata , Michael Parks , Saul Rubinek , Miguel Sandoval , Kenneth Welsh , among others . It packs a screeching musical score composed, orchestrated and performed by Terry Plumeri . The studio, Cannon : Yoram Globus, Menahem and Damián Lee produced this one in enough budget . The motion picture was poorly directed by Allan Goldstein (2001 a space travesty , When Justice Fails , Home team , Jungle boy , Chain dance , Private lessons) . \n\nThe original film ¨Death wish¨ had great commercial hit , it was followed by various extremely violent sequels to this successful 1974 movie , that&apos;s , of course , the best from the series , being starred by Hope Lange , Stuart Margolin , William Redfield and Jeff Goldblum . This first big hit motion picture was middling directed by Michael Winner such as the successive films with his main star, Charles Bronson , usually giving wooden performance . In the mid-70 Winner , in need to other hit smashes attempted with the sequels , but both , Bronson and Winner , looked increasingly passionless and mechanical in the later years of their partnership in this cheap as well as worn-out final series . The worst sequels in which Kersey goes on to torture robbers , all of them inferior and the violence could be deemed exaggerated , they are the followings : ¨Death wish II¨ by Michael Winner with Jill Ireland , Anthony Franciosa , JD Cannon and Vincent Gardenia , ¨Death Wish III¨ by Winner with Ed Lauter , Martin Balsam , Gavan O&apos;Herlihy and Deborah Raffin . However , Michael Winner showed no interest in directing Death Wish 4 because he had heard that Charles Bronson had a terrible experience filming Death Wish III (1985). Following ¨Death Wish 4 : The crackdown¨(1987) with Kay Lenz , John P Ryan , Perry López , Soon-Teck-Oh directed by J.Lee Thompson . In addition , an intended but unfilmed sixth movie was also to have a subtitle: &apos;Death Wish 6: The New Vigilante&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Love animation, it was a big part of my life as a child, particularly Disney, Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry, and still love it whether it&apos;s film, television or cartoons.\n\nAlso have much admiration for Tex Avery, an animation genius whose best cartoons are animated masterpieces and some of the best ever made by anybody. &apos;Red Hot Rangers&apos;, like Avery&apos;s other George and Junior series, doesn&apos;t represent him at his best, this was prime-era Tex Avery (1940s at the MGM) and most other cartoons from this period were far more representative of that which does make the cartoon a slight disappointment. While it is a long way from being one of his funniest or most inventive, &apos;Red Hot Rangers&apos; is not a bad cartoon at all, and other than a slight lack of variety (inevitable when the humour revolves mostly around a running gag), particularly with the behaviour of the flame, there is very little wrong with it.\n\nAlthough it is not hilarious, &apos;Red Hot Rangers&apos; does have very amusing moments and is timed well, and while Avery&apos;s wild and wacky approach that is so distinctive comes through stronger elsewhere this is hardly devoid of either.\n\nGeorge and Junior are an appealing and amusing double act. The flame is a decent foil, though its behaviour is on the repetitious side. Avery is also on voice acting duty and he shows as much talent for that as he had for directing and animating, both of which he also does a characteristically very good job. Dick Nelson joins him with the voice acting and he&apos;s fine.\n\nIt is no surprise that the animation is superb, being rich in colour and detail. The character designs are unique, Avery always did have creative character designs, and suitably fluid. The music, courtesy of Scott Bradley, is lushly and cleverly orchestrated, with lively and energetic rhythms and fits very well indeed.\n\nOverall, nowhere near classic Avery but worth tracking down. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Boxcar Bertha is an early Scorcese, made just on the eve of his highly personal breakthrough film Mean Streets. In other words, these were the days before he could call the shots and was merely a jobbing director. It&apos;s a cheap exploitation flick, and like most B-pictures it&apos;s a cash-in knock-off of a recent hit movie  in this case Bonnie and Clyde. It crams in all the essential ingredients for the genre  hold-ups, union men, pinkertons, chain gangs and, of course, boxcars  along with a dash of nudity and gory violence to help it sell.\n\nThe story follows the same arc as its peers  likable proles take to a life of crime to escape the depression, have a number of run-ins and adventures, until they eventually meet their downfall. The screenplay is fairly lazy and predictable, although the writers have tried to inject some depth and conflict to the characters. Bill, for example, struggles to reconcile his socialist values with his individualist criminal antics. Rake is ashamed of his cushy city roots and wants desperately to prove himself. Bertha herself is portrayed as a kind of happy-go-lucky individual with no real agenda apart from living the life she enjoys and being with the man she loves. Sadly these ideas are never fully explored, and tend to get lost behind the simplistic b-action setting.\n\nBoxcar Bertha also happens to be surprisingly loaded with religious references, painting Bill as a Jesus-like figure. Most obvious of these is the highly symbolic ending, but there are a number of more subtle hints. A scene somewhere in the middle opens with David Carradine standing before a biblical fresco, and later in the city Barbara Hershey stops to look at a film poster for The Man who Could Work Miracles. The religious angle is something which actually runs through all of Scorcese&apos;s work, rarely stated out loud but always under the surface.\n\nScorcese&apos;s technical style is fairly functional and not too flamboyant, but there are some hints towards the methods he would later make his own. He relies very heavily upon the editing process for impact  a dynamic cut emphasises every moment of action. There aren&apos;t too many of the lengthy tracking shots that he is known for, and what camera moves there are are shaky and poorly planned, even if he really is trying to make something of them. This is all understandable though  planning elaborate camera moves is very time consuming, and apparently the shoot for this picture was a mere twenty-four days. Besides, snappy editing is a good way to get something out of next to nothing in a fast-paced action flick.\n\nIt&apos;s an interesting touch to see father and son actors John and David Carradine playing each others nemeses. Both are fine actors, although unfortunately the former was largely relegated to minor supporting parts in A pictures, while the latter was usually lumbered with lead roles in B pictures. Only occasionally did either of them get to shine, and Carradine Senior is particularly good here even if it is another small role. But the real standout here is Barbara Hershey in the title role. She gives Bertha a kind of playful innocence, but allows the character to mature and show more depth of emotion towards the end of the picture.\n\nWhen all&apos;s said and done, Boxcar Bertha is a cut above the average cheapie, but only a small cut. Scorcese has done a fair job with the material, and there is an occasional surprising moment of quality. It&apos;s good fun too in many places, particularly the cheeky dialogue given to Bernie Casey (Von), as well as the Laurel and Hardy-like pinkerton agents. But it also has a dull plot, annoying musical score, cheep-and-cheerful production values and is just too short to really take off.",

      "reviewBody": "In Mexico City, the powerful and violent magnate of steel Oscar Cabos (Pedro Armendáriz Jr.) surprises his daughter Paulina (Ana Claudia Talancón) having sex with her boyfriend and his employee Javier &quot;Jaque&quot; (Tony Dalton) and he works Jaque over. On the next day, Jaque pays a visit to Cabos in his office and the angry man comes with a golf club to hit Jaque again. However, Cabo accidentally treads on a golf ball, falls on the floor and faints. Jaque calls his best friend Mudo (Kristoff) to help him, but the janitor Nacho (Pedro Altamirano) finds his boss fainted on the floor and he steals and dresses his clothes and jewels. Meanwhile, Nacho&apos;s son Botcha (Raúl Méndez) and his friend Nico (Gustavo Sánchez Parra) have planned to kidnap Cabos and they are waiting for him in the garage. When he arrives in the place, the two kidnappers hit him on the back, believing that he is Cabos, and they wear a hood covering his face. They head with the abducted man to the house of Botcha&apos;s girlfriend Lula (Rocío Verdejo). Meanwhile, Jaque and Mudo calls their wrestler friend Ruben &quot;Mascarita&quot; (Joaquín Cosio) and his midget partner Tony &apos;El Cannibal&apos; (Silverio Palacios) to help them to get rid of Cabos in his birthday party. But both plans do not work well along the night.\n\n&quot;Matando Cabos&quot; is a gem of dark humor and one of the funniest comedies that I have recently seen. This comedy of errors has a wonderful and original screenplay, and the situations are unpredictable and hilarious. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Matando Cabos&quot; (&quot;Killing Cabos&quot;)",

      "name": "&apos;Change of Plans&apos; is helped by sharp wit and realistic characters",
      "reviewBody": "In this French comedy directed by Danièle Thompson and written by Danièle Thompson and Christopher Thompson, the story centers around a summer dinner party where ten acquaintances come together for food, wine, and friendship, while trying to cover up their own personal troubles. Consisting of mostly middle aged couples, if they are not having affairs, they are dissatisfied with their life, or going through family issues. With an all-star ensemble cast from France, the characters each have their own story which are intertwined with one another.\n\nI admit I&apos;m generally turned off by &quot;comedies&quot; involving infidelity. There are always some dislikeable characters, the &quot;comedy&quot; isn&apos;t really funny, and rarely have I ever seen a good ending. The poster for Change of Plans displayed multiple characters from the chest down playing footsies under a dinner table, which reminded me of a typical episode from Three&apos;s Company. Add to that, a film that boasts an &quot;ensemble cast&quot; usually suffers from a lack of focus and over-simplified storytelling. To add, this is a French film, whereas a subject like this is as typical as a British outdoor breakfast scene on PBS.\n\nUnexpectedly, though, I enjoyed this film. True, there&apos;s a typicality to the situations in this film, but it was well-executed. I appreciated the snappy dialogue, the character interactions, and the surprisingly poignant moments. Its wit is sharper than many films of this ilk. The characters react realistically. Dialogue drives this film more than the situations. Admittedly, the characters are relatively jaded and cynical, which adds to the humor. I found it interesting that the film isn&apos;t as interested in the affairs of the characters as much as it is about reconciliation. Advertisement\n\nWhile the centerpiece of this film is the dinner party amongst a group of friends and colleagues, a good chunk of the film is shown in flashbacks, revealing back stories of many of the characters, as well as the relationships that develop after the party. We are told these middle-aged characters have children, but we never see them—perhaps it helps the film keep its focus. We are introduced to ML (Karin Viard), a divorce lawyer, who hosts the dinner party. The guests consist of her teacher Manuela (Blanca Li) from her flamenco class, her husband Piotr (Dany Boon), and her younger sister Juliette (Marina Hands), a costume designer who is dating a much older man Erwann (Patrick Chesnais). There&apos;s also the kitchen designer Jean-Louis (Laurent Stocker) who designed ML&apos;s new kitchen, oncologist Alain (Patrick Bruel) and his gynecologist wife, Melanie (Marina Fois), who secretly wants to end their marriage and run off with her lover. Attorney Lucas (Christopher Thompson) arrives to the party with his wife Sarah (Emmanuelle Seigner), who is Piotr&apos;s old college flame. An unexpected guest is ML&apos;s father, Henri (Pierre Arditi), who has had a strained relationship with Juliette ever since he had run off from the family.\n\nThompson manages to keep the stories working together logically. When characters change, it&apos;s realistic. The film moves at a leisure pace, but is always interesting thanks to the film&apos;s characters, dialogue, and occasional poignant surprises. Admittedly, those who already have problems with talky French films with subtitles will not have their minds changed here. I enjoyed the zigzag table conversations and different topics that go off tangent. I liked how the film didn&apos;t try to be too comedic. There are some great emotional scenes, such as the ones between Henri and Juliette. The actors and actresses all bring fine performances. It&apos;s true that these are not stories I normally gravitate towards, but the film&apos;s little surprises, wit, and characters made the experience more than palatable.\n\nYou can find more of my movie review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art",

In Real Fiction (2000), the protagonist disappears into a day dream in which he has revenge on all those who wronged him in the past; in Spring Summer Autumn Winter... And Spring (2003), a Buddhist monk lives, literally, on an island separated from the rest of the world; any contact with the outside world results in tragedy, be it a visiting mother fleeing with her child (she drowns, though the child, gratefully, survives), or the monk&apos;s apprentice running off with a girl (he ends up murdering her and is wanted by the police); in Bad Guy, the eponymous protagonist tries to find solace through his own love fantasy; and then there is 3 Iron, Kim Ki-Duk&apos;s magnum opus and one of the most remarkable films ever made.\n\n3 Iron seems to tie all the visual and thematic aspects of Kim&apos;s films together, neatly and impressively, making it the &quot;ultimate&quot; Kim Ki-Duk film, much the same way Fitzcarraldo is the &quot;ultimate&quot; Herzog- or North By Northwest was the &quot;ultimate&quot; Hitchcock film. Like every Kim Ki-Duk film, the protagonist is a rank outsider from mainstream society. Like Bad Guy, the character plays his part almost entirely mute (and on this note, both Jo Jae-hyeon&apos;s and Lee Hyun-kyoon&apos;s performances have to be utterly applauded for being both wonderfully subtle and yet so forcefully expressive). Once again, we are faced with a latent dual reality, where the protagonist escapes the world around him, but is also brutally dragged back into it. Like Bad Guy, 3 Iron is a strange love story, albeit a far more assuasive one, where both the characters decide to disappear into &quot;their own world&quot;.\n\nHowever, 3 Iron defies explanation. Can you imagine trying to pitch this to a Hollywood producer? &quot;Ok, there&apos;s this guy and he, like, breaks into people&apos;s houses. He washes their clothes, dishes, bathrooms -.. he even wears their clothes, sleeps in their beds, and repairs stuff for them, like clocks or broken toy guns (with hilarious consequences in the latter&apos;s case!). One day he breaks into a house, thinking he&apos;s alone, but meets an abused wife. When her husband returns, he proceeds to attack the old philanderer in a very original way (which neatly ties in with the title of the film... you&apos;ll see) and she runs off with him. They then enter &quot;his&quot; world and live &quot;his&quot; life together, breaking into houses, etc, before they get dragged back into the real world with all the pain and suffering it brings&quot;. Yeah! That&apos;ll really get the 18-25 demographic rolling down the aisles! Chances are I would have been kicked out midway through the second sentence, though if I&apos;m really honest I wouldn&apos;t actually mind trying to pitch this to Don Simpson, just to see the reaction on his face.\n\nBut it really would be doing this movie little justice to try and &quot;summarise&quot; it in some neat little way. It needs to be watched, it needs to be experienced, like all the great movies. There is no real &quot;idea&quot; in this film, necessarily, nor is there a big &quot;statement&quot; of sorts - Kim Ki-Duk is not a &quot;statement&quot; film-maker like Godard or Eisenstein. Rather, like Lynch, he prefers to make films that work on an instinctive level, in that they draw a gut emotional reaction from you that cannot necessarily be articulated or expressed in an intellectual manner. Is it any coincidence, then, that Kim, like Lynch, primarily hails from a painting background, and actually wanted to be a painter before he became a film-maker?\n\nPaintings are an apt analogy, since every frame is clearly carefully and thoughtfully choreographed (characters are either separated (in both the physical and emotional sense) by vertical-, or they are united by horizontal lines). But putting aside any visual- and textual comparisons to Lynch, Kim Ki-Duk also draws a lot from Wong Kar Wai in terms of narrative, and anyone who has seen Chungking Express should notice comparisons to 3 Iron in that both concentrate on a character who breaks into someone else&apos;s house/flat and lives their life without them noticing, or how one song is ceaselessly repeated to emphasise both the love between the two central characters and, furthermore, the characters&apos; wish to escape reality (though 3 Iron does so more on a less literal level, as I mentioned before) - in Chungking Express, it was California Dreamin&apos; (a song that will never be the same for me after that film, and I suspect a lot of people feel this way), while in 3 Iron it&apos;s &quot;Gafsa&quot; by Natasha Atlas.\n\nStill, I suppose I can conceptualise and intellectualise to my heart&apos;s content - somehow I doubt that any of this will spur you to watch this movie. But I think it should. This film deserves to be seen. It&apos;s a tender, thought-provoking, and ultimately (and quite strangely) heart-warming film, as well as, quite possibly. an indication that Kim Ki-Duk is slowly coming of an age as a film-maker, moving on from an entirely pessimistic worldview to one that is more reassuring and serene. Yes, there is suffering and darkness, but there is also hope, and I think, this, ultimately is what 3 Iron is trying to tell us. It is, in short, utterly required viewing, not to mention the work of a true genius. And it&apos;s really not very often I bandy this word about.",

As this movie is fairly well done-the color for example is very good and the acting is good and the story is interesting-I wonder why it is so little known? The main drawback of the movie is that it is way too talky. As well, the outdoor scenes were so obviously not taken in China and the saucer special effects were not great for 1968 but I&apos;ve seen worse even for that time. Sadly the last film for Dan Duryea who died too young.",

Those elements are all there, except for the last one. It&apos;s tough-to-watch, freakish, occasionally mushy, but it is also a worthwhile movie, one that will stay with you for a long time.\n\nDani Menkin&apos;s documentary is about Texas-born Israeli-Mexican Ami Ankilewitz, who was given six years to live at birth because of muscular dystrophy, which went on quickly to ravage his body while a toddler. At 34, weighing 39 pounds, and able to move only one finger (which he uses to create animated films), Ankilewitz embarks on a voyage across the US to face the doctor, who made that early diagnosis.\n\nPart real-time footage, part recreation (not always successful, especially in the final sequence, with the elderly Cuban doctor looking uncomfortable with the recreation of their confrontation), &quot;39 Pounds&quot; somehow manages to go beyond being a documentary with a message. Ankilewitz&apos;s aspiration to &quot;normal love&quot; will resonate with anyone ever involved in a hopeless affair, and the film maintains its integrity by telling the truth.",

An entertaining, with thrills and suspense revenge assassin movie type not so much dialogue but tons of mindless actions. This film is quite underrated as it was a box office flop and showed that perhaps audiences did not like Zoe Saldana as much as studios had thought. A better film than critics give credit for. \n\nZoe Saldana delivers a very solid performances and some of the action scenes are quite clever and intriguing. Some things which could have been done without or better, are a poor and forced relationship subplot involving Saldana and a random guy she meets while in Chicago. Even though Colombiana may be a predictable female heroine revenge film (as in we know she will find the killers and get back at them), it still delivers in what it was meant to, and as that is being exciting and thrilling.",

      "reviewBody": "In star Greta Garbo&apos;s silent films especially, I think the stories are secondary to the images. They tend to be similarly melodramatic romances about adultery and love triangles and the surrounding scandals and tragedies. This one is more of a love rectangle, with Garbo&apos;s husband and the characters played by Conrad Nagel and Lew Ayres all trying to possess her. It&apos;s a generic formula, especially for the vehicles of MGM&apos;s star Garbo. Yes, there&apos;s a mystery element, but that&apos;s none too appealing, either. There&apos;s even dinner-party and courtroom scenes, and, of course, her husband is an old rotund businessman. The title cards are gushy, and the musical score, including the love theme from Tchaikovsky&apos;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; is unoriginal. Yet, the narrative does focus in some interesting and different ways on Garbo&apos;s image, and this is yet another lovely-looking late silent film, as Garbo&apos;s 1920s MGM productions tend to be. It&apos;s fortunate that Garbo, with her foreign accent, was the last of the studio&apos;s stars to transition to talkies--this being the last silent film of both Garbo and MGM--because they&apos;re some of the most deliberately gorgeous pictures of the era. They&apos;re far superior to the awkward early talkies concurrently being made by others.\n\nAppropriately, &quot;The Kiss&quot; begins with Garbo and one of her lovers in a French art gallery; from there, the film itself is a piece of visual art. Much of that is the glossy close-ups of Garbo&apos;s face, but there&apos;s an emphasis on shots of her walking and riding away from men in this one, too. There are several overhead establishing shots, superimposed images and dolly-shot transitions. The best moving camera shot is in the assault scene, with the camera pulling back after the door closes. The gunshot and phone ringing are also a better use of sound effects than in most contemporary talkies. There are two flashback scenes of this incident as narrated, or imagined, by Garbo--one is a lie and the other, presumably, is the truth. Both are filmed differently and from different angles than the first instance. The Art Deco sets are impressive, too--mainly for Garbo&apos;s home. The abstract skyscrapers design on her bedroom wall is a standout. Additionally, there&apos;s the motif of Garbo&apos;s image: Ayres wants a photograph of her, the newspapers print her image, the courtroom artists draw it, while the overall film and machinery of MGM&apos;s star making focuses on creating it. In this case, that machinery is partly of European imported artists, including Garbo herself, the director and the writer. The transition to talkies would surrender much of such foreign talent, although, fortunately, not Garbo.\n\nWith about an hour runtime, this is a relatively-brief feature and taut. For instance, when the husband has his wife tailed, it&apos;s to establish his jealous suspicions, which are sure to foreshadow later events. And when we&apos;re shown &quot;Chekhov&apos;s gun,&quot; expect it to be fired by the end.",

      "reviewBody": "Mike Leigh&apos;s superb comedy-drama of family relationships. Heart-rending, bitter and delightful by turn \n\nLeigh&apos;s modern classic captured a brace of Oscar nominations but went home empty handed in the face of The English Patient&apos;s near clean sweep. Even Blethyn&apos;s Cannes-winning performance lost out to Frances McDormand&apos;s Fargo turn (hard to challenge this decision, although in any other year the brilliant Blethyn would have deserved to win). The film eventually racked up a considerable number of awards, its Oscar success aside.\n\nThe story, every bit as believable and real as the rest of Leigh&apos;s work, centres on a woman, Cynthia Purley (Blethyn ), whose mid-life crisis is further exacerbated by the appearance on the scene of the daughter she gave away at birth, the wonderfully named Hortense Cumberbatch (Baptiste) - a young, beautiful, professional black woman who causes a few eyebrows to be raised in the family, and forces Cynthia to come to terms with her past.\n\n Alternating between high comedy, scathing one-liners (Blethyn telling daughter Rushbrook she has a face like a &quot;slapped arse&quot; is a moment to treasure) and tear-jerking poignancy, with Spall, Rushbrook and Baptiste all offering strong support, this is nothing short of superb.\n\n\n\nVerdict A genuine hit for Mike Leigh, Secrets And Lies has the coarse grain of real life, sympathetically and affirmingly fashioned."

For a long time Ladies of the Chorus was off of my radar screen. It&apos;s not seen often, video stores in my area don&apos;t have it. I missed the airings on cable or where ever. For years, I heard that this was a B picture, and one of her first pictures and not a special MM movie. So I figured this was another one of those small chances to see Marilyn similar to her early Fox appearances like &quot;We&apos;re not Married&quot; I was wrong, the critics were wrong, and people talking about the movie were wrong. MM is a featured player here in this B picture, it was great fun to see, she does some musical numbers (even if it wasn&apos;t her singing I didn&apos;t really notice) it was fun to see and I&apos;m glad I made the effort to track down this movie and buy a copy."

In fact, I almost wish that the majority of the film had dealt with this rather than the bizarre supernatural stuff.  I really do advise this film to anyone that is interested in strange cinema.  If you can get past the unfortunate flaws of the film, I think you will notice that it is actually a kind of fascinating little movie.  I have seen it many times (first back in &apos;85) and still find it a good watch (although most of my friends do not).  In other words, this movie is not for everyone, but I thought it is quite interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has been in my mind for a while because I watched it when I was a little kid and I have fond memories of it, and because I found this movie very funny in my child mind, I decided to rewatch it after more than 30 years, and after I finished Banana Joe, I realized why I found it so funny when I was a child because this movie is so silly and dumb in every sense and only a 7-year-old child can find it funny.\n\nWhen I was a child, my family had one television, and there was only one channel, so I had no choice other than Saturday cartoons. I remember this movie being frequently shown every Sunday, and it seemed fun, so I watched it. This movie was made in 1982, which is the year I was born, and I have to say its humor is not only terribly aged; it&apos;s also so juvenile and idiotic, and the editing is terribly done; unrelated scenes just merge with each other without any sense; all characters are basically cartoony caricatures or stereotypes, so actors played these characters with exaggerated manners; and the main character is big, burly, uncivilized, illiterate, and dumb as a rock banana seller. He didn&apos;t know his surname or his family; he didn&apos;t have an identification card, as an American, he also didn&apos;t know how he came to Colombia. Is he an illegal immigrant, or was he just born here? We just didn&apos;t know about this character. Plot, which is about a cartoony capitalistic dude who wants to build a factory Banana Joe&apos;s small village and our big hero tries to prevent his mission in some comedic situations and adventures are so silly and cheesy, there are also some pathetic attempts to create physical comedy, which only little kids can find funny and laugh at.\n\nIf you consider this movie a kid&apos;s movie, that&apos;s fine, but Banana Joe lasts more than 1:30 hours, so for an adult audience, it&apos;s just a waste of time. I just watched this movie for nostalgic purposes, and I don&apos;t regret spending time on this silly and stupid movie, despite the fact that I probably lost a few digits from my IQ. I also want to say that I love the exotic and tropical southern Colombian settings and catchy background music, but that&apos;s the only positive thing I can say about this outdated movie.",

The main cast members of the movie are fine but nobody really stands out. That said, &quot;Rojo&quot; does have a certain charm. This movie is never campy but its flaws somehow help the movie out.

      "reviewBody": "Well, after reading all the good reviews; some of which coming from reviewers that I often agree with, I was really looking forward to seeing The Nameless. After having sat down and watched it, however, I&apos;m really disappointed. The film is not really &apos;bad&apos;, but it&apos;s not very good either and that&apos;s a shame considering that the film clearly so much wanted to be a great thriller. The plot is not very original, though that isn&apos;t the film&apos;s main problem. Many recycled plots have sprung great movies; the main problem here is that the plot moves too slowly and it&apos;s never interesting enough to remain thrilling for the duration. The film does have a few nice ideas, though. The Nameless starts with an editor named Claudia, who goes to identify the mutilated body of her dead daughter. The body has had every trace of its identity removed and can only be identified by a bracelet and the fact that one leg was slightly shorter than the other. Five years later, however, Claudia receives a call...from her daughter, who is begging her mother to save her.\n\nDirector Jaume Balagueró, who later went on to make the even more disappointing horror thriller &apos;Darkness&apos; does manage to create a nice atmosphere for the film. Everything looks slightly grey, which makes it depressing and in turn serves the film well. I would guess that the film&apos;s main influence was David Fincher&apos;s hit &apos;Seven&apos; as the two are very similar in tone. The film was made in Spain, and that is also disappointing. Spain, along with Italy, made some of the very best thrillers in the seventies, but the recent output of this genre from both countries has been disappointing - the Italian &apos;Occhi Di Cristallo&apos; is another example of this. The recent films have lost what made them great previously, presumably because they&apos;re attempting to copy recent American films. The plot sort of drones on for the first eighty minutes as the dull characters uncover various facts and clues, and finally the film becomes interesting in the last ten minutes - though by this time, of course, it&apos;s already too late. The film was based on a good idea and it does have a few nice moments; but overall I would have to rate this as not much more than an interesting failure.",

It is very true to the storyline of the novel, which itself is not a very complex work. However it is interesting as a Chinese point of view on the relationship locals have with expats in town. I, myself, is such an expat in Shanghai through 10 years, so it is exciting to explore the point of view, where we foreign invaders become subjects under scrutiny.\n\nHowever, it is deeply unsatisfying for any purpose other than illustration the narrative of the novel. We do not gain any useful insights in the psychology involved in the Chinese point of view except from some poeticising of Coco&apos;s feelings. Furthermore the Chinese actors converse in English mostly, and when they converse in Chinese it is with a thick Beijing dialect. I ponder whether the rule is that the actors recruited who master the English language use English when together, and when actors recruited locally are involved it changes to Mandarin. This is sloppy. Reminds me of the pre WWII war movies involving multiple nationalities all from Hollywood neighborhoods.\n\nIn conclusion this work is a fake. It compels me to compare with a similar Shanghai based movie like Suzhou Creek. If you want a truer picture of Shanghai, that is where to go.",

      "reviewBody": "Just got back from having seen this wonderful film at a packed cinema and I&apos;m still smiling. It really is the most entertaining, colourful and uplifting film I&apos;ve seen for a very long time. Apart from India itself - which is a star in its own right - it is the performances from this stellar cast that really make this movie. At times it was like an acting masterclass, but never at any time could you see the cogs turning. The central characters were all wholly believable, and to be honest I find it impossible to single anyone out, although if I had to, my vote would probably go to Bill Nighy. He is just superb as Douglas - the apologetic, hesitant, henpecked husband of the self centred, bitter, scolding Jean portrayed by Penelope Wilton, who is also excellent. There is one particular scene between the two, where Douglas, for once bites back - and the emotion from Nighy is just mesmerising to watch. When you add the likes of Dames Maggie Smith and Judy Dench to the mix, the delicious Celia Imrie, Tom Wilkinson and Ronald Pickup (with an honourable mention to the latter, who brought a wonderfully rakish comedic performance to the mix) - and you can&apos;t go wrong. \n\nThe younger cast members and all the supporting players do an excellent job - but it is the oldies who steal the show. That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s an oldies film - far from it. I took my 16 year old daughter and she laughed, cried and loved it as much as I did.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a shame that 20th Century Fox has yet to have released DVD editions of many of the films of the studio&apos;s biggest star, Tyrone Power. Almost impossibly handsome, enormously popular, and with excellent acting credentials, Power nearly singlehandedly kept the studio solvent in the traumatic transition years following WWII, with costume epics like &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; showcasing his strengths.\n\n&quot;Castile&quot; echoes Power&apos;s earlier films, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; and &quot;Son of Fury&quot;, as again he plays a gallant standing against an arrogant aristocratic class, but this time he runs afoul of the Inquisition, and must flee Spain to re-establish his wealth and reputation, accompanied by loyal friend Lee J. Cobb, and a servant girl who secretly adores him (Jean Peters, in one of her best performances). Recruited into the service of the charismatic Hernando Cortez (Cesar Romero, who nearly steals the film), it&apos;s off to Aztlan (Mexico, today) with a small army to face the overwhelming but naive Aztec civilization.\n\nWhile the film frequently drifts into melodrama, shooting on location in Mexico (with the permission and support of the Mexican government), in glorious Technicolor, gives even the most mundane moments a sense of spectacle, and the cast is in top form. Worth singling out is a terrific supporting performance by Thomas Gomez, as a soldier/priest who dispenses common sense as well as religion, and helps Power realize that the woman he truly loves is not on a balcony, in Spain, but beside him, as they march towards their destiny.\n\nTwo aspects of the film deserve special recognition; Alfred Newman&apos;s score, featuring the vaulting &apos;Conquest&apos; march, is one of the finest of his long career, and is even more popular today than when the film was released; and Arthur E. Arling and Charles G. Clarke&apos;s cinematography is truly magnificent, particularly in the breathtaking finale, as Cortez&apos; forces proudly march across a broad plain, with active volcanoes in the background. Never has going &apos;on location&apos; been more justified, as the image is unforgettable! If any &apos;Powers that Be&apos; are reading this review, PLEASE offer this film on DVD, soon! And while you&apos;re at it, consider Power&apos;s other great films of the 40s and 50s; he deserves to be &apos;rediscovered&apos; by audiences, today...",

Having lost her uterus from DES poisoning, she shares a bond with the cancer victims who work in and live in the shadow of the vinyl and PVC factories.  Judith has this gravelly high voice, a quirky sense of humor, and a vulnerability in the face of corporate America that makes her irresistible.  Blue Vinyl is also beautifully and imaginatively shot...  I saw this at Sundance (2002) and Daniel Gold won the prize for documentary cinematography. There is also wonderful use of music and animation.  Highly recommended.",

But TiMER is one of those little surprising experiences that really deserve a few words of praise. It&apos;s difficult enough bringing forth something original and well written even when it isn&apos;t a rom-com.\n\nWith an interesting premise - that people can get timers telling them when they will meet their soul mate - the story follows Oona and her sister Steph, who are both nearing their thirties and have yet to find their other halves. Oona, who is to all extents and purposes the main character, goes through a series of lackluster attempts at finding someone who suits her, but the emphasis really is on how her mentality and approach are affected by the awareness that there is a path that needs to be found. When she becomes involved with a young guy, for the sake of it more than anything else, the whole debate around predestination gets a fair questioning in a balanced manner.\n\nIt&apos;s great to see nicely rounded characters who form a believable and not overly sugarcoated unit and the writing aids the actors tremendously in bringing forth this tale of love, family and family love. The film may have some weaker points, but I reckon its conviction, so to say, pays off in the end. Credit is due to the whole cast and crew for managing a fine idea into something that finds its balance early on and is capable of holding on to it until the end. The satisfaction is only greater when it comes as unexpectedly as this little obscure picture.",

And I will actually go as far as to say that you should definitely not view this as a prequel to the 2002 movie. Instead, view it as a stand-alone movie that has no ties to the 2002 movie.\n\nThis movie relies on cheap laughs, which are brought about mostly by humor well below the belt. But many times this humor just doesn&apos;t really come through properly. So it seems that it is the result of some half-hearted script writing.\n\nThe storyline in &quot;Van Wilder: Freshman Years&quot; is just not a very interesting or original one. It is all something that essentially has been seen before in similar late teen comedies. So don&apos;t count on originality being the key ingredient in this movie.\n\nFor a comedy of this type, then &quot;Van Wilder: Freshman Years&quot; was less than mediocre. And once you have seen it the first time, chances that you will return to watch it a second time are slim to none.",

It deals with rich and influential folks influencing decisions on public works for their private gain at the expense of the poorer folks and throwing minor sops at them to mitigate the anger of the affected poor.\n\nThe cinematography and expressionist montage are memorable for a 1946 film. One should realize that the director Chetan Anand was working with a crew and cast more at home with theater (IPTA) and yet made the work cinematically credible. Hats off to you, Mr Anand!\n\nA bonus is the music of Pandit Ravi Shankar, the sitar maestro.",

      "reviewBody": "In his film &quot;Truffe&quot;, starring Roy Dupuis (Charles) and Celine Bonnier (Alice), director Kim Nguyen (of the now notable Rebelle) has managed to fashion a bizarre and twisted dystopian tale isolated in a tight-knit suburb of Montreal.\n\nGlobal Warming has rendered the Hochelaga district of Montreal a hotbed for black truffle production- bringing prosperity to the community and many of the locals.\n\nBut not all is well in Hochelaga. The truffle boom has made prices bottom out, mostly due to the influence of a major &quot;fur collar&quot; corporation that has been attracted to the area with hopes of monopolizing the towns truffle supply and industry.\n\nThe corporation is, in fact, controlled by a couple of humanoid mink-controlled robots who have enslaved the local populace with parasitic mink that live in and control their hosts from their stomachs, which they&apos;ve entered via the consumption of tainted cans of corporate truffles.\n\nThe locals are then utilized- by their mink overlords, who themselves seem to be under some sort of mind control- to harvest, process, can and deliver tuffles to the local consumers (in extreme kafkaesque fashion).\n\nThe corporation does have some local competition though- in the olfactory adept Charles aka &quot;The Truffle King&quot;, whose keen sense of smell has allowed him to become a master truffle harvester. Meanwhile, his wife- Alice- runs a small cafe that serves mostly truffle-based dishes.\n\nThe plot develops when the robotic humanoid CEO&apos;s of the corporation attempt to bond and enslave Charles- with hopes of reaping the benefits of his harvesting skills- by first exploiting his dwindling financial situation (which they are largely responsible for). They not only manage to entrap him, but his parents too!\n\nWith Charles&apos; new &quot;job&quot; he starts to neglect Alice- whose cafe is suffering from the lax supply in fresh truffles. A direct result of her husband harvesting for the corporation instead of themselves.\n\nDistraught, Alice sets out to get her man back and save their business in the process. \n\nShe manages to break into the company&apos;s headquarters, where she witnesses, first hand, how the local population has been enslaved and indoctrinated by the mink-controlled robot humanoids.\n\nWhen an attempt is made on her life, it&apos;s the last stand. Time to really fight back.\n\nWielding a board-with-nails she sets out to defeat these parasitic invaders and free her beloved Charles...oh, and, unwittingly saving the town while she&apos;s at it, of course.\n\n&quot;Truffe&quot; is a truly bizarre and imaginative film that is both humorous and thought-provoking, not to mention stylish. An excellent first feature from a director who has already established himself as a pre-eminent name among Canada&apos;s new generation of filmmakers. In the end, &quot;Truffe&quot; is a short, but sweet, little cult dystopian gem. Be sure to check it out! 7 out of 10. If you enjoy this, you may want to check out Brandon (Son of David) Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;Antiviral&quot;, which is also excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "Almodovar successful and overwrought melodrama about a love/hateful relationship with the ordinary rare characters , twisted situations and eccentric events. A girl&apos;s veteran mother (Marisa Paredes) go back after 15 years abroad to perform in Madrid and to find her estranged 27-year-old daughter (Victoria Abril) who left her as a child , the latter has married one of her old boyfriends. They attempt to mend their broken mother/daughter relationship and deal with their common lover (Feodor Atkine) . The reunion after fifteen years is difficult , not least because Rebecca has married her old boyfriend . Things go wrong when there happens a crime and a rare judge (Miguel Bose) starts investigating . A mother, a daughter, a lover. Relationships can be murder.\n\nAgreeable film full of feeling , outlandish characters , haunting mood-pieces , Spanish Neo-realism , and sense of style but not totally satisfactory , including conventional pitfalls , profanities and a lot of sexual scenes . The picture deals with a veteran singer returns after 15 years abroad to perform in Madrid and finds her troublesome daughter , stablishing a physical and problematic relationship between them . It is sad and amusing , but like the rest of the movie mostly sad . This results to be an off-the-wall as well as semi-ironic melodrama , including familiar absurdities , dysfunctional roles and many other things ; featuring two feminist heroines of classical proportions . The picture is pretty well but turns out to be inferior to Almodovar&apos;s subsequent entries such as ¨The skin I live in¨, ¨Volver¨ , ¨The bad education¨ or ¨Talk to her¨. The result is undiluted scabrous drama , crazy strings of plots , sharp images , plenty of colorful images and marvellous songs from Luz Casal . Filmmaker piles up on the contrivances , turns and twisted events so that the picture to have success . It&apos;s a piquant look at a peculiar family involving strange and complicated situations during its half an hour runtime . And being influenced by American Romantic Dramas and especially by director Douglas Sirk . Nice interpretations by all cast , outstanding Marisa Paredes , Victoria abril and Miguel Bose. Furthermore , a notorious support cast such as : Anna Lizaran , Cristina Marco , Féodor Atkine ,Miriam Díaz-Aroca , Pedro Díez del Corral ,Bibiana Fernández , among others . Enjoyable musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto ; adding some wonderful songs . Brilliant and luxurious cinematography by Alfredo Mayo.\n\nThe motion picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar ; he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines , though here he directs a special melodrama , including his ordinary touches . Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters and transsexuals and along his career getting some important international prizes . His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release . In 1987, he and his brother Agustín Almodóvar established their own production company : El Deseo, S. A. The &quot;Almodóvar phenomenon&quot; has reached all over the world , making his films very popular in many countries . Oscar-winning Spanish director Pedro Almodovar who made successes such as Labyrinth of passions , Law of desire , Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown , Bad education , All about my mother , Talk to her , Broken embraces , The Skin I Live In and many others . The latest from acclaimed Spanish director , Pedro Almodovar&apos;s I&apos;m So Excited (Los Amantes Pasajeros) competing for the inaugural best European comedy honor during the upcoming 26th edition of the European Film Awards . And his last hits as Julieta and Dolor y gloria with Antonio Banderas .",

      "reviewBody": "The story is simple: boy loves girl and to get her attention he must make some sacrifices - in this case that means traveling with her to France without knowing the language or the country. The acting is wonderful, Paula as Valerie and Francois as Hendrik are very credible.\n\nThe film is very romantic, with many vivid dialogs playing charmingly with both French and German clichés. Sometimes the story seems a bit too exaggerated but most of the time this movie is very enjoyable and does a great job in recalling the viewer of his own experiences with the French language and the country - if he has them.\n\nHowever, if you don&apos;t know anything about France and never took French in school you will probably have a hard time understanding some aspects of the movie, unfortunately, those are the important aspects. Subtract those and the movie is only half as good, a romantic teenage love story with few differences to so many others. But if you have any connection to France or its language, you should see this movie, regardless if you like France or you hate it - there is stuff for both its lovers and haters.",

      "reviewBody": "Dagon tells an incredible story of terror , marine monsters and including fantastic touches. As it packs horror ,suspense , plot-twists, tension , chills , thrills with sensationalistic scenes . A shipping accident off the Galician coast of North of Spain sends the starring named Paul (Ezra Dodden) and his sweetheart Barbara (Raquel Meroño)to the decrepit fishing village called Imboca looking for help. As night falls, people start to disappear and things not quite human begin to appear. Paul finds himself chased by the entire people of Imboca . There he meets an old fisher named Ezequiel(Francisco Rabal) and a strange young girl (Macarena Gomez). Running for his life, Paul uncovers Imboca&apos;s dark secret but he is taken by the secret sect . The villagers worshipping the God Dagon and his unholy offspring are on the loose in the place .\n\nBased on two short stories by the undisputed expert of the terror H.P. Lovecraft titled ¨Dagon¨ and ¨The shadow over Innsmouth¨ . The picture packs thrills, chills , terror , fantasy and lots of blood and gore . Furthermore , unrelenting twists and turns as when the starring discovers that the truth will not set him free instead it condemns him to a waking nightmare of impressive horror . B-entertainment with a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story about an ancient fanatic religious cult of followers of Dagon. This tale about a young couple who is involved into a twisted intrigue begins well and grows more and more until a downbeat finale . Good makeup on the freakish half-human creatures by DDT that subsequently won Academy Award for ¨Pan&apos;s labyrinth¨ . Dark and colorful cinematography by Carlos Suarez and atmospheric musical score by Carles Cases that includes Galiacian sounds . The flick is finely produced by the chairman of Filmax and Castelao Productions , Julio Fernandez who along with his brother Carlos Fernandez are two successful producers and experts on Horror genre , producers of hits as ¨The machinist¨ ,¨ Fragiles¨, ¨Darkness¨, Rec 1, Rec2 and many others. The picture is compellingly directed by Stuart Gordon who along with Bian Yuzna are important American filmmakers expert on terror cinema , both of whom working for Castelao , Fantastic Factory or Filmax . Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable film , though contains some flaws.",

      "reviewBody": "One thing I really admire about Hitchcock was that he was willing to experiment, and wasn&apos;t content to make the same movie over and over. This meant that he sometimes made movies that puzzled his audiences, and several of them were out and out flops. But the passage of time has been kind to many of these movies which can be enjoyed for what they are, not what the audience WANTED them to be. &apos;The Trouble With Harry&apos; is a great example. Many of Hitchcock&apos;s movies have humour in them, but an actual comedy was a bit left field for him. And not just any kind of comedy, a very black one. Humour is very subjective, but I found this movie to very clever and a lot of fun. It gets off to a bit of a shaky start with John Forsythe&apos;s character coming out with some unfunny lines and bits of business, but once the story kicks in and the characters played by Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick are introduced, the movie becomes very amusing. Forsythe is technically the star of the movie, and Shirley MacLaine (in her movie debut) the leading lady, but Natwick, and especially Gwenn, steal the picture, and to me have the best lines. Edmund Gwenn was also in the underrated 1950s monster movie &apos;Them!&apos;, and I&apos;m really fond of him. I also get a kick out of Royal Dano who plays the sheriff. Dano was a very interesting character actor who was in everything from &apos;Moby Dick&apos; to &apos;Drum&apos; to &apos;Killer Klowns From Outer Space&apos;. To be totally honest &apos;The Trouble With Harry&apos; wouldn&apos;t make it into my Top Ten Hitchcock movies, but that is only because he made so many great ones, and it&apos;s tough to choose, not because this is poor movie. If you want an edge of your seat thriller then maybe this isn&apos;t for you, but if you thought Hitch&apos;s droll introductions on his TV show were entertaining, then you should check this one out, as it&apos;s cut from the same cloth."

      "reviewBody": "Wolf Gremm&apos;s &quot;Kamikaze 1989&quot; portrays a Germany that is rich, in which all problems are solved, where there is no pollution of the environment, where people work in sterile dust-free rooms with artificial light and air-conditioning, where alcohol is forbidden, since it causes incalculable reactions, where private persons are not allowed to grow vegetables on their own, since seeds may be contaminated, where there are, finally, no suicides anymore, but just cases of &quot;unexpected death&quot;. The whole industry is in the hand of one gigantic concern, and all of its leading crew are family members. Competition is excluded, since creativity is dangerous. Even the handful of intellectuals who are working in the &quot;cultural&quot; department of the concern, have just to confirm the &quot;intellectual&quot; doctrine of the concern. Thus, the totalitarian company represents the good, because what is good is always associated with might (cf. the definition of the &quot;axis of evil&quot;). And since everything seems to be under control, the position of the evil is empty. However, strictly speaking, good cannot exist without evil and vice versa, because these ethic terms define one another logically. However, the position of evil is empty only until the company gets a bomb threat. It seems that the &quot;spirit of evil&quot;, Krysmopompas, whose members once belonged to the &quot;prokos&quot;, the intellectuals that used to work in the hidden 31st floor of the building, are behind the threat.\n\nPolice lieutenant Jansen, unforgettably played by Rainer Werner Fassbinder in his last role, is charged with the investigation, during which the open position of Krysmopompas is offered to him several times, but he refuses to take it over. Since the concern represents the good, the police must represent the evil. Even the police president is in the hand of the concern and looks like a caricature of Dr. Mabuse turned himself into a puppet. Possibly Jansen realizes that becoming Krysmopompas and thus fulfilling the vacuum of evilness would just consolidate the omnipotent concern, because it needs the evil to define itself as the good. Consequently, the director of the concern offers him a job, which Jansen also refuses. Therefore, Jansen takes a third position in a world in which there are only two, and this is presumably the reason why the movie is called &quot;Kamikaze&quot;. However the title may be meant, this movie offers a highly complicated situation in which the categories of ethics are perverted. The typical 80ies&apos; German TV-style of this movie should not make the audience blind that in portraying paradoxical ethical categories in a world in which metaphysics has been shoveled out like the alcohol, the seeds and suicide, &quot;Kamikaze&quot; goes way beyond thematically related movies like Godard&apos;s &quot;Alphaville&quot;, Kubrik&apos;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and even Tarkovsky&apos;s &quot;Solyaris&quot;. A few years before &quot;Kamikaze 1989&quot;, Fassbinder himself had directed the science-fiction movie &quot;Welt am Draht&quot; (&quot;World on wire&quot;) which many people believe to have surpassed &quot;Solyaris&quot;. In the final scene of Kamikaze, Fassbinder says his ultimate goodbye to his audience grinning in front of a picture of Armstrong&apos;s moon landing.",

All goes wrong when David finds a photograph of a young guy (Thom Hoffman) and falls in love and decides to find the guy. Torn between his girlfriend, his controlling brother (Udo Kier) and new found love, David is destined to make a fatal choice. Helmut Berger is sometimes uneasy with the part of David which actually seems very close to some of his real life experiences. The acting is deliberately cold and distant as is the music. The cinematography , art direction and styling are very good considering the budget. It shows that the director has a vision and an eye for detail. But as a whole the film fails to impress, especially on an emotional level. It simply remains too cold and too experimental. (A more developed script with less arty dialogue would have helped as well) . Nevertheless this movie is unique and there are not many films that get made in Holland that have this sort of bravoure. Most films are uninteresting stories but without the great visuals and great music. I give it 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The interesting characters and some good performances are what keep this adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&apos;s &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; going. Many of the story details reflect the movie&apos;s source, although it has a heavier, slower tone instead of Hemingway&apos;s own economical style of writing. The scenes of hunting, bull-fighting, and combat all fit in with Hemingway&apos;s fascination with vigorous action, and the screenplay does make some use of Hemingway&apos;s &apos;leopard riddle&apos;, but not with any significant depth. Instead, it does have a lot of photography of African scenery and wildlife, which is good in itself.\n\nGregory Peck gives his usual effective performance in the lead role as Harry, a jaded writer who reflects on his past loves as he suffers through the effects of a dangerous injury. Peck fleshes out the character believably, alternating between the writer&apos;s energetic but flawed personality in the flashbacks and his increasing delirium in the present. It&apos;s a different kind of role for Peck, and he thus adapts his style somewhat from that of his more well- remembered roles.\n\nAva Gardner and Susan Hayward, along with Hildegarde Neff in a smaller part, portray the women in Harry&apos;s past and present. Gardner&apos;s ethereal elegance makes a nice contrast with Hayward&apos;s stronger screen persona, and Neff&apos;s characterization is a believable depiction of the unsuitable woman whom Harry finds during a time of despair.\n\nThe characters and the African atmosphere are the parts of the movie that work the best, and they make it worth seeing. It moves rather slowly, and occasionally expends screen time on less interesting material, or otherwise it might have been more compelling. It still leaves you with a thoughtful impression of its main characters."

      "reviewBody": "I loved the film and think it captures the essence of the TT. Guy Martin makes the whole thing watchable for all viewers because he is such a character, and he&apos;s very comical - which I don&apos;t think is intentional... and that makes it even better to watch! There are some great spinal tap moments as well.\n\nI liked the filming of fans, families, team owners as well as the riders themselves. It showed the soul of the TT, rather than usual attempts of a bike film with bad-ass bikers and heavy metal music. Thank goodness this film didn&apos;t that way! Saying that, I think the film could have been an epic but fell just short. The following are niggles, to what is a &apos;must-see&apos; film;\n\nThere is some amazing footage which never made it into the film - from 2010 and past races. Ryan Farquhar was on the limit that year, as well as Michael Dunlop - watching them fighting to stay in control of their bikes was simply breathtaking. Also, there are regular on-board overtakes with the front wheel in the air at 140+mph (due to rises on the road) shows the extremes of the riding... all this action seemed to be missed. Although, don&apos;t get me wrong, there is plenty of action... but more could have gone in.\n\nThere are incredible photographs that were not shown (to capture moments too fast to see in film). These also show the extremes of the TT - bikes bottoming out their suspension to scrape their fairings on the road, and riders brushing the walls with their helmets and leathers etc. etc.\n\nContrast all that with the fans sipping tea, or having a nap in a field shows the TT is a race that deserves a world audience. I think the extremes could have been played a bit better.\n\nAs another reviewer says, some of the solo footage of Guy on a bike was pretty lame, and so out of context to the rest of the film. I also think some of the pre-race (testing) preparation footage could have been shortened giving more time to the action and history...\n\nStill, the film is great, and I will be a buying it on DVD/Blueray as soon as it is available.",

The concept of people from thousands of years ago being killed and buried in the bogs was interesting. Them reanimating just out of the blue and seeking out a specific kind of person, that&apos;s a little iffy. Also the fact that all of these people just happen to converge on this same cottage on the same day is just too much coincidence as is not having phone service when they were apparently only about three miles from a road. I did not like the little love connection they felt needed to be in the movie. It added nothing to the story. This is in no way a horror movie. It is more something that is based on a false lore that has been told for years. Seeing Vinnie Jones was it&apos;s only redeeming feature.",

      "reviewBody": "Our Blushing Brides - another in the early black/white ensemble films with Joan Crawford and Anita Page- this one came along just in time for talkies. Joan is Geraldine March, Anita is Connie Blair, and Dorothy Sebastian is Francine Daniels, all chasing their various men. This one also has Hedda Hopper as Mrs. Ross-Weaver, and a dashing 26 year old Robert Montgomery as Tony Jardine. Crawford would work with Hedda Hopper in &quot;The Women&quot; in 1939, which also featured fashion shows that take place in a store where they work.... Also present is an 18 year old Ann Dvorak as one of the models, and Louise Beavers, from Imitation of Life, as the dresser. Geraldine and Francine prance around in tight dresses and slips, a sure sign that the movie code wasn&apos;t being enforced yet. Way too much time is spent on the fashion shows, in a Busby Berkeley-like synchronized dance around the pool. Later, Geraldine wears a blond wig, and speaks with a stilted, proper accent that wasn&apos;t there before, I guess to impress her rich new suitor, Tony (Montgomery). As the girls have their ups and downs, they all lean on Geraldine. Good performances by all, except that near the end, Joan starts doing her big, overdone facial expressions that were so necessary in all her silent films.",

      "reviewBody": "Summed up, Mike Flanagan made a deep, multilayered yet beautiful film about the value of life. It&apos;s really hard to explain but Flanagan does not waste a single shot. There is a narration throughout the movie, yet right from &apos;Act Three,&apos; everything seen and experienced unfolds perfectly in &apos;Act One.&apos; Ejiofor &amp; Gillan are fantastic in Act Three but if The Life of Chuck is to be nominated for anything, it has to be the sound. From the cosmic elements in &apos;Act Three&apos; to the dancing scenes in &apos;Acts Two &amp; One,&apos; Flanagan did an exceptional job incorporating the sound throughout.\n\nOf course, everyone was focusing on Hiddleston and his character, but Tom even mentioned it was really a team effort in Act Two and Annalise Basso, Hiddleston&apos;s dance partner in Act Two, and Taylor Gordon (who is in the credits as The Pocket Queen), the busker, all three combined with their choreographers Mandy Moore &amp; Stephanie Powell really make the dance scene sing. Taylor Gordon is a talent in herself in her brief, but excellent role.\n\nWhat surprised me was how Act One was with young Chuck and no one talks about how excellent the kids were. Their performances were just as brilliant as the adults, if not more so when young Chuck receives a very haunting monologue from his grandfather (an unbelievable Mark Hamill) about certain choices in life. Act One really helps put the puzzle together that was Act Three, where the cosmic elements can be off-putting, but it all serves a purpose. Stephen King is right when he says The Life of Chuck is one of the good ones. The spirit and energy is felt from beginning to end, and with all on board performances giving their best, Flanagan is further establishing himself as one of contemporary&apos;s greater directors.\n\nOne thing I will say is The Life of Chuck is dedicated In Memory to Scott Wampler. And there are a few cameos in The Life of Chuck but Scott&apos;s inclusion just tugged me right at the heart. Great film.",

      "reviewBody": "While watching this film I found my attention slipping from time to time. At other moments I was thoroughly enjoying myself. So my reaction to this film is mixed.\n\nTwo eccentric young women, Rannvá and Barba, come to their native Faroer to find some connection with their past and their families. In the beginning of the film it seems, because of the women&apos;s erratic and provocative behaviour, that their only objective is to show the local inhabitants how extremely boorish and unsophisticated they (the locals) are. But through a series of seemingly unrelated events and persons we learn more about the history of both characters and the seriousness of their quest for belonging.\n\nAccompanied by their faithful driver Rúni, who himself is on a quest for work in an interesting but never fully realized sub-plot, they drive through the beautiful Faroer landscape. Their moods swing from the deeply tragic to the highly exhilarated.\n\nIt is in these exhilarated moments that the girls really come to life and for me these were the scenes that I found most enjoyable. A feeling of genuine fun is transmitted through the TV-screen (I missed this one in the cinema) and this made me really like these women.\n\nThe tragic scenes seemed to me a little over the top and did not feel very genuine, too much like two actresses desperately trying to convey an emotion they do not feel at that moment. It was in these moments that my attention wandered from the screen and it is here that I think this movie is mostly unconvincing.\n\nAll in all still a very enjoyable, nicely paced film with good camera work and editing, conveying a slight sense of disorientation which helps in evoking the spirit the women are in.",

      "reviewBody": "I try and give low-budget sci-fi films more leeway to see without costly special effects if some nuggets of cleverness or originality can be found. Unfortunately, what I saw here came across as way too murky, obtuse, and nonsensical, for my tastes.\n\nTold in a slow-paced and surrealistic manner, the story, from what I could garner, revolves around a nefarious and mysterious company, called Brand New-U, that apparently abducts or beats people into submission, to take them to their headquarters. Once there, they are transformed into a new version of themselves (or identical) via a type of hypnosis, brainwashing, and surgery. For what exact purpose this is done never really became clear to me, but there is a mention of rich benefactors of the corporation who believe a better human being can emerge. Huh?\n\nThe two stars of the movie have good screen presence but their talents, in my opinion, can&apos;t be realized within this dense plot. Simon Pummell handles the writing and direction, and just what he had in mind escapes me, I&apos;m sorry to say.\n\nAll in all, this sci-fi flick didn&apos;t work for me at any level, and I would recommend not to waste your time here with this one.",

      "reviewBody": "Though this story sounds like a cheesy teenage fairy tale attempt, it is something quite the contrary. The &apos;girl who finds out she is a princess&apos; story, has been most certainly covered, but this makes you forget about it being a fairy tale cliché.\n\nAll thanks to Anne Hathaway, who just sizzled as Mia  her cool/ funny tone of voice and personality, just made her picture perfect. It was as is she was just born to play it. In the end, this movie ranked no.19 in the top 20 movie list of the year 2001, grossing more than 100 million at the box office.something which it completely deserved. Julie Andrews, makes a sudden re-appearance as Queen Clarise. Though she does fit perfectly to what the casting director&apos;s envisage of the Queen, there is something that does not fit, to make it perfect. However, that does not stop anyone from not enjoying the movie and having fun. Mandy Moore&apos;s debut performancewell was HORRIBLE (listen to her cover version of &apos;Stupid Cupid&apos;- its even worst than her acting)! But because Anne Hathaway&apos;s character was brought out with a lot of strength, all these minor faults seemed invisible. Hector Elizondo was equally good as the chauffeur Joe. He had wit and the personality. Heather Matarazzo always plays a freak, and in this case, it is still the same.\n\nThis may be a kiddie movie, but I believe it was made for everyone to enjoy it- and it did serve it&apos;s purpose. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH and would make a great recommendation, for anyone who just wants to make movie night fun."

The story is one of the most famous books in The Netherlands, and Martin Koolhoven did a great job on making it to a movie.\n\nThe camera positions were very good and he really gives the war-feeling, what isn&apos;t nice, but improves the reality. Not only the sets and camera positions were good, but I was also very surprised on the acting of almost all actors. Very good casting and I think we found some new talent. The way Koolhoven puts the adultery against the adolescence is so good. Especially on the end, since the ending isn&apos;t that nice, still it gives you a good feeling. Also the music was beautiful and fits perfect. Good job!",

They went out to hang out with the crowd in the evening, but a little boy who doesn&apos;t belong to the occasion suddenly appears, so the memories and secrets behind the boy&apos;s sorrow face start to get revealed.\n\nThis first feature by the Finnish female director Zaida Bergroth is based on a play by Antti Raivio. It&apos;s Raivio&apos;s semi-autobiography, so it would never be easy for anyone to interpret his own very personal story, but Ms Bergroth proved herself a good storyteller and told the story very subtly.\n\nIt was a family full of Joy, until one day the older brother Rupert found a letter left on the floor, and everything would never be the same. It&apos;s not a very special story to tell, but it&apos;s a story which everyone would feel connected to in each their own perspective. Personally, I felt deeply connected to the situation and profoundly moved by the feelings that couldn&apos;t be shown in the characters.\n\nMs Bergroth not only fully transformed the play into a cinematic experience but also brilliantly used a few very imaginative metaphors to lead the audience to get into the story deeper and deeper, but it still maintains a clear view when the memories and the present shuffle through back and forth. It also has some funny scenes that decrease the heavy tone.\n\nThe ensemble cast is impressive. especially the two young actors who played the brothers are amazingly good. They reminded me of the equally good sisters in &quot;In America.&quot; The use of the song &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; and a cover of &quot;You Don&apos;t Have to Say You Love Me&quot; fit the scenes perfectly and make the film more unforgettable.",

      "reviewBody": "I cannot forget the theme music of &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; by Dave Grusin. There&apos;s a certain pervading peacefulness listening to its strains. Watching the film again on cable reminded me how impressed I was when I first saw it. Ever since, I kept an eye on movies with Alan Arkin in it -- his performance as John Singer, a deaf-mute, was sensitively delivered and commanded respect. It was Sondra Locke&apos;s debut appearance. She was young and slim, perfect for the role of &quot;Mick&quot;, who learned to accept his disability and was able to share her love of music with him. \n\nAlong this life&apos;s journey of Singer, his friends included Chuck McCann as the plump fellow deaf-mute, who&apos;s playful and loved chocolates; Stacy Keach as the recovering alcoholic and new found chess mate; Percy Rodriguez as the self-righteous black Doctor who has his strife and discords with his daughter Portia, portrayed by a young Cicely Tyson. Lessons in diversity and tolerance are subtly evident as the story progresses. The ending is certainly not of Hollywood standard. Cinematographer James Wong Howe certainly tied in hope through his lens on the final shot with Mick (Sondra Locke) in it.   \n\nThis film about reaching out and touching someone, irrespective of one&apos;s ability to verbally communicate or via signs, of one&apos;s race, color, or background, still rings true.",

Being released the same year as Octopussy starring Roger Moore, this one titled Never Say Never Again was clearly made outside Pinewood Studios and was never an official 007 film but a remake of Thunderball. Connery delivers a usually convincing performance as Bond but was looking older at 53, the film isn&apos;t always good. It&apos;s almost all-cast with lots of womanizing in evidence that makes him extremely seedy and neither does he raise much suspicion. The reason why Connery made this one was to stick the guns on Albert R Broccoli. As a result, Connery felt that Broccoli diid a very poor job with Diamonds Are Forever and why Broccoli choosed to leave out some of the important editing work is beyond. There are some plus points about Never Say Never Again particularly the Pat Roach scene and the topical seaside settings but on the other hand it&apos;s alrightish.",

      "reviewBody": "Given the bad reputation of Chinese martial arts films in general, plus the undeniable fact that many of these - including this one - use genre conventions originally developed for the popular stage (what has been called &quot;Chinese Opera&quot; is actually more analogous to American Vaudeville), it is only with considerable effort that an admirer if these films can persuade Americans to watch these movies, let alone appreciate them fully. But the point really is, that the directors of these films use what they have to portray the culture in which they live in a manner as completely cinematic as can be found in any national film tradition.\n\nAll this is a warm up to this: The One-Armed Swordsman is as masterful a film as Kurosawa Akira&apos;s Yojimbo.\n\nI make this specific comparison because each film was made within a genre to which the film contributes genre-shattering innovation, while at the same time maintaining certain essential conventions that keep it safely within the genre. Thus Kurosawa&apos;s renegade ronin is a tough, cynical, manipulator of the various villains of the film, in a way even the most tragic hero of the Japanese samurai film (chambara) of the time could never be; nonetheless, he still manages to kill everyone at the end, much like all the other chambara heroes.\n\nSimilarly, Chang Cheh&apos;s One-Armed hero follows genre convention by performing super-human feats of skill (like leaving the imprint of his hand on a rock with a single blow), but just as a character, he is completely new.\n\nThe typical wu xia film of the time generally had an aristocratic hero; if he had no personal problems to deal with, he always wore white. If he had personal problems, he would drink heavily and dress like a mendicant monk. He was in utter thrall to whatever worthiest female was in his immediate vicinity; his cause was always to uphold the right, protect chastity, and further the well-being of the Chinese people as a whole. His one real defect (as a &quot;type&quot;) was that he really liked fighting, which usually got him into trouble with those with similar enjoyments.\n\nChang Cheh&apos;s Feng Kong (as played by Wang Yu in what is his finest role) is not an aristocrat, but an orphaned son of a servant; he doesn&apos;t wear white, he wears black; remaining loyal to her father (his former teacher) he grows to hate the young lady who chopped off his arm (I certainly would) and grows attached to the dead warrior&apos;s daughter (with whom he sleeps without marriage) only after she has nursed him back to health - but he remains determined to control his own fate nonetheless. The future of the Chinese people doesn&apos;t interest him. Eventually, he abjures fighting and goes off to become a farmer.\n\nAs can be discovered from various interviews, Chang Cheh, in filming what is still his most completely realized vision, was perfectly aware that he was making such innovations. In fact, in terms of traditional Chinese culture alone, The One-Armed Swordsman comes across as a radical Confucian demand for recognition of merit above social status; and of the need for social stability over and against any desire for personal revenge.\n\nFurthermore, Chang Cheh pulls this off in a manner utterly consistent with the social trends of the 1960s - Feng Kong is portrayed as an &quot;angry young man&quot; - the representative of an entire generation fed up with many of the myths of the old culture to which they have been indoctrinated. He is brazen, energetic, honest, and more than a little suspicious of old prejudices (which have never favored him anyway). And having been told that he was not &quot;born worthy&quot;, he sets out to proves that he can learn self-sufficiency without the benefit of institutional education. He doesn&apos;t need to start a revolution - he IS a revolution.\n\nOf course, if the general quality of the film as a whole were not utterly top-notch, this message would be meaningless. But the camera-work, supporting performances by the other actors, staging and direction, and most of the editing are all &quot;world-class&quot; - as good as anything coming out of Hollywood that decade, and better than any Hollywood film of the decade&apos;s latter half.\n\nLet the genre conventions be what they are, and pay respect to one of the best films of its type - and perhaps one of the finest films ever made, world-wide.",

      "reviewBody": "Typhon Sur Nagasaki is one of the most surprising masterpieces of the &apos;50s.I wasn&apos;t expecting something so good,and so tasty.This is the actor that was Marais!This is the actress that Mrs. Darrieux was!\n\nIncandescent and hurtful love,intensity,sharp and realist psychology,typhoon,exoticism,intentness.Nothing has aged;everything is perfectly up to date.\n\nShocking,original,unconventional,lucid,without illusions,surprising.\n\nTyphon Sur Nagasaki denotes perspicacity,shows intelligence,brio and taste.It has much gusto.\n\nThe colors of this fruity movie are marvelous.\n\nThe way Typhon Sur Nagasaki uses the spectacular (the typhoon) is intelligent,far-reaching and fascinating.The movie also makes some use of embellishments:cheap tricks of touristic advertising,ready-made &quot;exoticism&quot;,facile lures (a Japanese dinner,ceremonies at a temple,a Golliwog show,etc.,everything that pleases the ordinary tourist).It is stupefying the very intelligent and creative way all these are used.\n\nThe high level is kept up constantly.Yves Ciampi makes a vivid and suspenseful work of intensity and psychology and acute observations and truth, out of ordinary exotic and touristic ingredients. The skilled director does not dodge the ingredients of banal, ungrateful touristic advertising exoticism; on the contrary,this courageous man builds with such ordinary ingredients,he uses them amazingly.This is a shocking aesthetic defiance.\n\nThe debonair engineer is a lordly,sinewy man,always well-dressed (Marais looked good with his red shirts and leather jacket).His ex-mistress,who arrives from France,wants to gain him back.She eats humble pie.Marsac hopes,at first,to be able to get off lightly.But little by little,he actually slides in her arms again.Things begin to look squally.\n\nAs Marsac,Marais outstrips by far Bogart&apos;s acting in &quot;Casablanca&quot;.\n\nMrs. Darrieux&apos;s role ,as a selfish,self-assertive,full-length woman in heats,and a good-looker,is surpassing,and outweighs the &quot;bitches in heats&quot; roles made by Mrs. Taylor or Mrs. Leigh.\n\nAll the actors give knock-out performances (Keiko Kishi,Fröbe).\n\nThe scriptwriter,the director,the actors (Mrs. Darrieux,Mrs. Keiko Kishi),the music are jewelery.\n\nTyphon Sur Nagasaki gave me what I wished,and fully.\n\nThe movie has also a strange dimension,alluded to by Typhon Sur Nagasaki &apos;s lapidary motto taken from Kipling.\n\n&quot;House of Bamboo &quot;,&quot;Sayonara&quot;,&quot;Hiroshima...&quot;,&quot;Typhon Sur Nagasaki&quot;.\n\nSeeing &quot;Nagasaki&quot;,I also understood why I didn&apos;t like &quot;Casablanca&quot;:I was awaiting for something else,and this something else is &quot;Nagasaki&quot;,I was waiting for Marais and Mrs. Darrieux.\n\nI already was very fond of Marais;since &quot;Nagasaki&quot;,I am a fan of Mrs. Darrieux,also.\n\nIt is unfair that the man who did Typhon Sur Nagasaki came to be known for ...Fantomas and ...Le Bossu.\n\n(Prior to seeing &quot;Typhon Sur Nagasaki &quot;,my favorite Marais show was,since I was 13 years old,in &apos;92,&quot;Balsamo&quot;,that was so much fun.)"

Firstly, Armand Assante&apos;s performance as mafioso can never go wrong.  His cocky, charismatic portrayal of an ex-mobster in the witness protection program is definitely alluring.\n\nThe redheaded neighbor recognizes and falls for him, you feel happy for her as she&apos;s in dead-end marriage, and the chemistry between her and Armand is apparent! (I kept thinking . . . if only that could happen to me).\n\nLike I said, it&apos;s not filled with the extreme gritty substance of &quot;Gotti&quot;, but it is fun and even has some Pulp-Fiction-like dark-comedic scenes -- that, and Armand&apos;s performance along with the sexual chemistry make this - I feel - a very worthwhile watch!"

We really do get a sense of how this harsh, flinty landscape shapes the people who live in it and how the customs and structures of modern (city) life would feel so foreign to them. The use of chiarscuro lighting in darker scenes, figures set amidst the cathedral lighting of the forest, and the imposing presence of Michele filmed looking upward as he is framed against harsh, white, rocky hillsides and the bottomless gray sky, give a sense of the inherent drama that lies in these people&apos;s day to day survival. Unfortunately the drama of the simple, predictable, and yet intrusive plot can&apos;t match that of the landscape and the film&apos;s pace is occasionally plodding (we literally spend a third of the film watching sheep being driven up and down hillsides). My review: a shrug. But worth a look if you want to learn something about this out-of-the-way corner of the world. 6/10.",

      "reviewBody": "The story is about a man who along with his wife n son takes a weekend off n head to an isolated house to cut off from the city n work life stress. On the way, the man hits a deer who was running away from some hunters. After being towed n reaching the house, the man notices bullet stuck in the wall n a hole in the window. The next morning the family goes to a store where the boy is given an idol of wendigo, a so called creature by a Red Indian...... This film is utterly boring. Nothing happens. Most of the scenes r shot in the dark n to add to the turmoil, the shaky cam stuff is even more irritating. Ther is zero kills, no gore, tension n suspense is lacking n forget bah the lousy sex scene with nada nudity. Generous with 5 cos of decent acting n a lil eerie atmosphere. Saw this recently for the first time.",

Fonda&apos;s infatuated with bareback rider Dorothy Lamour but eventually realizes he was meant for the country girl. Darnell and Lamour look beautiful, especially in Technicolor. Really, the whole picture looks good. The problem is the story is dull and some of the acting is sub-par. Considering this cast, I expected better. Darnell&apos;s often spotty so I wasn&apos;t phased by her weak performance. But I was disappointed in Henry Fonda, whose rube routine was annoying. He reunites with his Grapes of Wrath costars John Carradine and Jane Darwell, both of whom are fine in this. Dorothy Lamour stands out the most. I wish I could recommend it but unless you&apos;re a Fonda, Lamour, or Darnell completist I wouldn&apos;t waste my time on it. Watchable but dull.",

      "reviewBody": "In the land of bad movies, this movie would be at least a duke.  First of all, it is very clear that half of this movie is from stock footage.  It is also clear that they used multiple takes of the same scene (or maybe it was actually the same take) a few different times in the movie.  Good guy rounds the corner, shoots two bad guy.  Same good guy, same corner, two minutes later, shoots two more bad guys.  Same corner a few minutes later...  Then there are the scenes where you see someone shooting on one set, and blowing someone up on a different set entirely.\n\nThen there was the acting.  Even without the movie being dubbed the acting was terrible.  It is like watching the first earliest rehearsals of an elementary school play.  The only people who don&apos;t entirely underact are the ones who entirely overact!\n\nHow about the set?  With a name like Bronx Executioner, taking place (supposedly) in the south Bronx in the relatively new future, you would expect to see a city.  Or at least a run down city.  Or at least the ruins of a city.  Nope.  There are beat up looking factories in the middle of dirt fields.  A castle in the middle of the woods.  Another scene seems to take place in a quarry...  No cities anywhere, a couple of country roads through he middle of nowhere, and a couple of beat up looking factories, that&apos;s it.\n\nAlso, going to the plot of the movie...  This is a movie about the humanoids fighting the androids.  Both humanoids and androids are factory reject robots.  So of course when they get shot they bled.  Okay, some of them spark a little bit, but that is more muzzle flash than anything.  Basically they all look human, and act human (alright they act like bad actors trying to act like robots trying to act human) and there is no way to tell they aren&apos;t human in the movie.  Well, one guy does die and reveal some circuits where the gaping hole in his neck appeared.  Of course, you couldn&apos;t see a head or a body in that one shot, so it is hard to tell.  Also they were really fragile robots.  I mean when a human can kill a robot with a couple of karate chops you know they are weak.  Also in all the slaughter scenes, there are never any wounded.  They are all either dead, or escaped.  The only robot to even last a few seconds after they got fatally wounded was a &quot;good guy&quot; robot who got to say something &quot;human&quot;.\n\nPersonally I hate MST3K, but this movie is perfect for that sort of treatment.  Or better yet, redub the whole movie to be a comedy instead. Some of the stuff that happens in this movie is just too funny not to be made fun of.  Like the good guy robot goes to the sheriff for help.  The sheriff says that he is staying out of it.  Both actors just stand there waiting while the earlier soundbite that says he has to help those who ask gets played back.  Then he immediately apologizes and agrees to help.  &quot;No I can&apos;t help you, i can&apos;t get involved.... [pause for soundbite]...  I&apos;m sorry, I will help you.&quot;\n\nThis movie is truly spectacularly bad.",

He hardly ever set a foot wrong, and &apos;Executive Suite&apos; is vintage Wise.\n\nMr. Bullard, bullying president of a huge furnishing corporation, dies, leaving everyone in doubt as to who should take over. The vultures are closing in, the major stockholder, a loose canon, is shamelessly wooed, dirty deals are struck, and there is even some insider trading taking place. It sure ain&apos;t pretty, but it&apos;s the name of the game and anything goes.\n\nRobert Wise sets a steady pace, a brisk, business-like unfolding of a drama that deserves comparison with Shakespeare. It is done with quick cutting, drab, corporate sets, and filled to the brim with those covert glances that, in the end, decide the outcome. &quot;Efficiency has become a dirty word, budget control has a bad odor&quot;, says prospective new manager Fredric March (another brilliant, Oscar-worthy performance) when he senses that he is losing the battle, and young gun William Holden rises to the occasion with an attention-grabbing speech that is not likely to be quickly forgotten: &quot;We will never again ask a man to do something to poison his pride in himself or his work&quot;.\n\n&apos;Executive Suite&apos; is an ensemble film, and one could go on praising every single member of the cast. And yet Robert Wise remains the engineer of this masterpiece of dynamic and still highly relevant cinema.",

It&apos;s not him that rivet us but his circumstances. And the circumstances are truly riveting, terrifying, unpredictable and gloriously cinematic. Dennis Hopper is superb, disgustingly so and Isabella Rossellini creates a character that was totally new to me. Related to many others but new, disturbingly so. Dean Stockwell has a moment that I know already will stay in my mind for ever. I&apos;m so glad I finally saw it.",

      "reviewBody": "This version of &apos;Alice in Wonderland&apos; (a co-production between the UK and France) suffered from being released around the same time as the Disney cartoon with little advertising; and through being suppressed from release in the UK due to the portrayal of Queen Victoria in the early pre-fantasy scenes.\n\nIt was also filmed in Ansocolor, a process which has not travelled well if the print in the archives is anything to go by. Carol Marsh is an OK Alice, but looks older than she should be - the puppets are mainly hideous and would be frightening to children (especially the Mock Turtle, the Duchess, and the Mouse Alice encounters in the lake of tears). I did like the footmen-fish however and the combination of live action with puppet work, if a bit creaky, does have charm.\n\nAt the start of the film, we meet the dons of Oxford and the Queen (the Vice-Chancellor then becomes the White Rabbit, the Queen is the Queen of Hearts, with the same actors providing the voices). The switch into the &apos;Wonderland&apos; story proper comes with a boat trip in which the stuttering Dodgson entertains the Liddel girls to compensate from them missing the visit of the Queen to Oxford.\n\nThere is much to enjoy in this film - the score is good, if a little saccharine, the puppets are memorable (although one or two, especially the Caterpillar, compare unfavourably with their Disney counterparts), and the story still has charm. There is also enough humour to entertain adult audiences while the main story enthrals their children. Recommended, if hard to track down these days."

William is informed that his unknown son William Canfield Jr. (Buster Keaton) will arrive by train from Boston to visit him. When Willie arrives, William trains him to work with him in his ship. However, Willie meets his friend Marion King (Marion Byron), the daughter of James King, and they date each other, against the will of their fathers. When a hurricane reaches River Junction, Willie rescues his father and his future father-in-law from the river.\n\n&quot;Steamboat Bill Jr.&quot; has a silly but funny beginning, and an amazing hurricane sequence, with very bold scenes. The timing and the physical capability of Buster Keaton are very impressive, and in the present days it is impossible to imagine shooting the scenes in the storm without the use of computer, so convincing they still are. From his biography, I have seen that he died of lung cancer, not in an accident as I might guess, meaning that he has survived to his risky scenes usual in most of his films. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Marinheiro de Encomenda&quot; (&quot;Sailor by Order&quot;)",

That&apos;s literally to a point, where you may recognize where some of the inspiration has been drawn from. But it has enough to say on its own too.\n\nIt may seem cliché at points in the story and you may feel like you&apos;ve seen similar things before, but it&apos;s tough to be completely original. It&apos;s hard enough to be good in what you&apos;re trying to say. And this makes a lot of points about living and dying. And being able to accept things. Some things do not translate as good though and it&apos;s tough for the main actor to convey certain feelings that none of us have gone through (to that extend). Still more than solid and very gripping",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know why, but people on imdb and elsewhere have been very critical of this film. Personally, as someone living in Hong Kong, I think it is both a well made and important film. At the end, the analogy of Gong Li&apos;s character starting again, as Hong Kong is starting again, worked well. I think perhaps the only drawback is Maggie Cheung&apos;s character, as it seems a little pointless. However, I like nearly everything Jeremy Irons is in - he is really one of the world&apos;s best actors. His characters are always people that I can somehow empathise with - they&apos;re always very believable and he really carries the film&apos;s themes. The idea of setting the film in the six months leading up to Hong Kong&apos;s July 1, 1997 handover works well. As Irons&apos; character dies, so does British sovereignty - the Union Jack goes down, the last Governor cries, Gong Li shakes off her long-time sugar daddy. It&apos;s a captivating and well-told story of which the Director should be proud, although I read an interview with him a while ago, and he didn&apos;t want to talk about the film, since it&apos;s upset some people in Hong Kong, I think. This film is certainly better than most rubbish that&apos;s made in Hong Kong. I urge you to find a copy and see it.",

We&apos;re both relatively fundamental Christians, and myself am very familiar with Frank Peretti since he wrote &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; in the late 80&apos;s. I will be recommending this movie to other believers I work with. It holds the viewer&apos;s attention, and alludes to a few New age religious areas that are not so healthy. Yoga being one of them. Sort of risky to do that and the truth may be painful to some. Predictable ending but hey, we know the end of the big story anyway. See it.",

Yes, this the world of spaghetti westerns where the lines between Good, Bad and Ugly are thin, indeed. Manuel kills Django&apos;s girlfriend (Loredana Nusciak, known from the original &quot;Django&quot;), which sets Django&apos;s mind back on his original idea of bounty hunting... This movie is quite obviously inspired by &quot;Django&quot;, although it&apos;s not an official sequel. Shot just one year later, it casts Loredana Nusciak in a similar part, and Gianni Garko looks more like Franco Nero than like himself in other movies. If you remember Garko as the screaming lunatic in &quot;Mille dollari sul nero&quot;, or as the gambler and gunman with all the funny lines in &quot;Buon funerale amigos&quot;, he proves to be versatile as an actor here. If you are into Italian westerns, you won&apos;t be disappointed by this movie. Only silly thing: Claudio Camaso (as Manuel) put on so much mascara like he was going to play the baddie in a silent movie.",

      "name": "A science fiction film that gives the genre a run for its money",
      "reviewBody": "Beyond the entrapment of lavish special effects (for which &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot; won an Oscar anyway), few science fiction films actually present a good story, much less one that makes you think and/or presents new ideas.  &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot; is one of those few.\n\nBefore &quot;Stars Wars&quot; enraptured audiences with its stunning special effects and created a precedent for a string of similarly effects-laden knock-offs and genre wanna-be&apos;s (mirroring what &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; had done for audiences in the 50&apos;s), true science fiction films such as &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot; were giving us stories simply complimented by special effects, not about them.  I say &quot;true&quot; because &quot;Star Wars&quot; is of the fantasy genre; it is not a science fiction story, though it does share some common elements.\n\n&quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot; presents us with a vivid, somewhat horrifying vision of a possible future.  It doesn&apos;t take place &quot;a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.&quot;  It happens on earth in a believable time frame.  It doesn&apos;t ask us to greatly suspend disbelief by accepting alien races and magic powers. Instead, it presents us with a chilling fast forward of our own technology, attitudes, and policies.  Concerning the latter, the film includes an almost creepy euthanasia undertone to it.\n\nThough, in all honesty, I care more about and become more closely associated with the characters in &quot;Star Wars,&quot; the disassociation I feel for LR&apos;s characters somewhat aids the lack of individuality that the story tries to convey.  The actors, however, give great performances.\n\nBeautiful cinematography and settings greatly compliment the film&apos;s mood and timeframe, from the sterile domed city to the decimated Washington D.C., which still provides one of (if not) the best visuals of a post-apocalyptic world that I&apos;ve ever seen.  It&apos;s right there with &quot;The Planet of the Apes&apos;&quot; Statue of Liberty.\n\nAnother thing that SW does well is disassociate itself from the decade in which it was created.  You have to overlook this aspect in LR because like so many films of the 70&apos;s, it carries its decade&apos;s time stamp.\n\nThough minor, another thing I, in particular, enjoy about LR are the weapons.  Unlike every other weapon in and out of science fiction history, LR&apos;s &quot;blasters&quot; do not actually shoot anything.  There is simply an explosion at their designated target.  It may be campy (or corny), but it&apos;s definitely different and a fine example of real, working props.\n\nAnother interesting note: the film varies greatly from the original novel, but most people agree that the film is much better.  I tend to agree with them.\n\nFor me, in terms of science fiction, &quot;Logan&apos;s Run&quot; takes its place among such decade-defining films as &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (50&apos;s) and &quot;The Planet of the Apes&quot; (60&apos;s) and among such thought-provoking science fiction as &quot;Soylent Green&quot; and &quot;Gattaca.&quot;\n\nAsk yourself this: what or where is &quot;sanctuary?&quot;  Isn&apos;t that what we&apos;re all looking for?  Answer both, and you&apos;ll have the film&apos;s theme.",

      "reviewBody": "A wonderful modern Hänsel and Gretel version by Francois Ozon, one of today&apos;s most interesting French filmmakers. Natacha Regnier (La vie rêvée des anges) is most impressive as the scheming and unscrupulous, yet at the same time strangely innocent and childlike schoolgirl Alice who brings her impotent boyfriend Luc (not-so impressive, though ok Jérémie Renier) to killing their handsome Arab schoolmate Said she is lusting for. As for her motivations, the Rimbaud quote (&quot;Un crime!...&quot;) in one of the flashback scenes seems to tell the most about it. Maybe she also hates Said because he is sexually aggressive and at the same time very desirable to her - so he doesn&apos;t give her that complete control she has with Luc who is none-menacing to her in any way whatsoever.\n\nAs for Luc, whose internal development we follow the closest in the story, I don&apos;t know  exactly why he is able to perform sexually in the end (in a scene that seemed to me a kind of parody to 70s softcore porn movies) when first he couldn&apos;t. It is true, Alice was menacing and even false to him (in the beginning, she tells the blindfolded Luc that she has taken off her bra when in fact she hasn&apos;t, then she photographs him half naked and tells him playfully she would send the pictures to his parents) - but then, the Man of the Woods (Serbian actor Miki Manojlovic - it makes sense that this strange character is played by a foreigner) seems also to be dangerous, doesn&apos;t he? Or is it that the Man (contrary to Alice) doesn&apos;t expect anything of him, only to stay calm and let go - that&apos;s why this in neither way attractive person is the first Luc is able to enjoy sex with?\n\nAs for Luc and Said, someone here has mentioned that Luc may desire Said for himself. Though this never gets clear, but there is a tell-tale scene when Luc goes to Said&apos;s boxing class and watches him for an important period of time, while we hear strange, hymnical music on the background score. This may indicate that Luc is indeed attracted to his sexy schoolmate, though he also &apos;knows&apos; that Said and his friends did terrible things to Alice (things the girl made up in order to convince Luc to take part in the killing).\n\nI also found the motif of the rabbits very interesting: rabbits here are exchangeable for people, as the same things happen to human beings as to these animals. A rabbit gets killed and so does a human; a rabbit gets caught in a trap and so does a human; a rabbit is eaten...\n\nAll in all a very interesting Ozon movie. And as always in his films, there is more behind it than one may notice at first sight..."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Malice in Lalaland&quot; has two major failures: among the worst Lewis Carroll adaptations/ripoffs ever attempted and unfortunately an incompetent attempt to resurrect 35mm format for filming porn.\n\nI watched it for an obscure reason: I collect the videos of London&apos;s Harmony Films, an interesting banner that has spotlighted the work of talents like Tanya Hyde and Gazzman. The vanity pornographer &quot;Lew Xypher&quot; has released both his productions through Harmony, the previous one a Hyde imitation called &quot;Hell Is Where the Party Is&quot;, so I bought them.\n\nHere we have an absence of ideas or proper script -merely gonzo sex scenes, the requisite kinkiness already reflected in &quot;Hell&quot;, and no knowledge of cinematic technique. The widescreen visuals try to impress, but in many scenes the lighting is poor, the focus off (read: out-of-focus) or terribly soft for no reason. Misusing 35mm cameras is hardly the solution to reversing the early retirement in porn (and in TV and most indie mainstream filmmaking), due to the ease, relative cheapness and flexibility of HD technology instead.\n\nOn to the content: Sasha Grey brings nothing, literally nothing, to the Alice = Malice role. Her super-stardom, including boosterism by Soderbergh, mystifies me - I would place her in the bottom 1 percentile of porn stars all-time, completely lacking distinction. The rest of the cast has little to do except Brit import Keni Styles as Chester Katz, hardly the Chesshire Cat one would expect to be lampooned. Styles&apos; sojourn in Lalaland after his successful Euro career as virtually the only male Oriental star in porn, is self-indulgent here, as he heads up a feature-length BTS bonus in which he gets to hump Jenna Presley (lucky guy) off-camera, but on BTS camera, if you follow my drift.\n\nIn fact, this is worse than those dreaded porn parodies which are at the bottom of the XXX barrel, but do not preclude even crummier productions sneaking in below them. I truly hated the Sunny Lane &quot;Alice&quot; parody, with its ugliness and fake-punk approach, and the animated feature from the untalented folks at Adult Source Media was embarrassing..\n\nBut coming from outside of the porn mainstream Xypher brings a naiveté often seen in folks not steeped in the clichés of XXX product. His sex scenes are very poorly shot - one apologist who wrote a favorable IMDb assessment of this lousy film (and at least it can be called a film, being shot in 35mm though printed on video) explained away the Alan Stafford/Kagney Linn Karter humping in a car but seen awkwardly through windows as due to the cramped nature of the setting. Perhaps 35mm hampers such a shoot, but no one put a gun to Xypher&apos;s empty head forcing him to stage it there and that way in the first place. The man&apos;s incompetent.\n\nMalice&apos;s non-adventures after she slides down a sort of chute to end up in a California desert wasteland are boring and pointless. No imagination or even riff on Carroll emerges. The excuse for a plot line has tiresome non-sex actor Dirty Fred pursuing her and killing off much of the cast, but he&apos;s terrible, sort of an amateur version of good old Max Headroom, not Max Hardcore, but rather Matt Frewer.\n\nRequisite appearance in a bad movie of Ron Jeremy is a total waste, running a strip club and killing off some running time, but at least not involved in old age-sex. Cryptic elements like two sets of actors (one non-sex and other for sex) cast as Todd &amp; Ted Tweed = Tweedledum/Tweedledee remain just that: arbitrary and cryptic. Use of animal heads during sex scenes is a fetish tradition also borrowed from the great Tanya Hyde and her fondness for Pig Heads in her BDSM features. The cheap costumes, like the unsatisfactory bare-chested dwarf rabbit outfit worn by mute Stephen Powers, are a turn-off. Having the evil Queen (artist formerly known as Queen of Hearts) become Andy San Dimas as Dr. Queenie, playing solitaire and humping in a morgue is a waste of Andy&apos;s considerable talent.\n\nThe who&apos;s who roster of XXX stars is wasted in general. The movie has various locations and vehicles transversing between them, but ultimately goes nowhere, ending precisely where it began, in an asylum which presumably represents the residence Xypher escaped from."

The cinematography is excellent, the set designs are very well composed and visually attractive. The most important thing is that the plot is outstanding.\n\nIt deals with many social issues. It looks at how one person jumping into conclusions can cause so much bias and distorted viewpoints. It looks at how one vocal and persuasive person can influence the crowd, creating a herd effect not dissimilar to what Hitler was able to do. It examines how people are protective of children in such a way that they would rather accuse the good than to miss one bad guy. It also looks at how gay men are robbed of their rights to adopt, or to be near children because of the mistaken idea of &quot;homosexuals have to be paedophiles&quot;.\n\nI am immensely impressed by this film. It touches me and I am sure it will touch you too."

The memory of its excellent source novel, William Sloane&apos;s &quot;The Edge of Running Water&quot; (1937), is still very much with me from several years ago, you see, and I&apos;m afraid that the film does suffer in comparison. The book has sharply drawn characters, a well-detailed plot (a scientist attempting to communicate with his dead wife), great suspense and a very satisfying windup. The film, unfortunately, has none of these things in much abundance. Still, there ARE some good things to be said for it. Boris Karloff, as usual, is wonderful, as is Anne Revere in her role as his assistant. The effects are more than passable, and, at a mere 65 minutes, there is no unnecessary padding. Indeed, the film can be accused of being not fleshed out enough! Several things aren&apos;t explained; even Boris&apos; fate is never clearly shown, unlike his character&apos;s amazing finish in the book. This is a story that is truly ripe for a remake, if done faithfully and by a team that respects the source material. Still, I can think of many more fruitless ways to spend an hour than by curling up with &quot;The Devil Commands.&quot;",

The director&apos;s approach is old-line and it leaves a mark of this movie. Positive thing what the cameramen did (as they shot the film, settings), but the soundtrack is uncritical. A few songs were sang by the actors - anyway, they are actors not singers so the whole thing is a mess from the beginning to the end. This movie shows the present state of the small hungarian cinematography. There are films like &quot;Kontroll&quot; which are so good that non-hungarian people can enjoy too, but for this..this is a tall order. I hope, hungarian people in cinemas will amuse themselves - I&apos;m not sure they will be glad.",

One thing I did notice in this film is that Karloff was not real tall. Remember those big shoes in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;? He had them for a reason. Lewton has done better but this film is enhanced by Karloff&apos;s presence and Drew&apos;s natural beauty.",

IMHO there should have been more to watch maybe another target for him to kill .. still i highly recommend the movie even if you aren&apos;t a big fan of the game. \n\nTimothy Olyphant was great in the way he performed agent 47 .. the way he walks , the way he moves or look , he literally rocked .\n\nAfter all , i wish that the 20th century would think of producing another hit-man as good as this one or maybe better .",

      "reviewBody": "This film was so hard for me to watch as my wife died from cardiomyopathy aged just 28 in 1991, we had/have 2 daughters who were 14mths and 3 yrs old when my wife died. The saddest part was that in late 1990 after my wife had been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy she watched on TV the film Beaches, (unknown to me), on her own in our bedroom and I was outside gardening at that time. I came in to see her later and I could tell she had been crying, when I asked why she had been crying she burst into tears saying she would never see our 2 girls grow up, i said &quot;don&apos;t be silly&quot; and gave her a big cuddle. At that time I thought that neither of us knew what her prognosis would be but she did because of the Beaches film but didn&apos;t tell me. A few days later she said that she had watched a film called Beaches and just said it was quite sad but gave me no details of the film. After my wife died I was devastated and life was very tough for many years, I&apos;m now 63 and our daughters are 30 and 32, both now older than their mum was when she died and its so sad that they never knew her. They are both very happy today. I met someone in 2006 and we have been living together happily since. Just by chance in about 2014 my partner was going through Netflix and the film Beaches came up, because neither of us had seen it i said lets watch it as my late wife had seen this film and had said that it was sad. I quickly realised why she had said back in 1990 why she wouldn&apos;t see our girls grow up and I did cry watching it and thought of my late wife at 27 yrs old knowing that there was no cure and she knew that she wouldn&apos;t see her girls grow up 😢😢 I know this isnt much of a review but it brought back so many sad memories and how brave my wife was for not telling me 😢. Please watch the film its worth watching",

      "reviewBody": "I came across this film from a review by Roger Ebert. I have grown to respect his opinions most of the time. It was also a big motivator to check out to see Christian Bale and John Hurt on screen together. I&apos;m a fan of both of them. The film starts out well with a good introductory to Bale&apos;s character caring for his mouse which he must keep hidden from his step father. However the second the step father appears and comes across as a James Bond villain or Darth Vader, especially with the over bearing music, I began to get concerned. Evil step father&apos;s are often poorly portrayed in films and are over the top but this one takes the cake. It was just ridiculous. Pretty much every character was over the top and felt over exaggerated. You could make a drinking game off of how many times Bale cries in this film. It just seemed the director was stereotyping mentally challenged people as crying a lot. Even John Hurt, arguably one of the best Shakespearean actors of all time, looks weak in this film. Of course it isn&apos;t the actors faults. We all know that Bale and Hurt are amazing talents. It&apos;s clearly the fault of an inexperienced director who definitely has not learned the art of subtlety. The concept was interesting and could have lead to a good story in the right hands. In these hands though the narrative is unfocused and poses to be meaningful but in the end isn&apos;t. There are plot points that come up that are out of place and have no real point in the film. Towards the end of the film, the whole thing goes off of the deep end. We go into pure fantasy with the step father turning into the equivalent of a comic book super villain. He apparently has the strength of a few men, is unfazed by injury, and can punch through glass windows. It was just so ridiculous. There are so many directions this film could have gone in and they took the worst route imaginable. I really have nothing good to say about this movie other then that Christian Bale and John Hurt did an okay job given that they clearly had nothing to work with. Though it&apos;s interesting to look at Bale&apos;s performance in this and lay it beside his eerily comedic role in American Psycho, which came out only a year later. If you look at both performances side by side you can see that Bale has an incredible range.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Man on the train&quot;, directed by Patrice Leconte is &quot;intimiste&quot; French cinema at its best. It tells the story of a chance encounter and ensuing friendship between Milan, a gangster who is coming to a small French town to rob a bank and Manesquier, a retired professor of poetry who has lived there his whole life. The two protagonists could not be more different and yet, each one becomes fascinated by the other&apos;s life. Soon, Milan tries on slippers and Manesquier is shooting a gun at soda cans. Was Milan&apos;s life wasted because he never had the strength to fill his life with the structure he so desires? Was Manesquier&apos;s life wasted because he never had the strength to escape the structured life he so loathes? Will they go all the way and actually exchange lives? The movie is extremely well directed and photographed, with grainy blueish colors that support each character&apos;s melancholy. The script is tight and leaves room for silent moments which are as important to the story as the dialogue (a concept unknown in Hollywood). Every word has a deeper meaning than its litteral one. In one of the best scenes of the movie, the elegant poetry professor Manesquier puts on Milan&apos;s leather jacket and stands in front of the mirror saying in English: &quot;The name is Earp...Wyatt Earp&quot;. But in the end, what makes the movie such a gem is the talent of the two lead actors who, like their characters, are such extreme opposites that their screen relationship could easily have ended up devoid of any chemestry. Jean Rochefort is an intellectual and one of France&apos;s greatest and most subtle living actors. Johnny Hallyday is the uneducated, over-the-top rock&apos;n roll singer and social icon who has monopolized the #1 spot in French music charts since 1960 and who has been derided by the French intelligentsia ever since. Until the movie, Rochefort himself was no fan of Hallyday, though he likes to say with a grin: &quot;Madame Rochefort, on the other hand...&quot;. They have since become friends. It, reportedly, took a lot of effort by Rochefort and Leconte to make Hallyday comfortable enough to act opposite Rochefort whom he saw as a towering icon. They most certainly succeeded since, in the end, it is the surprising subtelty of Hallyday&apos;s performance that makes the movie so poignant. Despite the botox injections and the face lifts, his Mount Rushmore face looks like that of a man who has been to hell and back a few hundred times. He has such presence and charisma that you can&apos;t take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen. Though he plays Milan with a minimalist approach, both in demeanor and delivery, he manages to display the most intense emotions in a simple grin, a gesture or a stare. The way he smokes Manesquier&apos;s pipe while explaining Balzac&apos;s &quot;Eugenie Grandet&quot; (which he has obviously never read) to a private student of Manesquier will make you chuckle. The way he looks at Manesquier when he leaves his house at the end of the movie will simply break your heart... &quot;Man on the train&quot; is a gentle, tender film which asks big questions in little ways. Let&apos;s pray it never gets remade in Hollywood..."

If you look carefully -I saw the film two times- you see the subtitle acting from carefully casted actors. Tom Conti is giving away one of his best performances since a long time. Guy Marchand is playing marvelous. Anne Charrier is the new discovery in France. And there is this Dutch actor playing Bennie, which I find terrific. Not forgetting the beautiful score of Jaques Morelenbaum, which gives together with the lighting a warm feel into this harsh story of criminals. Murilo Benicio, our Brazilian proud, makes of a harsh killer a man with a heart, which takes the movie above many other crime movies.",

Although not my favourite of Lubitsch&apos;s films it hold a place in the top five. This movie is assured to put a smile on your face the whole way through, driven by Lubitsch&apos;s at times expressive directing.",

      "reviewBody": "Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn&apos;t imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy&apos;s character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.\n\nSome of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I&apos;m sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it&apos;s hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far.",

I used to think you could never go wrong buying movies sporting a flaming hammer and sickle, but apparently my logic is flawed. It opens as our hero, an obvious reject for the HeMan live action movie, helps a russian woman and her children evade certain death by moving them five feet to the left. The movie after this point kind of degenerates.  For some reason, the military hire a chemist to track down this ne&apos;er do well, who is in America blowing stuff up with his eyes which, coincedentally, shoot lightning bolts. Apparently, he only does this on days that are prime numbers and this ability doesn&apos;t work on shoddily assembled chain link fences.  Not that he was in any real danger, the only person in this movie who could shoot straight was me, and I&apos;ll miss that TV. The most interesting part of this movie was the 15 minutes after the credits, where I stared at a blank screen expecting an apology.  If you decide to watch this movie, The Bull recommends doing it drunk, preferably on vodka, and far enough over the hill you won&apos;t remember it.",

The trailers that I&apos;d remembered seeing were pretty funny, but I&apos;d assumed that those were the best parts of Double Take.  Anyway, I watched it nonetheless and didn&apos;t think it was half bad.  There were several parts not included in the trailer that were laugh-out-loud funny.  Some might be offended by the fact that Griffen&apos;s character is (in the filmic sense) a &quot;coon.&quot;  Although nowhere near as good a comedy as Blazing Saddles, it is comparable in certain aspects.  Double Take could be considered racist, but like Blazing Saddles, it uses racial stereotypes to emphasize the stupidity of their existence. Here, instead of black vs. white, we see upper-class African-Americans ashamed of the Sambo stereotype, and thus not associating with other African-Americans with lower social status.  I&apos;m not sure if this message was intentional in Double Take, but it was there nonetheless.  Orlando Jones had a pretty good performance and Griffen was a convincing character (some might say he was over-the-top, but again I&apos;d say this was essential).  One problem was that the movie quite suddenly switched gears from a comedy to a somewhat serious action/suspense flick.  I felt the heavy emphasis upon the latter took away from its comic moral message and made the movie shallower. So, it had potential.  They could have recruited a few more writers to add in funnier jokes.  All in all, a 6 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Privileged Valley girls discover that they are not immune to the consequences of their bad decisions.\n\nI was not impressed by this movie on my first viewing, more than forty years ago, but a chance to see it on Turner Classic Movies after I had forgotten everything about it revealed a better movie and a more mature understanding of what the film makers were trying to say. The young women, led by Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie, don&apos;t understand the costs of what they are doing, between the drinking, the sex, and the hard partying that leaves the parents angry at the sheer destruction. Like the contemporaneous LITTLE DARLINGS, it failed because it didn&apos;t really understand who its audience was, and what they would enjoy seeing. The older segment of the audience was angry at the young women, and the younger portions didn&apos;t care for the unhappy ending with its inherent moralizing.\n\nHaving grown up with the East Coast bracket of privileged young people, I can say the attitudes were precisely on point. With Scott Baio, Sally Kellerman, Randy Quaid, and Laura Dern.",

The Jargon was a trade language made up of English, French and Indian. It was primarily used on the west coast and as far east as Montana as a common language for trading etc. When I was a little boy my granddad and I used to talk back and forth in Chinook. What we hear in the movie is quite accurate, although they speak too fast for me to keep up with. Needless to say, that with the passage of time, the language has all but disappeared from everyday use. There are, however, people dedicated to keeping it alive and they sometimes have a yearly &quot;rendezvous&quot; where it is spoken and lessons are taught.\n\nThank you very one for your time. Klahowya Sikhs. (Goodbye friends)."

When they first arrive on the &quot;dark side&quot; of the moon, the amount of detail is astounding. From architecture and buildings to vehicles and clothes and aliens... it&apos;s like a dream brought to life, and it&apos;s an overload in all the best ways.\n\nEvery shot offers something new. If this had a better story - better thought out and a bit more maturity, like a Pixar film or a Miyazaki film - this really could have been a classic for the ages. Along with Tekkonkinkreet, I put this as the best anime I&apos;ve seen as far as world-building and showing me places I wish I could walk around.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; is a highly romanticized picture of &apos;Buffalo&apos; Bill Cody. While IMDb is correct that most of the things in this biopic are actually based on Cody&apos;s real-life exploits, most of the relationship between him and his wife was pure hooey. Sadly, there was no great love in Cody&apos;s life--or if there was, it wasn&apos;t his wife! Most of their life was spent apart by his choice--and there were other women in his life. But, this image of Bill would not have gotten past censors back in 1944, so the studio fictionalized this aspect of his life. The rest, however, is reasonably accurate--something that surprised me as I watched the film. He was a scout for the US Army in the west, he fought in the Indian wars and he did start up an incredibly successful Wild West Show.\n\nAnother aspect of the film that struck me was its treatment of the American Indians--particularly the Cheyenne. It was odd, as the major roles of the &apos;Indians&apos; were played by Linda Darnell and Anthony Quinn!!! This insensitivity was pretty much the way American Indians were portrayed in American films through the 1950s. HOWEVER, despite this insensitivity, the film did correctly assert that the Indian wars were forced on these people due to how they were treated by the government. And, in this way, the film was much more balanced than many westerns of the day.\n\nOverall, a somewhat inaccurate film that looked nice and featured the excellent acting, as usual, by Joel McCrea. Worth seeing--just not exactly the Gospel! And, the final line of the film might make you throw up--so when that little kid in the audience stands up, PLUG YOUR EARS!!! \n\nBy the way, the film made one HUGE mistake. General Sherman NEVER said &quot;The only good Indian is a dead Indian&quot;. This quote was actually from General Sheridan--though it&apos;s not exactly what he said. When he was asked what a good Indian was like, he said very succinctly &quot;...a dead one&quot;.",

I was very pleasantly surprised that it was almost sympathetic to both sides. There is no narration whatsoever, which allows the viewer to listen to both viewpoints only through the voices of the advocates on each side. I have always struggled with the issue of abortion personally, and I think this film does a great job of showing that there is a very real human element on both ends of the debate... No matter what the previous reviewers say. And by the way, I don&apos;t see any problem with a woman hearing both options before ending a pregnancy... There&apos;s no changing your mind after abortion, so I believe that taking a moment to hear alternatives is not wasted time. Very well done film making",

You always know whats happening, you are the one that knows just everything, that won&apos;t mean the story is predictable but there&apos;s just no room for guessing (like in other movies, &quot;f.i. who&apos;s the murder ?&quot;). Anway it&apos;s a very cool movie, if I had to compare it it&apos;s like a thrilling story your grandpa tells you. You&apos;re eager to know what&apos;s happening next but once you heard it you don&apos;t want to hear it again.\n\nGood and maybe Great but not Excellent.",

Unfortunately, being only two foot four inches tall, Nelson&apos;s &apos;all&apos; is nowhere near enough, and with weak support from genre regulars Janet Agren and David Warbeck, who practically sleepwalk though their roles, Ratman winds up being extremely disappointing.\n\nBetween dreadfully dull scenes of chinwagging between Agren and Warbeck, as they attempt to discover who or what is responsible for a spate of recent murders, viewers are treated to a touch of light gore, plus some nudity courtesy of Agren&apos;s busty fashion model sister (who displays very unusual techniques when it comes to both modelling and taking a shower). There&apos;s also a little fun to be had from seeing just where teensy Nelson will pop out next: during the film, he launches attacks from a wardrobe, a fridge, a box, a luggage bag, and a toilet.\n\nAll of this cheesy silliness, however, is not nearly enough to compensate for the movie&apos;s virtually plot less script, crap acting and torpid direction.",

Created to win a Nobel prize; the only awards he&apos;ll be picking up will be for slaying showering beauty Eva Grimaldi but not before she&apos;s soaped up for your pleasure! Janet Agren plays her sister out to discover what has happened to Eva and who or what is devouring the residents of a lush Caribbean island.\r\n\r\nA glorious exploitation fest of bad taste, worse acting, needless nudity and tense wince-inducing slaughter, please welcome and give the loveable Ratman a home in your horror collection today.\r\n\r\nEditors should note that the rarity of Ratman worldwide is partly die to the extreme rarity of materials to work with. Shameless have spent months assembling the film from a variety of sources and variable quality should be expected. For a film of this type the grungy presentation only adds to the joy!\r\n\r\nRatman (feature film is cert. 15) is released uncut (for the first time in the UK) on DVD by Shameless Screen Entertainment.

Forget the science that supplies the basic premise for the film, it is all hokey (though the book Landry is reading when we first meet her is a currently important text), but if you go along with the impossible premise of the story, it raises some questions that my wife and I enjoyed talking about. I wondered if some of the guys in our society would understand that this film is about them, but they don&apos;t get it, just as Landry - thinking like a man - does not get it. The film is full of stereotypes, but they are all fairly enjoyable, and together they make something that is greater than the sum of the parts. But above all - it is Landry who shines as she plays two different roles to the hilt.",

      "name": "cowboy (Guy Madison) realizes his cattle disappear because a dinosaur eats them",
      "reviewBody": "When it came to dinosaur special effects in the 1950s, absolutely no one came close to Ray Harryhausen, and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms still reigns as the classic of that time. Others who dared try and compete were lucky to come in a distant second, but that didn&apos;t mean there wasn&apos;t a fun quality to their films. The Beast From Hollow Mountain is one of those minor league yet highly enjoyable attempts to combine the two favorite elements of 12 to 15 year old boys when we went to the movies back in the mid-fifties: cowboys and dinosaurs. We knew Guy Madison well from his long run Wild Bill Hickock TV series, which had precious little to do with the real life of that historic character but was plenty of fun all the same. Here, he&apos;s a range rider who discovers that his cattle are disappearing. Could it be outlaws? No, the title creature, who attacks Madison, a cute little Mexican kid, the gorgeous Patricia Medina, and a whole host of vaqueros. There is (as was the case back then) precious little dinosaur footage, for the way they kept costs down back then was to &apos;tease&apos; you with distant growls, but avoid showing you the real thing for as long as possible. After about an hour of this, you got maybe fifteen minutes of actual footage with the creature (who has the weirdest, wildest tongue of any dinosaur in movie history) chasing after Guy and friends with the swiftness of a professional track star. And it&apos;s a good thing they keep him offscreen, because he&apos;s at best semi-convincing when you do see him. That doesn&apos;t make this brightly colored film and less fun to watch. And the way in which Madison gets the thing at the end is a real lulu.",

I got really tired of Signora Norris&apos;s spot lit face beaming out of the center of the frame. The settings are detailed and some of the exteriors in snow, mist and rain are effective but the performances are cardboard.\n\nFor the curious, there is some striking imagery and the quality of the Cristaldi DVD (with Italian sub-titles) is exceptional."

      "name": "The beginning of the Basil Rathbone &apos;Holmes&apos; series",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, arguably the most famous of all of Sherlock Holmes&apos; cases, was filmed in 1939 - not for the first time, of course (there had already been at least five tries, most notably in 1932 with Robert Rendel), but probably in the most impressive way possible. And it was the first time that Basil Rathbone portrayed the world-famous sleuth from Baker Street - the beginning of a very successful, and very high-class film serial produced by 20th Century-Fox that would comprise all in all 15 movies over the next eight years.\n\nAnd Rathbone certainly was an ideal choice for the role, both physically and regarding his (on-screen) image: very British, and slightly haughty, but still with a sense of humor - only most of the time at the expense of his friend and assistant, amiable Dr. Watson, who was wonderfully played by Nigel Bruce. In fact, many Sherlock Holmes fans regard Rathbone as THE personification of Holmes (only we mustn&apos;t forget Arthur Wontner, who had also played Holmes in five movies, and was at LEAST as close to Conan Doyle&apos;s original character, if not even a little bit more...).\n\nActually, the whole cast is superb: idyllically handsome young Richard Greene as Sir Henry Baskerville, the heir of the huge estate of the Baskervilles, whose father has died under mysterious circumstances in the moor recently, Lionel Atwill as the strange Dr. Mortimer, Wendy Barrie as beautiful Beryl, Morton Lowry as her young step-brother... And no less superb is the direction: foggy Dartmoor probably had never been photographed in such a uniquely creepy way before, providing a perfect background for the murderous ongoings that revolve around the old legend of a horrible hound that scares or bites people to death... But Sherlock Holmes, of course, has got another, much more reasonable theory! \n\nThe whole film is immensely suspenseful (with England around 1900 being marvelously recreated in every detail), but especially the dramatic climax in the end is REALLY made for strong nerves - a real, thrilling, classic MUST for every fan of the crime genre!",

      "name": "Fighting Against a Vampire and a Ghost",
      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with a young man by the name of &quot;Yasith&quot; and his pregnant girlfriend &quot;Maya&quot; attending a concert on the outskirts of a village in the Battambang province of Cambodia and upon walking home together they are attacked by a group of thugs alongside a path in the forest. Although Yasith fights back, he is eventually stabbed and killed while Maya is gang-raped and left in an unconscious state. As it so happens, however, a seriously wounded female vampire just happens to be in a tree overlooking the incident and dribbles some saliva into Maya&apos;s mouth which has the effect of turning her into a vampire as well. The scene then shifts to 16 years later with a group of students traveling from Phnom Penh on a field trip to Batambang to study the area and the local temples located there. Naturally, needing a place to stay they settle upon a large house which, as luck would have it, is owned by Maya who is quite cordial at first. That changes, unfortunately, when she feels disrespected by a comment from one of these students and--along with the ghost of her vampire predecessor--decides to kill all of them. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film relies heavily upon Southeast Asian folklore and as a result some of it seemed quite strange to me. For example, the vampire tradition is quite different there than the Western version in that in Cambodia the vampire (or &quot;Krasue&quot; as it is known in Thailand) has its head detached from its mortal body and floats in the air at night with its entrails fastened beneath it as it feeds upon the blood of its victims. To complicate matters, the English subtitles weren&apos;t that good and--although I managed to understand what was going on for the most part--I may have missed some of the context in translation. Likewise, while I normally try to link the actor&apos;s name to their respective character, I found it impossible to do so even though I searched all of the movie websites known to me. As far as the technical merits of the film are concerned, I think I should start out by saying the Cambodian film industry is still in its infancy and like so many other facets of this society it suffered greatly under the atrocities of the Pol Pot regime. No question about it and for that reason alone this film deserves some credit for its success nationally. That being said, however, some of the faults were simply too obvious to be ignored with the graphics easily standing out the most. Throw in some bad acting, inept humor and one-dimensional characters and its hard for me to rate this film any higher than I have. Below average.",

      "name": "&quot;HOT TRIANGLE&quot; doesn&apos;t begin to describe this......",
      "reviewBody": ".....strangely philosophical and sometimes wondrous take on the Lives &amp; Loves of men and women in today&apos;s world. BUT, hold on a sec...hasn&apos;t the behavior being shown to us likely EVER been so....even in humankind&apos;s earliest days, in the dark protectiveness of caves? ....Well, whether that is the case or not--right now--today, a most perceptive Director of Film (Tom Tykwer) is giving us a stripped bare view into the lives of 2 Men and 1 Woman....the &quot;3&quot; making up this proverbial TRIANGLE. So, Dear Viewer, you need only sit back...relax...then watch and see: ....Their discovery, first, of love with one another---then, finally, their reaching a loving-union of the &quot;3&quot;.\n\nI cannot tell you that the Male-Female Hook-up (can we call it &quot;illicit&quot;) being shown us is any differently played out than in 100s of movie stories which have come before. BUT...on the other hand, and strikingly so...it is in the Male / Male &quot;Connection&quot; where you will find the Difference in this film. For in a mainstream production such as this, rarely will you ever see shown Physically Realistic (and Tender) lovemaking between 2 men....presented in such a forthright manner. Devid Striesow (&quot;Adam&quot;) and Sebastian Schipper (&quot;Simon&quot;) absolutely &quot;ZING&quot; in their scenes together. The word, Hot, does not describe it; though if written as HOT, perhaps it begins to do so. (WORD OF ADVICE: Director Tykwer&apos;s use of &quot;split screen&quot; techniques throughout, sometimes showing 4 to 6 activities occurring in one scene/shot, makes some of the &quot;HOT actions&quot; a bit difficult to follow and fully enjoy. Better you watch on video....rather than in the theater.)\n\nAs to this movie&apos;s performers and their abilities, these &quot;3&quot; actors are highly competent and experienced (extensive film histories)....though perhaps not at the level of paparazzi-pursued, top tier German celebs. YET, what they truly give to us is BELIEVABILITY....bringing viewers to the point of SUDDENLY realizing their characters&apos; origin: ....Perhaps from Earth&apos;s First Garden---but here, in our world today, we are being given a &quot;Hanna&quot;....a &quot;Simon&quot;....and, most especially, &quot;The Enticer&quot;. So, this Enticer; what can be said about him? Well, maybe just this, Reader Mine: ....When your self-image is at its lowest...and your need to be desired is at its highest.....just stop and look around you. HE&apos;s out there, close by....waiting, waiting to enfold you in Tenderness and Excitement. Waiting to make the rest of your life its Happiest.\n\nI&apos;ll say Goodbye to you now...upon leaving this Garden of &quot;3&quot;. And concede that this story may contain instances of over-dramatized familial and midlife crises---not to mention startling images of a male medical procedure. Nevertheless, this is a work which I will be re-watching on a somewhat regular basis---concentrating on the Male / Male action, of course. (Uh..oh).\n\nPS: For those interested, see the excellent Devid Striesow in the very good and &quot;gay-tinged&quot; 2004 film production: &quot;BEFORE THE FALL&quot;. That is, IF you can find it available as a rental; used DVD copies are going for a high price. Oh, and for something very &quot;different&quot;...but very well done (in a &quot;straight&quot; love story mode), try Tykwer&apos;s 2002 &quot;HEAVEN&quot; (Cate Blanchett). You, likely, will not be sorry.\n\n****"

The templar&apos;s horses&apos; r missing n the film moves at a very slow pace, more slower than the zombies.

The movies two best qualities are the scene in the caves where the hero and heroiness are running from the aliens and that the total running time is somewhere around 45 minutes. In the caves the most incredible actor, the fuzzy rat, bears its fangs priceless. But if you have anything else to do, like laundry, mowing the yard or even taking out the trash your time would probably be better spent else ware. This is time you will never get back."

Although I am not a fan of Chinese humor because of its reliance on slapstick and hyperbole, it is filmed with a visual richness that Yimou has made his signature.\n\nOlder husband abuses younger wife, who is being adulterous with a handsome, cowardly servant. Her purchasing a gun sets in motion a series of revenge activities that flesh out the Coen&apos;s title.\n\nThe magnified close-ups and slow motion sequences accompanied by dazzling colors make a satisfying visual experience if the humor is just not that humorous."

      "reviewBody": "Most people probably have vaguely heard of William Wilberforce without knowing too much about his life. The power of his story, and the power of the central issue (the abolition of slavery), carries this movie that veers from artful to clumsy.\n\nThe movie can be confusing, as it moves back and forth between phases of Wilberforce&apos;s life. Often I found myself wondering for a few moments, &quot;When is this?&quot; Also, much of the political intrigue has to be inferred, since the backgrounds of the various players - particularly Wilberforce&apos;s adversaries - are not adequately explained.\n\nHowever, the performances are quite good, some bordering on excellence. Some might argue that the villains are too simplistically presented, but on an issue like slavery, it is expected that the opposition would be completely unsympathetic (just as Nazis are rarely presented with any hint of sympathy).\n\nI am sure the writers took some liberties with history. By the way, the tune we now associate with the hymn &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; did not become the melody for John Newton&apos;s famous lyrics until after Wilberforce&apos;s death.\n\nI just watched this movie at a private screening for attendees of the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC (clergy are a natural audience for this movie). The reception was favorable, but this was an audience for which the moralizing of the story would naturally resonate. I&apos;m not sure it will attract a very broad audience - this is a movie that may well find its niche on DVD being shown in high school history classes and at church gatherings.\n\nIt is a nice, historical, period piece. It is (largely due to subject matter) reminiscent of &quot;Amistad&quot;, with similar pacing.\n\nShould you see it? It depends on whether you like this TYPE of movie. If this genre (historical drama) interests you, this is quite well-done. It might even inspire you to read more about Wilberforce. Go see it. If you are in search of movies that teach lessons about good values and perseverance in fighting for what&apos;s right, go see it.\n\nBut if you have no idea when the French Revolution occurred relative to our War of Independence, and if it doesn&apos;t come naturally to you to remember that the newborn U.S. was allied with France against Britain during that period - and if you don&apos;t care - this movie might not be your idea of a fun time.\n\nIf I were the producers, I would add one of those &quot;scrolling text&quot; historical introductions to the film before final release, though it is probably too late.",

      "reviewBody": "Recently revisited the classic The Survivors (1983) on Tubi. The storyline revolves around two individuals who, by a stroke of fate, become friends after losing their jobs simultaneously and accidentally thwarting a hitman&apos;s plan. Following these events, the younger friend decides to retreat from society and join an extreme survivalist group in the mountains, while the older friend contemplates how to bounce back financially. However, when the vengeful hitman returns, the two friends must reunite and work together once more.\n\nDirected by Michael Ritchie (The Golden Child), the film features an exceptional cast, including Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men), Robin Williams (Mrs. Doubtfire), Jerry Reed (Smokey and the Bandit) and James Wainwright (Beyond Westworld).\n\nWalter Matthau and Robin Williams absolutely nailed their respective roles. Their facial expressions, mannerisms, and delivery of dialogue were flawless from start to finish. Robin Williams brought a wild, unpredictable, and utterly engaging quality to his character, making it impossible not to embrace his random and awkward persona. Matthau&apos;s reactions to Williams were consistently hilarious, and their on-screen chemistry was spot-on. Jerry Reed played a memorable villain, and the film&apos;s circumstances were uniquely entertaining within the comedy genre.\n\nIn conclusion, The Survivors is a distinctive and well-executed addition to the comedy genre. I would rate this a 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",

After it pulls away, two people are revealed. A young man sitting by the door with his face to the ground, and an older man who is walking towards him. Even though we can&apos;t see his face, we know he is old, just by the way he moves. He asks the young man if he would like some coffee and cigarettes. And this is how Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s first film begins.\n\n&quot;Hard Eight&quot; is about a down and out loser named John (John C. Reilly), who sits outside a diner, until he is encountered by a mysterious old man named Sydney (Philip Baker Hall). Sydney offers him $50, and a lesson in gambling. Before to long, they are in Reno, making lots of money. Then two people get in the way of their friendship: Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow), a hooker/waitress; and Jimmy (Samuel L. Jackson), a mischievous security guard who seems to be hiding something. \n\nI never thought that Paul Thomas Anderson could make such a grounded film with substance. His usual films are flashy ensembles, and they move fast. But &quot;Hard Eight&quot; is a different story. It is a slow paced Film Noir, that is both quiet and observant. The cinematography is drab, and the direction is tranquil. Philip Baker Hall and Paltrow turn in good performances. But it is Jackson who really shines. The twist could have been over done, but instead, it is handled nicely and effectively. \n\n&quot;Hard Eight&quot; is by far one of the most interesting character studies of the 90&apos;s. I like this cool side of Anderson, and I wish he would use it more often than his usual over the top formula (although I like both). This is no classic, but I found it worth buying.\n\n-30-"

There are quite a few clashes, a love story, and betrayal all wrapped up in a disturbing package.\n\nWhile watching Romper Stomper I found myself sympathizing with at least one of the racist characters, even though my views are far from his -- it&apos;s just that well written and acted. \n\nThere aren&apos;t a lot of surprise in this film, but the surprises that exist are truly interesting and plausible. This does not mean that the movie is cliche and boring, though -- it presents its ideas in an interesting fashion with well-written and directed acting.",

Driving as fast 100mph in Paris (no special FX) without advising the Paris City Hall of his mad project, Claude Lelouch (who drives the car) runs 10-12km in the city in 7 minutes...\n\nThe movie has been shot using a camera installe on the front bumpers of a Mercedes 300SEL 6.9 because of the quality of the pneumatic shock absorbers (to avoid image vibrations).\n\nFurther, the soundtrack (engine noise) has been recorded doing the run AGAIN on a Ferrari 308GTB.\n\nThis guy is crazy!\n\n(Source: Claude Lelouch himself during an interview on Paris Premiere French cable TV channel)"

I liked watching him so much that I have a crush on him now. It was sad that Dorothy did not realize that true love was underneath her all those years by her agent, Earl Mills. He helped her and truly loved her. I don&apos;t know if he was gay or just too obvious. Halle Berry really struts her acting abilities in this role. She makes us understand Dorothy&apos;s painful life. The violation by her own family to see if she was still a virgin after dating the Nicholas brothers. She was more than just an actress, she was truly an entertainer who deserved more. She puts a feet in the swimming pool and the hotel drains it because of her race. It was kind of hard not to be saddened by the racism of the past and what Dorothy did to endure.",

      "reviewBody": "This rating and review is strictly based on the movie and its representation of the original plot, and not based on the the original story.\n\nThe characters physical portrayal vs. anime: The main characters looked very much like the original. This was probably the best part of the movie.\n\nThe characters and acting: the acting was awful, particularly the actor for Hatchiko (Nana Komatsu). The actor tried to remain true to the anime character and one could see she was trying very hard. However she lacked sincere emotion. The true manifestation of the loneliness and state of desperation was a fail in coming across to me as a viewer. I was not convinced that Hatchiko was lonely. Just pretending to be a happy go lucky girl, and even so it seemed forced, but not because she was lonely but rather she just wasn&apos;t used to showing her emotions.\n\nThe plot representation. The very basic storyline was well represented but it completely left out the message of youth, the recklessness of youth and the impact of fear of abandonment and loneliness during youth.\n\nScore and music: this could have made the movie. As it stands because of its absence, it broke the movie. The anime used music to transfer the emotion to the viewers. The movie could do something similar. Music is fundamental to the storyline and its a shame that it wasn&apos;t used to the fullest advantage, to connect with the viewers. The movie became cringe worthy because there were intense scenes that were so quiet i just kept fast forwarding because it just wasnt doing the scene justice.",

      "reviewBody": "On the first day of the romantic honeymoon at the beach, a random zombie that comes stumbling out of the ocean infects Danny with an incurable virus. After being dead for a full ten minutes, he miraculously awakes and even continues planning his emigration to Portugal with his beloved bride Denise. But Danny really isn&apos;t the same anymore, as his insatiable hunger for human flesh drives him to forcefully attack people while Denise  loving wife as she is  helps him get rid of the leftover corpses. For only his second film as a writer slash director, Dave Gebroe had the bizarre ambition to blend gross horror with genuine romantic drama and even to throw in bits of comedy. The idea is admirable but, as you can imagine, the result is an often lacking and pathetic film. You can&apos;t really expect a story to emotionally affect you while you&apos;re watching at a slowly rotting zombie that takes large bites of flesh out of people, right? Luckily for me, I saw this film at a national festival where Gebroe himself came to enlighten the audience about his motivations and influences to make it. Believe it or not, but that actually helped me appreciating the effort slightly more! The whole dramatic aspect of the story is apparently based on a real event, as the director&apos;s brother-in-law tragically died in a surfing accident, which left his young wife behind with an emotional trauma. Re-working bits and pieces of this real-life drama into a horror film served as some sort of therapy for Gebroe, who was really fond of his brother-in-law as well. However, even with bearing Gebroe&apos;s introduction in mind, &quot;Zombie Honeymoon&quot; can&apos;t possibly pass for a good film. The sentimental moments are painfully tedious whereas the zombie action is quite gore and explicit. These sudden changes in tone are difficult to process and especially the tongue-in-cheek gags entirely miss their effect. The make-up effects are rather convincing considering the fairly low budget and the acting performances are spirited. The music selection and exterior filming locations; both a homage to the deceased Danny as well, are winning elements too.",

      "reviewBody": "Overall, the Obama Deception is a very good documentary. Now at this point I will freeze, and point the following out. Whenever Alex Jones is involved you will always get two types of people watching, more-often-than-not. Firstly there are the die-hard Alex Jones fans: most things AJ says is right, his got a great mind to dissect the New World Order and all of that. Secondly are the Alex Jones haters. The type of &quot;this man is a nut-case, and boy - he makes a great case for banning guns and conspiracy theories!&quot; Personally I put myself into neither category, I like Alex Jones, I think he can do some very good journalism, his independent and will call both sides of the political isle out, and that is exactly what he does in this film. For 2008/9, there was one of the biggest political crazes in history - Yes! The cult of Obama. What this film does very well is the deconstruction of that false hope and promise very convincingly, and outlines the sheer danger in this phenomenon. The film introduces the facts about Barack Obama and George W. Bush, the Democrats and Republicans. They both work for the same people. And the next natural question for the curious, not the Obamanoid liberals (who probably despise this film) is who are these people? Well this is where one naturally becomes speculative. Obama or Bush are never going to say &quot;well, due to campaign finance and the way our political system functions of legalized bribery, we&apos;re controlled by the International Banking Cartels (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Chase) and the Military-Industrial Complex (Boeing, BAE Systems et al).&quot; That simply doesn&apos;t happen. However to all of the films skeptics I will ask this. 1) To take a recent example, why over the so-called &quot;Fiscal-Cliff&quot; deal, did Obama sign away 84% of the revenue he could have gained, had he allowed the Bush Tax Cuts to expire across the board? NASCAR loopholes? Reduction in Estate Tax, only applicable to the Rich, permanently? Reduction in Capital Gains Tax/ forms of income for hedgerow managers down to 20%, whilst the average American pays 35% tax. 2) Why is Police State legislation still in place - provisions of the PATRIOT Act, the National Defence Authorization Act, H.R. 645, establishing FEMA Camps? 3)What criminals have been taken to court from Wall Street, and why is Obama&apos;s cabinet and administration full of people from Wall Street? (as the film points out, Government of Wall Street, for the people of Wall Street&quot;)\n\nIn all, a great film asking the fundamental basic questions about the very nature of the Obama administration, and no one except the biggest pro-Wall Street/ Multinational Corporation robot or Obamanoid will come away in disillusionment. Well worth the watch!",

It&apos;s in my favorite genre, film noir, and it ranks among my favorites in that genre along with Out of the Past and Double Indemnity to name a few. Although there are a series of coincidences in the plot that stretch credibility, I believe they were necessary to maintain the pathos. In his first star turn, Burt Lancaster was excellent as the naive hood and Edmond O&apos;Brien is likewise in his portrayal of the insurance investigator. He is almost always in a supporting role but that in no way diminishes his talent. But this movie is really Ava Gardner&apos;s. She never again had a role that fully realized her talents as much as Kitty Collins. Her portrayal of the manipulative and seductive but not altogether unsympathetic mistress is one the greatest of its kind. The last scene with her and Colfax shows this type of character in its most ignominous glory. Highest recommendation, 9/10.",

An absolutely stupid choice of lead actor combined with a really bad script makes the whole thing kind of &quot;Killer Tomatoes&quot; cool.\n\nThis kind of thing happens in the story: They go into some underground tunnels beneath a graveyard with no plan, no guns, no secret charm, just Don Knotts and Mr. French going to see if the monster that killed 4 people last night is still there. They find this crazed demon-infested girl and reach near it&apos;s hugely-fanged face to pull out a hair to study. Just one dumb idea after another.\n\nMy favorite part? Check out the sound it makes when the deputies are shooting the lock at the end.\n\nI didn&apos;t see the first movie, but I don&apos;t think I needed it to review this.",

It wasn&apos;t the biggest problem though with this movie, it simply underachieved all my expectations. The whole movie is so silly and dumb, it&apos;s just not worth watching. It was supposed to be humorous, but most of the &quot;funny elements&quot; are based on racial prejudices and cultural simplifications. Even a Leslie Nielsen movie can be considered subtle to this. Besides the racial based &quot;humor&quot; even the plot is primitive. I don&apos;t want to give any details of the story line, it&apos;s just simply not worth it. The only remarkable element of the movie was the description of the UN peace-keepers who are portrayed as stupid, careless and corrupt people, which fact was recently reflected in a book written by former UN employees. \n\nThe movie was good for one thing: now I know I have to avoid movies directed by David Lister.\n\nTo sum it up I would just tell you: DON&apos;T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!",

A character, Howie mentions how he would like to see gay men being represented as something other than the woman&apos;s best friend, the hustler, the aids victim or the sex addict and this film does tend to try hard to avoid these stereotypes. The script is brilliantly written and sparkles when it is at its peak. At its worst, it may be a little bit cliche ridden but hey..it also has originality ( I have taken &quot;Meanwhile&quot; and now its commonplace down ere!) and is not afraid to portray gay men as just a group of lads who are falling in and out of relationships, liek any other group of young men. However certain characters do tend to bring the pace down a little and it does sometimes seem to have the sentiment that gay men have got it so bad compared to everyone else in the world. Timothy Olyphant stands out here in an able cast, made up primarily of TV actors. My only grumble was the inclusion of the lesbian couple who seemed to only be there to represent the ladies and also to give Howie a meatier role. 4/5",

It it still sticks with me and I think of it often. It was certainly a memorable film for a little girl. To me, it was a sweet picture of heaven and of home. It also reminded me very much of the close bond I had with my little brother. Every time I see a bluebird, I remember the movie. It made (and still makes) spotting a bluebird a wonderful experience. I hope it will come out on DVD soon so more people can see it and appreciate it. It&apos;s similar to the Wizard of Oz. It is a fantasy and a sentimental family film.",

      "reviewBody": "If this spectacular epic were rated solely on importance of the story, high production quality, including direction, sets, locations, costumes, and cinematography, then who knows, America&apos;s Stanley Kramer may have been compared to England&apos;s David Lean. And that&apos;s the only reason this movie deserves one star above mediocre. Sadly, it is the absolute worst casting for a big-budget, cast of thousands production that keeps it from being taken as seriously and as enjoyably as it should. Sinatra as a Spaniard is just plain pathetic, as he imitates (poorly) a Mexican accent, and he seems very disengaged from beautiful Sophia Loren, with whom he is supposed to be in love. Then there&apos;s the addition of the much older Cary Grant playing an English officer who becomes enamored of Sophia, and thereby a rival of Sinatra&apos;s, as Grant is more wooden and uncharming than any other of his many movie roles that you might think of. Oh, if only Sophia could save the casting mistakes, and she really tries, but with two male leads who each lack credibility and screen watchability in their own rights, Sophia can&apos;t save the characters so miscast and poorly portrayed. Theodore Bikel appears, in somewhat lesser but important role as a French general, but it is terribly difficult to distinguish specifically what accent he is using (or trying to use). So, best advice is to watch the movie uncritically with regard to the main cast, and enjoy the drama and magnificent production! Would I watch it again? Sadly, no.",

      "reviewBody": "This exciting story is set in 1922, Turkish War of Independence, in revolutionary days during fall of the Ottoman Empire . The War resulted the defeat of Greece in Western Turkey (Greco-Turkish war), on the East, Armenian state and Britain, France and Georgia. It begins at the Aegean sea when a shipwrecked of a boat called Achiles is rescued . Then two former US soldiers (Tony Curtis, Charles Bronson) along with a band (Leo Gordon who also wrote the script, Horst Janson, Tony Bonner, among others) and wielding several Thomson machine-guns join forces a group of Turkish revolutionaries. They are contacted by Osman Bey (Gregoire Aslan), to escort his daughters accompanied by a gorgeous servant (Michelle Mercier). They&apos;re commanded by the colonel Elch (Hakan), while some rebels pursue them and attack the train. The film is set in 1922 , following the defeat of Ottoman Empire that led Mustafa Kemal, Attaturk (role well played by Patrick McGee), he commanded the Turkish national movement in the war of independence. His successful military campaigns led to liberation of the country and to the establishing of Turkey. He transformed the former Ottoman Empire into a democratic, modern, secular nation-state , his reforms are referred as Kemalism. Ankara became the new capital and Kemal abolished the Caliphate and Sultanate. Later on, the treaty of Lausana ,signed July 24, 1923, established most of the modern boundaries of the country and also led to the international recognition of the new Republic as the successor state of the defunct Ottoman Empire under government of Attaturk.\n\nThe picture is packed with adventures, shootouts,noisy action, tongue in cheek , well developed characters, and wonderful outdoors from Turkey. This is an old-fashioned and grand adventure about some mercenaries who travel from a port until Smyrna in order to rob a loot. Splendid characterization from Tony Curtis as joker,sympathetic adventurer and Charles Bronson as tough,two-fisted mercenary. The producers wish to thank the government and people of Turkey without whose help and co-operation this motion picture could not have been made. The entire filming of this production took place in Turkey with the interior of the Osman Bay palace photographed at Said Halim Pasha Manor.\n\nThis moving film is well directed by Peter Collinson. Collinson&apos;s royal directorial treatment provides it with action, gun-play, humor and majestic sweep. He was an expert on thriller (Sell out, Target on assassin), suspense (Spiral staircase, Ten little Indians, Open season), terror(Straight on till morning), Warlike-adventure(You can&apos;t win ém all), his biggest hit was ¨The Italian job¨ , until his early death by cancer at 41.",

The crazy and passionate way of dealing with things was just an extension from the famine public that was not afraid of laugh of their own neurosis. \n\nThe story is not really amazing but the way they tell it is very funny. It starts slowly but after a 10 minutes you is completely involved with the characters. \n\nAlamo Facó, The Ex-boyfriend&apos;s friend is one of the funniest guys i ever saw, everybody was talking about him after the screening.",

I&apos;m not sure if it was the cast itself or the acting... maybe it was the set or costuming? The story wasn&apos;t too bad but it was lacking a bit for me.\n\nI will say it&apos;s not a horrible film - just not the A+ I was hoping for.

Sunny Deol is completely unparallel and no other actor can play the role of Tara Singh except sunny.This movie is meant for Sunny and he proves it why he is called Action King of Bolywood.But other than action Gadar has solid plot of India-Pakistan Partition tale and a love story. Brilliant work by rest of the starcast too including Ameesha patel,Vivek Shauq,Lillete Dubey and above all Amrish Puri. And what to say about the massive craze of this movie outside cinema halls all over the India when it was released on 15th june 2001.No dabang or 3 idiots can come even near the shadow of Gadar&apos;s poularity.I still remember when i watched movie ,it was a housefull show in PARAS cinema,Kurukshetra even on the 50th day after the release and audience reaction whenever Sunny Deol uttered any dialogue,Absolutely matchless. Gadar is a landmark fim in the history of Indian cinema in terms of gross collection when adjusted to inflation. Yes It is superior to 3 idiots,ETT, Dabang etc.Its has footfalls of more than 4 crores, which is a record till date.",

The story about the surprising promotion of an adman - due to the fact that he can only mumble after having lost some teeth - is really foolish and does not reflect in any way the reality of the country. It is not very funny to see Mueller-Stahl footling around. Even as a parable on the PR business, the movie does not really suit. Wouldn&apos;t it provide a couple of good laughs - for example regarding the GDR airline &quot;DDAir&quot; - the whole opus would have to be considered an annoyance. All in all: Save your time and don&apos;t watch this film.",

In the film, the camera is set up on the bridge as we see traffic going across. Yes, that&apos;s all that happens here for about thirty-seconds but this is just the type of film that was being made back in the day. I find movies like this interesting to watch today because it gives you a chance to see how life was back in 1896. We get to see the type of clothing that people were wearing, we see the type of buggies that they were riding in and we get to see a casual day as people went across this bridge."

      "name": "A unique disaster flick that gathers support by story, not SFX",
      "reviewBody": "This is the original film adaptation to the popular science fiction novel by Komatsu Sakyo, Nihon Chinbotsu. The scale of the disaster and the uniqueness of the implications has never before been matched by any film (except for probably the remake). Here&apos;s why: Nihon Chinbotsu is very simply about Japan Sinking in to the ocean. With great eruptions of volcanos and tremendous earthquakes, the homeland of the Japanese will completely disappear along with their factories, landscapes, cherry blossoms, cultural artifacts, and the homes and lives of millions. And none of these things can be rebuilt. The Japanese do not rise out of the ashes with a will to reconstruct their nation, the Japanese do not find hope in the rubble, there is nothing. The homeland is lost forever and the Japanese will have to live amongst people they have no ties with, in a culture foreign and a language unknown, amongst hatred with the label a refugee forever.\n\nYou can clearly see that this movie is not the traditional disaster flick. If you just want to see exciting heroics and special effects, this movie will not deliver. It&apos;s an old film and from 21st century standards, the visible strings and cheesy explosions cannot satisfy. But the movie makes up for it in substance. The story, the characters, the despair, is all believable. The questions raised like, are the Japanese worth saving once they&apos;ve lost all their economic power? And because the story takes place in Japan, of course the people also begin to consider dying with their homes.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely a must watch especially if you&apos;ve seen the recent remake or don&apos;t have time to read the book. If you&apos;re Japanese, take the extra moment to think about what you would do in this situation and this movie will leave a lasting impression on your mind.",

You&apos;ll know how I felt, but not what the movie is about: you should see it unknowingly. Let it take you by surprise. For a very long time, no movie made me feel like leaving the theatre. But, having this policy of always giving the director a chance to either create a last-minute surprise effect or to prove himself ridiculous to an unspoken degree, I usually stay - even if I would vote zero for some. &quot;Darwin&apos;s Nightmare&quot; had me moving in my seat, sweating, swallowing nonexistent saliva, squeezing my hands into each other, thinking about all and nothing. Two times I simply had to close my eyes, many times I thought I had to get up and go - not that the documentary film was bad. Quite the opposite. Formally, it was too good. That&apos;s why it was so bothering. Maybe an overly emotional reaction, but we will all have different ones. Personally, this is the type of story I cannot dissociate of, and view as a spectator. This is the world, and this is tragic. Now: we all know it. We just didn&apos;t see it like this before. Not with this cutting-edge cruelty.\n\nI could feel the tension around me, the tension inside the theatre, the discomfort that it rose. Yet, the laughter that a few purpose-made cynical scenes originated hurt like knives. I couldn&apos;t believe people laughed in such a movie (and then again, I heard people laughing during &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot;!!). \n\nThere is no reason to laugh. A few times, actually, there are plentiful reasons to cry. This movie hurts. It&apos;s poignant to the point of being unbearable. Sad. Tragic. Violent - the story is cruel, and Hubert is cruel as well. Or realistic. He does not make it one bit easier for the viewer. Rather is the viewer allowed to suffer, to sink in shame, to open his/her mouth in awe, to see reality, the dark reality of many places exactly as it is. Besides all, presented in a very intelligent format, and with a cunning sense of fairness and discipline. It was painful. It worked on me, and I only wished it would be over. Personally, this was no film, this was a severe blow in my stomach. I wonder how will it feel to those who actually have no idea about life... 10 out of 10. How could I give it less...?",

      "reviewBody": "Russia was in the silent year of 1905, at the dawn of its first revolution; the historic upheavals to come were already beginning but in the meantime, the population was still full of resentments, in particular towards the Jewish minority. That is why the Jewish youngster Dame Hanna Segal leaves her village hoping to find refuge with her brother Jakow, a rich lawyer who was converted to Christianity, in the city Saint-Petersburg.\n\nIn that city Dame Hanna will find an old friend of hers, Sascha, who has joined a group of revolutionaries; among the radicals is Herr Rylowitsch, who later denounces his companions to the Russian authorities and who, dressed as an itinerant monk, begins making anti-Semitic speeches. Herr Rylowitsch with the support of Herr Fedja, once Dame Hanna&apos;s childhood playmate, will provoke a pogrom against the Jewish population in Dame Hanna&apos;s village.\n\n&quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot; was the fourth film directed by the Danish Herr Carl Theodor Dreyer in the silent year of 1922; it is not a well-known film but has survived in different prints in four different silent archives around the silent world. The film was a German production and had the participation of many international actors ( including the Polish film director Herr Richard Boleslawski who would later have a career in Amerika ) although Herr Dreyer preferred Russian actors for the main characters of the film because he thought that they were better than the German actors ( this is one of the reasons for the eternal enmity among those countries ).\n\nThis Herr Von would like to highlight overall two interesting aspects about this film; the first one is that the oeuvre was based in a successful novel written by Herr Dreyer&apos;s countryman, Herr Aage Madelund, a writer who lived through the horrors of the Russian pogrom. This background is evident during the first part of the film because Herr Dreyer gives much importance to the details of the social facts and the origins of the pogrom ( discrimination, prejudices, defamation ) and how this affected our heroine&apos;s daily life and her surroundings, first in her village town and then in Saint Petersburg . The consequences are carefully depicted in the film.\n\nThe other striking element of the film is at the end when the tension towards the Jews finally explodes during the pogrom sequences, astonishing the audience with the vitality of the images ( excellent montage ),and the realism of the violence and brutality where the fury of the masses toward the Jews is shown mercilessly; a powerful meeting of film and history.\n\nAnd what&apos;s in the middle??... well, the usual tempered pace typical of Dreyer probably due to Herr Dreyer&apos;s interest in being faithful to the novel but the film seems excessively literary during that part, and there are too many intertitles explaining those complicated social and political facts. Still, the action picks up as the narrative proceeds.\n\nObviously &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot; is not a perfect Dreyer film for this German count it seems too ambitious, uneven, wandering in a monotonous way, especially in the middle of the film, as this Herr Graf mentioned above. In spite of these flaws, it is, after all, an interesting early oeuvre of the Danish director with many remarkable moments that any silent film fan around the world would appreciate to watch.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must dance the horah with a Jewish heiress.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a great trailer for this film that shows a couple on a date talking about a movie they just saw.  It shows them in various locations and at each place, they&apos;re involved in animated discussion about various aspects of the film.  Then suddenly, the sun is rising and the couple discovers they&apos;ve been talking all night.  When the woman realizes the hour, she takes off in a mad rush.  She is late for work.  When she arrives, she finds a couple of people floating face down in a pool.  They are dead.  She is a lifeguard. The tag line for the trailer says something along the lines of &quot;The Minus Man, it&apos;ll have you talking for hours.&quot;  It&apos;s a clever trailer for an even more clever movie!!\n\nHoly Hampton Fancher!  This guy is amazing.  He wrote the screenplay from a book by the same title.  The script is so incredibly well written that it really DOES leave you talking for hours.  Each character is so dimensional you could eat them like a multi-layered subway sandwich.\n\nOwen Wilson does an amazing job playing the likeable Vann.  So amazing in fact, that not only does he manage to melt everyone&apos;s heart in the town, the audience falls in love with him too.  That characteristic is key in creating a believable, and deeply dimensional, disturbing character.\n\nBrian Cox is also amazing as the masochistic, fatherly landlord.\n\nJaneane Garafalo breaks out of her &quot;I&apos;m so unamused&quot; role, to play a fairly carefree, almost naive small town girl.\n\nSome people have commented that this film moves too slowly.  In making it, Hampton Fancher said he wanted it to move like a lullaby.  Well, that it does.  And it is as sweetly sung a lullaby as I&apos;ve ever heard.  I cuddled up into my theatre seat and sat back and enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nI could go on and on for hours and hours about the complexity and implications of this movie,  but I won&apos;t so you can go and enjoy it yourself!  Then email me. We could talk about it for hours.\n\nA Must See.  One of This Year&apos;s Best!!!",

      "name": "Movie Review: &apos;The Housemaid&apos;",
      "reviewBody": "In this remake of a popular 1960 Korean film of the same name, Jeon Do-Yeon plays the titular character, Eun-yi, who is hired as an upper class family housemaid, tasked to take care of the family&apos;s small daughter and her pregnant mother, Hae-ra (Seo Woo). Overseeing her efforts is Byung-sik (Yun Yeo-jung), an older housemaid who has been with the family for a long time and holds many secrets. Hoon (Lee Jung Jae), the master of the house, takes advantage of his social position and begins a secret affair with Eun-yi. Once it is discovered Eun-yi may be pregnant, Mi-hee, Hae-ra&apos;s mother, plots a way to get rid of Eun-yi&apos;s unborn baby despite Eun-yi&apos;s wish to keep it and leave the house.\n\nWhile the original film was a suspense thriller, this one isn&apos;t quite as easy to pinpoint. While there are aspects of an erotic thriller, this film is partly a character study and a satire about class struggle. The film starts off with a random suicide as a girl jumps off a roof onto the busy street. This event isn&apos;t really related to the main plot, unfortunately (which I admit would have been more interesting to follow up on). The scene portrays a cold, apathetic society as kids pull out their cell-phones to take a picture. Thus, the film starts off with a bit of a dark, off-kilter, cynical feel.\n\nOne of director Im Sang-soo&apos;s previous films, The President&apos;s Last Bang, was a satire focusing on the assassination of the dictatorial Korean president Park Chung Hee. While this film isn&apos;t particularly comedic as that film, it has elements which seem heavy-handed and too outrageous to take seriously. As a thriller, it isn&apos;t very convincing. One of the obvious problems is the portrayal of Eun-yi, who is shown here as sympathetic, naïve, and more of a victim, the opposite of the original. Unlike the rich folks, who eventually take advantage of her, she is likable and kind.\n\nJeon Do-Yeon does well with the role that is written for her. As good and fine as she is in almost every role she plays, it truly would have been something special to see her play a really mean, nasty character—there is no doubt it would have been a wonderful departure and a suitable challenge for this talented actress. Then again, I suppose it&apos;s like asking Natalie Portman to play Annie Wilkes from Misery. It&apos;s just unimaginable. Would it have been cool to see? Of course. The real villain role is given to Hae-ra&apos;s mother, Mi-hee. She plays the all-too-familiar &quot;evil stepmother&quot; role that appears to frequent Korean TV dramas as of late. Yun Yeo-jung is memorable as the older housemaid, Byung-sik, who remains constantly interesting and complex. Lee Jung Jae plays the rich master role with aplomb and brings subtlety to what is relatively a simplified and underused character. Advertisement\n\nThe film has some great visuals, particularly the interiors of the mansion, full of deep reds and whites. The camera work is hand-held and rougher near the beginning, particularly in the street scenes, and becomes more static and calculated as the film focuses more on the rich family. The film is sexually-charged and the seedy nature of the relationship between Eun-yi and Hoon, along with their motives, is never quite explained.\n\nThe story is overly simple, I felt, and I expected more twists, more believable characterization, more thrills, or something. The problem with satire is that it often pulls the audience away from fully engaging with the story or the characters, an issue that doesn&apos;t particularly work in a thriller. Perhaps it might have been better if this had not been a remake. I would guess that the fear of comparison with the original could bring a director to go the complete opposite direction in the newer film or try to turn what may be a simple story into high art (and appear intelligent). I just wish they&apos;d just make it better by changing the name, the plot, andwell, simply being a whole new film. I suppose on the positive side, a remake does introduce a new generation of audiences to check out the original. In this particular case, I&apos;d love to see the original just to see how much better it is than this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Made at a time when the cinema was exploring new freedoms in language, violence and sex, this is a somewhat tough character study which is tame now, but had to be pretty gritty then. Sinatra is the title cop, a man who bucks the system at times, but has an innate core of fairness. When a wealthy homosexual is found slain and mutilated, Sinatra and his partner Freeman set out to find the culprit. Meanwhile, Sinatra reflects on his troubled marriage to sophisticated, but oversexed Remick. He arrests thuggish Musante for the crime and wins a promotion for his trouble, but, soon after, a young woman (Bisset) comes forth with a case that may be tied into the original one. Sinatra gives an assured and believable performance, though it is jarring at first to hear him bandying about terms like &quot;penis&quot; and &quot;queer&quot;, etc... Remick is attractive and effortlessly sophisticated as his wife who can&apos;t seem to keep her knickers on. The supporting cast is made up of great pros who offer a lot. Meeker is a jaded, slimy fellow detective. Klugman does well as a family man cop who helps Sinatra crack cases. Duvall is menacing as a hard-nosed and prejudicial policeman. Musante is so over-the-top it is unbelievable! His interrogation scene is a lesson in extremes (and helped sideline his US career for a while.) Bisset is lovely, as usual, but was shoehorned in (costumes and all!) at the eleventh hour for Sinatra&apos;s estranged wife Mia Farrow and the part doesn&apos;t fit her as well. She&apos;s meant to be a slightly boyish type and that&apos;s a tad easier to do on Farrow than it was on Bisset. Bochner is a little too cartoon-campy as a vaguely sinister psychiatrist. Though today&apos;s audience will likely find many things to pick apart with the story, it is nonetheless a fascinating glimpse into what Hollywood&apos;s depiction of gays was at the time. One unintentionally funny scene involves a dockside parking lot in which scores of gay men crowd into the back of cargo trucks and snuggle - fully clothed! There&apos;s also a groovy trip into a velvety gay bar. The film&apos;s chief flaws are its overuse of LENGTHY flashbacks and a hugely distracting habit of having Sinatra and Remick deliver lines directly into the camera, a big no-no except in comedies or quirky dramas. The flashbacks are necessary in order to flush out the romantic story, but they tend to be disjointed and overlong. The issue of speaking to the camera could have been easily solved by just having the actors act opposite each other. This was an experiment that just doesn&apos;t work. But the film has a fair share of interesting dialogue, situations and visual appeal. One amusing line has a forensic specialist telling Sinatra that the victim was a homosexual. Sinatra looks around the overdone apartment and says, &quot;Looks like he was a leader!&quot; Moss Mabry got quite a workout coming up with outfits for Remick, less so for Bisset."

      "reviewBody": "Some people might say that 60 minutes is not much of movie, but since each regular episode of the Piet Piraat series is only 5 minutes long, this movie offers 12 times as much adventure on Piet&apos;s ship &apos;De Scheve Schuit&apos;. One of Studio 100&apos;s more recent franchises, &apos;Piet Piraat&apos; is to &apos;Kabouter Plop&apos; what &apos;Big &amp; Betsy&apos; is to &apos;Samson &amp; Gert&apos;. Well, that&apos;s not entirely true. While Big &amp; Betsy is exactly the same show as Samson, only with different characters, Piet and Plop are slightly less indistinguishable from one another, though they share the same duration (the aforementioned 5 minutes). Both Piet and Plop are classic children&apos;s characters (a pirate, a gnome) with their own distinctive supporting characters. Being a pirate, Piet is subject to slightly less childish catchphrases, though he does wear a patch of a teddy on his hat instead of a skull and bones. However, that did not stop the Dutch satirists of Koefnoen create their own spoof &apos;Ridder Rob&apos;. Piet also has his work cut out for him if he wants to equal Plop&apos;s impressive amount of cinematic outings, though, being a pirate, he should actually have an advantage adventure wise.\n\nAnd why shouldn&apos;t Piet Piraat try his luck on the big screen? As Studio 100 had the standing set of Piet&apos;s ship on hand and the 4 cast members under contract, all they had to do was add a Dutch guest actor and some CGI effects (strangely enough, there are no new songs, though the version I saw was preceded by a medley of older Piet Piraat numbers). All the characters are already established, catchphrases and all. Piet Piraat (Gert Verhulst lookalike Peter Vandevelde) is a good natured Pirate who never actually robs anybody, but spends his time looking for treasure. Piet always addresses his crew members by their first name and Piet Piraat is not related to the character of the same name that was mentioned on &apos;De Bereboot&apos; (1976).\n\nAt the helm of De Scheve Schuit is big hipped, Stien Struis, the strongest woman on the seven seas. She only refers to her shipmates by their last names. Berend Brokkenpap is the ships&apos; cook and probably the character with the most faults. He likes to refer to himself in the third person. Rounding out the alliterating bunch of sea dogs is Steven Stil, who never calls the others by any name as he is unable (or unwilling) to speak. All four of the characters keep their headgear on at all times (like the villagers of Anatevka).\n\nAt the start of the film (after the medley of Piet Piraat hits and the ominous looking opening credits) Berend is begging Piet for some time off to take a vacation in Palerimos. Berend, you see, wants to perfect his own form of Pirate-Golf. But Steven Stil has fished a portrait out of the sea, which turns out to be cursed. Kaptiein Snorrebaard (Johnny Kraaykamp Jr.) has been trapped inside it for exactly a hundred years, and has only three days and nights to find the object that cursed him, a golden crown, and get someone else to put it on and take over his curse. Luckily for him the crew of the Scheve Schuit are all rather dimwitted and easily persuaded to go along on a mad quest past singing sirens of the sea and cgi shark to find the fabled crown.\n\nKraaykamp is a welcome addition to the cast, funny and villainous at the same time. It has become a tradition in these Studio 100 productions to have one Dutch guest star in every film, as the pictures have their biggest audience in the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, not the French half (or the German region). This means, the Dutch market is a welcome addition to make a profit. Although the story is quite obviously inspired by a certain &apos;Curse of the Black Pearl&apos; and the Mis en Scene is very theatrical (the characters tend to line up behind a table instead of gathering around it) and the final sword fight between good and evil is not all that spectacular. Still, there is something lovable about Piet and his shipmates that makes their first big screen adventure very enjoyable. Especially as you&apos;re within the right age group, naturally. I mean as far as I know, most children would rather grow up to be a pirate than a garden gnome. Here to hoping Piet will give old Plop and the girls from K3 a run for their money on the big screen in many more sea-worthy adventures, accompanied by many interesting Dutch guest stars.\n\n8 out of 10",

I never even knew it existed until today.\n\nNow, I must stress, this is not a good film at all: awful dialogue, slow pacing and practically no story at the center of it. The machines inexplicably behave like people, when there is no reason for them to do so, and the people characters may as well be machines. The movie fails entirely at making you care for any of them or buy into any of the nonsense taking place. But it&apos;s also one of the quirkiest films you&apos;ll see, with striking visuals all the way through, and technical excellence in all the other departments.\n\nIf I was to try sum it up in words, I guess I would have to say it was a cobbled-together hodgepodge of Tron, Sleeper, Short Circuit, A. I. and Batman Returns, filmed by Wes Anderson from a script by an 11-year-old written on a Speak N Spell.\n\nSo no, it&apos;s not a good film, but it is sort of charming, in an 80s time capsule kind of way, and a pretty thing for your eyes to look at the once.",

It is a sweet story full of redemption for many characters, not a shoot em up, car chase movie so maybe it is not enough for many viewers. \n\nIt is a very good film and I would highly recommend it to all. The acting is excellent and the direction sharp. It&apos;s a great reminder of how some of the more difficult times in this country have contributed to the world we live in today. Of how as humans we control our ability to forgive and forget or not.\n\nMy only real criticism is about Julie Stiles character Rosie, I kept waiting for her the truth of her interest in the story to be revealed it just didn&apos;t quite work for me.\n\nBut all in all I would say it was a great first directorial effort and I look forward to his next project.",

      "reviewBody": "I urge readers to watch this. \n\nThe story is touching and human. A family man who is seized by a new inexplicable love that tells him the old love, what he used to think as love, was merely peace and habit, and yet he can&apos;t be sure. Is the new one merely passion? Does he have a right to betray the trust? Deny himself happiness? It is the most profoundly troubling question that I imagine can arise in a lifetime.\n\nThe film is merely one possible outcome, how making a choice can upset the whole universe, the question itself is much more difficult and deep. If you&apos;re 18 the gravity of it might not register, you still have second and third chances ahead of you. But after a certain age, I imagine it becomes entirely cosmic, entirely about choosing the last person you&apos;re going to know and love. \n\nMy only quibble about this is the stifled Germanic presence all through the film. I&apos;m talking about the deliberately inexpressive faces, pauses and careful poses, people arranged in symmetries around objects, none of which is artful in my world. Well art can be anything so it is not that so much as choosing the world you&apos;re going to live in and I&apos;ll have none of that stylized pouting in my home, suffering can never be an aesthetic.\n\nYet in this hard shell there is a softly pounding heart of beauty.\n\nOne is how this harsh German presence is softened by the afterglow of a sweeter sun and rolling Mexican landscape, which is where the film takes place. Mellowed in this way it brings to the fore a quality I admire in Protestants: simple lives, joy in austerity and nonattachment. Though it came from historical necessity, it&apos;s still the closest thing to Zen we&apos;ve known in Europe.\n\nThe other thing is even simpler yet that much more beautiful. The film is shot in long quiet sweeps of ordinary nothing, those who keep in touch know I am frequently vexed by this technique because it so often becomes merely about style instead of sculpted insight, a garment worn a certain way. \n\nTranscendent vision in film, which is at its most powerful, is about unconcealing a fuller sense of world, broader horizons. It cannot be a proclamation of love but a gesture that embodies what it means to; words are just too easy and cheap, whereas the visible action is itself the commitment.\n\nHere we have something that is elegant and simple in just the right measure.\n\nIn the story we have new love that extends from the old, a new feeling, new beginnings one after the other, not always the one desired or anticipated. \n\nAll through the film we have a dozen or so subtle metaphors about just this feeling of unconcealing a new world, of reaching an end which is only the start of the next landscape.\n\nMy favorite are the following two. A combine threshes a wheatfield, a violent, clustered image of uprooting, only to arrive at the end of the field at an open horizon of fields. And even greater, during the river scene, the man and soon-to-be betrayed wife embrace as their children wash below, still close, their bodies leave the frame and we&apos;re left for several lingering moments in the hazy unfocused space of their absence, only for the camera to slowly find and focus on a blossoming flower.\n\nBreathtaking!\n\nSo when she departs in the end and miraculously comes to again, it the same inner blossom from nothing, call it a sense of the mother still being in the world. The world does not end so long as we keep this anticipation of presence, fields to see after this one, new people to love, never bogged down by loss. The hazy landscape of seeming nothingness already contains the flower, in that scene it is neither there as we don&apos;t see it nor not there as it is there to be found, and this all has its meditative sense. \n\nI&apos;m glad for this film. From now on, whenever it happens that I have to try and illustrate the Buddhist notion of emptiness, or shunyata, I will reach for this one scene.\n\nSomething to meditate upon."

The court testimony of Terri is almost worth the film. \n\nJack Lemmon goes on to make so many great films while we are left to Italian dubs of Virna best. She has had a stellar career in Italy as she has ages oh so gracefully. At 68 she is still a babe. Virna and Sophia as a 70 year old women show the pure glory of womanhood. \n\nWith How to Murder Your Wife I laugh, I lust and I so enjoy the early sixties social comedy films that are absent Rock Hudson.",

In the future, the Sims style online gaming, where people live vicariously through characters, has evolved to living out real-life, in the real world, via surrogate robots. Everybody stays home all the time, 24/7. They work, play and travel via their surrogates, from the comfort of their home.\n\nI&apos;m not spoiling anything here -- this all happens in the first 5 minutes. The result of this new era of existence is the dramatic drop in violent crimes, sexually transmitted diseases, death by accident, etc.\n\nWell, it&apos;s a great concept. And the CGI is good. Because of the plot, every character is insanely pretty, so the screen is filled with beautiful people.\n\nBut... it just... doesn&apos;t... quite... gel. The whole thing feels like a cool episode of Star Trek, or something on TV. The story is not riveting. I didn&apos;t really care about the characters. The timing was off; things either came too late (I was bored, expecting them) or so fast I couldn&apos;t really appreciate.\n\nSurrogates lacks that wow-factor.\n\nExample of bad timing: At the start, one wonders, &quot;What do the users really look like? Anything like like their surrogate robots?&quot; I would expect that, at first, we see Bruce Willis, just some facial hair which his robot doesn&apos;t have. Then, eventually, we see that he is older than his robot, so he&apos;s &quot;cheating&quot; on age too. Even later still, maybe we&apos;d see an obese person at home posing as an athlete via a surrogate which looks nothing like him. Well, &quot;Surrogates&quot; skips all that build up and goes straight for the punchline: within 10 minutes we see a hot chick robot making with a young man; turns out the hot chick is actually slovenly a middle-aged man. Any twists to come later, in this variety, loses all punch.\n\nWorth a rental.",

The clashes between these two groups were inevitable, and this film depicts that struggle brilliantly, without preaching to us or hitting us over the head with it. All the acting, singing and dancing are extremely well-done, and the cinematography, while Luhrmann-esquire is engaging. Best of all perhaps is the music. This film is destined to be a classic, and will always be on my favorites list. The only thing I would change is that I would retain the original title. The audience for this film is sophisticated enough to handle it.",

I saw it in theaters as a kid and later a few more times on television in the Sixties and it disappeared after that. I think it would be worthwhile to get out on DVD and Blu-Ray if for no other reason than for American kids to know why so many public schools are named after this French guy.\n\nLafayette has become the symbol of Franco-American comity and as we know our relationship with France has not always been easy. In fact when the French recognized the American colonies as independent they sent any number of people here officially and unofficially as the American Revolution became a European War as well with world wide theaters.\n\nWhat was different about the Marquis de Lafayette was that he was an idealist and really bought into all the ideas of our Revolution. Folks like General Rochambeau and Admiral DeGrasse were rather haughty in dealing with us colonials, Lafayette never so. In fact the way he adopted the childless George Washington as a father figure was one of the great stories coming out of the American Revolution.\n\nMichel Royer was a spirited Lafayette, he was a name unknown to Americans, but had a substantial career in French cinema after this. You&apos;ll see a number of familiar names dotting the cast, but the two that stand out are Howard St. John as George Washington and Jack Hawkins as British General Charles Cornwallis. Each perfectly fit my conception of both men. And St. John&apos;s scenes with Royer are special.\n\nHopefully this will get out on DVD and soon.",

He hurt himself when he didn&apos;t stretch properly for a workout in 1970. That was the big inaccuracy\n\n-Bruce auditioned for another role in early 1965 before the role of Kato was offered to him.\n\n\n* other roles he took in America were completely ignored: &quot;Marlowe&quot;, his appearances on &quot;Longstreet&quot;, etc...the movie went right from 1967 to 1972 within a minute\n\n\nIf you want to see a really good special on Lee, as well as see lost footage from a project that was butchered after he died, check out the AMC documentary.\n\n -"

      "reviewBody": "The film can be approached from two angles; as a comedy and as an important contemporary cultural text. As a comedy it succeeded beyond expectations. Part of the pleasure surely came from the spectacle of the event; a sold out screening with cast and crew present along with regional cultural references that resonated infectiously with many in the audience, but this can take nothing away from the many levels of comedy at work within this film. There were elements of overacted screwball comedy; there were underplayed facial expressions and reactions that added a wealth of character and personality to the comedy; further still, there were elaborately constructed situational set pieces. All these elements along with explosively dynamic dialogue that was well delivered combined to send the audience into tears of laughter.\n\nIn a separate issue to the comedy there was the cultural commentary, which is always going to draw attention when it is such a taboo subject as Jihad: a word that is often avoided at all costs. The film unapologetically offers a plethora of questions around motivation, meaning and justification which it never falls into the trap of giving patronizing, melodramatic answers to nor does it preach any solutions.\n\nThe many characters were all utilised to give different points of views and different perspectives; the main protagonist Omar (Riz Ahmed) was fully fleshed out, with the other characters used to offer differing ideas and obviously the above mentioned comic relief. Omar&apos;s brother for instance had such a minor part but raises questions around what he considers a true following of Islam, which he promotes as peaceful, but is then exposed as intrinsically sexist due to the way he practically locks his wife in a cupboard. That being said, Islam itself was to a large extent sidelined and the film much more overtly dealt with identification and senses of belonging for a demographic that has partial but not complete grips on the many angles of where its identity is created; this includes Barry (Nigel Lindsay), the Caucasian convert amongst the group.\n\nFour Lions is easily funny enough to reach a very wide audience, where viewers will be left without answers and therefore forced to discuss these issues, which are too often brushed under the proverbial rug.\n\ntwitter - @destroyapathy",

Kable (Gerad Butler) is a convict who was wrongly framed for killing and condemned to death penalty . Castle (Michael C Hall) is the manager of a game show wherein convicted delinquents are given the chance to run to freedom but have to elude the stalkers; men who hunt them down and kill them in gruesome manners . With full control over the media, Castle attempts to quell the nation&apos;s yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is ¨Slayers¨ . 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) controls Kable and leads him around the battle camp . After massacring most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the war zone . Kable arranges to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere the show&apos;s next contestant. Furthermore , we watch Kable&apos;s spouse named Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a rare role in Society . Angie also is controlled by a fat man . Elsewhere, the convicts for Slayers are being transported to the next battlefield . Kable gets escape and tries to free Angie .\n\nThis stirring picture displays noisy action , thrills , lots of violence and some doses of nudism . This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched , an action movie you&apos;re going to see in a while . It&apos;s stylishly made, with lots of tense action from the beginning to the end to keep one satisfied. The motion picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectaculars scenes . The tale packs unstopped movement and is extremely entertaining for action lovers and video-games fans . The battle scenes are made with authentic stunts but also by C.G.I . This story about a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad is professionally told , though it results to be a post-modern version of ¨The running man (1987)¨ by Paul Michael Glaser and based on a Stephen King&apos;s novel . Directors, writers , producers Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine present an eye-popping glimpse at the television of tomorrow . This witty slice of sociological future world keeps the action flowing throughout, and presents us with some bizarrely fascinating villains , especially played by Michael C Hall , as well as the usual action frolics. One query, however , is over the high level of violence and some erotic scenes that contain this exciting film . Rating : 5,5 . Acceptable and passable .",

Sadly these are extremely difficult to get to see. There are of course elements of propaganda for the Russians as &apos;liberators&apos; but only with the TV mini series &apos;Holocaust&apos; and of course &apos;Schindler&apos;s List&apos; did these issues very belatedly get addressed by Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors is set in Western Ukraine (Carpathian mountains) circa the 1860&apos;s. It was banned in the USSR because it emphasized the unique Ukrainian culture and in fact the language throughout the film was Ukrainian and not Russian. Plus the references to the Church and religion could not have helped. The story is deceptively simple. As a child, Ivan falls in love with his neighbor and fathers killers daughter Marichka. The first half of the film deals with that love and the second with Ivan&apos;s downfall after she dies in an accident.\n\nShadows would probably not appeal to someone looking for great acting, strong characterizations and emotional pull. But, it more than makes up for these deficiencies in its visual brilliance and authenticity of periodic detail. This is one of the most beautiful looking films ever made. The elaborate costumes, the folk songs and simple village life all create a world that you know just had to have existed. Not exactly commercial fare, Shadows is a stunningly beautiful looking film and in fact a lesson in old Ukrainain culture. I highly recommend this for art-house film fans.",

      "reviewBody": "The whole marketing of this documentary is misleading. Noam Chomsky is indeed in it, but he speaks very generally about corporations and capitalism, not the music business specifically. Even the DVD menu has Buckethead on it (the only artist on the DVD menu), when Buckethead is in the film only for 30 seconds, and even then he&apos;s just performing on stage. Again, he offers no opinions about the music business.\n\nIt didn&apos;t say anything that anyone with the slightest bit of interest in music beyond the radio doesn&apos;t already know. Noam Chomsky and Douglass Rushkoff were the only two intellectuals, the rest of the talking heads were band members. It reminded me of many conversations I&apos;ve had with my friends, only a few of which play music, but all, like most people I know, love it. There&apos;s nothing new here. I was hoping for the state of the modern music business (the internet was only mentioned once I believe), not how much the old model sucks. It didn&apos;t touch on medium-size independent labels like Victory Records or Fueled by Ramen.. in fact, it didn&apos;t touch on independent record labels at all.\n\nAbout half the doc (literally, nearly 45 minutes of the hour and a half) was of people performing music, which would be OK, if it were a &quot;sounds of country, blue grass and blues&quot; documentary. I think the director really likes his blue grass. The constant cutting back-and-forth between the talking heads and musicians was a little distracting, pretty redundant, and got very old very quick. I ended up fast-forwarding all the music parts (I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy blue grass/blues/rockabilly stuff). Again it seemed misleading, like the director thought &quot;this is my film, and I&apos;m gonna cram it full of my favorite local bands to give them some exposure.&quot; In a documentary about how big record companies Are Not Good, the constant live footage of blues/country/folk/whatever musicians added very little.\n\nI wanted to like this documentary - I love underground music, love film, and, like the director, am from Kansas City (it made me smile to recognize radio stations and music stores), but it&apos;s my opinion that it failed in its intentions.",

He returns to the house of his aunt Beatrice Schröder (Naima Wifstrand) and is initially supported by his sister Agneta (Bibi Skoglund) since his fiancée Blanche (Marianne Gyllenhammar) has called off their engagement and his friends have abandoned him. When Agneta goes to the university, the young servant Ingrid (Mai Zetterling) helps Bengt in his daily life and falls in love with him. But she overhears a conversation between Bengt and Beatrice when his master belittles her calling Ingrid of &quot;little maid&quot;. Bengt travels to play piano in the restaurant of a cunning manager and finds humiliation and loneliness. Years later he meets Ingrid, who has studied and is near to graduate and he falls in love with her. But Ingrid has a boyfriend Ebbe (Bengt Eklund), strong and handsome, and Bengt has to fight with his inferiority complex first to win the love of Ingrid. \n\n&quot;Musik i mörker&quot; is a melodramatic romance by Bergman with fight of classes in the darkness. Only recently the firsts films of my number one director have been released in Brazil by Versátil Distributor and all of them are bleak non-Hollywoodian romances. Birger Malmsten is again the lead star and the sweet Mai Zetterling is impressively gorgeous with her wonderful eyes. It is amazing the fight of classes in this period of Sweden. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Música na Noite&quot; (&quot;Music in the Night&quot;)",

Sarah Douglas is his former wife who left him for a religion or the religion&apos;s leader. Believe me you won&apos;t care.  But it is nice to see her as something other than a villainess and this the only good I can say for the &apos;movie.&apos;  There are terrible sets, if you can call them that, terrible acting, editing, writing, and music that might have seemed advant- garde for 1979 but is just noise now\n\nThe most hilarious scene in the movie is the assassination attempt on Birney, it is something straight out of Ed Wood with the brute assassin foiled by the glare of some quartz or crystal that Birney picks up or it might be the performance art piece that the desert people put on or the performance art that the daughter does after killing someone or Douglas getting her eyes taken out by pet crows or...\n\nIf you are expecting a movie based on  the Asimov story forget it but if you are a Northern Californian New Ager wondering what might have been then you might like this movie.  Not Really."

Super 8 says it. This is a private memoir. The memoir of a handful of people who make their living in a cultural spasm between Western and Eastern Europe. On the road in the West, at home in the East. When their bus travels by a pet cemetery with marble terriers and German shepards, each with a carefully engraved name, who wouldn&apos;t think of the mass graves of Srebrenica and the Kosovo? Who would? Perhaps, that&apos;s the difference between them and their audience.\n\n They joke and they play. They are angry, upset and hurt. And they joke and play again. If the clownesque does not win out, it is at least there. As a survival strategy. As a commentary. As absurd as the pet cemetery and the bombed bridge. As absurd as the applause and the oversized gold jacket.\n\n Unlike any other Kusturica movie, this one shows its materiality, the texture, the grain and the cut, as if to explore what stuff memory, history is made of.\n\nIt is a multi layered text and like any other of Kusturica&apos;s films, it is also a political statement. Wanting to go home, the accordion player crosses the river like Charon the Styx, because the bridge is destroyed like the Bridge on the Drina.",

      "reviewBody": "One has to question the basic premise of the film: creating monsters to destroy Earth so the aliens can take over. Why not just create a bunch of zombies to do the job faster?\n\nThis low budget science fiction/horror film is significant for two reasons.\n\nIt is the third in the Waldemar Daninsky/Werewolf series, and the only one were the Count plays a supporting role. It stars Paul Naschy as the Count, and he also wrote the story. Patty Shepard, who plays Ilsa in the film, also starred with Naschy in two other Daninsky features. An American who moved to Spain to star in over 50 Spanish films, she died this year.\n\nIt is the last film of Michael Rennie, who played Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still (The 1951 original).\n\nI don&apos;t know where the title Frankenstein vs. Dracula comes from, as Frankenstein was busy killing the Count over and over, even when he was in bed with one of Dr. Warnoff&apos;s (Rennie) assistant. At the end, Frankenstein takes on the Count after he transforms into the Wolfman. Place your bets as to the outcome.\n\nInspector Toberman (Craig Hill) seems to know all the tricks against the monsters in his mission to save Ilsa.",

If you begin watching this film expecting to be taken into the monastic way of life, you will soon find yourself there. The movie takes the pace of the slow, quiet atmosphere of the monastery. Long periods of silence broken by the occasional creak of floorboards or chanting or bells, and very little dialogue. It is like each shot is a photograph. A moving photograph.\n\nIt is not entirely what one expects, however. Keep an eye out for the odd object seemingly out of place: the highlighter, the keyboard, the laptop; the odd conversation on a monk&apos;s departure for Seoul, South Korea; the shot of monks sliding down a snowy bank on their bums.\n\nI wanted more explanation - how the individuals chose this way of life; how they sustain their community; what contact they have with secular people. But it is not that kind of documentary. As long as you&apos;re prepared for that, it is a film worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "Blind Mountain is an excellent film about a college girl being duped into going into a mountain village and left there &quot;sold&quot; as a bride and her attempts to escape and get back to her family. The plot sounds trite but Yang Li&apos;s excellent direction and the crisp editing along with superb performances in the main roles, make this into a twisting horror story and the viewer knows not, where the plot is going.\n\nApart from the main role of Bai and the teacher, all other actors were actual mountain village people which is startling in the uncompromising look at their culture and the hard lives ingrained into their faces, there are also some real, now rescued, &quot;brides&quot; playing themselves in the film. \n\nAlthough the film as a good social point to make, it&apos;s not preaching or forcing the issues on you but rather asking you to examine the situation. To the villagers, this is just life and it&apos;s always been this way, to observers they seem inhumane. Although the film obviously brings up the issue of the one child policy, these villages and bride trafficking have been going one since long before that policy was put into affect and still does in many parts of the world, not just China.\n\nYang Li was in the audience and took questions at the Hawaii International Film Festival. It was annoying to see the Q&amp;A get hijacked a little by feminists wanting to make a point and answering their own questions but other than that the director was frank and forthcoming about his film.\n\nExcellent.

When one of Lana&apos;s earlier beach boy dalliances washes up on the Acapulco shore dead, will grouchy, self-loathing Robertson, egged on by gigolo from Hell Hugh O&apos;Brian learn that his bitter, stormy, (but quite sex-filled) marriage to Lana is exhibit A for the proposition -- &quot;LOVE HAS MANY FACES&quot;? \n\nThis movie is one of those that is destined for that dismissive category &quot;so bad its good&quot;, on the basis that its star was older than was fashionable for a sex symbol, and many of the men spend much of their time showing their manly torso to over age women. Since the subject is uncomfortable, the safe response for the male reviewer is to giggle, mock, and move on.\n\nBut the movie has real strengths despite its garish exterior, and Lana Turner, dressed in best screen siren style, and photographed so that the wrinkles are vague, but the smokin&apos; hot body is in full view, may never have been put to better use in a movie. Hugh O&apos;Brien, too, plays a loathsome character with such bare chested charisma and relish that one could conclude the whole Wyatt Earp TV show thing was epic miscasting. Thios isn&apos;t Shakespeare style emoting, but it is good solid acting by people who know how to keep the melodramatic plot fizzing along. Acapulco -- the setting under which all the eye candy is displayed -- looks great, too.\n\nSo, if the acting is good, and the melodrama solid, what&apos;s the problem? Mostly, Cliff Robertson, whose self-loathing is all encompassing (and really annoying) Also, the movie maker&apos;s ambition to get every male torso properly displayed does at time slow the action down to a crawl. Finally, the motivation of some of the characters does not make a whole lot of sense.\n\nBut this is a movie worth the time, and not just for the giggles.",

      "reviewBody": "The unlikeliest of partners, Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin are chained together and make a jail break together from a Georgia road gang. It&apos;s now the Nineties and objections about a black and white convict being chained together are now passé. Even with race not a really big issue with these two guys as it was in The Defiant Ones, they&apos;ve still got a lot of other problems.\n\nThe most curious thing about this is the interest the Feds have in this jailbreak. They&apos;re keeping the Atlanta PD cop who busted Baldwin in the loop, but at a distance and this arouses Will Patton&apos;s curiosity no end. US Marshal Robert John Burke is playing things way too close to the vest to suit Patton.\n\nBaldwin&apos;s who they&apos;re after. He&apos;s a computer hacker who hacked into a holding company that the Cuban Mafia owns and ripped off 25 million dollars. The local Cuban don, Michael Nader, wants him real bad. The wild thing in this film is that he&apos;s the only one in the cast who is what he says he is.\n\nA couple of current beauties, Selma Hayek and Brittany Powell, decorate this film as love interests for both Fisburne and Baldwin. Hayek is introduced rather clumsily into the situation that our escapees find themselves in.\n\nIn fact the film, enjoyable though it is in many places, could have been a lot better with a much tighter script. Director Kevin Hooks did a good job with what he was given. In fact Kevin Hooks got to cast his dad Robert Hooks in a role as the Atlanta PD supervisor for Patton.\n\nFled is not a bad film, it could have used a lot of improvement though in the writing.",

It is agreed to be an &quot;open&quot; marriage, where each can leave at any time with no questions asked. The film tries to answer the question: what happens if either of their former loves came back and want them? That is exactly what happens in duplicate - both loves, Myrna Loy and Lester Vail, return almost at the same time and want their former sweethearts back. I enjoyed watching the stars perform even though the story was routine and the final outcome was never really in doubt.  The supporting cast, especially John Halliday, was all very good. Myrna Loy was still stuck in her &quot;bad girl&quot; roles.\n\nWatch for the scene where Dunne and O&apos;Brien drive by New York&apos;s RKO Mayfair. Its marquee is emblazoned with lights heralding two RKO features shown earlier in 1931, A Woman of Experience and Millie. You can even pick out ZaSu Pitts on the marquee, but a large screen TV and a VCR in the slow motion mode will help.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been to thousands of movies in my lifetime and own hundreds of videos and DVDs, so I am a fan but not a bona fide film critic.  This is my first online review.\n\nMy wife and I saw the original Dawn of the Dead 25 years ago at a midnight show and left wired enough to talk each other down till the morning. Perhaps a quarter of a century has inured us to the violence a bit since we just watched it again (rental video) last week prior to yesterday&apos;s venture to the local multiplex to see the remake/&quot;reimagining&quot; and were mostly unperturbed by the revisit.\n\nFor some reason, I was hooked on the new Dawn months ago from the teaser and, subsequently, the actual trailer.  The Sparklehorse song in the former fit perfectly and the suburban shot followed by killer Vivian and closing with the burned projector film of the latter was intriguing in its own way. So I was primed to see the movie, usually a recipe for disaster since preview expectations are rarely fulfilled by the finished product.  This time, however, they were.\n\nThe cast was uniformly believable and, more important, empathizable (at least with the good guys who got sorted out along the way).  Even the playboy jerk had several relevant lines.  Polley was a good, strong female lead (with another great rebuttal -- &quot;No, I&apos;m a * nurse&quot; to a query about her medical skills) and Rhames a cheerable, if reluctant, hero.  The camaraderie, such as it was, worked, and visceral me-first survival gave way more often to self-sacrifice.\n\nSo, what&apos;s not to like?  The fundamental premise that a classic got remade? Doesn&apos;t wash.  These are two different movies with the same name and similar premises but very different attitudes.  (Better special effects didn&apos;t hurt, either, although this new version was oddly less disturbing sans zombies munching on dismembered body parts.)  Speedy zombies (except for the &quot;twitchers&quot;)?  No problem; hey, they&apos;re hungry and, as always, persistent. My attention was held for the better part of two hours; the story was interesting; the outcome ambivalent; the characters arisen to the task at hand, becoming coldly rational to the divisions between life and death and zombiedom; the music weirdly appropriate; the black humor welcome respite. No, Dawn of the Dead isn&apos;t Citizen Kane nor is it a sacrilegious assault on the horror genre.  It&apos;s solid filmmaking that&apos;s entertaining and thought-provoking.  Otherwise, I suspect Romero would never have put his imprimatur on the remake.",

I saw some music clips on Youtube from this clip and read how many songs this movie features and I thought it&apos;s impossible to get all these songs in 100 minutes. In fact, they put more songs in it than I expected. Burdon is singing throughout the story, on stage and there is many soundtrack anyway.\n\nThe acting is very natural and the story is about music business, wishes for freedom, sex, drugs and much more. Burdon plays Rocco and goes through the hell in this movie, like he did in his musical career.\n\nThe story and the actors have many faces, it&apos;s an art film with touches of a mainstream motion picture.\n\nThe most important songs are &quot;Sweet Blood Call&quot;, &quot;Who Gives A F**k&quot;, &quot;The Road&quot;, &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot;, &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot;, &quot;Bird On The Beach&quot; ( a song about freedom etc.), &quot;You Can&apos;t Kill My Spirit&quot;. Other songs included are &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, &quot;Take it Easy&quot;, Streetwalker&quot; and many, many more.\n\nOther well-known actors are Julie Carmen, Michael Cavanaugh and Dan van Husen.\n\n&quot;When you&apos;re dead, you&apos;re great&quot;.

Crazy chick tries to split her roommate from her boyfriend because he is type B. Nice premise, however, this only takes a very short time, the rest is just the guy being a jerk and the girl being really patient. In the end, he just falls in love with her, contrary to the character he showed until then.\n\nBottom line: easy to watch romantic movie, with Korean quirks, something like a reversal of The Taming of the Shrew.",

But what Z-Bob (Penn) thinks is a fool-proof plan to a wild night in Vegas, ends up as a chase across Vegas in what would be a weekend they would never forget.\n\nVegas Baby really tries hard to be a truly funny comedy film, but falls flat most of the time. There are jokes placed around, but these come mostly from Lin Shaye (who shows more than needs to be seen) and the unknown Himelstein. The main comedic draw of the film, Kal Penn fails to present any funny jokes at all, that he is known for.\n\nI&apos;m Cassandra. I also teach preschool.  Cassandra (Lin Shaye)",

I tried to put myself in his position, having to break the news of their mother&apos;s death to the two youngsters, and it almost brought me to tears, as the end of the movie actually did.\n\nThis movie is a fitting tribute to the young Americans who fight and sometimes die for the country and for the families of those who wait for their return; when sometimes the waiting is in vain.\n\nWhether the war is a just or unjust war or whether it&apos;s useless debacle, young men and women die whilst fulfilling what is, in their mind, their duty. The validity of the war detracts nothing from their heroism.",

The images, the dialogues and the music are very powerful. Of course it omits the question of democracy under the rule of Dalai Lama but anyway nothing can be worse than Chinese oppression and total violation of Tibetans&apos; human rights under the eyes of an indifferent West which seems to think that human rights must not be equally valued everywhere and that human rights of Kosovars are more important than human rights of Tibetans. And we won&apos;t discuss either in this context if religion is the opiate of the people or not. In this case we prefer to state that we respect all religions and beliefs. As a matter of fact Buddhism is more a philosophy than a religion. The important thing to say is that this story is true and we hope that movie will contribute to open the eyes of the so called democratic countries to the drama of those people and force them to condemn Chinese authorities overtly for it and stop the hypocrisy of showing great indignation (sometimes feigned)for some human rights&apos; violations while at same time disregarding some others even more brutal.",

      "reviewBody": "When his fiancé Beth is raped and murdered during a robbery, peace-loving rancher Vern Haskell sets out to track down the man that did it. Driven by a desire for revenge more than justice, Haskell follows the trail to a casino and bordello called Chuck-A-Luck. Here he follows his leads to Alter Keane and gunslinger French Fairmont; they take him onto their staff at their horse ranch and gang HQ and Haskell hopes to use his cover to get his closer to finding out who it was that raped his girl. However in keeping his cover, Haskell finds himself drawn into their world more and more.\n\nThe staples of westerns of the period are all here  revenge, Technicolor, songs and romance; however this film opens with a rape (and it is fairly obvious that it was a violent rape) and a nice man who descents into violent anger. In a way the film makes this its central theme but it doesn&apos;t continue in this very strong vein and softens it somewhat with the addition of romance and musical interludes. From here on in it is still enjoyable but never marks itself out as more than a solid genre western; the complexities that I had hoped would consume him were not to be found in Haskell to any great degree. Despite this the plot still works well enough to engage and the gruff pace avoids sentimentality and makes the tough romance easier to swallow in context. The action is roundly enjoyable and Lang directs well within the sets, providing some good shots that stick in the mind.\n\nThe cast are mixed but generally meet the standard required of them. Dietrich may have demanded she be made to look as young as possible but her age helps stand her apart from the usual love interest actresses. She is tough and enjoyable in her role but I could have done without the songs. Kennedy is reasonably good but not too comfortable with his character  he is either a white knight or a gurning ball of rage; subtlety is not his key word. Ferrer is lively and fun and makes more of his character than the genre usually allows the &quot;other man&quot; character to do. Support from Elam, Reeves and others is all solid enough to make it work.\n\nSo an enjoyable genre western then but a bit disappointing for throttling back after such a tough start. The standard revenge plot is made more interesting by the change in Haskell but it could have been better; meanwhile the usual action, songs and romance all work pretty well and will easily please genre fans."

We witness such awesome sights as W.A.S.P.&apos;s Chris Holmes getting loaded in his pool while his mom sits pool-side contemplating a very late abortion.  Our old pal Ozzy&apos;s juice-pouring methods are something to behold and my new favorite band Odin sits in a hot tub with a bunch of metal-sluts and tells us how they want to be bigger than Zepplin and the Stones.  This is intercut with their live performance where the lead singer expresses less range than Mark Slaughter and has no ass in his pants! We hear about struggling metal-heads who use women for their money and their food (they of course plan to pay them back with furs and cars when they get big.)  And the always entertaining Poison treats us to a healthy dose of rock n&apos; roll stupidity.  This film contains some of the stupidest people I have ever witnessed.  Why it won no Oscars is beyond me.  I think it is one of the truly great films of the decade.",

The boy was incredible, he was so natural that he needed NOT to play the role. he was himself all the time. The rest of the actors were also a good base to the whole movie. It is so much hilarious that I was LOL -ed every time I watched this movie. Most probably the feeling will be different in any other languages than Hungarian. I give a rating 10, just perfect in any sense and I don&apos;t mind who says what on this movie. I feel sorry for all those who don&apos;t speak Hungarian, they will not get the absolute perfection of this art of moving picture. A brilliant gem from Hungary. Blessed by living on the border of Serbia and Hungary that I speak the language and it made my day every time!",

Two divers find a treasure map, which apparently points to a sunken treasure below the ocean. They hire a professional to help them get the gold but this guy turns out to have a few secrets of his own. This is a rather strange German film that is being sold in the recently released &quot;Grindhouse Experience Vol 2&quot; collection but those expecting anything like that are going to be disappointed because the film is certainly PG rated from start to finish. The film actually isn&apos;t too bad as we get some nice underwater photography, which certainly steals the show. We also get several close up looks at various sea creatures including an octopus and a Hammerhead shark. What doesn&apos;t work is the actual screenplay, which is rather bland and doesn&apos;t offer anything new. We get the same turning on each other aspect as well as various members of the crew having secrets. The ending when the divers are attacked by Mexican pirates is pretty over the top. Another annoying thing is that every time the director builds up some suspense it&apos;s over before it begins. In one scene one of the divers is surrounded by sharks and can&apos;t float up to the top but then the very next second he&apos;s up on the boat and we never get to see how he escaped. This film isn&apos;t bad but it&apos;s nothing special either.\n\nIt should also be noted that the DVD features a good, full screen print but there are forced Japanese subtitles."

You know that they had a great time making it because it&apos;s clearly evident on the screen. George of the Jungle is simply just a Tarzan parody. (Ape-man meets girl, falls for girl, leaves for city, returns to jungle). But the predictable plot doesn&apos;t destroy the performances and the movie is peppered with some laugh out loud jokes.\n\nOf course the special effects are impressive - a talking ape, an elephant that thinks he&apos;s a dog - but it&apos;s the humans that steal the show. Fraser is fantastic as George - he is one of the most talented actors out there at the moment - though this film doesn&apos;t test his range much, he shows a nice comic flair. Mann is a lovable foil for our hero, though her squeaky voice is at times too cute. None of the other characters disappoint. Both Mann&apos;s parents are great in supporting roles and Lyle as Mann&apos;s nasty fiance is sensational.\n\nKids will love this. Adults, I think will find a lot to enjoy in it also, but don&apos;t bring along any cynics. They&apos;ll miss out on all the fun!!",

      "reviewBody": "Rug is a movie in which the protagonist is a beautiful Persian rug. The rug is displayed on grass, under a tree, and the shifting patterns of light play across the rug&apos;s surface.\n\nTheir are nightingales woven into the rug. In Persian poetry, the Nightingale symbolizes &quot;the devoted lover yearning to become one with the beloved.&quot; As we see the rug, we hear a voiceover reciting Persian love poetry, including references to nightingales.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t suggest a long documentary in which we see nothing but the rug. However, six minutes of rug was delightful. This movie has too few IMDb ratings to mention in this review. I enjoyed Rug, and rated it 8.",

The character he played was such a wet lettuce it was unbelievable, and Phil was sooooooo annoying you were left wishing that he would sustain a more serious injury throughout the film...\n\nArgh!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNot recommended!"

      "reviewBody": "The previous film in the series was incredibly entertaining and sophisticated... those are some big shoes to fill, even for the same writers and main cast. Fortunately, they not only wore them, they made wearing them look *good*. More of the trademarks are added, probably the very last of them... ironically, this was originally supposed to be the last in the series. Fortunately, it was such a huge success that more were produced. We finally get Ove Verner Hansen as Bøffen, the part he was born to play... a Mafia-esquire hit-man who takes great pleasure in his work. Coupled with Bjørn Watt-Boolsen as the thoroughly capitalistic and only somewhat criminal business-man, we have the recipe for a delightful piece of Danish comedy with the Gang. With immense amounts of tiny clever details, this is sure to keep you laughing. The plot is very well-written, and takes our leads down a new path(though basically towards the same destination), with another variation on the opening scene in front of Vridsløselille state penitentiary. The pacing is flawless. I wasn&apos;t bored for one moment, even knowing most of what was coming. In addition to the aforementioned two recurring characters, Ole Ernst finally takes over as the younger police official, portraying a cowboy-ish, eager young detective. He compliments Axel Strøbye&apos;s dry, experienced, fed-up and realistic/pessimistic investigator perfectly. This and the next one are the only two that start in the Gang&apos;s dream destination... Mallorca. The humor is satirical and has that wonderful touch of humanity, making for pure hilarity. With fewer coincidences and easy ways out of situations than in the previous films, this is among the best of the series. Taking the audience along both to Zurich, Germany and the Danish stock exchange, and featuring the memorable shot of the balloons being released, this also has some of the most good-looking shots of the films. I recommend this to any fan of the series or any fan of Danish comedy in general, but I definitely recommend having seen the others before this. 8/10",

If something this by-the-numbers, and cheap looking came out of Hollywood it would be rightly slated, but for some reason, being Japanese excuses this? This film offers NOTHING original, it&apos;s an obvious linear plot that only someone very young, or someone who doesn&apos;t watch many films couldn&apos;t preguess everything that happens.\n\nIt&apos;s about a guy training to join the Japanese coast guard, he gets teamed up with the well-meaning screw up and thus gets the bad end of the stick in every competition. He rallies his friend to not give-up blah blah, and so it continues. The opening scene is an unbelievably obvious attempt to set up a finale that will tug the heart strings, but is just sentimental embarrassment.\n\nThe first time I saw this, it was on Japanese TV and I couldn&apos;t understand the dialogue, but the story is SOOO obvious it didn&apos;t matter in the slightest. The sequel and the TV spin-off are typical cash-in projects, and I don&apos;t imagine there&apos;ll ever be plans to release this internationally even though it was a massive hit in Japan. It&apos;s almost one of those so-bad-it&apos;s-good gems, but the reviews seriously calling it a good film are way off.",

      "reviewBody": "In the summer of 1946 Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal approved the largest naval task force, 13 ships and 4,700 men, since the end of the Second World War to sail from Norfolk Virginia to the cold and ice capped seas of the Antarctic to map that unknown and frozen continent as well as monitor the vast and untapped natural resources hidden under it&apos;s frozen surface.\n\nThe film &quot;The Secret Land&quot; is a documentary narrated by actors Robert Montgomery Robert Taylor and Van Haflin about that fabled expedition call Operation Highjump and the men who were on it. Who suffered through it&apos;s deadly cold winds ice flows and the dreaded coming of the Antarctic winter that may well have spelled doom to all of those sailors and merchant marines on that perilous expedition. \n\nLed by Admiral Richard E. Byrd and Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen Operation Highjump did what it set out to do, by mapping some 1.3 million square miles of the unknown Antarctic continent. There also was a number casualties among the ships and men on that voyage. The most noted was the USS Sennet a submarine that was crushed in the ice off the US base Little America. \n\nLeaving from the US port in Norfolk to the southern most part of the Pacific Ocean to Scotts Island and Little America on the Antarctic land mass. Aircraft carrier USS Philipine Sea the flag ship of task force 63, Operation Highjump, had on it&apos;s deck six giant RD4 supply planes who, with Admiral Byrd aboard, flew over the frozen wastes of that continent and photograph it. \n\nIn the end the expedition was considered to be a major success but over the years it has all but been forgotten by the American public but It&apos;s good to see that the movie &quot;The Secret Land&quot; is still around and is being broadcast periodically on TCM to rekindle interest in that major post WWII event. \n\nEven though Operation Highjump was conducted over fifty years ago many of the photographs and documents on that expedition are still classified and there&apos;s the strange explanation of Admiral Byrd&apos;s missing three hours, when he flew over the South Pole in February 1947. Having the American public told that Byrd&apos;s RD4 had to jettison most of it&apos;s equipment to avoid losing altitude and slamming into the dangerously high Antarctic mountain ranges, that in some places are as high as 20,000 feet, that had communications cut off between him and the US base on frozen Antarctic coast. That explanation didn&apos;t wash with a lot of the people who listened to the Admirals radio broadcast as he flew over the pole. \n\nThe broadcast by Admiral Byrd suddenly went dead for a number of minutes and there are those who think that it was done on purpose, by the US Navy, to keep the American public from knowing just what he saw there. \n\nThere was one fantastic discovery by the Byrd task force that didn&apos;t escape the attention of the American media and public as well as the lens of the movie camera. That was the discovery, off the Shacklenton Ice Shelf in Wilkes land, of a place later named the Bunger Oasis. \n\nFlying over the ice and snow US Navy Let. Commander David E. Bunger spotted filmed and landed on this 300 square mile patch of land with tricolor fresh water lakes that were totally ice-free right in the middle of the blistering cold and freezing Antarctic! The lakes in the Bunger Oasis were the colors, red blue &amp; green, of the vast amount of colored algae in them and even now, over a half century after the Bunger Oasis&apos; discovery, nothing in the world of science has been able to explain it.",

      "reviewBody": "OK, so I didn&apos;t have particularly high expectations for this, and I&apos;m not going to bother emphasising Curtis Jackson&apos;s flat performance, since it&apos;s likely you&apos;ve seen how &quot;expressive&quot; this guy is in everything else he&apos;s ever done, as it is, if I know he&apos;s in a movie, I already have a pretty good clue that he won&apos;t be the highlight.\n\nSo what else have we got? Ryan Phillippe, and Bruce Willis... OK, Bruce pulls out a reasonable performance, but he really doesn&apos;t have much to work with, due to a muddled, thin script.\n\nSo of course the same difficulties apply to Ryan Phillippe, however, since he has a much larger part in this it&apos;s difficult to see that his performance is OK, and really he&apos;s let down by the poor script.\n\nWell, look, Curtis Jackson, I&apos;m not sure why this guy wants to be an actor, for the moment he&apos;ll have to keep wanting, because he hasn&apos;t pulled anything out the sack with this one. It&apos;s not that his performance is dreadful, it&apos;s just ... empty, and he really isn&apos;t bringing any soul to his character, and I&apos;ve got to say, I really hope he gets better than this, because I know he&apos;s going to keep trying.\n\nAnyway, if you watch this, brush the sick off yourself and go watch Way of the Gun so you can forgive Ryan Phillippe.\n\nIn summary even casting a lead that could act probably wouldn&apos;t have save this shoddy script, but there&apos;s a few good moments that will entertain.",

      "reviewBody": "Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood&apos;s trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it&apos;s trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don&apos;t we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen. \n\nThe GOOD  Cute/Kid Friendly  Funny  Good animation\n\nWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn&apos;t think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored. \n\nBut cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats. \n\nAnd a small bonus, that really shouldn&apos;t be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities. \n\nTHE BAD  The Story  Lack of Uniqueness  Trailers showed you a lot of the movie\n\nWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn&apos;t fare that well. Oh it&apos;s not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn&apos;t really set any time limit or urgency to the tale. \n\nTo add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn&apos;t really that unique of a movie. We&apos;ve had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn&apos;t have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is definitely a disappointing factor. \n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe Secret Life Of Pets is exactly what the trailer promises, fun, entertaining, and wildly adorable. Younger audience members, as well as those very young at heart, are the target group for this movie hands down. It has the laugh factor certainly, and the cast of characters are a motley crew that I certainly enjoyed. However, the story is very simplistic, the lack of emotional suspense, and that much of the movie is told in the trailers make this movie not the most memorable of the summer. I can&apos;t say it is worth a trip to the theater in comparison to some of the other kid movies, but it makes for a good family outing. \n\nMy scores are:\n\nAnimation/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",

      "reviewBody": "I had actually never heard about this 1989 martial arts action movie titled &quot;Bloodfist&quot; before here in the beginning of 2023, as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch it. And with it being a movie that I hadn&apos;t already seen, and seeing that Don &quot;The Dragon&quot; Wilson was on the cast list, of course I opted to watch it.\n\nWriter Robert King apparently must have had been watching the 1988 movie &quot;Bloodsport&quot; prior to writing the script for the 1989 movie &quot;Bloodfist&quot;, because there were some massive similarities between the two movies. Of course &quot;Bloodsport&quot; is a far better movie than what &quot;Bloodfist&quot; turned out to be. And with that being said, don&apos;t get me wrong, because &quot;Bloodfist&quot; is not a bad movie, not at all. It just was a somewhat watered down version of &quot;Bloodsport&quot; with some tweaks to the storyline.\n\nThe acting performances in the movie were okay. I mean, you know you&apos;re not in for an evening of Shakespearian performances, of course. But for a martial arts movie, then the acting performances were fair enough, and as to be expected.\n\nThe martial arts sequences were, for the majority, good enough to watch and came off as being watchable. There were some scenes that were sluggish and amateurish, and not all the fighters were really convincing in their styles and fighting, especially Michael Shaner (playing Baby Davies).\n\nI actually found &quot;Bloodfist&quot; to be an enjoyable movie and entertaining movie, despite of the similarities to &quot;Bloodsport&quot;. If you enjoy the martial arts movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s, then you will definitely also find enjoyment in director Terence H. Winkless&apos;s &quot;Bloodfist&quot; movie.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Bloodfist&quot; lands on a five out of ten stars.",

It is a must watch for a Ajay Devgn Fan!! \n\nAt that time, Ajay was mostly known for action movies.. Ajay&apos;s crispy dialogue delivery, brooding eyes and superb acting makes it a good watch!! It is a visual treat when Ajay and Amrish Puri face off each other with intensive dialogues emoting mostly with eyes without going overboard or mindless shouting!! Kajol doesn&apos;t have much to show, songs are average, Vinod Khanna, Ronit Roy and Kader Khan are good at their roles!! I had become a huge fan of Ajay at that time only and liked his initial 90&apos;s movies like Jigar, Vijaypath etc !!",

      "reviewBody": "Having decided not to do the Frankenstein monster, Bela&apos;s next film for Universal was this rather stagey thriller about a demented doctor trying to mix the blood of an ape with a virgin.  The story is a bit far-fetched, and Lugosi is as over-the-top as he can get, but for the most part the film is good, solid entertainment.  The film is a bit slow, and its has no music in the background.  Add to this some stoic acting on the part of the cast as a whole(Lugosi excepted of course)and some frequent, flat direction from Florey(say that a few times quickly).  Florey shows flashes of brilliance(many of them coming through the magic of Karl Freund&apos;s camerawork) with scenes such as Lugosi&apos;s pitch in the carnival tent, Lugosi murdering a street prostitute, and the finale of Paris above ground.  Florey is also remarkably mundane in many scenes too, adding little depth to many of the characters as well as not creating enough suspense where always needed.  Florey does deliver more often than not, however.  This film is a good example of the traditional Universal horror film, as well as vehicle to display the talents of one Bela Lugosi.  Look for Arlene Francis(of What&apos;s My Line fame) as a prostitute tied to a cross of woodbeams(possibly one of the best sequences in the film)."

It seems to me that the director was trying to put too many different facets of emotion in the film... abandonment, grieve, anger, despair, self pity, humor, hatred, cynicism. As a divorced mother of six, some of the lines &quot;hit too close to home&quot; so that tells me that the essence of the pain was captured. I am still thinking about the ending which really surprised me. I can&apos;t even begin to imagine how a wife who felt as she did could handle that. All in all it was a good movie, and I recommend it to anyone who has lost control of their anger in trying to deal with disappointment and resentment.",

      "reviewBody": "I recommend A TIME TO LIVE AND A TIME TO DIE as a great introduction to the films of Hou Hsiao Hsien, who I consider the greatest director working today.   Like most of his films, this one is about the telling of history, the effort to recreate the memories of the past, in this case his childhood memories growing up in rural Taiwan.  His family has escaped Communist China but live as if they will make their return someday. That someday never comes, the family grows old, and members die one by one.  These tragedies (filmed with heartbreaking solemnity) serve as punctuation marks for the film&apos;s narrative, which isn&apos;t so much concerned with plot details as it is with capturing the sense of what it was like to live at that time, as the kids develop their own sense of belonging, in a country they have adpoted just as it has adopted them. His method of editing and storytelling is something close to revolutionary, and he would refine it in his later films.  His ability to set  scene after impeccable scene and let the ideas ferment over their totality is unparalleled.  This is perhaps his most accessible film, full of heart and pathos.  It may seem slowgoing by Hollywood standards, but if you have the willingness to let it wash over you, you will be transported, both mentally and emotionally.",

      "reviewBody": "The Pigeon That Took Rome is an acquired taste. It&apos;s a quirky comedy with sarcasm dripping thickly in the narration adjoining the scenes. Charlton Heston is in the lead, and while it feels a little awkward to see him in a comedy, since it&apos;s a dark, offbeat comedy, it makes more sense. Set in Italy during WWII, it focuses on the antiquated system of carrier pigeons. There are misunderstandings, miscommunications, and mistaken identities - all with the pigeons. I&apos;m not kidding.\n\nIn addition to the pigeons, there are the group of American soldiers stationed in Italy who act alongside them. Charlton Heston has a reputation of being disliked among his men, but since he gets the job done, Brian Donlevy puts him in charge. Do you think falling in love with an Italian woman, Elsa Martinelli, will soften his heart? It&apos;ll take quite a lot of softening, since he&apos;s reprimanded his fellow soldiers for similar dalliances - or as he phrases it, &quot;going nuts over a piece of Italian pizza at a time like this.&quot;\n\nWhen his friend tries to convince him of the virtues of settling down to a wife and kiddies, Chuck scoffs. &quot;Why is everyone supposed to like children? How many kids do you think there&apos;d be in the world if they weren&apos;t connected with sex?&quot; I know; you&apos;ll have to hear it to believe Charlton Heston actually said that line. I was shocked, too. I laughed a few times during this movie, but it&apos;s not one I&apos;ll want to watch again. It&apos;s tough to get political satire right, but this movie certainly tries.\n\nDLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. About 20 minutes before the end, when Arthur Shields is seen through the window, he&apos;s upside down and the camera swivels to make him right side up again, and that will make you sick. In other words, &quot;Don&apos;t Look, Mom!&quot;",

You just about hear what the others in the audience are thinking throughout. I also loved the little pieces of humor. The little girl in Strings is a total delight!

      "reviewBody": "Madadayo chronicles the life of a retired professor who lives vicariously through all the students he has taught.  The students admire him greatly, he is visited often and many stay to listen to his whimsy and foolish stories. The professor is a child at heart, and not much really happens.  The film doesn&apos;t have a plot really, and only 2 things start to focus around the story one being the loss of the professors house after the allied bombing, and the loss of a stray cat he adopts years later.\n\nTo the viewer though there is much in between stories and people to digest such as a great celebratory dinner that is held every year, and so on.  To some degree I will admit I liked the camradare that I witnessed, the great dialogue, the professors childish personality, but I wanted the film to move forward and to at least give me something to focus on.\n\nThe lost cat scene was a good distraction but it did go a little more longer than neccesary. I find this often sometimes in Kurosawa&apos;s work (The lost gun in Stray Dogs, following the suspect in High and Low reminded me of this). However, the hallmarks of his great filmmaking are apparent in the dinner scenes, cinematography, and conversations.  He also provides scenes that the viewer could take as obligatory (such as a death, or the possible return of the cat), but Kurosawa changes this so the outcome is not what you expect but refreshing.\n\nHowever, the best is saved for last... litteraly.  As I was waiting for the film to end, the hallmark of greatness arrives without question in the span of what must have been only 5 minutes.  The ending just wraps up everything so perfectly, and it made me from just liking the film to instantly loving it.  It gives a real insight into the professors mind who is greatly admired and respected.\n\nRating 8 out of 10",

I liked the voice talent, although this &quot;the wiener dog has a German accent&quot; thing gets old fast. A lot of people seem to hate this one with a vengeance (look at the distribution of the votes with all those people giving 1), but it still gets a 5.5 average, so that gives you a pretty good idea. This is no Incredibles by any means, but the two little girls I took enjoyed it a heck of a lot more than Cars. Mostly harmless family fun with a few bathroom jokes thrown in: enjoy!",

A very well made blood and guts piece in which the director did a thoughtful job of helping us, the audience members, try to understand the murderous impulses of the killer. In many ways, this movie is more about the cause and affect of violence than the simple blood on the walls shock fest that is so prevalent in today&apos;s horror market... and although I did appreciate the director, Patrick Johnson, taking the time to elevate this piece or at least attempt to do so, I still can&apos;t help but feel he shied away from an element that seemed completely natural to the story; nudity. there should have been more nudity. Movie violence and nudity go together like peanut butter and jelly especially if the killer is a good looking female sociopath. \n\nIf they do a sequel to this little gem, I hope they do it in 3D!!",

      "reviewBody": "I was a big fan of the Tales from the Crypt TV show. Thus, I am a fan of this movie. It feels a lot like one of the Creepshow movies but has enough gore, humor and OTT carnage but it just doesn&apos;t have enough scope to brake away from the TV show and stand alone as a big screen movie.\n\nBrayker (William Sadler) is a drifter who stumbles upon a lonely desert town after an explosive confrontation with The Collector (Billy Zane), a supremely evil being with Satanical powers who is desperate to get his hands on Brayker&apos;s mysterious talisman. Brayker spends the night in a shabby motel but The Collector soon turns up and unleashes hell upon the motel and it&apos;s inhabitants.\n\nThis is where the fun really kicks in. The Collector has fun enticing the residents (made up of Dick Miller, Charles Fleisher, Thomas Haden Church, Brenda Bakke, Jada Pinkett-Smith and CCH Pounder) to join him on his dark quest and steal the talisman from Brayker. \n\nDirector Ernest Dickerson (who also did Surviving the Game) does not hold back on the gore as he spoofs 1950&apos;s B-movies, honor&apos;s the TV show and pays brilliant homage to the Tales From The Crypt comic book legacy. It may be nothing more than a cheap, horror comedy with no artistic integrity but Dickerson still successfully pulls of a movie that will satisfy and entertain anyone who watches it. \n\nHalf of the movie&apos;s appeal lies with Billy Zane who acts out the role of The Collector with such wicked charm and delightful evil. You can tell he&apos;s having a great time and he makes a counterpoint villain for Sadler&apos;s dishevelled hero. \n\nThey could have made more Tales From The Crypt movies, but producers Robert Zemeckis, Gilbert Adler and Joel Silver (Walter Hill and David Giler ducked out) went on to found Dark Castle, the production company behind House on Haunted Hill, Thir13en Ghosts and Ghost Ship.",

It starts out with Bill (Fairbanks) and Toodles (Frank McHugh) being thrown out of the military for gallivanting with women when they should have been reporting back to a base. It is the wrong time to be discharged though; it is very hard to find work even as ex-pilots. Bill meets up with a beautiful stenographer named Patricia (Bette Davis) and the group teams up to find work and take care of each other. Slowly, they get involved in seedier and seedier jobs as their stomachs rumble and find themselves entangled in a dope ring.\n\nA clip from this film was used in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? to show off &quot;Jane&apos;s&quot; bad acting, but Davis does well in this movie. She&apos;s great at delivering snappy lines and proving that you don&apos;t have to be dumb to be beautiful. Fairbanks is the same way, nice to look at but good to listen to as well. McHugh adds flair to the film with his distinct personality which makes him perfect for the best friend part.\n\nThis film is fast paced and enjoyable, perfect for a slow day.",

When I heard John Cusack was adapting it and moving the action to Chicago(from London in the novel), I was a little worried, because I worry about changing things during adaptations for arbitrary reasons, but I needn&apos;t have worried; though I have a few quibbles, which we&apos;ll get to later, Cusack and Co. have done a fine job adapting the novel.\n\nFirst off, I&apos;ve read one comment which claims it stereotypes &quot;music geeks.&quot; The type of people Hornby, Cusack, his co-writers(D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink, who also co-wrote GROSSE POINT BLANK, and Scott Rosenberg), and director Stephen Frears are portraying is a very particular type of &quot;music geek&quot;; the type who is a snob about music.  Almost all of us, I would say, are aggressive about our likes and dislikes when it comes to music, but not many, I agree, compare liking Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel to &quot;agreeing with both the Israelis and the Palestinians.&quot;  And probably not many of us would be so cut off from feelings that, when hearing about a person&apos;s death, would find no better way of expressing their sorrow than listing their top 5 songs about death.  Yet we do like these people as characters because we see even if they have some snotty attitudes, they do have a genuine love for their music, and they&apos;re in a low-paying job because they love what they do. And who among us hasn&apos;t turned to music when we&apos;ve felt sad(or happy), like Rob does, or wished that Bruce Springsteen(and a pox on the person who, in their comments, implied he was passe.  Bruce will NEVER be passe) would talk to us directly like he talks to us through his music?  The novel and the movie captures all of that.\n\nAnother strength, of course, is Cusack&apos;s performance.  Woody Allen once said that while American actors were very good at playing virile men of action, there weren&apos;t many who could play more &quot;normal,&quot; regular people.  Cusack, on the other hand, has carved out a niche for himself playing regular guys.  He doesn&apos;t look like The Boy Next Door, and he&apos;s neither stereotypically sensitive or hip, but comes across as a guy who feels both at ease and yet still longs for something more.  At his best, like in movies such as THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING, THE GRIFTERS, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, GROSSE POINT BLANK, and this, he plays people on the cusp of growing up, who are able to if they want to, but aren&apos;t sure if they want to, and yet he&apos;s made each of them different.  Rob&apos;s condition may be a little more conventional - he&apos;s not sure if he wants to settle down yet - but Cusack, while unafraid to show his unlikable qualities, makes us like Rob anyway.\n\nThe rest of the cast is also quite good.  The well-known names only get short takes(Lisa Bonet, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones), but they make the most of their time.  I&apos;ve never seen Iben Hjejle before(I haven&apos;t seen MIFUNE), but she does well as the most grown-up person in the movie.  But the real stars, besides Cusack and the music, are Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Rob&apos;s co-workers.  Black especially reminds me of people I knew.\n\nAs I said, I do have some quibbles.  There are a couple of incidents in the book which don&apos;t make it to the film which I would have liked to see(the Sid James Experience, and the lady who wanted to sell Rob a ton of valuable records for a ridiculously low price).  I&apos;m getting tired of movies which use rain as an expression of sorrow, and this is an example of overuse.  And the character of Laura isn&apos;t developed as well in the movie as she was in the novel.  Nevertheless, this is well worth checking out.",

Some owners of promising mines find an unexpected death. The old miner Thomas (Silvio Bagolini) gets a stranger (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) and a bounty hunter (Mario Novelli) to fight for him and the other miners against Burton.\n\n&apos;Uccidi Django... uccidi per primo&quot; is a shoddy piece of work from Sergio Garrone who normally shot better westerns. Occasionally, some skills show through, for example the dark, mysterious scene when Burton and the psychopathic killer Lupe (George Wang) are meeting in a cave. But there are many poorly executed scenes. See for example the scene after 5 minutes where the bandits are riding through the gate. The bag with gold is dropped by Aldo Sambrell, but he keeps riding on. Obviously, they did not want to make a second take, so the first take with this silly mistake stayed in the movie. Otherwise, it&apos;s a great role for Sambrell though who dominates the picture, whereas he often played only supporting roles in other westerns.",

Having said that I should probably also mention that this movie was filmed in Japanese and used English subtitles. Additionally, there were a couple of scenes which were a little slow and drawn out. Even so, I thought that both Keisuke Koide and Haruka Ayase played their parts real well and for what it&apos;s worth I rate this movie as slightly above average.",

      "reviewBody": "At 2:37pm in a bathroom at an Adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever.\n\n2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager. The film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers, all intertwined, all dealing with their own personal dramas. While there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix  the beautiful would-be popular girl dealing with body issues, the over-achiever obsessed with his grades, there are several horrors that are as far from main-stream as you can get, including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past.\n\nThe movie is mixed with documentary-style interviews from the characters, which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative. The pace is also a little slow, but it fits with the feel of the movie. The young Australian actors are all stars in their own right, in particular Theresa Palmer who&apos;s heartbreaking performance earned her an AFI nomination.\n\nThe film is very well shot, with terrific direction. Some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the five-minute-long suicide scene, but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its&apos; viewers. It draws you in right from it&apos;s shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom. Ultimately, it&apos;s a beautiful made, but slightly disturbing look at teenage life.",

The characters became very real to me, even Hardenberg, the kidnapped businessman, who was a bit wooden at the beginning. For me, the best part of the film was watching the relationships build between all 4 of the main characters, both before and after the kidnapping. There is really very little action in the film: it&apos;s more about watching the characters develop personally and in their dealings with each other. Lest this sound too dry, I found the film quite humorous at times, exciting and emotionally intense. The conclusion is left open to interpretation--but you&apos;ll have to watch the film quite carefully to have the data you need to make your own interpretation! Highly recommended!",

The film also does a great job of showing the greed that drives some companies and groups to rid the most important life source from other humans. It gives an eerie description that to some, money means more than the essence of human life itself.\n\nThis is a very good documentary that can&apos;t be explained in a few words and everyone needs to watch it!!",

(dont want to spoil more)\n\nall in all a very original and funny movie.",

No, seriously, his eyes are basically two fried eggs! From here, things get a tad absurd.

It&apos;s not typical Elvis in the sense that for once he doesn&apos;t play the irreverent gigolo with a woman waiting for him in every bar; his one big dream is to do music in his own nightclub. He&apos;s quite likable and ends up even being noble when he turns the plot (of a soldier engulfed in an bet with his army buddies to &apos;defrost&apos; a gorgeous nightclub dancer) on its side when he falls in love with the stunning Juliet Prowse. This one is similar in tone to VIVA LAS VEGAS because female lead Prowse is an independent woman, and not a typical Elvis groupie. That&apos;s why I like it all the more. She is never, in my opinion, actually &apos;refrigerated;&apos; even when she turns down a pass from Elvis she&apos;s not so much rude as she is firm in her convictions. But what a dancer- with a pair of gams that stretch into next week!! Her introduction in the film (which shows a spinning cardboard cutout in a marquee window turn into the actual Prowse- in a strapless white, shredded dress) is breathtaking!!"

      "reviewBody": "Monster = hurrah Humans = garbage\n\nAnother Monster-Verse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema. Luckily, I wasn&apos;t disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.\n\nAbout humans: If you want to watch the movie at home, don&apos;t waste time on humans subplot. It&apos;s completely pointless. The dialogues aren&apos;t funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these &quot;characters&quot; are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they&apos;re doing doesn&apos;t make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It&apos;s better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn&apos;t be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.\n\nAbout the monsters: Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I&apos;d want to appreciate the &quot;dialogues&quot; between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don&apos;t use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.\n\nGodzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn&apos;t intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you&apos;re a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don&apos;t expect to see raise of &quot;the new empire&quot; in this movie. It&apos;s a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.",

Short on Story. Short on character development. Yeah I know I am stingy. 4/10.\n\nAnd IMDB has now made it so a review has to have 600 characters before it can be entered. I really don&apos;t expect that to last very long because people are sure to complain about it. But until that happens I guess we have to expect reviews to be long winded and sometimes about absolutely nothing to do with the show in question.\n\nIt&apos;s really not even worth the time reviewing some of them."

But, that said, I thought it was pretty good. I must say though, that Catherine Breillat seems to have a very narrow vision. This really felt in many ways like a warm-up for &quot;Fat Girl!&quot;, although I didn&apos;t think this was quite as good as that was. It somewhat lacked the extreme dynamics and tension that made that film more riveting. This was actually a bit boring at times, especially toward the beginning. Also, the cinematography was completely unremarkable (again, unlike &quot;Fat Girl!&quot;, which used long, uncomfortable single-takes to great effect). And there was really too much pointless talking at times. Still, I wouldn&apos;t say that it is a bad film at all, really. It definitely gets better as it goes on. It even began to remind me a little of &quot;Palindromes&quot; at times, especially toward the end. I&apos;d say that Breillat is definitely a good filmmaker, but probably not a great one.",

      "reviewBody": "Honestly, there&apos;s not a lot to say about this film. Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange star as three Southern sisters who reunite when one (Spacek) shoots her husband. The sisters are, of course, incredibly different and their personalities collide over the course of a few days, dealing with what Spacek&apos;s character has done while old feuds come to the surface. Clearly based on a play, most of the action takes place in the same house and the film puts everything on the shoulders of the three central women.\n\nKeaton plays Lenny, the matriarch of the trio (both of their parents are deceased and their grandfather who raised them is in the hospital) who is socially inept and often gets stepped on by her siblings. Lange is Meg, the popular and outgoing wild girl, man-eater and failed actress. Spacek rounds it out as the potentially insane and murderous Babe. Tess Harper steals her few scenes as Chick Boyle, who lives next door to the house, but the whole thing is centered around the three sisters and that&apos;s what makes it work. The film never takes itself too seriously, despite it&apos;s morbid themes and narrative, and the women all do a marvelous job of bringing the laughs mostly without overdoing it.\n\nCrimes of the Heart is a film that on paper doesn&apos;t appeal to my tastes at all, but I often found myself cracking up at the ridiculousness of these characters. The women play the characters as straight as possible, approaching them as characters rather than jokes, and this helps make it an enjoyable experience as opposed to a grating one, although Keaton does overdo it at times. The characters are erratic and very large, which opens itself up to potential disaster, but in selecting the proper actresses for each role they were able to make it an entertaining little movie. It&apos;s a simple, light and enjoyable film; certainly nothing memorable and I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be thinking about it at all in a few days, but a nice experience while it lasts.",

Doing a Gilda Radner-styled comedy turn, Michelle Avanti impresses in the sex department, deep throating Nate Threat and taking it in the posterior from him.\n\nFlaunting a non-p.c. approach, Ryder is prescient a decade earlier in predicting today&apos;s blatant racism, under the guise of mocking 1960s racism, in a now-relevant scene of Avanti phoning 911 to report &quot;a Negro is in our neighborhood&quot;, when Nate is changed from a toy doll to a living person by star Teagan&apos;s magic spell.\n\nBig-name cast is wasted, especially a miscast Jenna Haze in the lead Elizabeth Montgomery role, while Nina Hartley has a good NonSex turn with red wig imitating Agnes Moorehead&apos;s original performance. Imitation is what makes this sort of junk annoying, as well as the stupid laugh-track."

      "reviewBody": "There has never been another film like &quot;Tabu&quot;.  This is a unique blending of ethnographic documentary and expressionist drama, from two directors who were masters of these forms.\n\nThe actors are real Polynesians and their ceremonies and rituals are faithfully captured, and interwoven with a tragic love story.  The cinematography deservedly won an Oscar - it is truly beautiful.  Murnau, away from his usual studio sets, manages to create the same sense of danger using natural light - especially moonlight - and real locations.\n\nThe performances are very strong - especially Chevalier as the girl, and the old man is as scary as Nosferatu as he haunts her dreams at night.\n\nSadly this was Murnau&apos;s last film - he died in a car crash just before the premiere.  It is a little dramatically uneven, and certainly not the masterpiece that &quot;Sunrise&quot; is, but it is still very worthwhile.",

Bit derivative in parts but at the same time pretty original in others.\n\nI don&apos;t think the OTT zombie like crazy owners added much but the film just about hangs together basically because there is this mood set up and it is never clear what is going to happen next. Good performances from little known youngsters further contribute to making this worth a view.",

She was already known to the public as a child performer singing, and she pursued that career later in Germany as a popular star. However I feel she could have made it in the movies as well and with a more interesting career.",

      "reviewBody": "D.C. Cab is one of those films that make you forget where you are, who you are and what&apos;s going on. It embodies everything you want in an early 80s picture, Filth, Humor, Upbeat Music, Attitude and Mr. T! Joel Schumacher and Topper Carew&apos;s script is very quick, brash and downright hilarious. Having seen Alex Cox&apos; &apos;Repo-Man&apos; I was accustomed to the raw gritty nature of those films that you saw in that era. The film never has a dull moment and it&apos;s full of energy(pay attention to the scene where they try to rescue Albert from the kidnappers) and when Adam Baldwin proves he&apos;s not chicken dung by refusing to surrend cab fare to a hood. Loud and Confusing the lack of rationality and reason pays off in D.C. Cab. A lot of noteworthy and in your face performances by The Barbarian Brothers, Charles Barnett, Max Gail and Marsha Warfield to name a few. Diversity works and this film proves it as we see so many walks of life and personality. There are a lot of good one-liners in this movie and they still stand the test of time...most are produced by the mouth of Gary Busey(He had to be on coke during this, he was off the wall bananas!)\n\nD.C. Cab is a definite must-keep for the DVD-Aficionado and for those who want to laugh, feel nostalgic or just want to get lost check this out. In my opinion D.C. Cab is severely underrated and deserves plenty of accolades. I still chastise myself for not knowing it existed until I caught a preview on VH1&apos;s &quot;I love the 80s 3-D&quot;. Oddly enough, I wasn&apos;t optimistic when I began watching it but afterward I was entertained beyond expectation and I watched it again! Joel Schumacher should be proud of this movie as for the last 10 years most of his films turned out forgettable. A must see!\n\n8/10",

As the movie progresses, a bond of mutual affection develops between the young gunfighter and the old marshall. The marshall tries every way he can to avoid the inevitable gunfight which he know he will win. This movie is essentially about relationships and the differences between youth and maturity rather than just another gunfight. It&apos;s one of my top ten westerns.",

Robert Redford, too, shines here as the sheriff, and almost all the supporting cast keeps up with the two male leads.\n\nBlake&apos;s character is a Paiute Indian who is the object of a manhunt which is sensationalized by the press because of its concurrence with a visit by President Taft. The sheriff is pressured into hunting down the Indian and the girl he loves but whose father has forbidden the match.\n\nIt&apos;s a good solid early-1900s Western with much better-than-average acting. But it&apos;s not so much an action film as it is a character study -- of Blake&apos;s character and, to a lesser degree, Redford&apos;s. It brings to life the racism and exploitation that white Europeans brought with them to America."

      "reviewBody": "Interesting characters and a great cast, but the script really left them with nowhere to go. Bridget Fonda was lovely and I will check out her work in other films (last one of hers I saw was Doc Hollywood in 1991). Will also keep a lookout for Skeet Ulrich who brought a nice blend of charm and mystique to the role of the central character. Christopher Walken is competent as usual, but this is not the sort of part I enjoy seeing him play. Tom Arnold did a good job as the obsessed religious fanatic. I found the labeling of this movie as a comedy strange, but it is hard to say how else it should be categorized. It is definitely a subtle and wry brand of humor. I don&apos;t think I laughed aloud even once. One thought provoking thing about the movie is that it shows that people can do good things without being wholly good, and bad things without being wholly bad. That may sound obvious, but too often movie characters are one-dimensional. For example if someone is exploitive (especially in a comedy), they also turn out to be evil to the core. A better script with some added time for plot development would have made this a much more satisfying picture.",

      "name": "Ming-liang Tsai&apos;s self-portrait",
      "reviewBody": "I saw this film during a festival in which all of Ming-liang Tsai&apos;s feature films were shown over a two-week period. Tsai and Kang-shen Lee were in town for some of the time, and came to the showing to give an introduction, through a translator of course. They spoke for a few minutes about themselves and their relation to the film. Perhaps indicative of Tsai&apos;s small fanbase, only 40 people attended even though the room could easily hold 150. It felt quite special to see the two together on stage in such an intimate setting.\n\nKang-shen Lee started off, recalling that Paris was very cold when they were filming there, and that they ate really good food every night. Each course might take half an hour, whereas when filming in Taiwan they would just chow down a bento box. He also fondly remembered having his picture taken with the Mona Lisa without other visitors around, a perk of filming in the Louvre. He explained that in the film, he played Ming-liang Tsai.\n\nMing-liang Tsai&apos;s remarks went deeper. He said that when he saw Truffaut&apos;s &apos;Les quatre cents coups&apos;, just after he moved from Malaysia to Taiwan, it really opened his eyes. When he was in Paris filming &apos;What time is it there&apos; he contacted some of Truffaut&apos;s actors, which is how Jean-Pierre Léaud got to play a small role in that film. As a young man, Tsai had never imagined one day working with Léaud. For &apos;What time is it there&apos;, Tsai had Kang in Taiwan, and Léaud in Paris. For his film he got the two actors together. He also said filming was a very happy time for him, feeling the close proximity to the Louvre.\n\nTsai went on to explain that &apos;Visage&apos; is really a self-portrait, a film about his innermost emotions. Almost apologetically, he said it would be a difficult movie to understand because of that. But, he said, he realizes most of his films are hard to understand.\n\nKnowing that the film is essentially a self-portrait gave it a lot of context. It is indeed a film that is hard to grasp. Yes, there is a story, but more than that is it a collection of imagery and symbolism that is very meaningful to Tsai himself. He probably made the film much more for himself than for any audience. Armed with this knowledge, I could easily give up trying to understand the film, and just experience it as a view into the man.\n\nThe film contains themes, symbols and imagery that I have seen across his body of work. To name a few: Water running, leaking, dripping. Tape to shut out light. The death of a parent. Sex, implied incest. A fishtank. A cooking pot. Very specific shots of a typical high-rise apartment in Taiwan. There were other free-form scenes that no doubt are very personal to Tsai.\n\nAlso, there was a very interesting moment during the showing. At a point, there is a tracking shot of an actor, who is half submerged in water in an underground tunnel. The shot is in black and white, there is no sound. As the camera tracks, it stays trained on the actor. The camera rig moves sideways, in between the light source and the actor, so the cameraman becomes visible as a shadow superimposed over the actor and the wall behind. It felt like being pulled backwards, away from the action, towards the cameraman. At this moment, a spotlight was illuminated in the back of the theatre, in the same line as the camera and actor. It felt like being pulled further backwards, out of the film and into the theatre. It was amazing how the focus of my attention was shifted from the actor, to the camera, to the audience, because it was so unexpected. After a few seconds the light dimmed again and the film continued normally.\n\nI don&apos;t know if I would recommend this film to anyone, unless they want to get a look into the maker&apos;s head. I think films such as &apos;Stray Dogs&apos; or &apos;Vive l&apos;Amour&apos; are more enjoyable, but as with all of his work, you really have to be into slow cinema to enjoy them."

This film is quintessential De Niro, and he gets all the good lines. There is an interesting revelation at the end, which I will not reveal here. The case everyone is after, is a complete McGuffin, what Hitchcock called that plot device, the thing which everyone wants, and it doesn&apos;t really matter exactly what that is. I think that Frankenheimer may have been paying homage to Hitchcock on this, as what is in the case is never revealed. Apparently David Mamet was the script doctor on this film, and it ended up OK. I am of two minds on Mamet, having liked &quot;The Untouchables&quot; a lot, and disliked &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; and loathed &quot;Oleanna&quot;. I also liked Natascha McElhone, who I had never heard of. She is a beautiful and accomplished actress. Some people complained about her brogue. OK, she&apos;s not Meryl Streep. But then again, who is? A lot of actors won&apos;t even try. I look forward to seeing more of her.\n\nOh, yeah, and some of the car chases were really, really cool, almost McQueenian.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie &quot; The Amazing Spiderman, &quot; has been way over-due. Ever since it&apos;s initial creation by Stan Lee (who makes his usual Cameo appearance), audiences have been hungrily awaiting this new addition. This time, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) confronts a new and incredibly powerful super villain called, &apos;The Lizard&apos;. Self created by a one armed scientist, named ( Rhys Ifans ) or Dr. Curt Connors, Spiderman unknowingly gives the fantastic formula to a desperate man who has been trying to invent a way for a human to re-generate a missing limb, without realizing the unfortunate side effects. From the beginning, the film has a dark, foreboding and sinister aspect, which pervades through the entire story. Indeed, this sequel returns to it&apos;s early history in that the audience is introduced to Parker&apos;s lost parents, as well as his present guardians superbly played by Martin Sheen (Who adds a bit of Panache to the movie and Sally Field. Furthermore, Parker is given a new girlfriend called Gwen Stacy and her father seriously played by Denis Leary. The movie itself is incredible, what with all new high flying action sequences, aerial effects and numerous exciting scenes. Although a bit heavy in using mostly nighttime exteriors, it does lend credence to Parker&apos;s equally somber state of mind. Over all, the film is grimly superior to earlier chapters and is therefore easily crafted to enthrall us. As a result, the cast and crew, have intentionally created a Classic in the process. Easily recommended to all. ****",

At first glance, he falls in love with her. Okay, accepted. In a few weeks, he meets her twice and even goes to her home at night to prove his love. She clearly refuses to meet him, so he slits his hands and writes her name in blood... Okay, accepted. True love exists. But then, one day, some people threaten Kareena for 6 crore rupees, and she makes up a story that she needs that much money in three days. Shahid decides to rob a bank but then sees a rich man. Guess what? This rich guy captures Shahid and turns out to be Kareena&apos;s original boyfriend, who hacks into the bank&apos;s server to steal money.\n\nThe police later capture Shahid, but he escapes, gets shot, and even survives.\n\nDon&apos;t you think this is really too much to digest?\n\nOne star deducted for the poor script, one star deducted for Fardeen&apos;s subpar acting, and one star for the excessive plot armor and cheesy introduction given to Shahid. A few things I did appreciate were Shahid&apos;s effort and Kareena&apos;s acting, which were good. The last scene, where he takes his revenge by taking Kareena&apos;s life, was also quite satisfying. Only because of this, I decided to give it 7 out of 10.",

To say there was no talent associated with this film, well let&apos;s just put down the hater-aid. AJ Hammond, who played Mohammad seemed extremely well trained in the craft. Marcoux was convincing as well. I liked Ginny&apos;s fight scene with Marcoux. I&apos;m not saying there wasn&apos;t over and under acting (by some) peppered through out. It&apos;s hard to not let bad editing and\\or writing overshadow new talent but I believe that some of these actors will go on to &quot;make it&quot; and many critics will be forced to eat their words.",

      "reviewBody": "A highly revealing and informative short documentary that analyses and criticises the U. S. government behind the scenes involvement in overthrowing socialist/nationalist leaders and supporting dictatorial regimes in Latin America and how poor civilians always end up becoming victims of the system. We follow the main events that happened in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Chile (from South America and thrown into the mix due to similarities with how the left-wing parties were deposed). Big money America&apos;s intention was to prevent all of those allied nations in becoming another Cuba and keep their business flowing as the world was facing a polar of opposites with the Cold War and U. S. and URSS trying to conquer allies and win over enemies. Huge paranoia, those countries were only trying to overcome povery, unfairness and fighting for better life conditions and progress - of which capitalism wasn&apos;t helping at all.\n\nThe film by Obie Benz offers a very resumed scope of events related with the changes faced by Latin America nations, especially in the 1980&apos;s (Panama case isn&apos;t featured as it broke out the following year of the film&apos;s release). The interviews with ambassadors and government officials telling all of how things roll and nothing changes as each new American president goes by, is frank and revealing. But when you know history and politics long enough this kind of film only hits on deeper levels with few aspects instead of the whole thing; outside of history buffs, the viewer who&apos;ll get to see &quot;Americas in Transition&quot; will be rewarded with an enlightning and curious piece that can anger you to the core. You&apos;ll see the world in a different manner.\n\nMy small contention with the documentary comes with the omission of South America as an equal case with small variations (the opposition formed by guerrillas on Central America went through with middle-class and intelectuals who went up with arms, creating an armed revolution that challenged militaries in the streets rather than fighting in the jungle). Chile got mentioned as it&apos;s something that the world took notice in a wide manner, but Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil (21 years and started out before all of the mentioned countries, except for Somoza in Nicaragua), and the modus operandi were basically the same: strategic millitary training, financial sponsorship and intelligence training coming from U. S., books, reports, documents and films can all prove it, and the justification was protecting business overseas and stop the rise of new Cubas. To have included bits about South America, giving an extra time, it would qualify for the Oscar in the Documentary, Features category (it was nominated in the short doc).\n\nInstead, we have a summarized view that ignores a couple of things when it shouldn&apos;t. It&apos;s still a very good work, it manages to go back to the hisotry of Latin America before things get a lot more critical than what&apos;d happen decades later. And Ed Asner delivers a great narration of everything. 9/10.",
