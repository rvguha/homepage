These are essentially bike shorts without the seatpad. The material over the spandex is so thin and tight that it leaves nothing to the imagination.  The waist pocket is too flimsy to carry anything of substance without bouncing either.  Also, if you?re a dude, these don?t offer much in the way of relief up front since the spandex is so tight - so long distances are not really an option in these shorts for me. If you like to run in spandex shorts with nothing over them and don?t need to use the pockets, these may be your shorts.",

(Strava says I run about 100 miles a month)\nI found the fit to be just a little tight, I?m a stockier build with bigger hips, if you?re a slimmer individual they?ll probably suite you well.\nThe material is very nice and lightweight. You won?t even notice the outer short is there while running.\nMy main reason for returning them though is the product description is wrong. It says it has 2 font pockets and 1 back pocket, when in reality it just has a very small back waist line pocket. I really like to listen to podcasts while I run and also just like having my phone for emergencies, so shorts that can?t hold a phone are kind of a deal breaker for me.\nFYI, the Patagonia nine trails is so far my favorite running short I?ve found. Highly recommend those.",

I just took a look at multiple of these in the warehouse and can verify that they DO also have the 2 front-hip stretch/stash pockets, as shown in our images. Reach out to our Gearheads if you are interested in giving them another shot!"

I added a star to my rating, as I found with the second wearing and a better pair of socks, they really do fit well. They do not slip and slide on wet grass like my Sloggers do, so that is another plus. However, there is still the problem with getting them on - I have a long handled shoe horn, and that is the only way to get them on. And both times I wore them, my socks are soaking wet. They are loose around the top, and rain poured in the first time, and the second time even the wetness from the grass migrated down to my socks. They are comfortable once on, but not dry on a wet day.",

        "reviewBody": "First, a word of caution: I ordered these in the medium size and thinking that with my small hands and women&apos;s road bike that is all I would need. And, eventually, I have found this to be true. But I was shocked at how small these looked at first. I doubt you have anything to lose by sizing up to a L or XL. I almost wonder why they make these in a medium but I guess without using a large pair I can&apos;t compare them.\n\nThese took some getting used to, even though I sometimes ride with pogies on my flat handlebar fat tire bike. However, once I got used to riding with these, I discovered that they really shine in certain circumstances. First, I must admit I don&apos;t like wearing lobster gloves when riding my drop bar road bike because I learned that I grip the breaks and press the shifters with exactly three fingers. Not two, not four, five is right out. Hence I typically wear a light glove so I can maintain some dexterity. A light glove is not enough for me when temperatures approach freezing. And bike commuting year-round in Wisconsin means there are plenty of sub-freezing days. Once I got used to the mitts, I was comfortable in a pair of light biking gloves down to about 15 degrees, which is when I switch to my fat bike (its disc brakes don&apos;t freeze up like my rim brakes do) and lobster gloves.\n\nTo my great delight, these mitts really, really shine in the wet and cold. I left the mitts at home the first morning I was planning to use them because they weren&apos;t as quick and intuitive to put on as I expected in my pre-coffee morning rush (I also needed the external cable mitts, which have a bit more going on). Biking without them when the temperature was in the 30s and raining, compared to biking with the mitts in the same conditions a week later showed me their worth. My hands froze in less than a mile without the mitts. With the mitts, my hands stayed both warm and dry. The neoprene does a great job of protecting your hands from rain, and the smaller space of the medium mitts traps a lot of heat around my hands. I wear them a lot now so that I can get by with just my lightweight gloves. \n\nAbout a month and a half into using them, I&apos;m getting comfortable moving my hands in and out of the mitts to signal my direction, and installing/removing the mitts from my bike is quick and easy. Though I was initially frustrated with the size (couldn&apos;t return because I had already thrown away the tags in anticipation of how much I would like these) I would highly recommend these for bike commuters or bikers who get their rides in no matter the weather. They get five stars despite the size because they help me continue to enjoy bike commuting. Well done, Bar Mitts.",

        "reviewBody": "I have difficulty with keeping my hands warm.   When I go skiing I need mittens when everyone else is wearing gloves.  Even using heavy winter cycling gloves or &quot;lobster&quot; mittens I was not comfortable in temps below 40F.  \n\nSo this was my latest attempt to find comfort.  Bingo!\n\nThese really to work.  It took about an hour of riding to get accustomed to them but they really are excellent.  One thing.  With them attached to the bike they catch the wind.  You will get blown around a bit.  Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of.  \n\nAnyway, this has solved my Winter riding cold hands problem.",

        "reviewBody": "I did not believe these things were as warm as advertised until I tried them.  I only use these for road rides below 30 F and wear my usual spring gloves (that would usually only be used for spring rides above 50 F).   My coldest so far was 14 F and I used only a medium weight glove and still sweat slightly.  No freezing fingers until I am warmed up any longer!  A little tough to handle in brisk cross winds but not terrible.  I wear a small/medium glove (7.5) and sized up to large for more room to place my hands in quickly.  The larger gap had no effect on warmth.  I can&apos;t imagine using the small. I have had them 3 seasons.  Simple straightforward design in strong material with no durability issues at all as far as I can tell.",

My only negative comment is the magnet for the water hose does not hold the hose, but I am able to keep it in place with other straps.  Overall, I love this pack!!",

I have been using another brand&apos;s hydration pack for hiking and mountain biking but this has immediately taken its place. \r\n\r\nThere is ample room for layers and lunch in this pack. Not to mention the organizational pockets and the out outside bottle pockets that are great for quick access to items or additional beverages. Materials and construction of the bag are great quality and I can tell everything is going to hold up for years to come.\r\n\r\nThis is also my first experience with the Gregory hydration bladder and I have to say it&apos;s much easier to open and operate than my old one. \r\n\r\nThe only negative to the pack is the waist belt does ride up a bit if you&apos;re wearing a shirt made of a slippery fabric. \r\n\r\nAlthough this was a #giftedproduct I would buy it again for myself and my friends!",

Grease will flow out and all over the leg of the stove/floor. Placed a cup in the provided hanging holder but the cup melted quickly. Also, a carrying bag should be standard.",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased the Burton AK 2L Kimmy bibs after having my first bebe. Unfortunately my other pants and bibs from other brands didn&apos;t accommodate my newly wider hips. After reading reviews and seeing other people commenting these were the only bibs that seemed to fit hips, knee braces, athletic or curvy builds, I decided to drop the money on a pair. I am 5&apos;9 and 170 and purchased the size XL. According to the size chart the L would fit, but I wanted plenty of room for playing in the snow in addition to snowboarding. \nThese bibs fully fit the bill. The XL is plenty roomy, but the material and cut is very flattering. Instead of looking too big or baggy, it has enough room for hips and then the legs just look like a nice relaxed fit pant. The hand of the fabric is everything you want in a shell. It is crisp but not stiff and it moves really well. They are pricey, but are fully worth it in my mind. I tend to be of the camp where I spend a bit more money once for the right piece and have it last for years instead of buying ok pieces you have to replace annually.",

I have been wearing mens ski pants since, trouble getting women&apos;s pants over the brace. Finally a pair of pants made for a woman that go comfortably over my knee brace!

I wouldn&apos;t say this was even Euro fit (which tens to run &quot;trim-fit) but more like an Asian L or XL which is another level of trim. If you are into a super-tight fit or looking for a fit that is more akin to what you would find in Japan, Vietnam etc and struggle to find this sizing in North America,  this may work for you. Please consider this before buying something final sale. \n\nOtherwise the quality and build of this jacker is surprisingly nice.",

I originally sized up after reading other reviews but found them a bit large. I went ahead and ordered my normal size (I&apos;m a medium in everything) and they fit me much better.

While it may breathe well, any outdoorsman knows that cotton doesn&apos;t dry quickly, and that is why it is not used in true adventure gear. The only other men&apos;s overalls I could find that use synthetic fibers (that aren&apos;t insulated for winter) are TrueWerk, and that brand insists on printing their obnoxious branding all over their straps as if you&apos;re wearing some sort of fashion underwear. I&apos;m not trying to make a fashion statement when I&apos;m out in the middle of friggin&apos; nowhere. I almost gave up my search until I found these. Flylow really knocked it out of the park. The only thing is that they do run pretty small. I would normally be a medium in just about everything, but in these a large fit perfectly. Other than that these are perfect. I just hope they aren&apos;t a one off thing and Flylow continues to make them. Perhaps I should buy two just in case? I can already tell I&apos;m gonna be wearing these things forever.",

Some people folks thought this bag was too small but this is exactly what I was looking for. Other bags this size have very thin fabric for arm straps - this is much more comfortable for the amount I&apos;m carrying. It&apos;s slightly padded. I love the cord in the front to carry a light jacket. The pockets on the sides are too small for a water bottle (which I never carry on the sides since it can fall out if I bend over in other bags). It matches my duffel too - love it. I&apos;ve been trying to find a mini backpack for hiking, everything I&apos;ve had over the years have been sling bags which get uncomfortable after hours of hiking. So happy to have found this one!",

I’m a 7 1/8 size in hats and while comfortable, I can see why other reviewers may think it fits too snug. It doesn’t bother me but is slightly tighter fitting than other beanies I have. I also did get one very small snag (as another reviewer commented) BUT no one but me would notice. Overall I still feel like the soft fabric, size/depth and style are perfect. I bought the Heather Goat Gray color and really like its warmer gray color. Don’t overthink it and pick one up!",

        "reviewBody": "The replacement tube has been the absolute worst... The tube material is way too soft and it kinks constantly!\n\nThings that have made it kink: \n-Being in a full pack and having some pressure against the bladder. \n-Making a turn from the top of my pack to the hose hole.\n-Making a turn from where it exits my pack to the shoulder strap clip.\n\nI just finished a 3 week hiking trip, and I had to stop and open up my bag to delicately re-arrange the hose repeatedly and just hope that it wouldn&apos;t kink again.\n\nIt was incredibly frustrating! I was already frustrated by the price of the replacement hose, and honestly this experience has destroyed any and all trust I had left in Platypus products. Not sure why they changed the hose material but it was a very bad idea.\n\nThe reason I replaced the hose in the first place was because the lever on the mouthpiece of my original one broke right away. That was some years ago, and I had been using the mouthpiece from some off brand bladder for years since I had to replace it in a pinch and couldn&apos;t get a replacement mouthpiece or hose in store anywhere. I was lucky that some off brand uses the same irregular hose size. It was incredibly inconvenient that I couldn&apos;t just grab a new mouthpiece from REI.\n\nI hope this product team gets their act together someday, but honestly I&apos;m not going to waste my money any more to find out.",

Going to bed at night was boarderline uncomfortable,  but, this bag material really made it feel much better. The reason it is 3star.....Im an average size Man, 5&apos;9&quot; - 210lbs. I am a side sleeper, and toss and turn. This sleeping bag was very tight on my body. There was hardly no extra room inside, even to move my arms to a different position.  I felt pinned down inside it, fully zipped. Maybe this is the design to keep the material close to the body, so the body heat stays in....not sure, but it was uncomfortable at times.",

I bought it based on several reviews I had read especially from bigger guys.  As excited as I was to receive this bag, I was disappointed.  The first thing that happened was one of the zippers on the gills got hung up.  (The bag came with them unzipped). It was so bad I thought I was going to have to call Nemo.  After about an hour I was able to get it unstuck.  Then secondly, I got in the bag to try it out and I couldn’t even zip it up all the way,   I am a big guy, I am 5’8” and weigh 250.  The problem was zipping it up around my shoulders and I am not broad shouldered.  Not sure what I am going to do.  I thought since this bag was a Spoon bag, it would have more room for turning over.  I like the feel of the bag and think it is a quality, just not sure I can use it.",

The only reason my husband would not give them a 5 is the material of the tag is not soft. It&apos;s a plastic fabric that is scratchy and is not easy to remove without damaging the underwear. It is not softening with additional washings. For this reason, we will most likely not be a return customer. Please use a more pliable material for your product labels.",

I paid a lot of extra money to expedite the shipping so I would get them in time, so should have gotten them within a couple of days. I only got an email that they were shipped right after I ordered them, and then I didn&apos;t receive any other updates at all. They did not arrive on time, and now it has been almost a month and I still don&apos;t have them. After spending way too much time contacting support they told me they didn&apos;t know what happened, but it looked like they were lost during shipping. They told me they could refund me or try sending a new pair. I took the refund.",

It fit well around my hips and bust and the overall length was proportional, but I decided to return it because of the collar. It&apos;s very tall! I don&apos;t think I have a short neck, but the collar of the vest hit above my jawline and rubbed my face. I loved the look and fit of the vest otherwise, but the collar would have driven me nuts.",

When I was setting it up the spring somehow bent so it doesn&apos;t engage the drag at all. I&apos;ve reached out to Hardy multiple times over the past few weeks to try and get a replacement spring and have received no response from anyone. I&apos;d love to give this reel a try and would certainly update my review if I get to fish it and it works but for now it&apos;s a very light paperweight on my tying desk. I&apos;m assuming I just received it with a bad spring but I am concerned about durability given this issue before I even had a chance to fish with it.",

For me 2XL was the only choice but even that was too small to fit my lower calf, and I&apos;m not that big a guy. The only way my wife could get the overshoe to fully zip was by pushing the cuff down every time she managed to zip it an inch at a time, essentially needing to bunch most of the top around her upper ankle. The sizing is comically poor. I usually love Castelli products but buyer beware here. Feel bad about burning more diesel fuel to return these rejects but no way would these ever work for us.",

Since my whole frame is broad compared to bust size, it hangs a little less than ideal on me; extra fabric up top. But I&apos;ll take a less than ideal fit in exchange for the utility. It doesn&apos;t look bad either. Bought it on sale, there&apos;s no way I would&apos;ve gambled on it at the absurd full price, but I liked it so well I bought a second. I work in a food truck sometimes, and like to kayak, and this was great for both applications.",

This material is incredible,  its so lightweight and breathable, but durable without being rigid. The green color is wonderful as its visible on the trail, but also so cute! Its better then more khaki, lol\nThe sizing on all  jumpsuits are always a little iffy on me, I usually size up one or two, and then get it altered to fit. It&apos;s worth the extra work, especially for something that will be worn and loved for years to come",

I have two toddlers and this is the year of camping for us. I can already tell I will living in this get up. I’m 5’8, 165 pounds, long torso with big athletic thighs, whose shoulders and DD chest. \n\nThis would be awesome for climbing do to the length and fit of the shorts and also it has a the tell tale extra fabric in the tummy/ crotch area to allow for that. Because of that it’s not the most flattering. I’m 34 and wearing this camping so I don’t care. I will say that I bought the Back Country bra that the model is wearing and it was a no go for me. I think that wearing this with a cuter bra would help the cute factor if that’s what you want.",

        "reviewBody": "Great hiking boots, could be my perfect hiking boot with a few changes. My family of 3 have worn Merrell hiking boots and winter boots for years. The Moab 2 are lightweight, keep your feet dry and warm and give you great traction. The only reason for docking a star is the foot bed. With this last pair, I have noticed that my toes feel so smashed in the upper part of the boot, both in width and length. I’ve worn an 8.5 since I was 16 but I may have to size up for my next pair. I don’t want my hiking boots to run large and feel floppy but these just feel uncomfortable after a a mile or two. I find myself thinking about taking them off which definitely ruins the purpose of my hike. I will possibly try a wide, but again, I don’t want anything to big to cause tripping. Merrell are great boots, this doesn’t make me want to switch brands, but I may have to switch styles to look for a better fit.",

Not only do they appear invisible once you put on a jersey, but they spread the tension so evenly they feel like they&apos;re not even there. Secondly, the flat leg &quot;hem&quot; on these shorts look as good as they feel! If I don&apos;t have to think about the gear I&apos;m wearing, I can focus on my ride and enjoy myself. These bibs do exactly that.\n\nThe only reason I haven&apos;t marked them as a 5-star product is the inseam. A little short for my liking.",

The biggest problem are the seams on the back leg panels are down right abrasive. As a result I experience irritating chaffing and I only wear these out of rotation necessity and on rides less than 30miles. Another annoyance is the leg length is really long and bunches quite a bit.",

My 7-year old Shimano mtb shoes are barely hanging in there(with many questionable repairs). I bought these…despite reviews that alluded to the shoes being at best a normal width. My mistake. They are somehow narrower than my old Shimano’s &amp; totally unacceptable as a ‘wide’ shoe. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU’RE SEARCHING FOR A WIDE SHOE. A quick post-purchase search of my local Craigslist revealed a half dozen pairs of these for sale for the same reason. C’mon Shimano!",

I liked the size and location of the side and hip pockets as they allow you to reach for water or snacks without stopping. The front hip belt straps were a little long and bounced against my legs but I just tied knots into them to shorten them. The brain was roomy and easy to access and let me get to things without digging all the way into the pack.",

When I follow the directions to fit the XS pack, the hip belt sits above my hips, around my waist.\nWhen I fit the M/L pack, it is too large overall, with gaps between me and the shoulder straps. I purchased both sizes and had to return both. I will be buying a different brand of pack that fits me properly.",

I never get blisters on my feet so can&apos;t speak to any of the other reviews. I&apos;ve found the shoes to be comfy from the first time wearing and are still very comfy after all the wear and remain so for a long day of walking, lifting timbers and climbing on framing.

Both boots have eyelets for the laces and NO hooks, so getting them off and on in unnecessarily difficult, seems like a pretty poor design for no good reason.

Sadly these have to go back, as the cons are too much to overcome. Such a near miss. Pros: -Super cushiony insoles -Wider toe box -Nice looking -Seem very Grippy Cons: -Hard to get foot in due to attached tongue - I have narrow feet and I had to really work to get my feet in. My husband tried to get them on and couldn&apos;t - he has average sized feet. -They sort of curve in and rub aggressively at the ankles. Blisters guaranteed and I don&apos;t think breaking them in would help. Just walking around the house was uncomfortable. -Not breathable - feet were sweaty just wearing them around the house on a cold day, and I&apos;m a cold natured person who doesn&apos;t sweat much.

Now the seam at the top where the thermal material meets the rubber material use to hold the warmer in place has come apart. Castelli use to be a premium brand; what happened? Now they&apos;re too old to return(just over a month old, worn one time) even tho they&apos;re defective... I guess i will need to call the manufacture for a replacement.",

XXL is weirdly way smaller than XXL, I do not understand it.  XXL fits but has a snug fit throughout similar to Kuhl but the body/torso is longer (I&apos;m tall so Kuhl eventually gets too short for me); hopefully these Patagonia&apos;s won&apos;t shrink as bad.",

I&apos;m in Texas and it&apos;s the perfect level of warmth to throw in your car for the 4 months of the year where its in the 40s- 50&apos;s.  I also took it over to London at the beginning of April and found that it was perfect... as long as it wasn&apos;t raining, but it is what it is.  It&apos;s a little longer and loser than the same version by Arc&apos;teryx, so it can go over more layers if needed.  It&apos;s best for around town or by a campfire, it&apos;s not the most technical, but it&apos;s also not trying to be.   I&apos;m a muscular 5&apos;8&quot; and run 220- 225, I went with the large and it&apos;s perfect.",

Having purchase Patagonia products for many years I knew I could count on the design and craftsmanship of this solid company. I was not disappointed. This sweater is warm and offers the freedom of movement I need while hiking through some rough forrest country.\nThe delivery of my sweater was swift and efficient with the marriage of DHL and the USPS system offered by Back Country. Even on a Sunday, your staff got the ball rolling in processing my order. The fit is right on target in a large for my 185 Lb frame.  A win win experience. Thanks gear heads!",

I use them for layering for skiing, pullover for chilly mornings in the house, impersonating a French mountain guide, very very useful, and very svelte.  I buy these every year as Christmas gifts for the guys in the family.  Piece of advice, shave before wearing, reduces pilling of the fleece around the neck, as fleece and sandpaper don?t mix, apparently.  Fit is true to size, although larger necks (like mine) will find the fit snug, but not a problem.  I give this item my highest recommendation.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the prior version of this jacket in Real Tree Hardwoods in 2016 and used it to harvest my first turkey. That jacket lasted 7 hunting seasons (spring and fall) and is still usable but the camo is fading so I bought this jacket as a replacement. I used it the first time for deer this fall.\n\nThis jacket appears just as durable as my 2016 jacket, but appears to also have water resistance features as an added bonus. With a wool base layer and long sleeve T underneath, the jacket should be ok for a long sit down to 45 degrees.  For colder weather, just add a down vest. This is probably a roomy medium. I&apos;m a true medium (5&apos;10&quot;, 160lbs) and the medium in this jacket gives you room to layer, but it&apos;s not so big as to let wind come up the waist elastic.\n\nI own quite a bit of hunting clothes from some big name competitors, but Carhartt has always been my favorite go-to. My only suggestion for improvement is for Carhartt to expand the line. Make Yukon Extremes in hunting pattern! Expand the types of camo patterns. Build it and they will come.",

Also, I&apos;ve read a few reviews about how some do not like how the zipper goes up too high, but that really isn&apos;t a problem. In fact, I&apos;m heavy wind or extremely cold weather, I see it as a plus because you can close up more, but if it is uncomfortable just don&apos;t zip all the way way up (common sense).",
