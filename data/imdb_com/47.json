      "reviewBody": "Alexandre Aja is now a well-known name after his success in the horror genre with &quot;Haute Tension&quot; and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;. In &quot;Furia&quot;, his first feature length film, he tells a story loosely based on &quot;Graffiti&quot;, a short story written by Argentinian writer Julio Cortazar. While the film is definitely not perfect, it is very good for a debut, and one can witness how Aja&apos;s art has grown up to the point where he is now.\n\nBoth the story and the film have as setting, a city where freedom of speech is nearly outlawed. Sure, people can still travel and make business with freedom, but it is forbidden to express ideas and to paint on the walls is a serious crime. This is the world where Theo (Stanislas Merhar) lives, and where he paints.\n\nEven with this scenario perfect for a high sci-fi tale, the short-story (and in consequence, the movie too) focuses on the people rather than on the setting. Theo paints, but he only does it because he likes it, without a serious political theme in his graffiti. Until Elia (Marion Cotillard) enters in his life and gives meaning and substance to his, until that point, simple and untroubled life. This event also awakes him and the change is reflected in his drawings, as he discovers that Elia too likes to paint at night.\n\nWhile the short story remains focused on Theo and how love changed his life; Aja takes some time to explore this decadent world although, without deviating too far away from his subject. This has as result a very human movie, and a very interesting concept that never gets boring or tiresome.\n\nEven in this early movie, Aja&apos;s great use of colors is already noticeable; and his visual composition is not only very good for his limited budget, it is also fitting for the theme and mood of the story. Of course, the movie has technical flaws, particularly the lighting is a bit bad at times. Nevertheless, one can see that Aja&apos;s style was developing at that time.\n\nThe cast is very good, and Merhar and Cotillard have lots of chemistry on screen. Marion Cotillard is really someone who captures the attention, not only for her beauty, but also for her ability to transmit emotions. Wadeck Stanczak is also superb as Theo&apos;s brother who works for the government even when he knows they oppress people. He has very good scenes and really owns the screen when he is in it.\n\n&quot;Furia&quot; is a very interesting film, not only for its subject matter, but also because it serves as testimony of the growth of a young filmmaker that with only three films is already a promising star of modern cinema. 7/10",

It should have contained some good songs. The story, screen play, dialogs, action and all other things are well executed. From me, if you are a Sunil Shetty fan or a fan of action movies, watch this movie and then vote. Seven plus is a surety from me. Makrand Deshpandey was also excellent in the movie.",

There was a backlash, of course, as people like Anita Bryant led a charge against gays and lesbians.\n\nHomosexuality may no longer be a mental illness, but with Bryant, Ronald Reagan, and Jerry Falwell in the public limelight, it became a sin.

Mann&apos;s films were the more prestigious, usually featuring James Stewart who, with John Wayne, was the fifties&apos; biggest box-office draw... &quot;The Man From Laramie&quot; best known because of the Frankie Laine theme strong which accompanied it, is notable for (among other things) Alex Nicol&apos;s extraordinary projection of sadism, an element which dominated the best of Mann&apos;s movies... The motion picture was to be the last of the Mann-Stewart Westerns...\n\nStewart is cast as a wagon handler from Laramie, Wyoming, but is, really, an army officer out to avenge the death of his younger brother, a U.S. Cavalryman, massacred by the Apaches who were buying guns from unknown persons... It is these persons that Stewart is looking for..\n\nSoon Stewart gets involved in an area of New Mexico which is ruled by the iron hand of a cattle baron Donald Crisp, a strong authoritarian &quot;who can&apos;t live with a lie&quot;... Crisp&apos;s one weakness is his love and care for his spoiled son, Alex Nicol... \n\nWild but feeble, yet vicious, Nicol - with extraordinary projection of sadism - accosts Stewart in several confrontations in which (among other outrages) Stewart is dragged through fire by horses, and has his hand held tight while Alex puts a bullet through it... Mann proceeds in this mood throughout the movie, growing even more sadistic...\n\nArthur Kennedy, a hard-working heavy, plays the adopted son of Crisp... He is a son in disguise, jealous of Alex, pretending to be his brother&apos;s ally and protector...\n\nA lot of good supporting actors are cast including Cathy O&apos;Donnell, the fragile beauty who has little to do but await patiently for an opportunity; Aline MacMahon, the fine &apos;ugly&apos; woman who never leaves the old man, and Jack Elam who tries to knife James Stewart in the back... \n\nAnthony Mann adopted an altogether tougher approach to Western mythology than John Ford... His obsessive, neurotic characters and his emphasis on violence foretell the work of Peckinpah, Leone and Eastwood...\n\nFilmed in Technicolor, &quot;The Man From Laramie&quot; is a Western with new touches of brutality touching off the wide screen spectacle...",

      "description": "Anthony Mann&apos;s psychological revenge saga of Shakespearean proportions starring James Stewart\n\nHeld by many to be the pinnacle of the five Westerns they were teamed on, The Man from Laramie marked the final collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart.\n \nStewart stars as a resolute vigilante, obsessed with finding the man responsible for his brother&apos;s death. Among the suspects are an arrogant cattle baron (Donald Crisp), his sadistic son (Alex Nicol) and his ranch foreman (Arthur Kennedy).\n \nA psychological revenge saga of Shakespearean proportions, and masterfully filmed in Cinemascope and Technicolor, The Man from Laramie is one of the most powerful dramas of the 1950s. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present it in a new 4K restoration in a Dual-Format edition for the first time in the UK.",

      "name": "Strange Adventure - indeed!",
      "reviewBody": "In 1944 Wolfgang Staudte shot a film called &quot;The Man, Who Had His Name Stolen&quot;. It was finished, but didn&apos;t pass the censorship and parts of it were lost in the war. After the success of the first post-war German film, &quot;The Murderers Are Among Us&quot;, Staudte once again undertook to film the story he had tackled in 1944. As he used many of the same actors, it is believed that parts of the 1944 film were used, and other sequences re-shot with different actors three years later. &quot;The Strange Adventure of Mr Fridolin B&quot; was finally released in March 1948.\n\nIt was a year of some of the strangest films of the 40s in Germany. Staudte released &quot;The Strange Adventure...&quot;, which is a well constructed, witty dry comedy about two men with identical names, who for some strange reason have been listed by the official bureaucracy as one. So they obviously have to share each-others fate to some extent. Helmut Käutner released &quot;The Apple Fell&quot;, another allegorical fairy-tale with very similar, claustrophobic atmosphere where the bureaucrat is God, toying around with small people. These two films are very similar in style and feeling, and both are very well crafted, shot and edited.\n\nNevertheless, Staudte&apos;s film didn&apos;t meet with acclaim at the time. It was a period when &quot;Trümmerfilme&quot; (&quot;Ruin films&quot;) were all the rage and films of individual and national guilt and responsibility (such as Staudte&apos;s next, &quot;Rotation&quot;) made headlines. Comedies which grazed the screen were becoming hysterically optimistic, which was the trend of the nearing 1950s.\n\nBoth Staudte&apos;s and Käutner&apos;s films are as far from the real world as a film can be, creating a strange parallel universe within the familiar framework of our everyday lives. This kind of extreme escapism was quite popular during the War, but obviously it became outdated as the political system changed radically. It&apos;s hard to tell why the first version of &quot;Fridolin B&quot; was banned by the Nazzi officials as the film is now lost. But as it stands, the 1948 version is lost somewhere in no-man&apos;s-land, and obviously confused the viewer of that era.\n\nStill, seeing it today is a pleasure. The Kafkan Angst combined with the utterly ridiculous storyline makes a tense, yet gleeful viewing. The fact that you are watching a film which crosses all the imaginable borders - partially filmed during the Nazi regime, partially by the Soviet-controlled DEFA - only adds to the surreal pleasure.",

      "reviewBody": "Showing in local theaters only now, this 2009 film has been re-titled as &quot;Revenge of the College Ghost.&quot; From that cheesy awkward title and the awful poster of zombie-like ghosts, you knew instantly this was definitely going to be a B-horror flick. And surely enough, you get exactly what you imagined.\n\nLet&apos;s pick on the new title. First, there is &quot;Revenge&quot;. A mistreated girl Angela seeks revenge on the kids who were cruel to her. Of course, these kids die one by one in all sorts of violent gory ways. Then there is &quot;College.&quot; This is a teen horror flick. But the kids here were high school graduates, just about to go to college. And then there&apos;s &quot;Ghost.&quot; Angela&apos;s ghost was awakened during a juvenile spirit-summoning game the teens played in a cemetery, and she wastes no time to exact her revenge.\n\nThe only aspect I liked in the story is how after each character was killed, he or she was somehow erased from everyone else&apos;s memory (except for the lead character Sandy, who used to be Angela&apos;s best friend). This of course made poor Sandy look like a raving lunatic to the people around her. Aside from that though, everything else was run of the mill teen horror, from the sexy girls to the gory deaths. The actors were all unknown, generic and acted in a campy manner. The ghosts were portrayed in the style of Sadako in &quot;The Ring&quot; with jerky movements, only here they acted like they were in the &quot;Thriller&quot; video. Maybe good for a temporary shallow thrill. Do not expect too much.",

On November 25th 1945, Muzard, also the director of the popular magazine &quot;Ciné-Mondial&quot; was condemned to 3 years imprisonment. Jean Marquès-Rivière, who had fled France, was condemned to death, to National degradation (loss civil rights as a French citizen); all his assets were also confiscated. Director, Jean Mamy (a.k.a Paul Riche), a journalist at the French nazi newspaper &quot;Au pilori&quot; and a fierce anti-semite was also condemned to death. He was shot by a firing squad at the Montrouge fortress on March 29th 1949."

They rescue a maiden in distress (played by Simone Blondell, the daughter of director Fidani) and happily kill everybody who looks like a bandit.\n\nTruly no art, but still the best movie by the director, as far as I&apos;ve seen his works... which reviewers often describe as &quot;junk&quot;. The screenplay is straight ahead, the music by Lallo Gori provides tension and a good title song, and the camera work of Joe D&apos;Amato is excellent with its many close-ups and precise focusing. Kinski puts more effort in his performance than in some other westerns, for example in the scene at the beginning when he discovers his two brothers were killed. Ray Saunders got a really nice role as a former slave saved by Nevada Kid. In a scene which was cut from the 80s video tape version but restored for DVD, he even sings a song. Hunt Powers is first mentioned in the cast, but plays only one of the bandits.",

It&apos;s obvious that these are all deliberate choices; the question is, would we care if it didn&apos;t have the name Agnès Varda on it? \n\nUltimately, the film&apos;s amateurish style is somewhat deceptive: Varda demonstrates her talent for finding significance in the mundane, and strikes a number of compelling parallels in her examination of scavenger culture. The film does tend to coast on Varda&apos;s legendary new wave status at times, particularly as we linger on interviews and segments only tenuously related to the film&apos;s subject, but it&apos;s interesting as an example of a living legend embracing her medium&apos;s democratization: for all the good and bad it implies, she blends in seamlessly with the millions of talented people who own camcorders. -TK 10/21/10"

      "reviewBody": "I should confess at the start: I don&apos;t speak Japanese. This means that I likely missed many of the nuances and meanings beneath the words spoken by the characters in this play- not to mention the subtitles going by at times at a quick clip- and I may have missed a couple of the jokes that appeared to get big laughs or the significance of some of the Noh stylistics. But as an ardent fan of Takashi Miike, and his body of work that may not be the best of Japanese film (Kurosawa or Ozu or Kobayashi would be the one of three good choices), but certainly has the widest range of any director; picking out something of his to watch, however sometimes familiar and derivative, is like picking out something from a menu at a reputable restaurant. Not everything is perfect, but usually you get a very good meal.\n\nDemon Pond is no exception, only now there&apos;s the distinction of it being live, video-taped theater, with Miike directing both the camera-work and editing as well as the actors on stage. The play is about a pond, of the title, and the principle character Yamazawa, Hagawara, and Yuri. There is a bell right next to where Yuri lives, and it must be rung three times or else there will be dire consequences. But there&apos;s also a drought going on in the nearby village from a lack of the river from the pond. There&apos;s also curses to be had, and an irate princess who can&apos;t stand that the bell is rung as it keeps here from her one true love and wants to cut it down. There are some other things that happen- one of which in the last act that would be a terrible spoiler- but suffice to say it&apos;s surrounded in fable and mythological lore, the likes of which will be more familiar to the students and fans of Japanese mythology and stories.\n\nIn fact, one of the joys of Demon Pond is storytelling, as sometimes a character will prove himself by telling a story, as one does for Yuri to possibly get a place to sleep for the night. It&apos;s also a plus that, for much of the time, the humor is genuine and I found myself laughing along with the audience at both the absurd little beats in the script and the exaggerated performances by the supporting players (while my least favorite section of the play, the mid-section with the men with their catch of fish, there are plenty of crazy laughs). Here and there the story might be a little tough to follow, as characters go on and on about things that don&apos;t have much to do with the central plot. When it does work, however, it&apos;s a splendid synthesis of superb &apos;stylized&apos; acting (i.e. the princess), production design and flamboyant costume designs, and sweet and somber music. There are even one or two fairly quotable lines, like &quot;Don&apos;t scream &apos;Tokyo&apos; at me in anger&quot;, or &quot;I like Veggie, but don&apos;t call me Mr. Veggie!&quot; \n\nSo, congratulations to Mr. Miike, as he&apos;s somehow pulled off some very good and fascinating direction on a good fantasy play/video, even if, sad to say, I&apos;d still much rather see how he&apos;d do it as a real film: now *there* would be something incredible. And, as another note of interest for Americans, I happen to find the DVD as something of an anomaly at my local Blockbuster. 7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Purple Storm&quot; is actually a great action movie, well worthy a watch if you like high octane action movies that have a good plot as well.\n\nThe story is about Todd Nguyen who is a terrorist but having suffered head trauma has lost his memory and is now being played as an undercover agent by the ATF (Anti Terrorist Force) in Hong Kong, trying to unravel a terrorist cell and hinder their action to set off a cataclysmic event known as &quot;Purple Storm&quot; (though referred to a Purple Rain in the movie). Todd gradually recovers his lost memories but finds himself torn between the righteousness and good of humanity and between his ties to family and the terrorist organization.\n\nThe people cast for &quot;Purple Storm&quot; were doing great jobs with their roles, and I must admit that even though I don&apos;t like Daniel Wu one bit, then his performance in this movie was actually quite good and convincing. But he didn&apos;t carry the movie alone, there was another crucial performance by the guy who played the leader of the terrorist cell, he really put on a great performance.\n\n&quot;Purple Storm&quot; has a lot of action, in form of gunfights, fight scenes and chase scenes, and it was all nicely executed and choreographed, coming together for a great entertainment experience.\n\nI liked the storyline in the movie, despite it not being innovative or introducing anything new to this particular genre of action movies. But also my love for Asian cinema helped to enjoy this movie for what it was. Great action. Great fun. Great performances. Great story.\n\nIf you enjoy Hong Kong cinema and like an adrenaline-filled action thriller, then you should treat yourself to &quot;Purple Storm&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Giovanni Pastrone&apos;s grand-scale storytelling of a lost princess, her journey from being kidnapped to almost being offered as a child sacrifice and then ending up as a slave, &apos;Cabiria&apos; is cinema&apos;s first true epic. Pastrone made several films, and the scope and spectacle of his films inspired directors like Griffith and Fellini, but &apos;Cabiria&apos; is the only one which has stood the test of time. And since the story is set almost 2000 years ago, the aged quality of this 100-year-old film only adds to the feel of the time.\n\nLike Griffith&apos;s &apos;Birth of a Nation&apos;, &apos;Cabiria&apos; too was shrouded in controversy for its biased depiction of races, places and cultures. Like &apos;Birth of a Nation&apos; propagated Ku Klux Klan&apos;s nobility and agenda, &apos;Cabiria&apos; tried to legitimize Italy&apos;s distant past, and tried to promote and inspire themes like &apos;wars of conquest&apos;, Roman salute, racial nobility and virtue, etc. I mean, all the non-Roman characters in the film are depicted in negative light.\n\nWhatever the controversial history the movie might have, if one is ready to ignore those aspects and try to acknowledge the feat it tries to achieve in the medium of filmmaking, it&apos;s an enjoyable journey. The movie offers many fascinating sequences, like, the child offerings at Temple of Moloch, Princess Sophonisba&apos;s pet leopard and even her spectacular arrival for her almost wedding, soldiers and elephants crossing the Alps, the pyramid formed by soldiers and shields in one continuous shot, and few others.\n\nThe original version is said to have been three hours long. I saw the truncated 1993 restoration, which is two hours long. In this itself, the number of characters and events seem too many, a few of them almost unnecessary; I wonder what the extra 60 minutes had in store. Better editing (I mean, even shorter than two hours) could have made the story tighter, more interesting and compelling.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s an interesting story and a well-made film, and personally, I liked it much more than the overrated &apos;Ben-Hur&apos;.",

And yes, that is as stupid as it sounds. It&apos;s not even an enjoyably bad movie. It&apos;s dull, boring and totally not worth your time. I actually got this on one of those multiple DVD sets where they put 4 movies onto the same disc, or two discs in this case, and because you want to see one of them you wind up seeing all four just to see how bad they are. And trust me. They&apos;re bad.\n\nSo yeah there is no reason to see this movie even out of morbid fascination. It&apos;s just not worth it.",

I don&apos;t understand why this movie is rated so low, I think it should be at least a 7. Since it&apos;s way low-voted, I just give a ten to hopefully raise the points. \n\nThis movie is a very unusual creation, a bit experimental but on an audience-friendly way. The dialogs were my favorites, they are very raw, very real life and absolutely hilarious. I guess most of those who voted it down must have not really understand this kind a humour. For me it was a bit British-humour-like, but still somewhat different. I would give an award for the creators, because this crazy and daring-kind a movie making were not present in Hungarian film making this far. Keep up the good work, guys!",

The movie was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well. The things he says and does is just how I would imagine a person with too much money to act. The movie is much funnier than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks. Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas which is you can&apos;t buy love with money.",

      "reviewBody": "The point of this documentary: Arabs, Palestinians, and Muslims are unfairly portrayed in cinema. Sure. I believe that. But so are most minorities. Everybody knows this.\n\nThere are many, many flaws in this documentary. First, it assumes that we are stupid, and that we believe everything Hollywood tells us. Wrong. I am friends with quite a few Muslims, and I don&apos;t think they&apos;re terrorists. Nor do I watch many movies with Arab stereotypes. In fact, of all the movies cited in the documentary, I&apos;ve only seen &quot;Aladdin.&quot; And when I do see stereotypes, I can differentiate them from real life. This documentary even gives existing examples of positive Arab portrayals in films like &quot;Syriana,&quot; &quot;Three Kings,&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of Heaven.&quot; Gee, how groundbreaking. If Shaheen can find the good Arab roles, then any movie audience can, too. And they can recognize them.\n\nSecondly, this documentary poorly made. &quot;Reel Bad Arabs&quot; is, as another reviewer said, a talking head giving examples. And it&apos;s only one talking head. Any work of nonfiction, whether it be a documentary or a news article or a book, cannot survive on one expert opinion alone. And this documentary definitely doesn&apos;t. The narrator, Jack Shaheen doesn&apos;t even have screen presence. This documentary is just 50 minutes of him whining into a camera in an effort to advertise his book on the same subject.\n\nThirdly, this movie is unnecessary. Here&apos;s the basic point: Some movies stereotype Arabs, but there are also some movies that don&apos;t. What Jack Shaheen should have done was just to give us a list of the &quot;bad&quot; movies and a list of the &quot;good&quot; movies and leave it at that. That would have taken two minutes at most, instead of this fifty-minute run-on. We would have been able to figure out what the stereotypes were (once again, we&apos;re not stupid), and that the good portrayals were the ones where Arabs acted like actual human beings.\n\nP.S. Did anyone else notice how Shaheen used the original line from &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (Aladdin)--&quot;Where they cut off your ear/ If they don&apos;t like your face&quot;--when nobody sees that version anymore? All video released use the line: &quot;Where it&apos;s flat and immense/ And the heat is intense.&quot; That controversy was closed off long ago and is now irrelevant. Like the rest of this documentary.",

That bottle could have been sent from every part of this planet: that&apos;s what we call &quot;globalisation&quot; . &quot;Modern slavery&quot; is a fashion enjoyed all over the world.

      "reviewBody": "Thunderball is the fourth entry in the ever ongoing James Bond franchise and in my opinion one of the better installments. This film features the secret services arch-enemy SPECTRE and I must say that in this episode of James Bond adventures it works better than in From Russia with Love. What I liked about this film, was that there were a lot of good one-liners from Connery, that there weren&apos;t too many goofy stunts / henchmen / gadgets and that the film was able to maintain exciting throughout. I&apos;ve read quite a few comments stating that the underwater scenes dragged on too long, but I must say that I felt even that bit to be quite entertaining and thrilling. I actually have only one criticism and that regards the ending. I felt that the whole out-of-control boat thing was really stupid. I mean I understand that they tried to make it look spectacular, but in using the same technique they used to buff up the fistfights, they made it look cheesy and cheap. Luckily this is just one short moment in the film and the film is not ruined by something as a dreadful character or a bad actor. All in all this is one of the better Bond films and well worth watching if one sets out for 2 hours of pure adventurous entertainment with a standard-formula story.\n\n7 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "During a phase of my life, I had a roommate who had used to sing &quot;Ai malik tere bande hum&quot; (O Lord, we&apos;re thy servants!) pretty often, and that was the only reason I watched this movie (the song was from this movie, he had told me!), when it was broadcast by Dordarshan, the National Television Channel of India, a few years later. And I must admit, it was a good movie. Sure, it had all those mandatory songs, but yet the songs didn&apos;t intrude into the movie, at least for an Indian such as I, used to heavy and endless dose of songs in movies.\n\nTo me, the most impressive point of this movie was its simple yet nice story (apparently based on a real-life incident), which was devoid of many so-called masalas (spices!)in spite of the era in which it was made (Compare Do Bigha Zamin for cheap sentimentality, for example) and yet executed well.\n\nIt&apos;s long-enduring impact can be seen from the spoof enacted by Annu Kapoor for a T.V. series (I don&apos;t remember its name, though) which used to be in Zee TV as recently as in 2003."

      "reviewBody": "The problem with shark films is that, once you hear about it, people immediately think of Steven Spielberg&apos;s masterpiece Jaws. So how do you approach a shark film without repeating Jaws? The answer is Deep Blue Sea. \n\nResearchers and scientists harvest brain fluids from sharks for a cure for Alzheimer&apos;s disease, but unknown to the other scientists, Dr. Susan McAlester(Saffron Burrows) and Dr. Jim Whitlock(Stellan Skarsgard) violated the code of ethics and genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, with the side effect of the sharks getting smarter and bigger. \n\nIn a genre full of clichés, this film at least keeps you guessing here and there. What director Renny Harlin establishes is that anyone can die, the whole cast is expendable, and ultimately fodder. However, in doing so he at least allows you to get to know the characters before they&apos;re shark food, some more than others. One can understand why Dr. McAlester is so driven for a cure, but ultimately it&apos;s all her fault for the events that take place in the film. Thomas Jane is good in the role Carter Blake, who is a shark wrangler. He also somehow magically dodges every shark that comes towards him and rides on their fins like Aquaman. Almost unrealistic, but the movie is so fun you just kinda go along with it and Jane handles the actions scenes quite well. Plus he holds his breath under water like no human can which can be impressive, but again a bit of a stretch. LL Cool J and Michael Rapaport provide sharp wisecracks and provide the film&apos;s humor. Samuel L. Jackson also has a decent supporting role as Russell Frankin, the research team&apos;s financial backer.\n\nThe shark deaths are brutal and unforgiving and may make some uneasy. The problem with this film is that, although the shark attacks are effective, it tries a lot to make you uncomfortable and it becomes too one-noted. Of course in a film like this it&apos;s expected. The whole time you have no idea who is going to die next, and those sharks are relentless and a lot more vicious. Director Renny Harlin effectively uses the timing, suspense and the element of surprise so kudos to him. The shark puppets look great, but the same cannot be said for the cgi shark effects, it&apos;s dated and doesn&apos;t hold up. \n\nDeep Blue Sea is pure popcorn entertainment. The film doesn&apos;t necessarily bring anything new to the table, but again it keeps you guessing and at times it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It&apos;s an effective shark film, and it tires to be a good film. That&apos;s something I can appreciate. \n\n6.5/10",

I saw this movie for the second time when I was in the US Army, and it turned me off. I couldn&apos;t believe guys were measuring their chances of getting off the line by hoping for the million dollar wound, or some other malady. The third time I saw this movie, I had grown up and realized that, human nature being what it is, nothing about their behavior was abnormal. While I was growing up, Van Johnson was the model GI in all of his movies, as he is in this. I liked the entire cast in this movie. I think one of the best scenes was the Christmas gathering with the Chaplin. His &quot;Was this trip necessary?&quot; speech was one of the high points of the movie for me then and now. This movie, along with &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; are a must see.",

He lives in the shadow of his older brother and desperately wants to make a change in his life. Actually, being in his position, everyone would want that - unsuccessful marriage, bad childhood and now - no professional success...\n\nIn the first scene we see Adas in the morgue. It is then, when he takes us on a tour through his sad life.\n\nThe movie title (&quot;Nothing funny&quot;) is a bit ironic. Adas&apos; life is full of hilarious events, yet for him this is not as funny, as for a third person. The picture is enjoyable to watch, yet one would need some insight into the reality of Poland in the very early 1990&apos;s to understand all the jokes.\n\nAbove all remember: this is not how real life in Poland looks :D"

One semester yesterday later (hey, that&apos;s what the title card said) a new sociology professor is at the school. She makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there, and starts dating another professor. The students are all bored, as are we.\n\nThere are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed. Scenes are pretty short, and cut to different characters somewhere else, making for little progression of any kind. A lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and serve little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing. Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there? And also, at least one of the dead people don&apos;t seem to have been missed by others.\n\nThe killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast, another by stabbing him in the crotch, and another by slicing her forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something?\n\nThe video box cover has a cheerleader: there aren&apos;t any in the movie. The rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but nobody ever wears such an outfit, and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one-on-one.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on the excellent novel by renowned science fiction author H.G. Wells, this watchable and updated remake of the 1933 film starring Charles Laughton plays on the Frankenstein theme where man attempts to play God and improve upon Mother Nature. Andrew Braddock (Michael York) is a castaway of a shipwreck who serendipitously lands on an isolated island in the Pacific, and becomes the guest of the main inhabitant, Dr Moreau who appears seemingly hospitable enough at first. His other companions are ex-mercenary Montgomery (Nigel Davenport), and a beautiful yet emotionally distant woman Maria (Barbara Carrera),whom the doctor claims to have rescued from poverty from another country and brought up as his ward. Braddock&apos;s stay is normal albeit boring at first (not really much to do on an isolated island, is there?), then he begins to notice that things are not what they seem - the strange animal sounds that emanate from the forest at night, and the weird facial features of the servants who wait upon the doctor. His worst fears are confirmed when he encounters the results of the doctor&apos;s experiments - upright hairy creatures (who look like variations of the Wolfman of the old horror movies) that appear human and yet are not exactly men, though they wear clothing and can speak. He realizes that Dr Moreau is a madman doing modern Frankenstein-type experiments by messing up with the DNA of humans and animals, with Montgomery as a contemporary Igor - how the doctor obtains and maintains sterility of his concoctions and instruments without the benefit of refrigeration or sterilization in such primitive conditions is a moot point.\n\nWhen Braddock protests at the cruel treatment of the creatures, Dr Moreau attempts to justify his experiments by explaining that by doing so, humanity would be benefited by elimination of birth defects and such, but Braddock is unconvinced.\n\nThough they are repulsive-looking in appearance, the viewer can&apos;t help but sympathize with the plight of the &quot;manimals&quot;, who live together in squalor in a dark cave, kept in line by The Laws established by Moreau - do not kill, do not shed blood, do not walk on all fours, etc. - repeated on an almost daily basis by their apparent leader the Sayer of the Law (Richard Baseheart), who looks the most &quot;human&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; of the lot. Infractions of the Law results in being brought to the so-called House of Pain, where Moreau attempts to &quot;correct&quot; the miscreant and remind him that he is human and not animal.\n\nThe turning point in the film is when the Bullman (obviously originally a bison by the presence of a hairy hump on his back), having broken the law of shedding blood, attempts to flee rather than face punishment and is gunned down by Braddock. Yet despite having broken the law against killing, Braddock goes apparently unpunished, establishing in the minds of the other man-beasts of the unfairness of the Law - they seem to ask silently, why can this man kill and go scot-free and we can&apos;t?, and the eventual murder of Montgomery at the hands of Dr Moreau himself reinforces the double-standards of The Law in their eyes, and they eventually rise and revolt against the doctor, killing him, destroying the compound in which he lives in and setting it on fire. Ironically, it is this very act of staging a collective uprising which brings out the &quot;humanity&quot; of the creatures, as it shows that they can after all, think and plan and not merely act on their basic instincts, as the scenes where they suspend the doctor on a rope and systematically destroy the House of Pain and release the captive animals show. So in a way, Dr Moreau&apos;s experiments were not a total failure as he thought, they just didn&apos;t turn out the way he anticipated.",

      "reviewBody": "I was forced to wait 6 months between watching &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and getting an opportunity to watch this &quot;sequel&quot; (shot at the same time) and it was agony, though I was somewhat afraid that the second one would not live up to its predecessor.  I am glad to say that I was completely wrong and that this one more than lives up to its companion.  The action is just as fast and the characters as endearing (because, as we learn, only Porthos could find &quot;a new way to disarm himself&quot; - and then make it work when it counted!)  But comedy aside (such as our heroes eating breakfast in the middle of a battle), the serious turns that had to be taken in order to stay true to Dumas&apos; novel were very well done also.  Oliver Reed imparts his loathing for Milady DeWinter not only with his words, but also with the expression in his [gorgeous] eyes and when he holds her at gunpoint in order to get the Cardinal&apos;s warrant, several seconds go by in which you as a viewer actually believe that he will kill her right there in cold blood. In fact, Reed is, in my opinion, truly the star of this picture as his character of Athos attempts to mentor young D&apos;Artangan and prevent him from being hurt.  Michael York is, as usual, wide-eyed and very courageous and Finlay and Chamberlain continue to be terrific fops but it is Reed that carries them through.  Kudos also have to go to Faye Dunaway as Milady - she is truly evil and charming at the same time and you can see how her character manages to be so good at what she does. I encourage everyone to see this movie - especially as a companion to &quot;The Three Musketeer&quot; - and support those in favor of having an edited-together three hour version. It is truly a classic.  (And side note to my fellow students - if you don&apos;t have time to read the book &quot;The Three Musketeers,&quot; rent these two movies and you&apos;ll get the gist of what you need to know.)"

The first concerns a famous scientist who is trying to get his equally famous son to commit suicide because only in tragic death is true immortality achieved. The second story is about two men who linger endlessly (and I mean endlessly) about a prostitute they both love, who herself gives seven-hour monologues about the very nature of wallpaper (maybe I wasn&apos;t paying very close attention by that point). The third installment, about an unhappy woman in a peasant village who seeks out the help of a Greek hermitic witch and learns a lesson about dissatisfaction, is by far the most interesting tale and the only one that is actually a story as opposed to an acting exercise for melodramatic orators."

There&apos;s that very freaky story and a wrecked Bonham-Carter (she&apos;s good playin such characters ;-) adding most to this film. However the ending was a little too fantastic since it shouldn&apos;t be a problem for the forensics to ... no, I won&apos;t spoil hehe.\n\nMy favourite scene was Martin&apos;s call where he spoke to that guy who answered the phone with &quot;barbie&apos;s bakery. it&apos;s mr. muffin man speakin.&quot; LOL\n\nMy overall rating is: 6.5/10 - if you&apos;re not sure what to watch, try this one. It works pretty well as entertainment."

      "reviewBody": "Silent screen star Ramon Novarro teams up with Jeanette MacDonald in &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle,&quot; a 1934 musical film. The film also stars Jean Hersholt, Frank Morgan, and Vivienne Segal.\n\nThe story concerns two songwriters, one from a classical background, Victor Florescu (Novarro, and one assumes from that last name, he&apos;s from Roumania), and Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald) a young woman from a popular songwriting background who meet. He falls madly in love with her, even turning down a major opportunity with an impresario (Morgan) who turns out to be more interested in Jeanette as a girlfriend.\n\nEventually Victor wins over Shirley, and the two move in together. Now, I thought the code came in earlier than this, but it appears I&apos;m wrong. I was very surprised when later in the movie, she suggests that they get married because I thought they already were.\n\nHer song becomes a huge hit. Eventually he succumbs to the impresario&apos;s pressure to get him out of the picture by breaking up with Shirley. He is convinced that he is holding her back. Victor then gets a big opportunity when a star (Segal) agrees to appear in his operetta. When he refuses to be seduced by her, her husband gives her a choice, the operetta or him, Mr. Money Bags, and she leaves with her husband. Now he&apos;s stuck, and he owes money to boot.\n\nThis film ran something like one hour and thirty minutes and seemed longer than Battleship Potemkin. This mainly had to do with the casting of Navarro who could just about carry a tune, and when he did, his voice had a tremelo faster than a butterfly&apos;s wings.\n\nJeanette MacDonald, of course, is luminous - beautiful, charming, and in great voice. Navarro did just not have what it took to be her leading man. As stiff as Nelson Eddy was, there was something about the two of them together that had real chemistry. No such thing here.\n\nThis is a movie, as someone said here, for Jeanette MacDonald fans only. She&apos;s always worth watching, and someone here also mentioned seeing her do King &amp; I. I&apos;m envious.",

      "reviewBody": "Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Belluci star in &quot;Shoot &apos;Em Up,&quot; a 2007 film that I believe is a parody of the action genre. It has to be.\n\nOwen plays a former black ops who helps a woman deliver a baby and then finds himself on the run with the baby as hundreds of people chase him and shoot at him. \n\nI won&apos;t go into the whys and wherefores. I will only say that it is non-stop action, with Owen shooting in all kinds of situations - sliding on oil leaks under cars, having sex, sitting, standing, running, jumping, parachuting out of a plane -- he never stops. When he&apos;s not shooting he&apos;s punching, knifing, or slamming someone&apos;s head somewhere. Or eating a carrot.\n\nMonica Belluci is the hooker he asks to help care for the baby as the two of them run for their lives, the baby in tow wearing a bullet-proof vest.\n\nThe body count is unbelievable.\n\nExciting, fun, bloody, violent, and preposterous, you&apos;ll be on the edge of your seat rooting for him to make the world safe.\n\nSomeone once told me that movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Taiwan. This kind of action film definitely is. You can sit back and watch car chases, thermal guns, nudity, you name it - you don&apos;t need to know a word of English. \n\nClive Owen comes up against Paul Giamatti, and the two actors couldn&apos;t be more different. Owen is deadpan and deadly, Giamatti is a showman who can play an evil character like this or comedy with equal facility. I understand he recently played, of all things, Hamlet, and received wonderful reviews. \n\nI really hope Clive Owen plays James Bond. I think he&apos;d be wonderful.",

      "reviewBody": "Granted, Asoka doesn&apos;t really bring anything new to Indian cinema but then when do many films? This film should be given its due in that its better than most Indian movies of the day - way better. Therefore immediate criticism is harsh.\n\nThe music first of all is...very cool. Yes, its not yr typical music of the Indian setting but if u listen, Anu Malik has done something very interesting with the classical instruments of the age. This music has an evolved feel to it, that actually serves the movie very well. Its was an ambitious move that the director pulled off. So many bollywood films have the same songs, the same formula, the same dreary uninventive sound - these songs were different sounding, even if they touched on the same typical subjects. And the lyrics are beautiful in a lot of them (granted not the &apos;tayar hoja&apos;). \n\nthe script wasn&apos;t amazing but far surpasses the embarrassing lines of some many other Indian movies but it served its purpose. the actions scenes were better crafted then most Indian cinema pieces - the use of cgi would have been tacky and poor - until we have an industry that can create a war scene on full scale its a bad idea.. Shah rukh khan did a good job, kareena kapoor was beautiful (and I&apos;m not a big fan). no one acted cringingly as so many Indian actors do.\n\nfinally, yes, the movie may have achieved something more had it been historically correct, but u r warned as a viewer that the film isn&apos;t historically correct and some features are fictional. who cares? its still good cinema. not everything needs a wonderful sweeping message."

      "reviewBody": "In his novel &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; the Canadian writer Robertson Davies made the point that although the Arthurian legend had played an immensely influential role in the history of English literature, there had never been a particularly distinguished dramatic treatment of the story, either in the theatre or in the cinema. (Davies discounts Purcell&apos;s opera on the grounds that its plot differs radically from what we have come to think of as the Arthurian story). And yet the story seems to offer great dramatic possibilities, both in its adventure elements and in the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle. \n\n&quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; was the second in an unofficial trilogy of films on a mediaeval theme made by producer Pandro S. Berman and director Richard Thorpe, all of which starred Robert Taylor. (The others in the trilogy, both based on the novels of Sir Walter Scott, were Ivanhoe and The Adventures of Quentin Durward). It is based upon Thomas Malory&apos;s &quot;Le Morte d&apos;Arthur&quot;, although it makes some changes. The Quest for the Holy Grail plays a less important role in the film than in the book,   Elaine is Lancelot&apos;s wife rather than his lover, and their son Galahad, who plays a key role in the book, only appears as a baby. Apart from Lancelot and the villain Mordred (here referred to as &quot;Modred&quot;), the most prominent of the knights is Sir Percival, in this version Elaine&apos;s brother. \n\nThe film is ostensibly set in the Britain of the 5th or 6th century, after the end of the Roman occupation, but as is usual in films on this theme (the recent &quot;King Arthur&quot; being an exception) the costumes, armour and buildings are all based upon those of the High Middle Ages, that is to say of Malory&apos;s day rather than of Arthur&apos;s. Arthur&apos;s kingdom is always referred to as &quot;England&quot;, even though the historic Arthur (assuming that he was a real person) would never have used this term. The Celts would always have referred to &quot;Britain&quot;, the name &quot;England&quot; (&quot;Land of the Angles&quot;) being used only by their Anglo-Saxon enemies. \n\nThe story begins with Britain in turmoil, divided among various warring overlords. Arthur, the illegitimate son of the former ruler Uther Pendragon, is able to unite the kingdom and, with the help of Lancelot and the wizard Merlin, to defeat his main challengers, his half-sister Morgan Le Fay and her son Modred. (Anne Crawford who plays Morgan was only eight years older than Stanley Baker, who plays her son. Presumably the explanation is that Morgan&apos;s enchantments have been able to preserve her youthful looks, and things could have been worse. The original choice for Modred was George Sanders, fourteen years older than Crawford). After his victory Arthur pardons Morgan and Modred, against Lancelot&apos;s advice, but they continue to plot against him, and see the growing attraction between Lancelot and Arthur&apos;s wife Guinevere as their chance to make trouble. \n\nOne of the problems with Arthurian films and plays is that the love- triangle is so central to the plot that it requires three high-quality performances if it is to succeed. Taylor here makes an attractively dashing Lancelot, although the film misses one of the key themes of Malory&apos;s work. In Malory Lancelot, an otherwise ideal knight, is morally compromised by his adulterous affair with Guinevere, but in this version their love is not physically consummated, possibly in order to keep the censors happy, and the result is that he seems a much less morally ambiguous figure. The film tries to contrast the &quot;flawed&quot; Lancelot with the idealised Percival, but Lancelot&apos;s flaws seemed to me very minor ones. \n\nArthur is another complex character, difficult to realise on screen, because he is on the one hand a powerful, heroic monarch and on the other someone compromised by his status as a cuckold. In mediaeval literature cuckolds were generally seen as weak, pitiable or ridiculous, like Alison&apos;s husband in Chaucer&apos;s &quot;Miller&apos;s Tale&quot;. Probably the best screen Arthur I have seen was Sean Connery in &quot;First Knight&quot;, but that film subtly altered the traditional tale by making Arthur much older than Guinevere or Lancelot. Here Arthur comes across as a forgettable nonentity when he should be at the film&apos;s centre, and this is due partly to the wooden acting of Mel Ferrer and partly to the sanitising of the Lancelot/Guinevere relationship which also removes much of the interest from Arthur&apos;s character. As for Ava Gardner, she certainly makes a lovely Guinevere, but she was capable of much better acting than this. (As, for example, in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; the following year). Baker is not bad as Modred, but I think that Sanders, who had been so effective as Brian de Bois-Guilbert in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, would have been better. \n\nThe film is visually attractive, with much emphasis on pageantry and spectacle, but I did not enjoy it as much as &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. (I have never seen &quot;Quentin Durward&quot;). It is certainly better than the dull and turgid &quot;King Arthur&quot;, but the problems with characterisation made me aware just why it can be so difficult to make an effective Arthurian drama and to understand what Robertson Davies may have meant by his dictum. 6/10",

Frank wolf (film maker and adventurist) with his friend and co-worker Taku Hokoyama embark on a 3000km 80 day canoe trip from downtown Winnipeg Manitoba to his cottage near Parry Sound Ontario. Instead of reading an article in any geographic magazine about the issues affecting the Boreal Forest. Frank takes us along and gives us a first hand look at the state of the Boreal Forest as well as well as the issues of the Boreal Forest that are affecting the communities and aboriginal communities that live within it. Frank tackles all the issues such as global warming, logging, damming rivers for hydro electric power, mining, corperate polluting of rivers and how each one specifically endangers the Boreal Forest and wildlife living within it. Frank interviews individuals in the communities along the way to get a strong opinion with the issues facing the Boreal Forest from the people living within it. Frank and Taku give us a real sense of adventure. The beauty, the physical demands, the equipment malfunctions, how the Boreal Forest regenerates itself after a forest fire and even describes how the air and water is so much different. Frank and Taku maintain a hilarious sense of humour as well as showing the viewer how they enjoy and benefit from what the Boreal Forest has to offer as well as it&apos;s importance globally.",

      "reviewBody": "This is very slickly made film which sadly doesn&apos;t have a good reputation or a decent widescreen release. The camera-work on the film is excellent with much moving camera a great score and good locations.\n\nThe odd thing is the bursts of full frontal nudity and one really graphic death scene. These seem to be included for fans of Bronson&apos;s gritty films but seem totally out of place here.\n\nSondra is dull as usual. Bronson solid. Robards doesn&apos;t seem to want to be bothered by doing a German accent. It has real visual sweep. Odd rather forced voice over which seems to be trying to set this up for a sequel perhaps at the end.\n\nDespite these forced elements--of violence, nudity,and nostalgia--the bulk of the film works as a mystery and intrigue--rather than say action. One of the few of director Thompson&apos;s later films that really hearken back to his early Hollywood career of sweeping location quasi epics.\n\nThe ending builds suspense only to pay it off in an offbeat--and perhaps off putting way for some. Jerry Goldsmith contributes a fantastic score too, btw.\n\nDeserves more respect and proper restoration than it gets especially among the later career of Bronson. In fact, as a bit of an update a blu ray of the film does now exist, you can see and enjoy the widescreen phototgraphy to it&apos;s full impact. The blu ray also includes a well made making-of-film done at the time, by one of Gregory Peck&apos;s children, no less!",

There are two parts; the film itself is great, clever, funny and lovely in an intelligent way beside of some clichés. This part has all of his elements for a well-made humanistic movie. The other part is somehow political so actually I don&apos;t want to talk about it, because I don&apos;t know much about this. But as I know almost every other exile movies about this subject, this is just a remade and it repeats the story of the political refugees. I don&apos;t want to say that the story is not true but it is not fair to always represent this country in this way, specially in this time that we have not too much Movie titles about this country. So why always this subject? What about something new? Just look at the &quot;Persepolis&quot; , of course it is somehow the same way but the story is really wide ranged. So people, if you are going to invest so much time and money to make film, please go for something new. I think we have enough titles about this subject."

The other music in the film has been used before in Bruno Nicolai westerns.",

Is there connecting material?  Well, yeah - of the thinnest sort imaginable.  Does the lack of a coherent plot hurt the film?  Not really.  Bottom line: it&apos;s hilarious. Groucho in particular steals the show with his weird combination flirting/insulting routines.\n\nIt&apos;s worth noting that, while I laughed a lot at &quot;A Night at the Opera,&quot; I laughed even more at this movie.  In fact, I was in exquisite pain by the end.  Of course, &quot;Opera&quot; actually makes some sense, so it might still be the better movie.\n\nDefinitely the best Marx Brothers film that doesn&apos;t feature Margaret Dumont, and the strongest showcase for the brothers&apos; talents as physical comedians.",

      "reviewBody": "I found myself glued to the television despite my inability to understand most of the early dialog in The 13th Warrior. Curiosity kept me from turning away and the action hooked me. Antonio Banderas&apos; performance is intelligent and understated. He may headline, but the unknown actors take the lead with very strong performances. Omar Sharif is certainly recognizable, but of limited exposure here. It&apos;s sad that he belittled such a great movie because of it&apos;s box office failure. This movie has a LOTR feel about it without the high end production. The production here is just right for the story and cast. The main attraction over LOTR is that it only runs 103 minutes. Beware, if you are easily affected by carnage. But, if you enjoy a classic tale of good vs. evil and competitive action, you will embrace this adventure.",

      "reviewBody": "Once In A New Moon (1935) -\n\nFor a film from 1935 I could forgive a lot of the obvious errors and foibles, because essentially it wasn&apos;t a bad one at all, if a bit simplistic and silly. It had none of the finesse of later science fiction films or any elements of actual science that I could see either. The idea of an island being ripped from the planet and floating off in to space wasn&apos;t exactly what I&apos;d call sound physics, although I admit that I used to skip school on the days I had science class, because the teacher was an idiot, but &apos;Star Trek&apos; (1966-) taught me a few things at least.\n\nWith that aside, the story itself was quite an interesting idea and it had similarities to &apos;Passport To Pimlico&apos; (1949) with the towns attempts to self govern and the issues that in itself caused.\n\nUnfortunately they all spoke so fast that it was hard to keep up with what they were saying, which was where its simplicity came in handy. It was also very British, in that everybody just got on with things over a cup of tea and caused no real riots until the townsfolk decided to depose their government.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t say that anyone stood out for their acting, either good or bad. As for the production, it was clever in the way that they didn&apos;t have to come up with anything too scientific or astrological to make the story work.\n\nOverall, it was a fun little tale, but nothing to tell the world and his Mother about.\n\n471.09/1000.",

The remake it&apos;s really good fun, it&apos;s a romantic comedy, love story, fairy tale, whatever you wanna name it, it&apos;s gooood !!!!\n\nI liked this movie because of the story, it&apos;s uncommon, it&apos;s unpredictable! Honestly, I&apos;m tired of the classic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy get&apos;s girl back or vice-versa. This one actually made me feel the story and believe the characters.\n\nTotally watchable. Totally underrated. Totally...excellent! \n\nEnjoy!"

He&apos;s collecting money at his rally and preaching up a storm when some masked bandits armed with automatic weapons take off with the proceeds. The money gets hidden in a bale of cotton and then the bale gets ripped off.\n\nOur two detectives got a whole host of suspects, some white numbers gangsters from Pleasant Avenue, black militants, the good reverend himself who St. Jacques has a passionate dislike for and various and assorted other criminal types. Lockhart is one charismatic preacher and as he says himself, he could be another Marcus Garvey who immediately came to mind before Lockhart mentioned his name during the film.\n\nJohn Anderson and Eugene Roche are St. Jacques and Cambridge&apos;s superiors in the police department, Anderson impatient with them and Roche inclined to give them plenty of room to maneuver. Judy Pace plays Lockhart&apos;s mistress and one seductive temptress if there ever was one. And we can&apos;t forget Redd Foxx in a delightful performance as an old rummy whose ship might just be coming in.\n\nCotton Comes To Harlem moves at a very fast pace with absolutely not a wasted frame of film. It holds up very well after almost 40 years even if those fashions and those Afros don&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "In the late 1930s and into the 1940s, Ralph Bellamy had a peculiar niche in films. He was cast as the boyfriend who will lose the leading lady by the end of the film in approximately 48230 films (give or take). Again and again, you KNOW by the end of the movie he&apos;ll be left alone, so when I saw him dating Dennis Morgan&apos;s ex-wife (Merle Oberon) in this movie, I knew he&apos;d be a miserable loser eventually!\n\nThe film begins with Morgan learning that his wife&apos;s divorce is final and he connives to get her back--though she&apos;s now with Bellamy(!) of all people! So, he&apos;s off to get her...and pretty Rita Hayworth is following, as she wants him and is thrilled that he&apos;s now divorced. While all of this is reasonably enjoyable, I couldn&apos;t help thinking that I&apos;ve seen similar films many times--and often the other films were a bit better. After all, while Moran and Oberon were fine, the likes of Cary Grant, Irene Dunne or Rosalind Russell simply were better. My advice is see &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;\n\nor &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; instead. The plots are rather similar (and some even feature Bellamy as the sap) and are just better--better written, acted and directed.\n\nThe verdict--a good film but nothing especially new.",

      "reviewBody": "Does it matter if a concept is powerful but damaged in the execution? It probably does. We send things out in the world hoping they work, a broken bowl does not. But, you are going to be a much happier viewer and person, once you realize that nothing around us is really ever finished, merely abandoned in various states of doing and repair.\n\nArtists who consciously strive for perfection only achieve their limits of vision - and conversely limit ours. They may offer an overwhelming sensory experience, surely Kubrick did several times, Coppola once or twice. But that is at the cost of breathing room for the soul.\n\nAntonioni was a master of cultivating from deliberate damage in the story - people went missing, in one striking instance of Blowup, right before our eyes, affairs were not consummated, the mystery was not solved, reality was instead open-ended, elusive, currents of cool transparent air from a window. Inplace of ordinary flow, our eye climbed out through the curtains on a journey of meditation and landscape.\n\nJancso came to Italy when Antonioni was on his way out, during turbulent times. He decided on a youth film, a &apos;May of &apos;68&apos; thing. But he does not settle for protest or rebellious paean, though a communist himself and out of the reach of Hungarian censors. He goes to work with Antonioni&apos;s leading lady and cinematographer.\n\nHe gives us confused , unstable times through a single woman&apos;s confused , unstable experience on the streets. She is a journalist, someone ostensibly investigating the &apos;truth&apos; of stories. The pursuit is for clarity. While reporting on a protest, she is assaulted by youth of some far-right organization and that begins to tear in her sense of reality.\n\nThe experience is anxiety and how that perturbs reality and seeing, a subject more deeply of interest to me and one that covers many great works. The most usual way of doing this is by creating hallucination, for example Repulsion.\n\nThere is no hallucination here. We move through space as she does, without explanation, going places without clear purpose, meeting people without proper introductions. Narrative seems muddled, but only because it is so in life. Vision is otherwise clean, time is &apos;real-time&apos;. Light is transparent. Jancso doesn&apos;t smother you in stylistic texture, the film glides on air and the passing of time. \n\nEven so &apos;ordinary reality&apos; can be oblique, the film demonstrates why. It&apos;s so cool the way it was envisioned.\n\nThe film is almost entirely whispered in voice-over. We try to make sense of shady happenings by following the story she narrates. But her own thoughts intrude. Our eye is tethered to her but now and then floats away as her thought does. And this is how we experience reality, in a continuous mindstream of events and our own running commentary to them. Half of cinema is about this for a reason.\n\nThis notion of transparent seeing subject to intrusion extends to the architecture of her house - a pool of open space bared naked by glass doors on all sides, vulnerable to the gaze.\n\nSo why does it falter? I think it is a matter of language and having a foreign filmmaker unable to mould the Italian temperament - Italians are not introverts, they keep a lot on the surface. It works in comedy, but you have to mute them for more serious stuff. Antonioni knew just how.\n\nVitti is our only anchor here, and though a ravishing blonde, she does not give off the impression of being really immersed in her experience. She is acting on her skin - and this is a film about deep commitment, to love, to political dreams, to the recording of truth. The spell is broken.\n\nStill. I think you need to have this at some point. A more powerful viewing would be to note what is retained and what not four years later in Antonioni&apos;s Passenger, nominally the most powerful cinema I know (similarly hampered by an actor acting). Notice the one element that is not transferred and how that changes everything."

But to my surprise, the guy had plenty of dialog and did a good job pulling off the realism of the particular role that he played. If i had the option to watch it again, i probably would... though i wouldn&apos;t recommend it as a double watch. The story line was well put together over all. It was not a Hollywood Hit, of course. But in my opinion, one would not be disappointed to have paid to go see this flick. And the other actor&apos;s were right on point as they normally are. Im looking forward to another one like this. Next time ought to be a real Banger.",

The storyline, acting, appearence of the puppets themselves, etc, were truly awful. There is nothing I can think of positive to say about this movie.\n\nI realize the Nazi Germany story is part of the Puppet Master series, but still. The plot here was atrocious.\n\nThis is definitely a Puppet Master film I never want to see again. Retro Puppet Master was the last decent Puppet Master film. Everything after Retro Puppet Master isn&apos;t worth watching at all.\n\nI would say it&apos;s worth it to watch the first 7 Puppet Master movies, but stop there. Just don&apos;t watch anything after Retro. Retro and Curse are GREAT compared to this.",

Some of the sandy parts look as if they are filmed on the Island of Sylt in the North See. The black girl looks painted in black, the white girl with the never ending legs is beautiful Marion Michael, who walks through Cairo with rolled up shorts. That was German sex in the late fifties shortly after world war II. Still nice to look at and quite entertaining, the crew must really have had some fun with the girl or the other way round. Former German star Adrian Hoven is less sexy, but okay to look at and not a too poor actor. Rick Bataglia on the other hand is in no way an Arabic looking slave merchant, Friedrich Joloff is pretty good as the villain, but there is no reasonable plot, not to mention the absence of a director who has  little more in mind than showing Marions nice body. Even the editor is so extremely fascinated that he allows Marion to ride beyond the horizon until he closes the take.\n\nThe guy mentioned as scriptwriter, if one is brave enough to call it\n\na scenario, is famous Ernst von Salomon the author of a great post war book &apos;Der Fragebogen&apos;; well he also had to make a living.\n\nMichael Zabel",

      "reviewBody": "I had just went to see a pre-screening of pulse last night, and I must say that it was not all that bad compared to recent horror films. The main problem with pulse is that in trying to be original it borrows from other films. I understand that this is an American version of a film from Japan. The film just reminded me of too many other films for me really to appreciate it. Once again this was a pre-screening and I am 100% sure that parts of the version I have seen will be changed. The other problem with pulse is that it is very hard to follow at times, and you are left to interpret the movie in your own way. The deaths are also very cheesy, and not really that creative. I am a huge horror fan and I was really interested to see this film because of the trailer that I very much enjoyed. The movie gets a boost in points for breaking away from the normal horror films we have been seeing as of late. Another thing that I had to pick at was the mediocre acting of the main star Kristen Bell. She just did not give a great performance...the rest of the cast with the exception of Ziagler give somewhat good performances. To continue on the scares were another part that bothered me..once again we see a pg13 movie relying on loud noises and crashes to make the audience jump...but on a brighter side there are a few scenes (the laundry room scene, and the car attack scene towards the end) that were actually pretty scary. One last thing the ending is not all that great, it is one of those things that you either love or hate...the audience at our screening mainly hated it, I will assume it will be changed come the release date. Overall &quot;Pulse&quot; is a decent horror film which is a step above the horror movies that I have seen as of late, just do not be surprised if you are left scratching your head after this film is over.",

      "reviewBody": "Leprechaun in the Hood (2000)\n\n* (out of 4) \n\nAnother awful entry in an all-around awful series. This time out a pimp (Ice-T) steals the gold from the leprechaun (Warwick Davis) and manages to get the medallion around his neck turning him to stone. Flash-forward a couple decades an a rap trio decide to break into the pimp&apos;s home and steal some cash but end up taking the medallion and freeing the leprechaun. The only joke about LEPRECHAUN IN THE HOOD is the title itself. I&apos;m sure this silly title was a hit among video renters and I&apos;m sure this thing sold or rented millions of copies. I mean, we did eventually get a sequel to this thing. This fifth film in the series pretty much puts the horror elements on the back burner and instead we have the leprechaun getting into all sorts of situations. Now I&apos;m sure there will be someone out there who witnesses these situations as nothing more than racial stereotypes but if you&apos;re taking a movie called LEPRECHAUN IN THE HOOD seriously then you have many more problems than could be dealt with in this movie. The entire joke is that the leprechaun finds himself in the hood and sadly there&apos;s just nothing funny about it. You know having the lep and Ice-T in the same movie that at some point the two would have to smoke some weed. When this scene happens it&apos;s just silly and certainly not funny. Other scenes has a Korean store owner who of course tries to rap. Another sequence has a cross-dressing hooker trying to pick up the lep. We even have an entire subplot dealing with the three rappers trying to get their business done so that they can appear at a rap contest in Las Vegas. What&apos;s so annoying about that is that us poor viewers have to sit through some of the worst rap songs I&apos;ve ever heard. They&apos;re corny, poorly written and are just so annoying that you can&apos;t help but want to hit the fast forward button. The entire movie could have been exploitation gold but instead we just get a cheap mess of a film that has no scares or laughs. The movie isn&apos;t nearly as over-the-top as one would hope and what gore you do get just looks rather silly. The previous four films were pretty bad but at least Davis gave it his all and usually delivered a memorable performance. Even that&apos;s not the case here because he too just seems bored with the material."

      "reviewBody": "Thoroughly unentertaining Arabian Nights adventure yarn, let down by a plodding derivative script and a lack of budget which fails to make any of the sets or locations realistic. The film consists of people fighting, talking, getting captured, escaping, fighting, round and round in an endless circle with little in the way of originality to distinguish it from the other Italian productions of the period. I still find it hard to understand why the Italians decided to make Ali Baba films without any magical elements or exoticism, aside from that old cliché of the &quot;Open Sesame!&quot; hidden door - surely the exotic locales and characters should be exploited to their full extent rather than going through the motions in what, if you changed the settings and costumes, would be another run-of-the-mill peplum yarn.\n\nAll in all it&apos;s a pretty violent film with lots of people dying violent, tortured deaths. Unfortunately the action scenes are few and far between and invariably disappoint in their sheer shoddiness, with guys hitting each other with lumps of wood with no skill. Sometimes somebody hits someone else with a sword but there&apos;s no blood. The only time this film gets kind-of exciting is in the blood-and-thunder finale. The best thing this production has to offer are some colourful costumes and a &quot;far eastern&quot; theme tune which is repeated over and over throughout. Rod Flash (VULCAN, SON OF JUPITER) is the musclebound meathead of a hero who wanders through the plot, Bella Cortez (GIANT OF METROPOLIS) the most watchable plot element as the voluptuous love interest who wanders around in low-cut clothes. The bad guy, as played by Furio Meniconi, isn&apos;t nearly evil enough for this kind of production.\n\nAlso thrown into the cooking pot of the plot are a friendly dwarf, tribal dances, a wicked witch who consults her crystal ball, a huge spiked pendulum torture device which knocks people into burning pits, a gang of guys in joke-shop fright masks, Ali Baba&apos;s hilarious &quot;screams&quot; of agony when he gets wounded, the same bloody wound being burnt closed with a knife, and some mystical mumbo jumbo but no special effects - the budget wouldn&apos;t stretch that far. There&apos;s always something going on in the film but the problem is that it just isn&apos;t very interesting. Three years later, director Emimmo Salvi returned with ALI BABA AND THE 7 SARACENS, an unconnected sequel which saw Rod Flash (apparently without his muscles), Bella Cortez, and the dwarf actor returning in a greatly improved and more entertaining production - thanks in part to Gordon Mitchell&apos;s totally over-the-top portrayal of the manic bad guy. See that one instead.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is unique and innovative. It is somewhat of fairytale like Cinderella and reminds me of Big Fish (2003), but is also very dark and depressive like say Requiem for a Dream (2000). It follows the hardship-laden life of Matsuko through the gradual discoveries of her nephew and the people he encounters.\n\nIt is extreme in content and in appearance, but touches very true and deep feelings &amp; fears within all of us. It explores the meaning of life and asks very interesting questions. It does so while treating life&apos;s inevitable tragedies with humour and gaiety. The visual style and music are important elements of the movie as they share a positive-looking outlook of life even in the dimmest of circumstances.\n\nThe drama is centered around the dysfunctional family Matsuko was both the product of and the most disruptive element in its spiral towards destruction. Friendship, love and professional lives are also well explored, although as you can imagine, none of them in an ideal, truly rewarding way. The bleakness of the story and the brightness of the storytelling makes for a very interesting contrast. There are many beautiful shots (even if a bit CGI-heavy) and the inherent beauty of life is revealed through the crust of old, piled up garbage.\n\nThe storytelling is very fresh and even though it sags at some points as the film never seems to end, it does get its point across in a artsy and non-threatening way. I was so involved with the demanding story that I was literally shocked as I exited the dark theater to see other people lined up for the next movie at the FantAsia festival. After a viewing experience like this, I found myself surprised that there could be more movies after that or, possibly, that there may be anything after that! This is how profoundly I was affected. &quot;Memories&quot; is not a movie you just eat up and leave, you really need to settle and digest before you can truly understand and internalize.\n\nA tough journey, a good message and possibly a lot of positive ramifications in art &amp; life.

      "reviewBody": "This film was shown at the Cannes film festival nearly a decade ago and apparently received more walkouts than any film in the festival&apos;s history--and &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; won the grand prize here?\n\nUnlike most films that use sex and violence to help sell them, Greenaway seems to have no interest in &quot;selling&quot;.  The story he tells--which takes the form of a play attended by royalty and commonfolk alike--is a Shakespearian fable regarding a young woman (Julia Ormond) who uses her disfigured mother&apos;s newborn as a messiah-like figure to gain wealth and comfort, much to the dismay of the church (repped by Ralph Fiennes).\n\nTo say that the writer/director of this film is a sick person because of what happens in the story is shortsighted, at best.  Yes, there are truly heinous atrocities committed by some of these characters--but the manner in which it is depicted does nothing to suggest glamour or vicarious thrills. David Lynch&apos;s Golden Palm winner, on the other hand, is full of all manner of freaks and malicious acts played mostly for laughs.  Greenaway definitely got the soiled end of the stick on this one.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame, too.  This film recently played for just a few nights in one of Chicago&apos;s most prominent art theaters.  It&apos;s never received anything remotely close to a nationwide theatrical or video release, and it&apos;s my favorite Greenaway film, second only to &quot;The Cook, the Thief...&quot;.  If one is interested in this sort of experience and has a fairly strong stomach, I&apos;d recommend a theatrical screening in a minute."

      "reviewBody": "By the time twenty minutes have passed the movie presents us with its first major problem as horrifying violence, spurred by religious zealotry, is accompanied by music that wouldn&apos;t sound out of place in the TV programs of Monty Python, or maybe Benny Hill. From there we&apos;re treated to other indiscretions that are perhaps not quite as glaringly severe, but very notable all the same: language surrounding indigenous people that feels antiquated even by the standards of the western genre; dialogue and plot development that feels brusque and simplified, and too easy, to the point of contrivance; a weird deficient of plot heading into the second half, when all of a sudden it seems to pick up again with equally strange abruptness. With all this said, in a broader sense the picture quite struggles to find a consistent tone as it wavers between strong violence, attempted levity, hard-nosed investigation and conspiracy, and even giallo-like intricacy. For lack of a consistent tone, even at its darkest, the picture has a hard time evoking a sense of thrills. All these oddities are unfortunate in and of themselves, and more so as they detract from the value &apos;Heads or tails&apos; otherwise has to offer.\n\nEven if we put aside these matters, I couldn&apos;t say that the feature is perfect. I think filmmaker Piero Pierotti&apos;s screenplay is rather solid at large, or at least, it bears solid potential. I recognize in the characters, scene writing, and narrative a host of delicious flavors and complexities, not least in Sybille Burton. It&apos;s a delight to see these swirled together in a genre that, while of course known for violence, doesn&apos;t often carry such particulars. I recognize fine capability and mindfulness in Pierotti&apos;s direction. The trouble is that in addition to the dialogue and plot development being brusque and simplified, it doesn&apos;t quite feel like the characters, scene writing, or narrative are entirely fleshed out, as though we&apos;re only seeing maybe 50-75% of the detail they should ideally boast. Why, Will Hunter is a prime example - his background is clear; his motivations are less so, and as a result the ending feels like a bit of Movie Magic. This also goes for the direction, as something just feels a little off, a little peculiarly insufficient, subsequently impacting the performances, too. &apos;Heads or tails&apos; is very enjoyable, and absorbing, but there&apos;s something missing.\n\nMy words have been more critical than not, but don&apos;t misunderstand - I really do like this film. There&apos;s some cleverness and intelligence here; it&apos;s engaging, entertaining, and satisfying. And it&apos;s definitely worth mentioning that, even noting the inelegance in the writing and direction, this is pretty well made. Stunts, effects, and action sequences are basically as swell as any that Italian westerns might claim. The production design, art direction, and costume design are terrific, and I admire the hair and makeup work no less. On a fundamental level the feature looks and sounds great, and it&apos;s a good time all the while. What I think it comes down to is that all the deficiencies stack up - deficiency of consistent tone, of detail, of balance in storytelling - and diminish the best possibilities of what &apos;Head or tails could have been. It&apos;s good; it could have been great. For all this, though, I still believe it&apos;s worth checking out on its own merits, even standing taller than some of its genre brethren. It&apos;s maybe not a total must-see, but if you have a chance to watch, this is a splendid way to spend 90 minutes.",

Also, not in ways that felt derivative or too samey. I think this is entirely its own thing, even to the point where I don&apos;t know completely what to make of it, but I liked the experience it offered. It&apos;s slow, quiet, and empty, but always has something under the surface to keep things feeling oddly energized and going forward.\n\nThere&apos;s also a strong sense of mystery at the heart of August in the Water that I wasn&apos;t really expecting would be resolved, but that&apos;s okay. It feels like it&apos;s exploring things that are beyond our understanding, maybe a little like the eerie - yet not exactly scary - scenes near the end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (which I got reminded me a bit of). There&apos;s also the sense of a very quiet, understated, and probably realistic set of vaguely apocalyptic occurrences (if you choose to read accidents and misfortunes that way), and the very by-the-numbers ways these things occurred made me think of Threads a bit.\n\nIt&apos;s a bold-looking movie; never too flashy, but never boring to take in. It captures the pleasant boredom and heat of summer well, and is remarkably different to the other films I&apos;ve seen from Gakuryû Ishii, at least stylistically. If it starts to lose the plot a little at the end... I can&apos;t be too mad. That was always likely, and also I&apos;m tired, so maybe I missed something. But I do feel like there was a quality to this that was engrossing, and while it was super slow, I didn&apos;t feel it was boring very often at all. The use of music also stood out to me, and definitely added something.",

In Miami, the dirty businessman Carl Ridley (Bill Paxton) is chased by Federal agents and escapes with his teenage daughter Pippa (Agnes Bruckner) to Cayman Island trying to reach his lawyer Mr. Allen (Stephen Dillane). Pippa meets the small time thief Fritz (Victor Rasuk) sleeping in her room and he invites her to go a party. Before leaving the condo, Fritz sees Carl counting lots of money. Fritz owes money to the dangerous drug dealer Richie Rich (Razaaq Adoti) and tells him about the fortune Carl has. Along a Friday 13th night, their lives entwine in a chain of tragic events.\n\n&quot;Haven&quot; is an entertaining movie, with a complex non-linear screenplay with many characters that have their lives entwined. There are many credible sub-plots and considering the running time of 99 minutes, the situations and characters are very well-developed. The direction and acting are great, there are many beautiful locations but the screenplay is really top-notch. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Haven&quot;",

Not every comedy was written by Neil Simon or Woody Allen.  Of course, the fact that I saw it when it was first released (more than 10 years ago) might have something to do with my enjoyment factor.  The special effects, especially by today&apos;s standards, are pretty corny.  But, all in all, it was enjoyable. And hey, after all, where else can you get to see T.V.&apos;s Buffy the Vampire Slayer stars, Alyson Hannigan and Seth Green, when they first appeared as boyfriend and girlfriend, years before their television romance began?!",

      "reviewBody": "Since this is Black History Month and I&apos;m reviewing African-Americans on film in mostly chronological order, let&apos;s start my review of Zenobia by mentioning three of the players: Stepin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and Philip Hurlic. Stepin (spelled Step&apos;n in the credits) is Zero-the butler. He&apos;s quite funny with his talking under his breath about his thoughts every time he gets ordered. Having seen quite a few of his performances now, I have tolerated his presence a bit more because of some of the subtle brightness he brings to his parts. Hattie (whose last name has an &apos;s&apos; added in the credits) brings the same commanding presence that I last saw in Show Boat, which I just watched this morning. And Philip, the kid here that I just saw in The Green Pastures, as Zeke proves to be the most intelligent one in the movie when he recites The Declaration of Independence with the reward being a quarter from Oliver Hardy&apos;s character of Dr. Tibbett. They all were fine performances here despite some of the stereotypes they&apos;re forced to play. Now, with Hardy briefly split from Stan Laurel (because of the latter&apos;s dispute with Hal Roach), he&apos;s the carrier of this movie and he does just fine especially in his scenes with Harry Langdon and an elephant, Zenobia, that Langdon-as Professor McCrackle-owns. Those scenes are the most &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot;-like in the film. Also in fine form were Billie Burke as Hardy&apos;s wife, Bessie Tibbett, Olin Howard as Attorney Culpepper, and J. Farrell McDonald, another supporting player from my favorite movie-It&apos;s a Wonderful Life (he played the old man whose tree was hit by George Bailey&apos;s car), as the Judge. One other note: Jean Parker who plays Hardy&apos;s daughter Mary Tibbett here, would later in the year play his potential fiancée in The Flying Deuces which marked Laurel and Hardy&apos;s re-teaming. So on that note, I highly recommend Zenobia. Oh, and having just seen the Hall Johnson Choir in The Green Pastures, it&apos;s nice hearing them here too.",

(In case you don&apos;t know, the story is about an old scholar who makes a pact with the devil after realizing that he wasted his youth without achieving any enlightenment, and then he is turned into a young man again, falls in love etc. Needless to say there is a tragic outcome)\n\nThis adaptation includes even those scenes that Goethe cut out, because they were too tasteless. I&apos;m talking about the full Walpurgisnacht witch festival on the Blocksberg, including multiple dialogue references to sex, even with children. Also, it is rather free in the adaptation of one other scene, where Mephistopheles has a monologue while masturbating. I remember the words from the play, but the fact that he was masturbating (including a brief display of his devillified penis with extra fur attached to make it look more wicked) must have skipped my mind while reading the play.\n\nApart from being rather mature in its contents, it is a good adaptation, sticking to the text and having good acting. The Faust/Gretchen Marte/Mephisto scene in the garden was quite well done.\n\nA bit tasteless, but complete, and useful if you need to know Faust for school. It fulfills that purpose - otherwise, it is rather too rude in my opinion."

Used to living on the up-side getting used to the down-side is a little hard after all. With mom not being the absolute best role model available it is clear that the son can&apos;t be that either. And so the story rolls.\n\nKnallhart, also known as Tough Enough, is thus a drama film and a fairly good one at that. The realism factor is very high and it is hard not to feel a certain amount of pity for the characters as they evolve through the film. Musical background is fitting for a modern film and feels right, acting isn&apos;t half bad. Overall an enjoyable watch, if a little depressing to see yet another one bite the dust.\n\n8 out of 10 broken futures",

The speeches and dialogs made by Johnny Depp are noteworthy and should be inscribed on a stone . It was well written and it lowered my expectations(due to its rating) and when I saw it , I got a different message . I thought it would be about supernatural powers and computer hacking and somewhat an action movie but turns out to be powerful in its own way.\n\nI would recommend this movie to all people who understand ethics and love a pure tech and logical film.",

In their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed. For his wife Evelyn and best friend Max Waters, both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will&apos;s thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown.

Vittorio Gassman and John Ericson are the two musicians, a violinist and a pianist, but although you would prefer Gassman all the way, Ericson actually improves, while both hopelessly remain in the shadows of her. The best actors, however, are Louis Calhern as the very realistic father and Michael Chekhov as the music professor, who knows the delicacy of his trade. The music is first class all the way, so that in between, when there is no music, you long for the next musical moment to turn up. Best of all is the café scene in the beginning, when all the guests appear to be musical students spontaneously forming an orchestra to accompany Vittorio Gassman. The real violinist is, however, Michael Rabin, and the real pianist of all the solo performances is Claudio Arrau, at the time perhaps the best pianist in the world. The film begins and ends with Rachmaninov&apos;s second and crowns the delightful trio drama with a conclusion which feels right in spite of all.",

      "reviewBody": "Life can appear very strange, when no-one is there to explain it. Especially when you&apos;re a child and you have plenty of questions. This is a big question which started the day when a father, with no explanations left his daughter at an orphanage. A Brand New Life takes its spectator to childhood - to a time when we asked many things and perhaps got no answers and no explanations why things happen exactly this way. Film is through and through seen from the eyes of a child, but brought to it&apos;s richness with the help of a wonderful script and skillful camera, allowing its spectator to put aside for a while his adult point of view and just observe, and try to understand. This is the story of a little girl, Jinhee, played marvelously by Mademoiselle Sae Ron Kim. She poses questions, but there never comes an honest answer why her life has turned out like this.\n\nA Brand New Life achieves a perfect harmony, one element underlines the other one. The long takes allow the spectator to grasp, how long the time in orphanage seemed for Jinhee, the relatively small amounts of dialogs depicts the introvert child, whose emotions break out through some furious actions. The gray tone palette which en-tours the setting of the orphanage shows very understandable the sadness of this place.\n\nFilm touches not only an auto-biographical story, but the sad truth of life – we all know that there are thousands of places like this around the world. And there are thousands of children who, perhaps, have mastered this tragicomic show for the visitors, the potential new families.\n\nIn conclusion I&apos;d like to say that this is a very daring film, knowing that this was a true story and a true childhood, perhaps lived through second by second as we see it on the screen. I must say that it&apos;s a brave choice to put a story like this on the screen. But its greatest value is the absence of a pathos and absence of a depiction the children as a victims of the cruelty of life. A Brand New Life is hope and search for the answers through and through it.",

Overall this is a rather cheezy and lame attempt at the story, with the usual attempts to rewrite and revise the story.\n\nI often wish that someone would attempt a version that is truer to the original book, even though it was penny-dreadful claptrap. All too often they try to make the Phantom so sympathetic that they lose sight of his psychopathic side. However, in the original novel Christine is such a stupid drip that she does get quite annoying.",

Heck, I&apos;d go watch professinal lawn bowling if it had a sexual content warning.\n\nTurns out I lucked into seeing a fine little movie. It caused me to think of the decisions we make and why we make them, and the errors we commit and how they can wind up controlling us.\n\nIt also made me very mad at Seraphin. At one point I was loudly  thinking, &quot;SHOOT HIM! SHOOT HIM!&quot;  But then, truly he was an evil man who deserved his comeupance.\n\nThe sweet lady Donalda bugged me too. If you&apos;ve made a mistake but you get a chance to get over it, wouldn&apos;t you get over it?  &quot;No, it&apos;s much better to stay put and accept your punishment.&quot;  AARGH!!  What&apos;s wrong with you people?  But then, I&apos;m coming from a 20th century anglo-protestant perspective, not an 18th century french-catholic one.\n\nNeat film.

      "reviewBody": "A German film from 1944 is suspect. What to expect?\n\nA propaganda movie? There are some reviews who have discovered some elements of Nazi ideology deep down in the movie, but in general I would not call this a propaganda movie.\n\n A comedy? That makes more sense! The war wasn&apos;t going very well for Germany at this point in time and the public public could use some entertainment to forget for a moment their everyday misery. The lead actor Heinz Ruhmann was an established comedy star in Germany from 1930 onwards.\n\nThe best characterization of the movie however is given by words like nostalgia (&quot;sehnsucht&quot; in German) and melancholy. Das dritte Reich has lost its glamour and the film longs for times gone by (the good old days). This is true for the main character (he longs back to his high school days) and for the film in total (it is situated around 1900).\n\nThe teachers (&quot;Herr Professor&quot; in German) are excentric and rather naive. There is no femme fatale in the movie, but one can imagine that they would have ended just like Professor Rath in &quot;Der Blaue Engel&quot; (1930, Josef von Sternberg) had there been one. For a moment the Nazi regime kept the drollery of the students for rebellion against the authority of the teachers and didn&apos;t give permission for the release of the film. It took a visit from Ruhmann to propaganda minister Goebbels to change his mind. One only has to compare &quot;Die Feuerzangenbowle&quot; with &quot;Zero de conduite&quot; (1933, Jean Vigo) to understand how exagerrated the fear of the Nazi regime was.",

It moves at a clip that supports its gory and odd characters. Some of the pairings are fabulous .. are there really people walking among us that are like that? I prefer to believe they only exist in screenwriters minds. Mirren is her usual superb self and Gooding shows he really can act. The question is were they in love or was he simply controlled by her. I did not look forward to a nude scene with a woman her age but it was handled extremely well. Also the music choices were excellent. I haven&apos;t seen any comments about that aspect of the film.",

The most important thing is that real facts are well-presented and narrated very clearly. Regarding humour, I am afraid there&apos;s no room for humour in here. I recommend to whoever wrote that awful review to go and check out the latest Jim Carrey&apos;s film if he or she is looking for some humour. Unfortunately, I suspect that the author of such one-sided point of view cannot tolerate anything that does not come out of Hollywood whose films are indeed well-structured, well-paced and contain humour but at the same time are mostly idiotic, shallow and meaningless.",

Also the whole story is framed in a cute way as the principals show up for a wedding and his old pals ask where he&apos;s been -- these are all dogs. This leads us into the story, as outlined above.\n\nThe problem, as with many of these animal actor movies, is they didn&apos;t get top notch human actors. Oh, Shumway is fine, as is Whitehorse as the comic relief. It&apos;s just that James Pierce is not very good. He reacts to going blind like Red Skelton drinking Guzzler&apos;s Gin or Lucille Ball demonstrating Vitameatavegemin.\n\nBut the rest of the movie is fine, and the print I saw was in pretty good shape."

      "reviewBody": "NATALE A CAMPO 119 (CHRISTMAS AT CAMP119) was released in the United States under the title ESCAPE INTO DREAMS. It is, in fact, about the dreams of home that Italian prisoners of war have in a P.O.W. camp in California after the war has ended and the ex-soldiers are awaiting release. The cast reads like a who&apos;s-who of some of the best Italian actors and actresses of that period: Vittorio De Sica, Peppino De Filippo, Massimo Girotti, Aldo Fabrizi, Maria Mercader, Vera Carmi, Ave Ninchi. The gifts of radioed voices of families back home and recordings of Italian popular songs conjure up the memories that we see in flashback. They are comic or bittersweet little vignettes with backgrounds of major tourist sights as a kind of visual obbligato. Aldo Fabrizi is seen taking his five little kids through Rome and trying to keep them at a distance as he foolishly flirts with young Vera Carmi on the Aventine Hill. In the Naples &quot;dream&quot; Vittorio De Sica is a nobleman gambler trying to dodge his creditors. His character is similar to that of his role in the episode of &quot;The Gambler&quot; in his THE GOLD OF NAPLES and is similar to his real-life persona as well. With his crafty chauffer Peppino De Filippo, he makes a getaway in a hearse.  In the Florence recollection Aldo Fiorello&apos;s lover Maria Mercader is seen trying to arrange a proxy marriage with an old museum guard Adolfo Mancini to legitimatize the child, a little boy she has had by Aldo after he went away. The Milan and Sicily dreams are short undeveloped bits of nostalgia. In the Venice episode we see gondoliere Massimo Girotti falling for a Norwegian tourist, Olga Villi, who inevitably and humiliatingly ditches him. Connecting all the memories are the scenes in the camp itself, a kind of minor-key STALAG 17 ambience, with an American sergeant played by a miscast Adolfo Celi in a manner that can only be called laughable and ludicrous. It is one of the few unconvincing bits in an otherwise appealing and humane movie directed by Pietro Francisci. Its implied message, aimed at Italian citizens across the political and regional spectrum at a moment of divisive postwar national political turmoil, was that &quot;We may all have different ways of speaking, and have different local customs, but we are all Italians. We are one nation.&quot; One could think of no better message at Christmas time."

Many movies are trying to be more than they are, and this wasn&apos;t one of them. It was very well acted and has great visuals. Often times, movie will go for 1-3 minutes without any dialogue, which I found to be an effective way to tell the story.\n\nMain 3 characters didn&apos;t have any allusions of hope; they were just there trying to survive day-to-day. I am a fan of the Dystopian genre; however, often times, it ends up being unrealistic or trying to a franchise maker. This didn&apos;t try any of it, and just succeeded to be a strong movie.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1948 the Italian journalist and novelist Giovannino Guareschi wrote: Mondo piccolo : Don Camillo (translated in French en 1951 in Le petit monde de Don Camillo).Giovannino Guareschi creates in this book two strong characters: Don Camillo, the priest of Brescella and Giuseppe &quot;Peppone&quot; Bottazzi ,the communist mayor of Brescella.In 1952 French and Italian producers ask the French director Julien Duvivier to direct the &quot;The little world of Don Camillo&quot; with Fernandel and Gino Cervi as main actors. Julien Duvivier is a French director well know by &quot;Sous le ciel de Paris&quot;, &quot;Marie-Octobre&quot; and &quot;The Devil and the Ten commandments&quot;. Fernandel and Gino Cervi don&apos;t need any presentation, there were well known actors in their respective countries. &quot;Don Camillo&quot; is then the story of the rivalry between Don Camillo and Peppone.The two men have fought together in the Italian resistance and now one is the priest of the village and the other one is mayor of the village.We are in the time of the cold war: in Italy there are now two important political parties who dominate the political life in the country and also in this village of the Po Valley.Don Camillo criticizes Peppone and Peppone criticizes Don Camillo.Every one is thinking in the next moves that he can do to annoy the other one,but also, they will help each other in the difficult moments of their lives.I forget to mention an important character of this film ,the narrator who tells quietly and with humour the rivalry betweeen Don Camillo and Peppone.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, which opened in New York recently, was a total surprise. Director Niki Caro has done wonders in bringing this story to the screen as it shows a different and much simple world than the rat race of our society and the horrible times we live in.\n\nThe film presents a glimpse of the Maori society in New Zealand&apos;s North Island. Having visited New Zealand, but not being very familiar with the Maori culture, this film was a refreshing way to learn some aspects of it.\n\nThe story presented here has a lot to do with pride and tradition, which is a running theme among different cultural groups the world over. It has to do with the frustration of Koro by the defection of his eldest son, the designated heir of hundred years of a bloodline where only the males can carry the knowledge and the legends from one generation to the next.\n\nBecause of the rage Porourangi, the eldest son, feels after the death of his wife giving birth to twins, where only the female survives, he leaves his country and the baby girl is taken by the grandparents. The girl, Pai, will grow to be an enchanting girl who will be excluded from the teachings of her grandfather Koro. Even though he loves the girl, he can&apos;t deviate in his narrow vision of the world he knows.\n\nBasically, it is a simple story very well told with a great performance by the child actress Keisha Castle-Hughes. This girl has such a strong magnetism while on camera that one tends to forget the rest of the other characters every time she appears. The grandparents are very well portrayed by Rawiri Paratene and Vicky Houghton. \n\nThis is a film for all ages to enjoy. Compare it with the latest releases from Hollywood, and it&apos;s no wonder to arrive at the conclusion that stories like Whale Rider have such an universal appeal that  should be brought to the screen more often because of the positive way they show a society and its people at its best.",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this one, because I can relate to it. \n\nAt one time in my life I was trying to make films, and experienced many of the same problems Mark Borchardt did in trying to make HIS film. And I also went through a protracted period of self-absorbed arrested development, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I got married, and had kids. I realized that being a struggling filmmaker was, in all likelihood, not going to feed my family. So I got a decent job and did what I felt I needed to do to make that happen. That is what an mature, responsible adult does. \n\nMark hasn&apos;t faced up to that reality as yet, and so, in that sense, he is a retarded adolescent. For this reason, there is a hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn&apos;t realize how bad off he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has kids and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his &quot;artistic vision&quot;. \n\nDespite this, Mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial clout, etc.. Yet he trudges on, much like Ed Wood, apparently without any semblance of a clue. \n\nI guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the &quot;never say die&quot; attitude of this noble individual, struggling against the odds. And man, what odds there are! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all offspring of big-time film or TV people; no doubt, they will all want to direct some day, if they aren&apos;t already. How much room is there for an independent like Mark? It&apos;s like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board, over and over again. Come to think of it, that is pretty close to what happens to one of Mark&apos;s actors, with the kitchen cabinet door, in one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie.\n\nDespite these misgivings and seeming criticisms, I truly enjoyed this movie, and would heartily recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is amazing. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and he told me that, in real life, these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, here&apos;s an oddity: a modern-day film faithful to theological history, an uncompromising biography of Martin Luther.\n\nKnowing the film world, I doubt this film was made to glorify God. It probably was made more to make the Roman Catholic church look bad, or to glorify a rebel and a man of the people: &quot;the peoples&apos; liberation&quot; as the back cover of the DVD states.\n\nWhatever the motive, it stays true to history and it&apos;s nice to see that for a change. To those unfamiliar with Luther, he was the founder of the Protestant denomination. Luther was monk who saw and heard things he thought were unscriptural and broke off from the Catholic Church in &quot;protest.&quot; Hence, the &quot;Protestant&quot; church was formed.\n\nAnyway, not only was the story done well, so was the cinematography. This is one gorgeous movie to ogle, well-filmed with high production values. The scenery, sets and costumes are all first-rate.\n\nJoseph Fiennes (Luther) is a bit wimpy-looking but his character certainly isn&apos;t. As the subject of indulgences and other practices begin to transform Luther&apos;s ideas of what Jesus&apos; church should be, the story grows in intensity as Luther gets pressured by the Catholic hierarchy as his protest issues become public. \n\nWhat happens to him and to the masses because of his actions are revealed in pretty dramatic form. Obviously the story is far more complex than two hours can give it but the filmmakers did a pretty good job condensing it to make the time constriction.\n\nNotes: This was Peter Ustinov&apos;s last movie. On the DVD, being that is was a fairly expensive one, I am surprised there were no &quot;extras.&quot; In all, however, a solid film but it will definitely offend Roman Catholics.",

      "reviewBody": "Paramount Pictures finally gave Billy Wilder a chance to direct his own material with The Major And The Minor. This rather interesting comedy depends a great deal not on just Wilder&apos;s writing and directing, but on the considerable comedy talents of Ginger Rogers to put it over. It&apos;s not easy for an actress in the full flower of maturity to pretend to be an adolescent, but Rogers was certainly up to the task.\n\nRogers plays Susan Applegate from Stevenson, Iowa who has had just about enough of New York. After trying several professions and making no headway in any of them, she&apos;s ready to cash it in and go back to Stevenson, maybe marry a local guy there. But cash is the problem when she comes up just short of the fare from New York to Stevenson. What to do, but pretend she&apos;s a child and travel for half fare.\n\nA rather interesting set of circumstances has her stopping off as a guest of Ray Milland whom she has &apos;fooled&apos; into thinking she is only an early teen. That doesn&apos;t sit well with Milland&apos;s fiancée Rita Johnson, a real ice princess who suspects something&apos;s up. And Johnson&apos;s sister Diana Lynn knows there is, but doesn&apos;t care. Milland is an instructor at a boy&apos;s military school and the sight of his female guest sends the cadets into hormonal overdrive. Milland&apos;s feeling a bit antsy around Rogers though he can&apos;t quite figure out why.\n\nWilder showed that even in his first film he was a master at slipping stuff by the censors. In a recent biography of Billy Wilder that was more important on this film than most because the subject matter was weaving dangerously close to pedophilia. \n\nParamount was disposed to let Wilder have this project especially after another of their writers a couple of years earlier showed he had the directing chops. But Preston Sturges was given a tryout in the studio&apos;s B picture unit with The Great McGinty. The Major And The Minor was an A film all the way because Wilder was able to sell Ginger Rogers on the story. He also brought the film only slightly over budget which definitely insured he would have a directorial career at Paramount.\n\nRobert Benchley is also in the film as a lecherous old goat who is the one who finally sends Rogers packing to Iowa after putting the moves on her while she is trying the profession of masseuse. Wouldn&apos;t you know it, he turns out to be the father of a chip off the old block in the person of Cadet Frankie Thomas. Benchley&apos;s scenes in the film are precious indeed.\n\nThe Major And The Minor still holds up very well after over 60 years, no doubt because of the risqué subject matter. It&apos;s a film definitely guaranteed to make you a fan of the talents of its director and its stars.",

It is more in the B to C category. Trash, that is. But it is not at all pretending to be anything else. Just the other way around, it embraces it&apos;s trashiness by having the villain jumping around in ballet-like moves and similar things. This is one thing that makes this movie very likable. The other is that it is just so funny. If you are not offended by extreme violence and gore.\n\nThe theater was packed with the special kind of audience that is attracted to the Fantasy Film Fest, the kind of audience that will applaud and cheer when a head gets cut off and gallons of blood get poured around. But the cheering didn&apos;t stop there. As soon as the audience got into the movie, and got over an initial impression of crappiness (like a very rudimentary set, bad editing with scenes that were often just a bit too long and actors that were, with the exception of Stephen Dorff, sub par), it became clear to them that the movie is intended as a comedy and delivered funny and unexpected scenes one after another. And the laughter continued throughout the whole movie.\n\nI really enjoyed the movie a lot, and in retrospect did not notice that it was actually 100 minutes long (although cutting 10 minutes off would have helped).\n\nFor it&apos;s great entertainment value (and isn&apos;t that what movies are all about ? ) I give 7 points.

      "reviewBody": "Big bear of a man Rick Montana plays Dr. David Stone, a scientist in Alabama. He&apos;s hired by filthy rich Milton St. John (exploitation legend David F. Friedman) to find what could be the missing link in the Okaloosa wilderness. Stone thinks he&apos;s just being hired to obtain confirmation that this thing exists, but of course he hasn&apos;t been told the truth. He will be accompanied by an air headed &quot;assistant&quot; (shapely blonde Holli Day) and a gang of armed-to- the-teeth yahoos.\n\nThe cast and crew bumble their way through this micro budget schlock flick. The staggering ineptitude on display is only tolerable to a point because the movie commits one of the cardinal sins of cinema: it&apos;s boring. It&apos;s only 70 minutes long, but even that running time is going to feel like a chore to some. &quot;Search for the Beast&quot; basically has no energy, slogging its way from protracted scene to protracted scene. What saves it from a lower rating are some occasionally funnier (and trashier) moments than expected. The &quot;doggie style&quot; sequence comes to mind.\n\nYou know the acting in such an affair is bottom of the barrel amateurish when it&apos;s Friedman who comes closest to delivering a decent performance. All the same, it&apos;s giggle inducing when we see him try to emote at one point. The monster is hilariously awful looking; some viewers may perk up a little at the occasional female nudity, but those hoping for gore will be sorely disappointed as every kill happens offscreen. The ending is extremely underwhelming.\n\nIf you&apos;re a die hard aficionado of Bigfoot cinema, that&apos;s still no guarantee that you&apos;ll have a good time with this one. Proceed at your own risk.\n\nThree out of 10.",

He goes to the scuzziest places of Paris and Marseilles, asks for some names, beats up some people, gets the names, goes to more scuzzy places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc. The whole movie is punch after punch after punch. It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. Belmondo, who was 50 here, does perform some good stunts at the beginning; apart from those, &quot;Le Marginal&quot; is a violent, episodic, trite, shallow and forgettable cop movie. (*1/2)",

This is the second film by Jean-Paul Civeyrac that I have seen... What a beautiful cinema his is. So sensual and magical, so erotic and lyrical and ghostly... Also, economical in every way. Just one hour and it says as much or more than many films that last hours and hours... Highly recommended.",

She made her film debut the year before in Supergirl and it was a film everyone made fun of. I don&apos;t think thats fair to her, because she is a fine actress and proves it here. Unlike James Dean&apos;s character, she does &quot;have the right to be angry&quot; and fights back against a corrupt system. Some people may say this film condones vigilante activities, but I think this is a film with a positive message. I also loved Pat Benetar&apos;s song &quot;We Will Be Invincible&quot;, it should have gotten an Oscar."

      "reviewBody": "Holy Motors must be the strangest, maddest and most bizarre film I&apos;ve seen since at least Love Exposure and possibly ever. In a statement about the nature of both acting and the digitalisation of the world, Leos Carax&apos;s film stars Denis Lavant as a man who travels through Paris in a white limousine that is driven by Edith Scob. Along the way he stops for various &apos;appointments&apos; for which he adopts an entirely different character complete with makeup, mannerisms and speech. Throughout the course of the day he becomes a beggar woman, motion capture artist, assassin, disappointed father plus many more.\n\nThe film&apos;s message or statement is open for interpretation and after telling my girlfriend what I though I asked her the same, to which she replied &quot;I thought it was about weird stuff&quot;. The film is enjoyable however you view it and whether or not you read into any hidden messages or not. The themes that I personally believe the film is tackling may be totally different to the person next to me but it doesn&apos;t matter. Holy Motors is a thrilling, darkly comic and bonkers film that is worth tracking down.\n\nDue to the film&apos;s premise, subject matter and country or origin, we got the chance to travel to our local Art House Cinema, Cornerhouse in Manchester. We saw the film in their small room which contains just 58 seats but when the lights went down the cinema was full. After an ominously bizarre opening we see Denis Lavant leave his seemingly loving family and mansion behind and head for a waiting limousine. If this were any other film you&apos;d likely expect he was a businessman or some sort but it isn&apos;t long before his driver takes him to his first &apos;appointment&apos;. Before this opening appointment the camera swoops around to show the remainder of the limousines&apos; interior which instead of being filled with sofas, TVs and fridges is stocked with all manner of props, wigs and makeup cases. In no time Lavant is transformed into his first character, an old beggar woman of the sort you see around The Eiffel Tower. After several minutes of being ignored on the street he is back in the limo and off to his next appointment. The second and third appointments are for me the highlights of the film. One is an incredibly beautiful look at motion capture, shot in a darkened room with UV light and features incredible visuals, choreography and the most contorted woman I&apos;ve ever seen. The third is the strangest and funniest vignette and sees Lavant dressed as a sort of tramp/Quasimodo figure and having interrupted a fashion shoot, steals the model before taking her to his underground lair. The film reaches a crescendo at this point which it is never really able to match. At the time I thought to myself &quot;I&apos;m looking at Eva Mendes dressed in a Burqa, singing a lullaby to a naked man with an obvious and exposed erection. Where can they go from here?&quot; The answer is that they reel the film in slightly and take the audience to more emotional and heartfelt places.\n\nDenis Lavant&apos;s performance in this film is simply incredible. I haven&apos;t seen a better acting job this year and I&apos;d be surprised if I do. If the film wasn&apos;t so strange and commercially off-putting he would be a shoe-in for the major awards next February. Even so I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised to see an Oscar nomination if the Academy is feeling brave. Lavant literally transforms himself about nine or ten times, playing totally different characters each time. It&apos;s not just the sheer number that is impressive though, it is the quality of the performances which really stands out. He is truly awe inspiring in this film.\n\nThe film&apos;s message and themes are as I&apos;ve mentioned open to interpretation. Personally it felt to me like a satire on the nature of acting and how these days with the likes of camera phones and CCTV an actor can never switch off. We don&apos;t know who is watching so we are always performing. Equally it could be interpreted as stating that we show different sides of ourselves to different people. I know that I&apos;m a totally different person with my girlfriend as I am with the people at work for instance. It seems likely that the film is trying to talk about a variety of issues and themes and perhaps other people will pick up on different aspects of the strange world that it creates. That and Lavant&apos;s performance are its two major strengths.\n\nSome people will inevitably be put off by Holy Motors premise, style and quirkiness but if you stick with it and allow it to wash over you it&apos;s a brilliantly weird film that will be popping up on lots of Top 10 lists come December.\n\nwww.attheback.blogspot.com",

I am not sure if this was some kind of weird Titanic tie in where the studio thought anything with a big boat was a sure fire hit? This is one of the better attempts. Its a non-stop action movie which has some real gore, frights, surprises and humour thrown in. Its simply impossible not to be entertained by this. The story is a basic monster hunting down the crew scenario but its done well enough that you have no idea who is next on the menu and it also holds back on the reveal of whats attacking the crew, till well around the halfway of the movie. There are a couple of well know B movie actors in this and its very much B movie fodder, some of the FX in terms of CGI look dated now but some of the models look fantastic. The movie borrows heavily from a number of major action franchises but it doesn&apos;t detract from the fun. There are plenty of entertaining death scenes and some which were quite unique and effective. Not sure how I missed this in the past but its highly recommended for a fun action flick. Just be kind on on CGI it was 1998.",

      "reviewBody": "The film features solid performances of several famous German (and Austrian, in the case of Nadja Tiller) actors and actresses. Of course, it is somewhat dated in its plot development and some of the actors deliver their lines theater-like (a problem that can often be seen in German movies).  Still, the characters are interesting and even the Third Reich is not being swept under the carpet as so many German films of these days preferred to do. The hotel itself was once considered the most modern one in Europe (bathtubs were filled with water so fast, that they had warning signs for guests not to move away from the bathroom). One of the later family members, Percy Adlon, became a famous German movie director and he also made an interesting documentary about the hotel, but for the cineasts, even this old-fashioned movie is worth watching.",

No film can faithfully capture any concert experience, however, this managed to document a Stones tour that was like no other. Although the sound on the DVD is not as bright as it should be in this digital age, the vibrant fluorescent colors throughout the film foreshadowed the god awful palette of the 80&apos;s.\n\nThe best thing about the film is the lingering shots that hold on a particular Stone during a song. Due to a bit of clumsiness, it is surprising to many that the legendary Hal Ashby directed this film. Unfortunately he was not healthy during this production and it shows in a harried final cut. \n\nThis film is really for true Stones fans only.",

      "name": "Sad  and depressing story of  13 very young women condemned without even a trace of evidence during the Spanish Civil War",
      "reviewBody": "Downbeat but enjoyable film with magnificent performances , specially by Pilar López De Ayala . Dramatic picture about the consequences of Spanish civil war , being realized with academicism and general coldness , but dealing with a dark fact during Spanish Civil War (1936-39) and post-war . Despite their innocence , thirteen young girls (Pilar López De Ayala , Verónica Sánchez , Gabriella Pession , Nadia De Santiago , Marta Etura , Bárbara Lennie , Teresa Hurtado De Ory , among others) were detained and condemned with no trace of proofs of any wrong doing . Accused for rebellion , they are subsequently condemned to Death Row and soon executed beginning of the postwar era . \n\n¨13 Rosas¨ results to be other of the innumerable stories to deal with dramatic deeds regarding the Civil War background , this time about thirteen totally normal young women were put in prison under made up charges of helping the rebellion against Francisco Franco dictatorship back in the 1940&apos;s , all of them unjustly accused and sentenced to death and executed shortly after the Spanish Civil War . A familiar theme about the global horrors of a fratricide war , impossible to forget to our cinema . Emilio Martínez Lázaro also writes the script and story along with Pedro Costa and Ignacio Martínez De Pisón , filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship , without leaving a trace the thought-provoking issues , in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement , and adding tears guaranteed . Including a spotless pictorial cinematography and a willingness almost perfect of the elements of each shot , every sequence and every space . The main problem has to face &quot;13 Rosas¨, beyond not being able to avoid falling into the politic pamphlet is precisely derived from the coldness of its staging , which eventually become monotonous over two hours of footage . Because the story needs a vibration more real than the one offered in this slow-moving and sometimes boring film . ¨13 Rosas¨ bears remarkable resemblance to ¨La Voz Dormida¨ or &quot;The voice asleep¨, with Inma Cuesta , María León , Ana Wagener being adapted from the novel by Dulce Chacón and directed by Benito Zambrano that entered the Spanish selection for Oscar . \n\nBut anyway , its is compensated with the great performances from great actresses playing the girls that suffered harsh questioning , they are : Pilar López De Ayala , Verónica Sánchez , Gabriella Pession , Marta Etura and Bárbara Lennie , interpreters who provided a considerable boost to the result ; all the players are wonderful . Emilio Martínez Lázaro is a great director of actors and the main players are complemented by a good cast of secondaries (Félix Gómez , Fran Perea , Enrico Lo Verso , Goya Toledo , José Manuel Cervino , Teresa Hurtado De Ory , Asier Etxeandia , among others) forming a powerful human group of women and men and all of them giving excellent interpretations .\n\nBesides , it packs a colorful and appropriate cinematography . Being well photographed by the notorious cameraman Jose Luis Alcaine . As the pic offers an evocative photography by Jose Luis Alcaine who was first cinematographer to use fluorescent tube as &quot;key&quot; lightning and deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen . Alcaine frequently works with Pedro Almodóvar , Bigas Luna and Vicente Aranda , as he has photographed ¨The skin I live in¨ , ¨The bad education¨ , ¨Volver¨ , ¨Women in the verge of a nervous breakdown¨ , among others . Sensitive as well as adequate musical score by Roque Baños . Roque has composed excellent scores , he has made a prestigious career , as National : ¨800 bullets¨ , ¨Fragiles¨ , ¨Celda 211¨ , as International : ¨In the heart of the sea¨, ¨Cantinflas¨, ¨Old boy¨ , ¨Evil Dead¨ , ¨Machinist¨, ¨Sexy beast¨. This film was well directed by Emilio Martínez Lázaro . He was born in 1945 in Madrid , location in which he often shoots his films . He is a Spanish prestigious cinema director . Emilio is a director and writer, a good filmmaker expert on comedies as he has proved in : Los Peores Años De Nuestra Vida (1994) , El Juego Más Divertido (1998) and Amo Tu Cama Rica (1992) , drama : Las 13 Rosas (2007) La Voz De Su Amo (2001) , Musical as : Al Otro Lado De La Cama (2002) , Los Dos Lados De La Cama (2005) , among others . And , of course , his greatest successes : Ocho Apellidos Catalanes and Ocho Apellidos Vascos .",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sherman&apos;s March&quot; has some outstanding moments that capture the difficulties of relationships, but the lengthiness and lack of focus make it difficult to praise. The overall structure of the film is a clever look at the unpredictability of an artist&apos;s focus, in that filmmaker Ross McElwee set out to make a documentary about the Savannah Campaign and ended up making a film about his failed relationships. But McElwee&apos;s free-form approach to storytelling is the sole cause of the films only major flaw; at a whopping 157 minutes, it&apos;s padded with excessively long shots and pointless detours, including several attempts to find Burt Reynolds. It&apos;s impossible to become fully absorbed in the story when the subject repeatedly shifts from history lesson to love triangle to stalking celebrities. Ultimately, this film is worth viewing for its glimpses into the human condition and the interesting characters that enrich McElwee&apos;s travels (I especially like Charleen). However, much like the filmmaker, you may need to distract yourself periodically to make it to the end of this exhausting reflexive journey.",

Both these gorgeous hotties appear topless! And there are many wonderful actors in small roles, including three of the greatest character-actors of the time: Robert Davi, Ed O&apos;Ross, and Nicholas Worth, the terrifying, rubbery-lipped basso who plays Dellaplane&apos;s butler.\n\nThe screenplay is totally brain-free, written for stoned teenagers. (In this universe, it&apos;s EASY to break a heroin-habit!) But the action is hot, the women are sexy, the music is ultra-hip, and the villains are creepy. \n\nGreat fun. Royal fun.",

But, perhaps the circumstances of my initial viewing overly influenced my opinion.  On a business trip to DC in 1998, I saw &quot;The Game&quot; with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn on the way out... great movie, but very heavy and deep.  However on the way back, this movie was playing.  Based on initial reviews I wasn&apos;t expecting much, but watching it was like someone purposely made a funny version of The Game, and I probably annoyed my fellow passengers as I was laughing so hard.  I thought Murray was at his best, not unlike Chevy Chase in the Fletch movies (shame they didn&apos;t make more of those), as they were both in their comical element.\n\nThe coincidental (or perhaps not) pairing of these two films really added to my enjoyment of both.  On a cold rainy weekend, I strongly recommend renting both and watching them in the same order I did you won&apos;t be disappointed!",

Doubtless it was intended to show how well organized the Air Corp was. To me it simply indicates that if there had been a major invasion, the Axis would have been in Omaha before anyone got through polishing his brass.",

In Austria they probably would not get any, so they have to travel to Kenya. Kenyan are so poor that it is a way to make some money. It is business! Sex tourism! There is so much of it today all over the world. Sad and funny and heartwarming at the same time.\n\nIf you want a little bit break from Hollywood, please watch this.",

As long as we are not hurting little kids, raping,murdering those who are not into this then there is no big deal. Sticks and stones might break my bones BUT Whips, chains, and Bondage excite me.

The calm menace of Light is portrayed perfectly, with a clear distinction between Light and &quot;Kira&quot; Light, which is impressive considering anime would allow stronger visual cues. L is an honest to god incarnation of his manga and anime counter part down to the smallest detail. Ryuk is also impressive, the CGI effects do him justice and his voice is much better then the one for the subbed anime which was horrendous.\n\nNow obviously the plot needed to be condensed and changed but they did very well. All the important parts are there and the ending, which strays far from the manga, is actually even better then what actually happened in that instance in the story. It wasn&apos;t conveyed the complex story involving a genius highschool student who&apos;s use of a notebook that kills people that get&apos;s him involved in a proverbial chess match with the detective L, but they did a fine job. Misa, despite her short screen time, acted the part of Misa perfectly, down to the voice.\n\nFans of the manga should enjoy as long as they don&apos;t expect an exact replica of the manga, and fans of thrillers should enjoy this as well.\n\n9.5/10",

Well, I think that at the time of part 3 (1958) no one had the slightest notion that in the 70&apos;s the German mainstream cinema would be thàt in decline and thàt desperate that the producer and the director only could think of a follow-up on 50&apos;s material. Because that what this film is: a 50&apos;s film made in the 70&apos;s.\n\nThe makers did not even bother to come up with some new ideas to the standard format: again an elderly veterinary courting the elderly lady of Immenhof. In fact there is hardly a story at all. The makers also do not bother to explain why the Immenhof is not the same house anymore.\n\nOriginal cast member of the first three parts Heidi Brühl can be seen as the owner; she and the twin sisters (nice girls) make it at least bearable.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve only seen three of Andre Techine&apos;s films (&quot;Rendez-Vous,&quot; &quot;Scene of the Crime,&quot; and &quot;Wild Reeds&quot;) but after watching &quot;Wild Reeds&quot; I knew I&apos;d have to watch everything else he&apos;d ever made, for now I was a life-long fan.\n\n&quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; has many of the virtues of &quot;Wild Reeds,&quot;--a film that will inhabit you for weeks after you&apos;ve seen it--chief among them Techine&apos;s intelligence and sensitive handling of character and  flair for melodrama. If Thomas Hardy were alive today, he&apos;d probably be Techine&apos;s script-writer.\n\nThe film&apos;s two concerns are repression and freedom. Thomas--a sullen angry 13 year old--and Lili--his dreamy, distractedly neurotic mother-- undergo several collisions and unions with a young escaped convict and his friends: they are left to pick up the pieces and reconfigure their lives. Both mother and son are bound by a repressions whose roots are in family, community and religion. And each conflict with others binds them like a rope, so that Thomas futilely lashes out in anger while Lili attempts to lose (and in doing so) find herself with an act of impulsive negation. We could trace much of the repression toward the less likable characters--other criminals or family members--but doing so is futile. Techine understands what Renoir meant when said &quot;everyone has his reasons,&quot; and so this film isn&apos;t about the difficulty of living with other people, but the difficulty of living in this universe.\n\nTechine has often been called a &quot;novelistic&quot; director; meaning he takes you deep inside his characters&apos; thoughts and motivations. This doesn&apos;t involve voiceover, just Techine&apos;s direction and the melodramatic plots that force their characters into confrontations ordained by the strength of their passions. Melodrama asks the most of its characters; requires them to feel and undergo all they can. It&apos;s numerous coincidences, and run-ins can seem like an amplified version of life&apos;s randomness and havoc. Techine&apos;s approach involves an analytical acceptance of melodrama&apos;s approach to narrative; a willing and measured use of its conventions, resulting in narratives that often seem more vivid than reality and paradoxically more truthful and satisfying. The emotions unearthed are more intense than those brought out by reality, but possess the inner truth of reality.\n\nHis technique is not flashy, attention-getting or hyper-formalistic: which means it works discreetly and extremely well. There is an ever-present analytical attention to the natural (and un-) surroundings that surround his characters, along with an intense intimacy toward them. He follows very few rules, and mixes quick cutting with measured long takes and a mobile camera. All this allows us to move back and forth and toward and away from his characters, sympathizing with them in close-up one moment, then judging at a detached angle or pan to another character&apos;s reaction. It is a wonderfully effective method, and constantly reminds us of each character&apos;s motivations (as do the relentless melodramatics.)\n\nTechine&apos;s films aren&apos;t formally difficult, but if you lose track at one point it&apos;s hard to catch up, because his characters will have accumulated even more motivations and reactions by then. The intense sensitivity of his style allows us to accurately register each character&apos;s accumulating layer of emotions, which continually enlarge their motivations. To lose track of that accumulative process is probably what happened to Roger Ebert, who wrote the film should have been a gangster drama made in 1939, so that the melodramatic plot would seem more acceptable and Techine&apos;s moments of psychological insights wouldn&apos;t seem so &quot;out of place.&quot; (The film IS primarily flawed in the sketchiness of the convict&apos;s lover and the overly-rushed pace of the climactic sequence.)He doesn&apos;t consider that the melodrama of the plot is precisely what allows for those moments of psychological insight. And desire for the film to be an old-fashioned crime noir seems inexplicable, when this is obviously a family drama where crime serves to provoke a shake-up and re-evaluation of family relations and the life-directions the characters have chosen. At the end of &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; we&apos;re not sure whether Thomas and Lili have either recovered or damaged forever. And as Lili hauntingly remarks, after a certain point, losing and finding yourself may be the same process."

      "reviewBody": "Like we&apos;ve taken the Robin Hood legend and changed the bows and arrows to machine guns! ... Like with songs yet! ... Like WILD! . In prohibition-era from 1920s Chicago, the racketeer marshal (Victor Buono) along with a mobster named Guy Gisborne , a corrupt(Peter Falk) who controls the south side , knock off the ringleader Big Jim (Edward G Robinson). Everyone falls in line behind Guy except the do-good gangster Robbo (Frank Sinatra) who rules north side in his last go-round . Robbo wishes to keep his own territory with a ¨Robbo project foundation¨ and his particular business . A pool-playing man from Indiana named Little John (Dean Martin)and the director of a boys&apos; orphanage named Alen Dale (Bing Crosby) unite forces with Robbo and Will (Sammy Davis Jr). When he gives some money to the orphanage, he turns the toast of the town as a hood like Robin Hood and people shout ¨Chicago loves Robin¨. As Robbo along with his friends creates the ¨Robin Hood foundation¨ and a ¨Free soup kitchen¨ . Meanwhile, Guy schemes to get rid of Robbo, and Big Jim&apos;s heretofore unknown daughter named Marian (Barbara Rush) turns up and goes after from dudes attempting to encounter an ally in her quest to run the whole show. Later on , Robbo is detained and newspapers publicize : Robbo held for sheriff murder¨ .\n\nThis is an amusing musical comedy with some Hollywood major stars reunited by Frank ¨Robbo¨ Sinatra and incarnating Robin and his merry men in modern times , including usual names as Little John , Will Scarlett , Marian and Guy Gisborne . It&apos;s a ¨Rat Pack¨ version of 1920&apos;s Chicago with Frank Sinatra and his boys as do-good mobsters in their last outing . Fine musical numbers with beautiful songs by Nelson Riddle as ¨Bang, Bang¨ , ¨Mister Booze¨, ¨Don&apos;t be a do-baddler¨ and ¨My kind of town¨ with Dean Martin, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra singing and dancing and dressed in smoking , besides another sensational show including Crosby dancing with children . This is a typical Rat Pack vehicle such as ¨ Ocean&apos;s eleven(1960) ¨, ¨ Four for Texas (63)¨ and finally ¨Cannoball run II (1984)¨ with the sympathetic trio Frank Sinatra-Sammy Davis Jr-Dean Martin . The motion picture is professionally constructed by Gordon Douglas. This is one of various and mediocre works of his long career as filmmaker. He was a Hollywood veteran director, directing early movies (Little rascals, Spanky), expert on Western (Chuka,Rio Conchos, Yellowstone Kelly, Only the valiant ), and usually worked for Frank Sinatra in various films (Lady in Cement, Tony Rome,The detective, Robin and the 7 Hoods). Rating : Passable and acceptable , 5,5 . This is a nice musical entertainment and to be liked for Frank Sinatra fans.",

Don&apos;t just hint to Nate&apos;s queerness, or don&apos;t just show his only interaction to a lgbtq couple (and that too is just alluded to) is to ask for directions! The movie on its own is great, the fact that disney kept dropping hints of the character possibily being gay but not just outright saying it, says alot about them. They still need to make this movie profitable, so they&apos;ll hint to it, but never outright admit it.",

Sadly it lacked the impetus of the original&apos;s theme-as-action. It has some very impressive stunts and it never fails to look busy, but the story is crammed with too many action events. The dialogue is clichéd and the characterization is thin, and the plot devices are overfamiliar. Jason Patric fails to impose himself as the lead which left Sandra Bullock who was sidelined into producing a frenetic character which she ends up overworking. Willem Dafoe looks the part but he acts tough without seeming tough. All in all, it&apos;s action packed but froths over. The finale does justify sticking with it because back in 1997 it was the most expensive stunt ever filmed.",

      "reviewBody": "The head of the Carolingian order is killed and one of the last members is called to investigate the death. The Carolingians fight demons, apparitions and perform exorcisms. Can he stop a murderer who is not human?\n\nApparently all that is required to banish the most powerful denizens of hell is a small wooden Crucifix and the Chant&apos;.I order you back to Hell!&apos; Well I order you to save your ten dollars. Ledger, Sossamon and even Addy are not the problem in this film.  The borderline special effects are also not the problem in this film. The problem is this film&apos;s trailer (the preview for the film) that promises a horror thriller with a mysterious supernatural killer, involving rogue priests. The problem is the trailer writes checks that the plot can&apos;t cash.  Now I know we have enough rogue priests in our regular everyday life, but these rogue priests have cool black crucifix tattooed on their legs.  The entire cast which, seems to be little more than a Knight&apos;s Tale reunion all turn in great performances. The first Forty-five minutes make me think of Stigmata with a taste of The Exorcist.  After that it becomes boring, predictable and criminally unimaginative.  Not only is it not scary or suspenseful after that, but it wastes what was shapping up to be a fine plot.  Originally scheduled to release Jan 17, 2002 it was postponed to redo the special effects, maybe the plot should have received a rework as well.\n\nThough not big box office fare, the special effects weren&apos;t completely horrible. The sets were actually very nice and I liked St. Peters in particular.  Maybe a Hollywood clone would do the justice that this movie couldn&apos;t, or even a direct to video movie about the Carolingians in which we pretend the first movie didn&apos;t even exist."

The short film is a slow-burner at first, but then quickly unveils a mysterious encounter that draws you in.\n\nWhile many things are done well, the plot becomes muddled at the end. Character intentions aren&apos;t fully explained by the dialogue and scenes in the film and it transitions from a unique and original plot, to a more Hollywood style battle between the hero and the one-dimensional and unbelievable villain. The film would have benefitted from more multi-dimensional characters and more ambiguous morality of key characters. Had philosophical questions replaced the more action-oriented scenes at the end, this could have been a good film.",

At least there is very little padding scenes and the main story and action starts pretty much right away which makes a nice change for these budget films.\n\nAnd whilst the CGI effects are pretty standard for these budget films these days they still put quite some efforts into showing as much CGI destruction scenes as you would expect in any major disaster film. Which for a budget film was great to see instead of the CGI action light scenes and a more claustrophobic feel you can find in cheap disaster film. You at least get a scale of size with this films.\n\nCGI, whilst quite regular and fairly big scale, they could have tried using more finer particle effects in falling buildings and debris than they did. As it would have given a far great element to detail and realism to many destruction scenes. As I often felt it was almost like watching partially SD effects on HD footage such was the lack of fine detail in some of the CGI effects.\n\nActing was fairly good, if standard, and the overall story passable. Overall an acceptable TV disaster film that&apos;s worth a good 5/10 for me.",

The film can be viewed from a dual perspective as it shows how an athlete is running for his personal growth. From a different perspective, it also shows how an athlete is made to run for the greater glory of his country. The athlete is surrounded by officials who are around him at all major points. They are also around in case somebody decides to take part in a sporting event. As per this documentary film, viewers get to see how one runs for a long duration. Lastly, Gyula Gazdag also shows the athlete in question running during the night and the day.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fine movie--the sort of nice old fashioned film that Hollywood did so well decades ago. A delightful script, excellent acting, along with beautiful sets and deft direction make this simple movie stand up so well even today.\n\nCary Grant plays an angel that comes to assist the extremely controlling and obsessed Bishop, played by David Niven. While Niven prayed for divine help, he struggled throughout the film with accepting the help on anything but his own terms. He soon learns of Grant&apos;s mission, but others are unaware of his Heavenly origins. Grant plays his angelic role in a very deliberately paced and casual manner--almost like combining TV&apos;s Mister Rogers with the usual Grant persona! In addition to these two wonderful actors, the film also features Loretta Young, Monty Woolley, James Gleason, Elsa Lanchester and Gladys Cooper. All did a great job of providing color and support in the film.\n\nPerhaps the biggest star of this film, though, were the sets, cinematography and direction. They created a really nostalgic sense to the film that seemed almost better than real life. The snow, the frozen pond and all the other aspects of the film just set the perfect mood. About the only negative at all (and it&apos;s a small one) is the skating sequence. While it was nice to see Grant and Young really ice skating in the beginning, using doubles for them as well as James Gleason wasn&apos;t very seamless. Having these doubles skating with darkened faces just seemed pretty cheesy but forgivable.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a nice fantasy film that should be enjoyed by most anyone except the most cynical viewers.",

While I finally understood the actual storyline by the end I think the only thing that really came across (and by no virtue of the terrible acting) was what my already somewhat fan-girl mind had conjured up at the beginning wasn&apos;t far from the mark.\n\nWith the CGI, scenery, acting and plot coherency the only thing that buoyed this rating up was Susumu, and perhaps the end.",

      "name": "Saat Hindustani: Amitabh Bachchan and beyond!",
      "reviewBody": "The whole of India would recognize Saat Hindustaani (1969) as the debut film of Amitabh Bachchan. But beyond that hardly anyone would know anything about the movie in terms of its cast, story, setting, etc because most of them (including hardcore Amitabh Bachchan fans) might have never seen this film. Though each and every film of Amitabh Bachchan repeatedly keeps playing on TV channels, I have never come across this film on the small screen ever. So had to rent a VCD which was marred by bad print and sound quality. However it conveyed the spirit of the film.\n\nThis is the one and only film of Amitabh Bachchan in Black and White. From more than 30+ films that Khwaja Ahmed Abbas directed in his career, this is the only one that got him popularity and remains tagged with his name till date. Its common knowledge how classic Westerners like &apos;The Magnificent Seven&apos; or the Japanese film &apos;Seven Samurai&apos; were inspirations behind Amitabh Bachchan starrer Sholay. However even &apos;Saat Hindustani&apos; (Seven Indians) had traces of those films in terms of seven diverse individuals coming together to free people from foreign rule. Allegedly Saat Hindustani is loosely derived from Hollywood flick &apos;For Whom The Bell Tolls&apos;(1943).\n\nBeyond Amitabh Bachchan, the film had a lot to offer. There was an array of assorted actors and each of them, barring Utpal Dutt, were almost first timers. Utpal Dutt was the only established actor in the star cast. Saat Hindustani was a social war drama with lot of action and adventure stuffed in. It had a strong social message to convey – about national integration in a country separated by religion, caste, language and social status.\n\nThe story is about a Goan girl Maria (Shenaaz) who, on her death bed, sends postal invitations to all her revolutionary colleagues who once came together to free Goa from the Portugal rule. All of Maria&apos;s six teammates are introduced in present times. Ex-army-man Joginder Nath (Utpal Dutt) is unhappy with the partition of Punjab state. The fields that he ploughed in Punjab in morning ended up being in Haryana in the evening following the divide. Tamalian Mahadevan (Irshad Ali) who once endorsed the national language Hindi in Madras, now hates the language with changing times. He is also a harijan – meaning a person from the lower caste. Anwar Ali (Amitabh Bachchan) is an Urdu poet who believes that Hindi is too complicated. His house is burnt down as a result of the Hindi-Urdu feud. Ram Bhagat Sharma (Anwar Ali) propagates through his newspaper that anyone who doesn&apos;t support Hindi in the North Eastern (Hindi-dominated) belt will face dire consequences. Sakharam Shinde (Jalal Agha), a wandering theatre artist, hails from Maharashta where several boundary districts like Belgaum and Bidar are fighting to be integrated with the Maharashta state. (Since then till present day, Belgaum city on the Maharashtra-Karnataka boundary is still making headlines over which state it should integrate with – which makes one wonder how the issues in India have continued for decades and are still pertinent). Lastly Shabut Sanyal (Madhu) comes from Bengal.\n\nAnd to think of it, all these six individuals who presently have caste, creed or racial differences, once came together to fight the Portuguese and free Goa from their rule. Goa, then, had similar conflicts like Kashmir has today. Locals from Goa had a feeling that though it was a part of India, the Indian government didn&apos;t consider them equal and fight for their rights or freedom. That&apos;s when these Seven Indians (Saat Hindustani), including Maria come together, undergo physical training and get set on a mission to host seven flags at seven prominent police stations or monuments in Goa.\n\nThe beauty of director K.A.Abbas&apos; casting was that he made each actor play a character against his real-life region or religion. So the Bengali Utpal Dutt played a Punjabi in the film, while Malayalee actor Madhu played a Bengali character. Muslim actors Irshad Ali and Jalal Agha played South Indian and Maharashtrian characters convincingly and so did Muslim actress Shenaaz, compellingly pulling off a Christian character. Son of Hindu poet Amitabh Bachchan played a Muslim shayar, while Muslim actor Anwar Ali played a staunch Hindu (Bachchan also took his character name from Anwar Ali). Through such a casting, the director gave a subtle message on tolerance for other communities with national integration being the bigger picture.\n\nThe performances, not just by Amitabh Bachchan, but even other actors like Utpal Dutt and Jalal Agha were brilliant. Shenaaz reminds of Zeenat Aman in several frames. Madhu was low on screen presence and took a backseat. Amitabh Bachchan who went on to become the biggest superstar of Hindi cinema, which he is even today, won a National Award in this debut film of his. Saat Hindustani also won the Best Film (K.A.Abbas) and Best Lyrics (Kaifi Azmi) Award for National Integration.\n\nThe pace gets slow at times but otherwise, Saat Hindustani is an entertaining action-adventure-social-war drama. Watch it even today and you won&apos;t be disappointed. Because not much has changed in the country since then!\n\n\n* Gaurav Malani\n",

It is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don&apos;t use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.\n\nYou can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.",

      "reviewBody": "Not far from directors like Elio Petri or Francesco Rosi, Mario Camus tells a story of growing social awareness when killer Marco comes to town, paid to shoot a man who wants to start a revolution. Watching his boss Don Antonio suppressing the working class, Marco soon regrets what he has done and joins the revolution. For the sake of drama, there is a beautiful lady to fall in love with and a brother who does not understand his change of motivation. It may not be extraordinary for 1970, but surely is a solid early work of its director.\n\nThe Spanish original title &quot;La colera del viento&quot; means &quot;The Wrath of the Wind&quot;, and as Don Lucas quotes the biblical &quot;For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind&quot; (Hosea 8,7) in the dialog, the connexion seems clear. However, in most countries, the distributors preferred titles similar to the successful &quot;Trinita&quot; comedies with Terence Hill, e.g. &quot;Trinity Sees Red&quot;, even though &quot;La colera del viento&quot; is hardly intended for the same audience. The restored Spanish version for DVD runs 102 minutes instead of 93 like the old cinema print, which apparently was no censorship issue, merely a few dialog scenes which had been shortened. I personally didn&apos;t feel the film was too slow moving, it gives time to breathe and time to think. If you like watching Terence Hill in serious films, try &quot;Il vero e il falso&quot; by Eriprando Visconti next.",

Although the film takes place on a tropic island, a few similarities to `Alien&apos; are obvious, down to the fact that the heroine has to stand the last fight with the creature wearing nothing but her white underwear. No, I don&apos;t complain about that ;-) Anyway, the huge creature which can move under the ground is quite scary (but only until it stands up and suddenly looks like a cross between a senile robot and a lunatic crab), the characters (including a snake hunter, Greenpeace investigators, a not-yet-mad scientist and an unscrupulous officer trying to `control&apos; the situation) help to develop an interesting storyline, and I cannot agree with reviewers who consider this a simple rip-off. There is a lot more to see, `Alien degli abissi&apos; is not too bad entertainment from an experienced director (voted 6/10).",

Overall the movie is a comedy with some action in it! This is not a gangster movie! There is no real plot concerning gangs and their politics! It is about the daughter of a Chinese gangster who is accused of murdering another gangster! She has to hide in Korea under the protection of a business partner of the father! Other than this fact it has nothing to do with gangsters! Shu Qi is excellent as the main character! She is beautiful and one bad ass chick! So is Lee Beom-su as Ku Chil (from &quot;City of violence)! He is quite the opposite from Shu Qi! The usual jokes about not understanding each other or wrong translation really gets tiresome! The subtle love story is nice and not annoying! There is just enough action to show that Shu Qi is not a girl to mess with! But satisfying it isn&apos;t! With the lack of real danger and tension the story is quite boring! In my opinion they should have put in more threatening action to compensate! Thanks to the performances of the actors this movie is quite amusing!",

It is an intriguing story, nicely filmed with interesting NYC locations (you will even see the former WTC towers in a few shots, which now seem poignant yet oddly sobering).\n\n I LOVE the performances: everyone comes across as quite compelling and convincing in their respective roles. (The only part that didn&apos;t work for me was when Tom Hank&apos;s character goes a little wacko with that shotgun in his apartment, but I guess I can forgive that minor deviation.)\n\nThe story seems very much like a fable... and it brings to mind the old saying that every fable has its grain of truth.\n\nGo see it. It&apos;s better than critics would have you believe. (I haven&apos;t read the book, but I intend to shortly)."

      "reviewBody": "Jim Morrison wrote many of the Doors songs and was a complete drunk by the time he died in 1971. This film depicts Morrison in a very one sided view. Yes he was an alcoholic with a disregard for authority, yes he was on self destruct mode and burnt out quickly reaffirming the James Dean &quot;Live fast Die young&quot; motif. But what is missing from Stone&apos;s depiction of him was his great intellect,his absurd humour and his natural talent as a composer and vocalist. However it is a wonderfully visual film that takes the viewers on a hallucinogenic ride through drug hazed Los Angeles in the late 60&apos;s. It was the first of many films that Stone created in the 90&apos;s using an almost dream like quality to evoke the feeling of the turbulent times.\n\nAlthough this picture is not a 100% accurate account of who or what Jim Morrison was it is still very engaging and enjoyable. A good place for someone who is new to the Doors to start.",

      "reviewBody": "DIRK BOGARDE gives one of his more restrained performances in the title role, a man whose friendship with a young boy (JON WHITELEY) drives a wedge between the boy and his over-protective father (MICHAEL HORDERN). It&apos;s the interplay between these three characters that drives the story and there are some melodramatic events before the happy ending.\n\nBut it takes its time in developing the characterizations, sags in the middle and then picks up again during the last half-hour when all the melodramatic conflicts have to be resolved.\n\nUnfortunately, the TCM print shows murky color photography (especially after showing a dazzling print of BLACK NARCISSUS). Whether the film was shot in a process other than the usual British color I don&apos;t know, but the color photography was sometimes less than satisfying.\n\nThe story is one of friendship that the boy so badly needs when his father has too little time to share many activities with him. The bond between him and the Spanish gardener is based on mutual trust and the boy comes to hate his father when he realizes that he&apos;s been the cause of the man being jailed for a crime he didn&apos;t commit.\n\nJON WHITELEY gives a remarkably natural performance for a child actor and his scenes with DIRK BOGARDE and MICHAEL HORDERN are excellently played.\n\nThere are problems of pacing that plague some parts of the film, but the last half is particularly absorbing and leads to a satisfying conclusion. Well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "A strong, layered second film by Julie Bertocelli, one which probably deserves more recognition that it has been given by most critics. I found it difficult to take my eyes off of Charlotte Gainsbourg, who gave a sensitive and complex portrayal of a woman grieving her husband&apos;s passing. While the film may have been compared to WALKABOUT, given the cinematic opportunities of the outback, the spiritual nature of the environment paves way for specific beautiful and endearing unexpected visual delights which compliment the narrative in obvious ways, but perhaps not offensively so. The film is quite focused. It is kept simple and unfolds nicely. I found it much more pleasing to sit through than TREE OF LIFE. Bertocelli&apos;s film is much more tightly woven and traditional in form, not necessarily any less authentic or profound. Moments were delightful, not excruciatingly painful in the sense of wallowing, allowing the occasional irritation from the daughter to seep into the point where you just want Dawn to slap her across the face. May make more of an interesting comparison the that tree scene in Poltergeist or the horror film about the WOODS. Definitely underrated on here, a film well worth checking out."

When one watches an old film the script of which was co-written by Billy Wilder one can expect something that is, above all, extremely funny and a pleasure to watch. Regarding this musical, my expectations were disappointed.\n\nTwo window-cleaners with identical first names, one decent, the other more impulsive, compete in achieving the favour of a young girl, who dreams of being an actress in Hollywood. That&apos;s the story, and as trivial as the story are the songs the characters suddenly break out singing. Moreover, the songs are also boring and schmaltzy rather than fast and funny. The same is true for the dialogues and the whole plot. The `comedy&apos; part in the description `musical comedy&apos; comes off badly.\n\nThe glorious Paul Hörbiger plays a part that offers him no chance to shine but forces him to hide his Austrian accent and say lines like `So ein Quatsch!&apos;. Why on earth did he accept this role? Lilian Harvey, on the other hand, portrays the untalented artist with slightly too much effort. When she jumps around hysterically, we really want her to stay at home and cook.\n\nBy the way, it is not my misogynous opinion I&apos;m expressing here but the tone of the film. Obviously, a touch of nazism slipped into the story at a time when the ideology was already present. Just pay attention to the `happy&apos;-end of the film and to the title: `A Blonde Dream&apos;. From this point of view, of course, the movie can act as an interesting piece of history. But for Sunday afternoon entertainment, it is much too dull.",

      "reviewBody": "An Evening in Paris (1967) : Brief Review -\n\nA fairly entertaining romantic masala thriller set in beautiful locations in Paris. This is not a typical Shakti Samantha film, to be frank. Samantha&apos;s An Evening in Paris started off by giving me the vibes of Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly&apos;s Oscar-winning &quot;American in Paris&quot; (1951) in the beginning, and I really enjoyed it for a while. An Indian girl, Deepa, sets off to find the love of her life in Paris after failing to find a perfect lover in India. She is approached by Sam, who introduces himself as a French man, and they fall in love. This entire romantic chase, flirting, and proposal thing is very cute. They look even cuter when you hear the songs. Who could have imagined a Bollywood film having a title song on Paris&apos; beauty, and who else can you think of but Shankar-Jaikishan? An Evening in Paris is such a beautiful song, and then there are &quot;Akele Akele Kahan Ja Rahe&quot; and &quot;Aasman Se Aaya Farishta,&quot; which turn out to be perfect romantic songs. Shammi Kapoor showing off his thigh, hanging on the helicopter, and saying, &quot;Kaho Pyar Hai Tumse&quot; (Mohammed Rafi&apos;s voice), and then Sharmila Tagore in Bikini ditching him, &quot;Jaa Jaa.&quot; So freaking adorable. What&apos;s more adorable is that he uses the same words at the end of the song, and she accepts the proposal, saying, &quot;Haa, haa, Kaha naa.&quot; You expect the film to go on with a typical masala ending after this, but there comes Samantha&apos;s thriller factor. We have a twin formula-a little conry, but okay. The scripting seemed half-baked here. The character of Rupa falls in love with Sam, and we have no clue. She suddenly turns into a good woman, and we are clueless again because the writer did not provide her with enough evolution. Charming and handsome Shammi Kapoor and super-sexy Sharmila Tagore take you on a lavish, romantic, and glamorous ride in Paris, and that&apos;s all the film is about. Too gorgeous for the time, maybe?\n\nRATING - 6/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

As a documentary, it achieves everything it should: it informs us, it moves us, and it reminds us of the evil that we Americans have in our past, and still have today. &quot;Never forget&quot;, indeed. It goes without saying that this was an awful act of hatred and bigotry, its impact still sharply felt by friends and family of the victims. There is one amusing moment: a clip of George Wallace, years after the fact, trotting out his black &quot;best friend&quot; for the world to see, and the man clearly has contempt for Wallace. Speaking of trotting out, however, I question the need for Bill Cosby to chime in, or Jesse Jackson for that matter. There are plenty of articulate and interesting interviewees already involved without pulling in a couple of celebrity pals. It pulled me out of the film for a moment. Other than that, however, a strong and memorable film.",

      "reviewBody": "Bud Spencer and Terence Hill are well known as a couple of tough guys, but also as an always loveable and truly relatable comedic duo. I love all of their movies, and in my view, this is the very best of the 15-20 (!) movies they made together.\n\nBrilliant, laid-back humor, light hearted but relatable, with a subtle undertone of social commentary (the tough, poor and streetwise characters vs their cowardly, overly anxious zillionaire counterparts).\n\nThe sarcastic jokes are also what make this one of their many great comedies my favourite. The absolute gem is when they are ready to have dinner when Tango (the bad guy) and his gang arrive and want to provoke a fight, when at one point which Hill&apos;s character says: &quot;The fact that he calls himself Tango in the land of Samba, tells us what a complete idiot he is.&quot; - and then, of course, the usual &quot;Spencer &amp; Hill vs 50 other guys&quot; fighting breaks out..... GOLD!\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of their movies, this is an absolute must see! If not, this is your best shot of becoming a fan for life. Great humor, pure unspoiled FUN. What more could we ask for from such a movie? 10/10, no question.",

      "reviewBody": "If you took a Leo Tolstoy class in college or read one of his works during your time at the library and wanted to know a bit more about the man, don&apos;t really look to The Last Station. Does that make it a poor film? Not by a long shot.\n\nThe film follows the story of Leo (Christopher Plummer) and Sofya Tolstoy (Helen Mirren), married couple for 43 years, and the battle that raged between them at the end of Leo&apos;s life. As Leo&apos;s health is ailing, his long time friend Vladimir Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) urges Leo to write a new will, renouncing his material possessions, leaving his wife and family with nothing. All of this is in order to have Leo&apos;s movement of peace to go to the majority. Chertkov sends a young follower of the Tolstoyan movement, Valentin Bulgakov, to investigate and inscribe all of Sofya&apos;s exaggerated and histrionic antics to work against her campaign.\n\nFirstly, the film is A-typical period piece with all the correct elements of that type of film. Art Direction by Mark Rosinski and Heike Wolf, stunning costume design by Monika Jacobs, and a score to die for by Sergei Yevtushenko is pitch perfect and exalted brilliance. Nothing is wrong with this film technically.\n\nAn extraordinary narrative beautifully adapted by the director Michael Hoffman is one of the crowning achievements of his career. Dedicating his all for the sake of the art form, Hoffman writes and directs the screen with meticulousness and accuracy. Playing that extra special detail to smooth out an rough edges paid off for Hoffman immensely.\n\nThe cast presented in The Last Station is stellar and one of the best cast ensembles of the 2009. James McAvoy, proving once again, that you don&apos;t just lay down the words of your acting, you let the spirit fight its way through your soul and remain a tangible entity for your audience to engage. McAvoy proves he&apos;s one of Hollywood&apos;s most outstanding talents. Helen Mirren, riding the see-saw with her viewers, never declares any type of emotion until the bitter end. Mirren shows no apparent ambiance of mood or expression. She sizzles through the film, igniting every scene on fire along the way. Christopher Plummer as the lovable Leo is amiable, captivating, and entrancing. Plummer, a talent long overdue for Oscar recognition is enticing. Paul Giamatti, in a more villainous role we haven&apos;t seen of him before, is always dependable and alluring. Anne-Marie Duff and Kerry Condon are both enthralling in their roles respectively.\n\nThe Last Station is a definite contender for a Best Picture nomination. It&apos;s a delightful film full of heart, love, and heartbreak. The temptation of the films aura will lure you in and surely leave you in tears.\n\n***½/****",

There is a fine performance from Tom Bosley, in his first major role as a clumsy fellow who tries to win Wood&apos;s heart.

      "reviewBody": "This is a silly little slapstick comedy, very typical for the kind which were quite popular in Germany from the mid 1950s to the early 1970s. Although they are now less fondly remembered, these films were quite similar in style and tone to the British Carry-On films, and I might add: also in quality.\n\nThis one here is below par, partly because most of the top-notch comedians in the cast (Willy Millowitsch, Ralf Wolter, Heinz Erhardt, Edith Hancke) only appear briefly in roles that are only remotely connected to the plot - &quot;pay the rent&quot; stuff, albeit well executed. Still, the main cast does a good job, with the exception of Terry Torday whose approach of playing an auditor I might politely describe as bizarre. What makes films like this nowadays less fashionable than their Carry-On cousins are the (compulsory) serious romantic subplots which now appear terribly dated.\n\nThere are signs that the film went into production before the script was finished, e.g. the name of the character played by Terry Torday, although central, isn&apos;t revealed to us until very very late in the movie. Up to then she&apos;s referred as &quot;a lady&quot;, or &quot;that terrible person&quot;. Christiane Ruecker&apos;s character didn&apos;t fare much better.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a low-budget, shot on video film about a group of teens who are sent into an abandoned, cursed meat-packing plant to take an inventory of its contents. The teens reawaken an Aztec-demon-possessed butcher who killed his coworkers 40 years ago (oops!) and are possessed and murdered one by one.\n\nThe good: nice location, reasonably well-lit, though more variation in the large empty rooms would have added to the film. For the most part the actors (especially the main teen in charge of the inventory) do a good job.\n\nThe bad: hammy butcher villain isn&apos;t scary, Aztec curse &quot;rules&quot; never really explained, little plot problems (characters screaming at one end of a basement aren&apos;t heard by other characters a few hallways/rooms away?), awkwardly handled nudity.\n\nYou&apos;ve got a ghost/demon that only appears to people who are just about to be killed, yet the film never really does anything special with that. The characters always wait/watch him close in on them and kill them, instead of, say, telling their friends where he&apos;s at in the room so they can help fight him off. Some scenes of the butcher menacing a teen (especially the final showdown) are ANNOYINGLY edited with lots of cuts. Eventually the scenes become boring.\n\nAfter watching the movie I was left with the feeling that it could have been so much more.",

Probably because of that, the title character is not as interesting as she could be; the men, whoever, are, probably more due to the great performances by Charles Boyer and the maverick director Vittorio de Sica. But any problems are forgivable due to the irreproachable costumes and art direction, the marvelous cinematography, and the very elaborate and rich camera work. It&apos;s the most beautiful film to look at that i have seen in a long time. Stanley Kubrick (like he said himself) owns much of his visual style to the German filmmaker. It&apos;s one of those unforgettable films, not because of the performers, or the plot, or the message, but the images; Vittorio de Sica and Danielle Darrieux dancing elegantly through the nights of Paris is one of the most remarkable moments in the history of cinema."

      "reviewBody": "Mallika (2010) is an Indian horror movie that I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline follows a young lady who is struggling with nightmares and decides to take a vacation at a resort to hopefully get some much needed rest. Unfortunately for her, her car breaks down on the way and the resort sends someone to scoop her up. She quickly gains the attention of a photographer and model that won&apos;t stop taking pictures of her or leave her alone. When she tries to get rest she keeps seeing a woman that looks like her getting murdered. How is it all tied together?\n\nThis movie is directed by Wilson Louis (Kaalo) and stars Sammir Dattani (I Hate Luv Stories), Mamik Singh (Bellbottom), Suresh Menon (Kaabil) and Rajesh Khera (Sense8 ).\n\nThis movie is bad with some comedic elements that helps the audience tolerate the mediocre content. The main character is gorgeous, the dialogue is funny and the settings are unique and not bad. The horror elements are very uneven - the ghosts scenes and makeup were okay and there were some people thrown that slide wildly across the floor that cracked me up. There&apos;s some awkward shower and bathing scenes where characters take them either in lingerie or workout outfits. Fully clothed shower scenes always crack me up and make me cringe at the same time. The camera angles and background music are a bit weird and the ending with the violin also cracked me up.\n\nOverall, this is a movie that isn&apos;t worth your time. I would score this a 2.5/10 and recommend skipping it.",

      "reviewBody": "Wiktor Grodecki is a brave filmmaker, one who is unafraid to address a controversial subject, yet one who is able to make a powerful sociological statement by creating a metaphorical art film that demands respect.\n\nGrodecki interviews young boys (ages 14 - 17) who are male hustlers in Prague: he wisely removes (for the most part) the interviewer questions allowing the individual boys to make spontaneous, searing comments. These young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes, how they deal with selling their bodies, where they find their business (the train station, the swimming pools, etc), how they feel about the johns and about their fellow hustlers, the manner in which they do business including the way in which the financial aspects come to play - all in a way that burns the faces of these young lads into our psyches.\n\nAbout half way through this film Grodecki introduces Pavel Rousek, a man who by day is a pathologist performing autopsies in the Prague morgue and in his off hours (using the pseudonym Hans Miller) creates, casts and directs gay porno videos in his home. Rousek is shown at the autopsy table gowning, gloving, and grotesquely performing an autopsy on a real cadaver while discussing both professions. There are moments while he is gloving that he explains why he doesn&apos;t allow his boys to wear condoms (the buyers of his videos don&apos;t want to see condoms), and the contrast between his self protection vs the enforcement of prevention of sexual protection of his actors is devastating.\n\nRousek as Miller is then shown filming the boys in his home, explaining the details of achieving the visual effects of pornography: simultaneously we again hear the boys views of that aspect of their &apos;careers&apos;, creating a pitiful tension. There is almost no total nudity in this film and when it does occur the lighting is so dark as to obscure it - making the overall effect even more dense and effectively tense. Under all of this lurid talk Grodecki uses classical music - Albinoni, Mahler, Mozart - which again provides a contradiction that makes the topic digestible.\n\nThe final question Grodecki poses to his subjects involves the boys perception of &apos;soul&apos; and while there is a variety of responses, the overall message is that these lads sell their bodies as a career, but the soul is &apos;what you think&apos;, something that cannot be taken from you. Several of these boys have screen presence and faces that, were they noticed by regular film makers, would probably give them legitimate careers. But the power of the film comes from the words of these boys, knowing completely their choice of life, and therein lies the sorrow.\n\nThis is a tough but very fine piece of film-making. Interestingly, Grodecki absorbed this material and used it to create his subsequent feature film MANDRAGORA (reviewed under that title). This film is the more powerful of the two. Not a movie for everyone, but certainly an important document about a way of life few know and fewer understand. Grady Harp",

Two really different loosers are stuck together against their will and become friends.\n\nWhat i love is that the director really trusts his story and doesn&apos;t try to tune his film up with action-sequences, fancy camera-work or flashy cutting. He just relies on the chemistry of his two main-actors, which is fabulous and on his authentic but very unpredictable story. The dialogue is very funny and so is the situation-comedy.\n\nThis movie doesn&apos;t reinvent cinema but it knows what it wants to be, and is - nothing more, nothing less - a very funny, very entertaining character-driven down to earth movie.",

M. G), modesty by Nate Torrence. Here they seek to retrieve a super mcguffin piece of new tech that they had stolen from underneath their women~wooing partying night before.\n\nFrankly, the story needs no more embelishment than a good spritz of a certain pheremone to garner genuine applause, as the script developed was either the weak ramblings of a prior draft from originating &apos;Get Smart&apos; movie or envisioned from a nasty LSD trip, what saves.., I mean, retains a measure of dignity for all concerned surely are the Wardrobe, Set construction and Soundtrack, as it makes great use of everything already purchased in the &apos;Steve Carrell&apos; vehicle.\n\nUltimately an entertainment-Lite option for viewer&apos;s who need their comedy &apos;Hammered&apos;, to their hairlines., (yes I was inspired to save the best quip for last), Hymie!!",

      "reviewBody": "Daniel Boisett (Robert Hossein) and his friend Paul Genest (Jean Sorel) are disturbed by the home owner during an attempted safe-cracking. In the ensuing mêlée, Paul accidentally kills the home owner and both men flee the scene in panic. Paul manages to escape but Daniel is shot and wounded by police and is promptly sentenced to a lengthy stint in prison. \n\nFourteen months later Daniel manages to escape and while out walking on the road he meets up with Thomas (Georges Wilson), who after the pair quickly become friends, offers him a job at the Mountain Relay Station he owns. Daniel adopts a new alias and accepts the offer, but once there he meets Thomas&apos; sexy young gold digging wife, Maria (Catherine Rouvel), and nothing will ever be the same from here on in... \n\nDirected by Julien Duvivier (Pépé le Moko), who also co-adapts the screenplay with René Barjavel from the novel &quot;Come Easy--Go Easy&quot; written by James Hadley Chase, Chair de poule (AKA: Highway Pick-Up) is French film noir excellence. A picture that carries all the hallmarks of the 40s and 50s classic film noir cycle, and proudly wears this fact as a badge of honour. \n\nComparisons have inevitably been drawn to The Postman Always Rings Twice (Tay Garnett 1946), which in itself is no bad thing at all, but this is still very much its own animal. Duvivier never lets the story sit still as a standard formulaic plot, there&apos;s always some new twisty addition to the story coming around the corner, unstable characters entering the fray to keep the bleak noirish stew bubbling away.\n\nA fascinating feature of the picture is that our main protagonist, Daniel Boisett, is actually a good guy. Sure he was a safe-cracker, but he&apos;s not murderous, and as it turns out fate conspires against him to make him seem like a multiple killer, when he clearly is not. He took the fall for his mate, escapes jail and tries desperately to start afresh with honesty and virtue. But once Maria comes into his life fate has already dealt its deadly trump card. \n\nWomen always pay with the same currency... \n\nMaria is an absolute sex bomb, a sizzling siren of sexuality, but as Daniel tells her, it&apos;s a pity she&apos;s so rotten, because she is, and very much so. Yes, there&apos;s a back story to her that stings her emotional fortitude, but she&apos;s a bad egg for sure. Things quickly spiral out of control, where even though Daniel knows that Maria is a femme fatale of the highest order, he&apos;s caught in a trap, a trap from which himself and the other male players in the piece can&apos;t possibly escape. \n\nVisually it&apos;s an intriguing picture as most of it is set in daylight up at a picturesque location. It begins in classic noir territory in the pouring rain as the men begin the safe-cracking job, and then during the escape, Duvivier and his cinematographer Léonce-Henri Burel produce a magnificent shot of a cop&apos;s giant silhouette felling the fleeing Daniel. After this we are predominantly in high light terms, but never once does the sense of claustrophobia dissipate, the atmosphere is consistently hot and sticky. \n\nImpressively performed and directed, Chair de poule is cynical, bleak and like a coiled spring waiting to explode. From that bleak rainy beginning to the explosively ironic finale, this is, basically, an essential viewing for film noir aficionados. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "I was one of the many Street Fighter fans that left the theatre in withered disappointment after seeing the live action movie. One would have thought that, after several incarnations of this classic videogame, they&apos;d at least get the storyline right. It was a massive letdown to see them mangle all the characters, too. So, when I heard there was an animated movie being released, I literally jumped with excitement; there was no way an anime would (or could) screw up as badly, after all. To my delighted surprise, it not only didn&apos;t screw up, it brought each character from &apos;Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers&apos; to life.\n\nI&apos;ve heard people complain about it lacking plot and depth; IMHO, these people have missed the entire point of the movie. The main protagonist, Ryu, is a wandering warrior seeking to improve his fighting skills by constantly testing himself against other fighters in different parts of the world. He is an uncomplicated, unpretentious person with a gentle soul and the heart of a dragon (no pun intended), with no notion of the destiny that lies before him. He and his fellow trainee/best friend Ken parted ways ere they could settle who was the better fighter. The way this part of their fates was handled is well done; and the introduction of each supporting character within this deceptively simple storyline kept me rooting for more, with the buildup to the final minutes masterfully accomplished.\n\nThere is no debate whatsoever that both the art and animation in this movie is nothing short of amazing; every movement is smooth and clearly visible, from the flexing of Ryu&apos;s toes as he takes a step to every single punch and kick thrown in a fight. The music and dialogue, both in the original and the dubbed versions, is quite suitable (there has yet to be a soundtrack for the dub, pity), and although the dialogue at the end seems anti-climactic, what a setup for a sequel!\n\nAn elegantly simple story that captures the essence of the Way of the Warrior personified. I&apos;m still watching it happily more than four years later."

In my opinion it&apos;s not quite as good as his two prior film efforts, but there are still enough laughs and good musical numbers to make it worth your while. Cantor costars with a very young Robert Young as two college seniors who are expelled on the eve of their graduation. Young goes to Mexico to find the girl he loves, Eddie goes there as a result of being forced to drive a getaway car for a gang of bank robbers and thus being wanted. The two reunite across the border and the fun begins. There are two major complications in the plot - Eddie starts hitting people anytime he hears a whistle, and while in Mexico Eddie has taken on the identity of a great bullfighter in order to avoid arrest for the bank robbery of which he was an unwilling participant.\n\nThere are two big Berkeley numbers in the film, the first one being at the very beginning and bearing a great deal of similarity to &quot;By a Waterfall&quot; in Berkeley&apos;s film &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; of the following year.",

Fortunately, Masiela Lusha is very easy on the eye and helps make the going a bit easier, but sadly doesn&apos;t go as far as getting her kit off - a shame, because if any horror film was crying out for a gratuitous shower scene to pep things up, it&apos;s this one.",

Some of its messages were given so unsubtly that it felt too underestimating even for kids who aren&apos;t super young. But in terms of children like that, I heard there were some of them who found the film a bit spooky. So overall the film isn&apos;t horrible but there are better things out there and not because of visuals or budget constrains but due to writing.",

Brenden Frasier and Ashley Judd were totally unknown to me at the time so I can&apos;t really compare any of their more recent works to this movie, but I can tell you that this movie has stayed with me for more than 6 or 7 years. I can&apos;t understand why anyone wouldn&apos;t be drawn in to the madness that is Darkly. His innocence alone would pull you in and beg for your compassion. I don&apos;t care what anyone else tells you, if you truly love great writing and movies that get to you where no other ones can, then you have to see The Passion of Darkly Noon. It&apos;s a dark thriller with a fabulous one-sided love story tragedy. Maybe I&apos;m just biased for emotionally disturbing thrillers with twisted story lines that are not so far fetched that you can&apos;t relate on some levels."

And the guy who played the bad guy was so laughable! Talk about a bad case of overacting! Anyways, I still loved this movie!

      "reviewBody": "I was really looking forward to &quot;Nobel Son&quot;. I was thinking, finally, an intelligent thriller that is going to focus on the characteristics of those found in the academic sciences. But I&apos;m afraid that all I got was a jumbled mess that never really accomplished anything.\n\nThe son of a Nobel Prize-winning chemist is kidnapped for ransom. There are a lot of interesting ways to take this story. The main problem is, they take all of them. We have an opportunity to investigate what&apos;s really going on in the mind of the son, how has his father affected his life, why does the father live his life the way he does, who is really responsible for the kidnapping and why... . The ways to explore this story are endless, and instead of delving in whole-heartedly, all that came out was a jumbled mess that left me feeling frustrated with no invested knowledge in any part of the story. Another review said the problem was too many cooks. I second that, and will adapt the phrase from &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot; to &quot;too many writers spoil the story&quot;. Only two screenwriters were credited, but I&apos;m willing to bet there were more with their hands in it.\n\nThe actors were all quite good, I&apos;m sure. It&apos;s the characters that I&apos;m more confused about. Whenever they presented a scene which echoed my experiences in the ivory tower of science, they usually followed that up with a scene that didn&apos;t make sense based on what we knew about the characters. Perhaps I was focusing too much on specifics, but I was continuously confused and frustrated by their characterization and story ideas. Too many writers, ideas, and lack of focus spoiled &quot;Nobel Son&quot;.",

Although the situation is teed up nicely for a typical feel-good ensemble gush-fest, it resists that temptation and takes you to a place where the characters are not, although they seem to need it, ready for rehab. It has an easy, rambling style that gradually rather than gratuitously opens their world to us without (for the most part) overly relying on hackneyed situations and gimmicks (although Quaid&apos;s insistence on keeping his wifes clothing was not one of them). In fact, the situations portrayed are so dark and lo- keyed that I wondered if this movie could have been made without the ready-made typecast qualities of Quaid, Haden-Church and Parker. ...Gritty Pittsburgh backdrop in a very real academic surrounding adds to the slice-of-life tone.",

Is a 2010 documentary about a group of disabled musicians from Kinshasa, Congo who use rudimentary and hand made instruments to produce wonderful rumba and reggae music. The band are followed from 2004 to 2010 by French film makers Renaud Barret and Florent de La Tullaye as they progress from living on the streets and practicing at the city&apos;s zoo to recording an album and touring Europe. The film focuses on the struggles of the various members and those around them and upon their influence in the city and especially on the young street kids who follow and assist them.\n\nThe band use strange hand peddled tricycles to get about as most of the members suffer from Polio and are unable to walk. Their songs are about their lives on the streets from being laughed at for being handicapped to songs about sleeping on cardboard. Bad things keep coming at the various members but they never let it get them down and remain focused on making a better life for themselves and their families. In one scene, the leader of the band Staff Benda Bilili a street papa called Ricky Lickabu receives a call to say that the shack that he has been staying at has been burned down. He simply turns to the camera and says &quot;these things happen in life&quot;. He is later seen sleeping on the street with his wife and four children.\n\nAlong with Ricky another one of the stars of the film is Roger Landu who was introduced to the band by the French film makers. Landu fashioned his own instrument using an empty tin can, a twig and string and is able to make incredible music from just one high pitched twang. After joining the group as a shy but dedicated young boy by the end of the film he is on stage in France performing solos, lying on his back on stage ala Jimi Hendrix to the delight of the paying crowds. It&apos;s a fantastic story.\n\nAll the way through the members of the band are sure to try to educate those around them about the likes of hard work and vaccinations and even share out what little money they make between their various hangers on. The street children who surround the band who have had no formal education speak with more wisdom and knowledge than I&apos;ve ever heard come from a Western child. They are aware of their surroundings, what has caused them and the various legal and illegal ways out and debate amongst themselves the various possibilities of their future. It&apos;s heartbreaking.\n\nOne theme throughout the film is everyone&apos;s desire to get to Europe. Europe is almost treated as a mystical place where anything is possible. Some people have misconceptions such as one child who tells his young friend that &quot;Europe is a country that God put here so we can compare it to our own&quot;. Everyone knows that their best chance of survival is to make it to Europe and the streets of Europe&apos;s cities are testament to the fact that many get here.\n\nBenda Bilili! is a thoroughly uplifting film though you have to get through some pretty rough viewing to get there. The story and people are life affirming and the music is excellent.\n\nwww.attheback.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "Passing on the street, caricaturist Ronald Colman wishes complete stranger Ginger Rogers good luck. When luck comes her way, she decides Colman is her lucky charm, and suggests he go into an Irish Sweepstakes ticket with her. She is scheduled to marry bespectacled &quot;insurance engineer&quot; Jack Carson and move to Poughkeepsie, without a honeymoon. She wants her own money. Colman agrees, if she will take all the money, save for enough for a honeymoon. Insulted, Miss Rogers fetches Carson, expecting him to thrash Colman. Instead, Colman convinces him that she will marry him win or lose, and the chances of winning are millions to one; any trip with Colman would be as brother and sister. Convinced he is in on a cinch, Carson agrees. Instead, they draw a horse. Carson surreptitiously sells &quot;her&quot; half of the ticket. When she gets her money, she tells Colman, and they go on a trip. Complications ensue.\n\nIt&apos;s carried on the charms of the two leads, of course, but I always thought there was something odd about the rhythms. I&apos;ve just done some digging and discovered it&apos;s based on a movie written, co-directed and starring Sacha Guitry. Of course! I can just see Guitry in the Colman role, talking nonsense a mile a minute; there&apos;s even a moment in which Colman&apos;s manner suggests Guitry.\n\nThe considerable charms of the leads overwhelm me, of course, but the best realized characters are in support: Carson&apos;s dull but suspicious &quot;insurance engineer&quot;; Spring Byington&apos;s bookstore owner; and Harry Davenport&apos;s judge who provides a third-act deus ex machina.\n\nGuitry&apos;s original version doesn&apos;t seem to be easily available, much as I would like to see it for comparison. What we have here is a rather sniggering crazy comedy that doesn&apos;t quite work, however much I enjoy watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "Ride Lonesome is that rare B-film, one that eclipses in a wink most of its bigger budgeted brethren. The return of scripter Burt Kennedy (who had not done the two previous Scott/Boetticher films) to the Ranown company (founded by Randolph Scott and producer Harry Joe Brown), the close group harmony, resulted in an obviously glorious reunion for all concerned.\n\n Shot entirely outdoors, like &quot;The Tall T,&quot; we have large open spaces, but a tightly confined group. This time the bounty isn&apos;t gold or money - it&apos;s outlaw Billy John (James Best). Former sheriff Ben Brigade has captured him, counting on Billy John&apos;s brother Frank (Lee Van Cleef) to come get him. Brigade has a score to settle, the murder of his wife, and he intends to settle it at a tree that holds relevance to both lawman and outlaw. Scott is joined by two minor lawbreakers, in whose hope of amnesty provided by the turning over of Billy John to authorities, provides the alliance of adversaries so common to the Boetticher films. Pernell Roberts, the more worldly and intelligent of the two, like Brigade, is looking for personal redemption, and the hope of his own ranch once he settles down. He acts a big brother to the less intelligent, and basically decent, James Coburn, in his filmic debut, is a long way from his more forceful character that would surface in later westerns of Sturges and Peckinpah. Karen Steele is on hand again (she was in &quot;Decision at Sundown&quot;), the group finds her alone in a way station, threatened by the Indians who killed her husband. She serves as conscience and libido stimulator, and her breathtaking appearance is highlighted in what is one of the film&apos;s most humorous moments (&quot;I said her eyes&quot;).\n\nSo, avoiding the Indians on their trail, and the threat of Frank&apos;s gang, Brigade leads the group to the inevitable showdown at the hanging tree that will determine the fate of the group, and the individual futures of each.\n\n Ranown, Boetticher and Kennedy had one more film to go, the actor was slowing down - after years of averaging three per year, there were just two releases in both 1957 and 1958, Ride Lonesome was the only film for 1959, and 1960&apos;s Comanche Station would be the sole film for Scott until 1962&apos;s valedictory film known as Ride the High Country."

The movie is very entertaining, but - although I must admit that Berlin and Brandenburg do have a high percentage of weirdos - the movie isn&apos;t to be taken literally. It is not an ethnographic expedition. It is a satire, and a good one at that. The queer thing about it is the fact that the people this guy meets are real, but he probably wouldn&apos;t have included any boring every-day experiences in a movie meant to make people laugh.\n\nSo, I would recommend the movie: it will probably make you laugh (specially if you are acquainted with contemporary European history) and it might even make you think. In any case it is definitely worth watching.",

However, the same shots, creepy shots, when i watch now seems cringy and comic.

The main protagonist didn&apos;t have much choice to her role and at times seemed off track or with card board laden character. The rest members faced the same fate like in the movie.\n\nA sprinkle of suggestion to the creator Rizal: stop repeated acts and jump scares, they rather rising pulse irritate and defy their own logic.",

I thought the movie was decent. Nothing special and very forgettable but it was still alright to me. Topher Grace and Josh Duhamel put up some good performances especially Topher. I thought he played a really good role. There were some funny jokes and a couple laughs like the scene when Topher and Josh are cutting wood and Josh takes off his shirt while Topher does same. I thought that scene was the funniest part of the movie. Overall, nothing really special to this film and very forgettable, but still I thought it was a decent romantic comedy Hedeen&apos;s Outlook: 6/10 ** C-",

For the emperor penguins life is an everyday struggle to survive against predators, storms, and raging winds in the harshest weather conditions on earth. The documentary, filmed on location in Antarctica, shows the birds&apos; struggle to eat, live, and reproduce. Each year the birds walk over seventy miles across ice and snow to their breeding ground. There the penguins mate, then conceal their eggs from the cold under a fold of their skin and balancing the precious new life to be born on their claws. Fathers take turns in caring for the eggs until they hatch, while mothers walk long miles again to bring home food for the chicks. Once the chicks are born, the parents work together to feed, shelter, and raise them. French director Luc Jacquet was a scientist before he became a filmmaker. He succeeded in making the story dramatic, compelling, and comprehensible to younger viewers. The film is skillfully narrated by Morgan Freeman. It is a definite MUST SEE.",

      "reviewBody": "As we move ever further into the 21st Century, more and more Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers are finding themselves thrust into the role of primary caregiver to their ailing and aging parents. Such a situation is challenging enough even under the best of circumstances, but what if the person who needs taking care of was never a loving and nurturing parent to begin with, or the middle-aged child has more than enough problems on his own plate to deal with? This is the dilemma faced by John and Wendy Savage, a brother and sister who have long been estranged from the father who left them when they were youngsters but who has now come back into their lives after he can no longer take care of himself. Despite the fact that the siblings feel little emotional attachment to their father, they agree to do the decent thing by caring for him in his final days, even though his dementia makes it nearly impossible for them to heal old wounds or build a filial bridge between them.\n\nMeanwhile, John and Wendy, both unmarried and childless, aren&apos;t exactly what one would call models of highly functional and successful adults in their own right. John is a theater professor and part-time author who lives in a shabby Buffalo apartment with a girl from Poland who is being deported because John, commitment-phobic that he is, can&apos;t bring himself to marry her. Wendy is an unsuccessful playwright who pays the bills with temp jobs and has been carrying on a dead-end affair with a married man for years.\n\n&quot;The Savages&quot; works on a dual level, exposing the grim realities of aging, while at the same time exploring the complexities of familial (i.e. parent-child and sibling) relationships. The strain on everyone caught in this type of a predicament can be devastating and overwhelming, and writer/director Tamara Jenkins examines the situation from all angles. John and Wendy have an understandable urge to live their own lives, and they feel ill-equipped to cope with this new burden that has been suddenly placed upon them. The situation also opens up old wounds related to their upbringing and heightens their own feelings of inadequacy and failure. John and Wendy are also not above turning against one another when the world gets to be a bit too much for them to handle, wounding each other with verbal thrusts and jabs carefully aimed at their various weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe subject matter is obviously dark and brooding, but the filmmakers inject a surprising amount of biting, whistling-past-the-graveyard humor to help lighten the load. They are also helped in this regard by the rich and engaging performances of its three leading actors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is remarkably quiet and subdued in his role of John, the more cynical of the two children who feels a little less guilt-ridden about doing the minimum for a man who never took on the very role of paternal caregiver to his children that they are assuming for him. As the father, Philip Bosco rises to the difficult challenge of portraying a man who&apos;s lost much of his ability to connect with the world around him. But it is Laura Linney who provides the warm human center that lifts the movie above the dreary nature of its material. It is Wendy who struggles most with doing what is right by trying to make the last days of a man who abandoned her as comfortable as possible. In her every word and gesture, Linney shows that she understands the paradoxical nature of the character she is being called on to play, revealing her weaknesses and vulnerabilities, while, at the same time, showing her to be a woman of strength and character, even if she has trouble displaying much of either of those qualities in her own life. In fact, we sense that Wendy does quite a bit of growing up in the course of her struggles. Wendy may hate her father for never being there for her and her brother, but she knows maturity means moving beyond one&apos;s bitterness over the past and responding to the basic humanity of even the most undeserving among us.\n\nWhat I like about &quot;The Savages&quot; is that it doesn&apos;t devolve into angst-ridden hand-wringing or self-aggrandizing melodramatics in dealing with its topic. Instead, in this her fifth film as a director, Jenkins illuminates a difficult subject with subtlety, insight and compassion. Definitely one worth seeing.",

      "reviewBody": "In the French humorous show, &quot;les guignols de l&apos;info&quot;, Christophe Lambert often says in a weary tone: &quot;Yeah, I know. All my movies are rotten.&quot; Well, he should think twice before telling silly things. Indeed, &quot;Max et Jérémie&quot; (1992) is his best movie since &quot;Greystoke&quot; (1984). And this terrific movie is perfectly mastered by Claire Devers. This woman&apos;s got plenty of nerve to film violence and blood.\n\nAs it was the case with another French movie &quot;the little criminal&quot; (1990, dialogs constitute the vividness of the movie. They contain a lot of humor that enables to keep the spectator in suspense. It also enables to reduce the seriousness of the dramatic side of the story. But especially, Claire Devers emphasized on the dialogs for a better focus on the relationships between the two men: on one hand, Jérémie (Christophe Lambert): a lost young man who wishes to gain Philippe Noiret&apos;s friendship and on the other hand, Max (Philippe Noiret), an elderly man who&apos;ll gradually become attached to Max. Little by little, a (a bit confused but strong) friendship will link the two men. Obviously, this friendship will have its ups and downs.\n\nApart from this, the action sequences aren&apos;t neglected for all that and they turn out to be thrilling. At the end, the whole gives a stable movie and remarkably well constructed. In spite of a few weaknesses (Claire Devers dressed a caricatured portrait of Jean-Pierre Marielle&apos;s assistant and the last twenty minutes tend to run out of steam), it&apos;s useless to be fussy for this brilliant success. This is arguably one of the best French detective movies of the nineties. At last, one thing I don&apos;t understand: how can such a good movie have a rather low mark on IMDB? It&apos;s not fair, it deserves much more recognition.",

No such luck here. Creature Unknown&quot; a clichéd monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other. The monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of Paul Blaisdell. So bad it&apos;s good! The rest of the show is just so bad it&apos;s bad.

They hire a guy named Robert (Josh Green) to work the show and carve some new puppets for Magrew. Naturally, the doc has more nefarious plans for his new hire. CURSE OF THE PUPPTER MASTER finds the series back in the hands of David DeCoteau, who previously made the good part III. Without the help of Paramount&apos;s funds though, the difference is quite noticeable. This is the first entry to not feature any original stop motion by David Allen. Even worse, 90% of the footage of the puppets is stolen from the previous 5 entries. There is one genuinely creepy scene where Jane discovers the burnt remains of a human-puppet hybrid in the woods and DeCoteau does have two surreal dream sequences where Robert thinks he is made of wood. But it isn&apos;t enough to salvage such a cheap production. It literally just ends with the characters never heard from again as the team went old school with RETRO PUPPET MASTER (1999) after this.",

This is because the plot is extremely slowly paced: I usually don&apos;t mind watching pictures where there&apos;s not a lot of action, but then I want content! There also seems to be no connection between the ending and the rest of the movie, something which ought to disturb most viewers. Taking all this into consideration, there&apos;s really no wonder that the revenues from this movie only covered about 1/20 of the budget!",

      "reviewBody": "Danny Lee is well known for being the &quot;Dirty Harry of Hong Kong&quot; and in my opinion this is his absolute best performance as the Inspector Lee character. Inspector Lee is a rogue, but ultra dedicated and overworked cop. He doesn&apos;t go by the book and breaks lots of rules in the process, but strongly believes in justice and does a good job. His team of cops are totally loyal and dedicated to Inspector Lee and always back him up. Opposite of that is Anthony Wong, a triad boss and jewel thief that along with his girlfriend (Cecelia Yip) really make the cops earn their pay in pursuit. Tung,(Anthony Wong) is generally a fairly honorable criminal and his gang are absolutely loyal to him as well. This ultra gritty police procedural is extremely well acted, tightly directed and slickly shot. This film shows Inspector Lee and Tung&apos;s world&apos;s collide and shows many layers of grey in the characterization and story. The action scenes and shootouts are more realistic and less stylized than something you would be accustomed to seeing in a John Woo film. In my opinion Kirk Wong as well as the cast and crew did an incredible job making this and is criminally underrated.",

This is first and foremost a platform to display Madhuri Dixit and it does it well, her dance sequences are fabulous, she looks stunning (none of your anorexic western beauties here)and her acting surpasses the needs of the script. The film rips off loads of Robin Hood ideas (and even some of the sequencies from Prince of Thieves) and Naseeruddin Shah plays a wonderful &quot;Sheriff of Nottingham&quot; character plus he also plays a comical twin brother that provides some good humour. Anil Kapoor is not at his best as the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; prince, he seems to flip through this movie without putting any effort into it.  His action sequencies follow a rather predictable formula (well he is a hero in a Bollywood movie) but the duel with the giant cannibal whilst they are bouncing about on bungy rubber was really hilarious (although I am sure it wasn&apos;t meant to be).  The cinematography in the main was fabulous, very colourful and some expensive sets (ok so there were cheap ones as well) and even some computer-generated ones. All in all a very entertaining film for lovers of this genre and Dixit fans in particular but please don&apos;t let it be your first Bollywood movie, there are many better ones out there to cut your teeth on."

This also shows how much Jehovah has opened the spiritual eyes or his slave class and how much clearer Bible understanding is today. We&apos;ve really come a long way and have so much to look forward to. This can help you appreciate Jehovah has an earthly organization that has always been and will always be a step ahead of anything this old, dying world has to offer.

I remember loving this when I first watched it over a decade ago and after a recent run of disappointing movies I wanted to see something I knew or thought I&apos;d love so I went with this.\n\nStraight off the bat, I noticed how much more believable cgi and vfx used to look in the 2010&apos;s and you can see that with other movies like iron man or transformers, while new movies now just look like video games more often than not. I loved how even though it&apos;s set in the &apos;future&apos;, the surroundings felt relatable, not all super shiny, slick new tech, adds to the plausibility of it all even though it&apos;s scifi.\n\nIt&apos;s not complex plot or avant-garde script because it&apos;s made just for fun. Has everything you&apos;d want in a feel good action flick; it has flare, blood pumping fights, great soundtrack, story, carnage, an underdog to root for and it even has heart as we get to see a father and son bond together. The movie is sweet and heartfelt at it&apos;s core behind all the metal bashing. One thing that stood apart for me about the movie is the end, it ends at the perfect moment, most movies would want a moment of reflection or something after an epic finale like that but Real Steel leaves you while your adrenaline&apos;s still pumping. If you haven&apos;t watched it, go watch it, and if you have, rewatch.",

Feelings of pain, desperation, disillusion, wrath, revenge, redemption... go like a domino effect through each and every single one of the inhabitants of this town. They all change after this incident, because everybody was either with or against poor Eufemio Zárate (Aldama). Eufemio&apos;s kid was sick and he was so desperate, he did something unforgivable. Somehow is caught and to make matters worse a little pig steals the scene with its antics. It is the Priest who have to settle matters down. After that, nobody will look at anybody else with the same eyes. Now they really know what&apos;s going on with them. This movie is magic, reflects what each and everyone has inside and how they all react in a stressful situation in a very subtle and definitive way..."

People die, choppers crash, and all kinds of things happen, but if you try to spot the scenes reminicent of Aliens, then it actually becomes kinda fun (be sure to add in the &quot;get away from her, you B****&quot; line near the end).\n\nAs far as acting goes, not too bad. It just would have helped to have something of a plot or dialog. A must-see for B-moviers, just for the laughs."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is definitely not an Oscar material, but if you don&apos;t know what to do of your evening and want to enjoy harmless fun without too much thinking, then this is for you. The main story revolves around a trio of cops coming from the minority living in France (1 African Arab, 1 black African and 1 Asian) who are assigned the task to find a serial killer, who kills and rapes women in the french town Villeneuve. Their investigation leads to many comical and absurd situations, which are used to complete the main plot of the movie. Most of the jokes of in the movie are clichés about Islam, Muslims, and minorities in France in general but without being really offensive. I enjoyed also the appearance of the &quot;muscles from Brussels&quot;, Jean-Claude Van Damme. It&apos;s refreshing to see him in a comedy role for once, and also to see him acting(?) in french again after JCVD. But as I said, not an Oscar material, so do not expect to be amazed by a great story or an incredible acting work despite the presence of some famous french actors (Jugnot, Belasco...)",

It was definitely reminiscent of Honeymoon Travels with the different couples but there was not much else in common. Each couple had their own story and and if you decide to watch it there is a plot twist with one of the couples that you probably wont see coming. I was a little confused between with the backstory of Shoaib-Anaya...it couldve been a little clearer. Acting wise, Esha doesnt have a whole a lot range as always. Her character required a lot of expressing without dialogue and that was never her strong point. If you&apos;ve seen her other movies, you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;ve seen her play this role before. Fardeen was quite good and if you are a fan of his you will definitely appreciate this little gem of a movie. Sometimes, because of his accent, the dialogues dont come across as sincere. He definitely sounds like someone who learned hindi abroad. Everyone else was good in their roles as well. Satish-Kirron were awesome as the older bickering couple. Raj Zutshi suited his role quite well. Bikram Saluja shouldve remained a model. Perizaad overracted but there&apos;s reason why. The songs were nothing stand out. Special mention to former lovers Eijaz-Anita for their small role in the film! Overall, this movie was mostly time-pass, but it is a good watch for anyone embarking on an arranged marriage and i think this movie will speak to those the most.",

      "reviewBody": "When the Berlin Wall is torn down in 1989, a left-wing author Hanna Flanders (Hannelore Elsner) is completely shocked and sees no future for herself without the DDR. She decides to move to Berlin to start over with her former lover but everything has changed so profoundly that she just cannot find her place in the world anymore.\n\nEven though at first the movie seems like a primarily societal one, the politics provide only the backdrop for Hanna&apos;s personal journey and the examination of feelings of alienation in the modern world. The beautiful, classy black &amp; white cinematography and the mise en scène emphasize Hanna&apos;s loneliness and the film focuses entirely on her. She meets a lot of people on her travels, both old friends and relatives as well as new acquaintances, but none of them stay in the picture for long and very few understand how she feels about the DDR or life in general. They all have different views on the events, thus providing a look into the minds of ordinary Germans of the era, so in the end the film does have a strong societal level too, despite the main attention being on personal feelings.\n\nThe character of Hanna Flanders is based on director Roehler&apos;s mother, German writer Gisela Elsner who committed suicide in 1992, so I can imagine the film having been a very personal project for Roehler. Luckily his strong directorial style makes the story appealing to the general public too and not just to those familiar with Elsner&apos;s life and works. Hannelore Elsner (no relation to Gisela Elsner despite the name) also does a very convincing job in showing Hanna Flanders&apos; emotions throughout the film. I think I can safely recommend No Place to Go to anyone who is into bleak, depressing portrayals of anxiety and loneliness, but the presentation of the social climate of the era should also fascinate those who are interested in the Division of Germany and the end of it.",

Regardless of the many characters, Tracy&apos;s talent always shown through and became memories for his many fans. Here is one exceptional example. The movie, Directed by John Sturges, is called &quot; Bad Day at Black Rock. &quot; It relates the story of John Macreedy, (Spencer Tracy) a U.S. Army veteran who decides to visit the town of Black Rock, the hometown of a Japanese friend killed during the war. However upon arrival, he is greeted with suspicion, resentment and apathy. The longer he stays, the more questions he has to ask. Unfortunately, everyone he questions has been told not to talk to him. Led by Reno Smith (Robert Ryan), others are intimated not to co-operate with the stranger, The exceptional cast includes Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, Ernest Borgnine, Anne Francis and Lee Marvin. Though the vast scenic desert, surrounds this forgotten town, it nevertheless allows the foreboding atmosphere to commit itself to a linger secret which prevails and haunts the towns folks. An excellent film for a time when true drama could fit well into a pleasant afternoon. ****",

      "reviewBody": "This is the feature film debut of actress Do-yeon Jeon who went on to win best actress by unanimous decision for her role in Secret Sunshine at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. If you are a fan of her work you should definitely see The Contact. It&apos;s not a great film but her performance in it makes it more than worthwhile.\n\nThe Contact is the story of two people, each involved in their own forlorn love triangles, who meet on the Internet and slowly build a friendship acting as advice-givers to one another. They share the same space on screen several times without knowing it because neither one knows what the other looks like. Comparisons have been made to You&apos;ve Got Mail which came out a year after The Contact, but beyond the, uh ... internet connection, there&apos;s not much else in common. You&apos;ve Got Mail was a romantic comedy, which suited the actors starring in it, while this film sports a somber quality, more suited to the actors starring in it. Do-yeon Jeon has a wistful glamor about her that comes from the inside, and Suk-kyu Han, who plays the male lead, has a &quot;woe is me&quot; air about him that is not the least bit amusing and comes off as a little introspectively self-important.\n\nThere is about three minutes of (in)-action just before the end of this film in which you will hate Han&apos;s character for the decision he seems to be making and the effect it has on Jeon&apos;s character. If there were a little more plot substance to account for his inaction, well ... there&apos;d be a little more plot substance.\n\nIt&apos;s substance that this film lacks in the overall, especially in Han&apos;s character. He&apos;s a radio show producer who is always being reprimanded for inserting 20 minute songs into the playlists. He receives an anonymous package one day that contains a Velvet Underground album which becomes the link between our protagonists. Han is convinced his long lost love sent it to him but doesn&apos;t know why. He plays &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; from the album and receives a request via the internet the following night for the same song, and that&apos;s how he connects with Jeon.\n\nHan contacts the person, Jeon, who made the request, hoping it is his old flame or someone who knows her and made the request on her behalf. Jeon lies and says she knows the person Han is looking for. As that little fiction plays out, so do the characters&apos; back stories.\n\nHan&apos;s long lost love broke up with him many years ago and fell for his best friend, an army buddy. When the army buddy is killed in an accident, Han thinks the girl will come running back to him, (now that the competition is dead!) but Han is somehow implicated in the cause of the accident and a tangled web is weaved. Han also deals with internal office politics complicated by a beautiful woman who becomes his main writer for the radio show and an emotional distraction.\n\nJeon, on the other hand, marches forward emotionlessly after her unrequited true love falls for her best friend and roommate instead of her. While Jeon&apos;s love triangle plays out a little more interestingly than Han&apos;s, it&apos;s the emotionlessness of her character, which isn&apos;t cold and unkind, but sympathetic and sad, manifested in her inability to cry, that we come to focus on. In a train wreck of plot development, Jeon is driving her car the night Han first plays &quot;Pale Blue Eyes.&quot; She witnesses a terrible accident, but it is the song, not the tragedy, that almost makes her cry. Hence her request to hear the song again. She wants to cry.\n\nThe Korean film&apos;s plot was made more complicated to this viewer, as train tickets, movie stubs, and other written materials are passed around without translation. Even without a good story or all the facts to go on, I was swept away by Jeon&apos;s portrayal of a woman who wants to find love but must discover first what it might look like. She&apos;s a tremendously skilled and nuanced actress. I recommend this film for those looking for a night of romance rental theater or a romantic character-study piece.",

      "reviewBody": "Granger and his partner Charlie are struggling in the advertising business. They make a sultry and suggestive presentation to Kit Hawksin of Hawksin Hotels, a very demanding businessman. Hawksin is very disappointed that the ad executives do not get his conservative views, but he agrees to give them another chance.\n\nWhile in bed with his intimidating girlfriend Emory, Granger receives a call from CitiOne Bank saying his identity has been stolen. It is the first of many contacts Granger will have with &quot;Jennifer David&quot;, who claims to be from San Francisco. Actually she is Priya Sethi of Mumbai, India.\n\nPriya is engaged to Vikram but doesn&apos;t love him. As is often the case in India, it is an arranged marriage and her conservative parents don&apos;t care what Priya wants. They are even bothered that she works the night shift (because that is daytime in the United States, where CitiOne wants its customers to think the callers are from) and seem to want her to leave that job. But Priya is very good at her job and enjoys it; she mimics an American accent perfectly. And we see the training the employees get: it&apos;s quite detailed and we see how her employer expects everyone to convince people they are American.\n\nCharlie, meanwhile, is also about to get married, and Granger will be his best man. This provides even more distractions.\n\nAs part of his effort to win over Hawksin, Granger and Charlie have to go to San Francisco. This gives Priya a chance to meet Granger, and she reluctantly agrees to do so--in order to talk about business. She has relatives in the area and her family believes she is visiting them. Never mind how she gets so much time off work. \n\nBut when Granger arrives at the meeting place, he sees several girls who could be &quot;Jennifer&quot;. Realizing she has seen granger, and knowing she will never live up to his expectations, she gives up on trying to meet him. But then Granger bumps into her--literally. Granger and Priya immediately make a connection, and to make sure their relationship will work, Priya keeps quiet about her real identity, claiming to be a nurse from India on vacation.\n\nIt just so happens Priya is staying at Hawksin Hotel, and Hawksin meets both Granger and Priya. He asks Priya for an evaluation of his hotel and she does a wonderful job, worthy of one of his commercials. For that he rewards her with one of the finest rooms.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya&apos;s parents wonder what has happened to her, and they angrily take off for San Francisco to retrieve their wayward daughter.\n\nOver the course of the movie, Granger and Priya run into numerous obstacles. Will they overcome them?\n\nWell, I can say this much. The ending is nothing short of amazing.\n\nShriya Saran is beautiful, adorable, easy to like and quite talented. She does a very convincing American accent and comes across as very intelligent, though she&apos;s just cute enough not to be threatening. \n\nUnlike Sara Foster, who is merely pretty, but we don&apos;t want to like her and we&apos;re not supposed to want her and Granger to make it.\n\nJesse Metcalfe also does quite a good job. Especially in one scene toward the end, but I don&apos;t want to give away too much. I&apos;ll just say he talks about the time he and Charlie went to summer camp. \n\nThe clash between cultures provides some opportunities for comedy, and both leads make this work.\n\nAustin Basis is appealing, coming across as an friendly but somewhat incompetent. I especially liked how Hawksin intimidated him and pointed to his proper and quiet Japanese associate of thirty-plus years. Larry Miller, as Hawskin, also does a very good job as a demanding businessman. \n\nThe conservative Indian relatives make this movie different. The father Rajeev is determined to keep his family in the past but realizes he is fighting a losing battle. He is appealing in a bumbling way.\n\nThere is one hilarious scene at the San Francisco hotel involving words that can have more than one meaning. The movie does get slightly naughty from time to time, and it would be hard to describe it as a family film, but the version I saw likely had some offensive material cut out for broadcast TV and was relatively clean.\n\nIt&apos;s mostly formula but it&apos;s a winning formula."

The&apos;re is some good dialog, which made me laugh, but there was too much of it. Too many scenes and feelings we&apos;re explained by dialog.\n\nSome of the characters we&apos;re unrealistic, like the woman who holds the diet club.\n\nI know it&apos;s a matter of style, but never the less, it didn&apos;t struck me. The film has gotten some good reviews, so maybe I&apos;m just the wrong person for this movie. Man in his forties, who see&apos;s a lot of film.\n\nThere is twist of a romantic comedy in it, which probably makes it a very good dating movie. But for me it was a bit too naive and some of the scenes we&apos;re just so simple and looked too much like television.\n\nThe cinematography of the film excels only in a few sumo scenes. Otherwise it&apos;s stuff made straight to DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "In the Austin, Texas, area, several youths complete their last day at school and celebrate through the night.\n\n&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; failed at the box office in 1993-94, but has gone on to achieve a deserved cult status. It&apos;s one of the best high school comedy-dramas, along with &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982). The difference between these two is that &quot;Fast Times&quot; contains more goofy antics whereas &quot;Dazed&quot; is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes. In other words, although &quot;Fast Times is generally realistic, excepting the over-the-top parts with Spicoli, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is more like a slice from real life.\n\nWhat makes &quot;Dazed&quot; work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the mid-to-late 70s just right, particularly the hair &amp; clothing styles, although Slater (Rory Cochrane) seems like a nod to 90&apos;s grunge.\n\nSecondly, the actors pull off the material. A large part of the film&apos;s success is the excellent casting choices. You get a few up-and-comers here: Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich and Ben Affleck, along with one or two of lesser note (in regards to future success), e.g. Jason London and Parker Posey.\n\nAll the standard school archetypes are present: the jock who parties on the side, the bullies, the hot sister and her little long-haired brother, the black dude, the sexy Lib teacher, the streetfighter, the cool guys, the geekier crowd, the babes, the guy who graduated years ago but still hangs around, the mentors &amp; mentees, etc.\n\nThen you have the standard school experiences like setting up parties at a friend&apos;s houses when the parents are away, keg parties, running from bullies, dealing with coaches &amp; teachers, flirting, the possibility of sex, hanging out, meaningless conversations, fights, smoking pot at school or in your friend&apos;s bedroom, etc.\n\nLike &quot;Fast Times,&quot; &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is a joy to watch because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys &amp; agonies.\n\nSome don&apos;t like it because it&apos;s more of a slice-of-life than a plot-driven, contrived story. The plot here is simple: It&apos;s the last day of school and the youths want to celebrate. If they can&apos;t do it at their friend&apos;s house they&apos;ll find a place at a park or local hangout, but they WILL party. The rest of the film involves their interactions within this context.\n\nI&apos;ve heard some complain that the movie conveys a terrible message. What message? There is no message. The message is that school&apos;s out and it&apos;s time to celebrate! Besides, there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings: the arrogant bully gets what&apos;s coming, make a stand and fight when you have to (even if you get beat up), ultra-tight pants must be put on with pliers, be true to yourself, etc. But, really, this isn&apos;t a flick to look for deep messages, its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years (in this case, 1976) and all the fun &amp; pain thereof.\n\nAside from those already mentioned, Michelle Burke stands out on the female front as Jodi, along with Joey Lauren Adams as Simone (she has such a beautiful, soothing voice). Then there&apos;s redhead Marissa Ribisi as Cynthia.\n\nNo review of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. You get some great rock/metal of the 70s like &quot;Sweet Emotion,&quot; &quot;School&apos;s Out,&quot; &quot;Stranglehold,&quot; &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do,&quot; &quot;Love Hurts,&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Hootchie Coo,&quot; &quot;Rock &amp; Roll All Nite,&quot; &quot;Slow Ride,&quot; &quot;Cherry Bomb,&quot; &quot;Tuesday&apos;s Gone&quot; and many more.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in the Austin, Texas, area.\n\nGRADE: A-",

      "name": "Actually pretty good, and definitely not a &quot;rip-off&quot; of The Road Warrior, which did not come out beforehand",
      "reviewBody": "Another post-apocalyptic sci-fi, recently released on a DVD alongside Deathsport. Likewise, this one is very lowly rated (4.1 at the moment). I can understand that about Deathsport, but I think Battletruck (aka Warlords of the 21st Century) is downright good. I think the problem is that it&apos;s very similar to George Miller&apos;s The Road Warrior. Some IMDb reviewers even refer to it as a rip-off, but it was being made before The Road Warrior was ever even released, and, at least in most places, it was released almost at the exact same time (in the U.S. both were released in April of 1982). Compared to The Road Warrior, okay, Battletruck isn&apos;t nearly as good. But I won&apos;t hold that against it. The Road Warrior is all kinds of awesome. Battletruck is merely good, with a less ambitious story, though still probably too ambitious to completely succeed with the small budget it had. But still, it&apos;s pretty good. Michael Beck of The Warriors stars (though he doesn&apos;t appear for a good while into the film, which is a cool touch) as a lone wolf in this post-apocalyptic wasteland. He rescues Annie McEnroe (a character actress whom you might recognize from Beetlejuice and many other films), who has escaped her villain father (James Wainwright), but is left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Wainwright drives around in the titular truck raiding whatever settlements he can find and stealing all the oil and gasoline he can find. Beck takes McEnroe to a democratic settlement called Clearwater (among whose citizens is John Ratzenberger, who probably has more lines in this movie than any other before he started working with Pixar). They aren&apos;t all too trusting of Beck, who does some business with Clearwater but lives out on his own somewhere, and some of the citizens fear McEnroe&apos;s presence. That proves insightful when Wainwright comes along looking for her (and fuel). The action sequences in the film are well done, and the scenery is nice (it was filmed in New Zealand). Too bad it was shot in Academy ratio (or perhaps only still exists in that format).",

      "name": "Colourful documentary about a rock band that, while critically acclaimed, seemed destined to sink without trace... and then gradually became a classic",
      "reviewBody": "BIG STAR: Nothing Can Hurt Me is a 2012 documentary about the eponymous 1970s pop-rock band from Memphis that saw few sales in spite of enormous critical acclaim, but went on to become a cult phenomenon and inspire some great bands in the decades that followed. The documentary was made without the participation of Big Star&apos;s surly frontman Alex Chilton (and it was completed following Chilton&apos;s untimely death), but it does feature interviews with bassist Andy Hummel, drummer Jody Stephens, and the musicians brought on when Chilton announced a new Big Star in the 1990s. Furthermore, producer John Fry appears throughout the documentary and appears to have had a bigger role in the Big Star story than many listeners might have imagined.\n\nThe film begins with the Memphis context of the late 1960s/early 1970s. Chilton, who had already had a chart hit with the band The Box Top and toured the country, comes home and starts a new band with Chris Bell. The process of recording Big Star&apos;s first album &quot;#1 Record&quot; is explained in some depth, from how the band used the available studio resources to where the iconic cover art came from.\n\nWe learn how Bell splits after the first album, has a nervous breakdown and flirts with evangelical Christianity, tries to make it as a musician in England and cuts the legendary single &quot;You and Your Sister/I am the Cosmos&quot;, and finally dies in 1978 of a car crash at only 27 years old. There are poignant interviews with Bell&apos;s older brother and sister-in-law, but part of Bell&apos;s angst was his homosexuality, and everyone is uncomfortable even approaching this subject.\n\nThe documentary continues through the recording of Big Star&apos;s second (&quot;Radio City&quot;) and third (&quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;) records, followed by the ultimate breakdown of relations between Jody Stephens and Alex Chilton and the end of Big Star. There&apos;s some brief coverage of Chilton&apos;s solo career through the 1980s and the reformed Big Star in the 1990s and early millennium. There are some brief comments from later, perhaps more famous musicians that express an eternal debt to Big Star, like Teenage Fanclub and Mike Mills of R.E.M.\n\nThis is one of those documentaries that, to a degree, expects viewers to already know quite a bit about the band in question, making it somewhat frustrating for those who know Big Star&apos;s name and legacy but not so much the band&apos;s career and arc. It is mentioned that #1 Record sold poorly through label problems, but it&apos;s as if the viewer is already supposed to know that it was poorly distributed. It is mentioned briefly that Chris Bell died in a car crash, but with little detail. And there are some aspects of the production that seem mystery. For example, why does Jody Stephens have such a bad attitude throughout his interviews? Still, I enjoyed BIG STAR: Nothing Can Hurt Me overall. So many rock documentaries interview people who exploded into stardom, moved to la-la-land like California and seem to live on another planet compared to non-celebrities. Here, on the other hand, it&apos;s amazing just what ordinary southern Americans these people are, who clearly have some good memories of their youth but never really went for celebrity culture. They could be one&apos;s neighbours or the people you pass in the supermarket. That&apos;s not to say that they aren&apos;t interesting, as they include some quirky characters like the affably campy John King and producer Jim Dickinson&apos;s elderly but eternally young widow.",

It&apos;s primarily aimed at teens and piles up Hollywood clichés like it&apos;s a contest or something, but despite those hurdles it manages to strike exactly the right dark tone. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really good in the Glenn Close role, technically she only gives her villain one dimension but it&apos;s a dimension you love to hate. She has acid running through her veins, in fact the whole movie seems a lot more harsh and direct than &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; was. Do I actually prefer this high schooler remake over the original &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;? Well, secretly yes, but to avoid being burned on a pyre I&apos;ll just say they&apos;re both excellent movies in their own right. &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; is just a great watch though.",

He and his wife faces huge challenges to adjust to his new functional level.\n\nI bought the DVD of &quot;Memories of Tomorrow&quot; years ago but haven&apos;t watched it until now. I wish I watched it earlier, because it is superb. Ken Watanabe&apos;s acting is very good, he convinces the viewers about his poor memory, his fear and confusion that he does not perform as he used to. In the second half of the film, the film focuses more on the wife. She is superb as an ever so supportive wife who is strained to the core, yet remains strong and positive. The film really highlights the butterfly effect of memory loss, both on the sufferer and the carers. Moreover, the film has a strong feel of realism, and events are not exaggerated at all. It touches me heart and I hope it will touch other people too."

A back stage story that sets the standard for all those &quot;unknown becomes overnight star&quot; films. The weakest part of it all is Ruby Keeler and I apologize in advance to all of her fans and there are many. She was an Irish Step Dancer, which does not come across very well in film. Step dancers concentrate on their feet only and upper body movement is not a consideration. This makes the dancer appear as heavy footed and clumsy. Plus she wasn&apos;t a very good actress and didn&apos;t sing very well either. But she was as cute as a button with those big eyes and innocent face,so all is forgiven.\n\nWarner Baxter gives the best performance of his career as the driven director who verges on madness. Dick Powell is delightful as the juvenile; many who only know him from his later films are not aware that he had a beautiful tenor voice and made his first splash in films as a singer and light comedian. Ginger Rogers is perfect as the slightly dishonorable chorus girl with the sugar daddy and Una Merkle playing Ginger&apos;s pal is surprisingly cute. Bebe Daniels is beautiful as the star of the play and does a great rendition of &quot;You&apos;re Getting To Be A Habit With Me&quot;., The rest of the supporting cast is right on target...with some good support from Ned Sparks, Guy Kibbee and the ubiquitous George E. Stone.\n\nA lot got by the censors in this film to the delight of the audience....things were tightened up the next year as the Hayes Office started cracking down. Enjoy this film...enjoy, enjoy, and enjoy!!"

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the most rewarding pictures I&apos;ve seen in a long time. It&apos;s a breath of fresh air from the usual mainstream hokum, mixing black comedy and dry humor with genuine warmth and empathy. It&apos;s a movie you don&apos;t want to end, but when it does, you kinda want to give it a big hug.\n\nThere are no cheap laughs or lame gags here - the humor bubbles along like an undercurrent, echoing real life. Life is a constant source of amusement - we just have to recognize the fact and tap into it sometimes. \n\nThe storybook device, where the protagonist speaks directly to the audience, was perfectly weighted, cutting in at just the right moment to pace the movie and remind you of the pretext. \n\nAll the characters were well-rounded and authentic - I was particularly impressed that Craig&apos;s psychiatrist was played totally straight. The temptation to have her do or be something slightly crazy or contrived must have been great, but it was thankfully resisted. Likewise, the inmates of the psychiatric ward - there&apos;s a charming and utterly believable sense that everyone&apos;s a bit off kilter, rather than jokingly deranged. \n\nThe patients in the film aren&apos;t the butt of the joke - society and its proclivities are. That said, as a British viewer, I found it more difficult to appreciate how academia and peer pressure drive school-kids to anti-depressants and therapy - and for them to be impressed by the fact. I probably missed some of the main messages and in-jokes of the film, being from Yorkshire, rather than New York.\n\nNevertheless, I don&apos;t think you can fail to love this film. Zach Galifianakis is adorable, Emma Roberts is gorgeous and Keir Gilchrist manages to combine confusion and teenage erudition superbly. \n\nIf nothing else, you have to love the self-indulgent interludes, especially the 3D animation through Craig&apos;s fictional, line-drawn world and the wonderfully camp group performance of &apos;Under Pressure&apos;. The soundtrack is spot on right to the last - who knew traditional Egyptian music could be the saving grace?",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know why they had to have John Saxon play the leading role in this movie; the Production Team could have chosen one of several dozen British actors who would have done a better job and better fitted the role.  But then perhaps the film had American backers and they were calling the tune. Speaking of tune, the introductory song/music on the DVD version of the film is pathetic and totally incomparable to the original brilliant 60s pop instrumental &quot;Image&quot; with its Telstar-type organ backing. All that aside the movie is one that joins many other British SF films in the ranks of fame and is not totally unfaithful to Frank Crisp&apos;s 1963 novel &quot;The Night Callers&quot; on which it was based.  It has moments which are slightly unnerving, particularly when the proposed candidates for shipping back to Ganymede are being interviewed by the man (monster) behind the shadows.  Generally speaking there were very few dull moments and the pace of the plot was just right.  Perhaps the ending could have been extended and more seen of the hideous alien with the claw-like appendages. Denham shines out above anyone else in the male cast leaving Saxon looking on from the sidelines as if he were a last minute, and not totally comfortable sub. A must see gem of a movie and despite the absence of the original introductory music the DVD will make a good addition to any SF Movie Buff&apos;s collection."

Angela is shocked to find Dixie&apos;s father, fading country singer Bo Price (Toby Keith), has also returned.\n\nToby Keith is a stiff actor. I&apos;m trying to accept that for this character. He&apos;s a piece of stone stuck in the middle of the screen. Kelly Preston is no great catch either. It&apos;s more interesting to see Burt again. The girl shows different sides and out performs everybody else. The music is pretty good and that helps a lot. Otherwise, it&apos;s a relatively unimaginative melodrama.",

The movie is 100% adrenalin rush action with Rajini&apos;s and Aiswarya&apos;s stunning performance. The graphic sequences are awesome. Its very difficult to distinguish graphics from reality. Last 1hr of the movie reminds us of &apos;the matrix&apos;. The songs are picturised in a spectacular way. The movie is a super-hit in all possible angles. See it before others do.

      "reviewBody": "If Ed Wood was given color film stock and a budget that was double the nearly four dollars he made his entire library on, I suspect the result would be something that looked vaguely similar to the film &quot;Nightbeast;&quot; wooden actors, terrible effects, confusing dialogue, and plot holes large enough to drive a semi through.  \n\nThe Nightbeast is an alien with a brown head and fangs, who crash lands his space ship on earth in the opening moments of the film.  He then goes on a rampage killing anyone in sight.  The remainder of the movie finds our &quot;hero,&quot; Sheriff Cinder, hunting the beast, while bedding coworkers and trudging through subplots that mean nothing to anyone in or out of the film.\n\nThis so-called Nightbeast is a fascinating creature.  He arrives on earth, and begins his rampage, and throughout the film, no motive is given for the carnage, no explanation provided for his origin or his reason for coming to earth.  And none of the characters seem to care, or appear at all surprised that a murderous beast with bad dental work is on the loose.  They try to kill it sure, but mostly out of simple survival instinct not even fear of the alien hordes as many a paranoid horror film has shown.  The Nightbeast appears primarily during the day (Maybe his name is supposed to be a post-ironic commentary on our society?) and never speaks a word of dialogue. A shame too; he seems like he has a lot on his mind.\n\nWhen Nightbeast hits the town, he first has a small raygun that he uses to dissolve humans away into nothing.  He is so trigger happy (And presumably his gun has unlimited ammo) that he just blasts without aiming, and there are scenes filled with literally hundreds of lasers whizzing around our not-so-intrepid heroes who fire at it with their handguns showing on their faces a mixture of extreme heroism and idiocy.  Of course, we later learn that the Nightbeast (Whose one weakness is electricity...funny that it doesn&apos;t like being electrocuted, SO creative) actually uses the humans for his food, begging the question if he needs to eat us to survive, then why use a raygun that destroys all trace of the humans leaving nothing to eat? \n\n The film includes some wife-beating subplots that go nowhere, and a sex scene painful in both the unattractive nature of the participants and in the silliness of the dialogue (Example line: &quot;You know I could take my shirt off...&quot;  Response: &quot;And I could take my towel off.&quot;)  And what kind of women completely undresses in front of her coworker with whom she&apos;s never shared a romantic encounter with in her life?  She tells him she&apos;s going to take a shower then strips right in front of the guy!  Did I mention he&apos;s got a salt-and-pepper curly afro and huge seventies glasses?  Yeah, he&apos;s the action hero.\n\nLunacy of this caliber is often hard to come by.  And Nightbeast truly fits that description.  It won&apos;t be easy to secure yourself a copy, but it will be well worth the effort if you can.  And watch out for those stupid, big-teethed aliens.  Cause you never know..."

Killing the bounty hunter, he takes his father&apos;s body into town to claim the reward, where he&apos;s informed by ambitious local Fernando Sancho, that his dad was actually quite wealthy and set up by his greedy business partner. The two then team up with a mystery man, carrying a switchblade stiletto cane, to take on the murderous big-shot.\n\nDjango Shoots First is another colorful, fast-paced spaghetti western. There isn&apos;t much new here, but it&apos;s a pleasantly entertaining way to spend an hour and a half, with an adequate amount of action, plot-twists, and gun-wielding heavies.\n\nThere&apos;s also a good score by Ennio Morricone&apos;s frequent collaborator Bruno Nicolai and a neat early cameo in the film&apos;s final scene, by Italian genre favorite George Eastman, who&apos;s minus his distinctive facial hair.",

Since the latter is not likely to impact it, I suspect it is the former.\n\nAnd that is just too bad. Despite the lampooning, this is a decent film with good effects (the gland), a better than average plot and decent acting. We have John Carradine, a legendary actor and Carradine family patriarch. And he is surrounded by actresses who had been Miss America, a Playboy Playmate (around the same time the film came out) and more...\n\nThe script? From a man who went on to write some of the best episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Certainly this cannot be as bad as it is made out to be. Another examination may be in order.",

There is decent FX, the story is easy enough to follow but with major flaw. A documentary is about a subject and not about the documentary maker so that&apos;s where the film could lost me and weakened the premise of the film entirely. If the camera were to be the main character, I think the film would have been more palatable for myself.\n\nEven with this weakness the effort to try to make a film of this style is appreciated.",

He also says that he&apos;s acquired the ability to kill by merely shouting.\n\nAnthony doubts the story, so, Charles takes him out and proves it to him. Unfortunately for Rachel, Charles has even more wickedness up his sleeve.\n\nTHE SHOUT is a magnificently odd little film about magic, madness, and death. It&apos;s told via flashback in a mental institution.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of the dark and different... Be sure to watch for Tim Curry!"

However, she gets nowhere until she&apos;s noticed by famous movie star Norman Maine (Fredric March), a performer on his way down in terms of popular appeal. The two fall in love but just as Ester&apos;s star, under the stage name Vicki Lester begins to rise, Maine&apos;s begins to fade.\n\nThe best thing about this film is the performance given by Fredric March as actor Norman Maine. He nails the inner emotional turmoil going on inside his character and makes him always sympathetic to the viewer even as Maine falls in and out of sobriety. It&apos;s Maine&apos;s character that proves most interesting to the viewer here as March completely steals the film away from star Janet Gaynor.\n\nGaynor doesn&apos;t prove quite as appealing or convincing in her lead role as Ester Blodgett/Vicki Lester and honestly it&apos;s hard to see why the public should favor her so. Maybe this was to symbolize the fickleness of the public in that they should prefer a pretty new face over a talented older one. Who knows? Nevertheless Gaynor just doesn&apos;t ever prove as appealing here in her role as she should.",

      "reviewBody": "A safari hunter drifts across the starched heat of the African plains, stealthily prowling amongst the tall grass, the scorching shimmering sunlight falls upon the shadows of predatorial lions, hungry hippos and the gleaming jaws of the crocodile. A vinyl recording of 60s rock &apos;n&apos; roll echoing over time through generations suggest a nostalgic remembrance of a distant land, which later plays a greater significance in a saga of unrequited love, regret and (literally) life and death.\n\nInitially, Tabu is a love story in disguise, a unfinished love story sprawling over a lifetime of passion, regret, duty and propriety. In it&apos;s latter stages it contemplates ideas of memory, unrequited love, ageing, class inequality, prejudice, and European colonialism in African hills and plains.\n\nThe first part follows the life of an enigmatic elderly woman in contemporary Portugal - titled Paradise Lost - as she goes about her daily life, we learn snippets about her about her prosaic hobbies, simple pleasures, prejudices, idiosyncrasies, detests, and regrets over a sobering simple lifestyle, a long way from the dream life she idolised. Her simple pleasures have allowed her to gamble away her savings and her estranged family by doing so; in her current state, she had little left except her dedicated maid and carer Pilar who initially acts as the audience&apos;s eyes and ears into the portrait of a solitary woman.\n\nWhat is the intriguing background to this lady&apos;s prime of beauty and youth? The modern landscape of metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal is industrial, bleak and sobering, at times sad and efficient, a far world from that which she inhabited in her youth. It is not long until what find out the origins of her melancholy and frustration, and what exactly has been trying to atone for most of her later life.\n\nSo begins a tale in colonial Africa, a tale of love and betrayal, rock &apos;n&apos; roll, diamonds, and an alligator. This second part, subtitled Paradise is almost silent with only diegetic sound imposed during key moments with no title cards as far as I can remember. It is a wonderfully romantic and nostalgic yet with an undercurrent on living the edge of a precipice - the dangerous beasts of the African plains, the wild unfamiliar natives and rugged landscape - there exists a sense of tragedy combined with high passion, regret and wild party impulses.\n\nWhereas part one is melancholic as it is bitter and comic, the second part contrasts the beauty of youth, the blinding African heat and sun, it exposes the storytelling medium the by abandoning almost all dialogue and all but some diegetic sound effects. The compositions and framing are gorgeous, a simple story of unrequited love requiring little explanation and is suggested by moods, looks, and atmosphere and nostalgic memories. The economy in telling a story almost wordlessly, embraces the feelings and mood of silent storytelling placing the onus of eliciting emotion on the charismatic and effortless performances. From the frustrating, fussy and capricious Aurora to the charismatic, carefree, jeunesse Ventura and the supporting jaunty characters, each signify the contrasts in class, social status and the colonial class system soon to collapse under political revolution.\n\nWhat is essentially an unrequited love story /melodrama is a charismatic and rollicking passionate ride with some crystal sharp compositions in textured black and white. This is an impressive, technically creative, charismatic, heartbreaking, melancholic and nostalgic film; perhaps more daring and arguably less conventional than that other lauded silent film of last year. Tabu is gorgeously unpredictable, surprising and artful.",

Astonishingly, my wife, who is a Ballet Teacher, doesn&apos;t care at all for this film finding it too &apos;affected&apos;. Perhaps as I am not involved with ballet at a professional level is a reason why I can enjoy this vibrant, colourful fantasy so much, but then our ballet friends adore the film, so who knows why this film affects some so profoundly (Spielberg&amp;Scorsese!!) and not others. Anton Walbrook&apos;s authoritative performance is so memorable and Moira Shearer dances beautifully. Perhaps because the film is so highly charged with passion and emotion it will never please everyone, but I feel this is one of the great achievements of British Cinema and a film so rich and inspirational you will never wish to forget it.",

This is the real world of child protection. You deal with a druggie mother today, a pederast grandfather tomorrow, and neglected or abused children the next day. \n\nSome may find the language off-putting, but that is the way it is. You are under such stress during work, that you have to relieve it somehow after you get off. It may be crude, but it is effective.\n\nI can also relate to those who lose it occasionally. You can put your heart and soul into this job, and get frustrated easily by parents and the bureaucracy.\n\nThe film may have been actors, but it has a documentary feel as they portray the action as it really happens.",

      "reviewBody": "The BTS short subject directed by crew member Kristal Mosley proves to be more interesting than the &quot;award-winning&quot; (fake AVN accolades) &quot;Afrodite Superstar&quot;, a banal success story whose hook is both Black and female empowerment. The auteur using &quot;Venus Hottentot&quot; as a stage name (or Venus Baartman as alternate, taken from famous exploited 19th Century African woman Sarah Baartman/Venus Hottentot) has concocted a clichéd script that fails to develop the relationships in a feature lasting little more than an hour including the XXX content directed by the late, great Candida Royalle. Slow, slow end credits pad out the running time.\n\nSimone Valentino, who expresses credible apprehension at doing explicit sex in her BTS interview, is appealing in the title role, a rich girl who is given the Pygmalion treatment by hip-hop music label mogul Mr. Marcus to become an overnight success as rap star MC Dytie. It all predictably is revealed to be not a talent discovery but rather a gift engineered by her rich daddy who owns Marcus&apos;s label.\n\nPorn veteran India is effective and upstages the heroine as her BFF who is also a budding rap singer and poet. Cast and crew protest defensively in the BTS how they want to avoid the Black stereotypes and clichés of porn, but unfortunately this film merely substitutes many familiar clichés of the rap/hip hop world. With condoms and zero money shots, Candida-staged sex scenes are effective but I failed to notice any real difference from those dreaded &quot;exploitative&quot; scenes familiar from mainstream porn -just leaving out the gonzo excesses doesn&apos;t constitute an improvement over the Romantic Couples content of so many earlier Adam &amp; Eve releases.\n\nThe supporting characters are paper-thin, including a silly blond white boy (played by Jay Junker) as Road Dawg who is Afrodite&apos;s &quot;dialect coach&quot; (teaching her Ebonics replete with explanatory sub-titles) and gets to have an all-white sex scene atop a Humvee, or Liliana Velasquez as Kai, the stylist, who gets sack time with porn veteran Justin Long. Justin is named Criminal, a bald rap star who proclaims his four-year hitch in the joint which we find out comically is actually undergrad years at Yale, something he&apos;s ashamed of due to &quot;Street Cred&quot; topsy- turvy values (a comment on the whole &quot;being Black&quot; issue of avoidance of supposedly acting too &quot;white&quot;).\n\nSo Venus and Candida earn many brownie points for attempting a sort of breakthrough, but I found it more revealing when in the BTS Candida admits to having wanted to make a film for &quot;the ethnic market&quot;, more truthful and film biz-practical than all the do-gooder platitudes expressed."

The Trigger Effect opens up &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; style with a wonderful sequence of no name actors who end up playing a huge role on the story line of what the Trigger Effect is. Almost by mistake, we are brought into the lives of the main characters, and from there the story begins. The movie holds some amazing moments and some excellent scenes with the 3 leads. Still, the movie falls short with an ending, nobody wanted to see. A thriller that builds and builds and builds and goes nowhere. The struggle between the characters grow and then end up going off on a detour and nothing else. Sad, the movie could have been a timeless story how the slightest things in our day could end up killing ourselves if not killing others. The story was terrific and could have been an excellent movie. But overall, the movie is worth watching just for the moments it has.",

I was confused in the beginning, when they all rode up in a bus, but I later caught on. Other than that the movie was great, the voices were great, (especially Judas, he really added anger and sorrow to his part) and the setting was perfect. I found it humorous when there were the anachronisms such as grenades and guns at the market. This was a great movie and I will watch it again and again. I am normally skeptical of musicals but I will always hold this close to my heart. This movie should be seen by anyone, and everyone. Peace!"

The movie makes no moral judgements about bad guys and good guys and simply shows the characters of both sides a path to redemption in the midst of war. In addition, the theme song, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; is rendered with a youthful tone by the Mike Curb Congregation, which reminds us that in reality, people not much removed from childhood are the ones sent into battle.\n\nWe cheer when they get their just rewards."

I don&apos;t think her talent gets the recognition it deserves and this is sadly due to the fact that this and one other film, 1925&apos;s &quot;The Unchastened Woman&quot; actually survive to my knowledge. Ms. Bara was the ultimate femme fatale and this is clearly seen in this film, her first starring role. Her film career was relatively short and many of her films were the tragic result of deteriation that so many of the early nitrate films were subject to. This makes film preservation a very vital movement so that many movie icons, such as Ms. Bara can be preserved for posterity.",

      "reviewBody": "13 Ghosts is a real classic haunted house style ghost story. Films like this wouldn&apos;t do very well these days (hence the reason the remake is so different) as the chills mostly come in the form of wind whistling through windows and pots being thrown off kitchen shelves; things which wouldn&apos;t scare people anymore. However, it&apos;s delightful to see a film like this - especially one directed by one of the kings of horror entertainment; William Castle. 13 Ghosts works from the assumption that its audience wants to believe in ghosts; and the result is a cheerful little flick that Castle manages to steer away from patronisation and keep firmly within the realms of the fun horror film. The story is halfway between a tale of ghosts and a story about mad science, and we follow a family who find themselves between a rock and a hard place when the repossession men take their furniture and the father&apos;s uncle dies, leaving them his house. However, he dabbled in the occult; and the house that he&apos;s left his nephew&apos;s family is filled with ghosts! \n\nHot on the heels of his successes with Vincent Price starring films, The Tingler and House on Haunted Hill; 13 Ghosts is another gimmicky film with over the top special effects, and once again Castle does a great job of entertaining the audience. The plot doesn&apos;t have a lot of originality, but it doesn&apos;t matter because it&apos;s successful where it counts. The family are shown as the classic American set up of a father, mother, daughter and son; and they&apos;re all very easy to get on with, which makes both of the &apos;evil&apos; subplots easy to buy into. The special effects are one of the most notable things about this film. William Castle clearly doesn&apos;t subscribe to the idea of &apos;less is more&apos;, and 13 Ghosts shows that quite clearly. The ghosts here leave nothing to the imagination, and I was very happy with that as the main reason I don&apos;t usually like ghost stories is that they take too long to get going. This one doesn&apos;t suffer from that, and although it&apos;s a bit silly at times - 13 Ghosts is a real good time, and comes highly recommended to all!",

      "reviewBody": "When I was in college, my film class buddies and I would sometimes joke about creating a film festival called The Very Foreign, Foreign Film Series, dedicated to the most impenetrable of foreign films. I think Miklos Jancso&apos;s Agnus Dei could have played opening night.\n\nThere are some who will try to bluff their way through a review of a movie they did not understand. I am not one of those.\n\nI have admired some of Miklos Jancso&apos;s other films. I especially liked The Round-Up. I know that Jancso finds much inspiration for his film from Hungary&apos;s past, a past about which I know very little. I also know that Jancso is known for long takes with moving cameras. Some of these shots can be breathtaking. There are such shots in Agnus Dei as well. I was carried along by the film&apos;s motion for about the first half, but then I became increasingly restless and confused.\n\nThe first Miklos Jancso film I ever watched was The Red and The White. I remember being slightly confused about which side was which and about the way both sides committed nasty acts. Agnus Dei is somewhat similar. The film is set in 1919 during a leftist rebellion against landowners. What I got out of watching it is, that unlike The Red Army in the previous film, the leftists here were trying to fight honorably, but were doomed to lose because the other side was completely ruthless.\n\nTake for instance the priest character. He is on the side of the landowners and also seems somewhat mad. He is captured by the leftists, but then let go. This turns out to be a big mistake because the priest is not as merciful as the leftists. All of that I understood, while wondering if there was more to all of this than I was getting. However, the final third becomes frustratingly vague.\n\nThere is young man with a violin who appears about halfway. Whose side is he on? I don&apos;t know. He seems to be for and against both sides. The film climaxes with this giant bonfire that might be intended as symbolic. Then, there is a final twist of the knife involving that young man with the violin that just had me scratching my head. Agnus Dei is certainly not a viewer friendly film.\n\nOn the other hand, Miklos Jancso can shoot a nice-looking tracking shot. There are some good ones here.",

It&apos;s not a billon dollar pick, but it has some nice special effects. You will see some familiar faces when they were young, and the acting they really tired. I liked the movie, and hope it sparks the fire that leads someone to become a &quot;timerider&quot;. I would not say run out and buy it, but if someone has a old VHS of it, watch it! I think even hardcore si-fi fans like me will get a kick out of it. Maybe its just me, but I thought the soundtrack was pretty good. It fit the mood of the movie. Only downside is there is a lot of rerun footage."

Yes it&apos;s a CGi fest but as compared to 2000s era movies it is good to watch.\n\nCharacter performances &amp; music score is I like the most specially the suit design looks great to watch.\n\nDirector has taken the freedom in the storyline and present the unique style of it sort of imagination fantasy and the visuals it create makes my day.\n\nOverall not a must watch but still feel good film with a space ride venture and great character performances...",

But above all, it&apos;s Peter Sellers who shows his talent here. How an earlier reviewer manages to call this &apos;a dud&apos; is beyond me.\n\nSo the movie loses its pace a bit at the end - maybe trying to underline too much what a nice fellow Bakshi is. But there&apos;s a lot of great scenes - the army attack, the parrot, the dinner and that incredible toilet scene. The increasingly drunken waiter (a convincing performance, who is that actor?). And through it all, Bakshi wanders around with that eternal smile on his face.\n\nSellers manages to combine The Pink Panther&apos;s slapstick with a sympathetic character of more depth. Great humour!"

I do like the mecha aspect, but it&apos;s the human dynamic captured by this film that sets it above all others. All I&apos;m going to say, though, is that if I were Yuki Mori, I would have found another love interest sometime before the film begins.  But hey, that&apos;s me.  It&apos;s true that this film aroused such a response in Japan that the Comet Empire series was made to meet audience demand.  An issue of the comic (yeah, okay, I&apos;m a real geek) explained the various scenarios depending on what storyline you&apos;re following.  Thus this film is both the end and an interesting diversion.  Take your pick."

      "reviewBody": "WE OWN THE NIGHT is the quote from the lower portion of the badge on the uniforms of NYPD police family Deputy Chief Bert Grusinsky (Robert Duvall) and one of his two sons Capt. Joe Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg): the other son Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) did not follow the family tradition of police work but instead is involved in nightclubs - and yes there is a schism of resentment. Bobby has distanced himself further from his family by changing his last name to &apos;Green&apos;, living with a Puerto Rican girl Amada (Eva Mendes), and bonding to a wealthy Russian family who owns the nightclub where Bobby works - a front for a drug dealing business. Writer/Director James Gray (&apos;The Yards&apos; and &apos;Little Odessa&apos;) has a feel for this underbelly of New York City and captures the 1988 mood of life in the city and beneath the city with style. The problem with the story is that it has been done so many times that it is simply stale yesterday&apos;s lunch. Two brothers at opposite end of the family spectrum require a major tragedy to bring them together, and to offer any more information to this fairly thin plot would be a disservice to those who plan to see the film.\n\nThe cast is strong, partly because each of them has played similar roles countless times and have the ideas down pat. It should be noted that two of the producers of the film are Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix, probably a reason the film was made... There are some exciting moments and enough surprises and tense times to keep the adrenaline rolling, the smaller roles are very well cast, and one of the shining attributes of the film is the gorgeous Russian liturgy inspired musical score by Wojciech Kilar. It is not a bad film; it is just too much in the same mold as countless other New York police dramas. Grady Harp",

      "name": "Perhaps the Best of Universal&apos;s Sherlock Holmes Films",
      "reviewBody": "Universal&apos;s Sherlock Holmes series brought the characters into the 20th Century. Many of the were related to World War II, stories in which Holmes went in pursuit of spies and counterspies; others tried to mimic the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories with a presentation of mental puzzles. Although generally well executed, seldom did any of the titles rise above the level of &quot;B Pictures&quot;--but on the rare occasions that they did, they did so with a vengeance, and THE SCARLET CLAW is such a case. Directed at a fast clip by Roy William Neill, memorably photographed by George Robinson, and sporting an expert cast in a particularly clever script, this is easily among the best of the series.\n\nThe story hearkens back to such titles as THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. Lord Penrose (Paul Cavanaugh) is convinced that his small, Canadian town is beset by an evil spirit--and is indeed giving a lecture on psychic phenomena when his wife is found murdered, presumably by a apparition that haunted the town many years before. Convinced that it is the work of an otherwordly being, he does not welcome the arrival of Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), who is convinced that there is nothing ghostly about the matter in the least.\n\nThe Universal films counted a great deal on the chemistry between Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and sidekick Dr. Watson, and indeed that chemistry is on full display in this particular title. But the overall cast is remarkably fine, not only the aforementioned Cavanaugh but most particularly Gerald Hammer, who frequently appeared in these films and here offers a uniquely memorable turn as the fearful postmaster. And, unlike most other films in the series, the solution to the crime is indeed a shocker.\n\nThe restoration is very handsome and the DVD comes with two nice bonuses, a short documentary on the challenges faced by those who restored the series (THE SCARLET CLAW receives particular mention) and an erudite audio commentary by film historian David Stuart Davies. If you&apos;ve seen one or two films in the series and been unimpressed--give this one a try to see what Rathbone and company could do when when they had all the right makings. Recommended.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer",

They stop in a gas station where Adam and Bill woo the attendant Courtney (Rebecca Da Costa) and when they return to the road, the driver sees a mysterious woman on the road and crashes the van on a tree. \n\nThe driver dies and the group of strangers is helped by Jack (Ving Rhames) that invites them to go to his house since a storm is coming. Adam meets Courtney with her broken car on the road and she joins the group. Soon they find that they are trapped in the house that is inhabited by ghosts. Further they learn that one hundred years ago a family was slaughtered by their insane son and they can see the boy killing his family again and again.\n\n&quot;Seven Below&quot; is a senseless and lame ghost story and one of the worst horror movies that I have ever seen. The plot is an awful rip-off of the storyline of Claude Chabrol&apos;s &quot;Alice ou la Dernière Fugue&quot;, with a car crash on a tree and the character trapped in a house.\n\nGhost stories are usually attractive, but unfortunately &quot;Seven Below&quot; does not make any sense. The characters are poorly developed and Val Kilmer and Ving Rhames are absolutely decadent in their careers. My vote is two.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Sete Almas&quot; (&quot;Seven Souls&quot;)",

I love that they were more connected to fans than other bands up to that point, because the world of rock creates stars and idols and that is not necessary.\n\nThere is something odd about British folks singing about the subjugation of Native Americans. I wish this has been addressed more, but maybe it is not an important story for how the album was created...",

      "reviewBody": "Rika Nishina (Megumi Okina) works for a social services agency in Tokyo, although she&apos;s never seen any clients. When a new case comes in and they&apos;re short on staff, her boss has to send her out. Her first case is a doozy. When she enters the client&apos;s home, no one seems to be there, and the house is a mess. She hears scraping on a door--the old woman she is to care for is there, but in a semi-catatonic state. Soon after, she learns that there is much more wrong than bad housekeeping and a neglected old woman. There just may be threatening supernatural forces behind the scenes.\n\nThis film is really the third in the Japanese Ju-On series. I won&apos;t usually watch a series out of order, but this is the only Ju-On film officially and thus easily available in the U.S. I was very anxious to watch the American remake, The Grudge (2004), and actually watched it the day before watching this film.\n\nThe first 40-something minutes are closest to the American remake, but it was surprising that this film is much more linear. It&apos;s also more episodic. Neither of those facts are negative here, and both lend to a somewhat easier understanding of the broader mythology behind the Ju-On &quot;monsters&quot;, which is presented much more clearly in this film. However, the episodic nature also means that the viewer has to pay attention to the various characters and their names, or there is a good chance that one will get lost--this story touches on many different people, in many different scenarios. Occasionally, there are characters brought into each other&apos;s episodes, sometimes as subtly as a name mentioned in a news report. These cross-references, which can also slightly break the linear timeline, are effective if one is alert.\n\nThere are things that writer/director Takashi Shimizu does better in this version, and things he does better in the American version. In this version, I loved the brutal opening sequence. Although it&apos;s somewhat present towards the end of the American version, it is much more effective here. I enjoyed the more traditional Japanese home--this film was shot on location in an actual house, whereas the American remake was shot on a house constructed on a soundstage. The Japanese house is more claustrophobic. On the other hand, the soundstage house was a bit grungier, which works nicely in the context of the remake. I liked this film&apos;s transition in the famous &quot;stair crawling&quot; scene (although I thought the flashbacks weren&apos;t necessary), and I also loved some of the more dissonant music here.\n\nThe biggest differences occur after the first forty minutes, when Shimizu expands the number of monsters. The film seems to threaten a Romero-like plague that I&apos;d like to see explored more in other Ju-On films (if that hasn&apos;t been done already).\n\nThe bottom line though is that this is a nicely atmospheric horror film, with a creepy scene per minute. There were a couple very minor flaws--occasionally awkward performances or editing being the primary one, but overall this is highly recommended. It earned a 9 out of 10 from me.",

For what Python was doing then, was not only genius what probably the funniest act on television to the date. So, before you act critical, think again. This is what motivated much of the sketch comedy we see on television today."

We won&apos;t even look at her mother&apos;s relationship with this elegant man.  There! i hope i&apos;ve given you enough of a hook to take it in, whether you speak French or like subtitles or not.

How will the rent be paid?  And the loan of the taxi?  What is going on in the mind of our son who does only look television and eat until he becomes fat?

      "reviewBody": "The last Gus Van Sant movie I saw was &apos;Elephant&apos;, a film that did not work for me. Thankfully he is back with &apos;Milk&apos; which pretty much gives a detailed account of the rise of Harvey Milk and his martyrdom. Van Sant uses live footage between scenes which reminds one of how much harsher the world once was to people who were &apos;different&apos;. The writing is stupendous and the dialogues are especially effective. The portrayal of the characters are very human. There is no hero or villain. There are just humans with flaws, humans fighting for what they believe in. Van Sant sets a tense and chaotic tone right from the beginning. The 70s atmosphere is well created through makeup and costumes. The use of brownish tinted light may arise nostalgia. It is two remarkable performances that make &apos;Milk&apos; stand out: Sean Penn&apos;s very accurate and nuanced portrayal of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin&apos;s layered portrayal of a complex Dan White. I doubt &apos;Milk&apos; would have been effective enough if it weren&apos;t for such strong acting. The director deserves mention for his brilliant work. Movies like &apos;Milk&apos; are relevant today because they serve as a reminder of how difficult life once was and how people fought against it and lives were sacrificed in order to create a better society for those living in today&apos;s world."

It felt like it was it&apos;s own film and not just a carbon copy of all other superhero style films out there, it actually took time to build a sense of mystery and develop the characters rather than just rushing from one plot point to the next.\n\nI felt like I got to know the main character and was intrigued to see more of the movie universe unlike many forgettable action/sci-fi movies out there.\n\nIf you go into the film expecting non-stop action sequences go watch the avengers, if you want something with a little mystery and gradual exploration of that mystery watch this",

To look after this, the fabled &quot;Puma man&quot; (constantly miss-pronounced, rather aptly, as &quot;poo-ma man&quot; ) is entrusted to prevent it from falling into evil hands. Alas, a team of archaeologists in bondage gear find the mask and set off on world domination.\n\nNeed I go on? Nothing in this movie makes sense. Who cares if the hero&apos;s sidekick pushed a bunch of Americans to their deaths for no obvious reason! Poo-ma man&apos;s powers include dangling in front of London&apos;s skyline, posing like a squirrel and leaping around with 80&apos;s synthesized &quot;boing&quot; noises, and walking through walls - all the abilities you would expect from your average south-American feral wildcat.\n\nOh what&apos;s the point of going on. This movie is so bad, it bounces off the bottom depths of the chasm of suckness back up into the realms of inadvertent hysteria. Cue 80&apos;s disco music and, &quot;Poo- ma man, he flies like a mor-on!&quot;",

But keeping things in perspective, this movie is not one of his better movies by far. 80s was the era where the stardom, style of Amitabh overshadowed the actor. Movie makers made movies with him less for the content and more to take advantage of his super stardom. His co stars were just there as part of the ambiance. Randhir Kapoor to a lesser extent but Zeenat Aman and Tina Munim&apos;s presence were barely felt in the movie, except for a couple of songs. This movie like others was made as a one man show. Back in the days nobody thought twice of it, but today when we watch this and many like it movies, we roll our eyes and change the channel. Not surprisingly, this signified the beginning of the end of Amitabh&apos;s superstardom status. I wouldn&apos;t put this movie on the top of my must watch list.",

She has great comic timing, and always goes just far enough for the laugh, and usually not too far that it feels staged or unnatural.\n\nFrom the reviews I read, I was really expecting not to like the &quot;Julie&quot; half of this movie--but I was pleasantly surprised. I read both &quot;Julie and Julia&quot; and &quot;My Life in France&quot; earlier this summer, and I have to confess that I didn&apos;t love the Julie Powell book. Amy Adams really brings this character to life and makes you care about her (more so, I think than the book did). One problem with the balance in this project is that Julia Child did something really important for cooking in America, and so her story is inherently interesting. Julie Powell wrote a book. That became a movie. Add to that the fact that the heavy hitters in the film all live on the Julia side--Streep, Stanley Tucci, and a great cameo by Jane Lynch--and the deck feels fully stacked. Full credit to Amy Adams and Chris Messina, then, for making us care about the half of the film that teetered on the edge of the perfunctory.\n\nThis film is all the more remarkable in that it is so rare to see a film these days that just revels in joie-de-vivre. I&apos;m sure a lot of the rough edges of Julia&apos;s personality are smoothed over--but some of the stressful moments are there. I just felt so much affection for Streep&apos;s Julia Child in this movie--and I laughed repeatedly and heartily at her antics. A fun time at the movies--which is a rarer pleasure than it should be.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; is Brian De Palma&apos;s outrageous blend of horror, comedy and rock opera very loosely based on Gaston Leroux&apos;s immortal novel &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. I know it is hard to think of a musical horror movie without thinking about &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, but De Palma strikes first with this more horror-oriented (although still hysterically funny) satire on the music industry of the 70s.\n\nSwan (Paul Williams) is a powerful and legendary music producer who is making preparations for his greatest triumph in music business: The Paradise, a monster auditorium that will serve him as palace. To inaugurate his palace, he is looking for the perfect sound and he fins it in the music of Winslow Leach (William Finley), a young composer who dreams with presenting his &quot;Faust&quot; cantata to the world. Swan steals Leach&apos;s work and in an accident, deforms his face turning Leach into The Phantom. Now, as the masked monster, the Phantom will try to stop Swan&apos;s plans by sabotaging the Paradise.\n\nThe movie is a visually and musically impressive rock opera with a healthy dose of horror and tongue-in-cheek humor. Brian De Palma cleverly conjures the basic outline of Leroux&apos;s novel and add elements of his other influences making the movie a subtle yet moving tribute to the books/movies/music he loves. The modernization and the change from opera to rock work surprisingly good and despite of being a bit outdated by now, the music (by Paul Williams) still makes one of the best soundtracks in a horror film.\n\nDe Palma continues improving his technique in this film and like in the previous &quot;Sisters&quot;, his style shows maturity and a definitive trademark. Often labeled as a Hitchcock-imitator, I believe that De Palma simply likes to pay constant tribute to his influences, and this film serves a proof of that. Elements of Welles, Hitchcock, Murneau, Whale and Wienne are all over the picture, yet &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; is like none of the works of those directors.\n\nPaul Williams not only composed the soundtrack, he also stars as Swan, the dark and evil genius that leads Death Records and ultimately uses Leach&apos;s music for his own purposes. His performance is superb and while not physically imposing he is truly one of the best villains I&apos;ve ever seen. Finley&apos;s take on the Phantom is, like most of the modern interpretations of the character, a romantic tragic figure; but Finley recovers some of the original horror characteristics of the novel creating an attractive but still menacing monster.\n\nJessica Harper, who would achieve fame in Dario Argento&apos;s &quot;Suspiria&quot;, gives a good performance as Phoenix, the young singer that captures both Swan and Leach&apos;s attention. Like she would do in &quot;Suspiria&quot;, she adds depth to the role of the naive singer who wants nothing but to triumph. Something remarkable is the fact that she sang all her songs and did it with credibility and talent. Last but not least, Gerrit Graham portrays a Bowie-inspired Glam rock diva in the unforgettable role of rock superstar Beef.\n\nSadly, not everything is perfect in Paradise, and neither is in this movie. The odd mixture of musical and horror works very good but at times the movie gets a bit too serious to pass as a musical or too silly to pass as a horror film. It&apos;s not a surprise that &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; gained more recognition as it keeps both genres perfectly in equilibrium in all its flamboyant runtime. Still, this is a minor flaw that keeps the movie away from perfection.\n\nMaybe I had low expectations or maybe I was just in the right mood, but &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; was a pleasant surprise that I would not hesitate to recommend to fans of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; or fans of black comedy in general. 8/10",

Now knowing Josh Hutcherson was playing the lead role I immediately wanted to see it do to his outstanding proformacen in &quot; Bridge To Teribethia &quot;.\n\nThe movie isn&apos;t so much about ther dog it is more about the realtionship between a son and a father. And they do have there moment on the big screen.\n\nThis movie is emotional,Funny,enjoyable and one of the best movies of the year. \n\nIt is a family movie and a great script,casting,acting.etc.\n\nThis isn&apos;t a Oscar winning movie. But a good a enough movie to keep awake and istresed. \n\nYou see it !!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "This Signal Corps documentary of the American Army&apos;s involvement in the First World War was released some time after the Armistice -- at least, this version of it was -- because it shows the troops reacting to the news.\n\nBy the time the Second World War had rolled around, the Signal Corps knew how to get a propaganda film made: commission Frank Capra and turn him loose. Soon he had a wealth of talent including John Huston, William Wyler, George Stevens, Anatol Litvak, William Hornbeck, Walter Huston.... anyone he wanted was anxious to help out. Things were not so easy during the First World War. True, D.W. Griffith had gone over at the request of the British government -- a situation mocked in one of John Buchan&apos;s thrillers, in which Richard Hannay winds up directing a battle scene. Still, the question was how to tell the story.\n\nBy the time this was ready for release, it was all over but part of the shouting. So this became a story of achievement: not &apos;Why We Fight&apos; but &apos;How We Fought&apos;, laying down railroads in the mud, shelling German positions with over a million shells in four hours, with occasional breaks to shave and eat bakery rolls.\n\nSome of the shots of pilots look a lot like ones from WINGS.",

      "name": "Just What Were They On?",
      "reviewBody": "Just what were they on? &quot;Barbarella&quot; is one of those sixties films (the Beatles vehicle &quot;Help!&quot; is another) which, although it makes no explicit references to the decade&apos;s drug culture, nevertheless leaves the indelible impression that the director, the scriptwriter, the set designer, the costume designer, the cameramen and most of the cast were under the influence of mind-expanding drugs throughout the entire shooting period.\n\nI first saw the film at university in the early eighties when a student film society organised a screening. Interest in it at that time may have been aroused by the release in 1980 of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, another ultra-camp science fiction film which was undoubtedly influenced by it, and by the fact that one of the leading British pop groups of the era had called themselves Duran Duran in homage to their origins in a now-defunct Birmingham nightclub called Barbarella&apos;s.\n\nThe film is based on a French series of comic books, which I must admit I have never read. (Unlike, say, the &quot;Asterix&quot; or &quot;Tintin&quot; series, the Barbarella comics have never had much of a following in Britain). The action takes place in the 40th century. Barbarella, a beautiful young female astronaut, is ordered by the President of Earth to travel to the planet Tau Ceti to find a scientist named Durand Durand, from whom the band took their misspelled name. Durand is the inventor of a weapon known as the Positronic Ray, which the President fears may fall into the wrong hands.\n\nThe rest of the film is taken up with Barbarella&apos;s increasingly bizarre adventures on Tau Ceti. She goes ice-skiing across the planet&apos;s frozen surface, pulled along by an octopus-like creature, is menaced by flesh-eating dolls with razor-sharp teeth, seduces a blind angel (or &quot;ornithanthrope&quot;), meets the predatory lesbian Queen of a decadent city and survives an attempted execution by means of an &quot;orgasmatron&quot;, a machine designed to kill by an excess of sexual pleasure. (Barbarella&apos;s capacity for sexual pleasure is so great that she blows its circuits). We are not, of course, meant to take any of this seriously; the whole thing is intended as a sort of tongue-in-cheek exercise in high camp surrealism, Salvador Dali meets Edna Everage. The surreal nature of the film is emphasised by the use of psychedelic lighting effects. (The opening song even includes the rhyme &quot;Barbarella Psychedella&quot;).\n\nBarbarella is played by Jane Fonda, who at the time was married to the director Roger Vadim, clearly a man with the knack of attracting beautiful women. (He had previously been married to Brigitte Bardot and had been the lover of Catherine Deneuve). I wonder if, when Fonda was taking her wedding vows, she realised that Vadim&apos;s interpretation of &quot;for better or for worse&quot; included casting his wife in eccentric films like this one. Her devotion to her wifely duties seems to have been at the expense of her career; she later revealed that her commitment to &quot;Barbarella&quot; meant having to turn down the leading roles in two more serious films, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot;. Moreover, many of the heroine&apos;s adventures seem to have been designed with the express purpose of showing off Fonda&apos;s figure in a series of provocative outfits, leaving her with a lasting &quot;sex kitten&quot; image. This was something she was never comfortable with, especially when she was trying to reinvent herself as a feminist and left-wing activist a few years later.\n\nThis is far from being Fonda&apos;s best film, yet she is about the only cast member who emerges with any credit from it, playing the heroine as a sort of wide-eyed innocent abroad. John Phillip Law, who plays the ornithanthrope Pygar, is so wooden that I wondered if he was under instructions to play his role with a deliberately deadpan lack of emotion. David Hemmings as the resistance leader Dildano shows us just why his career never really took off in the way it was expected to after his early breakthrough in &quot;Blowup&quot;. (Hemmings&apos;s costume, looking like a pair of leather Y-fronts, is just as bizarre as anything worn by Fonda). Marcel Marceau shows that his talents as a mime did not extend to acting in spoken roles. Anita Pallenberg, better known for her relationships with several members of the Rolling Stones, was cast as the wicked Queen, but Vadim did not trust her to speak her own lines; the Queen speaks with the unmistakable contralto tones of Joan Greenwood.\n\n&quot;Barbarella&quot; was a failure on its release, both at the box office and with the critics, yet despite the dodgy acting and the nonsensical plot it has since 1968 acquired the status of a cult movie. (Even back in my student days it was regarded as sort of historic artifact). Cults, whether religious or cinematic, can be baffling to everyone except ardent devotees, yet I must confess that I have a soft spot for this surreal relic of the hippie era. It is an ideal film to watch when returning from the pub late at night. Particularly if one is drunk. 6/10",

It isn&apos;t as well known as other films by Phil Karlson, such as THE PHENIX CITY STORY or WALKING TALL, but for my money it&apos;s better than either of them.  It predates PHENIX with that film&apos;s expose look, as KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL&apos;s climax is shot in a gritty, docudrama style.  Only the sappy resolution in the conclusion disappoints (which was likely studio-imposed, just to temper the hard-edge of the film; see also FOLLOW ME QUIETLY).  Nonetheless, it is a tightly-written noir with great mood and atmosphere.  Another plus is the generous showcases given to classic bad guys Lee Van Cleef, Neville Brand and Jack Elam, all so early in their careers."

He&apos;s three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.\n\nThe story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) He becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by THE child actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. Beware: this film is not for the squeamish.\n\nThis is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, but it&apos;s (the shaky camera) not for all tastes.\n\nBesides the two stars, there is the always-interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors.\n\nThe film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.",

      "reviewBody": "Lincoln (2012) \n\nA highly polished, restrained, important movie.\n\nThat doesn&apos;t make this an exciting movie. The acting is terrific, and filming excellent (including a color saturation pulled back to give it an old look without seeming affected). It is clearly expert in the way we expect from Steven Spielberg above perhaps anyone, at least in the mainstream conventional sense.\n\nBut there are two things that make this movie a must see. One is the content. It&apos;s about one of the two or three most important things ever to happen in this country--the fight to end slavery during the Civil War. This is such powerful stuff it will make you weep. (If it doesn&apos;t, you&apos;ll have to ask why.) It&apos;s laid out as clearly and emphatically as possible while still keeping accurate.\n\nThe second thing is simply the overwhelming performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is so good you forget it&apos;s a performance (unlike, for example, his intensity in &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; which stood out as a work of acting above the movie). Here he is so woven into the fabric of things he is indistinguishable from the historic truth, somehow. It&apos;s really the magic of the transparency of movie-making of this kind. Amazing performance.\n\nIt seems sacrilege to say this but the movie isn&apos;t perfect. Because of its material--getting the anti-slavery amendment through Congress--it involves a lot of talk, and a lot of people that you have to keep track of. I think Spielberg did this as good as it could be done, so no criticism there, but it does mean a lack of physical and even emotional drama through much of the film. I don&apos;t mean it&apos;s dull, just that it&apos;s conversational. I also found shreds of Spielberg&apos;s Frank Capra quality of making the movies--and his subjects--a little simplified. He ties up loose ends. He makes it all a fine package, very fine. Maybe too fine for what I would call high art. At times.\n\nI think we&apos;ll have an easier time judging it in six months, or six years. Also the subject matter makes it almost unassailable, since clearly most of us are all for the passing of any anti-slavery legislation.\n\nSee this for all the reasons you have heard. Don&apos;t miss it. Maybe down a coffee before you go, but see it no matter what. As I say, it&apos;s important. It reminds you of greatness, and that&apos;s not something to miss.\n\nUPDATE over one year later: I see that I accepted a lot of decisions by the writer and director as their prerogative, like focussing on one issue and narrowing to a short period of time. I had no bones with the scope of the movie. But in retrospect I see how the limitations of time and scope and background also create a sense of mis-information. That is, if you want a bigger picture of Lincoln, this movie is not quite right. Its aggrandizement is also not unavoidable, like the somewhat insipid (and yet moving) recital of the Gettysburg Address at the beginning by soldiers. Overall, though, I stick to my main thought--see it, and soak up what you can, without expecting perfection. Yes, see it for what it is, nothing less.",

As with many films aimed at younger audiences there are messages that the writers, in this case Henson himself, have tried to convey, such as `be careful what you wish for (as in the heat of the moment we are not always sure what is best for us) and also about not taking things for granted. These lessons not only relate to the major target audience of young children but also teenagers and adults alike. The film also has values and attitudes about growing up, the central character Sarah is in the awkward stage between child and womanhood, the stage of adolescence. She acts like a child in her self importance and possessiveness but she is perhaps starting to grow out of her young imagination. She does not want to, her room full of inanimate companions, dreams and fantasies, she feels are slipping away.\n\nLabyrinth is about Sarah keeping her imagination alive, her fantasies and dreams, and these help her figure out what she is doing wrong, it helps her realise how her attitude is wrong and causes her to be depressed. There is certainly intelligence to this film if analysed deeply. There is depth to the script, and clear attitudes and values that Jim Henson conveys. Henson is in a way telling not just kids, but also adults, that our subconscious, which includes our dreams and imaginative side (in terms of taking yourself to another place, more than imagination in creating something like a piece of music for instance.) can be as affective a guide to where and when your live is going wrong as your conscious. Sometimes we don&apos;t realise things we have said or done until we dream. How many times have you said something, that every teen must have to their parents, for instance `I wish you were dead&apos;, very cruel but it is said. I have in the past and realised the full implication in a bad dream, a dream is the most effective doorway to imagine something outside of it really happening. \n\nWhat is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were. She says for instance at the close that every now and again she needs Hoggle and company. The opening of the film sees Sarah reciting from a book to herself, she is addressing the Goblin king and the characters of this book and her room are the cast of a play inside her mind, they are special to her and meaningful, in a way we might have a favourite song that speaks to us in some way. At the start of the film when we are first in her room there is clever use of visual hints that you wouldn&apos;t pick up on until watching a film the second time. Look around her room and you see the characters everywhere, Hoggle, Ludo even a little replica of a maze. There is also a clipping of Sarah&apos;s mother, who we do not know whether she is still alive, but in any case is not around, but she is with a man who is the likeness of the Goblin King. The man in the photo probably a figure of blame for the loss (however large) of Sarah&apos;s mother. What is also interesting is Sarah being a young girl at the start of puberty has a certain fascination and perhaps crush on the Goblin King, perhaps a combination of the character from the book and the likeness of which she has created this character in her head. Certainly on a visual and script basis there are some clever touches when you consider this is a kids film. \n\nThe film itself is much like the Wizard of Oz in terms of story (intentional maybe as it could represent something that Sarah finds special and perhaps inspirational). What I really love about the film is, that before the days of CGI, inside the Goblin world, which accounts for 90% of the film, everything is 100% set work, there must be well over a hundred sets and they are all imaginative an create the enchanting atmosphere of the film, these sets combined with some fantastic matte paintings from ILM that give even more of a scale to the film.\n\nI do really like this film, the look, the cheesy feel good 80&apos;s music, the characters, it is all great. There is some good humour and of course the odd piece of very childish low brow humour but that is to be expected. It is movie magic no question. David Bowie is good as the Goblin King and all the puppeted characters are fantastically brought to life in there movements and voicing as you would expect from a Henson film. A very youthful Jennifer Connelly before the days when many a website was devoted to her ample bosom, has a charm to her, she has to hold the movie together and win the audience, especially after being very bratty and effectively wishing her baby brother into the clutches of Goblins. She does manage to win the audience though and enchant them with her green eyes and youthful innocence.\n\nThis film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans. I can still to this day sit down and enjoy the film because I remember what Jim Henson tries to teach us. `Keep the inner child alive inside you sometimes he/she actually knows best&apos;. Perhaps certain events in recent years may have panned out differently had this been heeded by more people, but that is all just hear say.\n\nOverall this is a classic fantasy film with much artistry and charm to appreciate, certainly Henson had a skill in all his fields in the industry. ****",

(It&apos;s very much a product of its Reagan time, right down to the casual homophobia.) Robin Williams, for once not twinkling too hard or overworking his virtuosity or adorableness, is an Everyman Russian who unexpectedly defects in Bloomingdale&apos;s and goes on to live the immigrant experience, suffering urban indignities and romantic angst along the way. His worklife is a little easier, his economic situation a little less treacherous, and the people he meets a little nicer than they would be in real life. For all that, in its celebration of the melting pot and its warm embrace of the American urban landscape, the movie moved me to tears.",

A young woman (Rosemary Wilcox) is haunted by pop-Freudian dreams of her recently murdered psychologist (and lover), so for some reason she goes to a resort where the psychologist liked to hang out and becomes involved with a gangster (Adolf Celli) and the strange female resort owner (Alida Valli). Soon more murders occur involving the other guests at the resort, and it&apos;s not too hard to guess who is responsible.\n\nThe ridiculous portrayal of psychoanalysis in this movie makes even Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;Marnie&quot; look realistic, but personally I find this kind of preposterous psychobabble, unbelievable plot twists, and bizarro dream sequences far more entertaining than most of your more realistic &quot;psychological thrillers&quot;. There&apos;s also some solid acting talent involved here, especially Alida Valli and Adolf Celli as the two most obvious viallians. Lead Rosemary Dexter was originally casts as &quot;Justine&quot; in the Jess Franco film of the same name, but she was replaced American daughter-of-a-name actress Romina Powers, which is unfortunate because she proves here to be an infinitely better actress than Powers--and she gets naked a lot too. And speaking of getting naked, a young Sybil Danning also has a supporting role as a murder victim, pretty much doing what she always does in movies. (As with Linnae Quigley, I find Danning&apos;s early work much more interesting in that it is not ENTIRELY an excuse to show off her impressive nude torso).\n\nThis isn&apos;t one of the best giallo. And if you either hate Freud, on one hand, or take him very seriously, on the other, you may not like it too much. Generally though, I would recommend it."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Little Children&apos; is one of those movies set in suburbia that explores men and women dealing with strained marriages, the politics of parenting, inertia, loneliness, fidelity/infidelity and dangers lurking beneath the surface. When not done well, films like this can appear to be overblown soap operas. When done right, like this one is, it is something to sink your teeth into and enjoy.\n\nSarah (Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson) are both one-child, stay-at-home parents with a lack of focus or drive in their lives and a lack of connection with their spouses. Sarah is more frustrated - unwilling to just have a healthy fantasy life like the the other park mothers, while Brad drifts around and broods. They use their children as an excuse to spends more and more time with each other. Both actors give very bold performances here, their characters&apos; emotions radiate off their bodies even when they&apos;re not saying much. Winslet is particularly good, managing to give Sarah an earthy sensuality. Her character feels so trapped that her lust for a purposeful and happy life becomes a rebellion. Winslet makes Sarah so in touch with her emotional needs and gives her such a charged urgency that I found her alluring, something I haven&apos;t felt towards her in her past performances, through she&apos;s always been an attractive and extremely good actress.\n\nIn the other story, a recently-released child sex offender (he exposed himself to some kids) named Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) tries to exist in a community that is being taught to fear him. Haley really shines in his role as a man acutely aware that his dark urges are wrong but is still in their grip. Haley is far more deserving of the supporting actor Oscar than Alan Arkin was, for his by-the-numbers &apos;Little Miss Sunshine&apos; performance, but I guess they wanted to give him some sort of lifetime achievement recognition.\n\nThe movie slowly, piece by piece, becomes more gripping as everyones&apos; lives become more desperate and tangled. This is sort of like &apos;Desperate Housewives&apos; except more mature and less quippy. The script and direction manage to maintain focus on what is important. A criticism I have heard of this movie is that Brad and Sarah&apos;s spouses (Jennifer Connelly and Greg Edelman) are not developed enough and only serve to justify the two leads. Even though this may be true (Sarah&apos;s husband is pretty much a cameo) I have mixed feelings on this. The filmmakers&apos; clear intention was only to feature the spouses in a way that gives you an idea of the relationship they have with the main characters, and to further flesh out the main characters. In other words, less is more. While this may or may not have been fine, it is only the ending of the film where it becomes a relevant problem. The film ends for Sarah and Brad in a way that calls into question the exact state of their current marriages. Since the spouses are underwritten, the viewer is left with a bit of an empty feeling. We&apos;ve come to know the characters very well, but the information isn&apos;t quite aligned with the questions the ending raises. Also the film shows its literary roots through its heavy reliance on a narrator at the start, which (don&apos;t worry) becomes rarer as the film progresses. Much of what the narrator says is unnecessary as the actors are often already doing such a great job acting out the narrated text.\n\nHowever, all this aside, &apos;Little Children&apos; is clearly engaging, entertaining, carefully made and doesn&apos;t struggle to find things to say. I highly recommend it, if, like me, you&apos;re of those people who are constantly looking for something meaty in terms of acting, story and dramatic conflict.",

      "reviewBody": "Thank heavens for Tim Burton. He knows how to make movies. Many people do. But how many do it by having an original notion, a specific, genuinely original tone and then project that into the machinery we have to make movies. Someone like him needs to fight at every step, something that someone like Spielberg just flows with.\n\nSo he needs to be supported, rather like Woody Allen, no matter what.\n\nBut sometimes he will surprise. For me, those surprises come in small bits, usually parts of movies. \n\nThis little thing is so perfectly conceived though. Other than &quot;PeeWee,&quot; and &quot;Corpse&quot; this is the only project where the scope of the thing is larger than the timespan.\n\nPlus it has a simple self-referential caste: Vincent the boy who wishes to be Vincent Price, in a story narrated by Vincent himself. A movie about a life about movies, A movie by Burton about the young Burton. An antiSeuss, using the Seuss cadence.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Black Dragons&quot; is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It&apos;s not as bad as some would have you believe.\n\n A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him. The reasons behind Colomb&apos;s actions are not explained until the final reel. Until all is explained at the end, the story is hard to comprehend. \n\n Lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies, is actually quite good in this one. He is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director William Nigh. Lugosi&apos;s character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his Dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes.\n\n Clayton Moore, a one dimensional actor at best, would become TV&apos;s Lone Ranger in a few years. Joan Barclay makes a good heroine.\n\n Although a little dated now, &quot;Black Dragons&quot; is not a bad way to spend an hour.",

However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end. The acting is fairly good, as is the location and the story starts out rather well too. The problem, not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner. Unfortunately after that the movie showed the monster very little and the back of the DVD lied as it told me that the desert beneath the people literally came alive and was capable of devouring their flesh...now that would have been some movie, a nearly inescapable situation. Granted that would have made viewers uncomfortable and it might of ramped up the tension, but that is what horror movies are supposed to do! Instead we have very few shots of the creature or creatures as it were and when we do see it, it is mainly on the defensive. Still it wasn&apos;t all bad, it just needed more horror less hunting and more chomping.",

So I would never say that about a well-respected film like &quot;Jules and Jim.&quot; But quite honestly, I can&apos;t warm up to it. I&apos;ve watched it on more than one occasion over the years, and it never fails to put me to sleep at both ends of my anatomy. I&apos;ve just viewed a DVD edition in which a film scholar clearly explains his views on the fascination of &quot;Jules and Jim.&quot; But I still couldn&apos;t see why the relationship of these three tedious characters, discussed and analyzed in all its very tedious minutiae by those same characters and an off-screen narrator (also tedious), should interest me. It&apos;s certainly beloved by academic types (maybe for those very same characteristics?), and film critics eat it up like it has gravy on it. Like another commentator, I&apos;m a bit puzzled by all the comments about its lyrical, lighthearted and idyllic qualities. I&apos;m left with the impression of a rather dry, academic dissertation on the complexities of male-female relationships ca. 1961 (the 1910 setting seems to me immaterial to the script).\n\nI can&apos;t help feeling that I&apos;m missing something, and I&apos;m not averse to French films, but they&apos;re usually older, pre-new-wave films, for example &quot;Forbidden Games,&quot; &quot;French Can-Can,&quot; or Pagnol&apos;s &quot;Fanny&quot; trilogy. I take it that the sentimentality of such films is one of the things new wave directors reacted against. If so, I can&apos;t jump on their bandwagon, try as I might. I&apos;ve enjoyed some of Truffaut&apos;s work, but not this, I&apos;m afraid.\n\nTo those who love and appreciate &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; -- have pleasure of it. I envy you for that, and maybe I&apos;ll try it again in a few years."

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs. Revisited it recently. This is the tenth in the Bond series n the third to star Roger Moore as the secret agent James Bond. This is also one of my fav Bond film n it is very entertaining.\n\nThis time Bond has to deal with a reclusive but ultra rich scientist Stromberg, who plans to create WW3 and later aft the nuclear war, build a new civilisation under the sea. Lol. He shud have consulted Aquaman first. To thwart Stomberg&apos;s plan, Bond teams up with a Russian agent known as triple X.\n\nThis movie has one of my personal fav scene, the Union Jack-parachute scene.\n\nThis time Bond gets to cool off with Sue Vanner n Barbara Bach. And we get to cool off our eyes with Caroline Munro&apos;s amazing cleavage.\n\nApart from Stromberg, Bond has to face a motorbike henchman with a rocket sidecar, a small army of soldiers in red, an atractive helicopter pilot (Munro) n Stromberg&apos;s two fierce henchmen, Jaws n Sandor.\n\nSome info on Stromberg from the book- he is totally bald, lacking eyebrows, and has a small mouth. Only the pinkie and ring finger of his left hand are webbed, as opposed to all of his digits in the film. His character is also given a rather lengthy backstory, revealing how he made his fortune and got into the shipping industry.\n\nSome info on Jaws from the book - he used to b a basketball player but due to his sluggish reaction and his lack of speed, his career ended. Later he was arrested by the secret police for having taken part in a riot n beaten by the cops with hollow steel clubs encased in thick leather, breaking his jaw beyond repair. It was Stromberg who hired a prestigious doctor to create an artificial jaw for Jaws, that created the two rows of terrifying razor-sharp teeth.",

      "reviewBody": "I was prepared for almost anything going into this movie, knowing that so many filmmakers who adapt classic stories think it is their duty to &quot;update&quot; the story, or feel the need to add a lot of comic relief.\n\nThankfully, Winick did not succumb to these temptations. Instead, he offers a delightfully filmed version of the story, with CG effects so realistic and subtle that they detract from the live action base not even a little bit.\n\nThis movie is very true to the original story, and the comic relief was, in my opinion, not at all overbearing. I got a lot of genuine laughs out of the movie, and, at 40, that&apos;s saying something for a G-rated movie aimed at families with small children.\n\nThe movie has an old-fashioned but familiar feel to it. It seems to represent the America we all think we remember, and want to see when we visit the country. It seems in many ways timeless, without feeling Disney-esquire. I&apos;m sure this is what the filmmakers were going for, and they hit it right on the nose.\n\nI thought the casting was excellent, for the most part. Though Agnes Moorehead (from the original animated version) absolutely bowls Oprah Winfrey over as the goose, and Julia Roberts&apos; voice was maybe a bit too matter-of-fact for Charlotte. Debbie Reynolds&apos; extra-sweet voice did, I think, a just-so-slightly better job in the original. That aside, Miss Fanning is perfect as Fern, and Siobhan Fallon could not play the incredulous Mrs. Zuckerman one iota better.\n\nI think E.B. White would be pleased. This is as honest a representation of his wonderful story as anyone could hope for.\n\nIf you have small kids, read them the book, and then go see the movie.\n\nIf you read the book as a kid, and still smile when you think about it, then go see it yourself.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "the one end of the spectrum is Josef Von Sternberg &apos;morocco&apos;, his genius evocation of the desert in the aseptic atmosphere of the paramount studios of 1930, an artificial space, the completely cimematogaphic picture of eroticism, sexuality or yearning, the illusion of the dream factory, shortly cinema and nothing else.\n\non the other end of this spectrum stands Werner Herzog and his film &apos;fata Morgana&apos;(1970): he shot on location, as he always does, but the place he creates, his view, his idea of the location is as unreal as Von Sternberg&apos;s, just in opposite approach: in his mind the Sahara is seen through the eyes of an alien, so it becomes to an enigmatic and pessimistic state deception, a super elevation of the preset; (some kind of a reverse angle of this film is his &apos;the wild blue yonder&apos;) however, Von Sternberg or Herzog, the intention is the same: the creation of the cinematographic room.\n\nnow Raymond Depardon, in his beginnings famous photo reporter, making movies over thirty years, always on the edge of documentary and fiction, with an especially passion for the continent Africa; alongside his other great works, is it this passionate relationship, which will be of interest for us now.\n\nalthough or because of he shoots (like Herzog) always on location, in this film there are grades of alienation, let&apos;s say fractures or reflections, because the word alienation in this case seems too much Brecht: the pictures reflects the commentary, the commentary reflects the novel, the novel (maybe) the true events; it&apos;s the thing with the Russian puppets. the novel by Diego Brosset from a hundred year ago, the pictures by Depardon also a reconstruction, a convergence at the same place at another time. at large cinema often has to do with different action in the same time at different places (horizontal heterogeneity), or different action at the same place in different times (vertical heterogeneity).\n\na vertical heterogeneity in a similar conception as depardon&apos;s you can discover in &apos;operai, contadini&apos;(2000), a genius masterpiece by jean Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet.\n\nin both cases of course this special kind of vertical heterogeneity is far beyond the closed system of (filmic) dramaturgy, because it is based on the real places and the real events so it works in a much wider signification: it is realism, far away from any naturalistic attitude at all: a discrepancy to the highly artificial conception of Von Sternberg or to the dreamed extraterrestrial view of Herzog? yes and no. in all these examples it is the radical personal view of the filmmakers which creates the cinematographic space; comparable only within the family of the great masters and magicians of seventh art, but always unique. \n\ndifferent from the Straubs Depardon shot his film in black and white and this was his most radical decision. the first shot of the movie is the most abstract of all: the completely white screen. but it is a very concrete picture also, soon you can see black spots in the white, which become &apos;figures in a landscape&apos;. the abstract in the concrete, out from the concrete, illusion and disillusionment, other inseparable pairs and antipodes in cinematography. the landscape here, the desert, is a waste land a &apos;empty quarter&apos; if you want, and the way depardon shows us this void, is deeply shaking: a flamboyant nothing in which the human either is like a foreign substance in a hostile space (again Werner Herzog and his &apos;extraterrestrial&apos; point of view in &apos;Fata Morgana&apos;), this seems to apply mainly for the strangers, the colonialists, the occupying force, the natives attends rather as a kind of symbiotic mergence, which consequently results in vanishing. vanishing of people, vanishing of picture: the sandstorm, which in depardon&apos;s photography resembles a snowstorm, nearly solves the picture to the abstract white screen again.\n\nthe lost of surrounding is the lost of security; to slide, to fall: the storm blows sand over the dunes like in the apocalyptic last shot of (again) herzogs &apos;Nosferatu - Phantom Der Nacht&apos;, the humans are sliding down the shifting dunes without foothold, like in Jacques Rivette&apos;s &apos;merry-go-round&apos;, so the barely visible landscape is in constantly sliding too. no safeness at all. no safeness for the colonial troops in their forts, the invaders and oppressors; in terms of filmic semiotic this is the genre of western: they are the soldiers in their forts, the Tuareg are the Indians. left the fort means death: the natives struggle with nature is the principal theme of Flaherty: &apos;man of Aran&apos;, &apos;nanook of the north&apos;..\n\nthe most shocking moment in Depardon&apos;s film is the change from day to night, in the middle; so far during the whole picture you solely have seen a crude brightness, which i at least have never seen before in cinema, and now there is the blackest black.\n\nthe brutal and abrupt change of day and night, let us physically feel the change of heat and cold. here we see the probably most genius shot of the whole film, again concrete although it looks like abstract &apos;cinéma absolute&apos;, like a shot made by Méliès or from an animation film: the completely black screen. through this blacking wanders a perfect white disc, which is in the concrete action the moon, which could be an abstract geometric field by Oskar Fischinger or Norman McLaren for example. of course it this the moon, but this ambiguity (illusion and disillusionment) is the key to the entire concept.\n\nthe human being is foaled Heidegger would say.",

      "reviewBody": "Aesthetically speaking, this is a pretty average Jimmy Cagney film. It stars Cagney as the pretty typical fast-talking but likable schemer and Bette Davis in a rather forgettable role she probably detested. Miss Davis reportedly liked Cagney but longed for roles where she was more than just &quot;the girlfriend&quot;. In this film she is slightly more, as she&apos;s bright and pretty assertive, but once again it was the type of role that would neither hurt nor help her career to get to the next level. She was quite good in the film, but indications of her future greatness just aren&apos;t all that obvious.\n\nHowever, despite the film&apos;s averageness and Miss Davis&apos; limited character and the film only earning a 6, I actually enjoyed the film quite a bit. It&apos;s exactly the type of formulaic Warner Brothers film I enjoy and I try to see every Cagney, Pat O&apos;Brien or Edward G. Robinson film of this era I can find because they are just a lot of fun to watch. Yes, they are rather predictable, but somehow Warner still made the characters likable and compelling. In this case, Cagney plays his typical guy skirting the edges of larceny in the form of a guy running a company that seeks out lost relatives to inherit fortunes. I also thought that juxtaposing this unsophisticated lout of a character with the classy charmer who is wooing Bette was an excellent move--particularly in how this played out in the end.\n\nA typical Cangey film with some very unusual plot elements and twists, this movie is just plain fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Terms like &quot;bizarre&quot;, &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;convoluted&quot; are often used too lightly in reviews for Italian gialli, but in case of &quot;Death Laid an Egg&quot; they are severe understatements! I&apos;m not even sure this one qualifies as a giallo, because although the film got released before the genre properly started booming (in 1968), it&apos;s already experimenting with different plots and thinking out-of-the-box in terms of style and plot twists. Generally speaking, a giallo either handles about a masked psycho-killer with black gloves savagely butchering people - preferably pretty young models - with sharp objects, or it handles about a convoluted murder conspiracy complete with sexual intrigues, betrayal and triangular relationships. &quot;Death Laid an Egg&quot; primarily fits into the second category, but also somewhat in the first one, and then still even a lot more! The most intriguing aspect about the triangular relationship (between a man, his wife and her secretary) is that it takes place at the woman&apos;s family business; - a chicken far where insanely unethical experiments take place (headless/boneless poultry monstrosities will haunt your nightmares!). Furthermore, the man has a fetish for slicing up prostitutes, and the mistress may or may not have a secret agenda with a hunky marketing agent. One thing&apos;s for sure, though, all the loose ends form a compelling wholesome that keeps you gazing at the screen and - unlike many other similar films - everything nicely comes together in the end, and &quot;Death Laid an Egg&quot; does deliver in every department (mystery, suspense, flamboyance, ...)\n\nWriter/director Giulio Questi was a very strange individual, to say the least. He seemingly doesn&apos;t care about traditional cinematic patterns or logical narrative structure, and many sequences/plot twists appear to be improvised on the spot. The opening credits, the soundtrack, and many camera perspectives are utterly weird! Questi also made the western-outcast &quot;Se sei vivo spara&quot;, which is possibly the strangest Spaghetti Western ever, and the reputedly bonkers psychological horror/thriller &quot;Arcana&quot; (which I haven&apos;t seen yet).",

      "reviewBody": "I attended the preview screening of &quot;Tuvalu&quot; for one simple reason - it was the first film of the day and fit into my schedule.   Having read a brief synopsis of the film, I went in with mixed expectations -  the review snippets lauded the film, but could a two-hour black and white film largely bereft of dialogue really be that entertaining?  Please pass the crow...\n\n Set in a dilapidated indoor swimming pool (the Central Baths in Sofia), the film details the efforts of Anton, a clueless dreamer who yearns to sail the world, and Martha, the button obsessed cashier, to maintain the illusion for Anton&apos;s blind father that business is thriving.  Working to sabotage their efforts is Gregor - Anton&apos;s brother - an amoral developer who is determined to raze the entire town and construct a sprawling condominium complex. Gregor engineers an accident that seems certain to doom the business and in the process steals away Eva, the beautiful woman of Anton&apos;s dreams.  Will Gregor&apos;s dastardly plan succeed? It is difficult to categorize this film as it refuses to fit neatly within the confines of any particular genre. Taken on its simplest merits it is a slapstick comedy in the tradition of the Marx Brothers, Chaplin and the Keystone Cops. On this level, alone it will satisfy most viewers.  A closer examination reveals a beautiful fairly tale with an innocent dreamer fighting to save his world and loved ones from evil.   Finally, there is the none- too -subtle rail against the freight train of modernization, particularly relevant in many areas of post-Communist where vast construction projects are radically altering the cityscapes at the expense of history.  However, one need look no further that our own city to see this -only recently have serious efforts been made to safeguard heritage buildings in Vancouver - some fear it may already be too late.  \n\n Originally filmed in black and white, the stock was laboriously tinted to give the interior shots take a Sepia tone and the exterior shots a muddy turquoise- grey, providing further contrast for the story elements. The visual experience is further enhanced by masterful cinematography, most notably the underwater sequences, which take on a wondrous ethereal quality. The sound engineers have also created a richly diverse auditory realm that meshes uncannily with the onscreen action.  Finally, the exaggerated expressiveness of the actors, both emotive and physical keep the action flowing seamlessly. \n\nIf you are in search of an unusual, intriguing film, look no further.",

The script was garbage. Literally half the script was birds sticking their tounges out at each other and saying &quot;It&apos;s a swift thing.&quot; The scenery animation was good, but the bird animation was early 2000&apos;s work. The first fifteen minutes of the movie has a plot, and then the rest of it barely resembles any plot at all. Don&apos;t waste your money or your children&apos;s brain cells with this.",

      "reviewBody": "Danish director Ole Christian Madsen must have felt the need for a change of pace and setting from his usual style. While his other films are tight, well-composed dramas, SuperClásico benefits from a loose, more free flowing construction and as the film plays out you realize that style and mood are a perfect match.\n\nThis film is in no way groundbreaking, nor is it meant to be. The title is a comment on the film itself, and the characters are all acting as they&apos;re supposed to be in a dramedy of this kind.\n\nHowever, you can&apos;t help but to be engaged in the story, mainly because of some great performances and the beautiful Argentinian settings. All the supporting actors work well, without ever being more than 2-dimensional, as the character development is reserved for the main players. Especially Anders W. Berthelsen does a great job at conveying a man who&apos;s nearly given up on life until he is introduced to a change of scenery.\n\nSuperClásico is recommended if you&apos;re looking for a sweet film with just the right amount of sentimentalism and temperament. It will in no way rock your world, but it&apos;s damn charming with very few weak moments. It recalls the feeling from Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Lost in Translation a little bit.",

At times it appears to be a normal picture until the surreal aspects make themselves known with subtlety. The editing is seamless, almost but not quite confusing, and the callbacks to earlier scenes are never overused.\n\nIt is not a spoiler to state that early on Something Isn&apos;t Quite Right, and there are story elements that the avid moviegoer will know to be central to the conclusion. However, it&apos;s the path that leads to the end that makes the time enjoyable.\n\nNaomi Watts, as usual, is perfect, and Ewan McGregor has again picked one of the scripts that was for the art and not the money. Ryan Gosling is effective, and Jeanine Garafolo&apos;s three minutes were eerie. I&apos;m certain that Elizabeth Reaser will be seen again.\n\nNot a perfect movie, but definitely worth the time if you enjoy surrealistic stories.\n\n8/10",

Steve Coogan particularly doesn&apos;t seem to fit in a comedic role. The cameo roles were ok but nothing amazing. I found Arnold&apos;s cameo as a Turkish Monarch rather drab and I thought they should have done some more. Jackie Chan as usual out did himself with some of his stunts. Making some ordinary items into weapons are just great.\n\n SOme of the effects were OK especially the shots showing the different cities they went to. A little to much &quot;computery&quot; but none the less good enough.\n\nThe ending I thought was a serious disappointment. Instead of ending on a high it went down with a big THUD!",

Luke Perry, where did he come from? he looks so out of it, with long redundant shots on him while he is &quot;contemplating&quot; with no purpose, OMG. Bruce Davison, why humiliate yourself at your age? well, i guess the money wasn&apos;t bad.

      "reviewBody": "DUNE is an odd film.  After having watched it several times over the years, I&apos;m not afraid to call it a very flawed classic.  That sounds strange, but it fits for this movie.  Lynch got so many things right, but in the end the shortcomings of trying to squeeze an epic story into a little over 2 hours was simply too daunting a challenge.  Besides, I&apos;m sure many went into the theatre expecting a film in the vein of STAR WARS.  \n\nDUNE is not a story with which one can delve into brainless.  It does require thought, for it&apos;s inaccurate to portray it as anything less than a thinking person&apos;s story.  It&apos;s not space battles, laser-gun shootouts, funny aliens, etc. There&apos;s nothing wrong with those things, it&apos;s just not what DUNE is about.  It touches on everything from politics, religion, ecology, the true power of the human mind and will when fully realized, God, etc. Some heady stuff.  \n\nSo imagine trying to fit all that in a movie.  \n\nLynch got the feel, the imagery down, but wasn&apos;t able to cohesively bring the story around w/o really making it a Cliff Notes version of the story. You get the main gist, but don&apos;t get the &quot;full story&quot;, the themes, etc.  So in the end it does disappoint because you&apos;re left  wondering what may have been had the movie conventions of that time  allowed for a 2 or even 3 movie epic.  Oh wait, STAR WARS did that.  I guess DUNE wasn&apos;t viewed as bankable enough to make such an investment.\n\nAnyway, I still like the film a lot.  The visual realization by Lynch makes it a classic in my book, too bad it couldn&apos;t be matched by an equally strong script. I wonder if Peter Jackson would be willing to tackle another 3 film epic? Hmmmmmm....."

It is fun, tense, never boring despite those so simple and basic plots. Here, in this film, Gough is the villain but for whom you can feel some empathy because of his desperate fights to save his zoo and animals against greedy and nasty estate brokers, business men or other ambitious land owners seeking to get rid of him. Plus, you have good characterization. I like those early sixties films. The opening scene is, I guess, a tribute to Val Lewton - Jacques Tourneur&apos;s CAT PEOPLE and LEOPARD MEN."

Womanizer Rahul (Salman Khan) sees her and is determined to seduce her, but she is not taken in by his lies. \n\nThis romantic drama showcases Matondkar&apos;s excellent dancing with some impressive musical numbers. Shammi Kapoor is great in his role as Grandfather. While this is a familiar role for Khan, he does it well enough that I intensely disliked him at times. The plot was good, predictable in it&apos;s happy ending, but still enjoyable. Overall, it&apos;s an entertaining film for Bollywood fans.",

The paradox of the enchantment of Nazism has been too little problematized in the cinema, and any attempt to say anything new on the subject is welcome. Schlöndorff does a cinematically good work, but where the film falters is in the way actual, brutal history and Abel&apos;s vision of Nazism as the Magic Kingdom are bound together. It&apos;s hard to pinpoint where the fault lies; there&apos;s just a sense of maybe trying too much at once. Anyway, an honorable and perhaps too multi-layered analysis of the 20th century nightmare.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite some of the marketing, Chris Crow&apos;s zeitgeisty paranoia thriller owes as much if not more to Hitchcock&apos;s Lifeboat as it does to modern &quot;torture porn&quot;, such as the Saw sequels. This is a slow-burning, character-based ensemble piece, tightly written and unfussily directed, which takes our web-based fears and makes them monstrously manifest; not only our anxiety about identity theft, but also touching upon our perceived anonymity, leading as it does to a sense of invulnerability - and from behind that veil, the screenwriters suggest, we are free to act upon our cruellest base desires with virtual immunity.\n\nInevitably, perhaps, the tension gives way to more visceral final act, but Crow&apos;s camera never lingers or leers. The 18 certificate (in the UK) seems harsh, given the recent, similarly-budgeted excesses of Tom Six and Srðan Spasojeviæ, from which this is a mercifully far cry.\n\nOne may well be left with the feeling that this is a desperately topical film, cashing in on the current trends for horror games and social networking - and this is not an unreasonable response. But there is real quality here, not least in the four central performances, superbly depicting the rapid mental decline as the dire situation dawns: that they&apos;ve been given the trip of a lifetime, and it looks like it&apos;ll be the last of their lives. This descent could have been unconvincing, but as the laughter fades and the camera becomes unfixed, the effect is quite involving.\n\nIt&apos;s a pity that this kind of ingenious lo-fi horror is so often lost in the shadow of dismal Hollywood remakes. We can help right this wrong by supporting freshness and ingenuity where we see it.",

That said (and my bias revealed), I have to admit that I don&apos;t care much for this film- though I do admit it has some strengths- namely the visual elements, which reflect the director&apos;s background as a painter (he knows how to frame and arrange a shot, and he picks beautiful lines and colors to illustrate his story). Tilda Swenton&apos;s performance is amazing (has she ever been bad?) and provides the emotional thrust of the movie- we believe she wants Edward so badly that she&apos;s willing to kill him so no one else will have him. Unfortuneately, Gaveston just comes off as a twisted psychotic and Waddington&apos;s performance as Edward renders the king weaker than Marlowe writes him, and yet devoid of the inner vulnerability that ultimately makes the King sympathetic- I never once believe they really love each other, let alone madly enough to topple a whole nation. But plot and character don&apos;t seem to be a priority of the film as much as statements about gay rights and strange, arty and really heavy-handed intrusions. Too bad, really. There&apos;s so much to be dug out of the script- and some of those gems DO appear in this film... but so many seem not only undiscovered, but lost in a lot of camp, confusion, violence and raw, un-erotic sex. Don&apos;t get me wrong- the film is worth seeing... I just hope that one day, I get to make a new interpretation.",

      "reviewBody": "OK, let me say right off the bat I am a little biased. This film was shot here in Alabama, and most of it was filmed right here in my home county of Butler. One of my high school classmate&apos;s son is featured throughout the movie as &quot;Lonnie&quot; and other folks I know served as extras or performed as part of the choir.\n\nAnd I loved seeing the people and places I know up on the big screen. I think Maggie and John are &quot;da bomb.&quot; The woman is a hugger; I love that warmth. John&apos;s the most down-to-earth guy.\n\nThat being said, I can also honestly report to you &quot;Honeydripper&quot; is a good movie - not perfect, but very much worth seeing. I think Danny Glover is sensational in the lead role as Pine Top and he and Charles Dutton are totally believable as two old pals fighting the odds to save Pine Top&apos;s blues club. Keb&apos; Mo&apos; is delightful as the &quot;Greek Chorus&quot; known as Possum, a mysterious and witty blind guitarist.\n\nIf you love blues music and early rock &apos;n&apos; roll; if you enjoy a story that takes its time, one filled with complex characters and some memorable lines penned by Sayles - a movie made with love and lots of heart - then &quot;Honeydripper&quot; just might be for you.",

      "reviewBody": "Unjustly put into the back-seat of Federico Fellini&apos;s extraordinary career, I Vitelloni is a relatively simplistic tale of 30-something slackers in a small 1950&apos;s Italian town. While it doesn&apos;t stand out against works such as La Dolce Vita (1960) or 8 1/2 (1963), this shows a different side to Fellini&apos;s famous circus-tent approach, engaging Neo- Realist sensibilities to form a rather bleak, but nonetheless amusing autobiographical film. While Amarcord (1973) was a more straight-forward depiction of Fellini&apos;s childhood memories, I Vitelloni seems to be based on people he has observed, possibly while growing up, who, like him, sought to break out of small-town life. Amarcord was a sweet homage to his hometown, but I Vitelloni shows what this kind of life can do to a generation born to parents of sacrifice.\n\nThe Vitelloni (translated as &apos;the Boys&apos;) consist of Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), a quiet, observant young man; Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), a handsome playboy; Alberto (Alberto Sordi), a daydreamer unhappy at his sister&apos;s affair with a married man; and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste), the writer who harbours dreams of writing critically-adored plays. After Fausto gets Moraldo&apos;s sister Sandra (Leonora Ruffo) pregnant, he thinks about skipping town, but is talked out of it. He instead married Sandra, but continues to pursue women, whether they&apos;re single or taken, or even if they&apos;re married to his boss. With carnival approaching, we witness the group try their best to do as little as possible. They all dream of escaping the town, but do nothing to help it. Instead, they drink, gamble and chase women.\n\nFellini doesn&apos;t have disdain for these characters, but shows them for what they are. They see their parents and grandparents, old and seemingly miserable, and see what their sacrifice has brought them. So, naturally, they rebel. Fausto is undoubtedly a loathsome character, even going as far as leaving a cinema half-way through a movie, where he is with his wife, to chase a beautiful woman. But for all his flaws, he still manages to gather sympathy. It seems like he simply cannot stop, locked into a life in which he doesn&apos;t belong, but he is solely responsible for. Yet for all his complexities, you can&apos;t help but feel relieved when he is given his comeuppance by his father. It&apos;s a clever juxtaposition of the generations, and although society will always produce a &apos;generation X&apos;, sometimes a good slap in the face is what is needed.\n\nAlthough Fellini remains somewhat reserved throughout the majority of the film, choosing a still, controlled camera, he breaks out of the neo- Realism approach about half-way through for a scene in which carnival comes to town, with the sound of a lonesome drunken trumpet player running in a circle bellowing in an abandoned dance hall, as the catatonic Alberto staggers outside. It&apos;s the style that he would explode with in later years, as giant paper-mache heads poke out amongst sweaty party-goers. It helps counteract the seriousness of the movie&apos;s themes, perhaps even subtly elevating it, but it&apos;s the film&apos;s touching final sentiment that will stay with you, as a train carries one of the Vitelloni out of the town. Whether he will be back, or whether it will finally allow him to be happy we don&apos;t know, and that&apos;s a tragic statement if there ever was one.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

Comparing Omar Epps to Tom Hanks is so inappropriate in this film. There is never meant to be a love connection between Epps and Ryan. It&apos;s more of a mothering relationship; the son she never had and the mothering he never received. You are either going to love or hate this movie.

      "reviewBody": "A Parting Shot (Pas Douce, &quot;not tender&quot;, in French) is a strange little film: not fully convincing, but not boring either. Constantly juggling profound psychological analysis and contrived simplicity, it ultimately leaves the viewer with nothing new, its short running time, steady pace and gritty performances ensuring, however, that it flows quickly without exasperating.\n\nThe original title refers to the female lead, Frédérique (Isild Le Besco), a lonely, mentally unstable nurse who lives in a small Swiss town. To be more specific, &quot;not tender&quot; is how some bloke describes her when she engages in casual sex with him and another guy. Why she does that is never explained. The same goes for the following scene, where she hides in a wood and decides to kill herself with a shotgun. Weirdly enough, the bullet winds up injuring a young boy named Marco (Steven de Almeida), and just to make things more ironic, she is among the nurses who are asked to take care of him.\n\nThe premise is admittedly fresh and intriguing, offering plenty of ideas for a solid drama. Alas, for some reason director Jeanne Waltz opts for opening a couple of subplots without exploring them any further, depriving the film of meaning and resonance. What, for example, is the point of introducing Marco&apos;s parents and their supposedly troubled marriage and then ignore the whole situation for the rest of the movie? Similarly, some room is offered to Frédérique&apos;s boyfriend, but with no explanation of her unhappiness and his possible role in it those scenes come off as hollow and pointless.\n\nAnother flaw is the shooting scene that triggers the entire movie (pun intended): reading the plot synopsis, I expected a certain sequence; what I saw was so different and ridiculous (I will not reveal any details, see for yourself) it almost ruined the mood of the feature. Fortunately, the few bits where perpetrator and victim interact are enough to keep the film on track, Le Besco&apos;s ambiguous stare and de Almeida&apos;s contained rage completing each other in a bond that effectively saves A Parting Shot from being the usual simple-minded, arty piece of work that tries to reach the heart without even knowing where it is.\n\n6,5/10",

The King has recently married Queen Marie of Normandy (Joan Sims) but since she eats too much garlic, thus putting the King off his conjugal rights, he plots to get her out the way. However, he must tread carefully as a war with France could easily arise should anything happen to the Queen.\n\nSome of the best colour Carry On movies would turn out to be set in an historical period. Carry On Henry is not one of the best from the historical romps, but it&apos;s a goodie and for those who like the saucy side of the series then it has plenty of appeal.\n\nThe presence of James on womanising and boozing form, and Barbara Windsor doing her no brain all sexuality act, gives this entry its saucy soul, while Terry Scott (superb visual ticks), Kenny Williams (a continuously wonderful foil for Scott) and Charles Hawtrey mince about with gleeful abandon. The energy of the comedy is high and sustained throughout, while the art design and costuming is regal in production. The gunpowder plot forms a side-bar narrative, which is joyous but also shows us that Kenneth Connor is sadly under used, but the innuendo and purposely groan inducing gags are always on hand to tickle the senses of those so inclined towards this splinter of the popular British institution. 7/10",

The new girlfriend gets murdered with the boyfriend as chief suspect and surprise, surprise the psychopath being everyones Miss Innocent, well apart from one lady detective. The murder victim becomes an angel and Johnathan Frakes is her guide who helps her to prove to the world what really happened. Mr Frakes seems to have the same wardrobe as in that paranormal/weird happenings show he does. Throughout the film I felt he had ulterior motives, I was wondering is he a good angel or a baddie.\n\nThe film itself has that made for TV feel about it, however its very well acted by all.  Special mention must be for the three main females who play each of their parts well. The script throughout is never too slushy or biblical.  A sort of mixture between Ghost and an episode of Highway to Heaven. All in all a very good film for its genre and worth watching.  Nice little twist at the end, which I was not expecting."

They fight a whole lot about everything, cards, liquor, women. There kind of a western version of James Cagney and Pat O&apos;Brien.\n\nWhen Wayne decides he&apos;s not going to get stiffed out of rodeo prize money he won, they take matters into their own hands, taking precisely what&apos;s owed Wayne. Of course when two real robbers, Al Ferguson and Paul Fix decide to clean out the rest of the rodeo cash and kill the promoter, our heroes get blamed for it and have to spend nearly the rest of the film on the run.\n\nOf course this is a Lone Star cheapie that the Duke stars in here with production values severely limited. This one however had the potential to be something better. At a better studio with a tighter script and their production values, this could have been a Duke classic.\n\nAs it is it&apos;s one of his better B pictures from Monogram.",

We watched Moskva-Kassiopeya many times for its strong context, great adventure and clever dialogues. It has right mix of comedy and suspense, good characters and very strong plot.\n\nThis adventure tells a story of a group of young astronauts freeing civilization of one of the planets in constellation Kassiopeya from the empire of artificial intelligence - robots.\n\nI may never see this movie again in my life. It&apos;s a pity that it is probably considered as an obsolete piece of the soviet propaganda. I never felt this from this movie and who has seen some masterpieces from soviet cinematography knows that all of them  criticize regime in a very effective way.\n\nMoskva-Kassiopeya is a great movie for all ages."

      "reviewBody": "When the Japanese invaded the area of the Western Pacific in 1941-42, their occupation was a harsh one. The people native to the areas were brutally treated and often killed for minor transgressions. Due to the wide area occupied by the Japanese and the difficulty of mounting large scale amphibious operations, the Allied forces formed a set of small commando teams that would engage in quick strikes against high value targets. This overall unit was called Z Special Unit and was primarily made up from Australian and New Zealand volunteers. During the war, small teams from this unit engaged in some very successful raids, particularly against Japanese shipping docked at Singapore harbor. The rate of survivability of the members of a mission was very low, it was not unreasonable to consider them suicide missions. This movie features a team of five members of the Z Special Unit going ashore from a submarine in order to find what may be survivors of the crash of an Allied airplane. Only the commander knows all of what they are there for and there is a significant Japanese presence on the land. After some fighting and with assistance from the non-Japanese locals, the team discovers that there were survivors of the crash and the viewer learns why they are considered so valuable. While there are some incredulous moments in the action, it is generally realistic. By this, the end results are a questionable outcome with deaths among the members of the Z Special Unit. The Japanese are depicted as being brutal in pursuit of their goals. There are no super soldier moments, they are all depicted as no more than well trained soldiers. It is a good movie and while a work of fiction, it could and likely did happen.",

      "reviewBody": "Irene Dunne is all in all herself, tender, transformative and powerful as an American girl who travels to England and falls in love with an English member of the aristocracy. Beautiful Irene marries the Englishman but their honeymoon is cut short on its first day as World War I breaks out. Director Clarence Brown&apos;s leisurely mood effect causes us to feel as disrupted as they do. Perhaps it is the soothing joy derived from the old-style black-and-white 35mm Spherical look, a classicism in George J. Folsey&apos;s cozy cinematography, that creates such a peaceful atmosphere. Believe me: This feeling is augmented by seeing it on a VHS tape, almost as though you are watching a timeworn relic. When the film quietly, serenely begins, Irene reflects upon her feelings relating to her life in England, a life she never expected to lead from event to event beginning with her purely dabbling arrival. The moving musical score fits like a velvet glove over the sustained close shot of her gorgeous face and the iceberg-thawing sound of her voice.\n\nThe backbiting between Irene and her English counterparts early in the film is funny, posing one of the movie&apos;s unanxious emotional successes which as well include strong romantic and maternal joys and longings, WWI, brief bursts of rage, mourning, WWII, and the like. A scene in the movie circa the early 1930s sends a chill down the spine, illustrating two polite adolescent German boys, part of an exchange program, staying at the English family&apos;s countryside manor. Intimating they were part of early Nazi invasion plans, the boys let it slip in a conversation&apos;s startling turn for the less comfortable that they are pondering how the estate&apos;s large green would be perfect on which for troop gliders to land.",

      "description": "London based American nurse, Lady Susan Ashwood (Irene Dunne), is at a hospital awaiting the imminent arrival of wounded soldiers. She is hoping that her enlisted son, Sir John Ashwood II (Peter Lawford), who resembles his father in appearance and temperament, is not amongst those wounded. As she waits, she remembers back to World War I when her husband, the former Sir John Ashwood (Alan Marshal), was enlisted, and the waiting she endured on any news from and about him while he was away in battle. From a humble background, Sue almost didn&apos;t meet Sir John, let alone marry him, as she and her father, Hiram Porter Dunn (Frank Morgan), the publisher of a small daily newspaper, were only in London in April 1914 on a two week vacation - her first trip - that was not going very well when by happenstance she got invited on her last day in London to the King&apos;s ball, where Sir John was awaiting the arrival of another young woman with whom he was supposed to keep company for the evening. Despite being mutually attracted to each other, the patriotic Sue didn&apos;t know whether she could leave the United States and get accustomed to John&apos;s family&apos;s aristocratic manners, as well as the English customs in general. She also thinks back to approximately ten years earlier when she was urged by her father to return to the States on the inevitability that the Germans would once again be the aggressors in a war. Through it all, Sue is a proud American, despite having lived the better part of her adult life in England.",

      "reviewBody": "Kids are running out of classrooms, shrieking and throwing papers in the air. A pop track pumps while the ubiquitous slow-mo panning camera follows the wannabes watching the popular girls strutting the corridor. That&apos;s right, school&apos;s out for summer in yet another John Hughes-inspired teen-flick.\n\nYou can loathe it, you can tolerate it, but I confess to a secret fondness of the genre. Although it&apos;s cluttered with ordinary films, this homogeneity is part of the unique comfort a teen comedy can offer. They&apos;re films to watch when you&apos;re sick, where bullies get their comeuppance, and moral codes are simpler than in an adult world. And kids enjoy them too.\n\nSleepover begins with Julie (Alexa Vega) inviting three friends for a slumber party to celebrate graduating from Junior High (Year 8). Of course, her former best friend Staci (Sara Paxton) can&apos;t come  she&apos;s a teen queen now. Sporting a superior blonde &apos;Farrah&apos; reminiscent of nasty Caroline (Haviland Morris) in Hughes&apos; Sixteen Candles (1984), you just know that Staci&apos;s a bitch with a heart of gold. She and her catty trio of &apos;Mean Girls&apos; challenge Julie and her buddies to a scavenger hunt. The winners get the coveted lunch spot at high school next year  and the passport to popularity. \n\nJulie, Hannah (Mika Boorem), Farrah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Yancy (Kallie Flynn Childress) sneak out of the house, avoiding Julie&apos;s renovation-mad dad and bribing her slacker brother. They&apos;re aided by three irritating Ashton Kutchner-aspirational types, chased by a rent-a-cop and come to rely on a tiny electric car that needs constant recharging. Plus Julie has to steal her secret crush&apos;s boxer shorts. Producer Chuck Weinstock came up with the idea of Sleepover because his previous projects were too adult in content for his six and nine-year old children to watch. But there are some edgy aspects in Sleepover that wouldn&apos;t have been included in the 1980s teen films it pays homage to. For example, 14-year old Staci has to fend off sexual advances from her high school beau  a rarity for girls that age in Hollywood films, although possibly not in real life. And in a later scene Julie has to persuade her teacher to buy her a drink called &quot;Sex on the Beach&quot; at a nightclub to win the competition. Though these elements are ignored in the broader context of the film, and may be inappropriate, they certainly make Sleepover more interesting.\n\nAlthough pleasant, Sleepover isn&apos;t one of the better examples of the genre. It&apos;s a disposable girly tween twist on Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off, but buoyed by Vega&apos;s strong screen presence. You know you shouldn&apos;t enjoy it, but you&apos;re probably going to. **½/***** stars.",

      "reviewBody": "Horror crime thriller meets schlager / hit film - second attempt\n\nVery similar to the film &quot;DAS RÄTSEL DER GRÜNEN SPINNE / The Mystery of the Green Spider&quot; (1960), which was made five years earlier, &quot;HOTEL DER TOTEN GÄSTE / Hotel of the Dead Guests&quot; (1965) is a very unusual mixture of Edgar Wallace-esque horror crime thriller and schlager / hit film. Two of the most successful genres in the German film industry were mixed to create a very special film cocktail. Well, in this case it only worked to a limited extent. The usual suspects of the Wallace stars give each other a hand (Joachim Fuchsberger, Karin Dor, Gisela Uhlen, Hans Nielsen, Ady Berber), but the spark doesn&apos;t really fly. It&apos;s a shame that Alfred Vohrer (&quot;He is a genius!&quot;, Quentin Tarantino already knew) wasn&apos;t available as a director! The most worth mentioning are the beautiful Renate Ewert (sexy and sassy as always) and a mysterious Monika Peitsch at a very young age.\n\nThe whole killing takes place around the Italian schlager / pop festival in San Remo, so that singing performances (but only two!) can be included in the plot. Heino&apos;s future wife Hannelore Auer sings, who three years later would also appear in the &quot;KOMMISSAR X&quot; franchise. What was particularly successful was the performance of the enchanting GOLDEN GLOBE winner Elke Sommer, who - here at the beginning of her world career - sang the song &quot;I say: No!&quot;.\n\nOf course, who the murderer is is not revealed. Recommended for anyone who appreciates the convoluted trials and tribulations of the Federal Republic film industry.",

      "reviewBody": "This epic period drama produced in the early-&apos;70s was Charlton Heston&apos;s third cinematic performance as Marc Antony a propos of versions of &apos;Julius Caesar&apos; produced earlier in his career in 1950 and 1970 - the latter starred that great English classical actor Sir John Gielgud as Caesar. Financed by Folio Films, the Rank Organisation, Zurich-based Transac and the Spanish backer Izaro Films and filmed at Madrid&apos;s Moro Studios, Alcazaba and Aranjuez plus the deserts of Tabernas in Almeria between June and August 1971 and released in that greyest of hippy years -1972 - this is a very credible, economic production and is full of classical things. I was most impressed by the visual relationships - a vigorous gladiatorial combat scene, the alien pyramids and temples, lavish costumes, interesting props that include a huge marble head of Apollo and statues of Venus, glittery bronze door panels, an ebony throne, high-stepping feather-plumed plumed Roman horses etc plus a lush romantic light classical score composed by John Scott. The abundant Spanish sun is astonishing and the camera records the zeitgeist and passage of time in the summer and autumn of 1971 so well. Heston&apos;s grandiloquent performance in some scenes can be compared to the flair of those other important American stars - Marlon Brando and Kirk Douglas in two adventure films: &apos;&apos;Burn!&apos;&apos; (1968-1970) and &apos;&apos;The Light at the Edge of the World&apos;&apos; (1971) respectively, also produced at the end of the &apos;60s/beginning of the &apos;70s. In the aftermath of the Battle of Actium, Heston with his hawk-like profile seems strangely self-willed - sporting an auburn caesar cut and black cape he bestrides the Mediterranean surf like a colossus - he shows an astonishing sense of projection. Antony&apos;s death scene - when he is stabbed by his servant features a strange Spanish night-time setting - the subdued light is very evocative while the funeral scene features a monumental square grey-blue slab and other interesting classical world props. The English actors - the young blond John Castle as Octavian and thin, greyhaired and dark-eyed Eric Porter as Enobarbus are very good. Charlton Heston&apos;s 16-year-old son Fraser was involved on the set and in an interview from 2009 featured on the retail DVD he remarks that his father was inspired by the &apos;mystique&apos; of Spain. Hildegard Neil who plays Cleopatra is married in real life to Yorkshireman Brian Blessed who played Augustus in the B. B. C. Period drama series &apos;&apos;I, Claudius&apos;&apos; (1976). For me, this is Chuck&apos;s second most interesting performance after his epic role in Peckinpah&apos;s &apos;&apos;Major Dundee&apos;&apos; (&apos;64-65) which was filmed in Mexico.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this one a couple years ago on Cinemax, and didn&apos;t think it was half bad.\n\nSure, the plot dragged at times, but how can you hate Turk 182? The film makers had good intentions.\n\nBasically, the plot revolves around a guy (Timothy Hutton) and his brother (Robert Urich) who is injured trying to save children from a fire. Because the guy was intoxicated at the time, the city refuses to foot his medical bills, regardless of the fact that he saved these poor kids from certain death. So, the Timothy Hutton character heckles the mayor by covering the city of New York in graffiti (long story).\n\nOverall, I thought it was a cool idea that was, for the most part, well executed by the cast and crew. So, if you can&apos;t find anything good on TV, check out Turk 182.\n\nZimmerman flew and Tyler knew! :-)"

Also an alternate retelling on how they met Yamcha, Blur, Oolong, Master Roshi, &amp; Turtle. Along the journey they will encounter representatives of the Red Ribbon Army who are also looking for the Dragon Balls.\n\nThe cool thing about this movie is it&apos;s the 10th Anniversary of the original TV series. The animation is newer and comparable to the GT series. Most of the characters look different including Commander Red, General Blue, &amp; General Silver.\n\nIt&apos;s twice as long as the previous 3, so it has more variety and more elements to watch. Those who are long time or new coming fans of Dragon Ball will agree that this one&apos;s the best movie of the original TV series.",

(pun intended) But it wasn&apos;t.\n\nWhere do I start ... bad BAD acting of almost everybody in the movie. Especially bad editing, sometimes there are cuts that have absolutely nothing to do with the current scene. Like near the beginning when you hear two people talking and at the same time see shots of people working silently on their computers. And don&apos;t get me started on the script.\n\nThen there&apos;s the &quot;logic factor&quot; once again. 666 giant robots are landing on major cities on earth, yet there are NO people on the streets, no hysteria, not even simple curiosity. Everybody is rather calm, like this would happen every day. It&apos;s like we (the unfortunate viewers of the movie) get to see them, but nobody else, apart from the principal actors.\n\nLike other people already mentioned, the superior aliens (in human form) are landing on earth. They have great powers and great knowledge. But a simple sedative knocks them out and an even simpler cell can hold them?\n\nIn general this *could* have been a nice variation on the original theme, that&apos;s why I gave it two instead of one points.\n\nIt may have been due to budget restrictions, or that they wanted to kick it out before the Keanu-movie. Either way, it did not do it any good.\n\nAs I said in the title: It&apos;s horrible in practically every way, don&apos;t waste your time on it.\n\nWatch the original or wait for Keanu.",

However, Bernie is the responsible for the theft and he asks his partner, the mobster Vito (Louis Giambalvo), to kill Larry and Richard. Vito assigns the hit man Paulie (Don Calfa) to kill Bernie instead since he is too greedy and is causing many troubles with the mafia and his girlfriend. Paulie kills Bernie with an overdose of heroin and when Larry and Richard arrive, they find their boss dead. But soon there is a party at his house and the guests do not notice that Bernie is dead. Among the guests, Jonathan sees his crush, the intern Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), and flirts with her. What will Larry and Jonathan do next?\n\n&quot;Weekend at Bernie&apos;s&quot; is a silly but funny black comedy. The joke is always the same, the film is stupid but most of the situations are gross and hilarious and in the end the viewer will certainly laugh a lot. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Um Morto Muito Louco&quot; (&quot;A Very Crazy Dead&quot;)",

Elmore Leonard is one of the best detective story writers today, but even as a co-script writer, he couldn&apos;t do much with this confusing picture, made from one of his books (a terrific read, incidentally). .Aside from the beautiful art direction, an excellent Chick Correa score that&apos;s never gotten much play, and a nicely edgy appearance by the late Charles Durning, the poor man&apos;s Sidney Greenstreet, &quot;Cat Chaser,&quot; set in the sultry, tropical Dominican Republic, is like wasting away in Margueritaville, sans Margueritas. .One saving grace is the dialogue -- vintage Elmore Leonard, especially the lines given to Charles Durning&apos;s character. Leonard is at the top of his game here and Durning&apos;s delivery, in his patented New York Irish accent, doesn&apos;t let him down. Peter Weller and Kelly McGillis are as unfetching a couple as possible. Director Abel Ferrara has done much better work elsewhere.",

      "reviewBody": "I became familiar with the Paul Morrissey-Joe Dallesandro trilogy by watching &quot;Flesh&quot;. I loved it, but there were many flaws that could not be overlooked (i.e., forgettable acting, bad editing and sound, boring intervals in plot). I did expect better with &quot;Trash&quot; and it delivered more than I wished for.\n\nJoe Dallesandro gives another fantastic performance as a junkie who will do anything for heroin. But unlike his appearance in &quot;Flesh&quot;, Joe barely creates any sexual longing from the audience. The plotline is simple: Joe wants heroin, his girlfriend Holly wants welfare, and you get to see some strange characters and situations as they try to reach their goal(s). Morrissey produced several winning actors in &quot;Flesh&quot;, one of which was Geri Miller as a ditzy but lovable stripper. Geri plays another ditzy but lovable stripper and is just as good, if not better, here. For those of you who remember hearing her conversation about choosing between plant juice or silicone for her breast implants, you can&apos;t help but wonder which she picked, for in a stripping sequence, Geri&apos;s breasts are noticeably larger. It is in this film that I noticed Morrissey&apos;s casting is similar to that of John Waters: Morrissey-Geri Miller; Waters-Cookie Mueller Morrissey-Jane Forth; Waters-Mary Vivian Pearce Morrissey-Andrea Feldman; Waters-Edith Massey (in the &quot;where the hell did they come from?&quot; category)\n\nCandy Darling and Jackie Curtis are gone from the cast, but to take both of their places is Holly Woodlawn, who steals the film from absolutely everybody! She was supposed to have been nominated for an Oscar for her performance in this film, but because Holly is a transvestite, there was questioning as to which category? She is fabulous, better than any other Warhol star before or since, and is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Andrea Feldman is a wild, outrageous character actress and while her voice is annoying, her personality is interesting. Jane Forth, a 16-year-old actress, has an equally annoying voice, but her performance as a talkative rich snob is great. Other notable appearances include Johnny Putnam, who was Holly Woodlawn&apos;s 16-year-old boyfriend, as a teen looking for dope and Michael Sklar as the welfare officer. Diane Podlewski as Holly&apos;s pregnant sister and Bruce Pecheur as Jane&apos;s husband aren&apos;t as memorable.\n\n&quot;Trash&quot; features better editing style, better sound quality, better improvised dialogue, better stylistic camerawork, great sets, and a MUCH better ensemble cast. I would recommend this film more than any other Morrissey film besides perhaps &quot;Blood for Dracula&quot;. Highly recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Great literature seldom makes for great cinema. The mediums are vastly different. However great literature, in the right hands, can make for very entertaining cinema. Such is the case with Guy Ritchie&apos;s interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s greatest character.\n\nMr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce &quot;Holmes and Watson&quot;. Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.\n\nWhat is not missing is Holmes&apos; world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.\n\nOf course, I won&apos;t reveal any details of the story other than to say the &quot;good&quot; guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey&apos;s physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.\n\nThis is a BIG movie! It is made to be a rollicking good time with tons of popcorn munched. Smaller kids will not be able to follow the story, but anyone who has read a Holmes story (and isn&apos;t against a little artistic license) should see the film. It is extremely entertaining and fun to watch.",

The few combat scenes were filmed and choreographed to great effect. I am not sure how historically accurate this movie is, but it works as an enchanting piece of cinema. Highly recommended to anyone who likes art films and historical epics. Seriously, the locations make me want to take a vacation to the steppes immediately.",

Despite other reviews I found it quite well done how both plots intertwined. \n\nAs an audio professional I found some sound parts of the film difficult to stomach, especially the party scene where slow-dancing and speaking at the same time-here rough cuts are clearly audible and it&apos;s enough to take away from the great use of David Bowie&apos;s music in this scene, a real shame. \n\nBeyond that thought I was very impressed with Brühl, that quatri-lingual dreamboat, whom I have until now only seen on German films.

It&apos;s really a kid&apos;s story, dressed up as a family movie. It&apos;s also a simple tale, requiring a simple plot and that is what you get, along with some Spielberg magic. The (gas) scene in Buckingham Palace is one of the funniest I&apos;ve ever seen - it was hysterical! If you want to get all serious and pick fault with the plot line, you shouldn&apos;t be watching this kind of movie. It&apos;s a fantasy movie, involving some.... well... fantasy! There were some stereotypical British elements, which to us might be a bit overdone, but Spielberg isn&apos;t British. Whoever is slating this movie&apos;s plot and the movie in general obviously doesn&apos;t remember: E.T, Back to the Future; Poltergeist etc, who&apos;s plot lines were crackpot in the extreme. BFG is what it is... a lighthearted and delightful fantasy, which kids and adults will adore together.",

      "reviewBody": "Among the two dozen or so westerns Audie Murphy made for Universal Pictures from 1950-1966, DRUMS ACROSS THE RIVER (1954) is one of the better ones, featuring a gold miners-vs.-Indians plot with Audie caught firmly in the middle. It&apos;s fast-paced, full of action, and features a host of lively character actors, including some great villains.\n\nAudie plays a wagon freighter in a Colorado mining town who is, initially, a witting pawn in a plot by a group of Denver mine bosses to stir up trouble with the local Ute Indians in order to get gold concessions on their land. Audie&apos;s dad, Sam (Walter Brennan), is a friend of the Indians and, following a shootout with the Utes in which Sam is wounded, Audie meets with the Ute chief (Morris Ankrum) and his son Taos (Jay Silverheels) and negotiates a temporary peace. Unfortunately, the hired guns working for the mine bosses continue to stir things up and force Audie to aid in a stage robbery by abducting his dad and threatening to kill him. When Audie is charged with murder after the robbery, he has to keep quiet to insure Sam&apos;s safety. In the final stretch of the movie, Audie has to break free, save his dad, subdue the bad guys, clear himself and avert a battle between Indians and cavalry. The whole story is told in 78 compact minutes.\n\nUnassuming war hero-turned-western star Murphy was at his best in parts like this, playing an ordinary westerner caught up in a tumultuous situation and having to fight his way out and summon up the moral courage to do the right thing. He always looked best when he faced down truly formidable bad guys and here he faces one of the best western villains of the 1950s. Lyle Bettger, who had one of the most sinister smiles in movie history, specialized in corrupt western capitalists (ranchers, miners, saloon owners, railroad men) who could be utterly smooth and charming one minute and murderously evil the next. Here he&apos;s the miners&apos; lead troublemaker and is joined by a great rogues&apos; gallery made up of future TV star Hugh O&apos;Brian as the black-clad Morgan, who also smiles a lot, and a quartet of thugs played by frequent heavies James Anderson, George Wallace, Lane Bradford and former B-western star Bob Steele. In addition, there&apos;s Mara Corday as a voluptuous (and very attractive) saloon girl who does some of Bettger&apos;s dirty work.\n\n Walter Brennan is very good in a rare turn as an upright authority figure and father. Jay Silverheels plays a sympathetic Indian and leads a band of Utes who appear to be played predominantly by actual Indians rather than the usual painted-up white extras. The Technicolor film was shot partly on the Universal backlot with some fine location work at key California western sites, including one dramatic desert spot representing the Indians&apos; sacred burial ground. This was director Nathan Juran&apos;s third film with Murphy."

      "reviewBody": "This film is made as a documentary. (Available with English subtitles.) At the time, McDonald&apos;s was planning to open a store in Altamura, Italy. The citizens think it&apos;s a terrible idea. The filmmaker follows several of them as the story progresses. The town is apparently renowned for its focaccia. The townspeople can&apos;t imagine why anyone would want to eat &quot;fast food&quot; when their town provides such good food.\n\nA subplot involves a stranger, Manuel, who arrives in a yellow sports car, wearing a bright red jacket (note the colors). He tries to win the affections of Ms Rosa, but annoys everybody.\n\nThe scene switches back and forth a few times between Altamura and New York, where we see the McDonalds Headquarters and Museum. There are &quot;interviews&quot; with many of the local inhabitants - shop owners, bakers, restaurant owners, a movie theater owner, the local chief of police.\n\nIn the end, McDonald&apos;s just cancels the deal and goes away, and Manuel loses Rosa, when he doesn&apos;t like her focaccia (one of the best scenes in the movie).\n\nIt&apos;s a good look at Italian culture. One bit through the interviews shows the city rivalry between two men from different cities. Watch through the outtakes over the final credits.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the best movies I have seen this year. Michael Winterbottom proves to be a truly versatile director with this film about love, loneliness, sorrow and obsession in an English coastal town. The use of Elvis Costello&apos;s song &quot;I want you&quot; as a theme throughout the film is superb. It leaves you with a strange and yearning sensation that will last for days. The cinematography is so very good, thanks to Kieslowskis photographer Zlavomir Idziak who also filmed &quot;Gattaca&quot; creating a similar visual style. Wonderful yellow, green and blue renders a supernatural, poetic feel to the characters as well as the town. You watch with the feeling that anything can happen, and it does.\n\nThe casting of this movie is almost perfect. Rachel Weisz is equally true as the both innocent and dangerous Helen as she was in &quot;The Mummy&quot; playing a librarian with vigour, looks and brains. I predict hers to be a great career. Make way, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham-Carter! Alessandro Nivola as Martin is just as persuasive. He is scary, touching, pathetic and assertive all at the same time, consumed by an obsession with Helen fuelled by eight years in jail.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me about this movie is the way it abandons the mute boy and his sister&apos;s story to concentrate on Helen and Martin. However, this is a minor detail in a movie that often bears visual reminders of Derek Jarman at his very best. The very self-conscious references to &quot;Romeo is bleeding&quot; and &quot;Red rock west&quot; will probably ensure a similar cult-following before long."

Yes, this is the installment in the interminable &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series that thought it would be a good idea to do without its only reason for existence...the hockey-masked Jason. Though you hardly notice the loss, since you don&apos;t KNOW it&apos;s not Jason until the film&apos;s final moments, and the copycat killer dresses like Jason anyway, so what&apos;s the difference? If you&apos;ve seen one axe-wielding psycho in a hockey mask, you&apos;ve seen them all.\n\nActually, I kind of like this entry. It provides the best nudity of the series....no fewer than three gratuitous boob shots, and nice boobs they are. And it&apos;s funny, sometimes intentionally so, as when the hillbilly mom calls her dufus son a dildo, sometimes unintentionally, as when the Michael Jackson look alike sings a duet with his girlfriend through an outhouse wall while he&apos;s on the crapper.\n\nAnd the filmmakers outdo themselves with the body count this time around. By the end of the movie, there&apos;s no longer time to show them being killed off. Characters you&apos;ve completely forgotten about just pop up as dead bodies. But what do you expect with all that plot to get through? Compared to the other films in the series, this is practically &quot;War and Peace,&quot; what with the murder mystery story and the Tommy Jarvis plot line, which attempts to add a sense of continuity to the middle batch of movies (o.k. so Part 6 picks up Tommy&apos;s storyline in a completely different place and with a different actor, but for a series like this that&apos;s the best you can hope for in the way of consistency).\n\nGrade: C",

He&apos;s a rare voice in the sense that his opinions place him at-odds with his religious homeland, decrying the lack of a Palestinian state and brow-beating the Israeli government for their part in allegedly whitewashing the conflict. It should come as no surprise that such a vocal, incendiary stance has made him all manner of powerful enemies, and his sharp, confrontational personal nature does him no further favors in that respect. Finkelstein at his best is intriguing, an engaging speaker with a fiery streak and the credentials, both personal and scholastic, to back him up against any opponent. Sadly, he also seems doomed to a fate of self-contradiction. He often employs the very same methods in his own tricky public speaking engagements that he vehemently decries in the opposition, even if this documentary does try its very best to clip and trim around such moments. It&apos;s just one side of a very complicated debate, and while he does make some convincing points that refute the official story from the United States and Israel, it can be difficult to accept his story and make a judgment without an equally eloquent counterpoint in play.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Straight Shooting&quot; is of historical interest for many reasons, including the grouping of Harry Carey, Hoot Gibson, and John Ford.\n\nEven this early in his career, Ford knew how to frame a shot, and many a beautiful shot here involved framing in doorways and windows.\n\nCarey&apos;s character seemed often modeled on those so frequently portrayed by William S. Hart, whom Carey in some ways copied: both were Easterners who wanted to be Westerners, and both beautifully presented to us a picture of the rugged and basically decent character we want to think of as the essential Westerner.\n\nHoot Gibson was about 25 here but looked younger. He never was especially good-looking but he was always, in every movie I&apos;ve seen him in, likable, and always one of the greatest of cowboys. At this stage, he&apos;d been in pictures for about seven years.\n\nProviding the love interest, but also much more, was a lovely young lady -- though at age 29 not so young as the part she played -- who frequently reminded me of the wonderful Mae Marsh. She seems to be relatively unknown although she has 88 credits here at IMDb, all in silent films.\n\nSo, yes, there is motion picture history here, the early years of some movie icons, a foreshadowing of some great careers, but the editing ... oy.\n\nMany early movies suffered from some scenes, frequently static, that seemed to run on and on and on. Even D.W. Griffith allowed some pointless, non-moving shots to just hang, for no apparent reason.\n\nHere we have the exact opposite problem. Probably because of sloppy editing, far too many scenes or angles are just cut off. It&apos;s hard to tell who is doing what to whom, and why. Even in the middle of the big battle, people aim, others fall, and it is confusing as to who is who and whether we should care: bad guys or good guys?\n\nYet, some other scenes, of Cheyenne Harry just staring, do go on and on, a fairly amateurish effort at showing the character pondering ... and pondering ... and pondering. By no means just once.\n\nPerhaps, too, at least part of the problem is the version presented at YouTube. Though official run time is listed as 57 minutes, the version I saw is 2 hours and 13 minutes! For who-knows-what-reason, after &quot;The End,&quot; the middle of the movie starts again! (Frankly, at YouTube, many a movie is uploaded by a liar or an incompetent, or both! And there seems to be no way to get YouTube to call down the offender.)\n\n&quot;Straight Shooting&quot; is a movie every Western fan, every John Ford fan, every Harry Carey fan, every Hoot Gibson fan -- and each of those includes me -- should watch, if only for the chance to see the early years of their film work.\n\nMore than that, though, it is a good story, with good characterizations, and so intriguing in the directing.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence of D.W. Griffith influence, and at least one shot seems directly taken from &quot;The Birth of a Nation.&quot; But &quot;Straight Shooting&quot; is generally exciting as well as interesting and very definitely worth watching.",
