      "reviewBody": "On an island beach a woman vows to avenge her brother&apos;s death at the hands of a pirate leader. With help, the woman spies on the pirates and then gets a job as bodyguard to the pirate leader.\n\nAllegedly, in the original plan, &quot;Noroît&quot; would have followed &quot;Duelle&quot; (1976) as the third episode of the intended four-film series Scènes de la vie parallèle (the first being a supernatural love story and the fourth a musical). This film does have some similar themes to &quot;Duelle&quot;, most notably that it is classified as an &quot;experimental fantasy&quot;.\n\nThose looking for a straight-up revenge story with pirates may want to look elsewhere. This is a fine film, but the pirates seem more like an acting troupe without a theater than a serious gang of scalawags to be afraid of.",

Even though they are all passable actors, Cagney is somehow in a different league. The downside was that by outshining his co-stars, their contributions make the whole film seem a little amateurish. The upside was that to keep up with him eventually everyone had to get up to his standard but this hadn&apos;t quite happened by 1933.\n\nThis film is super-fast, super-snappy and both reasonably funny and gripping at the same time. Overseen by Warner&apos;s production head Daryl Zanuck, it was written specifically for Cagney to highlight his own particular talents and loveable rogue personality.\n\nWarner Brothers knew exactly what they were doing - making a star and making a lot of money but didn&apos;t account for Cagney&apos;s demands for staggeringly enormous wages. They did their sums and reluctantly always gave in - just watching him in this you can see why.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a very good film centering around a murder investigation and trial involving a chief deputy DA and a beautiful, young attorney in his office who is found murdered one morning.  The direction, screenplay, and acting are all top notch and you never really know how it&apos;s going to turn out til the very end.\n\nHarrison Ford is the deputy DA accused of murdering one of the female attorneys in his office.  Ford&apos;s character is that of a strident upholder of the law who strays into marital infidelity.  Caroline Polhemus, played by Greta Scacchi, is beautiful and manipulative, using her sexuality to get what she wants, career advancement and power.\n\nFord is assigned to head the murder investigation team, however, his boss, played by Brian Dennehy, loses his re-election bid a few weeks later and the new district attorney charges Ford with Caroline&apos;s murder.  He knows Ford had had an affair with the victim and has physical evidence that he was at the murder scene and had been placing phone calls to her apartment in the days prior to her death.\n\nThe continuing investigation by Harrison Ford&apos;s team of lawyers and his friends in the DA&apos;s office and the trial highlight the remainder of this film.  Events take strange twists and turns and the viewer is taken along for the ride without really knowing where it will take him.  The ending is a bit of a surprise and neatly ties everything together.\n\nThe direction by Alan J. Pakula is tight and suspenseful.  I thought it was his best film since the early days when he directed &quot;Klute&quot; and &quot;The Parallax View&quot; - certainly better than the muddled &quot;Pelican Brief.&quot;  The overriding theme of the movie is darkness, people hiding secrets from one another, and the direction emphasizes that.  There are very few outdoor daytime scenes and most of the interior shots are of dark rooms and corridors.\n\nHarrison Ford is good in the role of the besieged deputy DA, but I thought the secondary actors were the ones who made this picture as good as it was. Raul Julia plays Ford&apos;s attorney defending him in court and he&apos;s excellent (I thought it was his best role in any film).  He&apos;s urbane and confident, and he steers the defense through a very difficult set of circumstances.\n\nBonnie Bedelia plays Ford&apos;s wife and her character is much more complex than that of the supportive wife standing by her man.  She also has dark secrets of her own and she plays the part with sly understatement.  John Spencer (&quot;L.A. Law&quot;) plays an investigator in the DA&apos;s office helping Ford, Brian Dennehy plays Ford&apos;s boss who turns on him, and Paul Winfield plays the judge handling the trial, and all are excellent. \n\nMy only criticisms would come from Harrison Ford&apos;s character, who is so emotionally detached that it makes the circumstances of the affair with Greta Scacchi unbelievable.  He&apos;s not an easy person to identify with or feel sympathy for, but the film is so well done that you can easily skip over that void and just sit back and enjoy the performances.",

      "reviewBody": "Having only ever seen one Angelopoulos film before - The Travelling Players, which thrilled me about as much as paint drying on a wall - I was unprepared for the revelation that is The Suspended Step of the Stork. Shot over a decade ago, this long metaphysical tale of desperate refugees and disenchanted politicians has become more contemporary with each intervening year. As if a lone Greek film-maker had somehow prophesied the horrors of Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq - and the creeping paralysis that has overtaken Western democracy.\n\nIt begins in a refugee camp on the Greek-Albanian border, where a TV journalist spots an elderly man (Marcello Mastroianni) and decides he is a leading politician who went missing years before. Tracing the man&apos;s &apos;widow&apos; (Jeanne Moreau) the reporter gropes his way towards the film&apos;s central dilemma. What could make a progressive intellectual lose all faith in humanity, to the extent that he gives up not only his political career but also his very identity?\n\nThis sounds like dry stuff indeed, and so it might be without the alchemical power of Angelopoulous&apos;s camera. There are sequences here that beg for inclusion in an anthology of all-time cinema greats. The tracking-shot along a disused train, each carriage inhabited by a penniless refugee family. The wedding across the river, with bride and groom stranded on opposite sides by the arbitrary idiocy of national borders, which veers perilously close to kitsch but never succumbs.\n\nMoreau is magnificent, Mastroianni his genial hangdog self, but neither actor could ever mistake this film for a star vehicle. If there is a star here, it&apos;s the soul of humanity itself. A soul neither living nor dead, but held in suspended animation."

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed Bless The Child, and the good performance of Kim Basinger, but when all was said and done, I could not help dwelling on the films shortcomings, fallacies and holes.\n\n1 Length.  At 1hr 38mins, it is a good 35 minutes shorter than the average film nowadays, and this, while making it a shorter (and therefore more palatable...???logic???) for the punters, the film was unable to do justice to the themes and characters it created.\n\n2 The common fallacy among films that deal with themes of world domination and conquest.  Why America, and more specifically, why New York?  Why was the child born in America, and why was the bad guy looking in New York for it?  Surely if (as the casting implies) the child is the product of the stereotypical inbred mutant hicks (complete with red hair and feckles a la &quot;Carrie&quot;, 1976...also &quot;The Gift&quot;, 2000) of Southern US, then why New York and not Smallsville Texas?  These kind of issues are completely ignored, and indeed MUST be in a film this short.\n\n3 Bad guy.  It is either an amazing co-incidence that he found and married the mother, or there was some force that brought her to him.  Does he marry all drugged out homeless people? Or does he think the best place to look for mothers of children born on the special date is in rehab centres?  Again, undealt with.  Does he have supernatural powers or not?  How come he can cast a spell to make a guy want to commit suicide, and yet can be simply killed with a few lead pellets?  Earlier in the movie he manages to magic the bullets out of Kim&apos;s gun - why couldn&apos;t he do it with the FBI guy? Surely a supernatural guy deserves a supernatural death.\n\n4 - What of the nuns? How do they know that Kim is on her way with the child?  We never see her tell them she is on her way.  Also the obligatory FBI agent - when he is told that &quot;they have got Cody&quot;, he seems to know that Cody has been rescued and her recapture is news to him, yet he is never told in the first place.  When the nuns pray, are we to assume that because there are more of them, God is more likely to hear them, and give a quantitative response?  If they hadn&apos;t prayed, would God have just sat back and watched as his new messiah got diced?  If not, then why have the nun-praying scene when there are so many holes undealt with?\n\n5 - What of this mysterious Christian anti-occult cult led by Ian Holm?  Why don&apos;t they have superpowers like the occult guys?  All they do is get a young guy to drive a car for Kim, and then he dies before the getaway.  Why can&apos;t they become angels for a second, like the demon granny does?  That would have been cool.  This sub-plot came accross as just the lets-explain-some-of-the-rules part of the film, which should have come in much earlier.  Then again, they don&apos;t stick to their own rules, so I guess it doesnt really matter.\n\nIt is my guess that the film was an adaptation of a book (these often make too many assumptions) and that there was some psycho reel cutter in the editing room who had &quot;shorter is better, shorter is better&quot; going round in his head.  The way I felt about the film was this: nice dress rehearsal - when are you going to make the film?\n\n6/10 - hordes of unused potential",

      "reviewBody": "A film sometimes will stay with you for an inexplicable reason. This time, it&apos;s not so hard to figure out - Nagisa Oshima decided to make a film that is not too long, maybe 90 minutes or so (I forget the exact running time), set most of it in one location, and make it about how human nature is just really, really strange sometimes. Especially in Japan. Now, contrary to what the title says, it&apos;s not really a film about suicide, at least not fully. One of the main characters IS fascinated by wanting to off himself, and keeps on trying to find a way to do it. And he&apos;s accompanied by a young 18 year old woman who is quite aroused and wants to get her rocks off with another man. Then there is the other guy who is just really hyped up on guns. \n\nBut what is the movie about? Well, I&apos;m still not sure if it has an exact narrative that can be seen as A-B-and-C straight through. It&apos;s more in line with something like the Exterminating Angel, as close as I can figure, as it&apos;s about how the suicide guy and horny girl are walking along one night (he her boyfriend, sorta), and they get caught up in a hide-out where a bunch of men are paranoid about a war starting, or some kind of attack. And their fears are amped up by reports on the news of a white-American gunman taking out people at random. There is a lock-down, but the people in this big gray hangar could leave whenever they want. But things keep on happening to keep them there...\n\nIt&apos;s maybe a film that most pointedly and wonderfully looks at male frustration and nihilism, with this one girl who keeps trying to have something with a man (and failing, not for lack of being attractive but just because the men are pre-occupied with their &quot;guns&quot; so to speak), and paranoia in general. I loved the atmosphere of everything in this one place, as the people are there and they don&apos;t leave, at least until the last fifteen minutes or so. When they do leave, Oshima makes some real suspense and action, but not how one would expect. It&apos;s technically a thriller, but everything is underlying, and the suspense isn&apos;t for the when but how things will happen. I loved it, but it&apos;s definitely an acquired taste.",

This third is a must see in the &quot;set&quot;, but I have to say, it&apos;s not my favorite. It&apos;s very hard to compete with the excellent first 2 movies. I didn&apos;t like that Charlie isn&apos;t played often enough. I also did care for the actors that starred as Mrs. Clause&apos;s parents. Yes, Ann-Margaret and Alan Arkin are terrific actors, but not perfect for this role as the in-laws, I thought. Martin Short was excellent! He is so evil and he does it well! Lucy is a doll! She stole the movie. I loved this movie... it&apos;s a great end to the other two, but I don&apos;t think they should make any more. Curtis&apos;s role as an elf was better when he was a kid! Yes, Bernard&apos;s appearance was highly missed. If you loved the first two, see this 3rd, otherwise wait until October of next year to rent it.",

You may say that it isn&apos;t supposed to be an action movie but I would answer that a documentary does need a little substance to keep us interested and this movie failed in that regard. If you watch this you will hear long discussions between young pampered American guys about the suffering of being a tulku (which they are supposed to be)and you will have the feeling that the goal of all that is to show you how interesting and special they are. The short interviews with Dzongsar Rinpoche,the famous film maker Tibetan lama that made the critically acclaimed film The Cup,are quite interesting,in fact maybe the only interesting part in the movie,but unfortunately this part is quite short and you can see most of it in the trailer.",

      "reviewBody": "I rented this film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly &apos;50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length Superman film. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised.\n\nAn experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor. Lois and Clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. A day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive Mole Men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth&apos;s core.\n\nSupermen and the Mole Men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. Released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. To drive this point home in a typically straightforward Superman manner, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the Mole Men of being &apos;Nazis&apos; at one point.\n\nEven in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. Six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the &quot;hollow center of the earth&quot; - which, in any case does not exist. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.\n\nThe film is a little unevenly paced. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By today&apos;s standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film&apos;s special effects and costuming were quite good. The cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.",

      "name": "Like &quot;To the Rescue&quot;, this is another rather bland sequel",
      "reviewBody": "This was released as the second film in the &quot;Brave Little Toaster&quot; trilogy, but is actually the final adventure. The third film, &quot;The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue&quot;, takes place in between the original and this one. After all these years, I&apos;ve finally seen the two late 90&apos;s direct-to-video sequels to the barely theatrical 1987 original, which I saw many times in my childhood, probably mostly before the sequels were made. I knew these two sequels weren&apos;t that popular, so I didn&apos;t have very high expectations for them. As it turns out, it&apos;s good I didn&apos;t, or I would have been let down. Neither of them is any match for the bizarre 80&apos;s Hyperion Pictures production, though both of them have their moments. &quot;The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars&quot; might be the worst of the three.\n\nRob, known as &quot;The Master&quot; to his childhood appliances, has graduated from college and become a veterinarian. He is now married to his long-term girlfriend, Chris, and they live in rural house, along with Rob&apos;s old appliances (Toaster, Blanky, Kirby, Lampy, and Radio), and Ratso. One day, the couple returns home with a new baby boy, Robbie. At first, the appliances are not sure how this will work out for them, but soon find themselves enjoying the company of the &quot;Little Master&quot;. One night, the Hearing Aid, who lives in the kitchen drawer, sneaks upstairs while everyone else is asleep. The Toaster wakes up and can tell he&apos;s up to something, so he tells the others about it the next day. The following night, they all witness Robbie being sucked out the window in a beam of light, and soon learn that he has been taken to Mars! In order to try and get the baby back before his parents wake up and realize he is gone, the Red Planet is where the appliances must go!\n\nLike the other two installments in the trilogy, this one features a bunch of songs. The baby song near the beginning seemed awfully sappy for a &quot;Brave Little Toaster&quot; song to me, but I guess the rest of them aren&apos;t that bad. I thought it would be kind of interesting seeing our appliance heroes on their only adventure away from Earth, but to me, it wasn&apos;t too entertaining after all. Neither of the sequels&apos; plots can match the appliances&apos; first adventure. The part where the appliances (original and new ones) are on their way to Mars and meet a bunch of helium balloons floating in space I found to be a weak moment, but I guess it&apos;s more for kids. &quot;The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars&quot; also lacks humour, much like &quot;To the Rescue&quot;, but maybe even more so. There were parts I found amusing, such as Ratso making baby sounds into the intercom, but I don&apos;t think there were too many others. With Wayne Knight providing the voice of the Microwave, the character definitely could have been funnier.\n\nI probably would consider this sequel slightly inferior to &quot;The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue&quot;, but I feel I could give it the same rating, 6/10, instead of 5. Looking back, it doesn&apos;t seem all that bad, and has a pretty good ending. However, I certainly couldn&apos;t give either sequel the 8/10 I gave to the original. I haven&apos;t read Thomas M. Disch&apos;s &quot;Brave Little Toaster&quot; books, which the films are based on, but now that I&apos;ve seen the entire film trilogy, I think the 1987 original was aimed at all ages, whereas the two late 90&apos;s sequels are more for kids. I&apos;m not saying all adults should avoid them like the plague, I&apos;ve seen worse kiddie flicks, but if you&apos;re an adult fan of the original, you could easily be disappointed by them. Regardless of your age, if you&apos;re going to watch all three movies, I suggest you watch this one last (even though it came in the middle), after you&apos;ve seen the original and the other sequel, or else you could get confused.",

It turns out that Shiloh belongs to an ornery hunter named Judd who lives nearby. Judd only sees Shiloh as a tool for hunting and doesn&apos;t believe animals have any rights. For Marty, however, Shiloh quickly becomes a friend and companion. \n\nThe story unfolds around the struggle between Marty and Judd for ownership of Shiloh. That may sound a little corny, but issues of family, honesty, respect for other species and the importance of keeping promises soon become involved. \n\nAs an animal lover I found the story compelling and I&apos;m going to watch it again soon with my grandchildren.",

      "reviewBody": "Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written, badly conceived, silly 1960s children&apos;s movies - but I really can&apos;t understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure, most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends, but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey, at least it&apos;s not a remake, a sequel, or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect.\n\nSanta Claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians (white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads, as well as inexplicable capes), who want to rescue their depressive, antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big red-suited guy with a beard to laugh at... err... with. Santa adapts to life on Mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of Martian machines, but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of Martian Society.\n\nI&apos;m not kidding.... really.... this is the plot.\n\nAside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting (Bill McCutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film, though Pia Zadora and Vincent Beck are not too bad), this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time. In the age of ADD and general impatience, however, this film is more than a little dated. The only modern kid I can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for B-films. In terms of production, this film has the feel of a 2 hour, 1960s low budget TV show, and is almost as clever.\n\nI would recommend avoiding this film unless you&apos;re compelled to watch films which go to extremes. I found it cute, funny, and more than a tad ridiculous. To most people, it&apos;s a film version of your great Aunt&apos;s wallpaper - it&apos;s just there on the TV, while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet.",

In the nick of time &quot;The Unborn&quot; turned up.\n\nMake no mistake, &quot;The Unborn&quot; was a real stinker. A horror in the worst sense of the word. I cannot imagine the wager that fine actors like Gary Oldman and Carla Gugino must have lost to get them to appear in this poo, but it must have been a big one.\n\nHurrah! There were some good things.\n\nSome of the twisted body imagery was quite effective. (It was effective when it first appeared in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, twenty six years ago.) Also, Megan Fox lookalike Odette Yustman looked quite nice in her underwear.\n\nBoo! There were many more bad things.\n\nA predictable plot, cobbled together from a million other direct-to-video movies. No tension or scares whatsoever, with every story twist sign posted miles ahead. Awful acting, of course, with &apos;best friend&apos; Meagan Good being top of the list of shame. Slow, boring, terrible.\n\nI thought that &quot;The Unborn&quot; was absolutely dreadful. A rotten film.\n\nAvoid.",

Kajol is superb too; she isn&apos;t much different here. Arbaaz Khan plays the tough elder brother very well. You can&apos;t fault Dharmendra; he is consistent throughout. \n\nVerdict: If you don&apos;t watch it, you&apos;ll miss out on tons of entertainment. I give it 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Scene: a foot with a face on it is merrily hopping around a countertop. Meanwhile a slutty nurse is talking about economic strategies of a criminal organization. Three identical idiots are watching on with titillation. The boss is hunched over the foot with great consternation, repeating &quot;That&apos;s just damn weird.&quot;\n\nWTF??\n\nWho here grew up on comic books, raise your hands. The dork madly flailing in the back would be me. In order to appreciate this film it requires some familiarity with the comic book medium and its ability to take us into an utterly bizarre, senseless and oftimes brainless world. Situations are surreal. Dialogue is snippy, contrived and just a snicker away from utterly ludicrous. That&apos;s what comic books do, and this film is one of the most faithful adaptations I&apos;ve seen.\n\nThose who criticize this movie for &quot;bad script&quot;, &quot;bad acting&quot;, etc would have a point if we were talking about some snotty, pretentious too-cool-for-mainstream flick, but no, this is the opposite: pure fun. I mean, jeez, when the bad guy pauses in the middle of a tense battle to talk about eggs... or when he gets into a debate with one of his henchmen over the job&apos;s healthcare benefits, how can you NOT have fun?? Instead of expecting an action film, you should go into it expecting something more like &quot;Airplane!&quot; and I guarantee you&apos;ll have a great time &amp; some big laughs. Like when one guy commits hara-kiri with a samurai sword and says &quot;Am I doing this right? It sorta smarts.&quot; OMG LOL. And there&apos;s plenty more where that came from, but I won&apos;t spoil it.\n\nBoth Samuel L Jackson &amp; Scarlett Johansson as his deadpan sidekick deliver top-notch comedic performances with pinpoint timing. Set against a wickedly incongruous backdrop of &quot;film noir&quot; where madcap comedy is definitely against the rules, &quot;The Spirit&quot; presents us with one of the greatest bipolar contrasts since &quot;Catch-22&quot; (the greatest deadpan action flick ever).\n\nAnd just a word about contrast, I&apos;m sure that&apos;s part of Frank Miller&apos;s intent, seeing how the film is full of biting visual contrasts. I won&apos;t even go into how masterfully he brought the comic book visuals to life; you just gotta see it.\n\nIf you like witty, tongue-in-cheek, dark comedies, then this is the film for you. A lot of action films are peppered with wit &amp; humour, but this is one of the few that crosses into outright comedy, and it does a great job. If you like this film, keep an eye out for the Japanese flick &quot;Cutie Honey&quot;, another great, artistic, campy romp which was misunderstood by audiences and overlooked.\n\nIf any of what I&apos;ve said resonates with you, I strongly urge you to run down to your local Blockbuster where you can find this film in the $2 bargain bin, watch it &amp; get in early on the cult following. It may be 10 years before people come to appreciate what Frank Miller did here, but you can say, &quot;I told you so!&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "Purani Haveli seems to be the last better flick from the House of Ramsays&apos;. The film was released somewhere around 1989 and casts most of the actors that were simply tagged as horror veterans during the mid and late 80s. The film is long as most of the other Bollywood horror films of that time and features a mishmash of 3-4 tales, entwined with one other but they somehow work and doesn&apos;t leave the movie as boring as Ramsays&apos; other horror films like &apos;Tahkhana,&apos; &apos;Mahakaal,&apos; and &apos;Ajooba Kudrat Ka&apos;.\n\nThe film begins with a couple Raja (Anil Dhawan) and Rita (Priti Sapru) who unintentionally land up at a grand Haveli not really knowing its dire past. The couple succumbs to the peaceful atmosphere of the Haveli and believe that they have found a good place to spend night in the woods. As the Haveli is jinxed, the pair soon discovers that the Haveli is the lair of a wicked ghoul, who would kill anyone that comes there. Raja is soon killed by the ghost (Manek Irani, aka the notorious Billa), and Rita also meets the same consequence. We see an old man, who lives by the Haveli, somehow tackle the monster with a holy cross, then cage and lock him down in the basement.\n\nWe then see a small time photographer Sunil (Deepak Parashar), who is overwhelmingly in love with a rich lass Anita (Amita Nangiya). Ever since her parents died, Amita was looked after and brought up by her uncle Kumar (Vijay Arora). However Kumar and his wife Seema (Neelam Mehra) have spun a web of deceit and lies around Anita and are only looking for the good time to get control of Anita&apos;s financial assets. Anita trusts her uncle and aunt and never questions their intention. Seema wants Anita to get married with her brother Vikram (Tej Sapru), so that it would be easy for her to claim Anita&apos;s property. Kumar soon plans to buy a grand Haveli (yes the same Haveli) from Rana Sahab (Pinchoo Kapoor), who wants to sell it out. Kumar goes to the Haveli, but soon discovers that the Haveli is haunted. His belief is further strengthened when he finds Rana&apos;s corpse. Kumar tries to escape, but his efforts go in vain and he dies a gruesome death.\n\nA few days later, Anita and her friends go to the Haveli to spend their break. Sunil follows Anita too but things turn badly when a stalking Vikram and his henchmen also land up at the Haveli. Vikram soon gets an opportunity and strikes Sunil making him unconscious. Sunil is dragged to the basement and is locked inside. When Sunil regains his senses, he hears some groaning noise. He comes to know that the sound is emerging from a caged room under the basement. He is about the unlock the cage when the same old man stops him from doing so. The old man reveals his name as Navin (Narendra Nath) and claims the monster to be his own son, who was hideously deformed when by mistake he and his wife had to stop at the Haveli as his wife was in labor pain and the hospital was far away. The Haveli was home to an evil spirit that possessed the sprog and since then, the old man guards people against this monster. Sunil somehow believes the old man and leaves the monster locked in the cage. The monster is mistakenly released by one of the perpetrators and the Haveli reanimates with foul incidents. Now its up to the lead cast to save themselves from monster, who won&apos;t let anyone escape from his domain.\n\nThe movie lacks constant atmosphere and most of the actors (minus the lead cast) look like rehab retards who pushily play their parts. Ramsays have once again applied the hairy monster formula, the efficacy of which fizzles out in between. The long comedy sequences and torturous parts by Satish Shah and Tina Ghai definitely prevent this to gain the &apos;higly recommended&apos; status. Watch this only if you are a big fan of Deepak Parashar and Amita Nangia. Since this one is not as close to me as Ramsays&apos; other gems like &apos;Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche&apos;, &apos;Sannata&apos;, &apos;Hotel&apos;, &apos;Dahshat&apos; and &apos;Darwaza&apos;, I would give this 5/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Unfortunately I didn&apos;t manage to catch the 2004 Thai original before this American remake premiered at the annual Belgian Horror and Fantasy Festival. I didn&apos;t bother to see it when it initially got released because there already was an overload of Asian Ghost movies at that time and I really couldn&apos;t cope enduring another dull and scare-free imitation of &quot;Ringu&quot;. After seeing the US remake I&apos;m definitely interested in checking out the original sooner or later. The basic idea of restless spirits trying to communicate through photography is remotely original, but the elaboration (at least in this remake) remains somewhat tedious and predictable. Immediately after their marriage, Jane follows her photographer husband Ben to Tokyo where his friends arranged a splendid job for him. Jane, but soon after also Ben, suffers from visions of a deceased girl and all the pictures they make are ruined by ghostly images of this same girl. There&apos;s more than obviously a link between this girl and Ben&apos;s past days as a bachelor, but Jane only gradually learns the truth of what happened exactly. To my knowledge, this is the first and so far only Thai film to be remade by a Japanese director but with American funds and cast members. Talk about an international co-production! Masayuki Ochiai previously directed the incredibly atmospheric and uncanny hospital-horror film &quot;Infection&quot;, so he definitely knows how to build up suspense and terror through suggestion. The main problem here is that the ghostly subject matter is too &quot;soft&quot; and doesn&apos;t lend itself to provide some genuine shock-moments. We&apos;ve all seen too many (Asian) horror movies already in which white-faced spirits spontaneously appear &amp; disappear again, and the mystery is always build up towards a point where the script can&apos;t possibly fulfill the audience&apos;s anticipations anymore. In &quot;Shutter&quot;, you rather quickly figure out that Ben knows than he tells, so you can easily guess each and every plot twist far in advance. There are a very limited number of sets and exterior locations. Why didn&apos;t the film take advantage of the wondrous city of Tokyo, like for example &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; did? Rachael Taylor is certainly a promising actress with a lot of growing potential, so I hope she&apos;ll get offered a couple of better screenplays in the near future. Thus far, she only has horror rubbish like &quot;See No Evil&quot; and &quot;Man-Thing&quot; on her repertoire and those things won&apos;t get her noticed. Neither will &quot;Shutter&quot;, for that matter.",

A family with intentions to renew their life, move to a beautiful mansion. Unfortunately for them, they buy the possessed clock and that&apos;s when things start to get horrible.\n\nThis is probably the second best sequel in the franchise, following &quot;The Possession&quot;, a sinister sequel. &quot;It&apos;s About Time&quot; obviously centers on the possession topic and has the occasional poltergeist scenes provoked by the clock&apos;s evil glow.\n\nThis movie scared me when I first rented it (I was 8 or 9) because it has a dark, creepy atmosphere. The mansion is scary enough for a movie like this. The f/x are below average but it&apos;s normal for a direct to video sequel.\n\nIf you are a fan of haunted house or possession flicks, this is a very good option that exploits the greatness of direct to video.",

A group of teenagers go sailing in search for a long lost brother and gets shipwrecked on an island. The island inhabitants are a band of people called the Red Bamboo, who are secretly making nuclear bombs in order to conquer the world. Islanders from Infant Island were kidnapped as slaves and the teenagers try to do everything they can to save the islanders and stop the terrorists. To add to the excitement, who would have guessed Godzilla would be seen sleeping in a cave on the island and that an over-sized Shrimp (Lobster or Crab in some reviews) is supposed to be guarding the island? A lot of humor in this movie, especially the lines &quot;I thought you studied science?&quot; with an answer &quot;But I didn&apos;t pass the first year, one thing&apos;s for sure.&quot;\n\nA pretty native girl, played by Kumi Mizuno, is attracted by Godzilla, who gave a little love relationship to her-a love relationship more associated with King Kong (since the story of this movie was originally written for King Kong). Masaru Sato&apos;s music score is catchy and Jun Fukuda did a great directing job. Shinichi Sekizawa gave us an exciting story and Eiji Tsuburaya gave us cool special effects. And, Mothra has a cameo in this movie and her tiny twin priestesses also made an appearance. \n\nOverall, it is a unique and exciting Godzilla entry with plenty of monster appearances and action, which is a plus! \n\nGrade A",

      "reviewBody": "51 years after the release of &quot;THE ALIVE AND THE DEAD&quot;, I&apos;ve finally watched that incredible masterpiece. The movie is as relevant now as it was back in 1964. The movie tells the story of a man, a good man, in the long, infinite, brutal, heroic year of 1941 - the first year of the darkest period in history. The director did an amazing job - the movie is visually astonishing, many of the frames could be, as they are, framed and pinned to a wall. The actors are some of USSR&apos;s best - each one does his role in the best possible way, truly amazing. Most of the actors playing soldiers in this movie are actual World War II veterans. In some scenes, the eyes tell more than words could ever tell. The dialogues are breathtaking and truthful. The movie presents the true horror of this war and the UNBEARABLE weight on the shoulders of the Red Army soldiers. They fought in rain, in snow, in mud, they went through ice and fire. They kept on fighting while being burned alive in tanks, airplanes, ships and trenches. They heroically fought for every hill, for every village, for every station, for every city - for every piece of their land occupied by the most ruthless enemy in human history. They fought the Germans while knowing that their wives and families are at great danger - maybe already tortured and dead or maybe also fighting on the fronts of this forsaken war. The movie perfectly represents that the chances to survive were so incredibly small that each man understood that every day, every minute could be the last. Still - they had hope, still they kept on fighting, still THEY WON THIS WAR. But in this masterpiece, the victory is still very far - this is only 1941.. the war had just begun. With no doubt - 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Director Jerzy Skolimowski has become the foremost cinematic chronicler of the politics of exile for expatriates from Poland, chiefly those living in England, and this author of the screenplay for Roman Polanski&apos;s marvelous KNIFE IN THE WATER has additionally developed a highly kinetic directoral style that visually dashes every which way.  In this feature, Skolimowski exploits a favourite gambit, unresolved blending of fantasy with reality, while also fashioning a strongly political theme, to demonstrate how an encounter with vendibility can convert idealism into hypocrisy and dispassion.  Michael York portrays Alex Rodak, a theatre director exiled in London, with his wife and two sons, where he hopes to emulate the aesthetic and commercial success that he attained upon the Continent, notably in France, despite financial deficiencies that are growing apace.  He is relying upon a benefit show, that he will be staging in a West End theatre, to create a large base of support for a dissident Polish subculture opposed to a repressive Warsaw regime that has become reliant upon imposition of martial law, but his increasing need for funding generates strain between Alex and his family, in particular with his oldest son Adam, played by Michael Lyndon.  Respective cultural and identity crises plaguing Alex and Adam have become correlative, since the younger Rodak resents his father&apos;s dependence upon capital in order to stage what is planned as an abstract drama because Adam believes that Poland would welcome more a diaspora of patriots.  Sadly, the time in which this review may be read is about equal to the amount of comprehensible narrative offered in this production, due to an extraordinary engulfment of meaning by Skolimowski who tenders a perpetual gathering of imagery, certainly never dull in itself but having an exhaustive effect upon a viewer by reason of an unduly complex structure whereby it becomes virtually impossible to fathom precisely what might be occurring.  No character as presented displays virtue, with but Jane Asher&apos;s role with her single scene seeming to be clearly defined, probably as a result of its linear nature; first-class work with the camera by Mike Fash in addition to creative editing and sound design by Barrie Vince are insufficient to offset a nearly complete reliance upon form over substance.",

The action was great, the lines were memorable and the predator was a beast.\n\n&quot;Predator&quot; was a fresh addition to the action movie genre. No fighting gangs, or terrorists, or enemy nations--this was the toughest of the extraterrestrials versus the toughest on Earth. Man they don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore.",

The build-up before the moments that made you jump were great, and although I was fully anticipating what was to come I still jumped several times. The plot was decent and I appreciated how the characters were written. The acting was surprisingly good for a low-budget film, I was definitely impressed by that. The apex of the film was very intense and dramatic, if slightly cheesy. The only thing that really bothered me was the very, very cliché ending. I felt as though I&apos;ve seen that very ending 10 other times in various other movies, it has been so over-done that it will ruin an entire movie for me. But other than the very end, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and would definitely recommend it!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Princesas&quot; is one of them. After seeing Fernando León de Aranoa&apos;s wonderful film &quot;Los Lunes al Sol&quot; (qv), I was hungry for more. I am a great lover of cinema which has either been taken from live theatre or which delve into the realness of the human condition, of human feelings, which explore the depths of what makes people tick, of what makes people think, feel, love, hate, of what makes people on celluloid be real live living people with character and personality and deep feelings. In this aspect &quot;Princesas&quot; is a beautiful, moving, thoughtful piece which deserves great accolade. I left the cinema with very very deep feelings running through my heart and mind, such that I missed the bus-stop, and in the end walked all the way home - about three kilometres!\n\nWithout any doubt, the young Spanish directors Amenábar and León de Aranoa are now well above the more famous Almodóvar. &quot;Princesas&quot; is about prostitutes. Well, forget that: it is about two beautiful people who find themselves working the streets - and the mobile (cell) phone - to get clients. But it is also about friendship, love between two women who have had to drop out into the seamier world of the big cities - in this case, Madrid.\n\nLeón de Aranoa treats the subject matter with such poignant delicacy, with such understanding sensitivity, with such superb and tasteful exquisiteness, that towards the end of the film more than one little tear dropped from my eyes. And that does not often happen.\n\nCandela Peña, (Todo sobre mi madre, qv) (Te doy mis ojos, qv), and Micaela Nevárez in her first film, offer us superb readings of their characters; both are superb; both won my heart. The chemistry between these two young women - Spanish and Dominican - was so magnificent, you would swear they had lived all their lives together. They had me feeling for them, for their situation, for their loves, and desires, and hopes, and Zulema wanting to get back to her child in the Dominican Republic. \n\nThe music by Manu Chao and Gato Pérez was at times a little over strident, but befitting the telling of the story. (There are also other pieces of music not yet mentioned in IMDb).\n\nRamiro Civita&apos;s photography, especially in the facial close-ups is astounding, bringing out the best of the actresses feelings, anguish, torments. Superb work, though some scenes with hand-held camera were at times chaotic. Nevertheless, I pass over this.\n\nThe same as in &quot;Te doy Mis Ojos&quot;(qv) we have here an important sociological document in the form of a film with a story to tell. Women find themselves in bad situations directly due to men&apos;s vain and stupid attempts at being superior over them. Men fail miserably; as I have said in &quot;Te doy mis ojos&quot;: this film makes me feel ashamed of being a man. So does &quot;Princesas&quot;. A beautiful, warm, tender, hard story, so wonderfully told. \n\nI shall see this film again before it is taken off from the local multi -cinemas, and will buy the DVD as soon as it is in the shops.\n\nHere is another film to add to the best six Spanish films of all times:\n\nEl Sur \n\nLos Santos Inocentes \n\nMar Adentro \n\nPrincesas \n\nTe doy Mis Ojos \n\nA los que Aman (all commented on in IMDb)",

She recovered but lost her memories after some dangerous brain surgery. Now her birthday is coming up again.\n\nThere is a lot to like in this B-horror movie. The possibility of Virginia doing the killing is quite compelling. The kills are competent without being ridiculous. This is more of a serial killer movie than a slasher splatter horror. And I like the reveal of what happened in the previous birthday. Everything is working toward a very good B-horror. But then the ending pulls a Scooby Doo. It is really unacceptable to stupid it up like that.\n\nAlso Melissa Sue Anderson best known for &apos;Little House on the Prairie&apos; doesn&apos;t have enough screen presence. She needs to own this movie, but mostly she remains the shy quiet girl in the background. The camera really needs to follow her more.",

Herbert Marshall is all right, he played against her before in &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; four years earlier, he was a jealous husband even there, but that was Josef con Sternberg, while Ernst Lubitsch is a completely different thing, although both are Viennese, and Marlene Dietrich is German. Melvyn Douglas is the tricky thing here. He makes a perfectly abominable offensive character insisting on constantly importuning on her, and you can&apos;t understand how she can tolerate it, but Marlene is Marlene, always superior to any critical situation, and also here she finally provides a solution, but not without the clever psychological empathy with her on the part of Herbert Marshall. Both Melvyn and Herbert appear, however, as perfect dummies at her side, while she makes the entire film worth while and watching. It&apos;s very European, while poor Melvyn keeps blundering on without noticing anything of the subtleties going on. She enters as a mystery of an intrigue, but when she has solved the knot she is already gone.",

Kurt feels the hatred and the fear of his father Count Menliff (Dean Ardow) and the servant Giorgia (Harriet White), who blames him for seducing and killing her daughter, and indifference from his cousin Katia (Isli Oberon). On the next afternoon, the sadistic Kurt meets Nevenka riding a horse alone on the beach and whips the masochistic woman and makes love with her. Late night, Nevenka is missing and everybody is seeking her while Kurt is stabbed in the neck with the same dagger that Giorgia&apos;s daughter was murdered. On the next days, the members of the family suspects of each other while Nevenka is haunted by the ghost of Kurt.\n\n&quot;The Whip and the Body&quot; is a stylish and one of the best features of Mario Bava that uses a magnificent cinematography, lighting and shadows and a classy soundtrack. The acting is great and the only problem is that the Ámerican DVD is awfully dubbed in English, without the synchrony of the movements of the lips with the speech. However, I have just watched this movie again in a Brazilian DVD spoken in Italian. The truth about the supernatural story is not difficult to be guessed what is happening by an attentive viewer. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Chicote e o Corpo&quot; (&quot;The Whip and the Body&quot;)\n\nNote: On 01 October 2014 I saw this movie again.",

      "reviewBody": "Here we have a film about a gang of five larcenists and swindlers who carry off various enrichment schemes under the leadership of &quot;El Jefe,&quot; The Chief. The film opens as they are all at the police station under arrest. They nudge each other as they await interrogation, secure in the knowledge that as soon as El Jefe arrives, he will get them all off somehow. Naturally this film could not have been made during the Peron years, but just 3 years after his fall, here it is. The script is by David Vinas, an leftist anti-Peronist novelist. At one point in the film a woman asks El Jefe how he is able to command the unquestioning allegiance of his gang. He replies: &quot;I take care of them. I snap my fingers, and they are at my beck and call. You have to study them, know their likes &amp; dislikes, their little quirks, their resentments, and what they hope for. I give to them, and they give to me. And they end up wanting just what I want.&quot; We do not learn much about Peronism from this film, but we learn a lot about how Peron&apos;s detractors regarded him.",

      "reviewBody": "If it were only for the splendid and breathtaking scenery i would still recommend this movie. However this film also delivers on the emotional level and follows a journey of transformation as beautiful as the visual aspects.\n\n A single father apts for a change after losing his wife by moving to Alaska with his two children to become a bush pilot. His son is resentful at best, ungrateful, and unappreciative of the vast and stunning riches Alaska has to offer. When their father&apos;s plane goes down and rescue efforts fail, they begin a spiritual journey that will forever change their lives. The son, Shawn, played by Vincent Karthieser, soon comes to terms with the death of his mother, the love for his father, and the respect and appreciation for Alaska. Thora Birch, an actress with a promising future, provides the level-headed and sensible approach to the journey in contrast to her brother&apos;s cockiness and arrogance which provides for great chemistry between the two.\n\nAlong with the natural beauty and landscapes just about every other aspect associated with Alaska is present from: poaching, bushpilots, kayaking, rustic cabins, rock climbing,, moutaineering, camping, and the northern lights along with Cubby, a baby polar bear who tags along and even provides for some tear jerking moments and light hearted humor.\n\nOverall this is a great movie for the entire family or for one with a fascination with the wonders and beauty of the last frontier. It truly evokes a sense of appreciation delivered in a manner without the concept of strong language, violence, and nudity, the three marketing schemes of the industry. It is a fantastic adventure, with great camera angles, stunning visuals and a powerful message. Very well done IMHO."

      "reviewBody": "How could you give this movie one star? The dialogue is very silly and the acting is goofball central, but you can&apos;t say the plot doesn&apos;t make any sense: the original 80s version called &apos;The Warriors&apos; is widely considered a classic. This movie is goofy, but it&apos;s way more fun than it should be and the two WWE stars detract from the story only to the same degree The Rock used to when he was busting skulls. Van Damme&apos;s younger brother (in name only) is a bonafied action star, and I hope he continues to make movies. \n\nFor seekers of unintentional comedy this is a gem. Find it and give it a shot. For low-budget action aficionados this will be a great addition as it has an independent feel with an above average production value. For people who only watch Eisenstein films ... well, you probably won&apos;t be on this page anyways. Happy viewing!\n\nRating: 22/40",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Csak egy kislány van a világon&quot; (roughly &quot;The Only Girl There is in the World&quot;) is sometimes referred to as the first Hungarian sound film, but in truth it is a part-talkie. Nevertheless, it has a superb, Romany-styled music score by Károly Stephanides that is nothing like what would have been done had this film only come down to us as a silent, and a contemporary soundtrack had been made for it. It survives only in a Serbian version cut down from its original length by 22 minutes, and the one I saw was missing another 14; the continuity was especially choppy in the last chapter. But it still told the tale: Two former POWs, Gyõrgy (Pál Jávo) and Miklós (Gusztáv Vándory), return on foot to their native town and are greeted by their families. Gyõrgy falls in love with Katinka (Marta Eggerth), a lovely local girl that Miklós already had deep feelings for. At a celebration later that day, Gyõrgy and Katinka become engaged. Gyõrgy travels by train to the city where he gets entangled with a vamp (Mercedes Zombory), and when he returns to the village the vamp is in tow, leading to all kinds of complications of the heart.\n\n&quot;Csak egy kislány van a világon&quot; is mainly notable as it represents the film debut of Hungarian actress Marta Eggerth, who would soon become the top star of Central European operetta films and musicals; Katinka is her only non-speaking part. Eggerth is radiantly beautiful throughout and demonstrates dramatic ability far beyond the norm for a 17-year old actress. Mercedes Zombary, in her only film role, is alluring, appropriately sexy and uncaring as the &quot;other woman,&quot; and the two male leads handle their roles adequately if a little melodramatically. However, director Béla Gaál gets the most out of meager resources and makes what may have been a great picture here -- &quot;may have been&quot; as so much of it is missing. There are Russian-styled montage sequences that are ambitious and visually striking, and the overall feel of the film is rather like the style of MGM in the late silent period, but with natural settings in place of MGM&apos;s typical, studio-bound artificiality. The sense of Hungarian-ness in the film is palpable, with the bows of fiddles darting across the screen, the rhythmic pace of Gypsy music wrapping around the action and the mixture of modern and traditional dress. Despite some slow passages and ellipses in the story caused by missing footage, &quot;Csak egy kislány van a világon&quot; is an inspired effort with some genuinely great things in it. Director Gaál would go, with considerable success, into comedies in the 1930s, but would end his days, regrettably, in either the Dachau Concentration Camp or at the hands of Nazis on a Budapest street, depending on which account one accepts.",

      "reviewBody": "There are some lines at the beginning of the movie (after the &quot;initial&quot; shock scene that is), that try to convince that this movie has a real background. Of course as with many other horror movies, this does not stay in our reality and has quite some major flaws in it&apos;s story telling. You just get enough background information on some of the guys (their relationship to each other), to know who is who. Beyond that there is nothing to really distinguish them (apart from the character that Breckin Meyers portrays, but never really achieves anything with, except from his first scenes).\n\nActually, if you didn&apos;t know Breckin Meyer (which could be the case), you might be excused to not even really notice him and be completely irritated by his action(s) later as the movie progresses.\n\nStorytelling and character aren&apos;t really the backbones of this movie, but it has some nice/decent horror moments and some pretty good gore effects. Unfortunately some scenes are edited/shot as if the cameraman/editor had been under &quot;influence&quot;. I&apos;m not a big fan of the &quot;shake the camera&quot; and it will look frightening theory. Others might be, not me though.\n\nDecent, but nothing you really need to watch, unless you are into this sort of genre pictures (and even then there are so many other movies out there)",

      "reviewBody": "Once again Antonio Banderas shows us he can act well. I mark the film 9 out of 10, especially given the risks run by all those involved in making this film on site, in Jerusalem. I am staggered that the film could be made in Jerusalem at all, with all the differing Christian, Jewish and Palestinian groups and splinter groups so well depicted, if fictionalised in their representation. The violent scenes may not drip the blood of a Tarantino movie but it is enough to convey the &quot;to the death&quot; intolerance of each other that so shamefully characterise so many of these groups and splinter groups today. The actors and the script show the intensity of so many who refuse to acknowledge/accept the rights of the others - to their differing faith, or even to exist. The film brilliantly reminds us of how these groups and splinter groups lose sight of the essential truth of their own faith/belief system in their violent intolerance of the other. This is the key to facing the stark reality of the intractability of the various players in the Middle East which the film so well depicts. Especially it underlines these groups and splinter groups&apos; willingness to misuse/abuse: the innocent trying simply to live peacefully with their families; the combatants&apos; own faith/followers; as well as that of those they oppose. The tragedy of the Middle East is that, I believe, the same fate would befall the ancient prophets of these faiths, were they alive today, as befell them centuries/millennia ago. The religiously-intolerant attacks by some on this film simply demonstrate how correct this belief is. The actors, film director and all those others involved in making this film deserve congratulations for their courage in making it on site - despite the risks to themselves from the intolerant.\n\nGreyollie, Canberra, Australia."

      "reviewBody": "Bottom line, whether you love or hate &quot;Kansas City&quot; will depend on your reaction to Jennifer Jason Leigh&apos;s performance. Leigh&apos;s character Blondie anchors the story as a desperate wife trying to save her husband from the gangsters he tried to rob. Leigh looks great in this role, she is fit and trim which makes her face cuter and her character more fragile looking. The contrast between her almost angelic appearance and her tough persona is intentional because the toughness is an affectation, qualities she has adopted because she loves her husband and they are a turn-on for him. \n\nHer&apos;s is the key performance of the film, the twist is her emulation of Kansas City native Jean Harlow (&quot;The Public Enemy&quot; and &quot;Girl from Missoui&quot;). Watch Harlow in &quot;Red Headed Woman&quot; and you will see the incredible physical resemblance between the two actresses. Personally I found it both touching and humorous; her character worthy of the brave heroine hall of fame. But it is almost a caricature and some viewer will be put off by this tiny woman talking so tough.\n\nAs in &quot;Nashville&quot;, there are great songs (but jazz rather than country) throughout the film. It is important to realize that &quot;Blondie&apos;s&quot; behavior is intended to mirror the &quot;cutting contests&quot; between the jazz musicians on-stage at the club. Just as the musicians borrow from one another and weave each others stuff into what they are improvising, &quot;Blondie&quot; borrows from the movies and weaves Harlow&apos;s tough girl phrases and expressions into her conversation.\n\nLeigh and Miranda Richardson spend most of the film in each other&apos;s company. Although Richardson&apos;s character is doped up on laudanum (tincture of opium) most of the time, you get the idea that she is taking in a lot more of the situation than she is letting on. There is almost a &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; quality to their relationship, in part because Leigh doing Harlow ends up sounding a lot like Geena Davis doing Geena Davis. The two women are polar opposites in the way they react to the desperation in their lives; one has lost all restraint, the other has lost everything but restraint.\n\nRichardson&apos;s character is unexpectedly touching. An emotional bond is subtly forged between the two women as the film proceeds, with Richarson gradually becoming totally protective of her kidnapper. The ending is shocking but you understand the motivation, then looking back you pick up on the various foreshadowing devices that Altman placed throughout the film. He goes out with a bass duet of Duke Ellington&apos;s &quot;Solitude&quot; performed by Ron Carter and Christian McBride.\n\nLike many films with downbeat endings, &quot;Kansas City&quot; is destined to be more appreciated 25 years after its release.",

They have peacefully settled in Arizona, where they manage to make such a good harvest they can start selling fruit. This is a thorn in the side of local merchants who quickly find a corrupt army officer named Burton to start some trouble, causing the native Americans to leave their reservation. Burton keeps an eye on Ulzana&apos;s beautiful Mexican wife Leona (Renate Blume) to make things more complicated. Yes, you guess right: Ulzana doesn&apos;t find that funny ;-). Shot in Uzbekistan (!), this is a western produced 1973 by the DEFA which had gained several years of experience with westerns by then. And it shows. &quot;Ulzana&quot; is a real joy with all ingredients for 90 entertaining minutes. I&apos;d like to recommend it also to those among you who know the kind of westerns shot in Spain, but haven&apos;t checked out East German productions before.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a funny experience when a film evokes déjà vu, only to realize the source of the déjà vu is, itself, intended to itself incite déjà vu. Picture this: a miserable storm sweeps a carload of normal people, as earnest as they are bedraggled, into taking refuge at a spooky old manor, only to be besieged and coveted by the prurient, camp Gothic inmates. But don&apos;t do the Time Warp again just yet: at the core of this Russian Doll of horror, pastiche, and dark humour lurks James Whale&apos;s oft-overlooked but seldom forgotten mini- masterpiece – The Old Dark House. As Poe-faced as if the script had been quoth by the Raven itself, Whale&apos;s film is, if not the granddaddy of most horror clichés, then at least the wry, drunken great-uncle. And, weathered as it is, time has been kind to this one, making The Old Dark House a creepy, clever, and sordidly amusing addition to the pantheon of horror classics. Singing not included; pelvic thrusting barely omitted. \n\nIf nothing else, The Old Dark House makes for a fascinating transitional tonal touch-point for Whale, one of the defining masters of classical horror. The film isn&apos;t as overtly satirical and camp as Whale&apos;s later monster mash-terpieces, The Invisible Man and, especially, Bride of Frankenstein, but it certainly shows him creeping in that direction, with a persistent snicker of irreverent naughtiness under its raspy breath. This isn&apos;t to say the film is an outright farce - indeed, Whale runs the gamut of thematic leitmotifs that would proceed to become preoccupations for decades of horror to follow: dogmatic religion, lurid sexuality, class discrepancies, and shunned, disabled family members. Yet, his film crackles with an invigorating, nervy energy, and his characters banter with zingy, pre-screwball fury, with several double-entendres pushing the boundaries of Hays Code knuckle-rapping with cheeky aplomb (maybe Whale assumed American censors wouldn&apos;t understand them through the Welsh accents?). \n\nHis setup is certainly foreboding enough, with the harried car ride prelude across flooding, lightning-scarred Welsh countryside a perfectly ominous amuse-bouche for the sinister, Gothic castle theatrics to come. Whale&apos;s flair for atmospheric mise-en-scène is superb, peppering the film with marvelously spooky flourishes and Expressionist lighting keeping the audience biting their nails throughout (one bit, where a woman makes shadow puppets on the wall with her hands, only to have a dark figure emerge from the shadow, is a jump scare for the ages). But Whale bides his time, keeping his pacing cunningly slow and allowing his film to froth at the mouth with looming tension.\n\nWhale&apos;s film is also remarkable for the unprecedented access the audience is given to his cabal of characters. Too many horror films introduce characters as disposable (and disposed of) props, but Whale treats the first half of his potboiler like a theatre piece, as the growing crowd of storm refugees and reluctant hosts meet, and poke hopes, dreams, prejudices, and – mostly – fears out of each other. Whale&apos;s ensemble rises to the challenge, delivering genuinely well-crafted and compelling characters, particularly the suave, sharp-tongued Melvyn Douglas, the tough but chipper Lilian Bond, and, especially, Charles Laughton, who gives a remarkably heartfelt performance, his effete bluster whisking away to reveal a man plagued by terrible loneliness underneath. His monologue, revealing his bitter turn to capitalism as a means of finding purpose and escaping past tragedy, is strangely tragic and surprisingly moving amidst the film&apos;s tongue-in-cheek tone, and a curious counterpoint to Depression-era cinema&apos;s usual propensity for portraying the super-rich as vacuous twits. Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore deliver masterclasses of brooding as the manor&apos;s sister tenants, while title star Boris Karloff is genuinely terrifying, his performance so much more affecting than the mere rage-ravaged riff on his Frankenstein lumbering and grunting you&apos;d initially expect. Finally, Brember Wills gives a performance so deft and daringly over-the-top that he turns horror conventions on their head even while pushing new boundaries of skin-crawling, especially for the 1930s. \n\nWhale&apos;s quieter companion piece to his more famous forays into the macabre may tip the cap more at Hitchcock than Mary Shelley, but ably continues his macro theme of humans being far more terrifying than any conventional &apos;monsters.&apos; The Old Dark House may be humbler in scope, and somewhat more tonally imbalanced than some of its cohort of horror classics (including a swooning romantic subplot that&apos;s altogether too saccharine and sincere to play amidst its sardonic surroundings). Still, at a mere 72 minutes, the film is as concise and sardonically sinister as it is creepy, and still a slice of spine-tingling fun for an eerie, rainy night. \n\n-8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Winning awards and nominations at Cannes, Sweet Sixteen continues director Ken Loach&apos;s devotion to social awareness. After using film that directly affected legislative reform (Cathy Come Home) in 1965, his work has spanned the globe and a wide variety of social ills and with very varying fortunes in marketability. Sweet Sixteen looks at adolescent delinquency and the difficulties faced by youths who try desperately to escape the downward spiral that ruins their lives forever. The script, in broad Scots dialect, has an urgency and reality to it. The young actors come mostly from the deprived areas of Western Scotland where the film is set, many of them first-timers and of an age where they would not legally be admitted to the film. The scriptwriter bitterly attacked the BBFC over its 18&apos; certificate decision, which was based mostly on the aggressive use of strong language. Meanwhile, English distributors looked at the use of subtitles to help adults south of the border cope.\n\nThe story follows 15-year old Liam (played by 17-yr old football player Martin Compston) as a youth who is determined to have a normal family life once his mother gets out of prison. The drug-dealing boyfriend of his mother and his empty-headed companion Pinball&apos;, do little to make his quest easier. He opts for means to an end&apos;  a simple enough mistake we feel for a young boy in his circumstances. The consequences, of course, are told with shocking realism. Will the film have the sort of impact that Cathy Come Home&apos; had on homeless laws, and mean more attention is given to real support for youths in disadvantaged areas, rather than simply throwing money at the unwinnable war against drug dealing? The long list of agencies thanked in the closing credits shows how the people in the know pin their hopes on Loach  one of Britain&apos;s finest and conscience-filled directors  and one of our most ignored.",

      "reviewBody": "After viewing this film for the first time (and with an open mind), I feel the need to defend it against the general naysayers who condemn it, claiming that it is nothing but a rip-off.  Unfortunately, this film has just about been buried by several bad reviews, and the fact that &quot;E.T.&quot; was released just prior to this film, didn&apos;t help it, either.\n\nThe fact is, it&apos;s nearly 20 years down the line, and people are still comparing it to &quot;E.T.&quot;.  I certainly don&apos;t feel that this is a rip-off of &quot;E.T.&quot;, nor do I feel that it bears much resemblance.  It may be true that this film was made with the intent to cash in on the alien/science-fiction trend of that period, but then again, when doesn&apos;t that happen in Hollywood? If we are going to compare films about extra-terrestrials, then this one ranks more closely to Steven Spielberg&apos;s earlier accomplishment, &quot;CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND&quot;.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this film.  Robert Carradine and Cherrie Currie (of The Runaways fame) turn in some solid performances, which rise above most films of this caliber.  Keenan Wynn, reprising his usual stubborn old man role, is always worth watching.  Tangerine Dream provides the music for the film, and as usual, their score is especially effective, and works best in the most critical areas.\n\nOne has to appreciate the intelligence that the film has, which clearly indicates that this was not just another &quot;hatchet-job&quot; rushed effort, that some would suspect.\n\nThe end result is, by no means, tremendous.  But, this film is extremely underrated, and is at the very least, worthwhile entertainment.\n\nIf you get a chance, give it a shot.",

A nice bonus is that one really gets a feeling for the borderland between Denmark and Germany. The sea is like a just sometimes visible character that is always present. \n\nIt anyhow seems there is a lot going on behind the images. Something mysterious, something magic, something unseen and unheard. So it fits that a hearing aid is placed in the centre of the film. I am very thankful for that film.

The one moment of any interest to Straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that - It&apos;s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the Michael Dudikoff B-Movies I&apos;ve endured\n\n1/10",

      "reviewBody": "This film pulls back the curtain to reveal a glimpse of what `celebrity&apos; means when the cameras aren&apos;t rolling and the stage is dark.  What begins as a celebration of sorts becomes a character study that examines the lifestyle of the self-absorbed and those driven by ego, and we get to see the people behind the `fame.&apos;  And while on one hand `The Anniversary Party,&apos; written and directed by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh, appears at first to be the kind of party you could find at anyone&apos;s house at any time in any place, subtle differences begin to surface that separates it from what could be considered the `norm.&apos;  Because beyond certain corporate similarities, the entertainment industry is quite unlike any other, and that goes especially for the people who inhabit it.  Sure, actors, writers, directors, etc. are people, just like anyone else, but their particular perceptions and priorities necessarily shift them into a unique position within the landscape of the human condition, wherein they exist amongst their own and for the most part play the game by their own rules.  This is a generalization, of course; not every actor or artist lives in the style depicted in this film, but many do.  In the final analysis, Hollywood is not called `La-La Land&apos; for no reason, and Cumming and Leigh know it.  Welcome to a world in which anything is acceptable, anything goes, and usually does.\n\nWriter/director Joe Therrian (Cumming) and actress Sally Nash (Leigh) have prepared a party to celebrate their six years together; not that they have actually been `together&apos; the entire time, but according to the actor/artist math, it&apos;s close enough.  Close friends and associates have been invited to share whatever this is with them, as well as a couple of neighbors, Monica and Ryan Rose (Mina Badie, Denis O&apos;Hare), who have certain `issues&apos; with Joe and Sally.  And, much to the chagrin of the `aging&apos; Sally, whose career seems to be on the wane, Joe has invited the hot young up-and-comer in town, Skye Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the party.  As the evening wears on into the early morning hours, true feelings are gradually revealed amid a game of charades (rather, a `production&apos; of charades; these people are forever `on&apos;), as well as the sharing of a certain `product&apos; given as a present to Joe and Sally by Skye.  And so, what began as a celebration, in the cold, hard light of morning just may be remembered as something entirely different.  Welcome to the wonderful world of show biz.\n\nThe daughter of actor Vic Morrow, Jennifer Jason Leigh was born into the business, so to speak; Alan Cumming, on the other hand will have to come up with his own excuse.  But they have collaborated (perhaps `conspired&apos; would be more accurate) to bring to the screen an interesting, thought provoking story that for all intents and purposes seems, at least, as if it could be a composite of actual experiences and people they have known.  Which means they&apos;ve succeeded in delivering a film that has the decided flavor of reality about it, and for the most part it&apos;s extremely engaging, and often riveting drama.  it may be a film that many will have trouble connecting with, though, if only because it is bound to fall outside the realm of personal experience for them.  Most of the issues in this story are simply unfamiliar territory to the greater part of the world&apos;s population, with the exception of those dealing with the more universal themes, like the appreciation of a child&apos;s song, or the irritation of the perpetual barking of a neighbor&apos;s dog.\n\nWhat really sells the project, though, and maintains interest, is the excellent ensemble cast the filmmakers have assembled here, portraying an inordinate number of characters driven by look-at-me! egos, yet each presented within their own unique perspectives and contexts.  At the center of the fray, of course, is Cumming and Leigh, each of whom do a solid job of anchoring the myriad situations and scenarios generated through, by and around them.  Leigh successfully conveys a sense of insecurity consistent with Sally&apos;s current status, and Cumming does a good job of making Joe quite unlikable, affecting as he does the look, attitude and personality born of an overblown and bloated ego.  it&apos;s a portrayal that effectively points up the absolute boorishness that can be found within this community.\n\nPaltrow, meanwhile, perfectly captures the essence of the shallow and relatively clueless ingenue, the vast majority of whom become a flavor of the week before disappearing into the obscurity of Hollywood&apos;s human `outbox.&apos;  While Phoebe Cates, as former actress Sophia Gold, represents the opposite end of the spectrum, a young woman perfectly content with her current role of wife and mother.  And Kevin Kline is convincing as her husband, actor Cal Gold, who though successful is still visited with insecurities and doubt; and his performance is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nAlso turning in performances that stand out from the rest are Mina Badie (Leigh&apos;s real life half-sister) as the neighbor who comes to the party offering conciliatory overtures toward a more `neighborly&apos; relationship; John C. Reilly, as Mac Forsyth, a veteran director struggling with his latest project (the star of which just happens to be Sally Nash); and Peter Sellers look alike Michael Panes, as Sally&apos;s talented friend, Levi.\n\n Rounding out the exceptional cast are Jane Adams (Clair), John Benjamin Hickey (Jerry), Parker Posey (Judy), Jennifer Beals (Gina), Matt Malloy (Sanford) and Owen Kline and Greta Kline (Kevin and Phoebe&apos;s real life children, as Jack and Evie Gold).  A film that is more interesting than entertaining, `The Anniversary Party&apos; nevertheless offers the viewer a chance to vicariously explore and experience Tinsel Town from the dark side of the curtain; some will find it exciting, while others will deem it decidedly unglamorous.  Either way, Cumming and Leigh are to be commended for making it `real.&apos;  It&apos;s the magic of the movies.  7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;3 Ring Circus is probably the least funny of the films that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis made together. As a comedy team, these two were hit and miss in films. This one has so little comedy that it&apos;s only real attribute is the animals and the portrayal of the once great circuses for entertainment. Even then, there are few real circus feats here. The trapeze work of Zsa Zsa Gabor&apos;s Saadia (or her stunt woman double) is almost amateurish compared to the real thing. A number of other movies have some genuine circus performers in them for aerial feats and working with animals from dogs and horses to the big cats and elephants.\n\nAside from the animals, there&apos;s not much to this film. The plot is thin and the antics of Jerry Lewis hardly get a couple of chuckles. The funniest thing in this film is seeing Elsa Lanchester as The Bearded Lady. When Jerry plans to shave her he runs into trouble with the circus manager.\n\nThe plot for this film is thin, and the except for the mostly not funny antics of Lewis, it&apos;s otherwise quite dull - even boring. The closest thing to humor in the dialog is in these two exchanges.\n\nJill Brent, &quot;What do you do, Mr. Nelson?&quot; Pete Nelson, &quot;Uh, I&apos;m ma pretty good machine-gunner and I sing a little.&quot; Jill Brent, &quot;Mmhmm. Then you must&apos;ve seen my ad for a singing machine-gunner.&quot; Jerry Hotchkiss, &quot;Huh, huh, huh, huh.&quot;\n\nPete Nelson, &quot;How come you never married?&quot; Jill Brent, &quot;Isn&apos;t that a rather personal question?&quot; Pete Nelson, &quot;I&apos;m sorry.

      "reviewBody": "A California valley girl named Wanda Saknussemm (Kathy Ireland), desperately searching for a means to make a new start and escape her nerdish tendencies, goes to Africa in search of her absentee archaeologist father following reports he may have fallen into a bottomless pit only for her to stumble and fall down the same hole. She winds up in a bizarre and strange underground city named Atlantis which just might be at the center of the Earth. There she befriends a miner she calls &quot;Gus&quot; and continues searching for her long lost Papa. However those dwelling in the underground city have heard rumors of there being aliens from the surface world hidden amongst them and despite the government&apos;s constant denial that aliens exist on television, they still offer rewards for the capture of anyone who might be thought an &quot;alien&quot; making Wanda a target for many unscrupulous types.\n\nThis is a relatively harmless fantasy time-waster. In fact, the non-discriminating fantasy viewer may actually enjoy this one. This is kind of like a California Valley Girl version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND with a bit of THE WIZARD OF OZ thrown in filtered through a BLADE RUNNER-esquire setting with the train of events playing out rather like SPACEHUNTER but this movie isn&apos;t anywhere near as good as any of those. I have to admit I actually had fun watching this though it&apos;s just so outrageous and outlandish in its approach. The sets too prove surprisingly effective for a low budget movie. Plus I always get a kick out of the state controlled television announcements which prove incredibly transparent in their intent. While this is definitely not for everyone (it stars Kathy Ireland who&apos;s really no actress, borrows most of its plot from other movies and things always feel a little too safe and sure for our leads), there are those who might find enjoyment here although it&apos;s a little tough to explain why exactly. Just the harmless fun of it all I guess.",

I was completely disheartened by this.\n\nIn my opinion, In Time was an original well written and well acted and truly thought provoking production and I loved it. The fact that it subtly questioned our morality and made us question real world issues such as poverty and political stance was just one of the things that made me love this movie.\n\nTo the people who dislike the feature and to those negative reviews which I have read I have a few responses. Firstly, I saw a point about not enough back story into the body clock. The first thought that struck me was really? The movie is not centred around the body clock, and furthermore throughout the film we are told of its uses and get to a fairly good understanding to how it works. Do you not agree that any more back story would waste time and most likely just bore the typical viewer? Finally to those who disliked the acting and script I strongly disagree. I though both Justin and Amanda played there parts very well and there chemistry was as good as any action film I have scene.\n\nI would highly recommend this film to anyone, and suggest if you haven&apos;t already seen it you should definitely make some time if you think you will enjoy this movie.",

Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. \n\nThis movie is unrelentingly grim--&quot;noir&quot; in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine.

      "reviewBody": "ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANDREI ARSENEVICH is just about the best analysis you will find of Andrei Tarkovsky&apos;s film style. It was made by director Chris Marker for the French TV series &quot;Cinema de notre temps&quot; (&quot;Film in Our Time&quot;) and in it, I found a lot to meditate on. Tarkovsky was a filmmaker who wanted to elevate film to the level of the other great arts (literature, painting, and music) and this documentary clearly shows how Tarkovsky did it with his own unique way of filmmaking.\n\nMarker&apos;s film does a pretty good job editing the final days of Tarkovsky&apos;s life, along with how he directed his last film THE SACRIFICE, as well as giving a fine analysis of Tarkovsky&apos;s film style. For instance, Marker compares what he calls the typical camera angle of Hollywood (slightly low, framing people against the sky) with the typical camera angle of Tarkovsky&apos;s films (slightly high, framing people against the ground). He also analyzes the way that fire and water are typical elements seen in nature, as well as the films of the Russian master.\n\nThe film will confuse many who are not familiar with the life and work of film&apos;s greatest mystic, but it will satisfy all those who want to view a superb analysis of a cinematic genius!",

The basic premise of the story line is a good one but as with many low budget Sci-Fi films there are flaws in the telling.\n\nThe biggest flaw is in the title itself. Being as this dog befriends Ally Sheedy&apos;s character and basically snarls at all the men it come across the film probably should have been called &quot;Woman&apos;s Best Friend&quot; or better yet &quot;M.A.X.&quot;.\n\nOther than the title though the movie is basically a good film and you have to get pretty picky to find any real problems with it. It&apos;s not a great movie but it has some good scares, moments of comic relief, and some cool special effects.\n\nI don&apos;t know why this film has gotten such a low over-all rating. I know that IMDb ratings tend to average a bit on the low side but still this movie deserves a lot better than a 4.4. I have given the film a 7 and feel this movie is good enough to add to any one&apos;s DVD library if found at budget prices.\n\nDefinitely worth a rental if you haven&apos;t already seen it.\n\nEB",

      "reviewBody": "One of the most expensive projects of its time - between the 5 million RM of &quot;Münchhausen&quot; and 8,5 million RM of &quot;Kolberg&quot; - this film is worth its reputation. I do understand that it can be watched without subtitles, but having translated this film recently I urge you to find a subtitled version, or you&apos;ll miss most of its fun. The dialog is very snappy and sometimes even funny. But it&apos;s the musical numbers that really are the piece de resistance here, building an enormous Agfacolor alternative reality to the world that was devastated by the War. It&apos;s reported that the orderly Germans occasionally stampeded the fellow citizens trying to get a ticket - such was the enthusiasm as the film opened in the late summer of 1944. Rökk is not only a brilliant, acrobatic dancer and a passable comedienne, but also a good singer, starting the film in low cabaret-like voice and showing off her soubrette soprano towards the end. She always was on the stout side (she probably needed strong muscles to perform her acrobatics), but in this film she really looks good and elegant. Highly enjoyable piece of Nazi film-making without a trace of propaganda.\n\nAfter the war this film (along with many other German musicals) was screened as a &quot;trophy picture&quot; in Moscow and the whole Soviet Union. Ironically, the words of Herr Göbbels became true: German film would march with the German army anywhere in the World. The army didn&apos;t make it, the film did. Even more: the grand finale, really a beautiful piece of film-making, made it to the syllabus of the course in the Soviet Film Institute, where it remained for a long time. In the greatest of all the Russian cult TV serials - The 17 Moments of Spring - there&apos;s a lengthy scene where the protagonist, the Soviet spy in the Nazi Germany, sits his way through this film for the 13th time. The voice over explains that he hated the film but was waiting for the appearance of a secret courier; nevertheless the fact that about 3 minutes of the screen time (eagerly watched in 1971 by about 200 million people) is used, to show one of the dance numbers in the finale, proves that The Girl Of My Dreams had been firmly established in the collective knowledge of the Soviet citizen one way or another.",

She&apos;s also afraid of flying so she stays home while her fiance goes to Paris on business. Things take a turn for the worse when he calls, saying he&apos;s met the woman of his dreams and he&apos;s staying in France.\n\nFrantic to get back her man, she boards a plane. Next to her sits a French thief, beautifully played by Kevin Kline, who has problems of his own, most notably how to smuggle a diamond necklace out of the country.\n\nIt&apos;s a character-driven plot that Cary Grant would have loved - two people who are seemingly so &quot;repelled&quot; by each other but all they need are the right elements to fall in love. I&apos;m generally not a fan of the romantic-comedy, but the French setting sucked me in as did a supporting role played by the always excellent Jean Reno. \n\nAs for the authenticity of Kline&apos;s accent, I had a good friend from France who claimed it was &quot;formidable.&quot; So there.\n\nVery entertaining and worth a watch.\n\nWant more French choices? Try &quot;Frantic&quot; with Harrison Ford, it&apos;s Hitchcockian; &quot;Green Card,&quot; who can resist Depardieu?; and my all-time favorite Meg Ryan film &quot;Addicted to Love.&quot; It&apos;s a great black comedy and it has the sizzlingly sexy Tcheky Karyo. &quot;C&apos;est magnifique!&quot;",

I have seen over 1000 movies but never something like this. It is a really different and brilliant World War 2 film. The originality makes this movie along with a storyline which isn&apos;t easy to figure out how it will end. Fred Robsham does a great job as Heinz, the German soldier and main character. The other actors do a very good job as well. This is a movie you should watch people. Rest in peace Raffaele!",

Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were perfect casting as was Christopher Hewitt (later to be known as TV&apos;s &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;). What&apos;s even more impressive are the various elements of truth that are beneath the histerical if not obsurbed storyline. The current Broadway hit doesn&apos;t compete with this film. The performances are good on stage but not as wonderful as here. Due to long term business problems this film wasn&apos;t released for home video and cable until much later then it should have been. Outright broad comedy and silliness belong in our daily lives and this film offers them very well. EVERYONE should see this film!"

The general&apos;s living head controls the perfectly preserved body of his high priest Xihu (Guillermo Cramer), who comes alive to kill the professors, cutting out their hearts with a sacrificial dagger.\n\nThe killing of the men is extremely repetitive: the head opens its eyes, the &apos;mummy&apos; comes alive, and the victim is killed. This happens several times, and while reasonably creepy the first time, it soon becomes tedious. Meanwhile, the police (led by Mexican horror regular Abel Salazar) fail to solve the case despite finding the still dripping bloody dagger in the hand of Xihu.\n\nIn the finale, which cannot come too soon, Xihu tries to order Marta (lovely Ana Luisa Peluffo), daughter of Prof. Muller (Germán Robles), to kill her father, and when that fails, attempts to control Marta&apos;s fiancé Roberto (Mauricio Garcés). However, when Xihu realises that Roberto and Marta are the reincarnations of Acatl and Aztec priestess Xochiquétzal (gesundheit!), he accepts defeat and turns to dust.\n\nThe best thing about the whole film (apart from sexy Peluffo) is the hilarious spider that crawls out from behind the head (the rubber arachnid clearly being pulled along on a fishing line).\n\n3/10.",

Be it the opus Zapped! or the classic Killer Klowns from Outer Space, I pride myself on bringing to illumination the forgotten masterpieces of cinema. I bark obscure film knowledge. That is why I am praising the likes of one of the top ten most overlooked films of the early 1980s: Super Fuzz aka Super Snooper aka Poliziotto superpiù.\n\nThis comedy, live action, sci-fi/fantasy and action/adventure film even made it to my coveted top 25 Movie Moments list: \n\n19.) The super powers of Officer Dave SpeedDave becomes able to move objects with the mind force, discover mysterious crimes, jump with no problem from a skyscraper and blow a massively huge bubble from one piece of gum to save he and his friends from a sunken ship. Like most heroes, there is a weaknessthe color red. (Super Fuzz, 1980)\n\nThis film was a force on late night HBO during my hazy childhood. It played everyday and night. I recorded it on VHS and watched it religiously along with the above-mentioned Zapped! \n\nSuper Fuzz was a superhero like no other. Behold his powers! He makes all the people in the Orange Bowl (tens of thousands of people!) disappear into the unknown reaches of time and space with but a thought! The physics and theories behind these mind force powers have serious implications and are staggering. I only aspire to have such mind force powers.\n\nI recently acquired a mint condition vinyl recording of the film&apos;s catchy and amazingly plentiful disco theme song &apos;Super Snooper&apos; by The Oceans:\n\n&apos;He&apos;s a super-snooper, Really super-trooper!&apos;\n\nThat Ernest Borgnine made the film even better as Sgt. Willy Dunlop.\n\nIt is mandatory viewing for any serious student of film. &apos;Super, Super!&apos;\n\nCast:\n\nTerence Hill as Dave Speed, Ernest Borgnine as Sgt. Willy Dunlop, Joanne Dru as Rosy Labouche, Marc Lawrence as Torpedo, Julie Gordon as Evelyn\n\nSergio Corbucci directed Super Fuzz."

Even the film&apos;s rhythm is slightly &quot;off&quot;, making it very different from the current rash of Hong Kong &quot;I See Ghost&quot; movies of late. Although the premise is overly familiar by now (Shu Qi plays a woman who can see ghosts -- but only with her left eye!), the movie works as an effective human drama (especially the lead&apos;s relationship with his brother and father) and as a quirky comedy (the movie is oftentimes very funny). As a ghost story, it falters badly, and there&apos;s a twist at the end that, if you weren&apos;t asleep during the previous 90 minutes, you can see coming about 50 miles away.\n\nOne other thing: VISIBLE SECRET has almost no scares in it. There are some attempts at mood and atmosphere, but for the most part the laughs and over-the-top hilarity overcomes the thrills and chills, which comes across as more mundane requisite than anything the filmmakers were interested in putting into their movie.\n\n7 out of 10\n\n(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the film, and reviews of other movies in this genre)",

(Arguably, with the initial premise of a man surviving being hanged, I should have stopped taking things literally almost straight away).\n\nIt has an accessible first half that does give way to a more disturbing and confounding second half, but it&apos;s a journey well worth taking if the premise sounds interesting to you.",

As expected and as needed, the photography is magical, and there are a couple of moments when the frogs, amphibians and insects elicit a laugh or two, especially the frogs. The story is that of the world of a tiny pond, tiny to many eyes but vast and peopled with innumerable characters to the eyes of a tiny boy, the pond that will tell him how no one&apos;s ever lonely. The ending of the film is beautiful, and it lends impact to the story even if threadbare it is. The ending brings to mind Dostoyevsky&apos;s and Giono&apos;s beliefs, of how a seed dropped may bear fruit and hence how dropping of a seed is important rather than thinking whether it will yield fruit or not. The pond and its world was abandoned by humanity, but was the richest treasure for a little boy.",

It is well scripted, the parts fit together seamlessly and logically, and everything is justly proportioned--that is, everything&apos;s in good balance.\n\nAnd the best part of it is that the acting is never overdone. The main characters are really human and believable, and Barret Oliver&apos;s acting is totally natural and spontaneous.\n\nSo even though one has to suspend disbelief in the science fiction impossibility of the story (a mere machine could never actually become a human brain), it&apos;s really worth doing so, just for the fun of it. \n\nJust accept the basic premise of the plot for the sake of the story, and then relax and enjoy a heart-warming display of what are real human values in a world where these are sometimes sadly lacking, and a thought-provoking consideration of what it means to be &apos;a real person.&apos;",

I loved their Wind in the Willows and Peter Pan, but I wasn&apos;t sure what to make of their Alice in Wonderland. Granted it&apos;s better than the versions of The Three Musketeers, The Old Curiosity Shop and Prisoner of Zenda, but something was lacking here. I did like the theme song, it does repeat itself but it is a pleasant and catchy tune. The characters are more colourful and engaging than the Jetlag version especially Mad Hatter and Queen of Hearts, Alice herself is much less bland and while odd(purposefully) the Cheshire Cat is fun also. The animation is not too bad, while the character designs are on the scratchy side the backgrounds are quite colourful. The rest of the music aside from the song though is rather screechy and over-bearing, while the recording of the voices is I agree rather muted, which probably accounts for why some of the vocal work seemed uninterested. The writing doesn&apos;t quite give an over-simplified feeling like the Jetlag version did, but still feels as though it is lacking in thoughtfulness and wit. The story is more faithful in spirit to Jetlag&apos;s and while the dream-like feel is there, the oddball nature and the nuances of the story(which I have always considered one of the all-time greats) aren&apos;t quite. All in all, not bad as such but I am not sure whether I kind of like it or dislike it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; is a wonderful film which works on at least two levels: a romance and a social commentary. Unlike most romances, it manages to be touching without being melodramatic, and unlike most social commentaries, it subtly makes its points without manipulation or a hidden agenda.\n\nIt is the story of how Selina, a blind girl who is verbally and sometimes physically abused by her mother, discovers her independence with the help of a young, black professional, Gordon. Selina&apos;s entire life has been spent alone and indoors. She has not learned how to read Braille or how to get around on her own. She basically does not know how to live independently. She meets Gordon in the park one day, and he essentially begins to teach her how to live. A warm and trusting friendship develops. The obvious complication from their relationship is the fact that Selina&apos;s mother is a racist, and Selina does not know that Gordon is black.\n\nBoth characters are wonderful: Gordon is cautious but intrigued, knowing he is walking on dangerous ground. Selina is comically naive and eager with an unbreakable spirit. \n\nIf you get a chance, watch this movie! It is inspiring and is one of those rare films that actually makes you think."

      "reviewBody": "The movie Evita, starring Madonna, Antonio Banderas and Johnathan Pryce is a musical account of the life of Eva Peron. An adaptation of the original rock opera by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the film is told as a flash back with the narrator, Antonio Banderas as Che, recounting the events that have lead to the opening scene: the announcement of Evita&apos;s death.\n\nEvita, played by Madonna, was born into poverty in rural Argentina. She was able to climb the social ladder through her numerous male relationships and acting career. Eventually she marries Juan Peron, played by Jonathan Price, who is an up and coming Colonel in the Argentine military. Evita then becomes the first lady when a military lead coup makes Peron President. As first lady, Evita is extremely popular with the general Argentinean population because she is considered to understand the needs of the lower class, as she came from a poor background herself. Peron exploits his wife&apos;s popularity by having Evita tour the world and run charitable foundations. As the story develops the narrator portrays Evita as increasingly more negative and aloof to her husband&apos;s repressive actions and policies.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint Evita has many inconsistencies, however, the general storyline is factual and based on Mary Main&apos;s biography of Eva Peron. Unfortunately, Mary Main&apos;s biography has been criticized as biased because much of her evidence was attained from anti-Peron sources. As a result the movie also shares this historical criticism, and many of the events and portrayals in the film have been disputed. The films&apos; suggestion that Evita was a terrible actress who slept her way to the top has been disproved by historians. Likewise, the film&apos;s portrayal of Evita&apos;s arrival in Buenos Aires as mistress of a married man has also been proved false. Nonetheless, the core historical events portrayed in the film are on the whole extremely accurate. The movie does a particularly good job of illustrating the social unrest and governmental corruption rampant in Argentina during the 1940&apos;s and 1950&apos;s. The film also correctly addresses the large gap between the rich and poor during the time period and its relative implications on society. All the dates, events and characters are based on historical fact, except for Che the narrator. This gives the movie a pseudo-realism that is unique from other musicals. As an educational film, Evita could be very helpful in depicting the events surrounding Peron&apos;s rise to power, as long as one notes the biases and alleged inconsistencies ahead of time.\n\nFrom an entertainment perspective, Evita is thoroughly enjoyable. Antonio Banderas in particular, does a fabulous job in his role of Che. Madonna, in the role she was &quot;born to play&quot;, is spotty at times, but on the whole is very commendable. The music, already famous from the play, is well incorporated into the movie and generally well sang by the cast. The simple cinematography allows the movie to progress very smoothly and incorporate Che in scenes the play never could. The story is widely held as a classic and is quite entertaining. Evita&apos;s realism allows viewers to associate themselves with aspects of Evita or any of the other characters lives, while the music makes the movie easy to follow and family friendly.\n\nClearly Evita is worth watching as it is both entertaining and educational, a rare combination. Although, one must be preemptively warned that the movie has been criticized from a historical viewpoint as being unfairly negative toward Evita. The movie also portrays the many charitable and positive actions lead by Evita. The movie makes no claims to be entirely historically accurate, and subsequently must be understood as entertainment first, and history second. Still, the movie provides a strong background in Argentine history and politics that are relevant even today. On a scale of one to ten I would rate the movie a nine for entertainment and a seven for historical accuracy.",

      "reviewBody": "This curious film is centered around Willy Fritsch, whose last film this is, and his son Thomas and is meant as a festive farewell to Fritsch senior and the launching of Fritsch junior&apos;s career (although he already made a couple of films). In a 1972 interview Fritsch senior said that almost every film after 1945 was not important being most of them of mediocre standards. I think this last film of his, alas, should be included; it has a tedious story not unlike the average German farce of that period, and the direction of Alex von Ambesser is very uninspired. The man should have been ashamed of himself to make this mediocre film for a someone who meant so much in and for German cinema in the 20&apos;s and 30&apos;s.\n\nBy the way, bits of Fritsch&apos;s earlier career can be seen in clips from early talkies: Melodie des Herzens (1929) and Der Kongreß tanzt (1931).\n\nThe cast tries hard to make something out of it; credit must go to Gustav Knuth, and Paul Hörbiger, who can also be seen in the clip from &quot;Kongreß&quot; and of whom Willy Fritsch remarks: Well, he is still filming!. And last but not least there is Willy Fritsch himself who up to the last moment stayed charming, elegant, always smiling and a bit ironic.\n\nThomas Fritsch would never really follow his father&apos;s footsteps: he is an average actor.",

      "reviewBody": "Novelist, justice campaigner and political activist Gilles Perrault wrote &apos;Le Derapage&apos; in 1987. He was not involved in this adaptation and by all accounts was thoroughly displeased with the finished product.\n\nSpeaking as one who has not read the original I would have to say that this is certainly one of Jacques Deray&apos;s best films and is arguably the finest of his nine collaborations with Alain Delon since &apos;La Piscine&apos; twenty-five years earlier. Sincere apologies to devotees of &apos;Borsalino&apos;!\n\nHaving successfully defended the young Frederic on a charge of having murdered both his parents lawyer Dunand is then informed by his client that he is in fact guilty.......\n\nThis is less like a film than a play that occasionally strays outside the proscenium arch and relies on the cat-and-mouse-game between Delon as Dunand and Manuel Blanc as Frederic. There are manifold twists and turns here but the film is driven by character rather than plot and both actors are splendid. Blanc here is following up his Cesar as &apos;most promising newcomer&apos; in &apos;J&apos;embrasse pas&apos; and Delon has his most interesting role since his own Cesar winning performance in the bizarre &apos;Notre Histoire&apos; of 1984.\n\nOne critic has said of Delon in this that behind every iconic star there is a great actor struggling to get out. I think that Monsieur Delon had already proved on more than one occasion that given the right material and director, he is capable of excellent performances. He made one more film with Deray and also had a stab at playing Casanova, although physically miscast. He went on to make his mark on the small screen but in terms of performance quality his portayal of Dunand represents his filmic last hurrah.\n\nWhen Deray shuffled off this mortal coil in 2003 he got a mention from President Jacques Chirac but was overlooked at the Cesar ceremony that year. Oversight or cinematic snobbery? I wonder.",

And here we have great actors but with a lousy script.\n\nFirst, let me note the historical issues that might have caused me to dislike this film: it was missing for about eighty years, then turned up in the Czech Film Archives about 2000. A video copy was made, but it runs at 56 minutes, with several cuts that indicate the film broke -- I guess Czechoslovakia was the end of the circuit ninety years ago -- and the big &apos;Meet Cute&apos; between Mary Pickford and John Bowers is substantially missing. In addition, the original titles are gone, with the current English titles being translations from the Czech.\n\nEven bearing this in mind, this picture is a stinker of a programmer, with only a few minutes of Mary&apos;s clowning in the middle to relieve the foolishness. Most of this can be blamed on poor writing.\n\nFor example, Mary and her brothers have just landed on the dock at New York, where uncle meets them, says &quot;I&apos;ll be right back&quot; and is promptly run over by a truck. He&apos;s in the hospital for a month. They&apos;re succored by a nice lady. When uncle gets out of the hospital a month later, there&apos;s no sign of worry about what&apos;s happened to his Dutch dependents. They don&apos;t seem overly upset at his absence either, even if they are happy when he finds them because at a news stand right outside the hospital he finds a magazine with a cover drawn by John Bowers&apos; character of Mary Pickford&apos;s character.\n\nHappens all the time.\n\nFor another annoyance, at the end, Mr. Bowers&apos; father is about to be thrown out as president of the railroad unless he can get a right of way from Mary&apos;s uncle -- he doesn&apos;t know the relationship. He wires his estranged son -- John Bowers, of course -- and tells him that if he seduces the niece and gets the uncle to sign the papers, he&apos;ll remember him in his will. Where this assumption of character came from.....\n\nWhy was Mary Pickford, Paramount&apos;s biggest star, in such a stinker? Because every time Charlie Chaplin cut a deal for a bigger salary, for a studio of his own, for his own distribution system, Miss Pickford, according to her autobiography, batted her eyes at Adolph Zukor and got more money. And in order for Paramount to make money on her contract, they had to put her in more movies. Paramount would do this over and over again, sometimes working their stars to death, but more usually turning out so many movies that the public became tired of them -- at one point, you could find six Marx Brothers movies running simultaneously in Manhattan, from the nabes for a dime, up to first-run houses for 50 cents -- and no one would pay to see them for fifty cents when you could see them for a dime and so DUCK SOUP tanked.\n\nAnyway, I digress. The technical aspects of this movie are fine for 1916. No money was spared for the production. The actors do their best. But it&apos;s still 90% you need a great script, and so this one is a lousy Pickford film. Even in Czech.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie many years ago in the 80&apos;s on TV and those snake men stuck with me. Their laugh/hissing and other mannerisms really brought them and the movie to life. Then, in the early 90&apos;s, I rented it some place and still found it to be an interesting, strange movie that seems more faithful to the look and feel of medieval fantasy than a lot of other movies at the time, or since! I could not care less about magic and whatnot in these movies but the snake men rock, no question about it. I recently won a copy on ebay and watched it. It still holds up. Yes it&apos;s dated, but it has an interesting sort of artsy feel to it. They made the most out of their budget on this one (think of the movie Laserblast), and the acting ranges from passable and good enough to pretty cool. The snake men STILL look great, as do plenty of other things in the movie, and for an 80&apos;s medieval fantasy flick it has an interesting, semi-complex story line that&apos;s not as cheesy as some far worse attempts at the time. A very dreamy like quality flows through the movie, with interesting camera affects here and there, including a sort reverse negative look (yet in color) if that&apos;s what it could be called. Another one of the things that helped this movie is that the cinematography is well done throughout, with some above average striking images here and there. No this is not Conan, or Dragonslayer filming quality, and it does have a made for TV feel to it (it was in fact a TV movie pilot for a series that did not happen). Even the electronic synthesizer score seems to get better as the movie goes along. The overall style of The Archer still is just enjoyable to watch. Indeed, in some places I far prefer it to the pacing of some recent flicks. They really try to immerse people here. This is very much a quest/adventure flick that seems greatly influenced by the rise of Dungeons and Dragons at the time. With the recent DVD release of so many other 80&apos;s medieval fantasy flicks (even Hawk the Slayer), I see no reason not to release The Archer to DVD. It was far more of a serious and well done attempt (by Universal Studios in 1981) at the medieval fantasy genre then many other medieval fantasy flicks were back then. Needs to be released on DVD!!",

It&apos;s a fun film that you will either like or not like. It doesn&apos;t take itself seriously. How can a movie that has Ashton Kutcher playing a trained killer working for &quot;some&quot; government agency. Ashton plays it a little campy, almost like a comic book character and that works, Katherine Heigl is her usual self. It&apos;s always good to see a beautiful Hollywood actress not looking like skin and bones. Tom Selleck plays Heigl&apos;s dad, a slightly predictable character. While the movie might be very predictable, it has its funny moments and while the pace isn&apos;t break neck, it does keep you entertained. Well, it entertained me.",

It&apos;s not comical, but it&apos;s filled with impossible &quot;shots&quot; fired by the tennis players. The ball moves as if they had a life of their own, supposedly &quot;controlled&quot; by the players. Japanese comic has tradition of super athletes like this beginning with Tetsuya Chiba&apos;s base ball saga &quot;Chikai No Makyu&quot; in the &apos;60s. This is yet another version of super athlete that can transform the ball into a magic &quot;bullet&quot;.\n\nThe movie is a good translation from the comic, and each of the players are presented in a believable fashion. It seems that they were expecting to make a sequel from the way the movie ended, but maybe the movie didn&apos;t perform well at the box office, and the idea was canned. \n\nSayuri Iwata and Yu Shirota puts in a good performance. Sayuri Iwata&apos;s role is one invented for this movie, and does not appear in the original comic.\n\nThe story is bit weak, but the action between the players are entertaining to watch. It&apos;s a good intro movie for the Prince of Tennis saga.",

      "reviewBody": "Of the three Rock Hudson-Doris Day films my absolute favorite is Lover Come Back. It&apos;s not only a good sex comedy for Doris and Rock, but it&apos;s also a very funny satire on the advertising business of Madison Avenue.\n\nIn Pillow Talk Doris was an interior decorator and Rock a songwriter. They haven&apos;t changed their characters at all, but now are both in the advertising business. \n\nThrough an incredible combination of circumstances I couldn&apos;t possibly write Rock has created commercials for a product that doesn&apos;t exist and the doofus son of the agency he works for, Tony Randall, has ordered them given full blown airing. With Doris nipping at his heels for unethical practices, Rock and Tony hire a nutty scientist played by Jack Kruschen to come up with some kind of product for the commercials.\n\nIn the meantime Doris mistakes Rock for the scientist and now we&apos;re back to the plot of Pillow Talk as Rock decides to make some time with Doris. It gets pretty wild and wacky, especially after Kruschen invents something that has some very unforeseen consequences.\n\nAll the cast members do just fine in this very bright comedy that has me splitting a gut with laughter every time I see it. In addition to the cast members mentioned, I should also single out Edie Adams as the southern model who Hudson makes the commercials with.\n\nAlso to be singled out in what turned out to be his farewell screen performance is Jack Oakie who plays the southern client who Rock steals from Doris and gets all the wacky nonsense started.\n\nEven given the changing mores, Lover Come Back holds up quite well and today&apos;s audience will love it as I do.",

Sentimental Swordsman, Magic Blade, Clans of Intrigue, Jade TIger were all made during this five year period. &quot;Death Duel&quot; is just one more during this time. As with his other films you can expect good photography, unique art direction and dozens of characters.\n\nAs with other successful Yuen Chor films, this one succeeds by focusing on one enigmatic main character for most of the film. However, the viewer will still have to deal with a lot of fascinating characters who show up and usually are killed off quickly. The body count in this film is very high. This film is very moody and the withdrawn character of Ah Chi make the story interesting. There are some uneven parts and the constant guest cameos from Shaw stars is a little annoying as you might wish that they would stick around longer in the film. That said, the script is above average, the pacing is good and by the time the ending comes around the film holds up.\n\nRecommended.",

I for one am not the biggest fan of zombie flicks, but I respect a movie with loads of gore and with a high level of cheese. And yep, Zombies: The Beginning delivers just that.\n\nThe story revolves around some cuteass Asian babe who plays a scientist of sorts. She&apos;s the lone survivor of a zombie rampage which left her entire crew/team dead. Events lead her back to the island where the zombies live...unlive. And as you can guess, loads of zombies and gore follow. Some weird turns in the story take place, but really, you&apos;re only really expecting the next scene of violence. Which basically, this film is fine for.\n\nZ:TB was pretty fun, but ultimately it was a tad too tedious, and just really amateurish. For example, in the first 20 minutes they show a nightmare our lead lady has been suffering from three times. No biggie if it&apos;s quick or cool, but nope. It&apos;s long and stupid....but understandable. Of course if you love cheesy, foreign zombie flicks, this shouldn&apos;t bother you in the slightest and you should feel right at home.\n\nIf you&apos;re a die hard fan of Mattei or zombies, there&apos;s no reason not to check it out. It delivers the red stuff, the awful (good thing) dubbing, and a ridiculous story. Just don&apos;t expect our leading lady to shed any clothing. Even with those nice boobs....no nudity. Oh well, at least there were some zombie boobs.",

      "reviewBody": "An unjustly neglected classic, &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; is one of the great films of the 1940&apos;s which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity.  Based on a story by William Faulker, and shot in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, &quot;Intruder&quot; tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man, and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to Beauchamp. Terrific acting, especially by two great character actors, Porter Hall (as the dead man&apos;s father) and Elizabeth Patterson (best known as Mrs. Trumbull on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;) as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done.  This straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.",

But this film deserves credit, naturally I checked here before I watched but afterwards I felt compelled to demonstrate some appreciation. No, you moron posters, it is NOT Prison Break, neither is it trying to be. After it finishes you&apos;ll want to watch it again. It looks real and gritty definitely not studio. I don&apos;t know enough about film to tell you if it was the script, acting, filming or anything else, it took me to a different place - Isn&apos;t that what we want most in a film?",

      "reviewBody": "While not necessarily one of my favorites from his more &quot;classic&quot; collection (Bloodsport, Kickboxer, etc.), I give this one a lot of credit for creating an overall highly suspenseful experience, full of intense action/chase sequences, and with more of a story than many other action-oriented efforts in its class. The script by Larry Ferguson (writer of The Hunt for Red October and definitely one of the more respected people to pen a Van Damme movie) places storytelling over action setups and, in general, feels a bit smarter than the average Van Damme vehicle. There isn&apos;t any real mystery to the story, though: the revelation of Alain&apos;s brother and his affiliation with the Russian mafia is dealt with without too much buildup, and the story begins to revolve around Alain retreading his brother&apos;s unsuccessful steps to distance himself from the mob and escape from corrupt FBI agents. His relationship with his brother&apos;s old flame (Natasha Henstridge, Species) is interesting at first but is then more or less dropped into your lap. Nevertheless, the movie never loses a sense of suspense: Alain doesn&apos;t seem quite as empowered as other characters Van Damme was playing at the time, so it rarely seems impossible that he could be killed. Soundly-weighed production values by director Lam help set a good mood and the art direction is, at times, inspired.\n\nThe film features a pretty good cast, including Jean-Hugues Anglade (Betty Blue) as Alain&apos;s partner and David Hemblen (Exotica) in a limited role as the leader of the Russian mafia, but the unexpected dramatic moment of the picture belongs to Van Damme for a surprisingly adept instance of silent acting near the end of the movie wherein Alain listens to a recorded message by his late brother. Ringo Lam would continue to bring a little something extra out of Jean-Claude in the future, even directing him to his first-ever dramatic award nomination five years later, but &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; is probably the most palatable of all their collaborations for its all-around strengths and mainstream appeal.\n\nOverall rating: 7 out of 10.",

I first learned about it at the Providence Public Library, when I was a grad student. I saw the box cover and immediately thought of my family. The smiling faces of the two hard working Pakistani men, reminded me of my uncles, who came to America and worked such hard jobs to give opportunities to their families. I had to see it. The film is magnificent. I was so taken by the relationships. Buddy Uzzaman or professionally known as Badl Uzzaman along with Bhasker, and Ric Young were sensational. Their mastery of the German language was very impressive. Badl Uzzaman and Bhasker continue to work in England. Ric Young has become more and more popular in America with his work on &quot;ALIAS.&quot; All three of these men should have been nominated for Academy Awards. Their performances were breathtaking. The music is also very touching. Go see this film. Tell everyone you know. It needs to be seen by all. Amen.",

Gene Hackman, Harry Dean Stanton and Karen Black compliment him nicely in a dated yet refreshing picture about a has-been musician who&apos;s recently quit dealing drugs. Hackman is a psychotic narc who blackmails him into selling stolen marijuana and Black is his put-upon live-in girlfriend that&apos;s just about had it with Pike&apos;s freewheeling ways. An extremely moody piece, punctuated with quick but successful comedic moments and quietly tense scenes. CISCO PIKE is from that early 70&apos;s less-is-more period of filmmaking and makes a great diversion from the feces currently hurled at us from Hollywood. Just goes to show that good movies age well, regardless of the pop culture it contains within."

I actively seek out the sickest films on earth, and had thought myself hopelessly jaded. Now, for the first time in years, I find myself genuinely shocked. Of the thousands of horror films I&apos;ve seen, Iki-jigoku ranks in the 10 sickest of them all.\n\nAn excruciating examination of cruelty and insanity, this film makes Make Them Die Slowly look like The Jungle Book. A very cringe inducing mother and daughter team, with amazingly reserved glee, torture a wheelchair bound young man in his own (apparently very well soundproofed) home. With each new scene, I would grind my teeth in dread and anticipation as new and more wretched horrors were visited upon our long suffering (and suffering and suffering) hero.\n\nAbout an hour into the movie, things take a completely insane turn. Humor darker than a cosmic black hole permeates the films decent into total madness.\n\nIf this were a lousy film (and lets face it, most horror films are), I would have still been pleasantly appalled. However, this movie was actually GREAT! The cinematography was creative without drawing too much attention to itself, the lighting was damned perfect, and the performances were absolutely believable.\n\nThose who are not truly horror film junkies will undoubtedly not understand, but if you are among the converted, SEE THIS FILM, even if you have to watch some third generation dub like I did (far be it from Americans to release something this bold).\n\nI have just one question: are the Japanese the only people on the face of the earth who can create REAL horror movies anymore?",

It reveals little about Kubrick&apos;s vision or intent and everything about their specific and sometimes downright crazy views about the world as expressed through their interpretations of Kubrick&apos;s movie. Room 237 demonstrates the deep impact a film can have when something about it resonates with the particular psychology or beliefs of members of its audience. The real brilliance of The Shining is that it created an almost palpable atmosphere of dread while remaining enigmatic and opaque. It&apos;s a Rorschach test to be freely interpreted by its audience.",

The plot wasn&apos;t that unique and it was so short with nothing really happening, and it was predictable. Yuck! I&apos;m sure they had fun making it, but I didn&apos;t have fun watching it. And I don&apos;t think anyone else in the theater did either, instead when it FINALLY ended everyone just kinda hurried out of their in silence (nothing good to talk about).

      "reviewBody": "Watched this at a London preview screening\n\nThis was a cleverly structured drama depicting a lengthy span of a family&apos;s life by rolling the events of one day in each phase of their lives. Its so well done that you really care about how their lives pan out. I felt it conveyed a message that life is too short to waste, so make the most of it. Bizarrely though, there&apos;s one message that seems rather twisted, you can only really enjoy yourself if you smoke something with a bit of kick in it! OK..I&apos;ll go try that...\n\nHow their lives pan out can be a tad predictable because this has been done before. But this movie rolls with so much panache, drama, nostalgia, a superb soundtrack, and lots of humour. In fact I laughed out loud a few times. The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the actor playing the father. He doesn&apos;t say much but you can read so much in his subtle expressions.\n\nI think this is a film that has got such a universal appeal which most people can relate to in some way. Its highly entertaining and very well paced.",

      "name": "Disturbing in many ways, but gets better as it goes along",
      "reviewBody": "I hated the first half of this film so much that I thought it would almost certainly get a scathing review and one of the lowest possible review scores from me. It&apos;s unpleasant to say the least, and problematic in several ways, the biggest of which is its treatment of women. You see, amidst the squalor of a slum near a U. S. Army base, a young woman is raped by a sleazeball posing as her rescuer, and she wants to marry him instead of going to the police. Obviously a big part of that relates to the culture and time period, and the (disgusting) reality that as a &quot;ruined&quot; woman she may not be able to get another man to marry her. However, it builds on this. In a second encounter, he slaps her around, and she embraces him tenderly anyway. We soon see her placated, demurely eating a watermelon, and aside from fear over the man&apos;s cruelty to another woman, we don&apos;t really see signs of her trauma. When she says &quot;I saw it as fate and resigned myself to forgiving Joe. It seemed like one way to find a mate,&quot; it&apos;s beyond nauseating.\n\nMeanwhile, Kobayashi gives us the various doings of Les Misérables in the slum, the subplots of which are unpleasant to watch and don&apos;t develop into anything much. In one scene, they argue with a woman about their excrement being used to help fertilize a garden. In another, they refuse to give blood to help a man who desperately needs a transfusion. In yet another, a woman tries to seduce the virtuous young man, but her husband catches her and physically assaults her. Later, when she turns to prostitution, he threatens to tie her up and beat her. All is selfishness, and there is no honor to be found anywhere.\n\nThe undercurrent to all of this moral decay is that it&apos;s due to the American occupiers, something signaled without nuance or reference to the Japanese militarism that brought on the war. We see the base and English signs for bars and brothels prominently in the background. When the lone virtuous man in the film asserts in indignation that &quot;Japan is an independent nation,&quot; he&apos;s hit with the reality that the denizens of the slum have to pay for the utilities of the American base. We also see what is almost certainly the racist use of African American servicemen to heighten the sense of depravity.\n\nDespite these issues, the film turned itself around in its second half. While the film is never full free of misogyny, the woman&apos;s motivations become a little clearer, and when the story begins focusing on the love triangle coming to a head, it&apos;s at its strongest. One guy (Fumio Watanabe) is a student, the other (wonderfully sinister Tatsuya Nakadai) is a violent game leader, and in their struggle for the woman (Ineko Arima), there is a fight for the soul of Japan, an old trope. The woman taking control of her own destiny and how the conflict was resolved was satisfying and cathartic.\n\nThe story about the slum being sold so that it can be demolished and turned into a &quot;love hotel&quot; doesn&apos;t end quite as strongly or as happily, but perhaps in that it balanced out the main story line. The residents must all agree to leave before it can be sold, and we see some of them bribed, and others who have their signature stamps forged. A &quot;communist&quot; tries to get them to stand together but fails, lamenting &quot;Workers minds never seem to advance. This is hopeless. The military and the authorities always exert control over the workers.&quot; There is a sense of capitalist greed and corruption triumphing because the common man is uneducated and disorganized, a dark truism.\n\nIt&apos;s a tough one to rate because of how unpleasant the first half was, but in the end, I found that I was glad I had seen it for the little window it provided. The cinematography and cool jazz soundtrack helped as well. Not one I&apos;d recommend necessarily though.",

I used to watch &quot;The Ewok Adventure&quot; on VHS when I was younger and was a huge fan - I&apos;d view it frequently (probably even before I saw all the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films) and, although I recognized it was cheesy even as a child, I still enjoyed it.\n\nToday, it simply doesn&apos;t hold up. It comes across as a desperate and silly cash-in on &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV: Return of the Jedi.&quot; The &quot;lovable&quot; Ewoks of that film return here to wreak more havoc - they find a boy and his younger sister after they crash land on the planet. The boy and sister have lost their parents, whom were apparently grabbed out of the space ship by some scary alien creature.\n\nThe alien creature&apos;s special F/X are absolutely terrible which explains why his full frontal view is saved until the ending - which is ludicrous and way over-the-top.\n\nIf you&apos;re a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan you&apos;ll need to own this simply because it&apos;s got the Lucas &quot;stamp of approval&quot; - but to any casual viewer it comes across as a desperate and pathetic franchise cash-in.",

      "reviewBody": "Fritz Lang&apos;s last American work &quot; beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; was a commercial failure and it was panned at the time -nowadays ,and mainly in Europe ,critics are inclined to reverse their opinions.Actually &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt &quot; could easily be &quot;remade&quot; (God preserve us!) today because its screenplay with the unexpected final twist is trendy(1) .Afterward,Lang returned to Germany and began to film what was an old plan of his (it was filmed ,but by other directors),written by his ex-wife Thea Von Harbou.\n\nThe gap between &quot;Der Tiger von Eschnapur&quot; and &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; (and &quot;human desire&quot; &quot;while the city sleeps&quot; &quot;clash by night&quot; &quot;the big heat&quot; etc) seems so wide that a lot of people did not recognize &quot;their &quot; Fritz Lang.One could answer them that ,already in the mid-fifties ,Lang had adapted for the screen &quot;Moonfleet&quot; ,his first color experiment with startling results .And &quot;Moonfleet&quot; too did not seem to belong to Lang&apos;s canon.&quot;Moonfleet &quot; was a tour de force because it was a whole story seen through a child&apos;s eye.Something magic was born ,and it&apos;s this magic we find again in &quot;Der Tiger von Eschnapur&quot;.\n\n&quot;Der Tiger von Eschnapur&quot; is a 4 million marks movie and the most accessible of all Lang&apos;s works:it can appeal to a child as much as to a professor .At first sight,it appears as an adventure yarn ,close to comic strip ,some kind of &quot;Fritz Lang and the temple of doom&quot; ,but a director like him cannot be brought down to only that.\n\n&quot;Der Tiger von Eschnapur&quot; is a visual splendor ,with an unusually inventive use of color,which is not unlike his British peer Michael Powell (Black orchid,thief of Bagdad).Lang was an architect ,and it&apos;s impossible not to feel it,here more than in his entire American period. It&apos;s no coincidence if his hero (Henri Mercier/Harald Berger) is an architect too;they are always holding and studying plans .Lang&apos;s camera perfectly captures the space it describes .Mercier (Paul Hubschmid)is often filmed in high angle shot,in the huge palace of the Maharajah,in the tiger pit ,or later,in the second part ,in the dungeon where he&apos;s imprisoned.Actually,and it&apos;s obvious,it takes us back to Lang&apos;s German silent era ,particularly &quot;der müde Tod&quot; &quot;die Niebelungen&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot;.\n\n&quot;Der Tiger von Eschnapur&quot; is essentially a movie of exposition:some scenes which seem overlong (Paget&apos;s dance),irrelevant(the lepers ) are actually necessary to prepare the stage for part two.And this leads us to one of Lang&apos;s permanent features:the coexistence of two worlds.\n\nBehind the lavishly furnished palace,the sumptuous clothes,the sparkling jewels ,there&apos;s another world beneath.The scene when Mercier meets the lepers scrawling on the ground ,and in a simpler but no less harrowing ,Baharani&apos;s blood seeping out of the basket are hints at a darker side of the luminous magic world of Chandra.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot to say about &quot;der Tiger von Eschapur&quot; :the flight through the desert recalls sometimes Henri -Georges Clouzot&apos;s &quot;Manon&quot; (1949),as Mercier&apos;s madness breaks out and he begins to fire at the sun.\n\n&quot;Der Tiger von Eschnapur&quot; is a must.\n\n(1) it was finally remade and as expected it was a disaster",

      "reviewBody": "The opening scenes of Stephen Poliakoff&apos;s film, &apos;Close My Eyes&apos;, are truly mesmerising. We see a floodlit bowling green, incongruously (but, given that one of the subplots of the movie turns out to concern urban planning law, not irrelevantly) positioned amongst tower blocks; meanwhile a young woman (Natalie, played by Saskia Reeves) is smoking a cigarette on a balcony, possibly in one of those same blocks. As the credits fade, the camera homes in on a young man in a hurry (Richard, played by Clive Owen), passing by the bowlers; it turns out that the woman is his estranged sister, and he&apos;s late. She, on the other hand, is upset, and looks to him for comfort; and in the middle of the night, they share a moment of affection that goes a little bit beyond what siblings ought to do. The unfolding of their lives over the next few years is then summarised through a depiction of their subsequent (non-) interactions: he is every bit the strident, ambitious, fornicating yuppie; while she feels lost and uncertain, with a brother-shaped hole in her life. But after years abroad, Richard comes home, rather surprisingly to take a lowly paid public sector job. And then Natalie, whom he has almost forgotten, gets in touch and invites him to meet her new husband, Sinclair (played wonderfully by Alan Rickman, in probably his finest role). Sinclair is a millionaire futurologist, a man both kindly, but also child-like in his fundamental inability to empathise. And Natalie, who has gained a new confidence, starts to come on to Richard with a very definite intent. The skill with which the film effectively tells half its story in just a handful of minutes, with brilliantly selected visuals replacing the need for expository dialogue, is breathtaking; one can hardly take one&apos;s eyes off the screen.\n\nBut for all Poliakoff&apos;s brilliantly striking imagery, the film manifests some serious defects. To start with, the subsequent plotting doesn&apos;t quite work. The central idea appears to be that ambitious Richard falls in love with his sister, but she is only game-playing; he then falls apart. But the film keeps its distance from its characters, sometimes their motivation (beyond raw sexual passion) is unclear, and some of their behaviour seems forced to fit the dictates of plot. One could also argue that, in dealing with incest, the film is slightly dishonest. It wants to be seen to explore a taboo, but creates a scenario in which two consenting, independent adults find themselves in a very unusual situation: to put it another way, the reason incest is taboo is because it is almost invariably exploitative, whereas this relationship is not (at least, not in the way that generally characterises the phenomenon).\n\nAnother aspect of this movie is Poliakoff&apos;s decision to set his movie in a landscape more symbolic than real. We witness the progression of an almost supernaturally idyllic affair, made even more perfect by being set in contrast to the spectre of A.I.D.S. Sexual intercourse takes place between beautiful bodies disrobing from beautiful clothing in beautiful places. Alan Rickman plays the sort of eccentric genius whom we instinctively feel is exactly what a millionaire should be like, though in reality, one suspects, most are none of the sort. Even the supposedly wretched council offices where Richard takes up his new job have more the feel of a trendy design consultancy than of grim municipal poverty. More generally, Poliakoff&apos;s films invariably set up contrasts between worlds defined by qualities such as power, sex, or tradition; but never seem to recognise that all these qualities, far from being opposites, are just different attributes that identify some as the &quot;haves&quot; of our society, as opposed to the &quot;have-nots&quot;. There are a few images of the homeless, of the truly dispossessed, in this film, but they only exist as images; while the real drama plays out within a gilded circle. In some respects, it&apos;s this romantic other-worldliness that makes the film so physically striking. But social realism it ain&apos;t.\n\nDoes this make it a bad film? On the contrary, one could say it&apos;s a great film. But the roots of Poliakoff&apos;s later disaster, &apos;The Tribe&apos;, are clearly on show here, alongside evidence of his rare gift for combining intelligence and beauty, in this fascinatingly flawed film.",

      "reviewBody": "History is the study of man&apos;s past. To some it&apos;s merely a collection of events, to others it&apos;s a series of memories, but to a certain segment of people, it&apos;s the sum collection of heritage and honor. In this incredible black and dark movie originally called &apos;Murderous Intent&apos;, but retitled &quot;Like Minds&quot; it&apos;s the tale of two boys. Alex (Eddie Redmayne, incredible acting) and Nigel Colbie (Tom Sturridge, intriguing performance) attending the same private school. Although they seem at odds with other, they are in fact much closer than meets the eye. When a series of murders catch the attention of the local constabulary it falls to Inspector McKenzie (Richard Roxburgh) to solve them. His conclusions are quick and to the point, but he needs a psychological profile of one student to close the case. A Psychologist (Toni Collette) is called in and soon is embroiled in a battle of wits with an extremely manipulative young man, who relates the story of his evil school friend. One, she is certain is the mastermind, the other is a conniving and controlling con-artist, who believes in his family history and blood line to up hold tradition and any measures necessary to achieve a holy means. Not since Alfred Hitchcock has such dark drama been offered to an audience. Writer/Director Gregory Read has indeed surpassed that goal. Excellent suspense and shadowy mayhem for those interested in a twisted plot with an equally twisted conclusion. ****",

      "reviewBody": "Watching this film is an enjoyable event. With a cast of hilarious and respected actors and actresses, this movie is one of the funniest and greatest Toho sci-fi movies I&apos;ve seen. It starts off with an intriguing intro of how a scientist discovers disappearing satellites in space.\n\nThen, it kicks off to these band of outrageous gangsters who wants sparkling diamonds for their loot. The suspense builds when some of the gangsters get lifted up into the air by an unknown phenomenon, later known as Dagora (or Dogara) the Space Monster, who has a thing for diamonds. Instead of buildings, vehicles, bridges, and structures crushing to the floor, they actually rise to the air as Dagora lifts away everything in its path. Dagora is seen in many shapes and sizes, including a giant jellyfish (with &quot;animated&quot; tentacles), shining &quot;stars,&quot; and a floating piece of genetic-like substance. Screenplay writer Shinichi Sekizawa did an excellent job on the script.\n\nThe scientists trying to figure out a weapon in order to use to defend Japan from Dagora while the detectives try to nab the diamond lovers couldn&apos;t be more inspiring and intriguing in this movie. Composer Akira Ifukube gave a haunting and terrific music score and director Ishiro Honda directed one of his best. Some hilarious parts in the movie includes the part where the character Inspector Kommei tries to shoot a gun, only with confetti coming out; the part where Eiji the Safecracker eats a sugar crystal (which he later found out is a fake diamond) and then laughs like a hyena; the scenes of karate fights and the part where the Gangster Moll asks the train conductor to show her where to make a call when the phone is actually a few inches away from her! The only jewelry oriented monster sci-fi flick I&apos;ve seen, this film is to be watched by all sci-fi fans. There are some plot-holes here and there, like why did the gangsters have to wait so long to steal the diamonds from Jackson, and why did the Gangster Moll have to call her crew to come meet her, since she wants the diamonds all to herself anyways? Could have used more action and suspense from the gangsters, but overall, a fun film. You&apos;ll never wear a diamond necklace or diamond ring the same way again.\n\nGrade A-",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in November 1987 after watching the movie on International Video Entertainment video cassette.\n\n&quot;Strike Commando&quot; is a run-of-the-mill Italian war picture imitating &quot;Rambo&quot;. Made last year, pic was recently given a token release in Kansas City, ahead of its current home video availability.\n\nReb Brown fits the bill as brawny Michael Ransom, sole survivor of a deadly mission in Vietnam by the crack Strike Commando force. Befriended by local villages, he spots Russianofficers in action and is sent back in by his commander (Christopher Connelly) to get photographic evidence of he Russkies.\n\nWith dumb dialog (beefy Russian played by Alex Vitale insists on calling the hero &quot;Americanski&quot;), pic slavishly imitates the second &quot;Rambo&quot; film leading to a touch of &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (bare-knuckled fight between the two musclemen) as well. At least a reel or two overlong, film has an idiotic, padded coda set about 15 years later in Manila.\n\nSome okay minor action scenes do not disguise the fact that the film lacks the large-scale set pieces that have become de rigueur for Vietnam war pics. Worst scene has Brown unsuccessfully (in an obvious stretch) simulating tears and pathos as he holds a dying little Vietnamese boy in his arms -cut to him with machine gun in hand bellowing a war cry, fully motivated."

Because this is what I saw in the film, a lot of commitment and a lot of will as well as a lot of skill and a truly beautiful and compelling story. This film also does a good job of telling a story without mystifying the criminals too much as sometimes happens in these films.",

His one weak area in this film was editing. There is no reason this movie couldn&apos;t have been half an hour shorter. Right off the bat, there were unnecessarily lingering camera shots and scenes that could have omitted. Off the top of my head, I&apos;m thinking of Spike himself sliding under a woman&apos;s skirt and mugging the camera. That scene not only failed to further the story but instead made the audience stand up and say, &quot;Hey, that&apos;s Spike looking at us!&quot; Lee&apos;s biggest editing mistake was based on his desire to tell the story of Malcolm X AND tell the story of the African-American experience. That&apos;s more than enough for several movies so why cram it all under one title? After a clear scene illustrating X&apos;s life, Lee would move to a large dance hall to illustrate the richness of the African-American experience. A quick shot of the dance hall would have been sufficient. Instead the far away shots were maintained for too long and when the focus moved back to specific characters it moved to the character played by Lee himself. Why? I don&apos;t know. It certainly didn&apos;t help us to understand X any better. The ending with children saying &quot;I am Malcolm X&quot; also went on too long and should have been part of a separate feature. The cameos were distracting. The movie could have been tighter, shorter, and better except that Spike Lee wanted to put everything, including the kitchen sink, into it.\n\nThat being said, it is a great movie and I&apos;m glad I invested the three and a half hours to watch it.",

      "reviewBody": "A young scientist comes to a research institute as an intern and is given charge of a department investigating an area of particular interest to him. Associated with each of us a force field has been discovered, and instrumentation has been set up to measure its strength. It is not clear what this field represents, nor is clear the significance of its strength, which varies with the experimental subject. The intern has nonetheless computed a theoretical maximum value of 977, and despite frustrations is undeterred in his investigation, in contrast to the institute director and others, who have varied character and motivations. Certain events take place indicating to us characteristics of this force, both universal and profound as well as an elusiveness. An avid art-house enthusiast may recognize Ekaterina Golubeva, actress and collaborator (co-wrote A Casa) in films by Lithuanian film director Sharunas Bartas, noted for a certain opaqueness, but the director here is not harsh on the viewer. A second viewing revealed what escaped me the first time. It became obvious what the film is about (I won&apos;t spoil it but your first guess is probably correct) and where closure is not intended. The lack of closure is part of the genius of this film. I may add that a commercial release has subtitles in both Russian and English, and English subtitles are available separately. I may also add that French film director Leos Carax (Pola X with lead actress Ekaterina Golubeva) has a small part in 977.",

If everyone had to see one Sandler movie before their lives were complete, I would seriously hope this is the movie they see. It&apos;s nice to see golf and hockey in a movie again. I don&apos;t think there is another movie out there that makes me laugh as much as &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; does. You have Happy, the ultimate hero, fighting to win a life of security for his grandma. There&apos;s Shooter McGavin, the villain you love to hate, who attempts to foil Happy&apos;s quest. And then there&apos;s Mr. Larson, Happy&apos;s 8&apos; tall monster of a former employer, threatening Shooter at every turn. Hey Bob Barker is in this movie! It doesn&apos;t get much funnier than Mr. Price Is Right insulting our hero. Well maybe Ben Stiller&apos;s part in this movie is funnier, as he corruptly directs a retirement home. It doesn&apos;t matter what&apos;s the funniest. This whole movie is one hilarious moment after another.",

      "reviewBody": "According to the Italian Wikipedia, this movie was adapted from an eponymous Italian TV show. It consists of loosely-assembled sketches where Gassman is given a free hand to go through various characters and disguises.\n\nThe whole thing is watchable, of course, but suffers from the lack of dramatic tension since there&apos;s barely a storyline. Besides, most sketches were possibly funny 60 years ago, now they bring a smile at best - you see the gags coming from a distance. Gassman is of course a terrific presence, but in some episodes he&apos;s completely over-the-top.\n\nStrangely enough, the most endearing moments of the movie, as far as I&apos;m concerned, were some &quot;transition&quot; sequences which show peeks of everyday&apos;s life in the Italy of 1960 - scenes with Dorian Gray, the restaurant sequences, shots of the poor Roma suburbs... All in all a minor movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Ivan the Terrible Part II, the culmination of Eisenstein&apos;s career, is easily one of the most brilliant films of all time.\n\nNothing - repeat absolutely nothing - in this film is sub-par. The acting, especially the inhuman physical contortions of Nikolai Cherkasov as the Tsar himself, is uniformly excellent. As is to be expected from Eisenstein, the direction is perfect. Eisenstein&apos;s compositions create painterly tableaux that can be watched endlessly on pause (especially now that Criterion has issued both Ivans on DVD), allowing the audience to take in the full breadth of this man&apos;s genius. Additionally, unlike, for example, Alexander Nevsky or Strike, Ivan the Terrible Part II (and part I) benefits from a smoother pace and better editing, putting Eisenstein&apos;s theory of montage to its best use since Potemkin.\n\nFor me, however, what two key components of this film set it apart from its prequel and Eisenstein&apos;s earlier Potemkin and October.\n\nThose components, as you can imagine, are its more pronounce political allegory and its color sequence towards the end.\n\nCertainly October and Potemkin were highly politicized affairs, both celebrating the Communist victory in Russia. In Ivan the Terrible Part II (and to a lesser extent Part I), the audience bears witness to a moment of challenge wherein Eisenstein becomes critical of the course his country and its post-Lenin leaders have taken. As such, Ivan the Terrible becomes one of the bravest moments in film history and, for that alone, should be commended.\n\nBrilliant as a political critique, the film also represents a dazzling demonstration of how color could be used in cinema. The colorized dance at the end of the film rivals and prefigures the technicolor explosion in Douglas Sirk&apos;s 1950s melodramas; furthermore, it reveals that color can be used to achieve specific effects. It does not have to mimic reality; rather it can be used artistically to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the film.\n\nTaken as a whole, the two-part Ivan the Terrible is a masterpiece of Russian Cinema and should be required viewing for anyone with the slightest bit of interest in film. My preference lies with the second part, but both are fantastic moments in film history."

Chartracters are all identified and that is the only part of the film that detracts from the viewing. The film is in Chinese and by the time you have read the subtitles the characters names are gone. The film is enjoyable if you know Chinese history of this period and if you don&apos;t it can be just a series of talking and action scenes and can be quite confusing. Sun yat-sen is the main character but Jackie Chan does get to be more than just an action figure. If you want to more about this period of Chinese this would be the movie to spur you on or illustrate better what was going on in China at this time. Yuan Shi-kai is one character who has appeared in a lot of historical films portraying this period and his actions are as always ones of greed and betrayal.",

      "reviewBody": "Good Italian movies are few and far between – the last I saw was Zefferelli&apos;s &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot;, and before that, &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;. It seems that Italian movies, good or bad, are rare. If the list in Wikipedia is anything to go by, Italy produces about ten to fifteen features a year, far less than Australia.\n\nThis one is about growing up in a post-Mussolini, post-war world as a working class Italian. The narrator, Accio (Elio Germano), bright but temperamental, is not the most pleasant of people (his name means bully). At 13 he is sent off to a seminary by his long-suffering and pious parents but even though it&apos;s a fairly humane regime he doesn&apos;t last long. So it&apos;s back to the family&apos;s tiny, crumbling flat to grow up with his older brother, Manrico (Riccardo Scarmarcio). Rejecting religion, Accio comes into the orbit of the local fascists, though he is more interested in action than ideology. The handsome, charming Manrico becomes a communist, and beds Francesca (Diane Fleri), an attractive middle class girl who has joined the comrades. Naturally Accio gets interested in Francesca as well.\n\nThe story covers the period 1962 to 1968 and plenty of reference is made to the turmoil of the times, but basically it is about a textbook case of sibling rivalry. Acco and Manrico cannot keep their hands off each other – in order to fight, that is. Acco however does manage to reach some sort of maturity at the end.\n\nThe story moves along at a good pace and there are plenty of funny scenes. The best one is the occupation by the communist students during the 1968 disturbances of the Rome conservatory where they perform Beethoven&apos;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; with the words changed to communist slogans, and are then invaded by the fascists crying &quot;Don&apos;t mess with Beethoven&quot; (actually the original words were from a poem by Schiller). The switch of actors (Vittorio Propizio plays the younger Accio) is accomplished in a particularly neat fashion, using a method I last saw used in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; where the older actor is substituted in mid-scene.\n\nIn the background is Mussolini&apos;s legacy, an angry, confused and humiliated nation without a clear sense of direction. His 1930&apos;s &quot;new towns&quot; like Latina on the Pontine marches, jerry-built and badly designed, were crumbling already by the 1960s. Replacement housing had been built but corrupt local officials were holding up its allocation. There is a very satisfying moment at the end of the film when Accio, no stranger to causing a ruckus, takes remedial action.\n\nNot being Italian I probably missed a lot, but the film held my attention for its full length, despite Accio not being a particularly nice lad (then neither was Genghis Khan and he had an interesting life). The film is bright, fresh and fast-moving though I&apos;m not sure about the climax, which is rather on the melodramatic side. If the Italians can bring themselves to make more movies of this quality, I&apos;ll come along to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Raintree County, MGM&apos;s attempt to make a picture that would faintly remind audiences of Gone With the Wind, did have two things in common with the earlier film: Technicolor and length.  Otherwise, it was a disaster, a clichéd  period piece heavy on costumes, very light on absorbing human situations.\n\nRaintree had two insurmountable problems: ham-handed direction and a clumsy, uninspired script that failed to flesh out the characters of several cast members including two leading players.  Worst impacted was Monty Clift as Johnny Shawnessy, a role so bland that it offered the actor nothing to grab hold of. Johnny is simply a nice person, honorable, loyal, patient, and truthful.  He is someone of good values, a person to rely on, occasionally funny in an adolescent sort of way, and a good son to his boring two-dimensional parents. (Correction.  Agnes Moorhead as Johnny&apos;s mother is one dimensional.  The script&apos;s fault, not hers.)  In short, there&apos;s nothing interesting about Johnny.  He&apos;s ordinary.  Apparently, studio executives didn&apos;t see a problem with this, even though Johnny Shawnessy is continuously front and center in a film that originally ran for almost three hours, as it does again in the restored video version.\n\nClift, one of the most gifted American film actors of the twentieth century, knew he was prostituting himself by appearing in Raintree.  He responded by delivering what is arguably the worst performance of his career.  It&apos;s painful to watch him: in most of his scenes he appears pallid, slightly dwarfish, and  insignificant, giving the impression that he was privately making believe he really wasn&apos;t in the film at all.\n\nThe first excruciating hour of the picture is almost enough to drive audiences out of the theater.  Since GWTW was long, Raintree County is long--and unfocused.  In one particularly vapid scene Monty and Eva Marie Saint linger amid the widescreen splendor of well-scouted, photographically appropriate locations.  As the two exchange graduation presents with Laurel and Hardy-like formality, the script calls for Eva Marie to coyly break into girlish giggles and say things like `Isn&apos;t that niiieeccce?...We think the same things.  Isn&apos;t that crazy?  Tee-hee-hee-hee-hee.&apos; Privately, Eva Marie must have been wondering what crime she might have committed to have caused fate to whirl  her from the triumph of her 1954 performance in On the Waterfront to this swampy  mess.\n\nThe film is equally inept in making use of Lee Marvin, who was reduced to doing his loutish, clumsy, I&apos;m-so-dumb schtick.  Marvin wasn&apos;t nearly as good at broad physical comedy as he and some others seemed to think he was. (Doing more subtle comedy, however, where less is more, was another thing altogether for Marvin.  Watch him as a clueless wannabe in a wonderful film like Pocket Money to see what he can do with a great comic role.)  We watch as Lee challenges Monty first to a race (lots of grotesquely exaggerated, manly calisthenics at the starting line), then to see who can out-drink the other, while a dozen equally buffoonish male extras shout and yell on cue. Johnny, a guileless innocent, gets thoroughly looped for the first time in his life, whoops it up, and executes a flying swan dive into a bunch of liquor barrels.  (In real life, Monty was a little less innocent than Johnny Shawnessy; according to his biographers, he was a walking all-nite pharmacy of illicit substances.)\n\nTo give credit where it&apos;s due, the film is briefly buoyed by the presence of the wonderful Nigel Patrick as a roguish schoolmaster with an eye for other men&apos;s wives.  Happily for us, Patrick steals all of his scenes, impatiently bellowing at or comically insulting his young charges and generally pumping some desperately needed fire and energy into the film.\n\nAfter a very long time, something of major interest finally occurs: Elizabeth Taylor makes her entrance.  Sexy, conniving, dark-eyed Liz steals Johnny away from poor, decent  Eva Marie and soon hornswoggles him into marrying her by falsely claiming to be pregnant.  While on their honeymoon aboard a paddlewheeler, she nonchalantly arranges a dozen dolls on their bed and shows Monty her all-time favorite, a hideous half-white, half-black doll, appearing burnt in a fire and looking like it was designed by Bela Lugosi.  This creepy figurine seemingly makes no impression on Monty, even as members of the audience are rearing back in horror, crossing themselves, and yelling `Monty! Watch out!!&apos;\n\nTaylor delivers a solid performance that displays the rising talent that she had already shown a few years before in A Place in the Sun and which would later would come to fruition in such films as  Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Giant.  As Susanna Drake, she is initially sexually beguiling towards Johnny.  Then, after they marry, she begins to show the first signs of the madness within her.  As the atmosphere around her grows slowly darker, you find yourself surprised to realize you&apos;re at last being drawn into the story.  The actress took a gamble with this unsympathetic role, that of a southern-born woman who fails to see anything wrong with owning slaves and is terrified of possibly finding that she might have a single drop of `negra&apos; blood in her veins.  At the same time she manages to elicit a measure of sympathy for this narrow and unbalanced woman by displaying a touching vulnerability simultaneously with her fear of what&apos;s happening to her mind.\n\nIf anyone triumphs in this upholstered turkey, it&apos;s Liz Taylor, always a born survivor."

      "reviewBody": "Have you ever watched a film and wished it wouldn&apos;t end? Where you loved all the characters, adored each scene, and laughed at every joke, even after you&apos;d seen the film so many times that you could quote the dialog? MY FAVORITE YEAR is that kind of movie!\n\nDirected with gusto by Richard Benjamin, the film is both a loving tribute to Sid Caesar&apos;s &apos;Your Show of Show&apos;, and the remarkable talents that brought it together each week, and a sincere homage to Errol Flynn, whose antics and larger-than-life persona, in the waning years of his life, still had a kind of magic that could enthrall a shy young fan, or make a woman swoon.\n\nThree dynamic performances dominate the film. Mark Linn-Baker, as Benjy Stone, based on the young Mel Brooks, is a shy kid who hides his insecurities behind a rapid-fire wit. The dazzling young star in a staff of comedy &apos;pros&apos;, Stone suffers from an unrequited love from fellow staffer K. C. Downing (Jessica Harper), and has an inspiration, inviting legendary swashbuckler Alan Swann (Peter O&apos;Toole) to appear on the show. As King Kaiser, star of the hit series, Joseph Bologna captures much of Sid Caesar&apos;s legendary physical &apos;presence&apos; and irreverence to authority. When threatened by gangsters over a &apos;too close to home&apos; series of parodies about crime boss Karl Rojeck (portrayed with brute menace by veteran actor Cameron Mitchell), Kaiser &apos;thumbs his nose&apos; at them, mimicking the gangster mercilessly. &quot;I&apos;ll KEEP doing it!&quot; he taunts. &quot;Why? Because it&apos;s FUNNY!&quot;\n\nThen there is Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s &apos;Alan Swann&apos;. With his own career a roller coaster ride of alcoholism, resulting in the near destruction of his health, no actor could have &apos;channeled&apos; Errol Flynn better. Just as Flynn, by the 1950s, was a nearly burned-out roué, his classic good looks long gone, O&apos;Toole&apos;s matinee-idol appearance, after years of self-abuse, had aged into a gaunt mask, making Benji Stone&apos;s film montage of &apos;classic&apos; clips more poignant. What Flynn still had, in abundance, were charm and a ready wit, and O&apos;Toole&apos;s &apos;Swann&apos; is so enchanting a personality that you can&apos;t help but love him, and root for him to succeed.\n\nFrom the opening nostalgic strains of Nat King Cole&apos;s rendition of &apos;Stardust&apos;, through Benjy&apos;s futile effort to attempt to keep Swann sober (Red Skelton loved to tell how he kept Flynn sober on his program...he emptied all of the actor&apos;s bottles of vodka, replacing it with water...and Flynn couldn&apos;t tell the difference!), to a riotous Swann dinner with Benjy&apos;s family, to the near-disastrous broadcast, with Swann developing stage fright, and Kaiser brawling with mob enforcers...MY FAVORITE YEAR has one glorious scene after another, each unforgettable!\n\nOne of the AFI&apos;s &apos;100 Greatest Film Comedies&apos;, MY FAVORITE YEAR will bring a tear to your eye, even as you laugh. It was a time of legends, and heroes who would live up to boyhood dreams.\n\nFilm comedy doesn&apos;t get any better than this!"

Until today he is the most legendary Austrian actor, no one will ever come close to him. He was an all-around talent.\n\nThis movie is quite funny, in all different kinds of aspects. It makes fun of the tourists, who crave Viennese and Austrian culture, it makes fun of our degeneration, our false past icons. It is critical to society in a very accessible and easy way.\n\nGunther Philipp is as excellent as always. But Peter is the real star in the film, the way he transforms into a woman is unmatched until this very day. He was sensual enough to do it in a respecitve style. I can only recommend this film. It is part of Austrian culture.",

      "reviewBody": "I really liked this movie a lot. Apart from a very brief nude scene and some strong (but appropriate in this situation) language at the end, this is an excellent movie for anyone about age 12 and up. It concerns a very nice young lady who is beloved by her small Bavarian town--until she makes the mistake of looking into the town&apos;s dark past. It starts innocently enough, as she is trying to write a paper about the town&apos;s heroes who resisted the Nazis. However, no one in town seems willing to talk about this &quot;glorious resistance&quot; and the town&apos;s archives are closed to her. Only after making herself a pain in the butt by suing the town repeatedly does she get ahold of records that prove little, if any resistance to the Nazis. In fact, many of the most beloved townsmen in fact HELPED and actively supported the Nazis.\n\nThe movie has a very odd artistic style. While it doesn&apos;t really detract from the film, you should see it to understand what I am talking about--it&apos;s quite unusual at times.\n\nWhat is so interesting and incredible about the movie was how everyone turned against her so quickly and violently. My only complaint was that it only talked about German reactions to their past. On a trip to Salzburg, Austria just a few years back, I noticed a beautiful monument to the Waffen SS (the group that manned the death squads and enacted the &quot;final solution&quot;) prominently displayed in the town&apos;s cemetery! Yes, this was the SAME cemetery in which the Von Trapp family hid in the movie The Sound of Music! If you are there some day, see it for yourself. It would be nice if someone confronted the apparently more open acceptance of their Nazi past here as well.",

It&apos;s not so obvious to recognize at first sight the Resnais touch. Maybe, the only possible approach of Resnais cinema is to distinguish in it a kind of deep exploration of relationship between humans. It&apos;s obvious in &apos;Mon oncle d&apos;Amerique&apos; but it seems that Resnais has devoted himself to reveal fundamental basis of relation/communication that can exist between two human beings, as humans being in space and time and their cultural background. And, with its no-narrative structure, Smoking/No smoking is a wonderful playground for analyzer Resnais, showing beyond laugh (Sabine Azema&apos;s nervous breakdown in Smoking is one of the funniest moment of cinema I&apos;ve enjoyed) and tears, silence and words, all the nuances that stem from our human part, regardless of what is due to facts and events.",

      "reviewBody": "Lynn has a problem.  Her father abused her, raped her, and beat her.  Lynn killed her father, was put in an asylum, and still believes her father to be alive.  Lynn escapes from asylum and heads on the highway to get away.  Thus is the first five minutes or so of Daddy&apos;s Deadly Darling(Pigs was the title of video I saw).  Then comes on one of the best and most ridiculous songs for a horror movie I&apos;ve seen in a long time, &quot;Somebody&apos;s waiting for you.&quot; I have to admit it is a pretty catchy tune.  The tune plays while Lynn drives away from her troubles till she comes to a small cafe in the middle of nowhere that has a position for employment open.  She secures her job here as a waitress and soon creates a bond with the cafe owner.  His name is Zambrini and he has a bunch of human flesh-eating hogs in the back.  Well, the story really gets bizarre here when we see Zambrini feed a freshly dug corpse to his livestock.  Lynn too seems to not haven gotten over her killing ways completely and the two work together going hog wild over their work.  This film is actually pretty good.  I mean it is not a a good movie, but it is a whole lot better than I expected and I think will exceed many of your expectations.  Marc Lawrence wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this film.  His daughter Toni plays Lynn.  Lawrence is able to create a very eerie feel to the film despite the total lack of logic that exists in the script.  Some of the scenes are dream-like and Lynn&apos;s nightmare scene is very powerful.  Lawrence also does a fine job acting in his professional low-key style.  His daughter isn&apos;t too bad either and let&apos;s just say she sure knows how to fill out a nightgown.  The deaths are not particularly plentiful or gruesome.  The rest of the acting is adequate with a couple of old ladies doing very well as neighbors complaining about the pigs next door.  Watch out for video misrepresentation:  one of the older women&apos;s names is Katherine Ross(she starred in one movie...this one!) but is given top billing on many videos to try and make you think this is the other Katherine Ross(The Graduate and The Legacy).  All in all a better than expected cinematic experience."

The young, but experienced British Capt. &apos;Tammy&apos; MacRoberts (Richard Burton) leads a limited number of inexperienced Australian troops in the defense of Tobruk, and uses raids during the night against Rommel forces to keep the balance between the strong German army and the reduced British-Australian forces, and MacRoberts&apos; troops are called &quot;The Desert Rats&quot;. &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; is a very realistic war movie, presenting strategies, battles, action scenes and a great duel between James Mason and Richard Burton. I am not sure whether Robert Wise used footage of some real battle scenes along the film, since the realism in the black and white photography is amazing and sometimes it looks like a documentary. There are also excellent lines between Richard Burton and James Mason, and Richard Burton and Robert Newton, in the role of the former teacher of MacRoberts. &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; is a highly recommended movie. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Ratos do Deserto&quot; (&quot;Desert Rats&quot;)",

Shishioh agrees to take part in a bloody fight against very weird opponents, arranged by TV producers out for sensation, but pretending they wish to help Shishioh and his wife. Ah! House Collapses!&quot; (the title of my DVD is House of Dead&quot; with a similar aversion to the word the&quot;) is a mixture of violent action, tragic drama and silly comedy - and not very good at any of these three. The fight between the two ladies on the bridge over electrified water is the best scene in a movie which hopes its cheap sadism (Shishioh crawls on his knees a lot and has blood all over his face most of the time, it seems) makes it easier to sit through, but I&apos;d rather recommend a dozen of good old Shaolin flicks instead.",

      "reviewBody": "OK first let&apos;s take a quick paragraph to analyze the history of successful comedy duos. There&apos;s Abbot &amp; Costello: a simple-minded clown (Costello) and his more-intelligent, straitlaced keeper (Abbott). Then there&apos;s Martin &amp; Lewis: another simple-minded clown (Lewis) and his more intelligent, suave keeper (Martin). Laurel &amp; Hardy: same formula. Mork &amp; Mindy, Laverne &amp; Shirley, Ren &amp; Stimpy, the list goes on. This successful pattern, with minor variations, repeats itself through the years. The clown is always kept in line by his/her more intelligent &amp; responsible keeper.\n\nHere we have a switcheroo. With Black &amp; Cera, the idiot (Jack Black) is in charge, while the smart one (Cera) is taking orders. The dynamic, especially with the extreme opposite personalities of Black &amp; Cera (outgoing vs. introverted), is a riot. Both are equally hilarious, and when they play off each other, it can be downright asphyxiating. I can&apos;t believe that this is the only film that features the two of them together like this, but that alone makes &quot;Year One&quot; worth running out to see.\n\nApparently critics haven&apos;t been kind to this movie. I&apos;ve read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and almost all of the negatives harp on how this doesn&apos;t stand up to writer/director Harold Ramis&apos;s past hits like Caddyshack, Vacation, Ghostbusters, etc. So what? Beethoven&apos;s 9th symphony may not have been as powerful as his 5th but we still like it.\n\n&quot;Year One&quot; delivers some great laughs, period. Beginning in what seems to be caveman times but quickly shifting into Old Testament Biblical times, it takes us on a wild romp through episodes of Cain &amp; Abel, Abraham &amp; Isaac, Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, and a particularly boy-hungry high priest played by Oliver Platt (you will NEVER recognize him). Irreverent, yes. Funny, yes. Offensive, I doubt it. Not any more than &quot;History of the World Part 1&quot; or &quot;Monty Python&apos;s Holy Grail&quot;. Definitely less biting than &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. But it does pack some bite.\n\nThe story isn&apos;t particularly new, but it serves its purpose to serve as a vehicle for some witty gags. And again I must harp on the Black-Cera delivery that makes it work. Jack Black plays an inept, loud-mouthed hunter who is constantly coming up with stupid ideas that get them in big trouble. Cera plays a meek gatherer who follows along with everything, quietly trying to explain the idiocy of it all while being ignored. The comedy flows so naturally you&apos;d think it was all improvised like in a Christopher Guest film. But I read in an interview that there wasn&apos;t much improv at all. Just a carefully planned script and excellent delivery.\n\nThe comedy is mostly family-friendly, but there are some adult innuendos and suggestive gags that may cross the line on occasion. If you &amp; your family feel comfortable laughing about circumcisions, then hey no problem.\n\nAlthough similar in theme, I would never compare &quot;Year One&quot; to &quot;History of the World&quot; or &quot;Holy Grail&quot;. Instead, the comedy reminds me more of &quot;The Rocker&quot; (with Rainn Wilson playing a washed-up 80s metal drummer trying to survive in a band today) or maybe even &quot;Men in Black&quot;, odd as that may seem.\n\nThere are rumors that Black &amp; Cera may have parts in Ramis&apos;s upcoming &quot;Ghostbusters III&quot;, and if so I&apos;ll definitely run out and see it. Until then, &quot;Year One&quot; remains your only chance to experience this one-of-a-kind matchup. Don&apos;t miss out."

      "name": "Good Spaghetti  and Chorizo Western co-produced between Spain and Italy , including a  sympathetic acting by the great Fernando Sancho",
      "reviewBody": "This is an entertaining Zapata Western that packs stirring adventures , shootouts , riding chases , vengeance , treason and is pretty amusing . Paella/Ravioli Western starred by Dakota Joe (Robert Hundar) , he is a feared gunslinger , dedicated to rent his revolver to kill . And for that reason arrives in a ranch at Mexican border , called by the landowner Don Carlos (Mirko Ellis) , a rich man follower of President Porfirio Diaz and who attacks , rampage and pillage the peasants . Dakota is hired to kill the town doctor (Felix Dafauce) , a good man who helps poor and unfortunate people . So Dakota Joe decides not to carry out the assignment , and plans with Pedro (Fernando Sancho), an outlaw who ravages and sacks stagecoach , now working &quot;honestly&quot; to the wealthy man , stealing all the money saved in the latter safe . Furthermore , Don Carlos&apos;s brother (Francisco Moran) uses an old law which allows owner his feudal right of first night on the bride (Marta Reves) called ¨Ius Primae Noctis¨ after the wedding celebration , then occurs crossfire and subsequent vendetta . Meanwhile , there takes place Mexican Revolution with two bands , Emilio Zapata&apos;s supporters and Porfirio Diaz&apos;s followers . Dakota , then , decides to help the Zapatistas .\n\nThis forgotten S.W. packs thrills , action , and lots of shots and gunplay . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing shoot&apos;em up , riding pursuits or stunts every few minutes . It deals with Dakota Joe , splendidly performed by the tall Robert Hundar , he is fine as the villain/hero of the story . Starring Robert Hundar is cool as a cold killer turned into a defender , he is enjoyable as the hero of the story . Hundar is very nice , he ravages the screen, he shoots , hits and runs , besides receives violent punches, kicks and wounds . The story is wrapped in the aura of Mexican revolution and an event on the metamorphosis of Dakota , a gunfighter turned into a hero . However , Fernando Sancho steals the spectacle as a likable Mexican with dark secrets , being magnificently interpreted by this veteran Spanish secondary actor . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation , with some looks that say it all , between Robert Hundar and his rival , the cruel owner well played by Mirko Ellis , also Spaghetti&apos;s ordinary . It&apos;s an exciting SW with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Robert Hundar and the enemy hoodlums , including a thrilling ending when happens a showdown at a saloon between Dakota Joe and a surprising contender . In addition , there appears usual secondaries of Italian/Spanish Western , including customary actors as the femme fatal Gloria Marin , Jose Canalejas , Antonio Mayans , Simon Arriaga , Raf Baldassarre , among others. There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design , a magnificent scenario on the villages , ranch , and barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and fine sets filmed in Almería, Andalucía , Spain . Evocative cinematography by Emilio Foriscot , showing marvelously the habitual Almeria outdoors . Angel Oliver supported by expert musician Coroliano Gori compose a vivid Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted , including an awesome leitmotif ; it&apos;s full of enjoyable sounds and rousing score . Definitely a worthy topic but, well done correctly interpreted and euro-western of the first period which, although far from the postulates leonianos .\n\nThis is one of the uncountable Western that the producers pioneers (Jose Gutierrez Maesso , Eduardo Manzanos Brochero) were joined by other Spanish producers, among which the brothers Productions Balcázar Balcázar or IFISA Iquino Ignacio Farres who established around Barcelona (Esplugues City, Casteldefells) and Huesca, especially to shoot the exteriors, a new stable center for filming westerns. The Argentinian , nationalized Spanish writer/filmmaker Tulio Demicheli so consistently mixed the good with the mediocre that it became quite impossible to know what to expect from him next . This is his second S.W. and is superior than former and subsequent entries , as he directed other Gazpacho Western as ¨Tequila¨, ¨Arriba Sabata¨ and ¨Gunmen of Rio Bravo¨. Demicheli had a long , prolific career , working from the 40s , he directed all kind of genres as drama as ¨Herida Luminosa¨ , Thriller as ¨Ricco¨ , adventures as ¨Son of Captain Blood¨, ¨First adventure¨ , Spy sub-genre as ¨¨Il Nostro Agente a Casablanca¨, ¨Dirty game in Panama¨ , ¨Misión Lisboa¨ , Giallo as ¨Coartada en Disco Rojo or Two faces or fear¨ , Horror as ¨Monstruos De Terror or Assignment Terror&quot; ¨ . His best movie was ¨Carmen of Ronda¨ with Sara Montiel . &quot;Dakota Joe&quot; USA title or &quot;Man and a Colt&quot; or ¨Un Hombre y Un Colt¨ resulted to be an above average Chorizo Western with an acceptable production , gorgeous cinematography , outstanding players and impressive musical score . Rating : 7 . Well worth watching .",

      "reviewBody": "If Dickens were with us today, he would delight in the stock shenanigans of Michael Milken and the outrageous dysfunction of the Osbourne family. Speculation and family chaos rule his `Nicholas Nickleby,&apos; directed on film by Douglas McGrath (`Emma&apos;) and starring Christopher Plummer as cold Uncle Ralph and Jim Broadbent as cruel Wackford Squeers.\n\nThe idyllic thatched cottage in Devonshire with its white smoke pluming to heaven contrasts sharply with the dark satanic mills of London spewing black smoke into every home and hovel.  The eponymous hero, played by Brit TV star Charlie Hunnam, travels both worlds to defend the honor of his sister, overcome the tyranny of his uncle (Plummer), and find love.  Along the way Broadbent&apos;s boarding-school proprietor, reflecting the workhouse slavery of 19th century England, helps his uncle sabotage Nickleby&apos;s spirit and endanger his best friend. But Nicholas also meets the delightful Cheeryble brothers, one of whom is Mike Leigh regular Timothy Spall in an uncharacteristically cheery role.\n\nEngland is lovingly represented in this film by a cinematography wedded to landscape like a Constable painting, gentlemen appearing as stately as in a Reynolds, and women appearing to be sitting for Gainesboro.  All seems well represented without being overdone or obvious.\n\nLike a good Dickens novel, the filmed `Nicholas Nickleby&apos; can&apos;t help but drive home lessons about honesty and family.  Reliance on both will bring happiness.  My only question is how did the Golden Globes ever nominate this as a comedy?"

I could swear I saw them in a couple of scenes. Actually I&apos;ve see more realistic puppets in shops in Prague.\n\n I&apos;m still trying to figure out why the bridgekeeper raised the bridge when the crowds were running over it. I guess Syd wanted the scenes of the cyclists going over the edge. Probably the best part.\n\n Not the worst, very far from the best but still a lot of fun to watch. MGM Midnight Movies has been putting these gems out on DVD this summer. I hope they keep it up, I&apos;m getting addicted to them."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a big fan of the first &apos;Maniac Cop&apos; movie, which has one of THE great exploitation taglines - &quot;You have the right to remain silent. Forever.&quot; Once again director William Lustig (&apos;Maniac&apos;, &apos;Vigilante&apos;) and writer/producer Larry Cohen (&apos;God Told Me To&apos;, &apos;Q The Winged Serpent&apos;) team up for this better than you&apos;d expect sequel. Robert Z&apos;Dar reprises his role as Matt Cordell the &quot;maniac cop&quot;, but like the original the supporting cast steals the movie from him, and in this case are the main reason to tune in. B-grade legend Bruce Campbell and Cohen regular Laurene Landon from the first movie put in an appearance, but the rest of the cast is new - Robert Davi (Bond baddie in &apos;License To Kill&apos;), and Claudia Christian (then best remembered for her bit in &apos;The Hidden&apos;, now for her recurring role in &apos;Babylon 5&apos;) as cops, and Leo Rossi (&apos;The Accused&apos;) as a creepy serial killer who befriends Cordell. Michael Lerner (&apos;Barton Fink&apos;) plays the Commissioner, Charles Napier (&apos;Supervixens&apos;) a TV host and Clarence Williams III (&apos;52 Pick-Up&apos;) a prisoner. Also keep an eye out for cameos by Lustig&apos;s pal Sam Raimi and Hispanic tough guy Danny Trejo (&apos;From Dusk Til Dawn&apos;). Many people, including William Lustig himself, think &apos;Maniac Cop 2&apos; is the best in the series, but I still prefer the original. This one&apos;s still great fun to watch and I highly recommended it to exploitation fans. The third movie in the series however was a major disappointment. You&apos;d be better off skipping it and watching Lustig and Cohen&apos;s overlooked &apos;Uncle Sam&apos; instead. It isn&apos;t their best work but it&apos;s a lot of fun."

In this film, because they are actually moving extras around there are clouds of dust everywhere. When the cannon fire, the black powder persists. The film has a real sense all through it of the fog of war.\n\nOn a personal note, I served in a Highland regiment, and it is a thrill to see a film where all of the kilts are not the same. The 92nd wear Gordon, Camerons wear Cameron of Erracht, and wonder of wonders both served at Waterloo.\n\nWhile the terrain shown in the film is nothing like the field, the strength of the film lies the in characterizations of Wellington and Napoleon. Both actors are at the top of their game, although some specifics are off (Wellington wasn&apos;t a aristocrat - more younger son of Anglo-Irish gentry).\n\nOne of the things that I like about the film is the way the director has cut several times to show Napoleon and Wellington react to the same information. It does a great job of contrasting the differences and similarities of the two leaders.\n\nVisually the film was breathtaking when I first say it in 1970, and it remains so.",

The direction was admittedly slow, nay stationary, and some of the actors did not help this much.\n\nWhat was not originally appreciated about this film is that the story of Joan of Arc is an exceptionally simple one, but yet cloaked in mystery.  Where the film failed was perhaps in not making us empathise with Joan, because we are given nothing of her motivations or her life before or after the seige at Orleans.  Compare this to the Besson film, that fails in my eyes for the exact opposite reason, it gives us too much!  I liked the film, but I liked it because although I couldn&apos;t empathise with a saint, I could empathise with a young woman who knew what she was doing, but didn&apos;t know where she was going.  What I shall always remember about this film is Seberg&apos;s transformation from trusting, coy and innocent to bewildered, bothered and (dare I say it) bewitched.  A great performance, and she really ought to have gone on to greater things."

Trouble is it does get tiresome. As Butch, he&apos;s sent over to Missing Persons Bureau from his former assignment to hopefully mellow out. Fat chance. Anyway, the screenplay weaves a number of missing person cases into the narrative, with the Bette Davis case being primary. An authoritative, no-nonsense Lewis Stone presides over the bureau that makes you believe he can handle the thuggish new guy. This was before Stone became enshrined in the Andy Hardy series. On the whole, Davis may get the billing but it&apos;s really O&apos;Brien&apos;s movie.\n\nWith the comically adept likes of Farrell, Jenkins, Herbert, and Donnelly, there&apos;re a number of chuckles. But what I really like is that bit of business at the coffee bar, where condiments slide back and forth like hockey pucks. I wonder if that was director Del Ruth, a generally underrated craftsman with occasional flair. Despite the title, there&apos;s no mystery but there is some suspense near the end. All in all, the 73-minutes is more like a fabric of characters colorfully interwoven."

      "reviewBody": "One of the two films made in 1956 about the woman who claimed to be Anastasia. The psychologically unstable Anna Anderson is played by Lili Palmer, who does a great job. Palmer&apos;s performance is more or less the only feature of this film The film never achieves a dramatic atmosphere;  the film only shows a great number of encounters with people who do or do not believe that the Anderson woman is Anastasia. Script writer Reinecker made be praised for not being tempted to introduce false romance (as the Ingrid Bergman version), on the other hand he could not make the script into a flowing story. Falk Harnack&apos;s direction is decent, but does not do much to overcome this main weakness of the script.\n\nThe film is interesting as a typical 50&apos;s event and can be regarded as an expression to the political situation between &quot;west&quot; and &quot;east&quot;. The film&apos;s sympathies are clearly on the side of the Anderson woman; this is accentuated by the fact that the discovery by a German newspaper that she was the Polish Franziska Schanzkowksa is without much ado dispensed with in a short and ridiculous scene. Since the DNA research in 1995 we definitely know what to think of  the Anderson woman and of all those Russian exiles who wanted to believe; I must say, knowing this makes the performance of Lili Palmer even more compelling viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "Granted, it&apos;s not perfect, and the idea is not 100% original (from a cinematic point of view) but one thing I love about Greg McLean&apos;s films is that he takes what are essentially Australian icons and flips them totally askew. For instance in Wolf Creek the films brutal killer - Mick Taylor is basically Mick Dundee turned psycho. And in Rogue, he yet again takes a well known Australian reptile and sets it loose on some unsuspecting tourists.\n\nThere&apos;s no denying McLean can shoot a beautiful movie, and some of the wonderful scenes of the Australian top-end are simply stunning. The characters all portray strong performances, especially when the pressure sets in and they begin to crack. McLean also does a good job at drip feeding the dread and teasing the audience with nothing but growls, grunts and slippery tails. It&apos;s an age old formula where directors don&apos;t show the full extent of the threat till the end - well, thankfully we don&apos;t have to wait that long, as when the croc does reveal itself - we see that it is frickin&apos;MASSIVE! And what&apos;s even more scary is that these thing&apos;s actually exist up there.\n\nThe croc itself is naturally CGI with some animatronics, and it&apos;s a relief to see that it looks &quot;real&quot;. The movement and animation is authentic and the sound design is also effective in giving the audience that jolted feeling a 3 tonne croc would give.\n\nIt&apos;s a tense, taught and well directed film, and the only gripe I have about it is that it seems a little short - maybe that was put down the fact that I was so immersed into the film? But it did feel a little short. It also lacked the brutal punch Wolf Creek gave us back in 2005, but never the less, it&apos;s a cute little Aussie horror thriller where McLean pays sound homage to classics like Jaws and Aliens. And it&apos;s also good to see more &quot;genre&quot; films like this coming out of Australia, and it&apos;s also good to know people like the Weinsteins and Warner Brothers are backing horror films from Australia for international releases and distribution.\n\nFor anyone into their Reptillian chills and thrills - I highly recommend ROGUE."

      "reviewBody": "Scientist Brody is working on a formula that will wipe out dog allergies, thus making dogs the most popular pets on earth.  When the dog agent protecting the house is kidnapped he is accidentally replaced by an untrained puppy Lou.  Lou is trained up with the help of Butch, Peeps, Ivy and Sam.  However with Mr Tinkles chasing the formula and Lou growing near to his family - can the formula be protected?\n\nThis had great potential - a good plot, a really strong cast and a good opportunity for children and adult jokes alike.  The plot delivers what it has - a little silly but quite clever in places - but the comedy is seriously lacking for adults.  For children there are some fart jokes and plenty of cat and dog slapstick but there are almost no jokes for adults that other films such as Shrek and Toy Story had in spades.\n\nGiven the cast this is very surprising - Jon Lovitz is a great voice but is hardly used at all, the character of Mr Tinkles could have been a great Dr Evil character, but even he is wasted.  This is a great shame as all good children&apos;s films need to have something for adults to enjoy again.  The great cast (Maguire, Baldwin, Clarke Duncan, Sarandon, Pantoliano, Charlton Heston, Lovitz) is a good draw for adults but having almost nothing to deliver for them is a big disappointment.  The only funny scenes are the ninja cats and a handful of others but mostly it&apos;s wasted.  The human actors are bland - Goldblum playing a scatty scientist? Surely not! That&apos;ll really push his barriers.\n\nOverall a disappointing film that&apos;ll please children but needed a lot more work to keep adults entertained."

The action is well done and the story is great, but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy (a demon raised by &quot;the good guys&quot;) just amazingly human, with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman, let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman&apos;s features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.\n\nOf course, there are a couple times when the special effects are a little weaker than you would hope, but it doesn&apos;t detract from the movie as a whole. For instance, in the final battle scene, there are a couple shots where the Hellboy character clearly appears to be GC. But the fight moves so fast that you don&apos;t have much time to focus on those shots before something else amazing happens.\n\nSee it. Love it.",

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;Urban Legend&quot; franchise returned with this straight-to-DVD installment but this time a supernatural spin was added to the series. While it&apos;s a decent idea, unfortunately, it didn&apos;t work. The main problem was that you never really got the sense that anything supernatural was going on to begin with. In the &quot;Final Destination&quot; films all the deaths were made to look like freak accidents yet you always knew that they weren&apos;t just accidents but that something supernatural was at work. It was the complete opposite in this movie. Despite constant reminders that the ghoulish Mary might be lurking about, most of the deaths still seemed like they really were just freak accidents. As if they weren&apos;t the result of something eerie but instead the result of extreme stupidity on the characters&apos; part. It didn&apos;t help that the majority of the victims were thin stereotypes (dumb jocks and their air-headed girlfriends). Basically, I never felt like Mary was much of a threat.\n\nStorywise, the film left a lot to be desired. For one, there&apos;s no relation between this film and the previous two UL films which was disappointing. Even &quot;Final Cut&quot;, which had a new story and a new set of characters was still somehow connected to the original &quot;Urban Legend&quot;. Also, the script for &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; felt disjointed at times. It&apos;s like they were more concerned with getting from Point A to Point B without much consideration to story. For example, a subplot early in the film where the jocks suspect a character of seeking revenge because of a prank just went nowhere and was forgotten after a few minutes. And then there are a bunch of seemingly important characters introduced during the first half of the film only to be forgotten during the second half, as if they never existed. On the acting side, the cast was barely okay. In the grand tradition of B-films, the heroine (Kate Mara) was the only one who showed any signs of promise with the rest of the cast displaying community theater performances. Especially Ed Marinaro who apparently never learned to act after his buff body and good looks faded away.\n\nThis movie was an obvious attempt at trying to revive the UL films by adding elements from such thrillers as &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Grudge&quot;. But taking ideas from other films shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise for this series since the first two &quot;Urban Legends&quot; were ripoffs of &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot; (what&apos;s next? An Urban Legend set in a hostel?). That wasn&apos;t entirely a bad thing since out of the dozens of &quot;Scream&quot; ripoffs, the UL films were the only good ones. They were fun and they added their own unique spin. Sadly, the same can&apos;t be said for &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; which does nothing fun or unique with the premise. And it certainly never comes close to being eerie or creepy like &quot;The Ring&quot; or &quot;The Grudge&quot; for the reasons mentioned above, the supernatural element wasn&apos;t established well enough and Mary is nowhere near as scary or even interesting as Samara or Kayako. She comes across more like a angry Goth girl with bad make-up. The film could have worked if they had a director who could have made Mary&apos;s scenes more chilling and atmospheric but instead they&apos;re just dull, uneventful and predictable. \n\nOne of the film&apos;s biggest offenses is that it completely betrays the title. The film has nothing to do with the actual legend of Bloody Mary or what she supposedly does when summoned. Rather than base the film on true Bloody Mary legends they come up with a lame story of their own involving a prom from 1969.\n\nI didn&apos;t hate the movie like I thought I would but I also didn&apos;t enjoy it as much as I should have. I will say that &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; is at least worth checking out for the spider scene alone. That was the film&apos;s one true highlight.",

      "reviewBody": "The Paperboy is one of those films that has a fine cast, a director with a track record (Lee Daniels, Oscar nominated for Precious) and an interesting plot, but will be rarely seen and largely forgotten by year&apos;s end. Sometimes there is no justice in the film world; just ask Ben Affleck about being overlooked by AMPAS as Best Director this year for Argo.\n\nIt&apos;s well performed, directed with few flaws and the cinematography hits the spot perfectly, but the trouble is, in terms of ratings, that it isn&apos;t easy to sell. Essentially, The Paperboy is a dialogue-driven film about an idealistic reporter, Ward Jansen (Mathew McConaughey), who returns to his hometown in the backwaters of the red-necked American south to investigate the conviction of a man on death row convicted of murdering a sheriff. When Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman), the infatuated pen-friend of Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack), the murderer in question, approaches Ward for help, he recruits his bother Jack (Zac Efron) and colleague Yardley (David Oyelowo) and sets about investigating ineptitude and corruption surrounding the case.\n\nIt isn&apos;t a pretty story, it doesn&apos;t race along at breakneck speed and it isn&apos;t a film that haunts the viewer long after the credits have rolled. It is, however, a thoroughly enjoyable tale that meanders through some murky and terrible swamps, both literal and metaphorical, and will satisfy those with a penchant for the underbelly of society.\n\nBased on a true story and one from the official selection for Cannes 2012, The Paperboy is a dark story that at times is very unpleasant. It goes to places you almost certainly want to avoid in your life. There are no sweet and lovely two-dimensional characters here but &apos;regular Joes&apos; with twists in their psyches and the relationships between the principal four keeps us on our toes. Each has secrets or sides to their characters they try to hide and each is capable of damaging another willfully and yielding or ignoring their conscience after the event in their own self-harming manner.\n\nEfron shows signs of shaking off his teenybopper roots and it is encouraging to see him take a long and effective step away from such pulp as last year&apos;s predictable The Lucky One. At last we see something of a character developing from him, and Jack&apos;s relationship with the maid, Anita (Macy Gray), who also narrates much of the story, gives a hint of warmth to an otherwise cold and twisted collection of characters.\n\nBoth McConaughey and Kidman stepped away from the &apos;beautiful&apos; roles sometime ago, though there is still a feeling of them playing &apos;against type&apos; here, which isn&apos;t fair as both are very fine actors with some startling performances in recent years. Here they allow themselves to be engulfed by the perversions of their roles and are eminently watchable though you wouldn&apos;t much &apos;alone time&apos; with either of them. Gray is overlooked largely and, though her Anita is supposed to be the all-seeing character that fills in the gaps for us, she feel inconsequential much of the time.\n\nIt is Cusack that startles most of all here. He often frustrates as a fine actor in turkeys (Hot Tub Time Machine, The Raven) and then blindsides us with another performance we&apos;ve been desperately hoping for. As Hilary he initially causes reserved sympathy from us as he stumbles into the scene disheveled and emotionally crushed. We can almost smell the grease in his hair and his fetid breath and recoil at the thought of Charlotte sharing anything more than a letter with him. But he evolves and repulses as The Paperboy unfolds in a performance every bit the antitheses of his signature role, Martin Q. Blank, but equally memorable. Whilst an unpleasant character with whom to share time, the performance is absorbing. Just please don&apos;t let this be the last time we enjoy Cusack for another five years.\n\nDaniels has crafted a film of relationships with confused issues. Life isn&apos;t always clear-cut and often it is just plain dirty. Though less successful, financially, than Precious, The Paperboy is a far more mature film with a great deal more flare. Although Daniels hasn&apos;t had the courage to shoot it entirely in the style of the period, there are enough references to the late sixties and seventies with split screens and flares to transport us back the era of segregation and Tarantino&apos;s favourite word.\n\nIt won&apos;t last long at the box office, but The Paperboy is a DVD treat for an evening that calls for something more than schmaltz or easy laughs and requires some emotional investment.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

      "reviewBody": "By the time Yuppi Du was released in 1975, Adriano Celentano was already a household name, famous for his endlessly popular songs and film roles. Yuppi Du, however, was a bit of a gamble, given he would fill all the important positions himself, playing the lead, directing, writing, producing, editing and scoring. The gamble paid off when the film was accepted in competition at the Cannes Film Festival (where it won a quite fitting award for the music) and has since become a cult classic in Italy (the special screening at the 2008 Venice Film Festival was as hugely anticipated as the world premiere of Burn After Reading).\n\nAppropriately enough, considering its recent &quot;revival&quot;, the film takes place in Venice, where people are upset over a series of fatal accidents that occur in unsecured work places at the docks. Among those who work there - for a ridiculous salary, too - is Felice Della Pietà (Celentano), who lives happily with his wife Adelaide (Claudia Mori, the singer&apos;s spouse in real life) and his daughter while trying to deal with the difficult conditions he and his friends find themselves in. Everything is turned upside down, though, when he discovers his past love Silvia (Charlotte Rampling), whom everyone believed to be dead, didn&apos;t commit suicide but actually ran off to Milan with someone else. As things get more complicated for Felice, both at home and at work, he and the others can think of no other way to express their frustrations but through music.\n\nA musical with a social message is a rare thing, and it is to Celentano&apos;s credit that he had the guts to go all the way with his ambitious project. The big surprise is that the film works almost perfectly, despite jumping from one genre to another every five minutes: first there&apos;s the social realism, then we get a bit of farce (Felice&apos;s reaction to Silvia&apos;s return), then some more elegiac scenes (courtesy of Venice&apos;s lagoon landscape) which go hand in hand with the more colorful musical numbers (the titular song especially). Not counting an unwelcome horror-like digression in the form of an unsettling rape scene, the genre blend makes for a fascinating collection of moments that make up for a not-so-brilliant plot and the occasional lack of proper acting skills (Celentano is better as a singer, but he isn&apos;t bad here, particularly when he squares off with Rampling).\n\nMore than anything, Yuppi Du is driven by its director&apos;s enthusiasm and energy: it&apos;s a tribute to the beauty of nature and the endurance of the human race, both of which are exemplified by some whimsically original musical acts. Plus, musicals are a rare breed outside the US: when one has the courage to attempt something similar in Europe, it&apos;s hard not to show some sympathy for the achievement.",

I think his name would have been listed in the credits but I could never find it. A must rent for the gang to enjoy most on any movie night. I am a big fan of fan Bill Paxton and I love him in this movie. I am surprised that he has not gotten more roles like this. This movie was a all-star cast of unknowns at the time, but as history has bore out, they are all stars in their own right. I have never been to Arizona to where this movie was filmed, but I am planning a vacation there to see where they filmed this movie soon. Anthony Geary was amazing also. Just love this flick so very much.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival last night. I&apos;m not a natural fan of Loach&apos;s work, although grew a little warmer to it after Sweet Sixteen.\n\nWhat he&apos;s made here though is a believable, warming love-story. Aside from &apos;location-spotting&apos; the Glasgow geography, there was a feeling throughout the film that&apos;s difficult to pin down (or articulate!); just a kind of &quot;yeah, that&apos;s right, these people and these feelings are real&quot;.\n\nLead-wise, a great line up, Atta Yaqub plays a quiet Casim, and Eva Birthistle a brilliant but natural Roisin - there&apos;s nothing that stops you believing that this is a couple in love.\n\nAs for the rest of them - some excellent characters and some good acting. One criticism is Loach&apos;s practice of using non-actors - sometimes this leads to an almost TOO natural delivery of the script. The strength of the whole cast comes through though, and there&apos;s certainly no feeling of any tokenism or stereotype characters.\n\nOne actor who doesn&apos;t appear to have had much notice in any write-ups I&apos;ve seen is Shabana Bakhsh, who plays Tahara Khan, Casim&apos;s youngest sister. She&apos;s fantastic. Again, falls a little foul of sometimes sounding overly natural... but what a star though. She was very believable as the rebellious, starting to get politically active, younger sister.\n\nAll-in-all, a great film, worth seeing. I think it&apos;s out on general release sometime in the early autumn - well worth the ticket."

      "reviewBody": "Some people reviewing this film have been complaining everything from the script to the actual film itself but I wonder how many films they have seen that live to their high expectations? This lowbudget supernatural horror film was a big surprise for me because I never heard about it before nor have I met anyone who have seen it.\n\nThe story about demon hunter Cathal(James Nesbitt) using irish &quot;Pikey&quot; or traveller/gypsy magic in order to snare a demon beast is slightly different from similar stories in the same genre. The hunt is not as easy as its seems and some people have a hidden agenda....\n\nUsing very ordinary locations, in this case, a rundown apartment complex in Edinburgh poses it challenges. A type of location used in many other films like Fish Tank (2009), All or Nothing (2002), or A Taste of Honey (1961)etc.\n\nHow to make such usual, cliché ridden location into something more menacing, chilling, more resembling the Gothic horror environment in an old abandoned castle for example? Director Colm McCarthy has the answer by using very little lighting, editing and very sparse use of CGI, makeup etc he creates a most chilling atmosphere out of a normal housing project.\n\nHowever, being a lowbudget means that whatever SFX is used is not as good as bigger budget movie but Colm McCarthy does a very good job with it.\n\nStory itself is reminiscent of some of Clive Barkers films, such as Lord of Illusions (1995), Hellraiser (1987), Nightbreed (1990). Mix this with irish traveller/gypsy magic and that type of culture (watch Ian Palmers doc Knuckle)and add some HP Lovecraft, especially themes from The Dunwich Horror and you will get what Outcast (2010)is about.\n\nThe acting is very good, James Nesbitts obsessed demonhunter Cathal, Kate Dickies Mary who has done a lot great performances in films like Red Road (2006) now mostly famous from Game of Thrones is just excellent.\n\nThe new faces for me are Hanna Stanbridge, Niall Bruton who are very good playing two teenagers thrust into a problematic situation that none of them seem to understand.\n\nSo, future viewers that like supernatural horror films, and don&apos;t mind lowbudget flaws, watch this film with a different approach to witchcraft, demons and sorcery."

Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourists camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each persons wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorships control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her countrys ruin, and where Rauls reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castros supporters and dissidents, young and old none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.",

At the film there are action, adventures, thrills, sadism and atmospheric outdoors filmed in London . Produced , as always, in average budget by Harry Allan Towers and also written under pseudonym of Peter Breck . Christopher Lee returns in this second chapter as the evil powerful Fu Manchu , the ominous genius who doesn&apos;t give up easily, and is out to destroy world or bent on conquering it . This time has designed a fantastic scheme , kidnapping scientific&apos;s daughters (Marie Versini , Carole Gray , among others) forcing them to develop a deadly ray gun . The beautiful girls are tortured by Fumanchu and his nasty daughter . Inspector Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard Nayland is his perennial adversary and arch-nemesis , he takes the center of attention when undergoes the dangerous mission. When Nayland Smith is assigned the case along with his assistant Dr. Petrie(Howard Marion Crawford) go into the action . Nayland Smith enlists the help a German scientist named Franz (Heinz Drache) against evil-doer emperor Fu.\n\nThis is a bizarre blending of thriller , suspense , action , intrigue and fantastic adventure . This exciting , diverting picture is full of Chinese killers, British adventurers , abducted scientists and megalomaniac villains . Christopher Lee with his usual stoic acting as Fu displays efficiently his abilities and killing mercilessly people . Fine 1920s atmosphere with good sets and old vehicles . Not as nice as ¨Face of Fumanchu¨-also by Don Sharp- still amusing and entertaining. Good performance by Douglas Wilmer as Nyland Smith who in previous and subsequent episodes was interpreted by Nigel Green , and Richard Greene , as always supported by Dr. Petri from ministry of Interior played by Howard Marion Crawford . The villain T Sai Chin stand out as Fu Manchu&apos;s daughter . International and cosmopolitan cast formed by European actors from diverse countries as British as Douglas Wilmer ,Rupert Davies , Carole Gray ; German as Heinz Drache , Haralz Leipnitz ; French as Marie Versini , Roger Hanin ; Chinese as Eric Young and Burt Kwouk who played the Peter Sellers&apos;s contender in Pink Panther series.\n\nThe best installments were ¨Face of Fu Manchu(1965, Don Sharp)¨, and ¨Brides of Fu Manchu( 1966, Don Sharp)¨ , followed by the inferior ¨Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967 by Jeremy Summers ) and most critics felt the outing ¨Blood of Fumanchu¨ was one of the weakest entries along with ¨The castle of Fu Manchu¨, both of them directed by Jess Frank with similar casting , plenty of stock-shots and a Z-series style.

It is blessed with a great cast without a dud performance between them. Particularly worthy of mention are the two wonderful child actors Jonathan Mason and Hester Odgers as well as a charming performance from Peter O&apos;Toole as the crusty Duke who thankfully does not turn out to be the cliché villain that he initially appears. Along with gorgeous photography by Howard Atherton and a script by director Charles Sturridge that mixes enough grit into the story to stop it from becoming too twee, this truly great family film should have become better known than it is. For those of us that have been lucky to discover it, it is an instant classic.",

Maybe it helped because I like both Michael Paré (Eddie and the Cruisers) and Mariel Hemingway (Star 80) but maybe anyone could have acted out the parts and I would have still enjoyed Bad Moon anyway.\n\nIf you are looking for modern-day, high dollar movie with tons of CGI effects - then this movie may not be for you. Bad Moon uses &quot;old school&quot; special effects that I still love to this very day.\n\nThis is one of those movies I would enjoy watching again on a dark, rainy night with popcorn in hand.\n\n9.5/10",

      "name": "Scores and celebrates an impossibly new beginning for Football/Soccer Films",
      "reviewBody": "Until recently in history, whenever the world of film and the world of football combined, the results had often been negligible. With the GOAL! trilogy, a new precedent has been set for not only the genre, but also for the global sport itself, in terms of its plausibility in film towards its millions of demanding fans worldwide.\n\nWhat this film does on the base level is to authentically present the game in high quality realism on the silver screen. However, that alone does not lend the film its credo. What makes it stand as the definitive standard bearer for films of football (given how every other sport especially American ones have managed to succeed filmwise- Bull Durham, Space Jam, Mighty Ducks, Remembering the Titans, etc) is that it carries many thematic layers on its back, pushes the frontiers of the genre with depth in the storyline, and finally aces in delivering a film that merges drama with sport, hype and overall verisimilitude in all content elements.\n\nObviously, every critic knows that the methodology of such a delivery is that it requires realism, and in cinematography especially- exactly what the film provides, and as a result gives it that definitive edge. Soccer films have never been entirely authentic, due to factors as diverse as action mapping, as well as dramatic scope. Furthermore, fans of the sport knew that nothing in cinema could ever approximate the sheer unscriptable drama of the actual game. Until GOAL! came along. When FIFA commissioned and granted the rights for the film to Danny Cannon, the air of realism was set in motion already, because albeit being fictional, it carries the authority of the universal game as fans know it because of its simulated parallels- real clubs, real superstars like Zidane, Raul, Shearer, etc, and realities of the game&apos;s actual hierarchies and bureaucracies have been surmised- reserves, leagues, scouts, agents and pressures.\n\nAG Salomon/Adidas may have pumped advertising dollar into this film for placement of their teams (Newcastle United, Real Madrid) and sponsored players for marketing, but in a sense, when the result is this authentic, can you blame the corporations for input? In fact, fans might even have to thank them for producing what can be the first high profile and quality football film on record. Just recall the maudlin world of football film until the recent revival of films of the genre, which incidentally mirror the revolution of football and its branding that began in the 1990s and the likes of superstars like Beckham. In recent years, this revival has seen film entries usher in on the commercial success of football, from 1996&apos;s &apos;Fever Pitch&apos; to 2002&apos;s Bend it like Beckham, but never has a film about the game itself been done the way it has been done here, in such centrality.\n\nIn fact, the very dearth of such films is an understatement and may well be the fuel for the GOAL! trilogy&apos;s impending success. Even football legend PELE alluded to the paucity of football films- or at least those of the simple concept explaining structures of wealth, class and the disparities of rich and poor in congruence with football. The plot by Butchart and Jeffries in this film stands out because of this - featuring the barrios of S.America; the institution of organized football religion in England, and a rag to riches drama, where Becker&apos;s character combines innocence and disappointments with success and &apos;aspiracion&apos; in true underdog fantasy. The script is far from genius but it has depth- genuine troughs (poverty, death, rejection) and hurdles- competition, adaption and temptation (the clubbing scenes were almost a revealingly accurate précis given footballers&apos; reputations in Europe). In fact, perhaps the only inaccurate part was about how Becker signed without a work permit and contract given he had to have been playing in at least 70% of all matches with his International side. Nonetheless, the film manages at the same time to convey the global scale of this billion dollar world obsession with the fantasy without compromising the sheer magnitude, and challenges of it all. Throw in all the other elements ranging from romance with Anna Friel&apos;s pragmatic nurse character to the gamut of football archetypes (Nivola as the playboy with conscience, Iures as the stoic gaffer, Dillane as the gentlemanly scout, the mercenary agents, an even a Souness-like hardman), on top of the fact that footage of actual matches in England has been seamlessly edited in, and you can see why the film accounts for a thorough representation of the sport. Perhaps even most exciting of all, the film shows behind the scenes footage of the teams and stars- training, grounds, gyms, dressing rooms, city streets, pubs, Toon Geordies.\n\nHow many people remember a football film that was done this way? More often than not football films have been towed by comedy or played side appendage to broader issues. From Thorold Dickinson&apos;s Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939) about crime, to biopics like Yesterday&apos;s Hero (1979), or Gregory&apos;s Girl (1981) about gender, or even Eran Riklis&apos;s Cup Final (1991) about the PLO in war, most films have broader issues. The rest survive on humour, Mike Bassett (2001), being the typical example. GOAL! scores and sets the precedent for the genre from now on. In fact, there has been a rush of football films since, well accounted for at Cannes or the Berlinale festival, and probably well into World Cup 2006.\n\nFilms at Cannes included &apos;The Longest Penalty in the World&apos; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet Get Married&quot; - a strained marriage between a Barcelona fan and a Real Madrid fan while Berlinale had &apos;Offside&apos; an Iranian film. The market for soccer films has always been there, its just a case of whether filmmakers could break the deadlock with quality and authenticity, and GOAL! could well be the catalyst for the floodgates to open.\n\nBy Stephen Thanabalan",

Instead, this is a boring and predictable teen drama that rips off everything from Hannah Montana to Earth to Echo. So you make a property based on an old cartoon and toy line and then proceed to alienate any viewers who might want to check it out for nostalgia&apos;s sake. On top of that, your movie kinda blows anyway so you can forget adding any new fans. The songs suck, the actors are forgettable, and the script doesn&apos;t have a single original idea. There&apos;s also this annoying YouTube crap that keeps popping up. I get it. You&apos;re trying to make a Jem for the generation that has such a thing as &quot;YouTube popular.&quot; That&apos;s an idea that should have been killed in any of the pre-production meetings they undoubtedly had before this thing was made. It&apos;s a misfire from start to finish. It likely won&apos;t appeal to any of the fans of the original Jem and I can&apos;t imagine it will hold much appeal to any younger fans, excepting those who might be crushing on a couple of the actors.",

      "reviewBody": "After their disastrous second outing, few people had faith in the third part, but Dark of the Moon rights a lot of the narrative faults and feels like the sequel the first film deserved.\n\nA despondent Sam finds himself out of the limelight as the Decepticon threat appears to have lessened, Mikaela and Bumblebee have left him and he struggles to find a job and direction in life. But when Optimus Prime learns that humanity had found a vital Autobot ship crashed on the Moon, he rescues Sentinel Prime from the wreck, just when the Decepticons return with a plan to restore their homeworld of Cybertron.\n\nWatching Dark of the Moon feels like an endurance test by the time it finishes, this is due to a ridiculously drawn out battle set in Chicago for the climax. While it makes up for Revenge of the Fallen&apos;s terribly underwhelming finale, it does become a blur of insignificance after a while because there&apos;s simply too much happening! But if there is one thing done right this time is a correct use of characters. A lot of the ludicrous padding and fluff from RotF is completely missing; our human characters are involved but not excessively (ie. Sam&apos;s parents hardly feature at all!) and let&apos;s say this film provides us with humans who aren&apos;t noble and just. There&apos;s a lot more of the Transformers too (you would hope so) and it feels like they have a lot more respect shown to them now. Decepticons genuinely appear threatening and the Autobots are shown to have personalities again, continuing from the first film&apos;s groundwork (a scene with a silent, brooding Optimus-in-truck-mode is a favourite). The action is off the rails too. More in keeping with the original film we see them transform during battles.\n\nThere are some deeply unsettling scenes too. The setup involves assassinations against humans who knew about the mission to the Moon, executed by Decepticon Laserbeak (great to see him too), one where he infiltrates a family&apos;s house by pretending to be a friendly Autobot playing with their daughter. Woah, woah! RotF was too cheesy, but this is really dark all of a sudden!\n\nAs a fan of the Transformer characters, this film sees a lot of deaths. Some are most unforgivable. We haven&apos;t seen this many prominent robot deaths since the slaughter that was the 1986 Transformers: The Movie! The only other gripe I mostly have about this film asides deaths and a bloated finale is Carly, Sam&apos;s new love interest (the forgettable Rosie-Huntington Whitely) who is given things to do thanks to the plot, but is far less notable than Fox&apos;s Mikaela (I cannot believe I just wrote that) but I do believe the film would be stronger without a love interest. But it is Michael Bay, we need a girl for those slow-mo shots.\n\nIt is a vast, vast improvement and a faithful sequel to the 2007 film. It is too long, and it does make some unforgivable decisions regarding Transformer characters, so it feels less perfect in those regards. It is still a fun film though.",

If you want to see what happens with the dog they found in the last movie and see what happens if Plop and the others do in the human world then you MUST (!) see this timeless classic... The music-lovers (especially violin-lovers) will also enjoy this masterpiece. Plop is played wonderfully. Kwebbel&apos;s performance has been better in films a long time ago, but what did you expect? Too bad Samson couldn&apos;t join them. My little sister also liked this movie, although she was sometimes afraid of the creepy characters that appeared now and then.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve got a particular interest in low budget film making, especially if it deals with &quot;the fantastic&quot;, horror or otherwise, so I was looking forward to seeing &apos;Desecration&apos;. Some of the greatest horror movies of all time have been low budget and shot guerrilla style - &apos;Carnival Of Souls&apos;, &apos;Night Of The Living Dead&apos;, &apos;The Last House On The Left&apos;, &apos;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&apos;, and &apos;Eraserhead&apos; all immediately spring to mind - and directors like Jess Franco and Coffin Joe have made some amazingly imaginative and original movies on very little money. Low budget film making can be a real acid test for an aspiring director. Unfortunately going by &apos;Desecration&apos; Dante Tomaselli fails that test. This is just a lousy movie anyway you look at it. Much is made of the &quot;miniscule&quot; budget. I&apos;m sorry but $150,000 is far from miniscule! Robert Rodriguez&apos;s brilliant action movie &apos;El Mariachi&apos; only cost $7,000! Closer to home Darren Aronofsky&apos;s &apos;Pi&apos; was released the year before this and that only cost $60,000. Now &apos;Pi&apos; isn&apos;t technically a horror movie true, but it&apos;s much more original and disturbing than &apos;Desecration&apos;, it looks brilliant visually and it features some great acting to boot. So what gives? I haven&apos;t seen Tomaselli&apos;s subsequent movie &apos;Horror&apos;. Maybe I&apos;m wrong and he really does have talent and that movie will blow my mind, but honestly, after snoozing through &apos;Desecration&apos; I&apos;m in no hurry to find out!"

      "reviewBody": "If &quot;Goofy&quot; had a scale from 1-10, this would be about a 8.5.\n\nIt&apos;s a Scienece Fiction, or roughly Science Fiction, bit about a time machine invented by a Nazi.\n\nIt starts off okay, and when you watch how it begins, you will get a big thrill, because you will recognize a later classic for using much of what you see here. If you see it, you&apos;ll instantly know the name of the satire that uses much of the early part of this movie.\n\nThere are a few things to like. The girl with the legs at the start vanishes for a while, but then you get to see her again.\n\nWe have the &quot;reporter and cop friend&quot; cliché, which is sometimes not too bad, depending on how much &quot;atmosphere&quot; you get. This movie does give a pretty good amount of atmosphere for the few special effects it has.\n\nMost of the early sixties and late fifties science fiction has good atmosphere, and a camaraderie among local folk. We get that here. What we don&apos;t get are good lines. These movies aren&apos;t usually this &quot;corny&quot;. And the acting usually isn&apos;t this poor, either. I am usually not that particular with &quot;acting&quot;, but these actors cross the line. They are truly just reading lines. Ironically, the best acting comes from the hot babes. The men are the dweebs here.\n\nThe atmosphere would usually let me forgive the corny writing and acting, but the second half just had too many &quot;horrible&quot; scenes. The worst one is where a girl helps the heroine escape, and the heroine just stands and watches while the girl who helps her is strangled to death. No explanation can cover this. Then there is the Hitler&apos;s scientist, whose lines are the most &quot;expository&quot; you will ever see on celluloid.\n\nNot the worst, by far, but it leaves you with a feeling that even for a low budget horror, it should have been much better.",

This dust gives the animals the ability to speak to humans for 3 days, but the animals are expressly forbidden to speak to any humans during that time. Why would he do this? Just to have a brief conversation with animals once a year? Why would he allow them to speak for 3 days, is that just the smallest amount of dust he could use? The animals can already communicate with each other fine. This isn&apos;t a gift; it is a curse. Being given a gift whose only purpose is prohibited from being used...that is torture.\n\nGoing on with the premise, the villain, Aunt Agnes, wants Billy to live with her instead of his uncle. She wants Billy to live with her because... she thinks he would make Christmas more fun.\n\nThere are other villains who are just bullies. Bullies who love to make fun of mute children. There isn&apos;t anything more to their characters, they are just the worst kids.\n\nOh, and Annabelle is a cow that wants to be one of Santa&apos;s reindeer. The payoff for that has an additional twist that makes no sense, but since this world makes no sense, I guess it works.\n\nThe rest of the movie is very by the numbers straight to video animated kids&apos; movie. The voice acting is all good and the animation is fine. I&apos;m an easy mark for this animation style. And I am a sucker for some of these Christmas clichés.\n\nNot a perfect Christmas, but also not a complete barn fire.",

The joyous innocence, hope and longings of younger children celebrating the season set off against the fault lines of teenage self pre-occupation, cynicism and alienation... the ultimate triumph of love and humanity that is the true spirit of Christmas. \n\nExpect this movie to be a staple of families with young children for many a Christmas season in the years ahead. Plan on lot&apos;s of laughter and moist eye at the end for the redemption and reconciliation of all by the end of the movie.",

It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation – life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even – horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now&apos;s your chance to – uh, well, we warned you&quot;. -Edward Van Sloan.\n\nAlthough this movie does not shock or thrill, it fascinates. The movie&apos;s cast is well worth repeating, Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, ETC. The movie contains obvious hints to German Expressionism, as the production team was inspired by films like Nosferatu, or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The Gothic style fits the setting and the sets work beautifully. This movie would forever solidify Frankenstein in media and launched Boris Karloff into stardom. Although there is no musical score,it still works well without it as the horrifying scenes are much more emphasized than if it had music. All in all, this is a movie everyone should see, if you haven&apos;t seen it, go ahead and view this masterpiece. If you have seen it, now is the time for you to watch it again. &quot;However, if you do not care to put your nerves in such a strain, now&apos;s your chance to-uh, well, we warned you&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I just finished watching this on TV. The story is about several weeks in the lives of three bothers. Circumstances (what they are is unimportant) have caused the two younger bachelor brothers to move in with their older married brother and his family. The script explores the relationships between three loving Irish Catholic American brothers, each with a distinctive personality, and the relationships each has with the women in their lives. It&apos;s about real love and romance (not the sappy romantic comedy type), fears of commitment, and the twists and turns these men go through in dealing with that aspect of their lives. \n\nTheir Catholicism has a lot to do with the story. At one point Patrick says to his Jewish girl friend, &quot;I go to Church every week; you go to Temple only once or twice a year.&quot; She replies, &quot;Yes, but your religion is crazy.&quot; Although the most religious of the three, Patrick, goes against the Church&apos;s teachings in that he uses condoms; but, he worries about going to Hell should he commit other serious sin. \n\nMarriage to all of them means a life-long commitment. Their mother&apos;s life set the standard for them. She had lived 35 years in a forced, loveless marriage until her husband passed away. That freed her to go to the man she had been in love with when circumstances caused her to marry the boys&apos; father. Abortion was out of the question, as was divorce.\n\nEd Burns is credited with writing and directing the film and he also is very credible as the middle brother. While the entire cast made their characters seem real, the actor who in my mind stood out is Mike McGlone, who plays Patrick, the youngest brother who has a kind of altar boy personality. Perhaps Ed Burns&apos; choice of camera angles gets some of the credit for making his performance particularly memorable, but McGlone brought something special to that part.",

Besides, it&apos;s difficult to believe someone would put such a sign and thus indicate there is SOMEONE in there.&quot; In Russia EVERYTHING is believable, that&apos;s what Nikita Mikhalkov wants to say. This movie is a fiction, don&apos;t forget it! But all the stories told in it are possible and the way of thinking of these people may be hard to understand, but it&apos;s true. This film is a cut through the Russian Soul and it&apos;s great.",

      "reviewBody": "In &amp; out of prison, Stan &amp; Ollie just can&apos;t seem to stay out of trouble.\n\n&quot;PARDON US&quot; was the Boys&apos; first starring feature film. Rather disjointed and poorly edited, it plays more like a few of their short subjects strung together. However, the Boys never falter and they deliver a film whose parts are greater than its whole.\n\nThe film was meant to be a spoof of MGM&apos;s popular THE BIG HOUSE (1930) and it helps to have seen that earlier movie to fully appreciate this one. Many of the standard conventions of the typical prison film are mocked here: the understanding&apos; warden, the dangerous convict cell mate, the confinement in Solitary, the escape chased by bloodhounds, the prison riot.\n\nA few comedy pieces in particular stand out: Stan&apos;s loose tooth; Ollie in the dentist&apos;s chair; the Boys trying to settle into the constricted confines of an upper bunk. James Finlayson, Stan &amp; Ollie&apos;s old nemesis, makes the most of his one scene as the prison schoolteacher driven to despair by the Boys&apos; good-natured idiocy.\n\nWalter Long is lots of fun as the Tiger, the meanest convict in the prison (Boris Karloff played the part for the French language version). Movie mavens will spot an uncredited Charlie Hall as the dental assistant.\n\nAn added delight is Babe Hardy&apos;s rendition of Lazy Moon,&apos; one of the decade&apos;s finest film songs. Ollie had a warm, evocative voice, full of feeling and emotion. Here, backed by the magnificent Hall Johnson Choir, his song reaches out of the screen and down the decades to touch the hearts of the audience.",

      "reviewBody": "The English language version of this movie is &quot;Peace Will Win.&quot; It was black and white, released on 16mm. I got a copy from the woods of North Idaho, of all places.\n\nJoris Ivens is, in my opinion, the &quot;Godfather of independent political film.&quot; If you are not familiar with him, then do a bit of net research to find his filmography etc. My introduction to his work was this film. As an indymedia activist, I was surprised that I had not previously know of him, but he is little known in the US.\n\n&quot;Peace Will Win&quot; documents a world peace congress held in 1950. The world wanted peace, but there was the US war against Korea going on, and at the conference a report was presented that detailed the US use of a new horrible weapon, the Napalm Bomb. This was only 5 years after the US had used the Atom Bomb on Japan. The film has footage of destroyed Korean cities, dead and wounded women and children. I have never seen footage of the destruction of Korea from any other source.\n\nThis film is considered one of Iven&apos;s less important works, so it has not been shown--to my knowledge--anywhere for a long time, not even in Joris Ivens festivals. But for Americans, it is an important film, because it is our government that the film targets, and other than the book &quot;Hidden History of the Korean War,&quot; there isn&apos;t too much out there except the official US government line on this conflict from half a century ago. Now that the US is again calling North Korea one the the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; nations, it seems important to examine the history of this period to understand the present. This film, with its contrary view of that period, is very useful in that regard.\n\nNever got the money to digitize the entire 16min 50-something minute movie, but I made a 6 minute &quot;trailer&quot; of sorts of &quot;Peace Will Win&quot; and will post it on the PepperSpray site so that others can get a sense of what it and Joris Ivens are all about. To watch the trailer, go to www.peppersprayproductions.org, then to videos.\n\nRandy Rowland, pepperspray@mac.com"

      "name": "Shyamalan&apos;s most under-appreciated film",
      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been more shocked by how much I liked a film. I had very low expectations when I decided to watch &quot;The Village,&quot; because I knew how much critics had panned it. I&apos;m not saying that I regard the consensus of the critics as sacrosanct. But the movies I love are rarely ones that have earned critical scorn, so by the law of probability I doubted that this one would be any good. Besides, I had noticed a steadily downward slope in the quality of M. Night Shyamalan&apos;s films since &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot; When &quot;The Village&quot; was released and subsequently panned, it seemed to fit the pattern that I myself had noticed. So I didn&apos;t go and see the film. Only recently did I take a look at it on cable, more out of curiosity than anything else.\n\nAnd alas, I found the first fifteen minutes rather slow. The movie has a lot of characters, and it doesn&apos;t quickly establish which ones are the most important. All we see is this primitive nineteenth-century village in the midst of woods that the villagers believe to be haunted by ominous, sentient creatures who will not harm the people as long as they don&apos;t set foot in the woods. The villagers have all sorts of rituals to protect themselves from attack, such as avoiding the color red (what is it with Shyamalan and red?) and wearing yellow hoods. But rules are meant to be broken, and a quiet, mysterious young man played by Joaquin Phoenix wants to journey into the woods so that he can visit &quot;the towns&quot; on the other side, which boast superior medicine. Among other things, he wonders if he&apos;ll find a cure for his mentally handicapped friend (Adrien Brody). In the meantime, he&apos;s falling in love with the blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) whose role in the plot will expand as the movie progresses.\n\nThe love story between Phoenix and Howard is well-handled and believable, transcending the romantic clichés. The two characters seem to possess a common understanding and don&apos;t have to talk much in order for us to feel the developing bond between them. But what they do say to each other is intriguing. My favorite line is &quot;Sometimes we don&apos;t do things we want to do so that others won&apos;t know we want to do them.&quot; Their personalities also transcend stereotype, particularly with Phoenix: while stoic and courageous, he&apos;s also shy and withdrawn, as revealed in scenes where he passes letters to the public council instead of speaking in front of them. His ultimate significance to the story turns the heroic convention on its head.\n\nEveryone in the village speaks in an oddly formal manner, using big words and avoiding contractions. The accents are American, but the diction is like that of a nineteenth-century English novel. Amazingly, the actors make this language sound natural as it rolls off their tongues. The cast includes several familiar faces: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, and the aforementioned Phoenix and Brody. But the star of the film is the as-yet unknown Howard, who delivers a performance so compelling that it&apos;s a shame the film was trashed by critics.\n\nMuch of the film concerns the relationships of the characters in the village, but the mystery of the creatures also dominates the plot. This is more of a quietly creepy &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-style tale than outright horror. Like Shyamalan&apos;s other films, it ultimately carries a message of hope and optimism. But Shyamalan does not forget his horror roots. No other Hollywood filmmaker today is better at crafting scenes where a character is being haunted by an evil presence. These scenes work because of Shyamalan&apos;s acute sense of how nightmares feel. Like all skilled horror directors, he knows not to focus on the monster itself but on the panicked reaction of the character being stalked.\n\nWhile the use of a blind character is hardly a new device, Shyamalan handles the scenes with Howard in an interesting way. Instead of the usual approach of teasing the audience by showing exactly what the blind character doesn&apos;t see, he practically makes us blind along with her. He has the camera follow her as she walks, so that we don&apos;t see what&apos;s in front of her. We soon realize that we are seeing little more than what she is able to discern about her surroundings. In crucial scenes, we are effectively almost as much in the dark as she is.\n\nI cannot say much more about the plot without ruining the movie&apos;s surprises, which are abundant. Critics dismissed &quot;The Village&quot; as a crude exercise in plot manipulation. I couldn&apos;t disagree more. While I&apos;m not certain that the logistics of the plot work in every detail, most of the criticisms I have heard reflect a superficial reading of the story.\n\nThe film has the same basic structure that Shyamalan always uses, where we are swept up in the events and only at the end do we find out what the movie was truly about. From there, we have to think backwards to understand the ultimate meaning of the story. I have seen the movie three times now, noticing new things each time. The social themes make me think that Shyamalan is familiar with Joseph Campbell&apos;s works on primitive societies and the origin of drama. The back story is very well thought out compared to that of the average thriller, and I feel some disappointment that more people aren&apos;t able to appreciate it. The beauty and genius of this film is a well-kept secret.",

      "name": "A deeply spiritual experience",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;How high can I fly&quot;, is the question Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi) asks during a helicopter flight simulation at the onset of Heaven, the latest film by Tom Tykwer, a question that does not become relevant until the end. Heaven raises the question of ends and means, specifically -- does a worthy end justify unacceptable means? It explores the answer in what is essentially an allegory about responsibility, transformation, and transcendence. Heaven was to be the first part of a trilogy by the late Polish director Kristov Kieslowski called Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell. Kieslowski, however, died in 1996 and was unable to complete it and the task of completion was given to Tykwer. Heaven merges the technical, fast-paced prowess of Tykwer with the slower-paced sublime poetics of Kieslowski and the result was, for me, a strange but deeply spiritual experience. \n\nIn Turin, Philippa Paccard (Cate Blanchett) an English teacher attempts to get even with an Italian drug dealer who caused one of her students to commit suicide. In trying to destroy what she perceives to be evil, she plants a bomb in his office wastebasket but the plan is thwarted and she inadvertently kills four innocent people in an elevator. Meanwhile, the drug dealer, Vendice is not harmed. Later when Philippa realizes the consequences of her actions and breaks down sobbing during an interrogation, she is comforted by carabinieri, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), who is in the room as her translator (she insists on testifying in English). Filippo is deeply attracted to the defendant and believes in her innocence. Together they formulate an escape that leads them to another act of revenge and finally into hiding in the Italian countryside where they become fugitives in the town of Montepulciano.\n\nThe film then shifts from a gritty reality-based drama to a dream-like poem about lovers on the run. Contrary to what one would expect, the lovers are totally calm and peaceful and resigned to their fate. The countryside where they are hiding is bathed in a glow that soaks everything in an ethereal light. Looking like innocent children out on a Halloween night, Philippa and Filippo identify with each other by shaving their heads and wearing identical clothes. The cinematography is wondrous. One of the most beautiful scenes is a faraway shot of the horizon and two shadowy figures coming together in silhouette next to a huge tree. I will never forget the radiance of Blanchett and the beatific look of love on the face of Ribisi.\n\n On the surface, Kieslowski seems to be telling us that we are at the mercy of a capricious universe. We try to do good and we end up doing wrong. We have excellent plans but do not foresee the consequences. Underneath this, however, is Kieslowski&apos;s vision that everything happens for a purpose, one that only God is aware of. There is little dialogue, only hushed silence and passionate glances. &quot;Heaven is about silence,&quot; Tykwer tells The New York Times. &quot;But all the silences have ten layers&quot;. \n\nThe film to me does not justify criminal acts. Rather, it says that while some of us may commit acts that are reprehensible no matter how worthy our motives, all of us can ultimately achieve transformation. As director Tom Tykwer put it, `The film (Heaven) is about redemption, basically the concept that love can help us find our true perspectives and our true meanings. This is not about God being somewhere else, but in ourselves and what a gift that is.&quot; In an ending that is transforming for both the characters and the viewer, the two lovers take responsibility for their actions and surrender, in Beckett&apos;s phrase, to &quot;the benign indifference of the universe&quot;. The meaning of the opening helicopter scene then becomes clear in an ascending epiphany of grace."

      "reviewBody": "The beautiful Transylvanian countryside, where a thin veil of modernity covers a continuing peasant lifestyle for many, is the setting for Peter Strickland&apos;s short, unsentimental film &apos;Katalin Varga&apos; about the aftermath of a rape. It&apos;s a quiet movie, strikingly shot, that offers no pretence of life easier than it actually is. To me, it seemed that the reaction of the perpetrator&apos;s wife seemed simultaneously slightly overdone (in terms of motivation) and underplayed; one might also suggest that the ending is not especially satisfying, probably because the film never lets us know exactly what it is that Katalin is hoping for. This can be justified, however, because it&apos;s completely plausible that the character doesn&apos;t know herself. In a nutshell, this is a revenge movie; but so much more interesting that most of what we see in this genre.",

And believe me - there is a lot to make fun of in this horror industry. As with any spoof there isn&apos;t really much of a plot to tell... High school kids face ghosts, demons and witches. Eyes pop out and ghosts bang their heads against walls. Possessed fly off whilst being exorcised. Headless zombies lose their heads. Witches get shoeshines. And so forth... O yeah... and Spiderman makes an appearance...\n\nI&apos;m not quite sure what to think of this movie, so I put myself to this test: Did I enjoy the movie? Yes. Did it make me laugh? From time to time. Did I enjoy it more than Scary Movie? Yes. Is it pointless? Yes. Is it so bad that its good? Hmm... not really.\n\nActing was from bad to decent with Andhika Gumilang doing the only proper acting job, even if his role was being a geeky idiot... But well... the guy has potential in comparison with some other members of the cast like ms Ugly Betty (watch the movie). \n\nSpecial effects are mostly OK and don&apos;t subtract from the movie. Ghosts are nicely done, sometimes better than in the original movie.\n\nIts actually the most surprising thing about the Indonesian horror movies. No matter how bad the plot and directing it seems that the &apos;monsters&apos; are actually nicely done, even though they are often overused and badly filmed to change them from scary into ridiculous.\n\nI&apos;ll give the movie a five and let you decide... I don&apos;t regret watching it, but don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever reminisce the movie...",

      "reviewBody": "Screenplay writer John Michael McDonagh&apos;s directorial debut, &quot;The Guard&quot; (2011) is really a fine movie, relying the least on the originality of its story, describing criminal proceedings of the group of cocaine drug-smugglers and their interaction with local police, set against the backdrop of small-town western Ireland, however, filled with crackling good dialogue, sparkling with wisecracks, accompanied with nice scenery and pleasant, unobtrusive music. But, what makes it the best is its protagonists&apos; performances.\n\nBrendan Gleeson is usually natural, making the character he plays fit like a glove—whether the robust and humorous loyal buddy and the warrior, as in &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), or a quiet and subdued aspiring politician, as in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), or a non-supportive father, civil war volunteer-turned-deserter, as in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003), whether the gentle, mentoring, culture-exploring hit man in hiding, as in &quot;In Bruges&quot; (2008), or on the other side of the law, the grouchy police sergeant with defiant, often dissident sense of humour (provocative in one-liners like &quot;being FBI, don&apos;t you prefer to fight unarmed women and children&quot;), as in this movie--and Don Cheadle, in the role of FBI agent Wendell Everett, a bit in the shade of Gleeson&apos;s Gerry Boyle, but nevertheless, sufficiently competitive (&quot;Langley is CIA, I&apos;m FBI&quot;), neat and convincing in his performance as always. (I admit to have a soft spot for this actor since his impressive role of the manager of Kigali Mille Collines hotel in the movie &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; (2004), the very same hotel I have been frequenting for two months in 1995, just a year later to tragic events described in the movie.)\n\nTo a pretty frequent movie goer like myself, who hasn&apos;t seen a single en par (or better?) leading actor in this year that is rapidly advancing towards its end, it is hard to believe that very many better acting performances could be demonstrated in the remaining two months or so. Therefore, if Brendan Gleeson does not find himself at least among top nominees for any yearly awarded film prize, I&apos;ll have a problem finding such decisions just.\n\nAs a marginal note, I was lucky to watch this movie back home in my motherland, because having it subtitled was very helpful in order not to miss any of sergeant Boyle&apos;s wisecracks, delivered often in heavy Irish accent, and to understand at all occasional lines, uttered by marginal characters, spoken completely in Gaelic. Of course, point was not to be understood by English native speakers, but it was still interesting to know what usual &quot;advices&quot; (if not insults) were given to English speakers, though eventually not English (as FBI agent!) at all. As Irish colleague of mine once said &quot;We don&apos;t sing songs in Gaelic so English people cannot understand how badly we talk about them, they know it already! We sing in Gaelic simply because that&apos;s our traditional language (N.B. official whatsoever), and songs sound much better and sweeter in it.&quot;",

His &quot;conversion&quot; sparks a multitude of organizations to try to stop him from doing further damage. There is much to look at, and the pace is fast.

It looks more real than any other American teenager movie played by young beautiful adults passing for sixteen year old adolescents. In Les Beaux Gosses you get the typical view of adolescents discovering the other gender. Most of the time frustrated by their excessive testosterone, they try to have their first sexual experience, or try to get it on with their secret crush. Normally it&apos;s not the kind of movies I would go for but I have to admit it was funny to watch. Not all the time but it has it&apos;s moments.",

The plot revolves around a phony swami and his unlikely gang of wrestler/thugs who concoct a phony seance to defraud a beautiful young woman out of her inheritance. \n\nSanto and his two wrestler-buddies (referred to in the film simply as &quot;Gray Mask&quot; and &quot;Black Mask&quot;) take on the swami &amp; his thugs in no less than six individual fight sequences during the course of the film. In one scene, the thugs all decide to jump into the ring during one of Santo&apos;s wrestling bouts and beat the daylights out of him in front of thousands of amazed spectators! \n\nThe fistfights seem to go on interminably, and by the end of the film, every character has taken an incredible amount of physical abuse. Santo is pummeled, kicked and bumrushed so many times, I lost count. During the course of one melee, a cowardly little pistolero even puts a bullet into him! \n\nIn the finale, the phony mystic dresses up one of his thugs (the always entertaining Mexi-wrestler Benny Galan) in a Santo costume, and Santo comes busting into the seance and takes on his surprised clone mano-a-mano, while Santo&apos;s buddies kick butt on the rest of the goons. \n\nThis film is just loaded with well-choreographed action (reminiscent of the old Republic serials of the 1940&apos;s) and just never lets up.",

Along way, races, redemption, and wackiness (unintentional) happen. The story and acting are a little flat, as is the action. However, the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored.\n\nOverall, just a simple sub par 50&apos;s flick, but far from the worst movie ever made, with some bright spots in the movie (The Ave Maria sequence was good for me).\n\nIf you get a chance to watch the MST3K version, you won&apos;t be disappointed. By it self, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture (&quot;Spiker&quot; anyone?).",

      "reviewBody": "Har pal yaha, jeebhar jiyo, jo hai samaa...kal ho naa ho...\n\nIt takes a special person to apreciate a great Bollywood movie.  There&apos;s the constant melodrama, the endless love triangles and dress changes, the randomly inserted songs and hammy dialogue...not to mention the age-old desire to be everything to every viewer. There are so many Hollywood-esque problems that threaten its quality, so many qualms that any self-respecting American critic would feel compelled to point out, that loving it seems like a chore.  If anybody can do so, however, it is an Indian.\n\nAnd I LOVE being an Indian.\n\nKAL HO NAA HO (&quot;Tomorrow May or May Not Come&quot;) is the third film involving writer-director Karan Johar and Dharma Productions, an Indian film label that has become synonymous with box-office and critical gold.  Their first two productions, KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI and KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM were both , in their respective times, the most popular Hindi films of all time, and with good reason.  They were the ultimate crowd pleasers: a perfect mix of comedy and drama with compelling stories, masterful performances, catchy music, and impeccable direction.  They hit every emotional high and low possible in the typical Bollywood audience, and the end results were magnificent.  KAL HO NAA HO continues this tradition in grand style.\n\nNaina Catherine (Priety Zinta) is the eldest daughter of Jenny Kapoor (Jaya Bachchan) and a father whose suicide has wreaked havoc on the entire Kapoor family.  The constant bickering among the members of her household has transformed Naina into a pitiful bore who has &quot;forgotten&quot; how to smile. Her best friend is Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), a fellow MBA student who has seen Naina through all her troubles.  The two have never been more than just friends.\n\nAlong comes Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan), a charasmatic man who enters the Kapoors&apos; home and changes their lives for the better, much to Naina&apos;s dismay.  Aman helps every member of the family with any problem and seems to have all the answers - he is perfect.  Aman eventually wins over Naina and changes her into a smiling young woman once again, but not before she begins to have feelings for him.  What&apos;s more, Rohit soon reveals that he loves Naina.\n\nYet all is not as it seems.  There are secrets to be uncovered, pasts to be mended, and futures to be made, and what the trio find out may suprise them.\n\nThis is, firstly, an immesnly pleasing film.  The first half jumps right into the act with some wonderfully comedic scenes showcasing the talent of all three leads and the flair of first-time director Nikhil Advani.  A particular scene involving a housemaid who suspects Aman and Rohit of being gay is among the most humorous Hindi film moments I&apos;ve seen.  Karan Johar&apos;s forté with dialogue really shines here -everything is quick-witted and funny, yet never insulting to the intelligence (many Hindi films can be). We grow to love and care about these characters quickly, but thankfully characterization does not bog down the forward motion of the marrative. The first 90 minutes literally flies by.\n\nThe most noticable aspect of KHNH is the tone the writer and director bring to the film: it&apos;s incredibly energetic and light, and takes chances with material that worked for me.  Many times, the characters seem to speak one-on-one with the camera in an interview style to convey personal feelings or thoughts, an interesting tactic.  There are other little touches: the &quot;Day 1&quot;, &quot;Day 2&quot;, etc. introductions stand out in particular (see the film to find out what I mean).  There is an incredible scope and vibrant feel to the movie, as in an Dharma production.\n\nThe second half of the film gives all involved a chance to really shine. Once the twist is revealed, things take a downward turn and the climax begins. Much of the light tone from the first 90 minutes creeps its way into the second half at all the right moments, but there are some truly heart-wrenching scenes toward the end of the film. This is to be expected, but their impact is heightened by the skill of the filmmakers.  In most cases, Hindi films pile crying scenes on top of one another in the hope of eliciting some, if any, reponses from the audience, but KHNH succeeds due to solid characterization and wonderful performances.\n\nThis is clearly Shah Rukh Khan&apos;s film, and he acts his heart out.  It&apos;s the same performance we&apos;ve seen a million times from him, but his skills aren&apos;t broke so they don&apos;t need any tuning.  His screen prescence is unmatched in this industry, and he captivates you during both the comedic and emotional scenes.  This was a chance for him to paly a different type of character, and his natural charisma lends itself well to what the part requires. Priety Zinta finally steps into the limelight as Naina with a wonderful performance that reveals her true potential.  Watching her onscreen transformation is as unexpected as it is alluring.  Saif Ali Khan essentially echoes his character from DIL CHAHTA HAI, but the magic has not worn off.  He has a knack for playing the straight man with unfulfilled, and still unkonwn, desires.  Supporting performances are from the usual Johar suspects and are accordingly wonderful.\n\nShankar-Ehsaan-Loy finally enter the Johar ring with this entry and certainly hold their own.  The title song is my choice for song of the year - a gently sung ballad about living life to the fullest, complimented by wonderful lyrics from Javed Akhtar and great singing by Sonu Nigam.  The other romantic song, &quot;Kuch To Hua Hai&quot; is a very contemporary song with an international flavor that manages to please with an unusual beat and interesting composition.  &quot;It&apos;s The Time To Disco&quot; is the loser of this disc, although its film picturization is likable enough, and the much hyped &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (yes, based on the classic American song) is surprisingly upbeat and entertaining.  The obligatory BSMDGC (Big Set, Many Dancers, Good Choreography) dance number is &quot;Maahi Ve&quot;, a very catchy tune that bears some resemblance to the hit &quot;Shava Shava&quot; from KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM.  Farah Khan&apos;s onscreen choreography for the song does not disappoint, and the art direction is simply marvelous.\n\nThis film marks a new standard for Hindi film editing, and shows just how much Bollywood has learned from its L.A. counterpart.  We have quick cuts, new wipes, and even splitscreens...all used wisely and not for cheap effect. The editing really brings the first half of the film to life, giving every song a &quot;get up and dance&quot; feeling that never hurts.\n\nAbove all, this is Nikhil Advani&apos;s film.  Remarkably, this novice helmer shows no signs of being a rookie.  In true Johar style, he handles all the film&apos;s emotional scenes, a perennial marker for directorial excellence, with confidence and talent.  Having served before as assistant director to Karan Johar and Aditya Chopra, Advani pulls out all the stops here, giving us epic, dramatic camera direction, eliciting great performances, and near-perfect pacing.\n\nSure, a good 10 minutes shaved off the finished product would be in the film&apos;s favor, but it is a minor qubble in a sea of compliments.\n\nThis is ultimately a story about hope and love - the hope to keep moving and beliving, the love to keep surviving.  It is a story about the choices we make for love and the effects those choices have on our loved ones.  It is about living life to the fullest and seizing the day, for Kal Ho Naa Ho?"

I enjoyed it so much because it depicts a young man learning to deal with his emotions, rather than being ruled by his fear of them. It is quite remarkable, the strength of character he ultimately develops, and his interactions with his instructor are gratifyingly free of the childish morality one dreads in such a film, or the typical oriental platitudes that often hallmark them because of the origins of martial arts. At the root of this, I think, is the film&apos;s willingness to observe and comment on the &apos;problem&apos; emotion of anger. Rather than leave it festering, or simply transform it &apos;as if by magic&apos;, the audience can almost see the transformation in the main character, through his physical exertion, which eventually leaves him free of its destructive role in his life. For most, if not all, these reasons, I enjoyed the film because it resonated with me quite closely, but it may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea.\n\nIf nothing else, I for one will be researching the possibilities of training in mixed martial arts!",

Yes, It&apos;s a genre that&apos;s been done a lot, but that doesn&apos;t make this film inherently bad.\n\nIt had some enjoyable moments in it.\n\nI have immense amounts of respect for the crew who worked on this movie, due to how much the internet kicked up a storm and how they worked tirelessly to try re-jig the movie to make it work. That doesn&apos;t mean the movie is perfect, but the respect for the craft is there.\n\nLong story short; It&apos;s not a perfect movie, but you can tell that effort was made in it&apos;s creation.

With high hopes and ideals, he aspires not only to do more but to become more...and for a while he succeeds. But the world is different, people are different, and the old heroes he admired are not just obsolete--they are extinct.\n\nWe are inexorably drawn through his disillusionment and our own to an ending that is sad, tragic, and inevitable.",

Now,&quot;Scary Movie&quot; parodies slasher teen movies,mainly,&quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;i know what you did last summer&quot;,but,take jabs at other films even &quot;matrix&quot;.So the film synopsis is the same than from &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;IKWYDLS&quot;,only adding stupid,because it is a stupid version of these films.Sinopsis:stupid teens accidentally kill a man,one year later,these teens are chased by a stupid killer.See?Now,despite being one of the funniest movies i ever seen,it still has it bad moments,i mean,even naked gun has bad moments.One of the problems is after a while,the movie loses it steam,and the jokes get bad (those are probably the Seltzer- Friedberg parts of the script) but still it&apos;s a very funny movie and i recommend to everyone who likes stupidity and spoofs,even those who don&apos;t like may enjoy it",

      "reviewBody": "After indicating that she would rather not continue, a writer takes over the rest of his daughter&apos;s swimming instructions because he&apos;s interested in her swimming instructor. So after some lessons from Giulia (the name of the swimming instructor), he eventually works his way up to &quot;friendly conversation level&quot; with her and a little later on to &quot;ask her out level&quot;. But she refuses. Giulia doesn&apos;t date at night. And with good reason, we shortly learn, after she explains to the writer that she&apos;s in jail and only out on a work permit. Gotta give that writer credit. He didn&apos;t even blink. Personally, my eyes would have popped out of my head. Well anyway, the guy is not put off; he continues to pursue her.\n\nAt the start of the movie the writer is one of the finalist for a writer&apos;s award. At the suggestion of his publisher, he attempts to get a new book started and so the real story line of him and Giulia alternates with the stories and characters of his imagination. One is about a man who never has an umbrella when it rains and who is in love with a woman who has an umbrella store. The other is about a priest concerned about a female parishioner who works as a lap dancer. These ideas for a new book eventually begin to get less attention as the writer&apos;s relationship with Giulia develops and he begins to write about her. And we see this visually represented as the imaginary characters group concernedly around the writer as he sleeps at his desk before his computer.\n\nThe writer appears to have a fair relationship with his daughter though she seems somewhat troubled. Not so with his wife. He&apos;s polite, friendly and complimentary to her, but if she tries to get too close he pushes her away. The impression one get&apos;s is that he&apos;s not in love with her. For some reason Giulia &quot;inspires&quot; him and his wife does not. He continues to see her whenever he can. Giulia has a daughter she has only seen from a distance during her incarceration. The writer takes it upon himself to intervene and write a letter on her behalf.\n\nThe relationship between the writer and Giulia is neither a sexy or torrid love affair; not particularly passionate. Rather it&apos;s a slow-moving relationship movie about an unhappy enigmatic woman prisoner and the writer besotted with her. Finally, not really my cup of tea. I felt it needed more intensity and some more humor. So basically, a mildly interesting movie about an affair under odd circumstances and people that generally do not seem particularly happy. Love, Boloxxxi.",

However, my inability to fully comprehend what &quot;Sonatine&quot; is about doesn&apos;t strike me as a flaw.  Rather, the film is much more complicated than the usual gangster film.\n\nIt begins with very unsentimentalized and nonglorified violence. People hit and kill each other and it isn&apos;t much different than toast popping out of the toaster. It is fast, moderately bloody, and there. Kitano doesn&apos;t seem to be interested in thrilling us with either the danger, grotesqueness, or thrill of violence--another, not clearly defined agenda is at work here.\n\nAt perhaps a third of the way into the film, it makes a sudden transition from this gangster life to a period of forced inactivity. I suspect this section, which is delightfully playful, is at the heart of this film.",

Finally seeing it several months ago, I could understand why. But I decided to see this second &quot;sequel&quot; (it has nothing to do with the events of the first movie... and probably the second movie as well) since I had the opportunity to see it for free.\n\nWell, this Canadian movie is one of the few that has something distinctly Canadian in it (the plane is flying to the city Toronto). And the production values aren&apos;t as cheap as with many Canadian films, though some of the interiors of the plane look kind of cheesy. (Plus, the stock footage used is VERY obvious, since it came from a much more expensive film.) Also, I found that the choice for the hero chosen to fight the villains on the plane kind of a surprise. Usually this particular kind of character in hostage situations like this remains helpless until the very end.\n\nThat&apos;s about all that&apos;s positive I can say about this movie. While I didn&apos;t find the movie terrible, I did find it pretty dull. There are pretty much no surprises in this movie. If you&apos;ve seen one hostage movie, you have seen this one. Plus, the movie took a surprisingly long time to unfold - 3/4 of the movie goes by before the good guys finally start fighting back.\n\nNote to Rutger Hauer fans - it&apos;s pretty obvious that all of his scenes were filmed in one day."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Two Lives of Mattia Pascal&quot; is a thought-provoking cinematic exploration directed by Mario Monicelli, delving into the complexities of identity, fate, and the unexpected turns life can take. While not without its flaws, the film manages to captivate audiences through its eerie atmosphere and standout performances. The narrative revolves around Mattia Pascal, portrayed with depth by the talented lead, as he navigates the turbulent waters of deception and self-discovery. A petty profiteer, Mattia finds himself entangled in a web of deceit orchestrated by the cunning administrator Malagna, played with charismatic flair by Néstor Garay. The film takes an intriguing turn as Mattia&apos;s life undergoes a sudden transformation after leaving his family. The pacing accelerates, introducing a host of compelling characters and challenging Mattia&apos;s perception of himself. The arrival of Véronique (Caroline Berg) adds a layer of complexity, intertwining romance with the broader themes of the narrative. One notable aspect is the film&apos;s atmospheric score by Nicola Piovani, which effectively enhances the viewing experience. The music, alert and powerful, lends a touch of mystery, occasionally evoking the suspenseful ambiance reminiscent of a &apos;giallo&apos; film. Monicelli&apos;s directorial choices, marked by detachment, sarcasm, and coolness, contribute to the film&apos;s unique style. The lack of a smooth transition between Mattia&apos;s provincial life and his Monte-Carlo escapade adds an element of surprise, aligning with Monicelli&apos;s signature directorial approach. The cast, particularly Laura Del Sol as Mattia&apos;s wife Romilda and Clelia Rondinella as the rustic beauty Oliva, adds depth and dimension to the narrative. Their performances, along with the supporting cast, contribute to the film&apos;s overall charm. While &quot;The Two Lives of Mattia Pascal&quot; may not rank among Monicelli&apos;s masterpieces, it remains a suspenseful and amusing piece of cinema. The film&apos;s straightforward narrative, combined with moments of grimness, mockery, and cynicism, captures the audience&apos;s attention, albeit in a somewhat standard TV manner.",

Well, I&apos;m here to tell ya I really liked it.\n\nMy former teacher reccomended it to my mother....she said she thought I would like it.... so my Mom brought it home, ostensibly for my little sister, and I watched it that night while everyone else was gone, because I really like John Candy and I recently fell in love with Richard Lewis (in &quot;Once Upon a Crime&quot; believe me it doesn&apos;t happen often) Anyway, I wasn&apos;t particularly expecting a funny movie, but I liked the premise, and then it started and I about died laughing. Candy is distinctly uncomfortable during it, something understandable, and the movie definitely pulls no punches. But even so, all the actors had such great comic presence.... I&apos;m not usually a laugh out loud person, and so the only parts I laughed at was the revelation of Harlow&apos;s secret (I&apos;;m no snitch, I won&apos;t tell you what it is) and ensuing conversation, and the Big Tough General Larchmont asking for a bedtime story, and Lewis&apos;s conversation with his kids....amounting to the sort of things that would go on in a regular, modern-day car ride when you have a son and a daughter. But the biggest surprise: Lewis himself. Here we have a guy with a big chin and buggy eyes, who always appears as himself, constantly has shoulder-length greasy hair, and one of the oddest smiles since the days of Chico Marx.... and here we have me, laughing at him. Go figure. I love Chico Marx too."

The director admitted that He asked the Kids to do the theater, but presents it as if it was reality, making the public believe that this is how kids play in the streets of Brazil. This is unetical, not a documentary, shouldn&apos;t be a reference.\n\nI believe that it&apos;s time for the young Americans to start looking into solving their own problems at home. And not only look for sensationalism , violence and misery but, beauty and successful experiences in other cultures, not only they problems, feeding prejudices and fear. \n\nIt&apos;s time to exchange ideas , using art as communication, a Global believe of trust and enlightenment.

      "reviewBody": "Sanjay&apos;s Super Team is a breath of fresh air, not only to Pixar animation, but to all of mainstream animation and certainly to anything generally coming from Disney. This short follows Sanjay, a little boy who is a big fan of superheroes, but not of practicing his religion much to the dismay of his traditional Hindu father. But as the tables turn, Sanjay is thrust into action and the short really takes off into beautifully wild and inspiring action. Through a series of different styles of animation, Sanjay&apos;s adventure goes from mundane to epic, bringing with it bright colors and intricate designs that command the screen.\n\nThis short is shiny, a true visual feast, but it also stands out for its story content. Sanjay&apos;s Super Team feels authentic because it is, as real life Sanjay Patel directed the short based on exaggerated experiences from his youth. It&apos;s lovely to see a culture and it&apos;s religion that is oft overlooked in American cinema get some attention. This is Pixar&apos;s first project, of all of their shorts and feature-length projects alike, featuring humans to be lead by a person of color protagonist, after all, so it&apos;s as important as it is fun, if not more. It&apos;s also nice to see Hinduism and it&apos;s Gods portrayed in such an encouraging and positively energetic way.\n\nIt has moments reminiscent of The Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack, which is a completely good thing. If only Pixar had given us a new feature length action film of this caliber and laid those tired old dinosaur bones to rest.",

      "reviewBody": "The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it...or me. It is not a good movie.  Terrible in fact.  But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away.  It would have made a great MST3K subject!\n\nMost of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience.  You&apos;ll thrill to slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but WHO&apos;S SHOT?  Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally goes down.  You&apos;ll sing along (in latin of course) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death&apos;s-choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.\n\nSo if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you.  It&apos;s not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, &quot;They Live&quot; featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it&apos;s more fun to watch than luke-warm movies like Omen II or III.\n\nI give it 4 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "A very cute, well directed and acted Hungarian action/crime/comedy from the &apos;80s of communist Hungary. A story about a stolen museum relic (the madonna), a clumsy cop (András Kern) and a Balaton sailor (István Bujtor), who&apos;s a cop, too, but kind of retired and not really aspiring for success as the other one and of course about the lifestyle of people living around the beautiful lake Balaton in those time. Being a Hngarian born in Romania I saw this movie first time in a Romanian Cinema, which was a big deal, it meant a lot for us, for Hungarians living in Romania, as it was shown in the darkest Romanian communist era, when no movies were shown on TV at all, we couldn&apos;t hear Hungarian speech on TV or Radio (there was no cable TV or satellite receiver in that time). I remember all the tickets were sold out and we could buy them only on the black market (from gypsies, who bought them for 6 lei (Romanian currency) and sold them for 25 leis each). I loved this movie. And then I saw the movie something like 15 years later on TV in Hungary and I still enjoyed it. You know, it&apos;s not comparable to a Hollywood action movie, it certainly has its weaknesses, but it&apos;s ours, and we love it. I strongly recommend for Hungarians living abroad.",

Maybe and probably it&apos;s because of the empty script that focuses too much on Gonzo and not enough on the fun feeling of the movie that all other Muppet movies do have.\n\nStill the movie is highly enjoyable and it has some great comical moments that will at least put a smile on you face. And how could you not laugh at a Muppet movie with so many great, fun and weird characters. The ones that really steal the show in this movie are Pepe and Rentro but of course all the other Muppet characters are also more than funny and great.\n\nWorth watching simply and only because of the Muppet characters and if you want to have some fun 84 minutes, otherwise you will end up only disappointed by this lacking movie.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing the first Tomie movie i lost all interest in seeing what the sequels in the serial would bring. For a horror movie, there wasn&apos;t a single chill or climax in it, which can only leave a horror fan like me very disappointed. But then i saw that Tomie: Re-birth was directed by no other than Takashi Shimizu (The man behind the four Ju-on movies), and i thought, and (i guess) expected, that he would add a lot of his creepy imagination from his former horror movies (i cant praise them enough) to this sleeping pill of a weird love story. I was, again, VERY disappointed. Though, i have 2 good things to say about this movie. First of all, this one IS better than the first. Second, there actually was one scene in Re-birth that made my hair on the neck to stand up, and that is where a girl is sitting in her bedroom in front of a mirror and suddenly sees a girl, white as snow, peeking out of her closet. Uuhhhhhh Mufasa!! It smelled a little like Ju-on, but then the girl turns away from the mirror and the ghostly lurker is gone. BUUUUUUH!! But besides this minor chill that lasts about 3 seconds, its really hard to see that this is a Shimizu creation. Instead of taking Tomie to a new level and making it to a real creep fest, it seems more like he just goes along with the dull and not THAT fascinating theme from the other Tomie movies. And on top of that, i saw interviews with the cast and the director himself describing this movie as a blend of horror and humor? Now, without sounding like a dumb racist, but do you have to be Japanese to notice the humor? It went over my head thats for sure. But maybe some of the moments that i found laughable and not creepy, like the crawling head, wasn&apos;t meant to be scary but fun? I guess i never find out and its not important anyway. I mean, Tomie IS a horror movie right? At least, thats what it says on the movie description. But how on earth is it possible to make a horror movie where the so called &quot;monster&quot; dies all the time, killed by all its &quot;victims&quot;, and not the other way around? So far Tomie hasn&apos;t convinced me that it can be done... \n\nPlease Shimizu, stick to the creepy stuff. Thats what you do best.\n\nI gave it 5 out of 10",

Too bad the movie wasn&apos;t as good as the people in it.\n\nDennis Hopper (Hoosiers, Easy Rider), who also produced and directed the movie, played Milo, a hit man hired by the mob to catch the girl. Unfortunately, they didn&apos;t figure him to become obsessed with her, and what&apos;s more we didn&apos;t figure that she would develop Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nThis film came in between Foster&apos;s two Oscar winning performances in The Accused and Silence of the Lambs. We get a good look at Jodie&apos;s Fosters not once, but twice in the most skintastic performance of her career. She is one good looking woman.",

Repulsive sex story between Winston and a female cop. Carter was played by a plank. The Sweeney in the Met could not exist as portrayed in this day and age - 70s is where is belongs and trying to update it was a total failure in all departments.

The lady&apos;s suicide was also tough to watch.\n\nThe faked footage (executions, croc attack) almost subverted the intention of the film. Dealing with death. If they wanted to show executions, show something that can be verified.\n\nThe bear attack was probably influenced by the fake lion attack in &apos;Great Hunting.&apos; And the middle eastern restaurant (with a white staff) serving the fresh monkey for killing was ripped off of &apos;Man From Deep River.&apos; The scene with the grieving father trying to raise his dead son &amp; wife through a medium may have been hard to watch for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMost people see this...just to say they&apos;ve seen it.",

      "reviewBody": "White Zombie (1932) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nYoung couple Neil (John Harron) and Madeleine (Madge Bellamy) meet a man on a cruise who offers them his mansion to get married in. As soon as they arrive they realize things really aren&apos;t normal due to some zombie like people walking around. They eventually meet the man turning these people into zombies, Legendre (Bela Lugosi) who plans on turning the woman.\n\nWHITE ZOMBIE is a film that horror fans usually end up in a heated debate about. Some people love every second of the film while others have a hard time reaching the end credits because they fall asleep. To me this film could easily be called an incredibly flawed masterpiece and I think it proves that you don&apos;t have to be a great director to create something special. I say this because director Victor Halperin has created some incredibly great moments here but when you take a look at his other films like SUPERNATURAL, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES and TORTURE SHIP, there&apos;s none of the &quot;talent&quot; on display that you see here. In fact, I think it would be very fair to say that WHITE ZOMBIE is good simply by luck.\n\nWhat I love about the film is its creepy and rather surreal atmosphere. Right from the opening shot you can just feel the darkness of the area and there&apos;s no question that you really do feel as if you&apos;re in this location and it&apos;s a place you&apos;d want to get out of as quick as possible. There are some terrific moments scattered throughout this film but I think one could argue that the opening sequence right up to when we first see Lugosi, is among the best moments in any horror film from this period. There are other great moments including the drum beat that is used throughout the picture and there are some beautiful matte shots of the castle, which are quite haunting.\n\nAnother great thing going for the film is the performance of Lugosi. Who knows where the truth and the myth goes but after not getting the monster role in FRANKENSTEIN you have to wonder why Lugosi wanted to do such a low-budget film. Again, there are countless theories out there but this role certainly isn&apos;t the &quot;sexy&quot; role that Dracula was. Lugosi is quite evil here and he manages to do it without every going over-the-top but instead he stays pretty calm and collective throughout. He&apos;s given a terrific look and there&apos;s no question that the actor knows how to use his eyes to display coldness. The supporting players really aren&apos;t all that memorable but each of them are good enough for what they&apos;re asked to do.\n\nThere are many flaws to be found in WHITE ZOMBIE. The film moves at a snail&apos;s pace and while this might help the atmosphere, after a while the movie really begins to drag. In fact, I&apos;ve seen this movie countless times and I always feel like I&apos;ve accomplished something great when I can make it through in one sitting without falling asleep. Another flaw can be. It&apos;s hard to bash the direction for some at times silly looking stuff when you&apos;re at the same time praising him for the atmosphere he brings to the picture. WHITE ZOMBIE really is a hard film to judge but it remains an important part of horror history and there are enough strengths to make it worth viewing."

The narrating style is very open and the storyline or kind of lack of storyline makes it a very different film from what at least i am used to. I must admit that i am not sure what the director is trying to say with the film but.. do you really have to understand that when a film reach you in another level. The &quot;main&quot; characters in the movie are people you usually find uncomfortable to be around or even annoying. At the same time I found these feelings mixed with sympathy and sometimes pity. Watching gitarrmongot kind of &quot;makes you&quot; take a look at the people you usually pass by while looking in another direction. I do recommend it to anyone who think they can watch it with an open mind. If you just want to be entertained for an hour and a half and not reflect over the movie you probably are better off with something else. gitarrmongot is a movie that i will remember and that actually might have changed my views on the world if only for a tiny little bit or at least it made me think about this subject for a while.... for that I&apos;m giving it a 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Japanese ghost story movies tend to be long on atmosphere, chills and short,sharp shocks, and short on coherent plot development and characterization. Pray is no exception. Actually, when you think about it, those are really the defining qualities of ghost stories everywhere. The point of the ghost story is to scare, not involve you in an uplifting literary experience. Pray does its job well, just don&apos;t expect it to be more than it needs to be. A group of young hoodlums does a kidnapping caper but things begin to fall apart when the victim turns out to be something spooky. The film keeps several plot developments hanging around unexplained until the end, and this helps keeps the suspense level up. There is a lot of running around in dark hallways and in and out of empty rooms with the wind whistling eerily in the background. There is not much gore unless the sight of a severed hand is particularly disturbing for you. The denouement is a little flat when the nature of the creepy little girl is explained but it&apos;s very Japanese.",

      "reviewBody": "After reading nothing more than bad reps, I can see why. I find director John Frankenheimer to be a very capable action director, but here he&apos;s lost in a sea of murky conspiracies (involving a fourth Reich) and idle performances (Victoria Tennant and Anthony Andrews are unconvincing) in this very lukewarm, but drearily complicated political thriller. The problem mainly was contributed to the confounded screenplay (a Robert Ludlum adaptation), which lacked probability; efficient enough thrills and consisted of one-note characters. For most part it&apos;s about globe trotting (some striking international scenery), Michael Caine looking like a fish out of water, meeting up with important figures, those involved reminding each other how much danger they are in and shady scheming being set in motion for this 4.5 billion dollar Nazi fund. Too bad it&apos;s not as exciting and gripping, as it might sound. It lumbers along in quite an repetitive manner, even though a committed Frankenheimer tries his best to inject some stylishly, go-for-broke action suspense; when he does (and this few and far between) it shows his great eye for details and precision with the camera (he loved the tilting camera). Nonetheless he can only work what he has and what the source material allows (one or two stirring moments occur). No one really stands out from the cast; but Bernard Hepton has some amusing dialogue exchanges with Caine and Lilly Palmer has a small role. A frustratingly, unsatisfying mystery thriller.",

      "reviewBody": "Comedy. The picture of famous Soviet directors Alexander Zarkhi (shot the best film adaptation of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; in 1967) and Joseph Heifitz (&quot;My Dear Man&quot; in 1958, &quot;Big Family&quot; in 1954), and in the thirties they were just starting their creative journey together, and even then they were noted for their works, one of which we will consider it today. And I looked at this picture on the recommendation of an experienced film critic who is well versed in Soviet cinema. I looked - and was not disappointed. And here&apos;s my brief opinion for you - The bright love of a tanker and a student. I will note right away that I did not notice the minuses in the picture, but there are some comments that I will describe in a separate paragraph, but for now I will focus your attention on the pros of this comedy.\n\nSo, here they are: 1. Scenario - a tank brigade of the Red Army arrives in a small provincial Soviet town, which excites all residents. One of the commanders, Mikhail Belokon, is settled in the house where a young student of the agricultural college Tonya Zhukova lives. Since both heroes are young, the feeling flares up instantly, but not everything is so simple, because these are the thirties - the time of the formation of the greatest generation in the history of mankind - the generation of builders of communism, who will face many trials. The party, family, friends - everything leaves its mark on the feelings of the heroes. Add here Tony&apos;s friends, Belokon&apos;s wayward colleagues, while all these characters are bright and interesting, and memorable, simple everyday dialogues, all this is seasoned with humor, a predictable ending - and you get a fairly strong everyday history of those years, which was not too different from reality. If you are tired of monotonous romcoms or melodramas, then this comedy will surprise you pretty much (especially if you haven&apos;t watched a movie of the thirties before). The story turned out to be beautiful and memorable.\n\n2. The Thirties - I haven&apos;t seen a lot of paintings of that time, but this one quite accurately conveys the life and moods of those years. People&apos;s hopes and dreams. This is especially clearly shown by the example of Tony. The uniforms of the soldiers and commanders of the Red Army were transmitted with documentary accuracy (after all, there was a military consultant). The tanks shown are real (mostly BT-2, which were then in service). All sorts of household trifles, portraits of Lenin (but there is no Stalin for some reason?). All this will be interesting even from a historical point of view. And in terms of atmosphere, all this does its job. There is not even pathos in the picture, which is inherent in all Soviet cinema of that time, and this is even surprising.\n\n3. Humor - do not hope for wild laughter and laughter, because here the viewer will be amused by funny situations and ridiculous moments in which the characters of the picture will fall. Well, not bad, although there are a couple of memorable moments (a bet, a date). Personally, I often had a slight smile creeping up, but I managed to laugh openly only twice. It&apos;s a pity, I would like more, because it&apos;s a comedy.\n\n4. Acting - here I can only praise, because everyone tried, from the main characters to the extras, who appear in the frame for just a few minutes. Of the secondary heroes, I can mention Yanina Zhaimo (&quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1947) and the genius of reincarnation, who always occupies the first line - Nikolai Konstantinovich Cherkasov (&quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; in 1938), whom I barely recognized again, and then thanks to his loud voice and tall stature, who plays a lagging student here.\n\nA little bit about the main characters: 1. Mikhail Belokon, performed by Nikolai Simonov, is a tank commander who always fails. A determined person, a workaholic who does not have enough time for everything else, which is why he almost overlooked his happiness. Nikolai Konstantinovich coped superbly with this role, and it was this success that influenced his participation in the grand epic &quot;Peter the Great&quot; in 1938. Bravo!\n\n2. Tonya Zhukova, performed by Tatiana Okunevskaya, is a young college student who dreams of becoming an agronomist and thereby benefiting the Soviet Homeland, but the arrival and settlement of Belokon violate this idyll, because the girl falls in love with the hero without looking back, and he does not seem to notice it. A beauty that you will fall in love with - and you will never forget it, while she is modest, but sometimes bold. I kiss a pen to you Tatiana Kirillovna!\n\nNow about some remarks. In a couple of places, there are mounting glues (I do the installation myself, so this case is familiar to me), and even an ordinary viewer can notice it. What was there? Maybe a bad shot? Or a phrase about Stalin? History is silent. The humor turned out to be not as funny as I had hoped, because even in the &quot;Restless Household&quot; there were much more funny moments, I&apos;m not talking about funny situations, and here all this is not enough.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to note that for the thirties, innovative techniques were used here, which have long been an invariable attribute, for example, combined filming, the most modern cameras with excellent optics at that time. This picture was even purchased for rental in the USA. So they were proud!\n\nAs a result, we have a good comedy about the life of Soviet people of the thirties, with a good script, a light atmosphere, and great acting.\n\nMy rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Rats , Night of Terror&quot; is set in 2225 , the nuclear war has devastated the Earth, but the planet has been reborn into two factions, the scavengers living above in the wasteland and the underground society. There some beleaguered survivors of a nuclear holocaust come across a town infested with carnivorous rats, as they struggle with a mutant rodent problem. Searching for water an food they become involved with dangerous and starving beings . In order to survive the long night they use all kinds of objects to kill them, such as flame throwers, sharp tools , assault arms and anything else, however thery are taken down one by one. They attempt to eliminate rats at whatever cost until a surprising and twisted final that turns out to be the best moment of the movie . Mutants of a Nuclear Disaster !\n\nShort budget schlock revolves around some bikers , survivors seeking for shelter , when they find surrounded by a multitude of agressive rats, then gore and blood spelling everywhere . The main issue of the movie results to be the fights with flesh-eating rats , as they get rid some rats , but there are thousands and thousands , only to discover at the end they aren&apos;t the usual pesky critters. Stars unknown and usually secondaries actors as Massimo Vani and Ottaviano Dell&apos;Acqua, the latter is a regular Stunt and occassionaly playing bit parts. In some countries this &quot;Rats night of terror&quot; was presented as the third installlment of &quot;Bronx Warriors&quot; 1982 and &quot;Escape from the Bronx&quot; 1983 by E. G. Castellari , though I think of Rats has more relation with &quot;The new barbarians, warriors of the wasteland&quot; 1983 than the previous ones.\n\nIt contains an atmospheric cinematography by Franco Delli Colli who photographed several movies of B Italian genres . As well as thrilling musical score by Luigi Ceccarelli. The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Bruno Mattei who used the pseudonym Vincent Dawn. He often collaborated with Claudio Fragasso who directed the famous Trolls 2 . Mattei was a prolific and botcher Italian writer/director . This hack filmmaker made a lot of films in low budget and all kinds of genres, such as : Action Moviesc : Strike Commando , Terminator 2, Double Target. WIP Women in Prison : Emmanuele in prison, Caged Woman. Peplum : Seven Magnificent gladiators , Caligula and Mesalina. Naziexploitation: Casa privata per le SS. Spaghetti Western : Apache Kid, Scalps. Terror : Hell of the Living Dead, Terror in convent and this Rats night of Terror.",

      "reviewBody": "Julie Delpy excels in &apos;2 Days in Paris&apos; as she writes, directs, produces, composes the music and stars in this romantic bitter/sweet comedy. Opposite Adam Goldberg, who has amongst other things played psycho Eddie in Friends and Private Mellish in &apos;Saving Private Ryan&apos;, Delpy shines as the nerdy photographer who has trouble with her eyes. The two central performances and sharp script means the film flows along at a pretty fast pace with the one liners so frequent you could easily miss the odd one. The situations explored around relationships and family are universal and so easy for anyone to relate to, there are misunderstood physical situations and language barriers which all add to the overall melodrama/comedy unfolding on screen. The film is peppered with brilliant moments from the awkward to the bizarre and the laughs come thick and fast, with Paris as a backdrop the lovers weave in and out of one situation to another always in love yet always on the verve of break-up. Co-starring Delpy&apos;s real father as her in film father shows a sense of tightness and a labour of love that comes across in the finished product. Like a cross between something from Woody Allen and Amelie this film has a special naivety full of wonderment juxtaposed with the dark underbelly of life that is at times hard to escape. Whether you laugh or cry you can&apos;t fail to be moved by a film so simple in its execution of themes that can, as displayed, be so complicated. Delpy has made something she, and everyone involved, should be very very proud of.",

Of particular interest is the soundtrack; for a &apos;new idea at the time&apos; the soundtrack is surprisingly good, for example you hear the taunting voices echoing in the warden&apos;s mind in one scene. \n\nThe plot and acting are of their time, of course; one only needs to (say) listen to popular music of the time to see how certain cultural ideas have changed, but the language of cinematography it seems remains more constant.\n\nInterestingly this film was originally also released in a silent version; presumably many cinemas were not then sound equipped and it wasn&apos;t yet certain whether this &apos;new sound thing&apos; would just be a fad or not.\n\nFor something that should be completely anachronistic, a museum piece even, this is a surprising watchable film.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Adam Gierasch gives a mediocre to decent view on the remake of the 1986 film Night of the Demons. The release of this film has been tied up for a while due to the debate whether it should earn a theatrical or direct to DVD run. It finally settled on premiering at the London FrightFest Film Festival back in Halloween 2009 and finally was released on DVD this year. The film falls in the category of unnecessary remakes and as a film itself it just isn&apos;t that grade. Not only did the word &quot;remake&quot; turn me off but so did the word &quot;demons&quot;.\n\nWhen demons enter the picture trouble follows. Demons require a lot of pointless backstory. Unfortunately you need the backstory to understand the damn movie itself. It&apos;s like Final Destination, only it&apos;s much more easier to understand whats going on because, while not logical, is a strangely effective way for you to keep watching to show how odd these people die. Demons are fictional creatures and they involve spells, writings, and a history. It gets worse when people try to explain whats going on and it&apos;s like &quot;just give it up&quot; you can explain it twelve more times and it doesn&apos;t make an ounce of sense. In one scene they are in a room where supposedly the demons cant enter because of the writings on the wall. We never know what these writings mean or let what they even say.\n\nSince I haven&apos;t seen the original film, I can&apos;t judge it in any way, shape, or form. I&apos;m not even positive if both movies share the same plot. This version revolves around the sexy Angela Feld who is holding a party at the Broussard mansion, which is reportedly haunted by demons and other mythical beings. The party is filled with sex crazed, hormonal kids who just want a piece of the sex pie when suddenly the police come an invade the party, scolding the teens, and forcing them to vacate the area.\n\nA group of teens neglect to leave and then realize that now the gates won&apos;t opened and they are subjected to seclusion inside the creepy mansion. Though after an encounter with corpses in the basement, Angela and many others turn into blood thirsty demons that now feed on the lives of the innocent teenagers. As Roger Ebert would say, &quot;a dead teenager movie&quot;.\n\nWhile this remake is probably not as recognized as the 2009 reboot of Friday the 13th, it doesn&apos;t mean it doesn&apos;t exist. The original NOTD was popular during the 80&apos;s, but it is definitely overshadowed by slasher classics like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street. This remake does have something going for it though; insanely catchy metal soundtrack, some cute teenage girls, no CGI, no Michael Bay, and Eddie Furlong.\n\nIf Eddie Furlong wasn&apos;t in this film it wouldn&apos;t have been wouldn&apos;t have been half as good as it was. Reminds me of how Giuseppe Andrews made Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever and if he was absent the film would have been less than what it already is. Sly and sexy Shannon Elizabeth of American Pie and Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back too plays a good role in this film. It is quite fun to see her strut her stuff on set, even when she is a blood thirsty demon.\n\nIn no means does Night of the Demons qualify as a passable remake. I highly doubt the original film is like this. For what it is, it&apos;s definitely a remake in 2009 and nothing less. This is something Ill watch once and never touch again. This is the kind of film that sits on the shelf for weeks until the stock boy picks it up and says &quot;Who would leave this out?&quot; and throw it in the back where it would sit for years to come. That&apos;s a bit harsh, but Gierasch does little to impress with this mediocre remake of another 80&apos;s film. But Monica Keena gets my sympathy; first she is caught in the dueling duo of Freddy and Jason, now she&apos;s victim to demons? Someone take this girl FAR away from teen parties.\n\nStarring: Shannon Elizabeth, Monica Keena, Bobbi Sue Luther, John F. Beach, Edward Furlong, Michael Copon, Diora Baird, and Linnea Quigley. Directed by: Adam Gierasch.",

      "reviewBody": "In my opinion, House of 1000 Corpses is a fan movie. Fans of both the horror genre and Rob Zombie are likely to love it. Though I do not count myself a fan of either, I do like both at times, and I am quite familiar with both. Those familiar with Rob Zombie are likely to be the only ones who completely &apos;get&apos; this clever little film - appreciating its depraved sense of humor and nihilism. Zombie&apos;s themes are fairly consistent - evil (without the usual religious connotations and clichés), murder, sex, insanity, and stereotype &quot;hillbillies&quot;. Zombie&apos;s world is not a place for people who are terribly concerned with reality, but, for Zombie himself, it seems to supply endless muse for a prolific and interesting commercial creativity.\n\nTwo couples traveling across country and working on a book on bizarre roadside attractions stumble across a filling station / theme park run by a vaguely evil clown with a bad attitude - Captain Spaulding. Spaulding teaches them of a few local legends, including a mad surgeon who worked in a local insane asylum and came to be known as Dr. Satan for the grotesque surgical procedures he applied to mental patients in secret. They pick up a pretty blonde hitch-hiker on their way to see the tree where Dr Satan was hung, and run into some car problems, so the hitch-hiker invites them to her family house. The family, apparently headed by the phenomenally weird Karen Black, makes The Addams family look like the Brady Bunch.\n\nMy narrative has described the first 20 minutes or so of the film, and at this point the film, much like RZ&apos;s songs, is so campy that it seems a straightforward horror comedy. However, once our protagonists are in &quot;the house&quot;, the plot takes a decidedly more sinister spin, and never lets up from that point forward.\n\nThis film successfully and entertainingly portrays all of RZ&apos;s themes in about the same proportions as his music. Of them all, sex is the least explored, and I, for one, am thankful for that. The film also walks a delicate line between Hannibal Lector grotesque art realism and supernatural forces. For example, at one point, one of the bad guys turns on a cassette player with low batteries so that the voice recorded on it sounds extra-satanic.\n\nIf you have problems with blood and other bodily fluids, and utterly repulsive surgically induced variations on the human body, you might want to avoid this film. If you don&apos;t have any great objections to standard hardcore horror imagery, or if you like it, you might want to see this. It is masterfully visualized and does a much better job of making horror into art than the standard Hollywood horror fair. This is Rob Zombie&apos;s art, and he does it much better than most. This first major effort in film bodes well for his future use of the medium, and I will look forward to his next.",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen and quite enjoyed the Spanish original I was a bit concerned about seeing it remade. My concerns were unfounded though as it turns out since, while the director did use the general idea of the original, he did not so much do a remake as a spin off. The setting, characters, general plot, and ending all very significantly deviate from the original, and there is even a detailed back story added which creates, if not sympathy, at least comprehension for the acts this family does.\n\nThe movie itself is beautifully developed to create both a very plausible realism and very well defined characters. It is these characters that are the goal, and the movie does not resort to needless gore to satisfy cruder appetites. The acting is carried off quite flawlessly, and we do find ourselves at least rooting for the children to some degree. All in all it was well worth the watch.\n\nWould I say it is better than the original? Well, given that they are both very different it would be unfair to pit them against each other directly. I will say I did prefer the original overall as it was first, so it took some of the novelty out of the second, and the original made it more of a sort of very twisted coming of age tale than the second movie did, and I really liked that dimension of it. But if I look at them more as apples and oranges, I would say they both are very well done and each earns its place as a highly recommended piece of work.",

To watch the reactions of my fellow church members was amazing. Many sat in stun silence, while others just bawled openly.\n\nNow, all these years later, I can say this film is still probably the most powerful, and brutally honest film that I have ever seen. If you are a Christian as I am, this film shows everything that we ever need to see about Jesus&apos;s last 12 hours, but even if you are an atheist, this film is just plain powerful in the way it was made, and created.\n\nMel Gibson did as a Director in this film something I doubt that the great Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola, or Quentin Tarantino could never do.\n\nFrom the cast, to the direction, to the sets, to the costumes, I believe this is al near perfect a film as you will ever see."

      "reviewBody": "Holymotherofgod. This movie is amazing, a true testimony to the creative spirit of the human animal. That it makes no sense, is somewhat ineptly staged, recklessly plotted and lacks any redeeming social qualities makes it even more enjoyable. I watch it with the same kind of amazement that a newborn child regards it&apos;s mother&apos;s voice. I simply cannot believe I am lucky enough to exist at a time when movies like this have been made and privileged to have seen it -- which according to some intel I gathered is a collection of scenes from an obscure TV series that was released in Germany only as a feature film in this form.\n\nThe other guy did a pretty good job in summing up the story, which concerns itself with gigantic robots trying to blow stuff up and other robots who fight them. There are jet fighter attacks, an undersea headquarters, mod day-glow production design, an evil overlord villain who&apos;s hair lights up like the Heatmizer&apos;s, evil enemy henchmen dressed as football players who kick exploding footballs, and a heroic team of robot pilots who all wear identical fluorescent lounge suits with some sort of military insignia on the lapel &amp; have their own secret hand signals. In other words this is exactly the same movie I would have made when I was about eight years old, which ironically is when the film was released. Coincidence? Hardly.\n\nThe model effects work is cheezy and unconvincing, which heightens the surrealist nature of the film. It&apos;s sort of like a visual realization of an eight year old&apos;s fantasy as he plays with his robot toys and imagines them battling for world supremacy. The robots are alternately shown as either small models for close-up details or a stunt actor dressed in a costume approximating the designs for scenes like when the robots reach down to pick stuff up. One battle scene has them pasted to a revolving 33rpm turntable as their arms move up and down, a more convincing special effect than anything seen during the entire 140 minute runtime of ATTACK OF THE CLOWNS from Star Wars. The jump cutting is all fast paced and upbeat, with print damage to the home video version I saw inadvertently trimming vital expositional scenes that would otherwise have provided context for the action being shown. It is a vast improvement.\n\nThe home video version I found is also a marvel to behold, a (get this, if you can follow it) Greek made German language VHS of a movie made in Japan. If it&apos;s storage box had been made somewhere in South America it could represent some kind of U.N. committee studying global warming. I bought it on eBay in a public auction that anyone on the planet with an internet connection that isn&apos;t blocked by their totalitarian dictator government could have bid on. Nobody else did, so this video is proof that there are roughly three and a half billion people on this planet who don&apos;t have a clue. The VHS itself is worn, has a ratty fullframe transfer with dust scratches and missing frames and skallowag damage where small children were allowed to pull lengths of the video tape from the cassette and use it for craft projects. I wouldn&apos;t want to see it any other way, a proper DVD restoration would ruin this movie.\n\nTo sum up and provide a catch-phrase for some nerd hack writing for a dork print fanzine to steal from me without proper credit (an alarmingly frequent film review technique, I am afraid), &quot;SPIDER MAN 3 has nothing on this little baby&quot;, and I genuinely mean that with all due contempt for present day action/adventure/sci-fi/cult movie making. I would love to send a copy of this video to Sam Raimi and Quentin Tarentino so both could hang their heads in shame after allowing their careers to become so uninteresting. They should both quit their day jobs as media demigods and go back to working menial employment for peanuts and perhaps figure out how to make a movie again, artists always work best when under adversity. Which is exactly why I insist on continually eking out a marginal living: I do not want to loose my creative edge, and the brilliant minds behind this film likewise shared my same insistence upon remaining a failure who made great art. Thank god they bothered.\n\n8/10: Needed a mummy or perhaps some insert scenes with Jack Palance taken from another movie. Other than that it&apos;s perfect.",

Now I reckon the series has run (or drove?) its course ... and we do somewhat get back to square one - with a racing tournament of sorts.\n\nYou may want nun of that - but the nuns want some of it. More puns - I don&apos;t know if the movie does justice to my puns ... probably not. It might feel or be funnier than what some expect I reckon. The silly humor remains - and you have to know if that is something you can deal with or not. I did not rate any of those movies for the acting in it.\n\nPart of that is because they are sort of dubbed - back in the day (especially in the 70s in European cinema), they shot with everyone speaking in their native language. After that they were dubbed in the country the movie was released ... so tough to rate with different voices and all that.\n\nThe ending is anything but surprising in and of itself - but it did contain language that nowadays some would call &quot;woke&quot; ... so even 50 years ago people could be considerate ... or maybe it was meant a bit as a joke ... no matter what, it works.",

      "reviewBody": "Adventures from the Tsarist era with John Derek and Elsa Martinelli\n\nRussia around 1890: The honest Captain Alexej (John Derek) marries the beautiful Irina (Dawn Addams), but soon discovers that she has been seduced and impregnated by her nasty brother-in-law General Gorew (Wolfgang Preiss). Because of this blatant crime, Alexei takes a hard look at his abusive superior and is banished to Siberia for it. The beautiful Irina follows her husband there and is able to help him escape, but is killed in the process. Now Alexei is on the run from Gorew&apos;s nasty henchman Lisenko (Rik Battaglia), but finds refuge with the Volga boatmen around the &quot;Professor&quot; (Gert Fröbe). He also meets the beautiful Masha (Elsa Martinelli) there...\n\nAn upright officer of the tsar learns about the dark side of rule and the everyday needs of the common people. Although this production is a thoroughly Western European one, it still breathes in a lot of the Russian soul, like Carlo Ponti&apos;s large-scale production &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; a few years later. Wonderful!\n\nThe film was directed by Viktor Tourjansky and written by Damiano Damiani and Salka Quarter, who worked very closely with super star Greta Garbo in the 1930s.\n\nThe American actor John Derek (1926-1998) shines in the male lead role. After he had already attracted positive attention in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), he went to Rome to play leading roles in Cinecitta. In his private life, John Derek was married to a number of the most beautiful actresses: Ursula Andress, Linda Evans, Bo Derek. As a director in the 1980s, he staged the latter in such a piquant and provocative way (Tarzan / Bolero / Ghosts Cant Do It) that both repeatedly found themselves in the headlines. Regularly nominated for the Golden Raspberry, these films found their mostly pubescent audience ;-)\n\nThe leading female roles include the charming actresses Elsa Martinelli (Hatari!) and Dawn Addams (Come Dance With Me!). Since German production companies, Regina Film and Rialto Film, were also involved in this co-production, you can also see some German actors - as already mentioned. Ingmar Zeisberg, born in Danzig in 1933, deserves special mention as the humiliated wife of the bitter general. The impressive actress could later be seen in the well-worth seeing classic &quot;Schwarzer Kies&quot; (1960) and in the West German horror thriller &quot;Das Wirtshaus von Dartmoor&quot; (1964).\n\nThe French veteran Charles Vanel (1892-1989), who wrote many classics such as &quot;Le Salaire de la Peur&quot; (1953), &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1954) and &quot;La Verite&quot; (1960), also plays a smaller role as barkeeper ) has refined with his presence.\n\nClear recommendation!",

I found the story fascinating, the look stylish, and the music haunting.\n\n&quot;Wicker Park&quot; is a tale of obsession on many levels. It is told partly in flashback, so that you have to piece the events together and figure out how far back the action of the film began -- what is now and what was then. The director uses split-screen techniques that enhance the look and feel of the film, lifting it from the realm of the ordinary to the plane of art. A haunting theme weaves its way through this labyrinth of lies, leading to a satisfying (because inevitable) conclusion.\n\nI saw the film with two friends who were of a very different opinion. They found the film &quot;convoluted&quot; and &quot;clichéd&quot;. I disagree. It was easy to tell what was flashback and what was here-and-now. But the story is complicated (not convoluted) and does require some sorting out. As for being cliched, I found the film quite the opposite. It could have gone in some trite, hackneyed directions but didn&apos;t. And while some people might think the ending is the cliché of all clichés, I thought that, emotionally, it was absolutely right and the only possible way to end the film.\n\nI loved &quot;Wicker Park&quot; so much that I would willingly see it again, to get a better sense of how the story is put together, and just for the sheer pleasure of its look and sound. You might say I too am obsessed."

With a low budget of what it had to deal with it turned out very good.\n\nIt deals with post apocalyptic colony underground while it is constantly snowing outside. It is showing very well how people turn into animals in self defense. We had a similar situation in Sarajevo in 1992-1995. When society fails, community is either doomed or it receives help from outside. Since in this film there was no help from outside even the remnants of the civilization left in the colony were attacked by a gang of cannibals.\n\nIf you like sci fi post apocalyptic films this one is for you.",

Against all odds, she perseveres to convince the parents of the valuable lessons that can be learned through music. If you liked Mr. Holland&apos;s Opus, chances are that you will love Music of the Heart. Meryl Streep makes this movie work although she gets some acting help from Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett and Cloris Leachman. Even though it is a little overly dramatic at times, it still touches you with its message and its spirit."

Yet,I liked it.\n\nI was a little worried when it started out, it looked like it might get high-handed or overblown. It&apos;s a fine line between mythic and stupid, but the reviews on IMDb were all so glowing, I kept at it. The love story was engaging, very believable, and the conflicts were unique. The movie manages to drop on the mythic side of the line.\n\nOne thing I noticed: The values are all what we call Western. The individual over the group, the convictions of the heart over the traditions of the clan, etc., and there was no real question about it. The main character kind of reminded me of James Dean or Montgomery Clift. There was even some actual kissing, too, which I think is a Western thing.\n\nIt&apos;s well done. I especially liked the acting of the two leads. You might find itinteresting, as long as you don&apos;t mind the dark witchy stuff or the definitely R-rated violence.\n\nI&apos;m looking forward to Part II. I feel like I&apos;m crowding into the back of a big Hong Kong movie theater.",

      "reviewBody": "Only a poor soundtrack filled with contemporary music spoiled this latest version of The Great Gatsby for me. In a tradition of blond Gatsbys, Leonardo DiCaprio steps into the shoes of Alan Ladd and Robert Redford in essaying the part of the social climbing bootlegger from the Roaring Twenties. All that will make Jay Gatsby&apos;s life complete is the love of Daisy Buchanan whom he courted before his service in World War I. The problem is that she&apos;s slightly married to upper class Tom Buchanan. Daisy is played by Carey Mulligan and Buchanan is played by Australian player Joel Edgerton.\n\nIn fact except for DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway the whole cast is mostly Australian which is to be expected since most of the production was shot there. I have to say that the Australian studio did a marvelous job in recreating New York of the Twenties and the ritzy and glamorous part of Long Island where most of the story takes place.\n\nAs the book is written in the person of Nick Carraway it was also a good move to have Maguire narrate the story. Tobey&apos;s narration gives us the background of the story and Carraway&apos;s character functions as he should.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job playing the social climbing Gatsby who weaves his own legend as he gives fabled parties on Long Island where the illegal liquor flows freely. Beneath his self assurance there is a bit of a frightened edge like this is all going to be taken away from him so enjoy while you can. \n\nPerhaps the producers thought that no one would see a film with old music in it. There is some there, Gershwin&apos;s Rhapsody In Blue comes to mind. But the contemporary music on the soundtrack is jarring and out of place.\n\nBut overall this is a good telling of F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s tale of the Roaring Twenties.",

Tokyo Psycho isn&apos;t supposed to be Ju-On or Ringu. This is a cool ass, low budget j-horror flick. And as a trashy, freak out, straight to video (or DVD, or whatever they call it these days) exploitation flick it totally works. I dug the washed out, stark appearance of the high-rise setting. Most horror films these days go for that post-Se7en look  filthy and dank and decaying, which looks cool, but has kind of become visual shorthand that tries to make up for a lack of actual scary stuff (see crap set piece films like Saw for example) and, more importantly, doesn&apos;t really jibe with reality. Most of us deal with over-lit, over-modern spaces. That sexy, 70&apos;s lower east side NYC look just doesn&apos;t exist anymore, and defiantly not in a place like Japan. Totally freaky stuff is secretly scarier when it happens in brightly lit spaces.\n\nThis is totally a &quot;throw in the DVD player when you&apos;re hanging out drinking and kicking it with a bunch of people&quot; film. Not to be taken seriously, but still good, bloody low budget fun.",

      "reviewBody": "William Dieterle was himself a German, starting his career in Germany and going back to Germany to finish it. This was one of his last American films, and the puzzling thing about it is its rather palpable detachment from the subject. It is surprisingly formal, and yet Dieterle had made some of the most compassionate films ever made in America, like &quot;Love Letters&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; behind him. Here he is consistently cool, and not even Cosima Wagner is quite convincing with any warm and bleeding heart - in fact, she became notorious as the worst dinosaur in Europe after Wagner&apos;s death, which even Gustav Mahler had some problems with in his career. The one character in the film who is entirely convincing and makes the one sympathetic impression is Carlos Thompson as Franz Liszt - his quarrel with Wagner is almost the highlight of the film. Wagner himself is played by Alan Badel, one of the best English actors of the time, and you can almost sense some ambiguity in his relationship with the role as well. Wagner was after all the most controversial of all musical geniuses, and he confesses himself in the film that everyone is consumed by his fire, which Franz Liszt confirms in his definition of a genius as the devil. The film was made after the war, and no artist has ever been more misused by political propaganda than Wagner by the Nazis, who made him practically a god, and they were burned for it. The film is neat, it is well made, it is visually quite enjoyable, the acting is also good, while only king Ludwig II is not quite convincing - he was after all also a genius, and one of many who was betrayed by Wagner, which ruined him - nothing of that appears here. Most musical biopics are better, while only Dieterle&apos;s cool detachment in professional and impeccable style saves this one.",

      "reviewBody": "The life and times of songwriter Townes Van Zandt told through clips, interviews and his music.\n\nI always knew the name but never had any idea what he wrote. The one song you&apos;re probably most likely to know is Poncho and Lefty which was a hit for Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson And Merle Haggard. This documentary filled me in, to some degree, on the man and his music, but it never really made me understand the man any more than I did before. The film certainly didn&apos;t turn me into a fan of his. Townes was an amazing songwriter who said his songs were &quot;mostly sad and the rest are hopeless&quot;. He wrote, performed and then drank and did drugs in order to deal with his personal demons. I&apos;m really not to sure what those demons were, they just were sort of there, or so it seems from the movie. The movie isn&apos;t clear about many details in Townes life, its really just a portrait of the man as a person you might meet on the street, it doesn&apos;t really give you any sense of what he did (other than write songs) or when he did it. He had some kids and he had some wives, but there isn&apos;t really any attempt to sort that out, nor is there any attempt to give you any sense of what he did other than write songs (this is not a movie to see if you want dates and places) Its a good movie. Its not a great one. It does give you a sense of who this person was as if he were a random person, but it doesn&apos;t really tell us why he is so important and so well loved. For me its a bunch of people telling his story and saying he&apos;s great, but not explaining why. I enjoyed it, but I really wish I knew more about him other than he wrote songs.",

I need some money, I need some dough, for the things I want, for the things I own. I got Sticky Fingers!&quot;\n\nThe title song says it all. &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; is one of the most hilarious films ever made, and done so with such a style and even a type of elegance that has kept it fresh and funny for every viewing. Two roommates, and best friends Lolly and Hattie are struggling musicians, who can&apos;t pull in the attention of anyone past the civilians in Central Park, New York. One day, out of the blue, Diane, Hatties dope dealer, leaves them with a mysterious bag, with important contents inside. It is, yes, almost 1 million dollars. Eventually, everything is crazy, and all mixed up. These two women, who are honest, decent people in the Big Apple, are transformed by the green power slips, into petty, light-headed money grubbers. Soon the cash begins to run on, and the two have a lot of explaining to give Diane...and the mob men who have been watching their every move...\n\nHelen Slater is the not so bright Hattie. She surely gives a new name to the word &apos;energy&apos; in this one. With her quick and witty dialog, and sharp timing, she is amazing, and always turning on the laugh-machine. Melanie Mayron is the squeaky, nervous Lolly. Mayron is up to par with co-star Slater, giving off the same amount of energy and confusion. Needless to say, Christopher Guest is, as usual, a treat to watch as the love interest of Mayron. Other cast members include Loretta Divine, Eileen Brennan, Carol Kane, and an absolutely outrageous Danitra Vance, who steals the show with her every scene.\n\nThe comedy used in this gem is a bright blend of slapstick, and witty stand- up, with honesty as a key factor, bringing in solid goods. It is a shame that this one was never received as well as others in that time. The film is well representative of it&apos;s time,(1988) and it&apos;s pop-culture wackiness. I suppose it was the &quot;different&quot; factor that says just why the film was little known, if at all. This film does have a different tone, and even more so, it is very general. Sometimes, the smaller, more overlooked things are funny. Sexual lingo and politics are restricted, very restricted. This film is not &quot;Majoy League&quot; or a &quot;National Lampoon&quot; film, or even like any of the &quot;Porkey&apos;s&quot; movies either. It stands out completely on it&apos;s own, with ultimate originality and sharp comic texture and context, which make it a real riot to watch over and over again!",

The shots were grainy, the lighting was bad, and the widescreen dvd version was hardly widescreen at all. Apparently Patty McCormack has forgotten how to act, because she was quite good in the Bad Seed. The supporting cast does the film no better. The apparent parallels to the original only act as an insult, especially since the modern counterparts pale in comparison to the characters in which they were based (ex. the janitor at school trying to play LeRoy)  The effects were terrible, especially the gun shot scene, and the soundtrack was annoying. Why Patty McCormack passed up other offers before deciding to make this one is a mystery to me. It may have been a good idea on paper, but was executed poorly. This film can only be enjoyed for its camp quality, which in itself is hardly enough."

      "reviewBody": "This is often forgotten in Joan Crawford&apos;s filmography. It has lots of the ingredients of precode Hollywood, released a couple of month before the inception of the Production Code. It also has lots of the components of the films that Crawford made for MGM of the 1930s, but this one came relatively early in her career and thus seems fresh compared to later similar entries.\n\nSadie is the daughter of the cook in the home of the wealthy Alderson family. One night when helping out with the serving at dinner, she listens to the son and lawyer of the family (Franchot Tone as Michael) talking about how her boyfriend, Tommy Wallace, is a thief and should get no second chance from the community now that he&apos;s been fired from his job. Sadie tells them off and takes off with Tommy (Gene Raymond) to New York City. They have about twenty dollars between them, and pretend to be married to the landlady, planning to be married the next day. Sadie has a job interview, so she and Tommy agree to meet at city hall at noon and be married. He never shows. But this is not an Affair to Remember. Instead, it&apos;s exactly what you&apos;d suspect. Brassy nightclub singer Dolly Merrick hears Tommy singing in the boarding house bathroom and offers him a job singing in her act. But the audition would conflict with his wedding. Tommy picks the audition over the wedding, clears out his clothes, and doesn&apos;t even leave a note behind.\n\nSadie, now a hardened jaded woman, gets a job dancing in a night club act where she meets the very wealthy Jack Brennan ( Edward Arnold). He&apos;s drunk when he meets her, drunk when he marries her, in fact the guy is perpetually drunk to the point I get tired of him, and it is so hard to get tired of the talented Edward Arnold. The complicating factor is that Michael Alderson is Brennan&apos;s lawyer, thinks the worst of Sadie, and is still a pompous glass bowl, although he was right about Tommy having no character. Sadie can&apos;t forgive him for that either.\n\nThen comes the day when Sadie is told Brennan will die if he doesn&apos;t quit drinking, Sadie sees Tommy again and the old feelings surface, and Michael AND all of the servants think she is just a scheming tramp trying to let Brennan die drinking so she can become the rich widow. Complications ensue.\n\nThis film had lots of precode moments. There is the insinuation that Tommy and Sadie, in spite of their promises to each other to wait, do share a bed that one night they are in the rooming house. And there is the delightful Jean Dixon as Sadie&apos;s hard boiled friend who looks at the bedroom arrangements after Sadie marries Brennan and says &quot;I&apos;ve done a lot more for a lot less&quot;.\n\nRecommended if it ever comes your way. It packs a lot of plot into its running time.",

      "reviewBody": "Brokedown Palace (1999)\n\nWho wouldn&apos;t have some curiosity and tension about two pretty young women (played by pretty young actresses, anyway), trapped in a Thai prison system for drug smuggling? But boy is this a clunky construction for a movie. First of all, the women are stupid. They admit to being stupid, but they are selfish and frivolous and you really couldn&apos;t care less if they went to jail. On the other hand, you can picture being in a foreign country and losing track of things a little and getting victimized and so you do, after all, get involved and hope for justice.\n\nThere is (sometimes) a tense progression of increasingly discouraging events, and the prison system is a tough place. And the sets and filming are really great. If only the writing was remotely convincing and smart. It&apos;s not. Even the direction is painful, emphasizing not the facts or some sense of possible realism, but an armchair version of what this kind of scenario might mean to two relatively innocent girls is just a little embarrassing. The director (Jonathan Kaplan) is the same one who missed a huge opportunity with some amazing material filming In Cold Blood, and he is, understandably, most known for television, which takes a different kind of sensibility. And it&apos;s also very slow, taking a few turns or progressions and stretching a two hour movie out of it.\n\nIt&apos;s a tough ride if you take it at face value. And it&apos;s a shame, because there is a Midnight Express hidden in here somewhere. There are some really gorgeous moments, aside from the travelogue stuff, and I think Claire Danes, at least, is a good actress. Just an example of how many elements it takes to align and get a great movie.",

      "name": "Presentation is a bit amateurish but it builds its case well with a good range of experts, although the lack of a non-dissenting voice is notable",
      "reviewBody": "19 March 2003. Over three years now since &quot;we&quot; attacked Iraq and we&apos;re still there  with hundreds killed in insurgent attacks just the other day, no real end in sight and the US and UK politicians doing everything they can to work out how to &quot;cut and run&quot; without making it look like we&apos;re &quot;cutting&quot; or &quot;running&quot;. Ironic then that the majority of those who opposed the war want to stay and ensure we stabilise the region  just shows how sensible these people are because the worst thing we can do now is just give it all up as a bad job, we did it now we must pay the price  and with Iran now in a more powerful position in the region than ever, we have yet to really see what that price will be.\n\nAs many of my fellow &quot;cowardly liberals&quot;, I watched this film not to really learn something but just to feed my outrage at what has happened over the last five or so years in my name. I was surprised to see those reviewing this film attacking it for ignoring the weapons found and dismissing the film as having been overtaken by evidence discovered after the film was made (2004). Well, I suppose some viewers will have watched it just to pick holes at it. I want to review the film rather than the war but I will say that the case made in this film about the lack of WMD and the manipulation (putting it politely) of intelligence doesn&apos;t seem to me to have been a case that has been disproved. I&apos;m not sure if these people disagree with Bush&apos;s statement of Dec 05 where he said &quot;many intelligence agencies judged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and it&apos;s true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong&quot;, because it seems he is backing up this film&apos;s earlier claims. Perhaps these viewers also disagree with the Senate Intelligence Committee&apos;s findings in Sept 06 that &quot;Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda... refusing all requests from al-Qaeda to provide material or operational support&quot; and that &quot;Saddam issued a general order that Iraq should not deal with al-Qaeda - no post-war information suggests that the Iraqi regime attempted to facilitate a relationship with Bin Laden&quot;  again something this film claims as well, contrasting nicely with Cheney&apos;s assurances in Sept 03 that he had evidence of &quot;Iraqis providing bomb-making expertise and advice to the al-Qaeda organisation&quot;. This was the same Senate report that reported &quot;post-war findings do not support the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate judgement that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program&quot;. Those reviewers also seemed to find it very easy to dismiss David Kay but handily ignore that his replacement Charles Duelfer could find no evidence of movements of WMD out of Iraq and also could not find evidence of a weapons programme. The best he could come up with was evidence that Saddam had a pool of experts that could have been used to start such a programme  worrying perhaps but still light years from the claims made by Bush, Cheney, Blair et al.\n\nSo if you can know all the knowns we now know and still scoff at the idea that the Iraqi war was planned long before it was justified then this really isn&apos;t the film for you because you will only see this as liberal lies and dismiss it as such. Stepping outside of my politics as best I can, this documentary is pretty interesting in how it builds its arguments even if it is very one-sided and not really a discussion so much as a presentation. The opening credits are terrible and made it feel like a cheap TV special and the first 5 minutes spent introducing all the experts was pretty dull but after that the film moves quickly through several subjects using news footage of the Bush administration contrasted with comments and insight from an impressive range of experts. It is very one-sided of course but, unlike Michael Moore, this at least feels like it is a reasoned argument rather than bullying and pushing. Of course it is more enjoyable if you are the choir to be preached to but if there are any neutrals left this film should certainly make a good case.\n\nOverall then an one-sided documentary but a well handled one that brings together expert contributions to build a convincing argument about whether or not we were deceived into going into Iraq. Unlike those that criticise this film for being off-the-mark, I do think time has shown its arguments to be spot on. The delivery could have been a bit more professional but the way it builds its case is engaging and well done."

We saw it in IMAX in 3D and we were both blown away.\n\nAlthough this time the central character is a young boy - Hiro Hamada of the city of San Fransokyo - rather than two princesses, my granddaughter had no trouble relating to it because Hiro is so cute, his inflatable robot Baymax is androgynous, and two of his four friends - making up the six heroes - are very capable girls.\n\nI reckon that &quot;Frozen&quot; plus &quot;Big Hero 6&quot; - with a few films in between - will give her a lifelong love of the movies."

The excuses range from &quot;I Hate Black and White Movies&quot;, &quot;I Do Not Like Old Movies&quot; ,&quot;I herd this was stupid&quot;, &quot;I never Herd of this&quot;, and so many others.\n\nWell this film is &quot;Dated&quot; but its also part of its charm. This film stars &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot; and it is a delightful surprise. Think of this film as the inspiration for the &quot;Shrek&quot; films.\n\nIn this film A woman is about to lose her home. Stannie Dumb (Stan Laurel) and Ollie Dee (Oliver Hardy), live in a shoe (as in the nursery rhyme There Was An Old Woman Who Lived In A Shoe), along with Mother Peep (the Old Woman), Bo Peep (Charlotte Henry), a mouse resembling Mickey Mouse (and actually played by a live monkey in a costume), and many other children. The mortgage on the shoe is owned by the villainous Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon), who is looking to marry Bo Peep. Knowing the Widow Peep is having a difficult time paying the mortgage, Barnaby offers the old woman an ultimatum – unless Bo Peep agrees to marry him he will foreclose on the shoe. Widow Peep refuses, but is worried about where she&apos;ll get the money to pay the mortgage. Ollie offers her all the money he has stored away in his savings can, only to learn that Stannie has taken it to buy peewees (a favored toy consisting of a wooden peg with tapered ends that rises in the air when struck with a stick near one end and is then caused to fly through the air by being struck again with the stick). He and Stannie set out to get the money for the mortgage from their boss, the Toymaker (William Burress). But Stannie has mixed up an order from Santa Claus (building 100 wooden soldiers at six feet tall, instead of 600 soldiers at one foot tall) and one of the soldiers, when activated, wrecks the toy shop. Stannie and Ollie are fired without getting the money.\n\nI don&apos;t want to tell too much more but truest me the film is fast paced and its never boring. \n\nGive it a try!",

      "reviewBody": "My Architect by Nathaniel Kahn is that ancient story, the search for a man&apos;s father.  Nathaniel was the illegitimate son, the `bastard,&apos; of Louis Kahn, the architect who died in Penn Station, New York, in 1974 coming back from Bangladesh.  Kahn had three children, but only one by his wife; the second daughter and only son were by two other women.  The architect was a nomad and a man obsessed with his work.  He saw Nathaniel and his mother once a week, but Nathaniel never got to know his father well.  Lou Kahn died when his son was only eleven, and the secret children and their mothers weren&apos;t supposed to come to Lou Kahn&apos;s funeral, though they did.\n\nSo 25 years after his father&apos;s death, at the age of 36, Nathaniel set out to make this film to find out who his father was - and he has done an amazing and triumphant job.  He begins with a sketch of Kahn&apos;s origins, the fire that disfigured his face (it looked pock-marked), and his early displacement to America.  We learn about Kahn&apos;s development over time and the sources of his style.  They look back to the archaic and the monumental, not to anything his contemporaries did.\n\nNathaniel visits all the significant people and places in his father&apos;s life as well as a number of important architects. He starts out with `the man with the glasses,&apos; Philip Johnson.  Johnson talks about what a `nice guy&apos; Kahn was.  `All the rest of us were bastards,&apos; he says.  Johnson&apos;s point is there was a lack of jealousies or rivalry, a selflessness:  that focus on the work; it&apos;s also clear Kahn is a member of the Johnson pantheon..  I.M. Pei makes one thing emphatically clear:  he considers Kahn his superior. `It&apos;s quality, not quantity, that matters,&apos; he says rapidly and bluntly when Nathaniel suggests Pei was more `successful.&apos;  Kahn may only have completed a few buildings, Pei says, but they are great masterpieces.  Later in the film Frank Gehry says Kahn was his original inspiration, that without Lou Kahn, he would not be.  It&apos;s plain that the most famous architectural figures of our day are all in awe of this man. A failure morally, a man who couldn&apos;t do right by the people closest to him in his life, Louis Kahn is perhaps the greatest American architect.  That fact emerges as powerfully as do his personal shortcomings.\n\nNathaniel `interviews&apos; the great buildings, too, most beautifully and movingly.  His camera scans their spaces.  It peers at them far and near in different lights and shadows.  We even see him from far above, roller blading around the space encompassed by the Salk Center in La Jolla, casually making friends with and taking possession of it after an interview with the man Kahn worked with when the center was designed.  These viewings of the buildings, a revelation of the man&apos;s achievement, presented for the most part without commentary, are deeply moving both in and of themselves and in the context of the searching portrait of the man behind them.\n\nTo skip forward to the end:  in the film&apos;s final segment Nathaniel Kahn tells Shulyar Wares, the Bangladeshi architect, that his three days of photographing the government building at Dhakka, Kahn&apos;s last great project, will only yield at most ten minutes of film.  `Ten minutes!&apos; Wares exclaims. `You would try to do justice to this building in ten minutes!  To its spirit, its power, the ambiguities of its spaces!&apos; Wares then speaks about Kahn&apos;s achievement and character. It&apos;s not unusual for a great artist to fall short as a man, he says:  the one failure may be necessary for the other success. It&apos;s an eloquent, seemingly spontaneous speech, and a perfect finale to the portrait.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to do justice to this film without summarizing it scene by scene. It&apos;s the cumulative effect of the interviews, plus the fine photography and the brilliant editing, that all add up to an extraordinary portrait of a great artist and a flawed but complex man.  Nathaniel Kahn&apos;s simple bravery before the camera leads to a series of intensely revealing, often moving scenes with the people in Kahn&apos;s life. There are quite searching conversations with the two other women, including the filmmaker&apos;s mother. Nathaniel Kahn never falters or spoils the tone:  he isn&apos;t confrontational, but neither does he avoid hard questions.  He&apos;s serious, but without an ounce of self-importance.\n\nAnd while the interviews are powerful, they are paced by visits to the few but great buildings, whose effect at times is transcendent, and needs no inflated commentary from Nathaniel or anyone else.\n\nIt&apos;s astonishing how the film modulates from some rather petty remarks by men who worked with Lou in Fort Worth (who considered the architect impractical and airy-fairy) to the building that resulted, backed up by Beethoven&apos;s Ninth.  If you can look at a building with Beethoven&apos;s Ninth as background and the music seems right, you know it&apos;s a great building.  And this is the revelation of My Architect:  that Louis Kahn&apos;s buildings are magnificent, radiant visions of serenity, vastness, and beauty:  that they&apos;re among the artistic masterpieces of the twentieth century and we&apos;re fools not to go see them.  I for one plan to make the pilgrimage to La Jolla for the Salk Center as soon as I can.\n\nThe triumph of Nathaniel Kahn&apos;s documentary is its balance.  While the exploration of the buildings and the processes behind them goes along, so also the search for the secrets of Kahn&apos;s life continues through the course of the film. We realize that indeed as Wares says, Kahn&apos;s weaknesses and his virtues are inseparable. If he was a bit of a Don Juan, it&apos;s because he was a man of great personal charm, a man without poses or pretenses whom everyone liked - though sometimes they had to give up working with him to save their health and sanity, because he worked so relentlessly.  Neither of the `other women&apos; would have had it any other way.  The first found working with him tremendously rewarding despite the painful secrecy (she was an architect too), and the second, the filmmaker&apos;s mother, still believes that Lou was about to come and live with them when he died. And if Kahn was irresponsible toward women, he was passionately committed to his work, and the result is a lasting monument of triumphant buildings.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of footage of Kahn himself, so that his face, his stature, even the way he looked walking in and out of his offices in Philadelphia, are always a reality to us. It&apos;s appropriate that Kahn died in the huge train station, his address mysteriously obliterated from his passport.  He died as a nomad, exhausted from his great final project in Bangladesh, driven, isolated.  Nathaniel even managed to find and interview - in California! - the railroad employee who found his father&apos;s body in Penn Station 25 years before.  The whole film seems a combination of diligence and serendipity.  It&apos;s a homage with equal measures of passion and restraint.  Though a search for self in a way, it&apos;s selfless and compassionate."

      "reviewBody": "Nobody, least of all me, will argue about the visual beauty of this film. It is very well done with majestic scenes of nature as well as tight claustrophobic shots of a tormented man at work in his shuttered studio. As a period piece it comes across as very authentic, and I give it high marks for its sets &amp; costumes. So why didn&apos;t I like &quot;Painted Fire&quot;? Because I feel if you&apos;re going to do a film about an artist (or musician or writer or poet), of utmost importance is to convey exactly what drove, inspired and influenced the artist.\n\nExcellent examples include &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984) which showed Mozart being propelled by arrogance and perhaps moreso by his need to please and/or escape his domineering father. Or &quot;Frida&quot; (2002) shows that Frida&apos;s Kahlo&apos;s grotesque, often self-deprecating sexual paintings were the result of her dysfunctional romance and sexual subversion by her husband/mentor Diego. These films seek to explain the idiosyncrasies of the artists&apos; works by digging deep into the personality, the psychology and the philosophies that drove the artist. That&apos;s why I like to watch films about artists--to get insight that we don&apos;t learn from textbooks.\n\nHere in &quot;Painted Fire&quot; it felt more like a textbook reading of the life of Ohwon. It shows his base beginnings as an orphan who, in adolescence, joins the house of an aristocrat. Abruptly jumping ahead 20 years, it shows him as a frustrated drunk. He fights hard to divest himself of his vulgar origins but always swings back to his uncooth nature (drinking, womanizing). But why? What made him act the way he did? And how did it imprint the themes of his art? Not much of a connection is made; the man is shown to suffer from demons, but we are never shown what these demons are nor how they influenced his art. There are a few scenes where a peripheral character is whispering in the background about the symbolism in Ohwon&apos;s art (&quot;The bird symbolizes freedom...&quot;), but that&apos;s more of a broad cultural analysis rather than an analysis of Ohwon&apos;s psyche.\n\nI am a fan of Ohwon&apos;s paintings and have always been hypnotized by how beautifully he painted animals and the majesty of trees. In my mind I fashioned a painter who found great solace and order in nature while conspicuously avoiding human subjects. This could have been a great point to investigate in the film. Did he love animals? Did he fear humanity? None of this is in the film, and none of his paintings are explained. We just see a drunk, crass man who possesses a rare artistic talent. What a missed opportunity.\n\nAgain, contrast this against, say, a scene in &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; where Beethoven&apos;s reclusive genius is exposed as the result of his shame of being deaf and struggling to keep it secret. At the same time Beethoven is shown to have a great capacity to love, but explosively bitter when love is unrequited. In a scene he loses the love of his life because his carriage gets stuck in the mud on a stormy night, and as we watch the man&apos;s torment we hear his music &quot;Apassionata&quot; in conjunction with the frantic beating of the horses&apos; hooves. Every work of art has its particular motive, and it&apos;s always fun to learn what that motive is.\n\n&quot;Painted Fire&quot; does not give us motive. It left all my questions about Ohwon unanswered, presenting only a visual representation of what I already read in biographies. It gives us a good feel for what it was like to be alive in Korea in the late 1800s, it paints the culture and political unrest of a nation in flux. But none of this really seems to affect Ohwon. He is just a particle awash in this cinematic sea.\n\nI can definitely see how it would win at Cannes because, on a technical level it should wow any film connoisseur. But on a literary level--meaning the act of telling a story and theme--it did not satisfy me. For that, I return to the works of Kurosawa, Teshigahara and even modern Asian masters like Takeshi Kitano, because I love their ability to incorporate cinematic prowess with the poetry of thought. &quot;Painted Fire&quot; was not an unpleasant experience, but I can&apos;t say it did anything exceptionally good for me."

The story is told in flashbacks a lot,which is over used these days,but it does have the effect its supposed to without being confusing.(however because its so linear in its style it doesn&apos;t leave any great surprises. Its a watchable film with OK acting and OK script,which is a lot better than a lot of the stuff around these days so i was happy with it and gave a reasonable 6 out of 10,missing 7 only because it was reasonable rather than actually good.",

      "reviewBody": "Count Alfred (Maurice Chevalier) has disgraced his home country of Sylvania with one too many scandalous affairs with married women, and the ambassador of Sylvania commands him to return home. Alfred&apos;s manservant, Jacques (Lupino Lane), begs to come along, and his master relents. Alfred, burdened with a newly acquired French accent that makes him sound most un-Sylvanian, fears the wrath of his queen (Jeanette MacDonald). But instead of having him shot, she falls in love with him, and he with her. The entire kingdom, which has had nothing on its mind except seeing the queen get married, is thrilled. As Jacques and Lulu the maid (Lillian Roth) conduct their own romance, reveling in their commonness, Alfred discovers at the altar that his own marriage will be most uncommon - and a dire threat to his manhood. He may be marrying a queen, but he most definitely won&apos;t be a king.\n\nErnst Lubitsch directed this marvelous technical and artistic achievement back when other early sound films were still stumbling along. Four outstanding performances from four witty and charming performers (Chevalier, MacDonald, Lane and Roth) grace this lavishly produced musical comedy with its champagne-bubble songs and sexually-charged dialogue."

      "reviewBody": "Strait-Jacket(1964) a film starring Joan Crawford as a woman who comes home to find her husband getting busy with another woman. Joan snaps and kills both her husband and his mistress with an ax all to the watching eyes of her daughter who at the time was only 4 or 5. Fast forward 20 years and Joan&apos;s character is considered reformed and sent to stay with her daughter her brother and his wife. The rest of the movie revolves around deaths that occur at the house and if Joan&apos;s character is to blame or someone else.\n\nThis is a pretty cool flick all around as it has an ax wielding psycho Joan Crawford, Leif (Invasion from Mars) Erickson and George (Breath Assure) Kennedy giving us a very &quot;heady&quot; performance. It also has some sequences for its time that would have probably made the teeny boppers of the era squirm up to their man in the theater.\n\nAll in all I think this is one of those films that if your a horror/thriller fan you owe it to yourself to at least check out once as it does what is trying to do effectively even though you can see the end coming before you get there. With the characters all in place and an interesting story I give Joan&apos;s Ax Wielding flick: 7/10 good.\n\nStrait-Jacket is out now on Tri-Star DV. Definitely give it a go!!!\n\nUntil next time folks here is a tip: If your married and you want to cheat on your wife make sure you leave the ax locked up real tight in the shed cause if you don&apos;t you could lose more than your money if she catches you!!!\n\nI&apos;m out!!",

      "reviewBody": "John Waters&apos; movies are perhaps acquired taste (read: first class TRASH!), but &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; is a fairly accessible and comical romp, complete with great music, very likable performances and a moody 50&apos;s atmosphere. Obviously mocking &quot;Grease&quot;, the story is set in a Baltimore high school where teen idol Johnny Depp leads the &quot;Drapes&quot; thug gang versus the chic and fancy &quot;Squares&quot;. The hormones work at maximum power and Depp&apos;s character inevitably falls for the most popular square-girl in school. Arguments like these can only be settled with rough fights anddance contests! Johnny Depp and Amy Locane are both great in their lead roles, but it&apos;s the supportive cast that impresses the most. More particularly ex-porn star Traci Lords, Kim McGuire as Hatchet-Face (you can&apos;t but stare at her grimaces), Iggy Pop and Ricky Lake (as Depp&apos;s wild sister in a constant state of pregnancy). The gags are more tasteful than usual but all John Waters&apos; trademarks are still present. &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; is a strangely sexy film that&apos;ll definitely bring a smile on your face. Recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "Brain from Planet Arous, The (1957) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nSilly sci-fi tale of a scientist (John Agar) who goes into a new cave to see what made it and discovers that it was a large brain (with glowing eyes) from outer space. The brain takes control of his body in hopes of learning the various secrets of Earth but fear not because space also sends a good brain to help. Just reading a plot like that lets you know that you&apos;re watching a &quot;B&quot; movie from the 1950s that probably thrilled and scared thousands of kids who were taken to the drive-in by their parents. When seen today these movies certainly don&apos;t have the ability to scare and more likely than not they&apos;re laughed at due to how melodramatic their story lines are. THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS isn&apos;t a very good film but there are a few good things that make it worth viewing. Needless to say, with such a low budget the special effects really leave a lot to desire and this includes our friend, the deadly brain. The effect of the brain is quite simple but my one real question is why on Earth they decided to give the thing eyes. The site of a flying brain is silly enough but to then give it eyes wasn&apos;t really a smart move but it does provide a few laughs. Another silly aspect in the story is that Agar&apos;s character becomes possessed by this thing and is given the ability to blow things up with his eyes. There are scenes towards the end when he&apos;s showing the government his &quot;power&quot; and you have to wonder why they all just sit around and let him do this stuff without even attempting to stop him. Speaking of Agar, he&apos;s certainly the main reason to check this film out. Fans of the genre are certainly going to know him from his countless entries into the genre but this here is a rather unique way to see him. For the most part he was always playing the good guy trying to stop the evil monsters but here he gets to play a real jerk and he does a wonderful job with it. There are several scenes where he&apos;s abusing his girlfriend (Joyce Meadows) and they&apos;re actually quite effective. I thought the actor did a very good job playing bad and it&apos;s a shame he wasn&apos;t given more opportunities to do this. Meadows is decent in her role of the love interest but you have to admit that she&apos;s one of the dumbest girlfriends from this era of films. Robert Fuller, Henry Travis and Thomas B. Henry co-star. Fans of the genre will probably want to check this out simply for the silly nature of it but I&apos;m sure most others will want to skip it and check out something better."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Sleight&quot; brings the story of Bo. As the movie opens, someone is leaving a voice mail message for Bo, expressing sorrow for the passing of Bo&apos;s mom. We then jump &quot;One Year Later&quot;. Bo is doing various magic tricks for money. During one of those street performances, he meets Holly. We also get to know Bo&apos;s little sister Tina, whom he cares for. But then we find out that Bo is also selling drugs as part of a drug gang headed by Angelo. It&apos;s not long before Bo is in way way over his head. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you&apos;ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the debut feature length movie of writer-director J.D. Dillard. Dillard does a wonderful job mixing two genres (drug drama, magic tricks) in a story that is quite original in its approach. &quot;Anyone can do a trick, but I am a magician&quot;, comments Bo to Holly. I have no idea whether the magic we see in the movie is even possible, or whether it&apos;s all jut part of the story but not realistic. All I can say is that it looked quite good. The movie is helped enormously by the charming performances of the two leads: Jacob Latimore as Bo, and Seychelle Gabriel as Holly. Surely we will hear more from them! Last but certainly not least, there is a great electronic score from Charles Scott IV, which I intend to check out at some point.\n\n&quot;Sleight&quot; opened to positive acclaim at last year&apos;s Sundance Film Festival. No idea why it has taken so long for the movie to be released in theaters, but better late than never. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. That said, keeping in mind the movie&apos;s production budget was a mere $250,000 (peanuts in Hollywood terms), the movie has grossed many times that amount. If you are in the mood for a different type of &quot;drug crime&quot; movie that comes with a healthy twist of magic, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. &quot;Sleigh&quot; is highly recommended!",

In Gloriavale, nobody has to deal with everyday troubles of &quot;worldly people,&quot; including having individual bank accounts and a 9-5 job, but they somehow all get along well as the men learn to be mechanics and disciplinarians and the women learn how to have scores of children and cook and clean for hundreds of cult members.\n\nFor those familiar with cults, Gloriavale teems with red flags - signs of mind control, coercion, and sexual abuse are dotted throughout. On the other hand, those who are new to Christian fundamentalist &quot;communities&quot; may miss these signs, instead taking the narrator&apos;s word that these people live simply, but happily.\n\nIf you find yourself watching this series, do yourself a favor and Google this group afterwards. You&apos;ll find many dark and disturbing facts that are entirely absent from this series. The commentary is excessively laudatory to the point of suspicion. Don&apos;t believe everything you watch. Doing your homework, especially in these types of cases, is critical if you want the full picture.",

      "reviewBody": "Billionaire Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is on top of the world until he runs into a problem he can&apos;t solve, Cancer. His only hope is a new medical procedure called &quot;shedding,&quot; in which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After Damian undergoes this procedure, he becomes a man named Edward (Ryan Reynolds). Once he attempts to start a new life in New Orleans, he starts to become ravaged by visions of his new body&apos;s past. As he begins to investigate the origin of his new body, he learns the lengths that his creators will take to protect their procedure and keep their identities secret.\n\nThe film, I will admit, introduces an original concept that not many films have covered. It&apos;s a shame that it does not stay with it for very long. We start off with older Damian coming to terms with where he is in his life and with his condition and then the film pivots to more of an action film as younger Damian/Edward investigates his roots through his visions and survive its resistance. It was a shame that more time wasn&apos;t spent with the older version of Damian. This loss created a void in the story. It would have been better if we could have spent more time with him so his character could be more developed. From the little we got to see, he appears to not be that great of a person. If we knew more, we would have reason to root for him. The time spent during an unnecessary sequence in the middle could have helped with that. There is a lack of consistency in the character of Damian as well. The character is played by 2 different actors but their performances are not the same. There seems to not be any apparent, similar, alignment in mannerisms between the two Damians, they don&apos;t act too similarly either. That could either be because of writing, Ryan Reynolds&apos; performance, and/or not too careful direction. The film had the chance to try to answer some philosophical questions relating to the value of human life or the morality of valuing a life over. When you start to wonder if this whole &quot;shedding&quot; procedure is even possible, you are forced to accept that it is. Instead of being about Damian coming to terms with his new body and life, it chooses the path of gun fights and car chases. This is the moment when the film falls into the realm of mediocrity. It isn&apos;t revolutionary. The twists will not come as much of a surprise either. The film managed to keep my attention but I would of preferred it to cover more of the philosophical issues relating to the procedure. The film has a good idea but it could have been portrayed in a different/better way.",

      "reviewBody": "A young woman comes to believe she is responsible for a series of gruesome murders due to a family curse. Disappointing mystery film from Universal falsely advertised as a horror movie. It&apos;s even included on their Wolf Man Legacy DVD set. The movie is not a horror film and features no werewolves or other supernatural occurrences. I can excuse the disappointment over the misleading title and judge the movie on its own merits. What I can&apos;t excuse is that, as a mystery, it&apos;s decidedly predictable and unexciting. There&apos;s no suspense and if you can&apos;t predict who the killer is, congratulations on seeing your first movie ever.\n\nJune Lockhart, years from being immortalized as one of the great TV moms, plays the lead character as doe-eyed and dull-witted. Her childish belief that she is a serial killer is backed up by no reason. So the audience neither feels tension that she might be the killer (we know she&apos;s not) nor sympathy for her since she&apos;s so dense. The supporting cast is nice, as it almost always was with Universal in the &apos;40s. Don Porter, Dennis Hoey, Sara Haden, Lloyd Corrigan, Jan Wiley are all fine. The Universal &quot;look,&quot; as well as a nice supporting cast, make it watchable for fans. But I doubt casual viewers will find much of interest here.",

Sophia Loren, (magnificent), is Filumena, the Neopolitan prostitute, and Marcello Mastroianni, (also superb), the rich patron who strings her along for years, always finding an excuse not to marry her.\n\nIt is, of course, a comment on Italian machismo and of the subservient role of women in Italian society so perhaps the comic possibilities of the plot might escape a non-Italian audience, (comedy was never De Sica&apos;s strong point). Still, Sophia was never more radiant than she is here, so what&apos;s not to love, (she was Oscar-nominated), and De Sica does manage to keep the potential for sentimentality at arm&apos;s length. Unfortunately, the film isn&apos;t as highly thought of as it once was and isn&apos;t much seen today.",

I was able to see this version when I visited the US and found it in a small-town video store. The english voices pretty much ruined the movie.\n\nThis is no reason to give the movie a low rating however, since the movie in it&apos;s original form was an amazing breakthrough in Dutch film making. This movie&apos;s rating would be much higher if it was only rated by it&apos;s intended, dutch audience."

      "reviewBody": "I had read the book as a child and was swept up in the depiction of lives lived hidden away in the attic of a factory in Amsterdam, the strong true voice of Anne in her diaries capturing a world of imprisonment, the only crime being that of the wrong religion. Anne&apos;s spirit is never quenched as she experiences all the trial and tribulations of burgeoning adolescence, difficulty with her mother and a slow falling in love with a teenage boy, Peter, who shares her quarters.\n\nThe book was made into a successful play and then transfered to the screen where it was shortened considerably from the original. And that is where I saw it first, on the screen, but the shorter version, not being aware of the original length.\n\nThe cast are amazing, particularly Millie Perkins, who was the least experienced of all the cast and has to be in almost every scene. She candidly shared her experience of the six months&apos; filming when the cast was virtually in captivity and mentioned in passing that the most difficult time she had was not surprisingly with the director, George Stevens, who was extremely supportive but rather with Joseph Schildkraut, who plays Otto Frank, her father in it. He made her life hell on set and never let her forget she was totally inexperienced, unlike the rest of them, in the way of acting. I&apos;m mentioning this as not an inkling of this tension comes across on screen, and Millie has to share a lot of loving scenes with Joseph. Only a gifted actress could overcome her distaste for the man and perform as she did.\n\nThe expanded version of the movie is remarkable. It engenders a claustrophobic feeling in the viewer and an overwhelming sadness, knowing that none of these characters, apart from Otto, will survive the madness of the camps.\n\nAnne&apos;s positive spirit drenches every scene, she believes in the intrinsic goodness of everyone in spite of everything.\n\nShelley, as Peter&apos;s mother, deserved her Oscar, she conveys her unhappy marriage, her reliance on the material, her love for her son, so well. Diane Baker, as Margot, Anne&apos;s sister, hands in a great performance as does the above mentioned Joseph. Ed Wynn, breaking type, plays Dussell the dentist as an irritating busybody.\n\nIn the way of the Oscars, so many superb movies fail to attain the best picture of the year. This is one of them. That year, the best picture Oscar went to Ben Hur. This is a far superior movie.\n\n9 out of 10. Superb, especially in the restored length. Not to be missed. B&amp;W at its finest.",

He has an eye for detail with interesting stories to tell, as it&apos;s the case with this one.\n\nThe story presented here is credible. It is what happens after a loved one has met a horrible death, as it is in the case of Antonia&apos;s husband. Obviously, what appeared to be a happy marriage on the surface was a bit more complicated than we are let to believe at the beginning of the movie.\n\n Don&apos;t ever fool around with a woman&apos;s curiosity! Antonia can&apos;t rest until she delves deep into the clues left behind a painting. She embarks into a journey of discovery that will ultimately lead her to learn a horrible truth. \n\nAntonia meets Michele who, obviously, is someone who turns out to be a mirrored image of her. That&apos;s why is so easy to comprehend the situation. She gets our sympathy because instead of fleeing in horror, she wants to know more to get it clearly in her mind.\n\nMargherita Buy is very effective as Antonia and Stefano Accorsi&apos;s Michele is one of the best roles he has played in a while.\n\nCredit has to be given to director Ozpetek by keeping things in rein without making the story into a soap opera.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s an interesting drama developing about halfway through this movie until it suddenly becomes a little comedic war movie. Well, I think Ford was at a period in his career where he had really tried to do something different with The Fugitive, got slapped down hard by critics and the movie going audiences, and just retreated into crowd pleasers. When Willie Came Marching Home isn&apos;t a bad movie by any means, but it&apos;s so light, frothy, and ultimately unfocused that it&apos;s not really good either. It&apos;s okay. It&apos;s mildly entertaining for 82 minutes.\n\nIt&apos;s 1941 in Punxsutawney, West Virginia and William Kluggs (Dan Dailey) is just another guy in the town, practicing with his band in the back of the local drug store because it&apos;s owned by the father of one of his friends, and he has a girl, Marge (Colleen Townsend). When news reaches the small town of the attack on Pearl Harbor, William is the first in line to volunteer to enlist for the armed forces. His town is ever so proud of him, throwing him celebrations for his desire to serve his country. On top of the world, he tells Marge&apos;s younger brother Charlie (Jimmy Lydon) that he&apos;s not old enough to join up and that he needs to let the older guys take care of the Japanese. Basic goes well, especially when his drill sergeant discovers his incredible skill as a gunner, and he&apos;s ready to be shipped off to war. The train back east from boot camp makes a stop at a familiar place, though, and William finds himself back in Punxsutawney with a twelve hour leave before they continue on. Feted again, he&apos;s still king of the town.\n\nThat is, until he finds out the next day that he&apos;s going no further. He&apos;s being stationed at the base five miles away as a gunner instructor for airmen. Two years pass as news reaches the United States of Patton&apos;s movements through Africa and beginning up into Italy, but William just stays on base, always asking to go and always being denied, granted medals of Good Conduct instead, and going home on a weekly basis for dinner. His star has faded in the town, and he&apos;s gone from hero to object of derision.\n\nUp until this point, I was mildly entertained, but there were about two minutes where I thought this movie was going to turn into another hidden gem of a find, lost in the bulk of Ford&apos;s length body of work. Charlie has gone to war, joined the navy and fought in the Pacific, given a weeklong furlough back home. There&apos;s a celebration in Charlie&apos;s honor that William reluctantly goes to. Charlie is regaling the older members of town, who all saw action in World War I, with his tales of action, and Charlie has nothing against William&apos;s experiences during the war, knowing how dangerous student pilot missions can be. However, the elders are dismissive of William and push him away, shutting him down when he tries to relate experiences that were as life threatening as Charlie&apos;s. Dejected, he leaves the party. I really, honestly, thought the movie was going to pursue this line for the rest of the runtime, and I was prepped.\n\nThat&apos;s not what I got, though. William&apos;s efforts to go into combat finally come true when he volunteers as a last second replacement belly gunner for a flying fortress destined for England, and the movie becomes something close to a slapstick comedy. William falls asleep upon the aircraft&apos;s approach into England, stymied by heavy fog that leads the crew to abandoning the plane, pointing it directly south, and leaving William aboard on accident. When he wakes up, he jettisons as well, ending up in the hands of French Resistance fighters. After proving his Americanness by answering questions about who Mickey Mantle plays for and such, he witnesses the launching of a German rocket that Yvonne (Corinne Calvet) has filmed. He then has to become the vessel for getting the film back to England for British intelligence through getting drunk at a wedding, riding a torpedo boat through enemy fire, onto a motorcycle to London, and finally delivering the intelligence to command personnel.\n\nHis adventures aren&apos;t over yet as he must report to the American command in Washington which includes a flight in a fighter plane all the way back across the Atlantic, robbing him of any sleep over the eleven hours that precede several tellings of the same story to different personnel in the Pentagon, leading to a temporary stay in a psych ward before he escapes onto a train that lands back at Punxsutawney where he gets praise for his top secret work that he accidentally came upon.\n\nIt&apos;s a slightly entertaining way to give William his victory in the eyes of the townspeople who had begun to deride him for not contributing, giving him a wildly eventful three days that ends with him back in his own living room. It&apos;s not hilarious or anything, not the kind of ratcheting up of comedy that something like Billy Wilder&apos;s One, Two, Three is, but it&apos;s fine. I would have been okay with the film using the dramatic center point of the film as a turning point into making the film overall an outright laugh riot, but I never had more than a mild grin on my face.\n\nIt&apos;s a fine little movie, mostly lost amidst the years of the Cavalry Trilogy, and it&apos;s easy to see why. In the middle of three John Wayne westerns, a little movie about a guy who can&apos;t get into World War II just feels wane.",

When Terry (Crowe) explains to Alice (Ryan) how he started out in the Australian Army, but left for the British Army because there wasn&apos;t enough action...he was stating a very plausible possibility. The British Army does indeed accept recruits from Commonwealth nations. Terry also says he is veteran of the elite British Special Air Service, and again, it is true that a huge proportion of ex-SAS members end up in private security efforts of various kinds. When the big raid is carried off, the costumers took enough care to dress Terry in British DPM fatigues, while the American Dino (Caruso) wears American BDU fatigues. Again, this is plausible as these are the sorts of fatigues both men took with them when they left military service. I&apos;ve seen a lot of reviewers here criticize the end raid sequence.\n\nI found the actions scenes very good and a welcome change from most movies. Terry and Dino actually plan for covering fire from higher ground, fields of fire, etc. So many military raids in movies (The Dogs of War is a good example) just have the characters march out in the open and fire from the hip, with no seeming plan of movement other than to run around, destroy stuff, and look dramatic. Terry and his team never stuck around any longer, nor killed any more of the guerrillas, then necessary to rescue the hostages and escape.\n\nI can see where these details failed to find appreciation with the general viewing public, but I only hope others doing such movies continue to try to be authentic and realistic."

      "reviewBody": "This is partly inspired by the real life murderer Ed Gein. Ezra is a middle aged momma&apos;s boy. He&apos;s also a pet moron.Mommy is a raving twisty herself as she is a zealot and always preaching about &quot;dirty women&quot;(finest kind).So when mom drops dead old Ez starts to get lonely.\n\nWell Ezra starts hearing mom&apos;s voice after a year. She&apos;s lonely &amp; so is he. He digs her up and brings her back home where everybody is happy.His neighbors try and set him up with a woman.This is a really funny scene as his date tries to seduce him. She&apos;s kind of crazy herself and tells Ez that her dead husband wants them to play beneath the sheets. Well, she winds up under the sheets permanently.\n\nEz starts digging up the graveyard and bringing mom some company.He also starts semi stalking a waitress.Finally he sandbags her, brings her back to his place and it gets wild from there.She finds herself trussed to a chair with a table full of rotting corpses.Ez is dressed in the skin of a dead woman.There is no way out of this house of hell.\n\nEz really goes off the deep end on a trip to town. It involves a rifle, a young girl and a harrowing chase through the woods.This is another gripping scene that spirals into complete madness.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks. This movie could have done without the narrator.When he popped up it seemed like we were in a different movie.Old Ezra is the most sympathetic person in the movie.Everyone else is cruel, stupid or as nutty as he is.\n\nOn the upside Roberts Blossom gives a great portrayal of Ezra. You feel for Ezra and can really understand his madness.There are many shocking and disturbing scenes in this movie. But it uses suggestion rather than out and out gore.It looks rather tame compared to slasher flicks but that&apos;s why this is better. I had to wait 25 years to see this film and all in all it was worth the wait.",

What it doesn&apos;t do, like so many other &quot;documentaries&quot;, is steer the viewer into any one direction, it shows the good, the bad, and the ugly on all sides of the issue. It&apos;s particularly interesting to see the self serving side of the Teamsters representation, they&apos;ll promise anything to the rank and file, but will only come through if it&apos;s politically advantageous to them. If you can view this documentary without any pre-conceived notions, it&apos;s an excellent window into the politics of strikes and unions. The conclusion I came to, is that the workers are used as pawns by both management and the Teamsters, and in the end, the workers are the ones who pay the harshest price. It&apos;s a very good documentary, which presents footage of the events as they&apos;re unfolding, and leaves the conclusions up to the viewer and open to discussion.",

      "reviewBody": "Death Of A President is an excellent film and is in no way anti-American or Anti-George Bush. It has great cinematography, an interesting and very plausible story line, and exceptional performances. Whether you&apos;re left, right, center, or none of the above, this is a a very good film for the thinking movie-goer. \n\nThe controversy, of course, stems from the use of the current U.S. President as the victim of an assassination. The assassination scene itself flies by and can&apos;t be more than 2-3 seconds long, so fast, in fact, you can be forgiven if you miss it altogether. It&apos;s what precedes and follows that scene that is the meat of the movie. Film footage of Bush and other real political figures is spliced seamlessly into this film, and includes footage of Vice-President Cheney and Mayor Daley of Chicago. None of these real persons are in any way abused or mis-characterized in the film. And the portrayal of fictional FBI agents, Chicago Police officers, and White House and Secret Service officials is, if anything, mostly very complimentary to them. This film does not do a hatchet job on anyone \n\nWhat the use of real characters in a fictitious scenario allows the film-makers to do is to let the movie-goer realize that real actions have real consequences. And by putting real persons into a totally fictitious plot the film-makers can develop an accurate scenario - something that still can&apos;t be done with the Kennedy assassination of more that 40 years ago. We can&apos;t present an accurate portrayal of that real event even now because of the doubts cast on the whole event by the actions of our own government. The USG botched the assassination investigation so badly with its lies of omission and commission, that we will probably never know that whole truth about what happened that day in 1963. With the fictional scenario of Death of a President, though, we know exactly how things play out.\n\nWhether you are a President, an assassin, an FBI agent, or just a movie-goer, realizing that actions have consequences - often unforeseen consequences, of course - is something we all need to be reminded of from time to time.",

      "reviewBody": "There is something extraordinary about the two leads in this movie. Vincent Martinez was initially quite appalling to look at - scrawny, brooding with features more akin to a caricature!  However, as the film progresses, one can sense a certain charisma and physical presence that he projects more and more palpably; yes, even from a man&apos;s perspective.  But that&apos;s as far as it goes for him...\n\nAs for Isabelle, my!  What an actress, what a woman!  These French actress: Catherine Deneuve, Adjani, Beart - very few Hollywood actresses can be placed in the same league as them.  This is my first time seeing Ms Huppert perform and I was really blown away.  She brought so much contradicting sides to her character and she made them so believable.  The character is strong in career and personality, yet vulnerable in her devotion to the above-mentioned man-animal.  She is decisive and purposeful in life choices of career, marriage and the man-in-her-life yet defers constantly to the whims and fancies of him.  You get the picture!\n\nAnyway, with one single long shot of her face as betrayal, despair and sadness climax into a single track of tears - extraordinary!  No self-pity, no cloying sentimentality; just plain sadness at the state of affair....At first glance, she did not appear extraordinarily beautiful.  But as the film progresses, she looked increasingly radiant and one can&apos;t help but feel drawn to her.\n\nOne of the best film I&apos;ve seen at this year&apos;s film festival where more is said through pregnant silences than confrontations and accusations a la Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "Tarr returns after a long absence. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not up to par. Well, I should say, I have much of the same problem with this film that I do with all of Tarr&apos;s films. I&apos;m certainly not his biggest fan anyway. I love his aesthetic, and would definitely call him a genius just for his visual prowess. It&apos;s so extremely original. And he&apos;s so good at setting mood, although I should say that the mood of all of his films, at least his later, more well known films, is pretty close to the same. Dark, cold, lonely, the drudgery of life, etc. But as soon as the characters start to speak, I stop paying attention. I find most of the actual words of Tarr&apos;s films uninteresting, and, when the characters are talking, I start to realize that I don&apos;t find these people that interesting. They may look interesting, as Tarr captures their essence in severe close-ups, but they never say anything interesting. The Man of London unwisely adds plot to the mix. Tarr&apos;s earlier films have a wonderful meandering quality, where it feels like he&apos;s just capturing people going about their lives. That is true here to an extent, but this one has a pretty clear plot structure, and one that&apos;s been told often before: a man finds a pile of money that belongs to crooks, and he pays for it. It&apos;s not plot driven by any means, but that skeletal plot is followed, and it makes the film less interesting than Tarr&apos;s other films. Also, Tilda Swinton shows up as the protagonist&apos;s wife in what amounts to a cameo (she has about five minutes of screen time in this 2 hour and 12 minute film), and it&apos;s pretty distracting. There&apos;s a cute little nod to Satantango at one point, where people in a bar dance like they did in that behemoth. Also, the little girl with the cat from Satantango shows up as the protagonist&apos;s daughter. It&apos;s weird, because she looks exactly the same, except she&apos;s a woman now. A very, very creepy woman. Who probably still kills cats when nobody&apos;s looking.",

      "reviewBody": "Although the 60s and 70s are thought of as the age of feminism, it wasn&apos;t really until the 80s that women really achieved a bit of equality in movie land. But this being a less radical time, the dramas about powerful women tended to be a synthesis of Women&apos;s Lib and Reagan era entrepreneurial optimism. This is after all what success meant in that decade. But of-its-time as it is, Working Girl is still an entertaining and uplifting picture.\n\nWritten by Kevin Wade, Working Girl is a nice, neatly-constructed story. On a broad level it could be seen a black-and-white tale of good guys and bad guys. But what saves the characters from appearing one-dimensional is that they are written with a great deal of knowing realism. Who hasn&apos;t worked for a boss like Sigourney Weaver&apos;s character, or been cheated on by a jerk like Alec Baldwin&apos;s? One thing that keeps Working Girl engaging is that, while not an out-and-out comedy it is often tentatively funny in the way that real life is funny, such as Alec Baldwin&apos;s futile claim that &quot;This isn&apos;t what it looks like&quot;.\n\nThe effectiveness of Working Girl often hinges on the way its characters are projected. On paper, Tess McGill isn&apos;t necessarily sympathetic, and neither is Katherine Parker necessarily unpleasant, at least not in the first half of the movie. However, Melanie Griffith portrays the lead with enough drive to appear credible as a go-getter, but all wrapped in a kind of sensitive charm that makes her likable. It&apos;s lucky she didn&apos;t inherit her mother&apos;s steeliness. And Sigourney Weaver manages to convey a smug and patronising manner that is only hinted at in the script, but never quite overdoing it so it is still believable that Griffith initially warms to her. Harrison Ford is at his best too, moulding the role round his limited range by giving a business-world version of his usual level-headed action hero type.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of the look of this era, Working Girl will be a real treat for the eyes – everything from glorious cityscapes to pouffy dresses. I&apos;m glad director Mike Nichols puts such an emphasis on places and props, without loosing sight of the people of course. The changing fashions of the decade are even woven into the movie&apos;s themes, as Griffith swaps her hairsprayed bouffant and dangly bangles for an elegant, simple look. Working Girl is an incredibly 80s movie, but it&apos;s also the death of 80s extravagance we&apos;re witnessing there on screen. Of course, she still wears a pair of pink glasses with rims the size of beermats, but there you go. 80s extravagance died hard.",

      "name": "A colorful but simple version of Jesus Christ&apos;s life with an agreeable treatment",
      "reviewBody": "This highly regarded religious pic deals with the dramatic recreation of the life of Christ with an unknown cast , being spectacularly shot in 1975 and well directed by Roberto Rosselini . It chronicles the life and ministry of Jesus Christ from the Annunciation , Crucifixion , Death and Resurrection . Interesting retelling at the life and teachings of Christ (Pier Maria Rossi) from a historical and religious view point , though overlong . The film begins with the arrival of the Jews in the Promised Land and the appointment of their first king Saul (Vernon Dobtcheff) with descriptive Biblical passages ; his birth in Bethlehem and visit by three Magician Kings who , subsequently , go to the Palace of Herodes the Great (Vittorio Caprioli). His incident in which Jesus is lost in the temple as a boy, later on , in the desert tempted by Satan , knowing he has a destiny to fulfill ; his baptism by John the Baptist ; the miracles , such as : cripples walking , blind men seeing ; the fishes and the loaves ; Lazarus&apos; resurrection ; his relationship to 12 apostles and so on . Jesus Christ&apos;s journey from Galilee to Golgotha is portrayed here in thought-provoking as well as enjoyable treatment . And usual scenes between John the Baptist , Herod Antipas (Toni Ucci) , Herodias , and Salome and , of course , John the Baptist&apos;s beheading as Salome&apos;s price for dancing for Herod . In addition , Biblic roles as Mary Magdalene , Lazarus , Caiaphas (John Karlsen) , Peter, Mary of Bethan , Thaddeus , Simon the Zealot , John , Philip , the Adulteress (Tina Aumont) , Pontius Pilate (Jean Martin) and Barrabbas . And including holy sentences as &quot;My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken Me?&quot;.\n\nThis is a low-buget , impressive -though slow-moving- story of the life of Jesus Christ from his birth in Bethlehem to his Crucifixion and subsequent Resurrection . It is a religious and anguishing epic where the eternal questions of faith and doubt become resolved , being shot in Pasolini&apos;s Gospell according St. Matthew style . Life of Christ is intelligently written by prestigious screenwriter Silvia D&apos;Amico and Roberto Rosselini himself and source writings from Bible itself . Resulting to be completely reverential at some Biblical characters and passages from New Testament . Stars a serious and attractive Pier Maria Rossi in exactly the right role , he gives a dedicated effort at the character , his acting has power , nobility and subtlety . Being a limited budgeted production , here shows up mostly unknown players , however there are brief appearances from some Italian actors in brief performances as Vittorio Caprioli , Tina Aumont , John Karlsen , Jean Martin , Renato Escarpa ,and Vernon Dobtcheff as Samuel . Including glowing and evocative cinematography in charming visual style by Mario Montuori , shot on location in Morocco ; however , being necessary a perfect remastering . Sensitive and atmospheric soundtrack by the classical Mario Nascimbene. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Roberto Rosselini .\n\nJesus life has been adapted several times , such as : ¨King of Kings¨ (released in 1927) , it is the yardstick by which all Jesus movies are to be measure , being first silent version by Cecil B. DeMille with H. B. Wagner . Other pictures dealing with his divine presence are the following ones :¨King of Kings¨(1961) by Nicholas Ray with Jeffrey Hunter , Robert Ryan , Ron Randel , Hurd Hatfield , Rip Torn , Frank Thring , Carmen Sevilla ; ¨The greatest story ever told¨1965 by George Stevens with Max Von Sidow ,Gary Raymond) , David MacCallum , Roddy McDowall , Dorothy McGuire) , Telly Savalas , Charlton Heston , José Ferrer , Sidney Poitier , Claude Rains, Ina Balin ; ¨Gospel according to Matthew¨ by Pier Paolo Pasolini with Enrique Irazoqui as Jesus ; ¨Jesus Christ Superstar¨(1977) by Norman Jewison with Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson ; ¨Jesus de Nazareth¨(1977) by Franco Zeffirelli with Robert Powell , Olivia Hussey , James Mason , Laurence Olivier , Anne Brancfort , Fernando Rey ; ¨Last temptation of Christ¨ by Martin Scorsese with Willem Dafoe , David Bowie , Harvey Keitel , Ian Holm , Harry Dean Staton ; and ¨The Passion of the Christ¨ (2004) by Mel Gibson with James Cazievel , Maia Morgenstern and Monica Belucci .",

The inspector shyly courts the leading lady, there&apos;s a comic-relief assistant (dubbed by the same voice that does the similar character in the actual series), a few clever editing and camera tricks, and some Soho striptease scenes (possibly cut for the Medallion TV print). It has a creepy side, too, with the monstrous-looking heavy from Dark Eyes of London creeping around the caves under the mansion. Makes a nice midnight movie experience.",

The story has a Canadian mining engineer, Richard Hannay, unwillingly drawn into a spy chase when a woman unknown to him latches onto him as he&apos;s leaving a London theatre. She tells him she&apos;s a spy and that she needs his help. He&apos;s skeptical of her story, but he goes back to his London flat with her. Hannay is brilliantly played by actor Robert Donat. He turns out to be quite an interesting character, and a resourceful one at that. When the woman he returned home with turns up dead in his flat, Hannay flees London for Scotland, hoping to find a man he believes can clear him. The newspapers accuse Hannay of murder, so he knows he&apos;s a wanted man. During a chase through Scotland, Hannay finds he&apos;s not only pursued by the police for the murder he didn&apos;t commit, but by members of the spy ring the woman warned him about. Watch how he manages to deal with police, spies and a beautiful young woman played by Madeleine Carroll.",

      "reviewBody": "Very rarely do prequels match up with their predecessors. As I&apos;m not the biggest Underworld fan, I can honestly say that I wasn&apos;t expecting much. However, I should&apos;ve expected more, as the latest, yet earliest installment is easily my favorite in the series. It ain&apos;t art, but it&apos;s the shining example of why we go to the movies: to escape into a world of mythology, fantasy, and crazy vampire/werewolf action.\n\nFor the first time in the series, the filmmakers have decided to leave out the rock that probably was the reason the films have been successful: Kate Beckinsale. I&apos;m guessing this was a production risk/choice, but it seems to have paid off. Selene&apos;s absence from the story is necessary to tell the story of how the Lycans rose to power, how Viktor was driven insane (though we pretty much already know how), and, as off topic as it may be, how simply awesome Michael Sheen is.\n\nVery rarely do the actors make an action movie good. Most action movies rely on explosions and (surprise!) action to enhance the quality and generally feature run of the mill copycat characters. Sheen&apos;s Lucian and Bill Nighy&apos;s Viktor will always stand out in the realm of action/fantasy characters to me, and it&apos;s easy to see why. Sheen&apos;s turn as Lucian is fierce, determined, and one of my favorite performances in an action movie I&apos;ve seen in years. Despite playing a (mostly) villainous role in the first film, Lucian is the hero of this film, and it totally gives you a new spin on things. Sheen&apos;s brave and dedicated performance really makes the character work, while Bill Nighy is once again effectively creepy as Viktor. Rhona Mitra&apos;s presence as Sonja is welcome, though she doesn&apos;t carry the same charisma that Beckinsale does, making her an ill advised choice to be Selene&apos;s replacement (as she so obviously is).\n\nThe action in Underworld, though obviously restrained by a lower budget, is once again great. There&apos;s some nice dueling, the obvious gore and blood galore, and a nice Lord of the Rings style battle at the end. What it comes down to is that Underworld does nothing new, but does everything right in maintaining a steady river of entertainment. I was never bored, and I don&apos;t think you will be either.\n\nThe film does answer a lot of questions and provides some nice insight to the Lycans (which were my favorite parts about the first two films), though it suffers from the same fate as most prequels do...even a casual viewer of this series knows which characters will live, which will die, and how it will end. The film isn&apos;t really about the resolution, but rather the journey to the end. In fact, it&apos;s made in such a way that you can certainly watch the trilogy in chronological order.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I liked &apos;Lycans&apos; a lot. It&apos;s a worthy installment in the series, and certainly not a disappointment to me. It&apos;s got good action, a wonderful lead performance from Michael Sheen, and should satisfy fans of the series and fans of mythological stories altogether.",

      "reviewBody": "Like many a horror film, this starts off with a varied bunch of people seeking shelter once they discover that a bridge they need to cross has collapsed, and they end up at a spooky mansion (looks like a cheap model!) run by a guy who kind of looks like that guy out of No Country For Old Men.\n\nOur victims this time include uptight Giacomo Rossi-Stuart who hates his boozy, floozy wife (and she hates him back!), two cops who have just arrested murderer Spike, a doctor, his assistant and a local who provides the creepy exposition. Every single one of them smoke like troopers, including the doctor. The caretaker tells them it&apos;s probably not a good idea to stay the night but then doesn&apos;t seem to bothered as he has a naked chick in his room.\n\nAfter her suggestion of an orgy is turned down, Giacomo&apos;s wife then finds out that the house was owned by a lady who was accused of killing her husband, and also accused of being a witch. The wife thinks this is a good time to do a séance and that&apos;s where the film starts getting interesting as all of a sudden Giacomo becomes possessed and starts talking in the dead ladies voice. Seems that the night isn&apos;t going to be as boring as they thought In amongst all the Gialli and Spaghetti Westerns I&apos;m watching it&apos;s nice to watch a straightforward horror film, even if it is a bit patchy and slow. There&apos;s a nice atmosphere to this one, and although it&apos;s not great all the way through, there are some sequences that stand out, like when Giacomo&apos;s wife has a strange hallucination that she&apos;s stabbing Farley Granger over and over again while he laughs in her face, or the constant ticking of clocks throughout the house which makes me wonder if Lucio Fulci had this film in mind when making The House of Clocks years later.\n\nThere also a guy getting attacked by a picture and some disembodied laughing, plus the end sequence is carried out quite well. You can add this one to pile of horror the Italian made set giant houses. Or do something worthwhile instead.",

In it, he actually wrestles with the character he plays, and comes up with a dramatic performance that, while no Brando, is still quite believable.\n\nThis is a very violent film. It is also a very troubling film. William Forsythe - who also turns in a better than average performance - plays a lower-rung mob boss who, strung out on crack and finding his girl-friend cheating on him, turns psychotic and suicidal. Not a good mix - he starts blowing people away just because they irritate him a little.\n\nThe film is also an attempt to deal with the continuing fragmentation of neighborhood communities that were once the heart and soul of larger cities. The community is preserved, but only tentatively - the seeds of its eventual collapse have clearly been planted. The extreme violence of the film thus becomes the manifestation of a unresolvable frustration with the tensions of a community falling apart.\n\nAll this adds up to a surprisingly complex Steven Seagal action film that will haunt you long after the closing credits.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, if Joan Crawford didn&apos;t know the end was near for her at MGM, she knew it when she was handed &quot;Above Suspicion,&quot; based on the novel of the same name by Helen MacInnes. I read the novel years ago and confess I don&apos;t remember much of it.\n\nThe year is 1939, before war breaks out. Crawford plays a newlywed, and Fred MacMurray her American husband, who teaches at Oxford. The couple are asked by the foreign office to track down someone while honeymooning in Germany, a man who can help the Allies regarding a German secret weapon. This weapon is a magnetic water bomb that is pulled to a ship and explodes. At first, it&apos;s fun; then it becomes dangerous.\n\nThis is an entertaining film in part thanks to a good cast of Crawford, MacMurray, Basil Rathbone, and Conrad Veidt. There are some suspenseful sequences. There is also some real stuff of spy books and films - special hats, song codes, codes on maps and in books.\n\n&quot;Above Suspicion&quot; doesn&apos;t seem very big budget and despite some Bavarian costumes and quaint German towns, it&apos;s all Hollywood set. Given the huge films Crawford took part in at MGM, this black and white movie must have seemed like a come-down. It was. Louis B didn&apos;t want over the hill actresses - i.e., those over 30. There&apos;s nothing special about her part, which could have been done by any MGM stock player. And at 38, for those days, she was a little old to be a bride. Better things were on the horizon for Crawford, though she couldn&apos;t have known it at the time.\n\nWorth seeing.",

The location is real and so are the fighting. It belongs to the classic that we miss in today&apos;s Kung Fu movies. If you practice Kung Fu, you have to watch it repeatedly to learn a lot from the real masters. It is quite good for the first Kung Fu movie made in China (about 20 years ago)."

For Fellini, is the first film he directs, together with Alberto Lattuada. The beautiful Carla Del Poggio, Lattuada&apos;s wife in real life, stands in the role Liliana &apos;Lily&apos; Antonelli. All the actors, although not big names of the Italian cinema, are very talented. The music is not signed yet by Nino Rota, but by Felice Lattuada. A very good film, to be seen at any time, again and again. Watch for a very young Vittorio Caprioli in the role of The Night Club Comic."

The lead truck, called &quot;Monster&quot; has been created by a boy genius and is to be driven by a woman through the course. The only problem is the computer guidance system fails and she ends up in uncharted territories. There she encounters leather-clad hoods who torture her and eventually kill her. Before dying she tells a fellow prisoner about the truck and he uses it to escape. Most of the rest of the film is his relationship (&quot;2001&quot; - Hal-like) with the truck&apos;s computer and his avoidance of attacking vehicles. Meanwhile back at the Terminus, the boy genius is ruled by a mysterious doctor, who may have another plan in mind.",

She was not thrilled when I told her we were going to see a film that told a story from the civil rights era but when we left she said she loved it because of the women&apos;s courage, their humor and the power of their friendships. We had never seen most of the actors which was refreshing and the acting by the entire cast made it easy to get totally involved. I laughed out loud and shed quite a few tears in The Help, and will remember it and recommend it to my friends. It was wonderful to see so many scenes in which the actors related to each other so perfectly. Even the vilest characters showed moments of conflict within themselves as they played out poor behavior that had long been inbred in them. I am especially grateful to the team who provided a film that told an engaging story about human relationships with important lessons for my daughter. That is a rare occurrence in today&apos;s movies."

      "reviewBody": "Apart from perhaps being a satire of gangster movies, the point of this film eludes me. Two guys and a young woman plan a robbery at the Paris house where the young woman lives with her aunt. The young woman is naive and constantly scared. The two young men are seemingly rather ordinary. I didn&apos;t find any of these people interesting. We never learn much about them or what motivates them. Yet, given that this is a &quot;New Wave&quot; film I doubt that characterization was all that important to the film&apos;s director.\n\nThe plot starts out okay, but then meanders, and then becomes increasingly silly and unbelievable. Maybe that was intentional. Midway through, the three main characters suddenly, and for no reason, burst into a dance called the &quot;Madison&quot;, the steps to which are nothing if not annoyingly repetitive. This bouncy little interlude goes on for some time, yet it has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Again, maybe that&apos;s the point.\n\nOther gimmicks are inserted gratuitously, evidently to shock 1964 viewers into the realization, consistent with New Wave doctrine, that the film is not a product of the dreaded classical Hollywood narrative style of film-making.\n\nBut the worst element of this film is the sound. Background, ambient noise is amplified; why, I don&apos;t know, except, again, as some counterpoint to standard Hollywood films. Yet, the noise in &quot;Band Of Outsiders&quot; is so distracting, even grating, it takes away from what little value the visuals and narrative may have.\n\nB&amp;W cinematography is unremarkable. Lighting is low-contrast. Visuals trend toward grayish, pallid tones. Production design, in keeping with low-budget film-making, is plain, even cheap looking.\n\nAs a daring and iconoclastic attempt in 1964 to provide an alternative to stodgy, old-style Hollywood film-making, Godard&apos;s &quot;Band Of Outsiders&quot; probably does have some historical value. But what was visionary then seems campy and trite now."

Sadly, &apos;Amelia&apos; doesn&apos;t live up to being close to those expectations. Nair captures the era very well, through the costumes, set design and music. The visuals, especially the sceneries are stunning. However, the story at times feels contrived and at times more like a documented account of Earhart&apos;s life rather than a movie. The pacing is quite slow. However, unlike many others, I didn&apos;t find it this one to be a snoozefest but that may be because of my previous knowledge of Amelia Earhart and because of a particular performance which I&apos;ll come back to a little later on. It&apos;s quite disappointing that Nair didn&apos;t demonstrate much back story on Amelia, like how did she make it this far in what was then considered a man&apos;s world and how she developed her passion for flying. Despite its flaws, the last fifteen to twenty minutes were well-executed. Here, Nair very subtly builds tension and while the viewer knows what it going to happen, they are in suspense as they anticipate Amelia and her passenger&apos;s fate. Richard Gere is quite adequate as Putnam. Ewan McGregor is marginally better. But, it is Hilary Swank who steals the show. She is the force that drives this movie with a nuanced performance. I wonder why she didn&apos;t receive much recognition for this portrayal. Needless to say, Swank owns the movie."

      "reviewBody": "Claude Aurent-Lara was one of the best directors France ever produced. A good director takes a similar harmless story and elevates to high art. A bad one cannot. It is in the way he frames a shot, builds the tension and especially the transition shots that define one. In that case, Aurent-Lara ranks up there with the likes of Eisenstein and Hitchcock. The man was an ultimate craftsman who understood cinema. Shame on Truffaut who just showed his ignorance for slamming him and his movies. This movie also known as four full bags teams two of France&apos;s biggest stars of the era, Jean Gabin and the one name Bourvil in a delicious comedy with a human heart. It is WWII and occupied France is running short of pigs thus creating a black market for it. Bourvil&apos;s job is to get the already killed pig&apos;s carcass aka pork in four cases and deliver it to the seller who will take it to the market. He meets and enlists the &quot;homeless&quot; Gabin to assist. They must outwit scared Parisiens and Nazis on the night watch to achieve this deceitfully simple task. That is all you need to know to enjoy this war time romp. The laughs come at a clip a minute, mainly from the garrulous and belligerent Gabin with Bourvil, the straight man in their Lawrence and hardy relationship. Before the night is over and daylight comes, we shall meet dogs, drunks, experience the fear of an occupied people who hope for a better tomorrow all done with a airy touch. And the last scene will make any cinema lover and human being rejoice. I love this movie so much, I think though it is not as complex as Kubrick&apos;s Dr. Strangelove shares its agony and eccentricity of the nature of war.",

The tramp is portrayed by no other than Allan Edwall (Mattias from &apos;Bröderna Lejonhjärta&apos;). Rasmus is portrayed by Erik Lindgren.\n\nIt&apos;s not a bad movie, but it&apos;s pretty average. I personally find it nothing special. Realistically it isn&apos;t much more than a not completely successful musical with a somehow dull plot. Even the beauty of the colored Swedish cinematography isn&apos;t enough to save it.\n\nAlthough the Swedish film industry seems to be too small to have much reviews and people who know it, I&apos;m still surprised that I&apos;m the first person to review this film. There must have at least a few people who know it, even if those people are all Swedish and if the number of them can be counted by the fingers.",

On the other hand, who let him do that and why is still debated in Italy and abroad, subject to political interpretation and therefore a quite tedious and convoluted story to tell. The audience here gets to experience the Italian TV and media dominated reality from a purely naturalistic angle, almost like an ethologist would look at a society of ants. The movie, I believe, is a lot more powerful and compelling that way: the viewers can go through all the the feelings of incredulity, anguish, disgust, pity and anger it generates without anyone saying out loud that they should, making those feelings all the more intense and true.",

The camerawork is pretty good with the colorful lightening, settings, designs and special effects helping to add the futuristic setting and environment. With an solid soundtrack and direction as well.\n\nThe narrative is interesting and does provide some strong elements about human evolution and technology together. However, some of the narrative themes does feel a little preachy and inconsistent regarding it&apos;s message and social commentaries that is is trying to explore. The performances from Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor are pretty great and the two of them have surprisingly pretty good chemistry between on another.\n\nOne of the weaker elements are the characters as the characters aren&apos;t as fully interesting or engaging to connect with as much. There are some decent dialogue moment as well. Some of the pacing could have been improved.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s decent.",

      "reviewBody": "Overall production value is not very high on this film; I seem to recall the film&apos;s inability to pass off studio sets as exterior locations. My recollection is of a very &quot;TV-like&quot; production on the level of a &quot;B&quot; movie with a large then usual budget. However, Jack Palance is excellent as Attila the Hun. He really does come across as a barbarian, giving a very intense performance that compares well with his earlier role as Toriano in &quot;Arrowhead&quot; with Charlton Heston. Some great supporting roles, also, with Jeff Morrow (This Island Earth) playing the grizzled Roman General, and Alexander Scourby (famous for his narration/voiceover work) playing Chrysaphius the Eunuch, advisor to Theodosius II. Jeff Chandler&apos;s subdued performance is a good match for the stoic Christian Roman he plays. It&apos;s a good counterpoint to Palance&apos;s growling Attila. For years, I thought Palance was short of stature, based on his sword fighting here with Jeff Chandler, but it was just that Chandler was several inches taller than Palance who was himself 6&apos; 2&quot;...\n\nInteresting trivia:\n\nThe uncredited narrator of the film is Rex Reason who co-starred with Jeff Morrow in &quot;This Island Earth.&quot;",

Singer turned actor Freddy offers some of his pop songs, while on a fantastic voyage to retrieve some money he foolishly loaned to an obnoxious millionaire (played by Comedic national treasure Heinz Erhardt). The supporting cast includes some popular film/TV stars of the day, but the final product just doesn&apos;t rise above formula rom-com fluff.\n\nErhardt delivers plenty of his signature witty one-liners, which work much better on stage in front of a live audience. Freddy (and others) constantly breaking into song is unmotivated and adds little to the thin story. To see many popular celebrities in their youth, by all means, sit through the lame parade of shenanigans, but for if you want quality entertainment, skip this turkey!",

They have made a robbery by stealing from Orsay museum the renown Manet painting &quot;Topless girl&quot;, in order to pay the debts of the barge which was always, the proper home for them and their family - two by now, as their mother died and their father is ill in the hospital. Now are three, as they have with them the guard of the museum - the beautiful and fearless also sexy, Rosalie who kidnapped her in their boat, as she was running after them. All three are trying to find a buyer for the renown, valuable painting - all these, among beautiful images of the still river waters, full of pending trees, as their barge is crossing them. The two brothers are impressed by the girl and she finally involves herself in an affair with the elder. A nice cinematography showing another life - that of people working by and crossing the river with on that purpose river-ships. Also a mention to the wild life by the sides of the river as it has been painted by Renoir and other impressionists. The Polish mafia following them to get the painting, but also the lonely life of desperate young people who had no affection in their lives. The scenery of both banks of la Seine is fantastic - also the description of the life on board of the barge. The acting of the three protagonists is very persuasive, real and human as well. Their emotions as wild they appear, always turn sweet - first mentioning the younger little brother, as he is a tender, affectionate, fearless companion - caring as well, brother.",

It was an interesting enough premise.\n\nAlberta (Leelee Sobieski) seems to do nothing but get herself involved with trouble. Fleeing one such scenario, she stows on a bus to Vancouver, to stay with her former babysitter (Tricia Helfer). Turns out her &quot;aunt&quot; Celene is now paying her bills as a dominatrix. Alberta is curious, and can&apos;t help but get involved, posing as Celene. This gets Leelee into some incredibly hot outfits (as well as more trouble). I suppose that was the main appeal for me in Walk All Over Me. Actually, I did enjoy it when Celene beats up the French-Canadian guy (or whatever the hell that accent was supposed to be. His name was Rene Leblanc, or something like that, so I&apos;m making some assumptions). Am I sensing a theme? Celene, Rene, Alberta, in a Canadian production?\n\nI&apos;m surprised by the number of people who consider Leelee a bad actress. I&apos;ve watched 3 of her movies in the last 2 nights, and she plays completely different characters in all of them. And I&apos;m the first to point out a bad performance. Here, she plays a naive, meek young woman who gets to taste a little empowerment. She was quite good.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure, Meet the Feebles may not be director Peter Jackson (yes, Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings and King Kong) at his finest hour of directorial standing, but as a fan of a certain kind of really deranged and off-kilter cult movie, a lot of this made my night. It&apos;s an ultra-perverse, ultra-absurd, and sometimes really ultra-stupid take on a variety show where puppets are preparing for the night&apos;s performance, only everything that could go wrong- or more precisely anything that could be unexpected to go wrong- does every which way to Sunday. It&apos;s actually the kind of movie when I was watching, for the most part early on, I almost couldn&apos;t really laugh. I just had a look on my face like &apos;what am I watching?&apos; And, &apos;how can something like this actually exist?&apos; It&apos;s not even so much a question of how well or how not well Jackson and his low-budget team pull it off, but how someone can take the time and energy to think this all up and put it all on paper.\n\nLet me try to sort through some of the varied story lines- there is Robert, a newcomer to the Feebles gang (and gang I mean in literal and figurative terms), who wants to impress a certain poodle-dog type of girl who really has him going to lengths to impress her. But meanwhile, a really nasty rodent- also a porno director as well as the boss&apos;s assistant- decides to use her in his next porno flick by drugging her. This rodent also has to deal with some other low-lifes in the group, like a junkie lizard who has one big story to tell Robert at one point about his crazy, violent trip to Vietnam (including a &apos;why not&apos; homage to Deer Hunter). There&apos;s also a rabbit who may or may not be dying from an STD of some sort (I think it was an STD anyway), and has a pestering fly (always in the most uncomfortably close of close-ups) trying to get the scoop on his condition. There&apos;s even the overly-annoying stage manager who can&apos;t wait to put on his God-awful dance number of his own. But the main center of attention and star of the Feebles shows is Heidi, a hippo who loves to binge on junk food, and is also suspecting a femme-feline of stealing away her previous man- the boss. When she finds out what&apos;s really up, it leads to the unbelievable climax.\n\nAnd so on. I still keep thinking about my reactions to certain scenes, and the kind of sensibility about this whole project. Maybe in part its really lampooning something maybe more common in New Zealand, like with whatever kinds of variety shows or kid shows they have there. But it&apos;s also without a doubt that Jackson&apos;s also seen his share of Muppets, as the basic concept follows off from the Muppet Show. What&apos;s amazing about the film, and at times a little frustrating, is how a real mind-set of gonzo film-making is apparent. It doesn&apos;t seem original in parts, like it&apos;s taking things from other movies- or maybe other movies and shows that have come after this seem quite similar- but it really is in the bizarre, crude nature of everything. The climax probably holds the biggest laughs and surprises, even in its tight context of everything going to hell in a hand-basket. As its a world entire devoid of humans, all of its logic is based around how outrageous these puppets can be in their own whacked-out environment. With the exception of the naive, method-trained Robert, and maybe his love interest, every character in the picture is severely flawed in one way or another, or just really put to abstract lengths so mind-boggling they work only in conjunction with Jackson&apos;s unnerving, low-budget style. It has the same jarring, diabolically juvenile and in-your-face comedy of some of the South Park guys stuff (Team America and Cannibal sort of come to mind), but without necessarily the sharp edge of satire.\n\nAnd at the end of it all, with all the laughs I had and shocked &apos;huh&apos; moments at what Jackson had done with all these weird characters (some of which are outright perverts, drug addicts, criminals, egoists, adulterers, and even father half elephant-half chicken offspring), I wasn&apos;t sure totally what the point of it all was. Maybe though there really isn&apos;t any; I have to think this is the kind of movie that a director makes with himself as the audience, and not really in a selfish manner either. It&apos;s not great art by any means, and doesn&apos;t pretend to be, which is part of the dark fun of it all: Meet the Feebles, with its singing and dancing miscreants (quite a catchy theme song by the way), and numerous scenes of more-than-suggestive sexual moments and gory bouts of extreme violence, is a case of kamikaze independent film-making, where homage spreads out into the concept and becomes something very strange but, in its own world, sort of wonderful too. It might be far from my favorite of the director&apos;s, but it&apos;s got things in it that are really fantastic and uproarious. It&apos;s one of those fine guilty pleasures of the late 80s.",

      "reviewBody": "Just watched this movie for about the 20th time (I have it on TiVo) and for the life of me I cannot find the disdain many who have written here have commented on. Last I heard, this was FICTION - NOT a documentary; Ken Burns did not produce not write nor direct nor narrate this piece - Roland Emmerich, a man known for action FICTION did. Yes the depiction of the Revolutionary War was NOT 100% accurate but was never intended to be; just a drama set against the background of a war and it was refreshing to see the war in the background, whereupon American blood is spilled on American soil, was the Revolutionary War and not another Civil War piece; indeed, the Civil War has been played so many times in films over the past quarter century it was just refreshing to see a different war....\n\nBeing somewhat of a military historian I will say that the depiction of soldiers going musket to musket in the open field was indeed accurate; many may find it interesting to know that according to the gentlemanly practices of King George&apos;s army, both sides would also recess for tea at noon every day and resume the fighting afterwards - guerrilla warfare was not popular during the day which is why Gibson&apos;s militia unit was so overtly successful early on. That being said, the comments about the accuracy with the muskets are fairly accurate but I will say that I only see straight barrel musket rifles - none of the bell shape tipped muskets; the longer you keep a projectile on a straight course the more accuracy at longer ranges despite the lack of rifling grooves in the barrels (I spent time on Rifle Teams for 5 years). The prime inaccuracy I noted was when Tavington shot the rider (running away on horseback) in the back with a musket pistol at probably 40 yards or more - so unlikely, it tarnished the whole scene.\n\nMy favorite person - Billings; Leon Rippey&apos;s cynical, almost giggly snickering laugh completely stole the every scene where it was used and he is a long term favorite actor of mine; Jason Isaacs absolutely best screen villain of this movie (and perhaps in top 10 screen villains of all time).\n\nI guess it boils down to &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot; we all have our opinions on this and I&apos;ve aired mine.",

Avoid at all costs.\n\nI have to add ten lines of text, so I&apos;ll say that producer Bernd Eichinger and director Uli Edel probably wanted to print money quickly on the relative popularity of vulgar talk singer Anis Ferchichi, aka &quot;Bushido&quot;. However, &quot;Bushido&apos;s&quot; star seems to be sinking, maybe because it&apos;s hard to keep streetcred with mostly immigrant youth when the cultural and political elite is kissing your behind. And the ruling party, the &quot;Christian-Democratic-Union&quot; invites you to join its ranks. Add to that 13 cases of proved (and costly) plagiarism and maybe the film came out a few moths late for making money. Despite its seeming to have been hastily produced. Meh, this time stealer will soon be forgotten like its subject.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; is one of those &quot;feel-good&quot;, &quot;inspirational&quot; films which is actually feel-good and inspirational but in a very generic kind-of-way.\n\nBrendan Fraser awkwardly stars as a businessman who desperately hopes that &quot;they&quot; will find a cure for Pompe disease, which two of his children are dying from. As you would expect, he stays up late researching trying to find the latest advances. This teams him up with Harrison Ford, an unpersonable scientist, who also provides the few comic relief moments.\n\nBased on a true story, but in such a way that although the overall story may come from real life, all the events shown are surely fictional. It&apos;s dramatic when we need it to be and things work out when we need them to - way too formulaic and tidy for real life. They tell us some of the science behind the cure, which is of course nonsense, but it&apos;s supposed to get the audience more invested in what&apos;s happening; however, it&apos;s just a reminder that this is Hollywood not real life.\n\nLet me go back to the beginning, &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; is feel-good and inspirational, and if you like those types of movies, this one plays out exactly as it&apos;s supposed to. You&apos;ll get swept up into the story and cry when you&apos;re supposed to. Everything is right on cue.",

      "reviewBody": "Syriana is a confused, ambitious and complex thriller of corruption and power related to the oil industry that tells four parallel stories: the CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) with great experience in Middle East that falls in disgrace after an unsuccessful mission dealing missiles in Lebanese Republic; the investigation of the attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) related to the merge of two American oil companies, Connex and Killen; the traumatic association of the energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) with the son of a powerful emir of Iran; and the social drama of the Pakistani immigrant worker Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) that is fired by the oil company.\n\nThe greatest problem with this movie is that it is too complex for only 126 minutes running time, due to the number of plots, subplots and characters; therefore its edition is tremendously confused with the use of many ellipsis. It would be more appropriated a mini-series, or a longer film. Even the title of this movie is very ambiguous, with many non-official explanations. The movie&apos;s website states that &quot;&apos;Syriana&apos; is a very real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East.&quot; (http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/about.html). In the end, I truly found this movie a pretentious and sophisticated collection of clichés sold in a beautiful &quot;package&quot;. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Syriana  A Indústria do Petróleo&quot; (&quot;Syriana  The Oil Industry&quot;)",

I haven&apos;t seen a film with such an accurate and heart wrenching portraits of troubled youths since &quot;Kids&quot;.\n\n&quot;A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints&quot; gives us a glimpse into the life of Dito Montiel (Shia Labouf, with Robert Downey Jr. as the older version) growing up on the streets of Astoria, Queens in 1986. When he leaves for California, he leaves behind his best friend and resident tough guy Antonio (Channing Tatum, with Eric Roberts playing the older version), his caring mother (Diane Wiest) and tough love father (Chazz Palminteri), his girlfriend Laurie (Melonie Diaz, with Rosario Dawson as the older version), and pretty much everyone else he knew.\n\nFirst time director Dito Montiel does a stellar job of establishing characters and their relationships. He also does a great job directing scenes that seem so real (thnks to some superb acting by the cast), it almost seems like a documentary. A huge round of applause goes to the cast for their performances.\n\nThe ending wasn&apos;t really cohesive with the script. I didn&apos;t leave knowing what happened with Dito and his family and friends. Other than that, there&apos;s not a single bad moment.\n\n&quot;A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints&quot; is raw, gritty, and stunning. There&apos;s not a single disappointing scene in the movie.\n\n9.5/10",

Even the snakes at the final have twins (hahaha! I don&apos;t know if this is a reference to &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; But if it isn&apos;t than it should be,because that would be funny and smart) ! Other than it is fun to watch twins in action i can&apos;t see the point of using these twins! Normally twins cause confusion when they switch identities! Only at one occasion a mistake like this is made! This is a missed opportunity! It could have been more exciting! The movie is filled with stunts and martial arts! There is a lot of humor and even a touch of drama! But the real treat is actor Wu Jing (Fatal Contact,Tai Chi Boxer)! He really is in excellent form! If it wasn&apos;t for him this movie would be below average! He and his skills lift this movie to a higher level! Sammo Hung also stars in &quot;Twins Mission&quot; but doesn&apos;t has a big role! It is too bad they didn&apos;t let him do much more! &quot;Twins Mission&quot; is not bad! Thanks to Wu Jing!",

But I have a basic understanding of Margaret Mead and the importance she had in 20th century anthropology.\n\nIn the 20th century, native cultures were dying out. Fewer and fewer places were not part of the &quot;modern world&quot;. Today (2016) this is even more true, and I wonder if any place on earth is still truly native. But anyway, Mead was able to record these cultures and we are fortunate that in this case the people of Bali were captured on film. I suspect the dances and rituals shown in this film are already, 50 years later, no longer practiced.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the great undiscovered gems of recent movie history.  In my opinion, Miller&apos;s crossing is easily the best of the Coen brothers&apos; films, and one of the true classics of American cinema.\n\nOn the surface, the story of warring gangsters in 1920&apos;s America is one that has been told many times before.  But never before has it been handled with such artistry and precision.  The (rather violent) action scenes keep the movie going along at a brisk pace, and the camera work is every bit the equal of &quot;Fargo&quot;.\n\nI became a lifelong Gabriel Byrne fan as a result of this movie, despite his best efforts to disappoint me since.  Byrne&apos;s Tom Reagan is a compellingly amoral character, who takes more unchallenged beatings than perhaps anyone in film history.  Men beat him up.  Women beat him up.  Collection men, bookies, gangsters, and even his boss gives him a terrible thrashing, and he hardly lifts a finger in opposition (with one notably humorous exception).\n\nAlbert Finney is tremendous as Leo, the local crime boss.  His &quot;Danny Boy&quot; scene should go down in film history as one of the greatest pieces ever filmed.  Jon Polito is at once absurdly funny and threateningly psychotic as Johnny Caspar, Leo&apos;s rival in the turf war.  J.E. Freeman, John Turturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all lend strong support in a cast that was assembled and performs to near perfection.\n\nI will never understand why this film has not received more recognition and acclaim.  As an example of the modern style of Film Noir, it has no equals (&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; would rate a close second).  Among gangster films, only &quot;The Godfather&quot; can compete, and &quot;Miller&apos;s Crossing&quot; features superior pacing and dialog, although it lacks &quot;The Godfather&apos;s&quot; epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive, like &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, the belated accolades it so richly deserves.",

      "reviewBody": "With its leather-gloved killer, amazing score, spectacular and innovative camera-work, and wonderfully gory murders, Tenebre delivers everything you could ask for in a giallo. Like many Italian murder mysteries, the story takes some swallowing, but if you can accept the convoluted plot, there&apos;s plenty of fun to be had.\n\nPeter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) is a best-selling novelist who becomes involved in real life murder mystery when the victims of a razor-wielding killer are found with pages from his latest book stuffed in their mouths.\n\nOne of director Dario Argento&apos;s best movies, Tenebre is packed to the rafters with the kind of stuff that make good giallos such a trip to watch. As pretty girls are stalked and killed by a raspy-voiced maniac, the director offers genuine clues and red herrings aplenty, allowing the audience to have fun trying to figure out who the killer is. The movie&apos;s stunning cinematography is accompanied by one of Goblin&apos;s greatest scores, transforming what may have been mundane moments in the hands of a lesser director into pure works of art (in one amazing scene the camera simply prowls slowly around the outside of a building, but with Argento in control, it is simply breathtaking!).\n\nMurder has never been so stylish, and even the most grisly deaths are stunningly captured. A particularly memorable moment has a young girl stumble into the house of the killer, before being chased through a garden; this scene is shot from the axe-wielding maniac&apos;s point of view, and is incredibly effective.\n\nFans of gore are also catered for with several gruesome murders, the best of which involves bucket-loads of arterial spray decorating most of a wall. Juicy!\n\nArgento reveals the identity of the killer in a suitably silly finale (all gialli have them), before offing the murderer in a fittingly gruesome manner.\n\nCheck out Tenebre and witness one of the great works from one of Italian horror&apos;s finest.",

Scene&apos;s often contain only one or two shots, cutting right when everything has been said. Its one of the few films where I did not notice the camera (I&apos;m a student cameraman), which should be the goal of every cameraman, at least in this style of film. The acting is very impressive (especially Jeremie Renier as Bruno), like previous Dardenne Films. The film seems the most accessible Dardenne so far, although it does not bore in simplicity (I saw it twice in one week, avant-premiere and sneak preview, and I liked the second time best).",

Some standout performances, including an unforgettable rendition of Sweet Georgia Brown by Anita O&apos;Day and a gorgeous set by a beatific Mahalia Jackson would make this film worth watching all on their own. But, there&apos;s more. A very young Chuck Berry makes an appearance, and the earliest Rock and Roll seems boring by comparison to the many styles of jazz displayed in this film. Despite the repetitive groove, the folks in the audience can&apos;t help moving their feet to it and the future is foretold. Bert Stern deliberately moves the focus away from Berry&apos;s stage pyrotechnics and keeps it on the audience and the amused if bored jazz musicians. Did he know this was what the future held? Maybe. Bits and pieces of the lives of affluent Newport residents, a yacht race (America&apos;s Cup qualifying), jazz musicians practicing, a break into Bach by a cellist, dancing on the rooftops, all the small parts that make this film greater than their sum, this is one worth watching, and perhaps, like me, you&apos;ll find it one worth adding to your permanent library of musical film.",

French cinema was liberated long before the sixties and did not suffer the same sort of censorship as American. I don&apos;t know if American cinema of the fifties has to offer anything similar to Monsieur Ripois. Here is this perfectly charming man who is also a parasite that you cannot help but like because he is also childish. Rarely does a film show a narcissist as someone to feel pity for. This one offers, in my opinion, an accurate aspect of the disorder. He is his own worst enemy. But it&apos;s really the acting that makes this character so convincing. Learning French with Gerard Philipe in this film is one of the funniest movie scenes I&apos;ve seen. The women he meets are all better than him, yet they all fall for him. He truly falls for one of them. Quite literally. A very refreshing take on the battle of the sexes free of today&apos;s mores. Looks like women were able to take care of themselves over the past century. It&apos;s not the New Wave.",

In Brazil, it remained unreleased on video until a couple of months ago, when fortunately it was &apos;rescued&apos; and released on DVD by the Brazilian distributor &apos;Versátil&apos;, specialized in masterpieces such as Fellini, Rosselini and Visconti. Now I have just had the chance to watch again this weird and daring movie about the decay of the society of consumption, empty and compulsive, searching for &quot;sex and food&quot; (material goods) much more than they need. The main characters use their Christian names. This movie is also a great black humor comedy. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Comilança&quot; (&quot;The Binge&quot;)",

The course of the film chronicles his journey through the war.\n\nI picked this DVD up pretty much blind in New York&apos;s Chinatown. The only thing I could read on the package was that it came subtitled in English. The picture on the box was of our hero trying to kill himself with a rifle. Other than that I knew nothing about the film when I started it.\n\nNeither a good film nor a bad film this was more or less a standard, though over long, war film from a different point of view, namely the North Korean. Not a propaganda piece, the film simply shows war from what many would consider the other side of the line. Large scale to be sure the film is much too polished and perfect in a completely artificial way, no ones clothes are really ragged, there is no dirt and some of the battle scenes have lines that are so neat and pretty even the most polished Hollywood film would blush. To me much of it comes off as silly TV movie.\n\nAllowing the film most of its flaws, the one that makes me not want to recommend the film is that its much too long. The film seems to keep going and going much like the Energized Bunny in TV commercials. I didn&apos;t really see the point after awhile, to be sure it covers most of the events of the war and gets the point of its despair across, but at the same time I don&apos;t think it needed to be over two and a half hours long.\n\nWar film fans or those interested in Korean cinema may want to give it a try, others may want to give it a pass.\n\n4 out of 10 (should be a 5 but its too long)",

But if that was true, you wouldn&apos;t watch the movie now would you? \n\nEffects are good and the direction is decent too.

      "reviewBody": "After a long absence from gangster films, Jimmy Cagney returned in WHITE HEAT. However, it&apos;s not just a typical gangster film as Cagney plays one of the craziest killers in film history--and the final product is incredibly entertaining.\n\nCagney plays a combination momma&apos;s boy and antisocial killing machine. What makes this more interesting is his unusually close relationship with his mother--who follows him as he goes on bank jobs around the country. While he has a girlfriend (Virginia Mayo), he&apos;s so attached to Mom that he cannot live without her. Heck, I almost expected to see him in bed with her--they were that close and it was very creepy. It was like Freud&apos;s idea of the Oedipal Complex except Cagney DID succeed in seducing and capturing his mother! Later in the film, Cagney&apos;s mother is killed--after which, Cagney becomes a lot more imbalanced. In addition to this, he has periodic blinding headaches and it&apos;s almost comical to see him writhing in pain one minute and blasting some guy for practically no reason the next! \n\nAfter this gang evades the police for some time, a special agent (Edmund O&apos;Brien) insinuates himself into the gang--becoming a trusted friend of Cagney in the process. Eventually, of course, the gang is captured and Cagney is confronted by a bazillion law enforcement officers in the most spectacular ending of any film noir picture in history. You just have to see it to believe it! \n\nOverall, a great script with lots of interesting psychological components. While Cagney&apos;s performance isn&apos;t the lest bit subtle, it certainly is very entertaining. For any lover of noir, this is a must-see and one of the most memorable films in movie history.",

This isn&apos;t a bad thing since that&apos;s what Christmas is about. However, when you get a film like this which is set in more realistic situations it&apos;s a nice break from the over cheeriness of the usual Chrimbo fodder.\n\nWhat also make this a movie worth watching is the acting, which, by and far, is superb. They actors did a great job and must have taken more than a few notes from the cameo &quot;Stars&quot; in the film, as this was the intended purpose of the Television Festival for Young People.\n\nThat said, the film could&apos;ve done with a bit better script and direction, there were times when my attention would stray, and the acting wasn&apos;t enough to keep me glued to the gogglebox.\n\nI recommend this film to all and we need more Christmas films like this - and more films helping young actors to come forward.",

      "reviewBody": "My review was written in May 1989 after a Cannes Film Festival Market screening.\n\nOn the heels of &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; comes &quot;Riverbend&quot;, an entertaining though outlandish fantasy about race relations set in Georgia in 1966. Pic has a chance of breaking through from its target black audience to wider acceptance.\n\nProducer Sam Vance&apos;s quirky screenplay relies on a deus ex machina that is akin to time travel, Into the sleepy town of Riverbend, Georgia, is injected a set of three black soldiers, headed by Steve James, who have escaped from military police while headed towards a court martial for failing to follow orders in Vietnam.\n\nThe black townsfolk are being persecuted (and murdered at will) by the evil white sheriff (Tony Frank). James hits upon the scheme of using his military expertise to train the locals (&quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; style) to take over the town, imprison the white folks and thereby focus statewide media attention on the hotspot in order to air his beef with the army.\n\nAlmost overwhelmed by too many twists and climaxes in the later reels, &quot;Riverbend&quot; works due to the inherently interesting switcheroo of its wish-fulfillment premise and James&apos; solid central performance. Muscular thesp has apperare as sidekick in several Cannon features made by helmer Sam Firstenberg, but gets the opportunity here to dominate the proceedings. His low-key, authoritative delivery, very modern styling and martial arts abilities give the 1966 tale a 1989 perspective.\n\nAlmost stealing the show is arch-villain Tony Frank, whose rubbery face and ample girth launch a definitive portrayal of the hissable Southern sheriff.\n\nMargaret Avery provides the film&apos;s emotional center as a widow who befriends James. Julius Tennon scores as James&apos; mutinous aide who almost diverts the good guys into an understandable revenge mode.\n\nTexas-lensed production is modestly mounted but includes some effective imagery, notably the final confrontation when black and white throngs stream into the town square, separated at first by an invisible (but palpable) barrier before becoming reconciled."

Of course our main woman character is also blonde - and she has quite a few blonde moments. Cliches are important here - and it is also important that you do not have issues with them ... otherwise the movie will feel like torture.\n\nCringe and all what you may be saying. The movie is also quite self aware - the dialog is quite funny. Again not always pc, but you shouldn&apos;t expect something like that from a movie from that era anyway. Acting is good, some physical comedy and a lot of winking at the audience ... they knew what they had to deliver for them ... and I reckon it still can work ... it&apos;s all on you!

      "reviewBody": "This movie was well put together.  It showed many facets of DJing and the DJs themselves.  It is not everyday that you see &quot;Out Of Character&quot; interviews with most of these legendary DJs.  Instead of seeing &quot;DJs&quot; in interviews you see &quot;people who like being DJs&quot; in interviews (hopefully you followed that).  IE.  Instead of seeing an interview with Mix Master Mike you saw an interview with Maxwell Schwartz and he explained why he likes being a DJ and being Mix Master Mike and what and who inspired and inspires him.  You also get to see what the families of these DJs had to deal with as they were starting out which is quite interesting.  As far as interviews go the common issue most people could have is that DJ Jazzy Jeff and DJ Cash Money from Philadelphia were not in it. Regardless, seeing Afrika Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay (The Original Jazzy Jay) and other Hip Hop originators was worth the price of the movie.  You don&apos;t see or hear from these people everyday.  The only other issue is more of an industry issue where there was only one female DJ interviewed but that is just a sad reflection of the Hip Hop DJ industry. There should and could have been more interviews with more female DJs...they are out there.  This is a movie where a parent who remembers the good ol&apos; days of Hip Hop would appreciate it and they would bring their children to see it.  It shows that Hip Hop and the art of DJing has evolved and is not just &quot;As it is!&quot; I&apos;m a house DJ and scratching is not something that is done in House music but I love this movie.  Don&apos;t get it twisted I&apos;ve always been a fan of Hip Hop. Great Movie.  Cheers."
