Big improvement on my casting distance.\n\nThe 4-star rating is for Backcountry, the rod itself is easy 5-stars. It did not indicate that the 10wt was the 1091-4 model (special Pike/Musky rod) instead of the standard 1090-4. From what I can tell, the only difference is a slightly longer fighting butt and I actually kind of love it, so not a big deal for me personally.",

The material is great at covering my backpack and is comfortable to be left on the backpack and worn. I just wish I would have ordered a size XS instead of a small one. The cover has too much extra space and is only necessary when I need to take my referee jacket and track pants off and keep them dry.",

I bought these primarily for bike commuting in the northwest coast of British Columbia and they&apos;ve kept me completely dry with water coming from all directions. The large/tall are a perfect fit for me (6&apos;4&quot; 175lbs). Have yet to trial these on extended hikes, but I&apos;m optimistic that the light weight and solid waterproofing will make them a good addition to the gear. Only change I would make right now would be to have a front pocket rather than a rear pocket. Will see if they are durable in the long term, but I&apos;ve been using an OR rain jacket for the past 6 years and it&apos;s still keeping me dry so hopefully these pants meet that standard.",

The last one I got came with a light-gray + gray configuration which helps those (perfectionist and self-diagnosed OCD) climbers like me tell them apart.\n\nPlease make that gorgeous runner available for purchase separately!",

From the ripstop cuffs (truly the beefiest I have ever owned, counting past ORs, North Face, HH), to the avy beacon pocket (there are 2 options - armpit or right thigh), to the smart placement of the stretchy GTX panels, these have been fantastic. Other reviewers have mentioned being cold in them, but I havent had that experience. I live in CO and regularly ski in single digits or slightly below zero F with only a base layer underneath and have never felt cold (outside of 1st chair when you sit down and the chair is still frozen solid). They are fantastic for touring - great range of mobility, excellent venting, good storage. Also just as good on resort days. A",

Undoubtedly the most comfortable bibs I&apos;ve used and I&apos;ve never gotten wet in them, unlike my previous bibs made by another brand. They&apos;re surprisingly thin so I I do use other snow pants for work activities like dragging brush and digging in the dirt, but they&apos;ll keep you dry in the snow and slush without feeling cumbersome during high-output activities. Mine are 2 seasons old so I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;ve changed at all. 6&apos; and 180 lbs in a size Large.",

I ended up buying a large for a more relaxed fit/layering and have no regrets on sizing. Overall they feel high quality and are wind/water proof as advertised. Even in cold temps despite being only a shell they hold body heat well with a mid weight base layer. I&apos;ve got 7 resort days with them so far mostly in the glades and bumps and while they are very comfortable they already have small tears in the reinforced cuffs from my ski edges. Also the button at the top of the side entry zipper broke on the 2nd day simply unbuttoning it. That button isn&apos;t necessary, but a little disappointing given the price point. Would be 5 stars without these quality issues out the gate.",

I&apos;m 5&apos;9 155lbs with a slightly athletic build, and the small fits perfect for me. I am really happy about the durability of the scuff guards and overall material. The zippers do not catch either and allow plenty of venting. They&apos;re comfy, allows plenty of room to layer, and good flexibility to move. I have about 6 days on them so far (5 resort, 1 backcountry) and my only complaint would be that I would have hoped for an extra pocket or two and maybe a reinforced knee given how expensive they are. Overall, quality is high but a small knock for lack of the previously mentioned features given the price point.",

I should&apos;ve paid attention to what different reviews were saying on different sites. This Stetson &quot;Jackson Hat&quot; is clearly flawed in its sizing; sizing that Stetson has clearly failed in making this hat. It&apos;s clearly apparent that this specific hat is made/sized completely wrong. They&apos;re too small! Stetson&apos;s molds or whatever they&apos;re using to make the sizing of these specific &quot;Jackson&quot; hats are clearly wrong. \n\nThis is frustrating and disappointing because a company like Stetson should NOT be having any sizing issues in their production. They&apos;ve been around way too long to have inconsistent sizing on their main product - HATS! Not even stretching this hat with a hat stretcher, for over three weeks, has helped. Obviously because when they make these hats and put them through the hot water and other systems to make them, they&apos;re going to always go back to the shape that they made them - which again, Stetson, your sizing on these hats is wrong!!! Do better Stetson! You&apos;re well known for one thing... Fix your sizing issues!",

        "reviewBody": "It is well constructed.  The &apos;sage&apos; is actually a dark green (think &quot;Christmas elf&quot;) which was slightly disappointing.  The felt has a bit of fur (some sites say 5% fur + merino wool) and is much denser and softer than their 100% wool crushers.  This should make it a better outdoor hat, more wind and rain resistant, but the felt is rather light and thin - akin to a nice town hat.  I don&apos;t care for the bash but it should reshape easily with a bit of steam.  \n\nStetson has it&apos;s own info wrong:  there is a tag on it that says &quot;100% wool&quot; - it&apos;s not.  Another tag says crushable - I wouldn&apos;t recommend it.  They also say bound edge but it is raw, as seen in the pics.  Likewise, they say the sweatband is &quot;Dri-lex leather&quot; which isn&apos;t a thing, it&apos;s just Dri-lex.   As for size: I&apos;m 57cm and found a Med to be too tight.  It wore fine tilted back like a hipster but I couldn&apos;t pull it down in front comfortably for proper use outdoors.  I&apos;m returning it and continuing my hunt for a quality felt woods hat.  Hope this helps.",

The material feels top quality but unfortunately the cut of the jersey didn&apos;t work for me (long sleeves, short everywhere else, lol). I&apos;m 5&apos;6 127 lbs and the jersey was too short through the back and torso.  I tried a size Medium which fit more snug like a jersey should but it rode up terribly; size Large was too baggy in the chest and still rode up. Definitely didn&apos;t work with shorts; may be a better jersey to pair with bibs, which may help keep the jersey in place better. I&apos;ll be looking for a different jersey in a similar color.",

In the medium with an r1 on I could barely get it to zip up. But the large fits perfect. They are very stretchy and the BD dry stuff works great. I use them for touring and resort stuff and I will probably never own anything different as long as BD keeps making these.",

The built in belt is nice but not very functional. Curious to see how well the breath and can dump heat touring w only side zips",

I wanted something that would handle both front side and the back country....as well as something with reinforced gators.  I had cheaper Mountain Hardwear pants that weren&apos;t reinforced in the gator area and didn&apos;t hold out the snow.   I really liked the fit of the Recon and they really hold in wet conditions.  However, I&apos;m disappointed with the durability.  After 3 days of skiing (2 at Alta and 1 in the back country), I noticed that the gators were ripped and giving way.  I get that it might happen, but not after a few days of skiing.  So, the main reason that I purchased the pants is now out the window. Was hoping for better from these.",

She’s on the cusp of her 12M Patagonia jacket from last season being too small; the 18M Patagonia I bought this year is too big but will fit all winter. I bought this Columbia one in 12/18M, and it was the perfect length in arms and torso, but it was tight around her toddler belly; she’d have grown out of it in a couple weeks. Exchanged for an 18/24M and it will definitely fit her for the full winter now.",

I’ve previously used lifestraw while hiking, with no issues and the bottle seemed like a no brainer. What an expensive mistake. The water tastes disgusting. Foul. Plasticky. The water tastes like latex smells. I’m not joking. The first taste made me vomit. And that was after cleaning the bottle, lid, mouthpiece, and prepping the filter as per the instructions. So I cleaned, rinsed, and tried again. Still foul. Still gag worthy. At least I didn’t vomit! Several cleans, rinses, and different water later, and it still tastes foul. Sorry guys, this is a no from me. And these things are EXPENSIVE as here in Australia. A big let down.",

        "reviewBody": "I have a Ford Bronco, and previously owned a Jeep Wrangler.  In both cases, the tailgate mounted spare tire and the swing out operation, made it difficult using my hitch mounted bike rack.  I previously had a hitch extension, but while that allowed clearance for the tire, I couldn’t fully open the tailgate.  Enter the Pivot 2.  I saw this on social media and was instantly impressed, mounting to the hitch (much like an extension) and in turn mounting my bike rack to the Pivot 2.  I chose Driver’s side, so (as viewed from the rear of the vehicle) it pivots to the Driver’s side of the vehicle, while my tailgate opens to the passenger side.  I’ve seen a YouTube video of someone using the opposite pivot option and it is still functional, with the Pivot 2 at its fullest position, it clears room for the tailgate in its 90 degree position.  With the Driver’s side, it’s a non issue, so that’s my recommendation.",

With the design of our van it&apos;s nice to have access to our kitchen in the rear and this swing away allows us to keep the bikes locked to the rack and still have access to the rear of the vehicle. \n\nAssembly is super easy and only takes a couple minutes. The product is overbuilt and seems like it will last for decades. The only complaint I have with the product is it&apos;s a little heavy. Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality swing away they can count on lasting for years.",

Most of the higher-end road shoes have gone super wide due to a vocal market demographic (at least according to what I&apos;m reading on the internets) so I&apos;ve been trying a bunch recently and wanted to share my experience. \r\n\r\nI was interested to try these Lake shoes because folks were complaining about them being too narrow, which is usually a good sign for me. Comparing them to other shoes I&apos;ve worn recently (Shimano RC903 - too wide, Spesh S-Works 7 -- great but not made anymore, S-Works Torch -- too wide for me), they were a bit different than I expected. In terms of shape, the fit is pretty excellent, probably on the narrow side and they work pretty well for my feet. They don&apos;t offer that extra toe box room that some of the more modern fits offer and honestly I kind of learned to like that in the S-Works 7. Another big difference between the shoes I&apos;ve listed is the materials. The leather upper is almost patent-leather-glossy, as a result they&apos;re super stiff out of the box and not in a good way. Compared to other manufacturer&apos;s models using Dynema or similar lightweight synthetics they&apos;re way less &quot;foot conforming&quot; and kind of notibably squeak around while riding. I imagine they might soften up over time, but after a couple hundred miles they&apos;re still pretty squeaky. Less of a concern but the sole is also some super high gloss carbon, rather than the matte that most modern shoes are using. The result is a little more slippery when walking and a little squeaky against the pedal as well (using SPD-SL cleat that are usually pretty quiet). The BOA dials are nice but pretty much table stakes these days, and they don&apos;t get all that tight due to the stiffness of the upper material. BOAs aside, materials-wise they remind me of shoes that were on the market 10-15 years ago, and they&apos;re not all that light as a result (esp for a &quot;climbing shoe&quot;). \r\n\r\nThe quality seems great but the approach seems antiquated. It would be great to see Lake adapt this fit with more modern materials.",

The heel lift is so bad they are simply unrideable and there&apos;s nothing you can adjust. I tested them out in the living room and could practically pull my foot out of the boot. Such a shame because I have yet to find another boot that is simultaneously as comfortable and as high-performance as the old Malamutes",

        "reviewBody": "I got my first pair of Malamutes in 2004, and last week my fourth pair  (purchased about 2020) had a side seam&apos;s stitching rip out, I&apos;m guessing due to flexing rather than rot as I always use a passive dryer on my boots immediately after using them, the same dryer I&apos;ve been using for about 25 years.  I was planning to go to my local shop to get a new pair, noticed when I googled that there is now both a Boa and the traditional speed pull system I love so much, so I breathed a sigh of relief that the traditional system was still available.  I was glad to know I would not have to use Boas, as I have some arthritis of the hand and I get more than enough twisting of Boas tightening the boots of my younger snowboarding students (I have taught snowboarding (and trained new instructors) 2 to 3 days a week for 20 years.)  I have seen enough broken Boas in the past 15 years to want to steer away from them forever.  I see you sell online now and I chanced to read the current reviews for the speed pull model, which are not good.  It is obvious that in the move to a Boa-dominated economy that you have lost the engineering fine points and quality that made the Malamute the gold standard of snowboard boots.  I really don&apos;t want to use Boas, I just want the Malamute with its excellent heel hold harness, liner lock, and speed pull, locking outer laces back, in the quality, performance, and durability levels of the past.  Please go back to the old design soon, or make changes as needed to bring back the excellent levels of performance and reliability of the past.  I was just demonstrating all the great adjustments and design points of my Malamutes to a first-year instructor last week.  Now I will have to tell him what I have found out the last couple of days reading reviews about the current product.  Please note, I wrote this to communicate with you, not the public, so feel free to not publish this on your website, but PLEASE bring your quality and design back - unless I can find a cobbler able to repair my current Malamutes (which are softened up after the 200 or so days I have on them, so I was just going to replace them), I expect I will be buying another company&apos;s boots, and I doubt they will match my Malamutes.",

        "reviewBody": "If you are reading this review, you probably rode Malamutes for years because they had an exceptional internal harness system that worked perfectly with the inner liner. Firm ankle hold with no heel lift. Stiff, responsive, and aggressive. Prior to 2021, the Malamute was the best snowboard boot ever made. This is not controversial, there&apos;s a booming secondary market for 2020 Malamutes. I would happily pay triple-retail to get a pair of 10.5s.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 boot is still broken. \r\n* The internal harness is on the boot, not the liner.\r\n* The liner has too much padding to create a tight fit. This is not a performance liner. \r\n* The internal harness system maxes out in tightness before becoming tight enough to prevent heel lift. \r\n\r\nI have larger-than-average ankles. If I can&apos;t get these tight enough to prevent an *inch* of heel lift, then nobody can. I&apos;m not wearing them too big. I know how to size boots. The design is flawed. If I am getting this much heel lift when the liner is new, it&apos;s going to get worse as they pack out. \r\n\r\nSalomon: just go back to the old design. It was perfect. I get that it&apos;s cheaper to put the same liner in a bunch of different boots. It&apos;s also bad product design. \r\n\r\nThe reviews about reliability are also true. I popped an eyelet off the first time laced these up.",

        "reviewBody": "First things first, the tread, fit, and lateral stiffness of the boot are all great--if it wasn&apos;t for my next and only issue these would be my favorite boots to-date. But unfortunately said issue is durability and is quickly rendering these boots unusable. I&apos;ve ridden them for 11 days total and they&apos;re effectively falling apart. Day 3, one of the top plastic eyelets popped from its screw, thankfully I was able to recover the eyelet and washer and my hillside board shop where I bought the boots put a new screw in it for free same-day. Day 7, one of my speed laces snapped (no, I do not rest the edge of my board on my boot while on the lift) and, again, my board shop came to the rescue and replaced it for free with something similar next-day. Day 11 another plastic eyelet popped and I&apos;ve been able to recover the eyelet and the screw but not the washer, haven&apos;t gone in for repair yet. At this point, these boots need a repair every 3-4 days of riding which is completely unacceptable for a top end boot. After doing a thorough inspection of the boots before this review I&apos;m seeing my other original lace (11 days old) is frayed and ready to snap, 4/6 fabric eyelet binders on right boot and 3/6 fabric eyelet binders on the left boot are frayed and ready to go. For context, I&apos;m 6&apos;1&quot;, 200lb, all-mountain rider (have not been able to take these into the back country yet) ride regular in Jones Meteorite bindings on either the Salomon Assassin twin or Jones Stratos directional (bindings and assassin bought at beginning of the season, Stratos and boots bought Jan 27, boots professionally fitted). If you ride consistently week-in week-out like I do then do not buy these boots, at this rate they won&apos;t even last half a season.",

So I try to keep it to the lowest setting &amp; keep stirring what I&apos;m cooking. I&apos;ve got to use this 3 times on backpacking trips &amp; each of those times I&apos;ve used it for reheating purposes. I&apos;ve made and froze spaghetti, chicken enchiladas &amp; tacos. Using this pan made for delicious 1st night meals. I suggest bringing a piece of foil to use for a lid &amp; helping recirculate the heat.  I fit the pan easily in the bottom section of my Deuter AirContact 55+10, along with my sleeping pad,  sleeping bag, &amp; compressible pillow with the pan going in last covering everything which is nice so the zipper doesn&apos;t snag my stuff.

It&apos;s simple, seems durable, and sits nicely in a canoe.  But it is NOT a good fit for carrying across longer portages.  It has no waist belt to help bear the load, very little padding on the shoulder straps, and no structure or padding of any kind against your back.  It might be perfect for carrying a few yards from your boat to a shoreline campsite, but it&apos;s painful on days with multiple 100+ rod portages.",

The internal mesh pockets are nice to hold my wallet and other small items. The attachment mechanism is very easy to adjust and so easy to take on and off the rack. For reference, I am using them on a cyclocross bike with the Axiom Streamliner Disc DLX rack. I have more than enough heel clearance since the bags are small and the rack puts them further rearward. The panniers are well built and feel heavy duty. Can&apos;t wait to use them for bikepacking trips and picnics with my wife.",

Also great to have on to pick up produce or a 6 packs :)\r\n\r\nI do almost all my riding on gravel.... very secure attachment.  Top attachment points can be adjusted narrower/wider to perfectly fit the rack and prevent forward/backward movement.  Adjustable rotating latch on the bottom prevents tipping away from the rack when cornering / windy days / bumps, etc.  Nice organizational mesh pockets on the interior.

I’ve taken it on several trips now and am happy with the amount in holds, the layout of the sections, and the features it has. \r\nThe only thing that prevents this bag from being perfect for me are the shoulder straps. I chose a bag without a chest strap because I was not looking for a hiking backpack, and wanted something that looked a bit nicer. However, the shoulder straps feel as if they are constantly sliding off of my shoulders. I regularly have to pull them back on so the bag doesn’t slip down onto my arms.",

However, in less than a year the edge at the lower back started to discolour and eventually broken. I suspect the fabric folded out at the lower edge creates a weak spot for abrasion with the lower back. I did not rewax the bag but I suspect one has to rewax that part rather frequently to avoid damage. I sincerely hope Fjallraven could make the fabric flat and add reinforce on that part like other hiking pack brands as it is such a beautiful looking bag.

        "reviewBody": "I first received the Raven 20 in Dusk as a gift four years ago. I fell in love — lightweight, durable, great style. It was never completely waterproof, even after several layers of wax, but its trim profile and capacious organization made it feel like a bag both smaller and larger than its size. I used it everyday for two years, until it developed a tear on the bottom, where the G-1000 failed; other reviewers have posted photos similar to what happened on mine. Fjallraven did a warranty repair, and the bottom lasted for two more years of travel, hiking, bike commuting, and photography work until it ripped again. The real problem, however, was the zipper on the smaller of the two large compartments kinked and then unthreaded from the bag. Support mentioned that a repair of this nature would be incredibly difficult to fix, and were generous enough to offer me a replacement Raven 20 in the new style. This new bag feels just as robust, and the mesh backer is a nice change from the previous model’s standard fabric. I miss my old style bag, but I’m hopeful this new one will take me on as many adventures, though hopefully for more than just 4 years. Still, huge thanks to the Fjallraven support team. This is still my magic bag.",

It had the perfect amount of pockets for pens, personal toiletries, extra battery packs, tripod, protein bars, water bottle, sun block, rain jacket, small towel, and other must have “in case of” items.\nThe two main compartments go deep for additional items, which I like to organize with packing cubes.\nThe backpack has now been upgraded as my travel back pack and it will also double as my work lap top back pack.\nReason for the 4 stars? Fjallraven absolutely needs to add a carry on sleeve. We traveled with a carry on and the bag got a bit heavy at times, I wish I could have set it down on the carry on. Thankfully, the craftsmanship makes it easy to carry with heavier items. I am barely at 5ft, and this bag fit perfect on my frame.\nIt would also be nice to see additional options to clip on carabiners, water bottles or your phone, built into the front of the straps.",

        "reviewBody": "I have used solar proof for the last 2 years on my backpacking tent. My little tent was already 7 years old and it was not leaking and I didn&apos;t want it to start. My experience has been on a couple hundred nites on the AT &amp; CDT with plenty of rain.\r\n\r\nFinding the concentrate is great. Now I mix my own in the old 17oz spray bottle. 5 oz of concentrate and then fill w water. Big money saver.\r\n\r\n I would solar proof my rain fly and the bottom of my tent. It was always adequate on the rain fly and it works on the bottom but it wears off faster there, so i tent sealed the interior floor most recently. I have also used it on my cycling tent which is a hubba hubba and it got old and I have reseam sealed it and I use solarproof every year on the rainfly. So far my tent is waterproof. I can feel the difference on the tent. It feels brand new and slippery again after I&apos;m done. \r\nThis is an easy product to apply on a damp tent. Just have a dry rag handy to spread it around and make sure there&apos;s not pools and drips of it and then you let it dry while the tent is set up.",

        "reviewBody": "I have a tent that is ~9 years old and in excellent condition (no tears, no rips, clean inside and out, always put away bone dry and stored in a cool place). Unfortunately, water had started leaking through the rain fly. I&apos;m not talking about through the seams, I&apos;m talking about through the sidewall fabric. I mixed up this concentrated Nikwax Solarproof up according to the directions and have tried applying this to the underside of the fly and outer side of the fly. I have tried applying it to the fly when dry, when wet, by spraying it on, by rubbing it in with my hand... nothing works. In fact, when applying this to the outside of the rain fly, whether by hand or spray, it actually leaks through the fly, resulting in drips on the inside of the fly that I have to wipe down as well. Maybe this would work in extending the life of a good rain fly, I haven&apos;t tested that, but in terms of breathing new life into a rainfly that already leaks - don&apos;t waste your money - I already wasted mine and am writing this review to save yours.",

The dress boot is super comfortable and flattering, and is not as clunky as the regular styles. These boots can easily be worn with both a dress or jeans. If you can only buy one pair of Blundstones, these are a great option for versatility. This style does run a full size larger than other Blundstone styles (I wear a U.S. 7/AUS 4 in 550?s and a U.S. 6/AUS 3 in the dress boot).",

The first pair I owned, I got in a 4.5 (7.5 US) and they fit a little tight at first but now they fit like a glove. The dress boots do run fairly large in my opinion. I originally ordered a 4.5 but had to size down a couple of times and ended up with a 3.5 (6.5 US) and am so happy I did! The Backcountry customer support was amazing and so helpful every time I called for an exchange. I?m only putting 4 stars because I had to exchange twice but it was never a bad experience. Get these boots!",

My only complaint is that they only have 1 back pocket - and you will not be able to get your phone in there. However, I wasn’t able to test them in the long run. I had to return them because these pants ARE true to size / size guide is correct for the XS. But there’s no XXS option :( I thought I’d give them a try anyway, but as someone with very narrow hips (31”), these are way too roomy in that area and it looks like you’re wearing some sort of balloon pants. If you do have regular/wider hips, they would be extremely cute. But I wish these were offered in more inclusive sizing.",

Since I own some pretty pricey sleeping bags, I&apos;m happy to have this liner to help preserve and protect them. It is very well made and a great design.

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While this is a liner for a sleeping bag I would definitely use it on its own in the summer where I am because it can get hot camping. The fabric is made to be cool wicking and the fiber is woven with the tencel to keep away mosquitoes. The liner can withstand about 30 washes for it still to be effective against bug repelling. I will only wash it a couple times a season so it should last quite a few seasons. I have a different brand mummy bag and the liner still fits inside nice. I also like that the bottom has a draw cord so I can easily wear it around the fire at the campsite. Both myself at 5&apos;3 and my husband at 6&apos;1 can fit into this liner comfortably. I am very excited to use this liner all season while camping. So far no bug bites after one night of use. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",

        "reviewBody": "I am making my second trip up Denali this spring.  Last trip I used my Spantiks.  I love those boots, but they do not keep my feet warm, as I have some circulation issues.  This go around the decision to go with an 8000 meter boot was an easy one and since I&apos;ve never had fit issues with Sportiva, the new Oly Mons Cube was what I purchased.  Out of the box - they are beautiful boots!  Everything about them appears to be extremely well done and the quality appears to be off the charts..........until you put them on and start climbing!!!!  The outer shell crushes my upper ankle / lower shin on both feet.  It is so apparent and painful that I find it hard to believe that LaSportiva is not racing to fix this issue!!!  There is absolutely no way I could survive 20 days on Denali with these boots.  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a liner issue or an outer shell issue but right where the boots flexes - right where my ankle flexes is like there is a hard, plastic pipe around my ankle and every step you feel this think flex hard against my ankle.  \n\nAs is mentioned in the other reviews, I will try my Spantik liners or Intuition Liners.  Very dissapointing for a $1200.00 boot!!",

        "reviewBody": "A quick note on fitting crampons with the ski tech inserts on these boots.  I couldn&apos;t find much info on pairing crampons with these elsewhere on the internet.  \n\nThe ski tech inserts make the front toe bails very wide, so they don&apos;t fit most semi-automatic crampons.  I bought these boots in a 48 (admittedly a large boot) and only found one semi-automatic crampon that fit reliably: the Grivel G-12 with the cramp-o-matic bindings.  The BD Sabretooths, Petzl Vasaks, and Grivel G14s with the New-Matic bindings did not fit.  The poor fit was not a length issue.  \n\nAutomatic crampons seemed to fit a little better.  The Petzl Sarkens with the wire toe bail and the Camp Alpinists both had wide enough toe bails to accommodate the ski tech bindings.  But I prefer semi-automatic crampons for less technical glaciated mountains where I&apos;m doing more uphill walking and not climbing vertical ice.\n\nIf you want to avoid the issue altogether and won&apos;t use the boots for skiing, I&apos;d buy the Olympus Mons Cube S.  The &quot;S&quot; version doesn&apos;t have the ski tech inserts.  (Absolutely no clue why Sportiva labeled the non-ski version with an &quot;S.&quot;)\n\nOther than the crampon issue, these are great, though I agree with other reviews about the liners.  They have a weird fold at the top that rubs your shins when you aren&apos;t wearing over-the-calf mountaineering socks.  Liners from the Spantiks solve the issue.\n\nAs far as fit goes, I wear a 13 street shoe and a 47 in the Sportiva Trango Tower Extremes, which I fit a bit tighter for ice climbing.  The 48 gave me some extra room to wiggle my toes, but it didn&apos;t feel too loose.",

        "reviewBody": "Summary - The best 8000m boot out there, but be ready to buy alternative liners.\n\nI purchased the Oly Mons Cube for Everest and tested them out this weekend in the White Mountains doing 17 miles and 9000 ft elevation gain. Comfy, warm and light boot around my feet but they ripped my shins apart. My shins were in severe pain, plus were blistered and bleeding requiring considerable time out of the boot to recover. It was the liners. I am extremely disappointed in their liners and I wouldn&apos;t survive a few days wearing these on Everest, and not what you would expect from a $1200 boot!\n\nI have a pair of Spantiks I used to climb Denali (which are comfy btw, but not suitable for Everest). I dropped in my Spantik liner, they are way comfier with the Oly Mons Cube and make a great replacement. The tongue at the front°of the liner is the key (no tongue on the Oly Mons Cube liner), it stops all the chaffing.  I hear from a guide friend the Baruntse liner also works well, or even better replace with an intuition liner with a tongue.\n\nI am a size 12 US, and always go up a size (bought size 47 / US 13) in all my La Sportiva boots.",

        "reviewBody": "When I heard the Olympus Mons were being updated with the boa system it wasn&apos;t even a question of if I wanted to try them, but whether I could get a pair before leaving for Nepal this season. They arrived soon after their release but just before the Everest season was canceled...and so the boots sat in their box likely due to the disappointment that all my gear packed would now be set aside for adventures on a date unknown.\n\nYesterday though I couldn&apos;t hold off trying them on any longer and they are everything and more I could have hoped for. This is of course a review based on never having them outside my quarantined home, but I have never tried on a mountaineering boot and had them be this comfortable right out of the box. Light, nimble feeling on the mountain, I think I may have done a happy dance in them after getting them on. The boa system is a game changer as for years frozen fingers and trying to tie up my boots has been a struggle I never looked forward to, but that is gone. \n\nBut it is not just the boa system. The zipper securely runs the foot and along up the calf in a way which feels like it keeps the boot more flush to your leg and physically follows a natural line. The inner boot begins with a slipper like sock that then slips into the inner boot. Both feel an improvement upon the previous design. \n\nEverything about this boot makes me happy and of course will know more once I am on the mountain with them, but my initial love is deep and ever devoted. Worth every dollar and more.",

I am able to confidently use it on small and awkward foot holds, but I trust it just as much on volumes and smearing!\n\nI do wish the heel kept its shape and fit after several months of wear. I&apos;ve found that the heel loosens slightly. While it doesn&apos;t loosen to the point to where they&apos;re no longer effective, I personally think it loosens enough to lose some confidence when heel hooking smaller holds. I understand the shoe will stretch over time, but I downsized considerably so there shouldn&apos;t be any excuse for them to not fit well especially as a guy wearing the women&apos;s versions which is supposed to be lower volume.\n\nOverall, I am more than satisfied with the shoe.

It&apos;s comfortable and the strap allows me to snug it up tight so that the heel stays on with heel hooks. If you&apos;re looking for a Jack (or Jill!) of all trades, this is the shoe for you!",

I too have been actively riding for 25+ years and can confidently say these are some of the best compression shorts I have worn.  The seemless legs are super comfortable and stay in place.  There are no bulky seams and the padding is top notch.  From my experience, this is where you notice cheaper shorts the most...bulky uncomfortable, this or stiff pads.  These disappear which is why you get what you pay for.  Lastly, they are made to fit snug and fit true to size.  I wear the same size in these as all other compression shorts.",

Drys in the morning, nymphs and streamers through the day, and big drys or even mice at night. I like a pack that I can carry everything I need for the day but also a pack that’s not to big or bulky. Easy access to everything needed. Seems like the bigger the pack, the more we carry that’s unneeded. Another great feature is the multiple different ways this pack can be worn. I love packs that have the ability to connect direct to your wader straps",

Would gladly give it 5 star except that the zipper on the workstation/fly garage section ALWAYS catches on material inside the compartment when trying to unzip, which results in a necessary 2 handed tug of war to get it opened. Really frustrating for sure. Also the elastic on the floatant velcro is not adjustable so not every bottle will stay firmly held.",

        "reviewBody": "Bought these for a road trip through three national parks. I only wore them for about an hour ahead of the trip to break them in. Didn&apos;t need a breaking in period at all! These shoes were very comfortable, had no pain, blisters, or anything when without a breaking in period. Provided great stability on rocky and uneven trails in the mountain. The traction was great and felt super grippy. I also enjoy how light the shoes are - makes the longer hikes that much more enjoyable. Can&apos;t wait to wear these on more hikes! Only complaint is the integrated tongue. Wish it had more give to loosen the laces as the top of the shoe felt a bit tight at time.",

Lovely paint scheme, and the gold matches tan side walls spectacularly.\n\nThe bad: Getting the steerer shim in feels bad. The tolerance is far too tight. Following their online instructions to use carbon paste, and then push it in works... but it&apos;s never coming out. It&apos;s a very snugg fit and, it made properly preloading the headset a headache.\n\nI don&apos;t mind integrated cables and the extra faff when replacing a headset, but I fear I won&apos;t be able to remove mine with out rerunning all new hydraulic lines, because they&apos;ll get crushed and damaged when attempting to take the bars off.\n\nI also wish it had a little more tire/rim clearance. I can&apos;t use my hunt limitless wheels on it because there&apos;s not sufficient clearance for them.",

        "reviewBody": "Sold my old Fast Noah when another very popular aero road bike was available via a race team I was riding for. I no longer race and enjoy doing fast group rides &amp; having fun. Wanted a second bike that was unique, fast, and held its own against more recognized brands. Standard Noah was only 100 grams heavier than the Fast,  With the frame savings I purchased higher-end components and wheels, which more than made up for the weight difference. It seems every bit as fast as my popular aero bike and is nearly 2 lbs lighter. The stiff frame 25mm tires gives a rather harsh ride, switching to 28mm tires made a huge difference, with no loss in speed. The bike performs every bit as well a most of the expensive super bikes out there while costing thousands less...it simply works as advertised",

This harness turned out to be just perfect for someone with such muscular legs. It&apos;s equipped with four loops for gear, adjustable leg straps (and generously sized ones at that!), and it provides a comfortable fit around the waist. We opted for a Large size since I&apos;m planning to take him ice climbing, and I want him to have enough room for layers underneath.",

Women’s harnesses were too small in the waist (only carrying up to size “L” frequently) and men’s harnesses had small leg loops. \n\nI ordered this harness having never heard of the brand. I did my research and found that this is a reputable, affordable, effective harness for gym climbing as well as outdoor climbing. \n\nIt fits like a glove! The waist and leg loops are super adjustable. And the tails tuck into elastic loops so you don’t have any hanging material. \n\nI love the bright green color, too. It feels fun and a bit less masc than navy or black.",

Add a removable label to ID wine, varietal and date. After use, remove label, rinse three times with clean water to remove residue. When back in town, rinse and fill with warm water. Let sit one day, drain and refill. After three rinses, drain/shake out water residues, turn upside down and allow the container to air dry for a few days. They can be used up to about 10 times, even for bold red wines. Have also used for standard hard liquor (40%/80 proof), and worked effectively. Neither wine or alcohol show up on x-ray inspection units. Never. The recommendation to add a cap retraint for lid is a good one. Lids can get misplaced.",

I like the longer sleeves which have an extended and soft cuff, which offer very good length possibilities. And I like the shell which is more resistant to clingy things which will stick to soft shells. My first impression, before ride, was that it might be too light and not adequate cold protection. It does have very good wind blocking, as I had worn it a short time outdoors before the ride, without any layers underneath. This is a good jacket and surprised me.",

        "reviewBody": "I had a winter jacket that gets the job done but it is somewhat bulky and difficult to pack away if it warms up while you are on a ride.  Enter the Unlimited Puffy Jacket.  This jacket is extremely warm in relation to its weight.  It also packs away and could fit in a jersey pocket although I typically put it on my bar bag.  The jacket is rated to go down to freezing but if you layer underneath given the wind resistance of the jacket it would be fine in the low 20&apos;s no problem.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not five is that I do get a bit of wind flap on the shoulders over 20mph.  Nothing horrendous but it is noticeable and I would expect near perfection at this price point.  I really like the look of the jacket and the pockets are easy to access you gear/food.  I would buy the jacket again no question and would recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight but packable option for winter riding.",

I called the customer service rep to see if I could swap out the jacket for a Large. They provided a prepaid Fedex shipping label to return the M and at the same time sent me the L. The large fits great and I&apos;ve used it twice in the rain and it seems to be fine. The front zipper lays down close to the jacket and requires you to give a little extra attention when you zip the jacket up. Not a deal breaker. I like the color, the fit and length. Btw, the jacket dropped in price twice during this time and the customer service was so kind to refund me that delta.",

I ordered and XL and they were a little big but they didn&apos;t have any lages left so I was going to live with it. Except the moment I stepped outside I felt a breeze on my inner thigh. I examined the area and there were multiple holes in the seam. I went to return the product and they were trying to charge for shipping for a product that has a history of being defective and arrived defective. I called to get more details and the person I spoke too said they didn&apos;t have any left to even try and exchange and the only money I could get was in store credit. Not pleased. The only I&apos;ll be ordering from this store again is to use my online credit.",

Nice wide waistband to help avoid rolling and cutting into your side.  I wanted to love these, but ended up returning because of the fit.  They were very snug in the waist and around the thighs.  The seams on my thighs looked distorted due to how tight they were.  I am a very solid size medium (US size 8-10 in most pants and dresses).  I would have tried exchanging for a size up but I am short and the medium was already a bit long.  I assume the large would be longer.",

I saw the green color and decided I would order it based on my experience with the same bag.  The green bag I received is not the same bag as pictured.  Instead of the mesh zippered side pockets, mine has water bottle cage mounts.  Instead of a rounded solid fabric top, this green one has a flat top (I call it Frankenstein&apos;s Monster, now) with a translucent slot for map or cell phone.  It still fits perfectly into the Ortlieb quick release mount that I have on all my bikes and it stays in place, as expected.  Also, the product description list it as 7L, but the box states that it is 6.5L (I&apos;m guessing .5L is lost to the flat top).....that&apos;s quite a bit of space to give up for something this size.",

Heat molding is a necessity -- they won&apos;t feel right the first time out of the box. Takes multiple tries to get them right, but then they are perfect. Worth the effort. Blue/black a great departure from white or black. Fit seems to be a little small. MSRP ridiculous, but often go on sale.",

Be patient, as everyone reports that they feel terrible right out of the box. They are also not ver comfortable off the bike, but once clipped in the connection to the pedals is fantastic. For me, the wide toe box is a game changer as my feet were getting pinched by all of my prior shoes. These shoes are not featherweights, but I think the terrific power transfer is worth a bit of extra weight. Quality of materials is absolutely first rate and the iridescent blue is very striking.",

The wide toe box is really welcome after years of wearing shoes that were too narrow. The feeling of connection to the pedals and power transfer is really amazing. All of the materials are top notch quality and they seem really well made. Not light by any means but I think the fit makes up for it. I will say they are pretty uncomfortable off the bike.",

Using the Lake sizing guide for my first pair I got a 44.5, but it was too small and exchanged for a 45 which fits my 110mm wide feet great. More than enough room in the toe box for me and comfortable all around after oven molding.

But nothing is like putting on these shoes, warm out of the oven, and shaping them to your feet before a big ride. The kangaroo uppers handle crashes great - they don&apos;t scar easily. Plus, they get softer and softer over time. The BOAs work great for adjusting on the fly, and with a little saddle soap, they stay looking new, crash marks and all. I wear an 11 E dress shoe, and if you have a wide foot, these wides are perfect. When group riding with Type A bikers, I have gotten dropped twisting my BOAs because these LAKEs do get a little looser and require a tad more periodic tightening. That&apos;s the price of wearing a shoe that&apos;s made with succulent kangaroo glove leather, and where SIDIs may have the tiniest edge. That said, these LAKEs are very stiff and light, and just fine for sprints, climbs, and racing - just keep them snug. You deserve this shoe.",

They said I&apos;d want to consider the 44 wide even though my foot isn&apos;t wide by normal standards, I wear a D width shoe and think I&apos;m fine in it.  By chance, do you have your foot measurements to compare?  Thanks for any info."

They also work great for tightening your valve stem lock nut, and magnetically stores 2 sets of quick links very securely. Have not used the valve core remover but seems like it will work fine. I wouldn&apos;t use them as tire levers because there medal and don&apos;t want to scratch my rims, but I knew that when I bought them. All in all, there bad ace looking and work good for what I need them for. Extra bonus as a conversation piece and just fidgeting with them when I&apos;m chilling.",

(Judge away.)\nOut of the box, these were easily the most narrow of the three. I was a bit concerned at first, but once I wore them around a couple days they&apos;d formed to my feet nicely, and I now never want to take them off. \nClassy, with or without socks. ;)\n\nI wear a 38 but most of my shoes are a size 8 or 8.5. 38s are listed as a 7-7.5, and they&apos;re slightly longer than my normal 8s. So...for me, they weirdly run small and large. This is why I&apos;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5- can be a bit tricky finding the perfect size. -At least it was for me.",

I needed this item to arrive and was pleased to see the 3-5 business day expedited shipping was free.  I placed the order on a Friday and it was saying it would arrive the following Saturday which was fine.  That would be 5 full business days.  No problem.  It took 3 days before the package was processed by DHL, but I remained hopeful as it arrived within 2 hours of the delivery address a day before the expected delivery date.  It then sat, untouched, for another nearly 2 days while under the USPS control.  Currently it won&apos;t be delivered until late Monday- over 48hrs after the predicted date.  I am sure the product will be as expected, but it will arrive too late for it&apos;s intended use.",

        "reviewBody": "The Vmax+150 Rear Light is a wonderful upgrade to the alkaline battery powered tail light that performed admirably for me until it was lost after breaking-free from my saddlebag. The Vmax+150 is compact and quite powerful compared to that predecessor rear light. In particular, I value the compact size because now there is room to position the mounting strap &amp; light below my saddlebag on the bike seat post/frame. The variety of run modes (6) is also useful for choosing the right setting when biking solo or on a group ride or during different times of the day. The mounting strap is of high quality and appears to the same for most of the NiteRider tail lights. I know this because my NiteRider Solas 30 rear light acquired nearly ten years ago came with the identical mounting strap which I&apos;ve saved and can now attach to my other bike to facilitate using the Vmax+150 on whatever set of wheels I decide to ride.",

I have a few very high end hunting packs and they always seem to cut off some hip circulation. With a 3 night off trial campsite this pack was fantastic! I was skeptical but this pack performed very well. I really liked the U-zip access, huge hip pockets, and the side pockets that I can grab a waterbottle from while wearing the pack. \nA couple of things I didn&apos;t like: those huge hip pockets left no room for a bear spray holster, there is no way for the lid to double as a separate pack for little jaunts from camp, and the hip belt was maxed tight on my 34&quot; waist in the Med/LG frame choice. I could get the waist belt tight enough but if I stopped eating cookies...",
