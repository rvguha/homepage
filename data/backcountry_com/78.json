I&apos;ve never been one to splurge on Boots, I&apos;ve always opted for the cheaper versions since I go through Boots fairly quickly but I can tell you one thing I have no regrets splurging on these. They&apos;re one of the most comfortable Boots I&apos;ve ever experienced in my life, lite as air almost feels like you&apos;re walking on clouds. I bought these for my third summit of Half Dome and the hike felt alot easier then the 2 other times I did it. Sturdy, fashionable, and lightweight, what&apos;s there not to love?! The grip on these baby&apos;s is insane and never once did I feel my feet getting hot or sweaty. \nI&apos;ll definitely be buying these boots over and over again throughout my life.",

        "reviewBody": "Loved the color and style for MTB but after 30+ years of MTB and road racing, mostly sponsored, these are the worst socks I have every worn.  I wear a US 10.5 M and the XL are nearly impossible to get on.  They are too narrow and just trying to pull them on by pinching the material between my thumb and index finger (no nails) the material just came apart on the third use.  I seriously doubt I&apos;ll get more than 2 or 3 more rides in with them.  \n\nI have at least 10 pairs of SockGuy, DeFeet and some other brands of cycling socks, some nearly 10 years old.  All &quot;Large&quot; and I&apos;ve never torn one of them just trying to put it on.  \n\nNot only can&apos;t I recommend these Castelli socks, I highly recommend you buy them only if you can get a size larger than they recommend - i.e. get XL if Castelli says you need M.  Don&apos;t even bother with them if you normally wear Large.  \n\nAll of Castelli&apos;s clothing is small.  I wear &quot;L&quot; in bibs but XL in Castelli and I just got their Perffetto Ros 2 jacket and it is amazing, but I also had to get a XL, while I&apos;ve never worn anything other than a &quot;L&quot; in tops, bibs, jackets or vests.  They make some great stuff but it&apos;s always ridiculously small, and in the case of these socks, poorly made.",

These fit the ball and they look great to boot.\n\nA little tight when first putting them on. But not as bad after washing and putting on again. I hope they get even better now that I rode for over an hour in them. If so then they are 5* and I will change the rating.\n\nShoe size 46 ordered XXL socks. Deep Green and Defender Green colors.",

I tried to put my 29.5x 2.4 tube into the bag and it wouldn’t fit.  I didn’t even try to add tire levers or cartridges.  It would be a nice bag for 700x23-34 tubes perhaps. Also it doesn’t have a place to hang a clip on light.  I’ll return the Primio for another model.  Compare my photo with the one on the website. It looks good and would be easy to clean.",

I was worried about the fraying on the edges of the fabric, I though it might look too &quot;rustic&quot; in person but definitely not the case, you don&apos;t really even notice in person (it&apos;s not too pronounced.)",

The Teva&apos;s have started to delaminate on the soul at the toes. They are not holding up at all. It&apos;s only been one month into her trip, and they are falling apart. I notified Teva, and they stated the only way she could get a new pair is to return them, well, she is backpacking through Europe and other countries and not returning, till the spring. I thought Tera would be a company that would back their product and want to support travelers and young people. I am planning to visit her at the end of summer. I was hoping I&apos;d bring her a new pair, but I will be looking to purchase something a different than a Teva since they didn&apos;t hold up to her travels and they were not supportive of their product.",

I am 5 7 and 1/2  and 130, model is 5 8 and she is wearing a regular small.  I ordered regular small based on what model was and the torso is too short!  When I raise my hands up it rides the croch.  I hope the long will work but the advertising was misleading as someone taller than me was wearing the same size as me but the torso is too short.  It is very attractive I hope that mountain hardwear will include the torso length in specs going forward and honor an exchange",

Used with Petzl Grillon to achieve an adjustable sideways anchor for detailed rope work, painting around window frames mostly, but we have aid climbed on two at a time as well.  This model grips the best as the knife edge is held in place by the directional pull and the talons hold the webbing off the wall but not too far so that they put an angular force on the edge.

        "reviewBody": "This shoe is both a hit and a miss all in one. The cushion is amazing, and that&apos;s where the good ends. I like to buy Merrell&apos;s because the insoles are removable and I can put my custom insoles in. Unfortunately, whoever designed the Agility Peak 5 for women has no idea what shape a foot is. When you remove Merrell&apos;s insole you can see that the area where the arch is is extremely narrow. While the area for the feet is extremely wide.  Due to the arch area being so narrow, my custom insoles do not lie flat when placed into the shoe. This results in the arch &quot;bump&quot; of my insoles jutting into the arch of my foot causing me pain. I have bought other insoles but no luck.  No insole is that narrow in the arch area of a foot.  Not even for women. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t realize all this before first wearing the shoes outside (so now I&apos;m stuck with them and can&apos;t return them, which is really upsetting).  I have tried wearing them with the original insole, but I need way more arch support than those insoles offer.  Also, because of the wide area for the toes it feels like my feet are swimming inside these shoes. Not what you want for a hike. So, I&apos;m extremely regretful that I didn&apos;t know beforehand that not only do I need to check if an insole is removable, but I must also check the dimensions at the very bottom of the shoe to make sure regular insoles work. To date I have worn these only once. I have no idea what I&apos;m going to do with these shoes. I&apos;m still waiting for several sets of insoles to come in in the hopes that I can jerry rig a solution to the poor dimensions of these shoes. But, every time I look at them I am just filled with regret. I got these on a 50% off discount, but it&apos;s still a lot of money to throw out and that&apos;s all I want to do with these shoes.",

Someone said it already, that the heel feels really low- I thought they&apos;d meant the cushion but it&apos;s the actual shoe part that&apos;s low, like it&apos;s somehow well below the ankle, only an inch and a half up the Achilles from the base. It feels like I&apos;m walking on TOP of a shoe, and not like my foot is safely IN a shoe. It doesn&apos;t feel secure. And the cushion is just too dang thick, I can&apos;t even tell what I&apos;m stepping on, I&apos;ve almost rolled an ankle several times. Grip is good on dry conditions but was slippery on slick rocks, not as good as I hoped/paid for. Knew they were a miss at the end of our third outing, feet were on the verge of blisters and I couldn&apos;t wait to put on different shoes that were closer to the ground and actually felt secure. Freakin moon shoes basically, bummed.",

When I took them out of the box, I thought &quot;too small&quot;... boy was I wrong. The synthetic leather stretched to fit my slightly-flat feet like a glove of love. This is a shoe that will see a lot of use on all my different bikes. Take my $!",

I will not look for anything else as I kept trying out shoes at local shops and nothing seemed to impress me until I received these. I&apos;d consider myself a Groadie as I do an equal amount gravel and road riding on my one bike, these shoes work perfect in both scenarios which typically is riding on road to get to dirt. \n\nComfortable on long mixed rides, super stiff and responsive, and clean incredibly easy. Also I have never had issues with the laces coming loose as this was one of my concerns.",

        "reviewBody": "Completely stiff, very light, ok to walk in, durable and very very comfortable.\n\nWith previous shoes (sidi dominator, specialized) I was having pretty severe foot pain from my toes smashing front of shoe when mountain biking. Pain so severe that I had to count to help ignore the pain during races. Big race was coming up and I needed to do something. Tried 5-6 different pairs in seattle area, everything that I could get my feet into and nothing was very good.\n\nOrdered 6 pairs of shoes from all over the internet in multiple sizes, every brand i could find in my size. These were the only shoes that really controlled my foot. The laces are key - the included arch support was a nice touch.\n\nI normally wear a 12.5 but have an enormous arch and can&apos;t get my feet into many boots. These shoes are simply awesome. I happily paid full msrp for the first pair. Bought a second pair when bright red was on sale at 1/2 price.\n\nAbsolutely no regrets these have been terrific. Laces are good for about 2.5 years but shoes are going strong.\n\nI am 100% singlespeed mtb, rain or shine and I don&apos;t even think about my feet any more.",

        "reviewBody": "These shoes fit the bill for a lightweight, stiff gravel/road shoe. They have a kind of cool, retro look and don&apos;t look or feel too clunky when used on the road. No issues with the laces although I did shorten them so they don&apos;t flop as much (there is an elastic keeper to hold the loose ends). The uppers do seem to break in with time. I wouldn&apos;t rate these as the coolest shoe but I can&apos;t say that my feet ever get uncomfortably warm - just that the breathability seems below average. I have narrow, low volume feet and these shoes fit beautifully with no heel slippage when walking. There is choice of three arch supports for the insoles and the shoes come with an extra set of laces. I&apos;ve only used these shoes in clean, dry conditions so I can&apos;t attest to their durability in rough, wet or muddy riding but I expect that they would cleanup and dry pretty quick. I&apos;ve only ever had to wipe them with a damp cloth.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these in last years model which are pretty much the same aside the gaiters on this year&apos;s version are a little nicer. Great pants but definitely be aware of the fit. It&apos;s great they have come out with more size options because the Ortovox size chart is often way off.  I got a size large and am 6&apos;1 and 172lbs. I also highly recommend you buy the suspenders.  I haven&apos;t seen them sold here but you can find them on Ortovox&apos;s website. No matter what outdoor activity you&apos;re planning on using these for, I highly recommend investing in the suspenders.  They are kind of pricey like all Ortovox gear (retail roughly 40 dollars) but are worth it especially if you plan on skiing or free riding etc.   these are the lightest hardshell pants I could find for my winter long distance hiking.  My only wish was they had more pockets but no matter my 3l Ortovox jacket has plenty.  I would highly recommend these to anyone who&apos;s looking for a lightweight, weather proof hardshell pant.  I do advise trying to wait and look for sales because although Ortovox gear imho is the best it can be very expensive.",

I went on 3-week trip to Japan. The luggage design is great and well-thought-out inside, but Thule decided to put in the worst luggage wheel in this carry-on, the wheel is super noisy even on smooth surfaces I have a recording of the top piece &quot; Thule SUBTERRA 2 CONVERTIBLE CARRY ON VETIVER GRAY&quot; when I put on top of the carry on will tip the whole carry on over due to poor weight distribution. It does not happen when I put it on another brand carry-on.  Thule should change the wheel to hinomoto miraclent or silent run wheel then this carry can be a 5 star rating for now it stays as 1 star.",

These are not their top of the line shorts and I expected the quality to be high but lake some of extra details. And this is the case. These are very functional and have a very comfortable Velocio pad. The reason I am giving these 4 out of 5 stars is that the wide elastic around the thighs is very snug. My thighs are fairly skinny yet these give me the sausage look as they squeeze that area. Because the leg ends are tight, pulling them on takes a little more care. I don&apos;t notice the snugness when riding. I followed the Velocio sizing guide and the overall fit (outside of the leg en being snug) is good.",

        "reviewBody": "This waist pack is perfect for me to use walking my doggie, can hold a small water bottle, fetch ball in main compartment and separate my keys, other small items in the front zipper pocket, and my cell phone in the padded back pocket. It’s a bigger pack yet light for when I need to carry something on my walk.  I especially like the loop which I could put a small biner to attach a water bowl and hat. I was picky but this has everything I am looking for.  High quality. I love the teal/orange/purple color. The only improvement is that the waist belt is long for me and I need a way to bundle them so I don’t have long dangling nylon. I used a think rubber band on each side to hold them together.",

        "reviewBody": "This is my fourth pair of Wildcats that I bought specifically to complete the John Muir Trail in CA.  I bought GTX only because they were on sale.  I wore previous pairs on Colorado Trail and Wonderland Trail, in addition to many miles of day hiking.  As typical, I sized up a full size from what I would wear for street walking, to allow toes to expand and wiggle.  I personally prefer the tougher sole and reinforced arch and heel caps to the the softer soled Altra Lone Peaks and various Hokas (I wear both brands for road running).   The Wildcats help me withstand the rocky trail, but give my feet relief compared to boots.  GTX does not breath or dry as quickly, obviously, so could take or leave it, however when hiking through shallow water and lots of snow on trail my feet tended to stay drier.  If completely submerged it will take longer to dry.  One needs to air out feet frequently on trail anyway, weather its super hot, or colder and wet, regardless of footwear.  I love these shoes.  No shoe lasts forever, though, and I have noticed in previous pairs that the rubber nubs on the sole that do very well for traction (the orange ovals) also tend to wear down rather quickly while there is otherwise a lot of wear left on the shoe.",

        "reviewBody": "Overall a good shoe. But with one MAJOR flaw, especially considering this is the Gore-Tex version: The soles are extremely slippery when wet!\nI’m quite sure footed and very comfortable crossing logs or scrambling up rocks. In the last decade I can’t say I have had any shoes that made me uncomfortable to cross logs or step onto wet rocks. This shoe did just that. Went out for a maiden backpacking trip, it rained and all of a sudden what felt like good grippy shoes were just slipping all over. Fine on dry rocks, unreliable when wet. \nAt first I thought “it must just be this rock”, but it kept happening. I slipped and feel on a small patch of wet grass, happens, but these were just next level slippery. Then I had to cross a small foot bridge, nice flat wood plank and was grateful to have trekking poles as it was a bit wet and I felt I could lose my feet from under me at any point as they were literally sliding on the wooden bridge. So disappointed. Was hoping to take it on a longe thru hike but can’t consider that anymore after this experience. Such a shame they didn’t test this properly for a waterproof shoe :/",

        "reviewBody": "I was going to purchase The Ultra Raptor II GTX, but it was never available in my size. I was looking at these as a backup and finally my size became available in these Wildcats. I was looking for a good Gortex trail runner to keep my feet dry. These felt great right out of the box. Ten minutes into my run they felt like butter on my feet. Stable, well cushioned, good traction, responsive and kept my feet nice and dry. They pretty much check all the boxes. I only do shorter runs, 3-6 miles, but I do go out almost everyday and I&apos;ve only had them for a couple weeks, so we&apos;ll see how durable they are. Some people have complained about the traction, but I&apos;ve had them on wet roots and rocks without any issues. The only negative I can think of is availability, but that has nothing to do with the shoes. Everything has supply chain issues right now, so I can&apos;t really fault La Sportiva for that. Bottom line is, these are great shoes.",

The soles last a long time, they have great support, are actually waterproof, and are stiff enough to give great edging in off trail side-hill scrambling. They are not perfect however, and they consistently have had 3 problems.\r\n 1. For waterproof shoes they do not grip well at all on wet rocks or wood. \r\n 2. Invariably, well before the shoes show any wear anywhere else, the linings of the heels get worn through.\r\n 3. Several pairs have had lace loops break through and are irreparable, which is odd because the simple woven nylon lace loops on my several pairs of non GTX version never wear out here.\r\nBut in the end I like these shoes well enough to keep buying them. Though I do wish these problem areas would be fixed.",

I have read it?s slippery on wet smooth surfaces like concrete, but I live in a dry climate and only use it on trails.\n\nThe waterproofing is excellent and keeps me totally dry on stream crossings (though it?s got a low ankle so watch your depth).\n\nPS size up",

I knew that the soles were slick, but they turned out to be dangerously so.  \r\n\r\nI&apos;m fairly use to the slipperiness of rocks in streams.  Still, I was pretty shocked at how slick these shoes were while trying to balance on a rock during a recent stream crossing.  I made it across to a large, flat rock, turned slightly and it was like I was standing on ice.  My feet went out from under me, landed in freezing cold water, soaking my lower body, lost a trekking pole and very easily could have broken a wrist or something.\r\n\r\nIf you ONLY, ONLY, ONLY plan on hiking or running in dry environments, I guess this shoe would be good for you.  I&apos;ve seriously almost slipped in city when it was raining.  The soles are THAT BAD.  Which is too bad.  I really want to like this show.",

I&apos;ve had the same MSR Pocket Rocket since 2007 that stove has held its own for years in all conditions, I should have just rolled with the old MSR stove.",

We did the 4 season which there is no picture for.  The tank attaches by a metal tube, included in the package.  This allows you to do a liquid feed on super cold days and tank up for everything else.  It is not efficient, more of a real fast boiling flame thrower that uses a quarter of a 400g can of fuel every time you boil something.  You can regulate it down to a simmer with a little work and it is very solid.  Even fairly large pots sit on it nicely, two and three liter is what we tried and it was nice!  We bought a second one which at 80 bucks, says it all.  It is worth the luxury 5 ounce weight and the flame is nice and smooth.  What a great product for anyone who wants a stove that will work perfectly all the time.  PS:  No wind guard was purchased.  In high wind it stayed lit and heated 2 liters of water to a boil at 7,000 feet in about 15 minutes with a half a can of fuel.  Gets the job done every time!",

However, the zipper garage is either defective on the one I got or poorly designed. In order to pull the zipper up the last inch, I have to manually pull apart the layers of the garage, force the zipper into it, then rearrange the layers around it. I&apos;ve never had this issue with a zipper garage before, including on other wool sweaters, and it&apos;s way too high maintenance, even at the sale price.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this a month ago, needed a waterproof running vest for solo long distance self supported run in Scotland. The size of the waterproof main compartment is good, and it is good to have the elastic on outside but this bag is very limited in function, they have used to much waterproof fabric for the other pockets making things slide around too easily. Full 500ml soft bottles are difficult to get in the pockets (especially if re-filling water on the go) and are positioned a little too low. I like having a waterproof zip pocket on the front but think this vest would be much better if it the same design as the other adv skin vests with much more stretchy fabric and simply have a waterproof main compartment. I have tested this on a number of longer fell runs (around 30km). It is a good size for what I need but I am disappointed that the design doesn’t seem to work as well as the other vests (difficult to reach the side pockets whilst wearing). I didn’t mind not getting soft bottles as I already have plenty of them.",

Just a little slop in the vest with the added load capacity + filled soft flasks can provide a lot of unwanted movement. This is a great high performance addition to your gear; ex. race day pack or weekend run pack. I would not recommend for a daily; ex running to work or grocery shopping run. For this i use something more user friendly with Buckles around chest and velcro on top storage area instead of chest pull cords. (pull cords do feel better)",

I purchased the Safe Tech Trad Harness in a large, as per the measurement guide, and it&apos;s way too big. I&apos;m synching it down with nothing to spare and it&apos;s not quite tight enough. I wanted it to work so bad I didn&apos;t exchange it. I knew the gear loops would be too far back in a medium. I ordered the Misty Mountain Turbo in a Large and it fits perfectly. It has a three inch gap between the two ends. 0-3 inches is the stated &quot;perfect fit&quot;. I think something is wrong with the Metolius, it&apos;s fits exactly like a XL with the gear loops to far back.\nMy pants size is 33 and my waist measures 35.5",

Hope this was fully proven.  Also, considering the price paid, I expected locks to come with the rack.  My old racks are still useable but the shocks need replacement and the plastic head on the adjustment screws broke long ago.  Unit is pricey but it does last, easy to use.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;m 5&apos;2&quot; with a 60 lb kayak and a tall vehicle. I hesitated in getting the hullavator for a couple.years because it&apos;s pricy and for me it would require an upgrade if my cross bars. Well I finally bit the bullet and made the purchase, \r\n\r\nI went with the square bars and even though the 139 was recommended on the site, based on my vehicle, I ordered the 150 because the hullavator needs 4 to 8 inches of overhang past the foot where it attaches to your vehicle side rails.\r\nThe whole set up was easy to install myself. It didn&apos;t take long at all and I went slow to be sure to do it all to specifications.\r\n\r\nI could not be happier with the purchase as it means I can easily dash out for a paddle when the mood and the weather strikes without waiting on someone else to help me load and unload. \r\nIf transport is your biggest barrier to getting on the water then just get the hullavator.\r\n\r\nI do have one complaint and it&apos;s more of an annoyance than anything. I had to search extensively to figure out if the racks and the hullavator came with a key to secure things. It appeared that the racks did but the hullavator did not  so I went ahead and just ordered a 2 key set of the Thule one key (which was also hard to find on this site)\r\nWell I wish I would have gotten the 6 key set as the racks only came with a plastic toggle.\r\nPlease Thule update your product descriptions to include whether or not your product includes a key lock (especially when your install directions imply that they do but they don&apos;t). It was disappointing to spend this much money and now still have to order extra bits and pieces. It would be a simple fix on your end.",

After waiting a week for the package to arrive I opened it up and seriously laughed at how small the shorts are.  They can fit someone in elementary school.  So bummed that now I have to return them, UGH.",

I am giving 3 stars because the material is awesome.  I have crashed in them (my old POC&apos;s) and it averted road rash, but they are also so stretchy and never too hot for me.

My first instinct was to trade in for a medium because they were a tiny bit baggy, but I&apos;ll hold onto them and see after a ride.  They have a velcro thing on the back so you can tighten the waist if you need to. I had to tighten it a little bit. These will look super good with knee pads. They&apos;re nice and king with two zip pockets in the front.",

These shoes come in a wide size - great for fitting over his AFO - and the BOA system works really well, though ours son has a hard time easily reaching the dial on his affected side. The only real problem I have with them is that, because they are meant to be trail shoes, the soles are bulky and make the shoes heavy, so our guy can’t run as well. We tried the Dynasoft Reveal style, but the plastic cover on top gapped on his AFO and didn’t seem to fit right, not to mention the lack of breatheability was a concern. Hoping New Balance can solve these issues for the next season!",

        "reviewBody": "Best mug ever! As someone who spends the entire year outside guiding tours I will definitely say I start everyday with a hot beverage, coffee or yerba mate. This mug keeps my drinks ripping hot for a very long time. As guide, I can have a few sips before tour and come back for a few more HOT sips before the next tour... love that. For me, I prefer the 12oz size, anything larger is more than I need, definitely holds enough for the perfect cup of coffee. Easy to drink from, comfortable in hand. Tough design that can handle a lot of action and outdoor life. It will leak a little bit if you hold it upside down above your head or throw it against the tree it will leak so if you are looking for a sippy cup for adults, this is not it. Great looking design, simple. Follows the high quality tradition of Camelbak products. I&apos;ve been a customer since late &apos;90s and that won&apos;t be changing anytime soon! Bring it to your local coffee shop and reduce waste.",

I think the sip cap is easy to use and extends the length of time your liquid stays hot. Outdoor mornings are so much nicer with this ultimate camp mug that you&apos;ll probably end up using it everyday like I do. Pretty much the awesomeness you&apos;d expect from Camelbak.

I figured if I need better control of the crampon, I could use the trailing hole on the side of the crampon to tie over the boot. This boot overhangs 3 inches per side. Of course I also purchased the large center bar. This is not for technical activity. I have a trip in January to Svalbard. Average temperature then is -40 C which is also -40 F.  Polar bears to people are 2 to 1. From what I researched, boot mfg and ice traction mfg don&apos;t talk to one another. Each one is in their own little world and the other one doesn&apos;t exist. I would have gone for the Contact model except it doesn&apos;t have the additional side holes.  The mandatory questions in this review are irrelevant to my quest",

It is the first shoe where I’ve ever had to stop and do that. Also, the waterproof material feels more ‘plasticy’ in comparison to the regular. They have a different look. I’m not a big fan of what they’ve done with the waterproof lines.",

It&apos;s obviously made from strong materials, but with a shovel and probe inside there&apos;s not a lot of storage space left. It&apos;s and ideal half day pack - maybe day - but recommended for those who are looking to carry light. The cartridge airbag system is also not the easiest to test prior to using. You essentially have to blow through 2 $50 cartridges, which can be difficult to find on the internet.",

        "reviewBody": "What good is an avy air bag if it sits in your tack room most of the time? BD has (at last count) three different deployment systems. This is likely the most expensive &quot;per pull&quot;, but is the lightest and most comfortable of all the options that they offer. The dual cartridge system is easy to arm, i.e. connect the dual cartridges and secure the pull cable anchor in the shoulder strap harness. Plenty roomy for day trips in the heart of Colorado winter, this pack can also be stripped down for side country laps. The diagonal carry system is BD proven for all width of skis but may be awkward with split boards. There are three operable zippers on the exterior/top (not including the deployment zipper), one of which is used for the &quot;goggle&quot; pocket, another to stow the upper ski carry strap and the third for the main compartment. One minor niggle is that two of the zippers have identical black webbing pulls and the third has gray webbing; one would think that the designers would have specified a third color/shade so that each pull had it&apos;s only color scheme, but this is easy to rectify.\r\nThe main pocket has a zippered mesh pocket for small items, and a sleeved compartment for shovel, probe and saw. I use a K2 Recon &quot;hoe&quot; style shovel which fits perfectly and a BCA probe set. My BCA snow saw will also fit if its a study day. Everything is easy to grab and go.\r\nIn addition to simple operation, this pack is the best fitting pack out of six BD packs that I have owned. It&apos;s weird, like it was designed for me, incredible freedom of movement and close fit with no slop even when I endo (it happens). I am short-torso and orangutan limbs that drag in the skin track (sic).\r\nNow, many might suggest that this deployment system is passe, a dead end in avy air bag evolution. Given the five to ten year operational life of an airbag pack and wide adoption of the twin cartridge system, I doubt that will be a problem. I bought this for the Home Crag and road tripping, not for air travel: for the latter, I will likely rent an airbag from a reliable outfitter. Again, that&apos;s my bias.\r\nAll in all, I would buy this again and would recommend it for its reliability and great fit.",

I love the durability of these bladders for bikepacking, but absolutely hate the smell. I wish Hydrapak would just admit issue with their product composition. But for an American corporations, that would mean putting consumers ahead of profits. It is more likely you could get pigs to fly.

Material seemed very strong.  The only thing keeping it from five stars is that the bag imparted and extremely strong plastic taste to the water.  It seemed to get stronger throughout the week instead of milder.  It made it difficult to enjoy my coffee and dehydrated meals.  I’m really hoping this subsides since this is such a great water carrier.",

          "We are sorry you are experiencing a bad taste with your product. As a leading provider of performance hydration, any issue with our product is taken seriously. Our products are made from a food-grade Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) material. We have used this material since 2001 and it is used by many of our competitors. It is the industry standard because of its food-safe properties and its durability.\n\nTPU is safe, reliable and non toxic. It’s 100% BPA and PVC free: every one of our products meets or exceeds the most rigorous national food safety standards in the world. Unfortunately, a small percentage of flask and reservoir users can experience an unpleasant taste, which varies from person to person. Please try to following to reduce the taste issue:\n\n1) Fill the container up with water and add a few drops of lemon juice (about 1 teaspoon). Then place into your freezer and let it freeze overnight. Take the frozen container out of the freezer and let it thaw completely. Dump out lemon juice water and then rinse. The taste should be diminished.\n\n2 ) Alternatively, you can fill the container up with milk (powdered milk works for this as well) and place it into the refrigerator for 24 hours. Then completely clean and dry the container. \n\n3) You can also use a Bottle Bright tablet and soak it with warm water for 30+ minutes. Then empty and rinse the reservoir or container, scrubbing it with a bristle brush. Rinse once more, completely and let dry fully prior to using.\n\n4) For those that are extra sensitive to taste, we recommend using a Nuun tablet or a drop or two of lemon juice in their reservoir or container during activity. \n\nIf these solutions do not work for you, please let us know"

I used the Seeker to refill the water bottle.  The Seeker is durable, as I had it on my back, in the dirt, sitting on pine cones, and with no issues.  Three challenges: 1. The bladder is flimsy and when you put the top on you have to be careful water doesn&apos;t pour out. 2. refilling the water bottles is tricky at first (again due to the flimsy nature). 3.  Heavy when full and challenging to find a spot on the pack to store.  That said, I would recommend this to anyone who needs a larger water capacity.  If you have more pockets perhaps a 1.5L or 2L will be easier to distribute the weight.",

I intended to do mostly hiking and some scrambling (no rope climbing) and planned to just wear hiking shoes. I decided to order and give these a try and WOW these are the shoes I didn&apos;t know I needed! They are sturdy and perform similar to your typical climbing shoe but are comfortable to walk in all day. These made me feel very confident while scrambling. Definitely a smaller fit and I would recommend sizing up a full size. I&apos;m usually an 8.5/9 and ordered the 9.5, glad I did. They are snug but comfortable. My new go-to shoe for adventuring - would HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for something that performs better than hiking shoes.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had this sun hoody for 1 year now, and these are my thoughts:\n\nPros: The material is sooo soft and comfortable. It offers good stretch, hasn&apos;t snagged or torn, and is generally just nice to wear.\nCons: The fit is just off. For me, the hoody is about 6&quot; too long, and the drawstring just ends up between my legs when I&apos;m walking (and is one extra hurdle to overcome when you have to water a tree, if you know what I mean). The hood is large enough to wear over a helmet, but is too large and constantly falls down if I&apos;m not wearing a helmet. The hood also offers zero front neck coverage.\n\nMove the drawstring from the bottom to the hood, shorten the garment a bit, and add a little front neck coverage and this would be an awesome hoody. However, as it is now I tend to reach for the other sun hoodies in my closet.",

I like the length as my low back or belly will not be exposed when I&apos;m casting when fly fishing. Some women&apos;s tops fit everywhere but are tight across my upper back. The CLH, sz lrg, fits me perfectly. I don&apos;t like tops that are really tight. I have a little armpit room and a little bit of room to let the breeze flow through. I am 5&apos;7&quot;, 158#, 38A chest, and 43&quot; hips. I would have liked some different patterns and colors, but that&apos;s just a personal preference. I am very happy that there have been multiple colors of green. I typically think that men&apos;s outdoor tops have better color choices than women&apos;s but I think the CLH, overall, has been pretty good. Like others have written, the ties are annoying and the little pocket doesn&apos;t appear useful, but the ties can easily be trimmed off and I just forget about the pocket. The colors of the CLH&apos;s are accurate on the website. I highly recommend the CLH!!",

For doing my warm weather outdoor activities, these are the best of the different brands of hoodies that I have. I am 5&apos;7&quot;, 158#, chest 38A, hips 43&quot; and the sz lrg fits me perfectly. I find that some tops are tight in the back across my shoulders and I have no problem here. I&apos;m not in love with the current patterns of the CLH, but that&apos;s just an opinion.

Also came with a smaller nose piece to further fine tune the glasses.  The locking design is really smart and probably the nicest paid of Oakley&apos;s I own (this is my ninth pair).",

        "reviewBody": "I have used the Jawbreakers for a few years now and love them for mountain biking. I have the mountain bike and road bike lenses and typically use the mountain bike lens because they are so go in low light and still do well with the sun. The glasses have great coverage and keep any dirt, mud, water out of the eyes. Lens are very clear and have great coverage, but they are Oakley lenses, which are some of the best in the market but scratch easily. The glasses cover the full face and have a really good fit with adjustable arms. Lens swap system is easy and holds lens in securely. The frames are light weight and don&apos;t have the feel of much dexterity, but I have battle tested these and have had no issues with broken parts. They have great ventilation and don&apos;t fog up at all when on the move. I would highly recommend for Mountain Biking as the best on the market. \n\nI have recently started using for splitboarding with mixed results. When climbing, they fog up because you aren&apos;t going fast enough for the air to flow and clear the fog. That is true with all sunglasses I have tried though, as when sweat gets on the lens in cold weather, fog in inevitable. I still use these for skinning as the best option if have found. I have tried on the downhill a few times but when it&apos;s cold, the airflow freezes the eyes a bit so they are a no-go. These aren&apos;t intended for snow sports but just though I would share my experience.",

Customer service was great to apologize and send out another pair next day. Second pair was  two different size shoes. One new one  correct size and the other one was a different size smaller was used and not only indoors.  Specifically told customer service that I wanted a return to my credit card and they gave me store credit. Had to contact again and fixed the situation.  To say a bit disappointed in Backcountry is an understatement!",

As an example, my size 44 Time shoes are pretty much the same as my size 11 running shoes.  However, I needed a size 45.5 in the Specialized Ares to fit.  It took me two pairs to figure out the sizing.  My recommendation is to measure the insoles of a pair of shoes that fit and then find the same measurement in these.",

Even though the length of the shoe was great I felt my feet too tight in the shoe and uncomfortable. I never wear wide shoes and all my sneakers fit great so I do not know why this shoe is so tight. I hope if fit me well because for the sale price of 220 is unbeatable shoe.",

I have never had to wear &quot;wide&quot; shoes, but these shoes made me feel like I must have monster feet. A few miles into their inaugural ride, I entirely loosened the front BOA to reduce the pressure on the front of my feet. Nevertheless, by the end of that ~60 mile ride, my left foot was swollen and numb for close to a week. For the price, I would expect at least a more accurate sizing chart.

The closure system felt great all along the tops of my feet and the length was perfect. Snug to get on with the sock liner but very secure once on. I had to return them though, because they were just a bit too narrow along the bone on the outside of my feet from heel to small toe. That side of my feet got very sore by the end of the ride. My feet measure 105 mm wide and 280 mm long using the Lake Shoe measuring system. I ordered 44.5 based on their chart. If you have narrower feet than I do these could be tremendous shoes, but they were too narrow for me.",

That would be great, but they are also excellent fitting and provide high performance. You don&apos;t need to tighten them much... just snugging them down gives excellent feel and control. \n\nThe &quot;not perfect&quot; comes from the sock liner. I have the white shoes, and the liner (particularly at the instep) turned grey very quickly from dirt, and doesn&apos;t seem to be cleanable. The rest of the shoe looks great, but the liner... not so much. I&apos;m still seeking a way to clean them.",

        "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that I&apos;m a long time fan of S-works shoes. I currently rotate through the Sub6 (lace up), Exos (one BOA dial) and now these which are by far the most comfortable. On the hottest days here in Texas, there is no beating the Exos and for style, the Sub6 hit the mark. But these Ares are SOOOOO stinkin&apos; comfortable that I choose them most often. There is also some magic with the stiffer sole that makes them feel super connected to the pedal; like every watt is getting transmitted directly to the pedal. I love the new BOA dials that you can turn to tighten or loosen one micro notch at a time or pop them up to instantly get them off your feet. \nOne note on the size: I always wear a 45 in S-Works shoes and these seam just a hair larger than the other, but still fit fine. Maybe if you&apos;re in between sizes then size down. \nI agree with other reviewers that the looks are funky, BUT...I don&apos;t care. I&apos;ll take function over form in this situation. \nThe cost is a little embarrassing to admit to anyone so I gloss over that bit when people ask, but I&apos;ll wear holes in my kit, wear out my chain and use no name water bottles to put extra money towards shoes like this.",

Given that &quot;comfortable&quot; in this context is a rather relative term, I must agree: I have ridden about 600 miles in the shoes and I like them very much. The wide toe cage is a major plus for me and the fit is spot on. The double BOA system is great and allows minute adjustments. So far the have aged very well.",

I&apos;m excited about using this on the trail as my headlamp I carry on all of my day hiking trips and especially on backpacking trips. It is lightweight, compact and has a powerful beam that is dimmable. Having a red light option and the ability to lock the light in the off position were selling points for me as well.

These are really versatile- you can wear them with sneakers for a hike, or dress them up for work, with cute boots and a nice top. I only wish the fabric was a bit thicker. I&apos;ve only washed and worn them a couple of times (still good), but I can&apos;t imagine them having much longevity.",

Right out of the packaging I was amazed at how well they fit, the light but stretchy material, and the pockets. I have gone rock climbing in these pants twice for each pair. The first pair has pilling on the butt where the back straps of my harness were moving along the fabric. My second pair has a hope ripped in the inner leg (which I have already sent a claim to MH for a repair) but also has pilling in the front crotch area from where my harness had rubbed. I bought a 3rd pair of the full length pants to use for hiking and I am so worried about the inner thigh pilling I will experience after wearing them and hiking. My pants look like they’ve been used for years and they’ve only been worn twice. Please please use better fabric, more durable. Mountain Hardware clothing should stand up to hard wear, not be this delicate!",

The hi rise is low enough to be comfortable and keep the pants from slipping down, even when I&apos;m most active--and the overall stretch makes every activity easy.  Just right for me--i would trade all my other summer pants for some more of these!",

Why? Because they have TWO functional front zip pockets (instead of one small one) -- which are big enough for keys and a cell phone and even an Epipen! Wish I could trade now! The waist is still comfortable, though a bit higher.  I love them!!",

So I decided to try this one and so far so good SMP saddles are by far the best design in my opinion, but set up is tricky. You really have to fidget so plan on that if you’re getting one and generally speaking, it seems like you need to run them farther forward than you would think especially if you measure. what I like about this saddle is it’s more padded than the pro line so it’s good for a rider who is now riding one hour a day versus the four and five I used to do .",

        "reviewBody": "I bought my first pair of Loyaks about 5 years ago for kayaking but didn’t like my feet being soggy so stuck with flip flops. After spending too much money on Sperry’s, Helly Hanson, Addidas over the years for sailing shoes that all lost their grip after a few months of wear, I used my old Loyaks for the past two months of sailing on our new boat. I was confident in their grip on wet (and dry!) decks, I could feel the deck level anchor controls with my toes, my shoes didn’t get caught in lines as I stepped over them, no pain or damage to my toes when I kicked deck hardware by mistake, no pressure on my bunion, I felt like an eight year old climbing on railings, no sweaty feet, I can wear them with or without socks and it’s really like being barefoot but with protection! I just purchased the all weather Loyaks for myself and a pair of the originals for my husband for Christmas. I’ve always liked Astral, now I LOVE Astral! Thanks for making a great functional and attractive shoe!",

Due to heavy use, I eventually wear through the soles of each pair, but apart from that natural wear and some sun fading, they look and function as well on their retirement day as on day one. I rinse them off with clean water at the end of each day, and that has kept them from getting any funky smells. I also receive compliments on them regularly. Water shoes that function perfectly AND get compliments? Pretty rare.",

The mesh compartment just displaces room you could use if it wasn’t there - why do you need to separate your clothes? I used it for a 2week Italy trip and didn’t over pack but this seemed awkward every time I zipped it shut. Why do you need split level? Straps?? Weird. Rolled nicely on the big wheels but again those were overkill. It could use over snow wheels… that’d be something!",

        "reviewBody": "This has been an outstanding carry on roller bag.  The main compartment has a split design.  One side has compression straps and the other has a full length zippered mesh cover.  On an 11 day trip to Europe I packed dress shoes, toiletry kit, fleece full zip jacket and other items in the open side.  I used the side with the zippered mesh cover as a large built-in packing cube.  This is where I packed all of my clothing including four pairs of lightweight pants, four long sleeve shirts, undershirts and folded sport coat in the side with the mesh cover.  On the front there is a sleeve for a laptop which fit my 13&quot; no problem.  I did not need to use the expansion capability, but it was peace of mind to have it and not need it.\n\nThe large caster style wheels worked well for rolling over cobblestone streets and sidewalks.  I bought the black Vx21 version and it proved to be water proof.  It rained during the trip, and while the outside got very wet, everything inside was dry.  The size was just right for easily fitting into airplane overhead bins and it did not take up too much space on the trains and subways.\n\nOne item that should be obvious is that due to the split design it can be awkward to access the main areas while on a hotel luggage rack. It&apos;s the one trade off of the split design vs clamshell luggage, but I prefer the built-in organization of the split design.  All in all I&apos;m very happy with this purchase!",

I love that it’s made of cotton instead of sweaty synthetic. A small flaw is the front pocket flap absolutely refuses to lay flat so I used a seam ripper and removed it. It’s a tough, comfortable suit and it washes and dries great.",

It is one size fits all, and while I forced adjustment with the plastic connector at back and succeeded in making the band size smaller, the body of the cap itself is still a bit too large, so it bags a bit and since it is short, it rides up on my head unless I anchor it with a ponytail.

They are supposed to be tight so I think I&apos;ll need to find some lighter-weight socks. Excited to continue trying these out on upcoming adventures.",

I matched the soles of the new version to the old version (both are size 40) and La Sportiva has cut 1/3 to 1/2 inch off the width. So these will only fit narrow width feet now. I am not going to order the next size up because that is not going to fix how narrow these shoes are. Since I am an ordinary mortal, I will be looking for a different brand of approach shoes.",

They smeared nicely on the rock and were more supportive than I thought they would be since the upper is like a stretchy sock.The fit is fairly close to my TX4&apos;s which I love, but these are more breathable. The sole is flat with no raised heel unlike the TX4&apos;s, but it didn&apos;t make much of a difference in performance.  I did go up a half size from my TX4&apos;s.
