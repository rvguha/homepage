My friend and I thought the bus was the perfect option for our day trip needs! We especially appreciated the snacks on the bus ride, movie on the way back, ability to drop off items on the bus (so that we didn't have to carry them the whole day) and having a rest stop on the way there. A couple of suggestions: 1) it appeared that the bus driver and tour guide were not quite on the same page with the itinerary and number of stops, so it would be nice if this were more clear to everyone, including riders, upfront. 2) Although we sincerely appreciated the spirit and cheer of the tour guide, I think that cutting the long list of cheesy jokes and swapping them out for an additional movie (for the way there) would be more enjoyable for everyone on the trip."

The pier was fairly easy for everyone to find. Parking was right across the street. The boat ride was not too long but not too short. We enjoyed the captains announcements and information about the area. The greeting of hot mugs of Muscles just off the boat was fun. The buffet was delicious. They had headsets with Mandarin interpretation for the performance which we found informative and not too long. My volunteers went on a hike down the beach, which was easily accessible. I thought the gift shop was nice. wide enough isles were helpful. I wish we had another hour on the island. I also thought it would have been nice to know if the local Native Americans were directly benefiting from the proceeds of the trip."

The boat was large, squeaky clean with an outstanding crew and an excellent tour director (Kelly). They provided an informative narrative of the key sites and history of Puget Sound on the way to Blake Island and pointed out several sea otters and seals on the way as well. Upon arrival, they served a wonderful clam broth with several of those tasty shellfish before entering the longhouse for a delicious salmon dinner. Following dinner the local PNW Native American tribe members put on an educational show of song and dance depicting their culture and the stories of their past. The return trip had wonderful views of the Seattle landscape and luckily Mt. Ranier which is not always visible. \nAll in all, a great day thanks to Argosy and the Native American folks."

They were very attentive and made sure that we had drinks, food, and we’re comfortable. The whole trip was very seamless and I highly recommend it."

The process of boarding, border control etc was all fine. Staff courteous and professional. The Clipper V Boat was clean, tidy and comfortable. The booking conditions are clear, its non refundable if boat cannot go out in bad weather, that's the chance you take booking in advance.  Its a 3 hour trip and the scenery is tremendous.  Not cheap but a really good day out; a great opportunity to sample a bit of Canada."

        "reviewBody": "Approximately one month ago, my mother and I embarked on a trip to Victoria, BC for a weekend getaway, only to find ourselves abandoned by the FRS Clipper. Despite the enjoyable time spent in Victoria itself, the entire experience was ruined by the utter failure of the FRS Clipper team to communicate effectively and take responsibility for stranding us. The night before our scheduled return, our hotel displayed a Victoria Clipper advisory indicating a sailing advisory was in effect. The concierge vaguely mentioned technical issues without providing further details, raising immediate concerns. We hoped these would be resolved by morning.\n\nRegrettably, they were not. At 9:30 AM, hours before our scheduled 6 PM departure, my mother received an email (which apparently not all passengers received) informing us that our return trip was canceled. Shockingly, the email offered no alternatives for getting back to Seattle, focusing solely on only refunding the boat fare. Consequently, our final vacation day was consumed by stress and wasted time as we scrambled to find a way home. We even had a high-tea reservation at the Empress that was also tainted, since we spent the entire hour looking at viable options to get home.\n\nUltimately, the most direct and less time consuming option we found was an $800 flight back to Seattle, plus the additional expense of an Uber to reach Victoria Airport. Upon our return, our attempts to engage with FRS Clipper for empathy or accountability were met with further disappointment. The company showed no willingness to reimburse us or any other affected customers for the substantial extra costs incurred due to their cancellation. Had the initial email from the Clipper provided viable return options (such as bus routes, ferry alternatives, etc.), we could have salvaged the remainder of our trip and adjusted our plans accordingly. Once again, the flagrant lack of accountability, communication, and customer service displayed by this company was utterly disgraceful.\n\nWhile Victoria remains a charming destination, I strongly advise exploring alternative travel methods such as driving, or carefully considering other routes. Otherwise, you risk being stranded and forced to shell out hundreds of dollars unexpectedly—funds that could have been better spent elsewhere."

Because we had such a small group, perhaps we could have been given more time at Pioneer Square.  We had about five minutes inside the Glasshouse Studio, then we had to walk quickly to the Klondike in order to use their restrooms, public restrooms which Lance assured us were clean.  (They were.)  That took the entire 15 minutes, so we had to rush back to the bus.  No other stops were rushed.\n\nThe tour showed us Pike Street Market, downtown, a working marina, the Fish Ladder at Chittendam Locks, Ballard, lots of architecture, lots of foliage, a real estate tour of Queens-something, some vista points, etc.  \n\nAs promised, we were given two hours on our own at Pike Street Market.  Based on Lance's recommendation (just one of many), Maximillan's sounded good.  However, we were seated with my back to the window, at a small two-top.  There was little atmosphere.  What there was was snooty.  Nothing on the menu struck our fancy, so we left and had lunch at Lowell's.  It was, for us, a much better option.  One couple did dine at Maximillan's.  The third couple, like us, were seated, reviewed the menu and left.  \n\nAs part of the tour, we were given reusable grocery bags and discount coupons, as well as a map of Seattle.  We used one of the discount coupons at Confectional.  The coupons are nice but would be nicer if more information were provided on each coupon -- What is this for?  Something free?  Dollars off?  What?  Which item?\n\nThe tour was scheduled for five hours.  It may have run longer.  We were to be dropped at the Space Needle.  Lance gave each of us a pre-paid ticket to the Space Needle.  By then, we were ready for a nap, so Lance dropped us at our downtown hotel.\n\nThe 'coach' was very comfortable.\n\nThere is a sign that says tips are appreciated.  That's fine.  BUT the sign suggests 10 - 20% of the ticket price.  We paid $300 for the two of us.  A 20% tip would be another $60.  I think that's a VERY BIG tip; after all, a tip is extra income to the Tour Guide, it's not his salary.  We tipped 10%, or $30.\n\nI highly recommend this tour.  I suggest you do it on your first day.  It'l help you decide how you want to spend the remainder of your visit, what places you want to return to, etc."

The tour involves:\n* A guided bus and walking tour of the factory, including viewing a number of aircraft assembly lines\n* The visitor centre, including a museum, airport viewing platform and shop\n\nIf you can make your own way to Everitt, the price is under USD$30. A number of operators provide tours from Seattle. In my case, I used Tours Northwest . The driver and guide was an ex-Boeing employee and provided a very knowledgeable commentary of our trip up from Seattle and background before we took the Boeing tour itself."

Although the tour is all about Boeing and Boeing has their own employees to lead the tour, our tour guide shared a lot of interesting details about Seattle, like tour tips, dining, history, culture, housing prices and so on. He also offered to drop us to places we would like to be after the tour and gave us extra tips about exploring the places we got off. As for the Boeing tour, I think the tour didn’t give us enough time to explore things and ask questions. We just went up to the 4 viewing points on the top floor and looked at people working on parts of planes while the Boeing employee gave a very brief introduction of what they were doing. You are not allowed to take your phone in there so no pictures inside. There is a small exhibition in the lobby of the factory tour which is interesting. You can design your own plane and test fly it. You can also fly with a lead bird and learn about how birds are flying. This exhibition is worth a look."

Our driver was interesting and spoke to us about the history of Boeing on the way. There were no safety belts on our mini coach and I felt uncomfortable travelling at speed on the freeway-I was surprised that this was allowed in the USA.  At Boeing it was quiet and we had a coffee before putting ALL our belongings in a locker.  A coach takes you to the building and you are shown to 2 areas in a group where you can watch the planes being assembled. It was very interesting but you spend much less time there than I expected.  The tour itself does take 90 minutes but you only spend about 30minutes actually watching the plane assembly areas.  It is really fascinating if you like planes and I am glad that we went, but I did expect to spend more time actually seeing the planes and less time being driven and walked about."

Ken was an excellent tour guide and gave in-depth information on the sights and sounds of Seattle in the surrounding cities. \n\nOn the downside, I feel that the company can do a better job at identifying areas for breaks and/or creating a different schedule that allows more time at the Space Needle.  There was a couple stops and at least one neighborhood that could have, in my opinion, been skipped. This coupled with trimming maybe 30 minutes off Pikes Place Market would allow about an hour for the Space Needle. \n\n Even if the price were increased, THAT would make this the perfect tour."

Mark , our tour guide went above and beyond stopping at beautiful must see spots  and offered to take pictures of every passenger who wanted to capture the moments. We accomplished so much and were able to visit multiple hiking trails, historical rivers and water falls like Ohanapecosh and historical trees that are hundreds of years old. We also had the opportunity to stop by for ice-cream at Elbe Market for the famous huckleberry ice-cream. Best experience ever! 10/10 recommend!"

We saw parts of the old mountain forest. Matthew was able to bring the Forest to life for us with his expertise and knowledge. He was able to provide the history about the area as well about the current plants, trees and animals.  He showed us variety of berries, flowers, mushrooms, birds and chipmunks. He showed off the old hot springs and rust springs (from the iron in the water).  Very entertaining, very inclusive, providing great enjoyment for our whole group.  I would defiantly recommend any tour with Evergreen Escapes and especially Matthew as your guide.  I would give him six stars instead of five he was that good and knowledgeable. My wife and I went on three different trips while we were visiting Seattle and his Mt Rainier guided tour was the best of our trips by far.  If you want a great tour, I would pick Evergreen Escapes they have great guides. Hopefully you will get on a tour with Matthew as your guide and you will learn a lot.\nHe went out of his way to try to get us a good picture of the summit which was hiding in the clouds the day we went.  But by the end of the day, we finally got that whole Mt Rainier picture. The clouds cleared and we got some good pictures. They provided coffee, tea and water. Great snacks, a good lunch and good deserts. We started off with French pressed coffee and flavored bread. Our whole group enjoyed the tour. My Wife and I really had fun and think anyone booking this will have fun too. Six Stars (I guess I can live with 5 stars). We even got some pictures of the wild Elk.  I would defiantly recommend this tour."

Everyone gets a window seat on this flightseeing tour over Seattle’s waterfront areas that provides you with aerial views of the Space Needle, Lake Union, professional sports stadiums and the downtown skyline. Listen to music and recorded commentary about the city, and end with a picture perfect water landing in the heart of the city.",

It left from Lake Union in downtown Seattle and landed in Victoria Harbor.  \n\nBoarding was simple.  The only unexpected thing was the weight restrictions on luggage.  I had a roller board and a backpack (37 lbs)  they charge $1 per pound over 25lbs.\n\nThe trip took 40 minutes and the views were awesome.  I would totally do it again."

        "reviewBody": "I bought my other half a gift voucher with Kenmore Air for Christmas 2021, because we were spending the holiday with our family in Seattle.  Unfortunately snow stopped play and we couldn't take advantage of the voucher; but Kenmore honour their vouchers, which never go out of date, so we were able to use it on our second trip this spring.\n\nWe did originally book to fly back from San Juan Island but, again, the weather was against us and, although Kenmore were happy to transfer us to a standard, rather than seaplane, flight, my other half really wanted to experience a seaplane, or float plane as they seem to be called here.\n\nKenmore quickly refunded us our San Juan flight costs and we went in to rebook.\n\nAt this stage, I should say that if you are interested in planes, then a personal visit to the headquarters in Kenmore is well worth it.  Hangers where work is being carried out, a lovely admin building, with small shop containing - you've guessed it - flight related gifts and souvenirs, and just so many beautiful planes both out of and on the water.\n\nThe lovely girls on Reception helped us choose another flight and we went for the scenic flight around Seattle, leaving from their base on Union Lake.  Easy to get to via public transport and, again, a good space with a more limited shop, waiting room, restrooms etc.\n\nOur pilot Brian was good humoured and friendly (happy to pose for pictures afterwards) and we were fortunate to just have ourselves and one other couple on board.  We donned headphones, which had a running commentary on them, as we flew around Seattle, seeing all the major landmarks.\n\nThis was a bucket list experience for both of us, so it was always going to be a real thrill and I am quite unashamed in waxing lyrical about it.\n\nHowever, the professionalism and efficiency of Kenmore, their willingness and determination to help us fulfil our dream cannot be underestimated and was much appreciated."

She had never been before, and I considered the Clipper, before I realized I could enjoy a lifelong dream of flying in a seaplane for only a bit more money.\nService on both ends was amazing, our pilots were both fantastic, and the overall experience was just outstanding. I couldn't have been happier. The experience, the views, all out of this world. \nAs a native Seattleite, I always drove to Vancouver to take the ferry over, but when you're in the city without a car, these \"more expensive\" options (like the clipper or Kenmore Air) become much more reasonable. I even heard one guy say it was cheaper than flying from Sea-Tac to Victoria, nevermind the fact that he'd have to deal with ground transportation on either end, and long airport delays! \nDefinitely check it out, you owe it to yourself!"

My friend was in town visiting from Eastern Washington, and we decided to give this tour a try. It was one of my favorite local excursions yet. I hadn't been on a bike in a while, but you know the saying, and the 6-or-so-mile ride was very pleasant (and appropriate for people of almost all fitness levels). Felicia did a great job of giving us some insights and history about different locations along the tour without making it feel too touristy. The cadence of the tour was great--I never felt like we were lingering in one spot for too long, but we were also allowed to sit down and enjoy ourselves at the different food stops along the way. Our \"tasting\" options were delicious and diverse. And filling. I was happy I hadn't eaten breakfast that morning. \n\nOverall, I felt like I really got a great Alki experience and was able to visit more places than I would have if I had just gone over for a day trip on my own. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting from out of town and even local Seattleites looking for a fun afternoon activity. \n\nOne tip: if it's a sunny day (lucky you!) and you are fair-skinned like I am, make sure to pack your sunscreen."

My teen and twenty something thought it was entertaining as well as filling. In fact, they only had a couple appetizers for dinner after our afternoon tour! We all enjoyed ourselves while learning about the history of the market and Seattle. Additionally, we supported Beechers for lunch another day and we purchased Ellenos yogurt to enjoy while there and took it home after purchasing it in the airport.\n\nNow, a few words about our tour guide, Miriam.  Entertaining! Knowledgeable! Accommodating! Thoughtful! Engaging! Personable! She was careful to wait and make space for the woman on the electric cart at every single location. She picked up extra menus for the gentleman who asked at every actual restaurant.  Miriam engaged each person on the tour, especially the younger ones and by getting to know them better she’d try to tie the tour information to their interests. She was fun and funny.  Honestly, if I lived in town, I would not only make sure that everyone who came to visit would go on the tour, I would do everything I could to make sure Miriam was their guide.\n\nMy only suggestion is to promote the Truffle shop as Truffle Oil or something because we thought we were getting chocolate truffles."

Well, at least that day!  Be sure to bring a WATER BOTTLE--it says it in the printed information with the ticket, but who reads that?  Some of our fellow tasters were pretty thirsty by the end!

We didn't know much about Seattle before this and actually found we could have spent more time there quite happily. Anyway, we got to see many of the city's neighbourhoods and attractions and got a feel for the place, with several stops to walk around and take photos etc. Even got to see the famous view of Seattle from 'Frasier's' eyrie. At end of tour, Doug dropped us off at the cruise terminal with plenty of time to spare. A most enjoyable morning and well worth doing as an orientation if you haven't been to Seattle before."

The tour was 30 minute longer than we expected and did I mention Chuck?  The Chuckster??  Once you've met him you will never forget him!  We got to see many of the highlights of Seattle, which we would never have seen on our few hours there, had it not been for this tour.   It was a fantastic time and we were all so glad we did this tour.  See the pictures for all the highlights!"

You can probably see the same stuff on a large tour boat but this is like having your own boat cruising around with friends, as Dylan told us stories and gave us background on everything we saw around the lake. The sun was shining, the day was warm, but not too hot. A perfect day spent waiting for our Alaska cruise to commence the following cay. "

The boat ride was definitely worth the wait!  Genevieve did a wonderful job!  The floating houses were amazing!  We saw water planes take off and land, people jumping off their front porches into the lake, dug out canoes. Such a fun trip!  I highly recommend!!"

    "description": "This chef-guided market tour takes a journey through Pacific Northwest culture by tasting Seattle’s best artisan vendors in the famous Pike Place Market. Enjoy diverse tastings at 9 different locations— and food options like chocolate covered cherries, chowder, and much more. All groups are kept to 12 guests to ensure easier navigation of the market, more tastings, and a better platform to ask questions and interact with the group. Leave with a 10% discount card to shop and explore after the tour. \n\n*Note that tours stops may adjust depending on time of year and guide.\n\nThis is a walking tour that does require a moderate amount of physical fitness due to distance, small hills, stairs and cobblestone terrain. \n\nThis is a market tour that includes walking/standing and not a restaurant tour with a variety of food alternatives and sitting opportunities. \n\n",

An excellent introduction to Seattle!"

Two things stood out with this tour, first was the fact that we were shown not just the city but the surrounding area.  The falls visit was spectacular and Terry showed us many hidden gems throughout the tour.  The second but most important part of the tour was our guide, Terry.  He went above and beyond ensuring that our tour was time well spent.  From his historical knowledge of the city to his expertise with photography, we were able to get a feel for Seattle.  He even made recommendations on where to eat after - Highly recommend Cutters Crabhouse! Thank you, Terry, for making this a top-notch experience.  It was four hours of time well spent and i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the Seattle area"

Roen was an excellent guide, covering the history of the area and combining it with 8 very impressive food or drink locations along the way. We learnt heaps, and really enjoyed the wonderful slow food / drink we tried, such a change from the usual fast food America is famous for. It was obvious from the start that the creators of these products were passionate about the ingredients and quality of their product, and Roen was passionate about opening our eyes to the growing food culture of the area. Excellent value for the money, highly recommended if you're passionate about local, quality food produced with pride."

Thank you for making our 6-year anniversary so memorable! \n\nWe will 100% be recommending this tour (and Karen as the guide) to all of our friends and family."

        "reviewBody": "We did a day tour on Sunday Feb 9, being picked up in Port Angeles, where it was 40 degrees, a light wintry mix. Very early in the season and we couldn't have been happier with the lack of crowds. Evergreen Escapes contacted us to make sure we had the proper gear for the weather, which we had, but they still brought along extra gloves and rain gear. \n\nWe started in Port Austin, picked up at our hotel. It was just the two of us and our guide Marty. We talked about what we wanted to see and do in the area and Marty tailored the trip to us. Our first stop was Hurricane Ridge. After passing the gate, and making way for the plow, we pulled over to put on the tire chains. Minutes later back on the road, discussing the geology of the area, how it was the sea floor  at one time. Beautiful switchback drive up, lots of gorgeous views and we had big breaks in the clouds giving us sunny valleys to look down on. Both on the way up and down we passed backcountry skiers setting off up the mountain for some gorgeous powder. \n\nReaching the top we parked and it was prep for phase 2: snowshoeing. if you know how to walk, you know now how to snowshoe. Marty mad sure we were fitted right, gave us the option for trekking poles, explained how to walk in snowshoes and we set off. The local ski lift was open with skiers and snowboarders enjoying the fresh snow and 18 degrees. We set off over a meadow and into the trees. walking on 5-6 feet of snow. Do you know what a tree well is? Marty did and explained how they form and the danger they can present. Funny enough, walking a a downslope, my wife got caught on the edge of one and she used her poles to lever herself away from the edge and we pressed on. We got onto a trail that cross country skiers like to use for a downhill leg and we passed skiers and other snowshoers. it was a great walk in the snowy woods, quiet, pristine and just beautiful.\n\nComing back down from Hurricane Ridge we took a side road west through the forest, passing some beautiful homes on the edge of the Olympic National park and went over to the Elwah River and up the road as far as it would go, since the road had washed out short of the Elwah Dam Removal. the River is gorgeous, fast and cold and we're told it changes color with the season and the melting of snow and glaciers in summer. We did see a beautiful little waterfall jsut a quick 1/10 of a mile from the parking lot.\n\nAfter that it was on to Lake Crescent. We drove up to a beautiful bay, with a great view of the lake and the mountains that drop seemingly to the water'e edge. Marty got the stoves going, soup was on, chicken was available with noodles or in the soup, some great scones and tea and we were warm and ready for more.\n\nWe next went to Salt Creek and if you didn't have someone local to get you there, you might miss it. There are sea stacks there, the tide was out and we walked a lot of the flats below the cliffs; tidal pools had clams and starfisn, lots of bullwhip kelp. No seals that day and a little too early for whales in the strait. But after exploring the flats we got back in the van and drove up to a coampground on the point. The campground was a former miltary gun emplacement in WWII, with bunkers still on-sght, some of which you can drive through. There's a great staircase and walkway to the water with excellent views back to the beach and of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\n\nAfter that we drove back to Port Angeles, taking a little detour down to the waterfront/harbor. A few ships moving in and out of port. We were a week early for seasonal start of the ferry to Victoria, B.C. but you can see across the strait to Victoria.\n\nThat was the end of our tour day because we had a car and were driving back to Seattle. The ferry ride is super easy, whether you do it yourself or if you're in the van. Either way, you get out of your car, up topside where you can sit inside or go outside and see the best views of Seattle. And we came in on the 6:30 ferry in early February, so the city was lit up and even looks beautifu at night. Our hotel was a 3 minute drive from the ferry so it was a breeze.\n\nWe had driven ourselves to Olympia the night before, getting up early and were at the the Quinnault Rainforest by 9am. We did a few different trail loops there through the rainforest.  We never heard or saw anyone else out on the trail. There was some fog, some breaks in the forest into sunny meadows, the river roars throught the gorges and the trail along Lake Quinnaut is a beautiful view. We then drove up to Ruby Beach, reaching it at low tide. Great seastacks, an easy trail down to the beach. The beach was piled high with driftwood, actually, huge tree trunks, many over a 100 feet long. We walked around those, found a log that had fallen across a stream and walked north of Ruby Beach, closer to seastacks and even more beautiful views. We told Marty about this and he said that Evergreen Escapes also does a 3 day tour in the area, and gets to those same places. I would definitely recommend taking the 3 day tour (you do stay indoors btw). \n\nWe skimmed the highlights of the Olympic National Park on our own and with a guide. I certainly recommend going with a guide whether it's half-day, all day or 3 days. They'll show you more than you'd seeon your own and have so much knowledge about the area that they're happy to share as much as you want. We wholehertedly recommend that you use Evergreen Escapes when visiting the Pacific Northwest!"

Then way down low into the Elwha River Valley for a gourmet lunch by the river where we also saw a beautiful waterfall. Then onto Lake Crescent and a short hike around the rainforest. Had never seen old growth forest before. \n\nOur guide Evan was superb! He had excellent knowledge of the history, culture, and environment. We had good group camaraderie and exchanged stories and songs we like."

For someone who does not know the area, both made this experience easy and stressless. I traveled solo and was looking for a safe way to explore a park, hands down this was the perfect way to do it! I got a history lesson, saw some of the most beautiful parts of the park, but the best part might have been the outside lunch under beautiful trees! Meeting neat people was a bonus!  I would have book other adventures with them if time permitted but my experience with Evergreen will make me come back for more adventures in the future."

Cleared up, could tour on upper deck, inside or front and back of boat.  Seating inside is on banquet chairs.  The cruise was delightful.  Friendly service. Great views with narration.  We all enjoyed it (young adults 25-30 and a 59 yr old) Recommend getting there early to get the seating you like best, but all views are good.  You get 3 tokens for the wine.  Two separate lines, one for tokens (checking ID) and one for wine.  Full bar and light snacks available too."

Once we arrived my daughter and I had plenty of casually time to walk Leavenworth and take in the sights. Cheryl drove us back to Seattle by a new route so we were able to stop at several scenic overlooks. I recommend this tour 100% for anyone who wants to sit back and let someone else worry about navigating the windy mountainous roads! \nThanks Cheryl!"

Please note that the itinerary outlined is a SAMPLE of potential destinations that could be included in the tour.\n\nWalk along the blast-swept Eruption Trail with panoramic views of the devastation and the mountain’s crater. You may even glimpse a herd of Roosevelt elk! \n\nNo two tours with Evergreen Escapes are the same! Our guides craft itineraries that reflect the best of what the Park has to offer that day. We’ll offer stops at some of our favorite spots like Coldwater Lake or the Hummocks Trail. This isn’t just another driving tour of a beautiful landscape - we prefer to keep guests outside the vehicle for walks to experience firsthand.\n\nOur all-inclusive small-group day tour is limited to just 10 travelers. We'll bring a local, organic, family-style lunch and eat outside when it's nice! Don’t worry about a thing!",

The trip was worth every penny as it opened my thoughts to nature and the majestic power that the 1980 volcanic eruption of Mount Saint Helens caused. Yet, the damage of the 1980 eruption was replaced by new lakes and greenery. If you are open to seeing nature in a new way, and are willing to have your perceptions of the incredible force of the Mount Saint Helens 1980 volcanic eruption enhanced a thousand fold—then this tour is for you! Wow is all I can say! Brent Maphis, Naturalist Guide, did a spectacular job gently guiding the tour group toward a new and fuller understanding of the incredible Mount Saint Helens Volcanic Monument. Way to go to Evergreen Escapes and Brent Maphis on a job well done! Bravo!"

She made sure we all got to know each other, and as it was me plus a party of four who knew each other, this made me feel part of the crew!\n\nWe swapped life stories during the drive and the social aspect was really pleasant without being overwhelming.\n\nAs for the tour itself, we made a stop in Lewis and Clark State Park to walk among the tall trees of a genuine pacific northwest old-growth forest, and it was an experience I will never, ever forget!\n\nSadly as we went on to the main part of our trip, we didn't get to see the top of Mount St.Helens, but the small walks that we did got us fairly close to the mountain and allowed us to appreciate nature's beauty and power.\n\nWe ended the day at a place called North Fork Survivors. This newly-founded museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the people who perished in the volcanic eruption is maintained by Joe, who happens to be a Sasquatch researcher working with a University to collect data on this elusive primate. He is passionate both about his work on his museum and about his research. He is as dedicated, articulate and convincing as he is friendly, and this stop on the way back to Seattle could very well be the highlight of your day!\n\nThe other guests were elderly people, and the so the tour was kind of mellow, but I didn't mind at all! It only showed me how Evergreen Escapes will tailor the day to people of all ages and abilities to make sure everybody gets the best out of their day.\n\nMy only (very minor) gripe is that I would've liked to see a bit more of Mount St.Helens from various other viewpoints, as this is the theme of the tour, but I still got to see plenty of it : )) \n\nSo hats off to Kayla, who was funny, friendly, well-organized and insightful, for making this tour an unforgettable experience I most definitely recommend!"

Our guide Kayla was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, articulate and had a great personality and a wonderful sense of humor. The tour itself was awesome. We hiked several trails  at appropriate intervals during the drive and were served a beautiful picnic lunch in a park near Coldwater Lake. Dinner plates with silverware,  tablecloth, and cloth napkins were set out with sliced chicken breast, a bean salad and a cheese corn salad, tofu, and dessert. It was a memorable tour with a number of other interesting stops and we all enjoyed the whole day. Definitely a 5-star adventure."

We went on the Discovery Point tour and had a great time!  Like the previous reviewer wrote... we saw seals, bald eagles, and a sea lion.  Our guide Devon did a great job... My wife ended up in his Kayak.  He took great care of her... and got an extra workout since she has had a shoulder injury and wasn't really up to paddling.  Lunch on the beach was nice... very good sandwiches and fruit!  This is a first class operation and highly recommended!"

On the way back we did a little bit of kayak surfing (which I didn't know was a thing) before entering the marina."

Since I was solo, I was in the kayak with the guide, who was great. The other 2 were brand new to kayaking, so we didn't paddle as far or as fast as I had expected, but I had a very good time. Maybe I missed the small print, but I didn't expect to be in a 2-person kayak - I assumed I would have my own. I would have had a little more fun if I'd been free to paddle a little more.\n\nBut I highly recommend the company - everything was well-organized and it was a really nice day out on the water."

It was very relaxing and chill, we where able to see some sea otters that followed our Kayak. On Discovery Point, we hiked around a little bit and then just relaxed on the beach which was very secluded while having lunch. Overall, I would recommend it. It gets you away from the high tourist areas and your actually doing something versus just looking at something even though there was plenty of beautiful sites to see on the kayak."

Our guides, Blaine & Devon, were awesome: funny, patient, informative, helpful--even to the point of towing a kayak with people who couldn't get the hang of paddling! One of us was a beginner, and had no problems learning how to paddle/maneuver/steer even in open water.\nThe lunch provided was good, but not \"gourmet\"--sandwiches, chips, vitamin water, grapes, berries.\nThere is no short hike to Discovery Bluff--they need to remove this from the tour description, as we were looking forward to the hike. Our stop at the beach allowed for a brief (no more than 10 minutes) walk down the beach toward an inaccessible lighthouse."

They gave a great little introduction to kayaking and then shared tons of interesting information during the tour - very knowledgeable about Sound ecology. Matt shared a kayak with our son (8-years-old) and kept him thoroughly engaged and excited about the trip. Thank you Matt! We saw about three harbor seals during the trip. The lunch was fine - sandwiches, fruit, and drinks - but tasted especially good on the beach at Discovery Point. We didn't hike - there was just enough time to explore the beach a bit and relax over lunch; if you want to hike you'd really have to grab your sandwich and get moving. For us it was perfect. The marina where they launch is really nice also - perfect spot to relax and have a coffee looking at the boats and cool Lief Ericson sculpture before or after the tour. Would definitely book again!"

The story telling and engagement were fine, but I expected more use of the Planetarium’s visual effects since that’s the part we came for that you can’t get elsewhere. There were also too few step stools for toddlers to engage on higher exhibits. The most frustrating part was waiting in line with people who needed tickets when we had pre-purchased tickets. An attendant was monitoring the line already and could have checked our Tickets and sent us in, relieving some of the stress on the cashiers and making our pre-purchase worthwhile."

It reminded me so much of when I was little. I feel like not much has changed. I remember my brother's boy scout troop sleeping in the dinosaur room. And of course the butterfly room was always my favorite and still is. It is not as busy as I remember it being, but then again I came during the middle of the week so that might have something to do with it. I spent literally hours and the butterfly room. I just could not get enough of it. I would gladly go back and do it again. It is $26 for an adult but they do offer military discount. I also went and saw the IMAX movie superdogs. Originally I was very skeptical thinking it would be a dumb kids movie but it was actually extremely entertaining. They talked about all the things dogs can be trained to do to help society from rescuing people from avalanches to finding them in natural disasters. They talk about how they choose the dogs and train them. I would highly recommend going and watching this video. Highly educational and very interesting. And that says a lot since I'm not a pet person. Overall a great day at the children's museum. "

We usually have kids with us, but had the weekend for just us.  We had a blast! They had a scavenger hunt going on over the weekend, and it was fun to participate in that, and talk to staff we probably wouldn't have without it. \n\nThey have a butterfly house with some beautiful butterflies, and we thought that was really neat, and they also have a tide pool area where you can touch the different creatures! The vibe is very similar to OMSI if your are from Portland Oregon or have been to OMSI there, but with some additional cool features.\n\nMost of the exhibits were really interactive and fun, and made me want to take my 5 year old here when we come back! \n\nOverall, a great experience!"

Lucky began the tour with some history of the market, gave us some brief logistics of this expansive market and pointed out some interesting things along the waterfront.\n\nLucky took us through the very busy market on Saturday with ease as his experience was evident in not only how to get through the crowds but showing us the very best vendors. All of the tastings we were given were unique and t delicious. We got to see the salmon toss at the Pike Place Fish Market, and all in the group got to try the smoked salmon..\n\nThe two hour tour went by in a blink.  Lucky was knowledgeable, funny and very experienced. Without Lucky’s guidance, the market would have been overwhelming. If your interest lie in visiting the Pike Place Market, I highly recommend Show Me Seattle and by all means request Lucky, you won’t be disappointed."

We have mobility issues so I intentionally scheduled tours which did not require hiking and other physical activities.  We were very much looking forward to tasting different coffees. (We lived in Central America which makes some of the best coffee in the world.)  Unfortunately, we were the only two people signed up for this tour so, rather than run it for the two of us, they cancelled.  I never did get to do any chocolate tastings or tours of chocolate shops. VERY disappointing.\n\nI will say that the owner went out of his way to confirm with me two days in advance; and then made EVERY effort imaginable to track me down to inform me of the cancellation.  He left a voice message for me at home, but realized it was an answering machine probably at my home and he knew I was on vacation out of state.  My cell phone doesn't usually work, but the owner persevered.  He called the hotel and the Front Desk Clerk tracked me down during the hotel's Wine Hour.  I appreciate the owner's efforts to not just stand us up; and I believe that he will in fact credit my AmEx card in full, therefore, in spite of the cancellation, I'll give them three stars. \n\nBut I sure wish they would have run the tour for the two of us.  Do that and you'd get a bunch of five star reviews which will generate more interest going forward.  Just a thought..."

Our guide James was the perfect host - his extensive knowledge of the city, solicitousness over his charge's comfort, and excellent good humor was a highlight of the tour, as well. Between James, the knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides at each site, the most enjoyable companionship of my fellow travelers, and the delicious coffees, chocolates, and wines with tapas, it was a great way to leisurely enjoy a side of the city I rarely take the time to see. Well worth it."

Our experienced guides lead small groups through, and beneath, Pioneer Square to the street level that existed in the 1890s. Explore underground pathways that were built more than 120 years ago, learning details on early Seattle history, why these spaces were built, and how they have been used (and misused) over the years. Marvel at how this once Indian encampment has since transformed into one of the 20 largest cities in the United States. ",

This is the only cruise that leaves directly from downtown Seattle, allowing you to skip the traffic and get out on the water. With the guidance of a trained onboard naturalist, you will be taken to an area world-renowned for wildlife, where you will be on the lookout for orca, minke and humpback whales as well as Dall’s porpoise, seals, otters, bald eagles and more! Afterwards, you will have a stopover in Friday Harbor for a chance to grab a bite to eat or explore.",

        "reviewBody": "This is one of the most disappointing travel arrangements I have ever experienced. I booked months in advance through Clipper to take the ferry from Seattle to Friday Harbor on the morning of Friday 9/21, followed immediately by a whale watching tour, 2 nights at a hotel, and then the ferry back from Friday Harbor to Seattle on Sunday night.\n\nI showed up on Friday morning ready for a relaxing trip only to be told that the bus was waiting for me. However, my package included no bus travel. To my disappointment the company advised me that the boat was out of service (and had been for about 5 weeks). They stated that they decided on Monday to cancel the Friday sailing, and sent an email about this. However I received their prior confirmation email, but no cancellation email. They also said they left a message and sent a text the day before - but apparently they sent that to my home phone instead of cell phone by accident.\n\nLong story short, on Friday morning our choices were cancel the trip or take a 90 minutes bus to Anacortes, have a 2 hour wait at Anacortes, take the ferry to Friday Harbor and reschedule the Whale Watching tour for Sunday. So, we agreed to this - though this is not what we wanted or had planned - and made the best of the trip there. At this point we were told that the boat would be back in service on Sunday and that we would have no issue with the last chance at whale watching or the ferry back to Seattle.\n\nOn Sunday morning we were scheduled to meet at 12noon for the Whale Watching tour. At 8:30am I get a text message saying this and the direct ferry back to Seattle were cancelled. There is now no reschedule option for the Whale Watching, and we'll be getting back to Seattle until about 3 hours after we were scheduled.\n\nOverall, Friday Harbor was great... but I would NEVER trust Clipper with my vacation plans again. Customer service was great to help provide some refunds, but no refund can replace the opportunity for Whale Watching when you aren't a local to the area."

I was very disappointed when a few days before our 9/21 departure we received an email that the ferry was cancelled.  The alternative transportation option was a grumpy bus ride to Anacortes and walking on the ferry to Friday Harbor (Tix are $13pp) with a 50% refund for this leg.  We would have been better off renting a car from Seattle and skipping Clipper all together but we believed them when they promised that ferry would be up and running for our trip back on 9/23.  Guess what, at 10am on 9/23 we receive a text update that the clipper ferry is cancelled due to mechanical issues.  We opted not to take the alternative transportation putting us in Seattle 3 hours after the time we were supposed to arrive on the ferry.  Instead we booked a flight and it was a dream.  Skip this ferry, go for the flight."

While it's totally understandable that the company doesn't want to take passengers out into an unsafe situation, I wish we would have been told in advance that the whale watching portion of the trip was cancelled. We did receive both an email and text message (excellent communication) the afternoon before the trip - the message implied that one part of the trip would be cancelled but that they would still provide a bus to the harbor. The message also said they were going to refund the first part of the trip (again, solid business practice). We mistakenly thought we would just miss the sightseeing portion but still get to see whales during the second portion near the harbor. When we got to the pier the next morning, we were then told that the whale watching portion of the trip was cancelled. This left us reeling trying to figure out what to do that day and very disappointed. The employee at the desk was friendly and told us to explain to the parking attendant what happened but we were still charged $5 to park by the pier. ($5 not being a big deal obviously, but it did feel like a little slap in the face in the moment.) To avoid this confusion in the future I would recommend making the messages a little clearer that the whale watching portion of the trip is not going to take place despite being taken to the harbor and to somehow make sure customers don't have to pay for parking."

        "reviewBody": "Extremely disappointed with our experience with Clipper Vacations. Our San Juan trip was cancelled without us being notified at all. We arrived at the pier at 6:50am to see on the departure screen that the San Juan trip was cancelled. The agent explained that we should have received an email, text, or voicemail notifying us; however, we did not receive anything. In fact we were even able to check in online and print our boarding passes just the night before. They were not able to explain why their system was still able to allow us to do that. However, with regards to the cancellation notice, they claim that they have no contact information in their system. We found that very odd because we were still able to receive our confirmation email before and we had given them our email address and phone number when we booked over the phone. In fact, we booked over the phone because when we called to ask for more information about the San Juan trip, we were told that their online booking system tends to have problems. From our experience, their phone booking system seem equally flawed. Nevertheless, our main dissatisfaction was that there was no notice what so ever for the cancellation; not even an alert or anything on their website. How would anyone know if they were not able to be contacted? We had to arrange a vacation day with our workplace in order to make this trip, but that seemed to have been done for nothing.\n\nUltimately, Clipper Vacations needs to improve their online system. We are at least grateful that we were told we would get a full refund (hopefully); however, we are extremely disappointed with our experience with Clipper Vacations."

    "description": "This cooking class experience consists of a tour through the famous Pike Place Market where the chef will explain the local and seasonal produce as he/she selects the ingredients for the menu being cooked. The group ends up in the beautiful Atrium kitchen in the market where the chef instructs the preparation of the menu; providing tips on cooking techniques, information about the meal and tidbits of Seattle’s history. We then sit down to indulge in our gourmet dishes. All ingredients used are sourced in the Northwest. The menus are thoughtfully designed to learn new techniques, maximize seasonal flavors and inspire your inner-chef to replicate these recipes at home.\n\nThe format of this class is a combination of hands-on and demonstration to ensure that our guests get the most of the teachings and those that would like to participate can do so. We understand that some people want to relax and some want to be active. It's works well for both.",

Super excited when Liz emailed and let me know she would be doing some pop-up classes with a smaller group and I picked to learn how to make Halibut and Panzanella.\n\nAs a Seattleite, I hit the local markets often to get seafood and vegetables.  I do most of my meals at home and love to cook!  Liz showed me some new tricks and techniques that I will use in my day to day cooking.\n\nThe Panzanella salad will now be on repeat all summer long too!\n\nI love that this was a small group (5 of us!) and Liz made sure we were all safe. She wore a face shield and we were all spaced out.\n\nThe group was fun and we were all locals, but anyone coming from out of town should absolutely take this class! You will learn new tips and tricks that you will be able to take home to your kitchen to utilize in your day to day cooking.\n\nThank you Chef Liz! I will definitely take more of your classes in the future!"

    "description": "One of the best times of year to visit Mount Rainier is in the winter months. When the days get shorter, the summer crowds head home, and the park turns into a true winter wonderland, come visit Longmire in Mount Rainier National Park!\n\nStroll through the old-growth forests, where Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar trees dwarf visitors. The bubbling natural springs tell a story of what lies beneath this abundant and volatile landscape. Experience the natural silence that takes hold as the snow dusted trees insulate the world around you. Learn the diverse history the Longmire area and how this region has attracted visitors long before it was a national park.\n\nAfter arriving at Mt. Rainier, you will get out to experience as much of the Longmire area as possible for the day. Explore beyond the vehicle during walks and hikes with your guide by your side the entire time. If conditions call for snowshoes, your guide will provide an introductory lesson on how to stay safe and enjoy your walk. ",

(Hint hint: makes for some great pics and storytelling) She was honest and passionate about her job and the wilderness but down to earth and did everything she could to make our trip special (despite my forgetting to mention before the trip that is was both of our birthdays) The Snoqualmie falls walk is VERY short so don’t choose this one if you’re looking for a hike but do choose this one if you are looking to drink a lot of very nice wines and get very toasty. We were planning on going out to dinner afterwards but they provided us with such a bounty of dry snacks, fresh locally sourced lunch, and drinks that by the time we were dropped back at the hotel we were much too alcohol soaked and full to do so. Well worth the price! In fact an Uber all the way there and back from Seattle as well as all that we consumed very well may have cost us not much less! Thank you Jann and thank you Evergreen escapes!"

Experience the vibrant tastes and sights of Seattle, while exploring distinct neighborhoods such as Chinatown and catch the perfect views from Queen Ann Hill. This public tour provides an excellent overview of Central Seattle from a comfortable bus with large viewing windows. Our tour stops at least four times throughout the excursion. We allow you to get out some on foot to explore as we believe it helps in experiencing the city and neighborhoods properly. We only offer one tour a day so we thrive on making ours the most complete tour of Seattle without you feeling like you're being hurried. Another great benefit is there is NO extra charge to be picked up at 90 percent of Seattle hotels- we are the ONLY tour company to offer this benefit- GRATIS! IF PREARRANGED IN ADVANCE we can even offer drop-offs at Cruise Ports for an EXTRA FEE after the tour ends (AFTER 2:30pm). ",

Navigating Seattle streets with its hodgepodge of construction and road closures is a feat in itself.  But Joe provided a steady narration of the different buildings as we passed on our way to various sites. He shared researched information about the neighborhoods we were seeing. Pioneer Square was wonderful with stops at the Glassblowing Studio, UPS tribute park, and the Klondike Gold Rush Museum. Of course there is never enough time (or parking) when at Pike Place Market as the sights and sounds are plentiful—just a people watcher’s paradise. Too many choices in a really short time! We watched a ship traverse part of the Ballard Locks and took in the high up views from the Queen Anne overlooks. We’d completely forgotten about the Fremont Troll, and Joe brought us up to date on the Fremont Summer Solstice Celebration. We will definitely recommend a tour with Joe to friends visiting Seattle. He was generous with his time and knowledge and allowed for slower walkers, bathroom breaks, and extra photo opportunities. We haven’t even mentioned the Space Needle, the stadiums, the architecture, or the Seattle artwork. It was an all inclusive experience!"

We went to three small distilleries where we were thoroughly enlightened about the distilling process and their products as well as tasting ALL their products.  After the first distillery we were greeted back at the bus with a small dish on local sausage and sauerkraut.  Yum!  Between two and three we were treated to another small cocktail and a delicious cupcake.  All in all, they did a very classy job all the way.  Sounds like a lot of booze but it really wasn't.  This is not a \"party cruise\".  We took the \"happy hour\" tour which is on Fridays at 2:45 pm.  "

Great for couples, small groups and probably an amazing corporate team event if you booked the whole van, which I think seats about 10 people."

The first benefit is obviously someone driving you from distillery to distillery so you don't have to worry about someone in your party being the DD, but through that activity, you get to stop by a handful of fantastic distilleries in the area, see how their products are made, and sample some delicious vodkas, gins, whiskeys and more along the way. Plus, as an added bonus, you receive a couple handmade cocktails en route to the distilleries, AND yummy local snacks. This is a definite must-do in the area, and something that I, as a resident, will be going on again"

The tour guide offered no information or background on any of the distilleries. The first and last distillery visits were fun and filled with detail and tastes. \nThe middle one was not on the itinerary. The distillery rep had a chip on his shoulder and bad mouthed the other distilleries on the tour. This distillery was dirty and not worth the stop. \nThe snacks were pretty good. The Sprinter bus was comfortable. \nThe bartender kit was a glass shaker and shot glass in a cute paper bag. It fell short of what a \"kit\" would usually consist of. \nI guess we expected more."

    "description": "Specialties Ba Bar is the place for authentic Vietnamese cuisine in Seattle. We use the highest quality ingredients to create the best Pho in town. We also have one of the top selections of high end spirits on Capitol Hill and we make a great Moscow Mule to boot. Bonus - we serve food until 1:30am on weeknights and 3:30am on weekends. History Established in 2011. Sophie and Eric Banh grew up together eating street food in Saigon, and that was really the inspiration for Ba Bar. When they first opened Monsoon Seattle in 1999, they drew much of their inspiration from the very same \"street food\" we are serving. With Ba Bar we're just a little closer to the street. But yeah, same owners. Same chefs. Same commitment to quality. And did you know, Ba means father and number 3 in Vietnamese?",

Then journey through old growth forests, around rustic logging towns, and across mighty rivers into the charming city of Portland.

JD and Jolie worked to make sure the tour was set up as planned!\n\nJill is the most amazing tour guide! She checked in ahead of time with tips and pointers. She knew exactly which trails would reveal breathtaking vistas and all the extra little places which makes this region so special. I learnt not only about the region but some super useful hiking tips for my next time on the trail. She kept things on schedule without it being rushed with plenty time to enjoy and take pictures. In addition, when hurricane Dorian on the east coast meant I had to adjust my travel plans she coordinated seamlessly with the team to ensure that we could still maximize the trip! The tour felt like an amazing sight seeing trip with family!!\n\nThe 4 day tour is the best way to get an overview of as much as possible. Since the tour moves from place to place there is no time wasted driving back and forth to home base. Also, the option to have a private tour allowed for customization so from Bainbridge there was a visit to the cute little Nordic town of Poulsbo and then on to the beauty of Olympic Park with crescent lake and hoh rain forest. I was able to get my Twilight fix an can attest that the pizza in Forks in yummy! Astoria had the best seafood of my entire trip and Mt Rainier was breathtaking. From enchanted forests to mountain vistas straight out of sound of music and quaint friendly historic towns this tour has it all. \n\nThanks so much Jill and team incredible adventures. Cheers! "

Eric did a really good job of guiding whether it be hiking, driving, restaurants, history & local knowledge. \nOnly thing I'd change personally is to skip Portland or Port Angels and spend and extra day hiking arond Mt. Ranier or other Nat'l Park."

Seeing these mountains up close was absolutely unreal. I’m still processing it. You also get a great view from both sides of the plane because they turn around. I sat on the left side and I think that is the best side to be on imo!\n\nPilot was super nice and even took a selfie with us. \n\nI do wish there was a tour guide there to give facts and history on the mountains and Washington’s nature in general. After a while you’re just looking out the window which is fine but some kind of live or prerecorded audio for a guided tour would be great. Also I suggest bringing ear plugs for the noise but not sure if that’s unsafe or not.\n\nIf you’re not good on rollercoasters the ascend and descend will be roughhhh, but you’ll be okay once it’s in cruise control it’ll feel like you’re on a couch lol.\n\nA great birthday gift to my brother!"

Ranier, and went almost all the way around it, did a U-turn so everyone could get teh same view, then headed to Mt. St. Helens and flew the same kind of route.  The areas of devastation took me back to the photos I remember seeing in 1980.  If you go for this trip, take advantage of the free earplugs that are available inside the doors just before you head out to the tarmac.  It's loud on the plane!"

Saint Helen's numerous times and we have seen them countless times flying into and out of SeaTac Airport; they are impressive sites, for sure. But flying just a few hundred feet above offers another level of appreciation of their magnitude and splendor. So if you can afford it, this flight is definitely worth the price. The route makes passes around the mountains in both directions so all passengers get a great look. The aircraft is a nine-passenger one with wings above the fuselage so all windows provide good site-lines. The space is comfortable enough for a 90-minute flight. There is no narration, however, so I suggest printing out a bit of information or a map to help identify parts of the mountains, other peaks, rivers and lakes. Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, the Cowlitz and Toutle Rivers are all clearly visible."

The tour, no headphones on this trip just a speaker in the middle of the top floor, so when   people start talking(annoyingly loudly) you can't hear a thing, not that that mattered as everything that was broadcasted was one stop behind us. We were told not to move around the bus unless at a complete stop, no stop buttons upstairs that we could see,  so we waited for the bus to stop at a designated HOHOff stop, bus driver stopped for a few seconds and drove on. Very frustrating. Why aren't the stop announced and stopped at for at least enough time to get down the stairs and off. This was the dearest tour we've ever done, a one day pass cost the same as a three day pass in Rome. \n1 star as I can't give 0 🤬🤬🤬🤬"

And it takes you just around the center. You can actually walk it if you bring some time. I still had to walk alot, since e.g. the Jimmy Hendrix Statue is not included. The explanations are only in English over the general PA system of the bus. Sometime it was difficult to understand. It's the first hoho tour I did where you could not chose a language over headphones. I thought that was a standard. The drivers don't want to see your ticket at no point. I had a couple next to me talking about making the tour without ticket. That is not cool. Unfortunately I felt like the tour is a waste of money. Better to explore Seattle by foot and use the money for the entrance to some also very expensive tourist attractions. "

So happy I did that because it definitely isn’t worth full price.  This is basically an over priced bus ride. Not a lot of history about Seattle, but it is a hop on off bus. Then to top it off they say a bus comes around every 30 minutes or so but it’s more like 45 minutes to an hour. If you basically just want to go along to the different places along the water and don’t want to walk there is a FREE trolley. Wish we would have known that before hand."

We started the morning at Raging River, flowy trials and ended the day at Tiger Mountain, much more technical.  He was was very good at letting me know what to expect, allowing me to ride at my capabilities  I have been mountain biking for 25 years and this was the most fun I have had."

I ride advanced and I was very impressed with the quality of the trails design/flow and obstacles.\n\nThat said, I've never ridden Seattle.  I only had limited time and I didn't want to waste any time figuring out routes on my own and that's when I started looking for a guide.  I spoke with and ended up riding with Matt Paul.  Matt is an excellent guide and made this experience extraordinary from a client perspective.  \n\nHe was timely for pickup, hospitable and what I REALLY appreciated was that he drove safely and prioritized.  This is very important to me being from a small town and not being used to the city traffic, I felt very comfortable as a passenger. \n\nBefore we rode, Matt added he is certified in first aid and about trail etiquette and anything we should keep in mind, while riding. Again, from a rider/client perspective I appreciated knowing we were out with someone who knows the area fluently and if the situation arose, could help and get help. \n\nOn the trail, Matt gave trail info, tips on riding direction, and best routes and also offered riding style and technique tips.\n\nBetween rides Matt loaded/unloaded and broke down and set up bikes and spent time fine tuning sag/ suspension so that the riders would get the full benefit of the bikes they were riding.  \n\nAt the end of the day I was more than satisified with the amount of riding we had done and I got exactly what I wanted - A great guide, who seems like a really good person in general who observed and then showed me the way to the trails that best suited my riding style.  \n\nOutstanding overall experience.  Thank you Matt and thank you Seattle Mountain Bike Tours!"

Since I was visiting from out of town and didn't have my bike or access to a car, the convenience of this service was a necessity. Matt started the trip by getting an idea of my skill level and then we hit the trails. He did a great job of communicating what trail options we had and what to expect on those trails. The day was an absolute blast and completely catered to my riding level. They really did provide great service from the amazing Liv rental bike, to Matt having all the snacks and equipment we might need on the trail, to the provided meals, and the transportation from pick-up to drop-off. Matt was extremely encouraging and made the day super fun! He even indulged my creative side and took some posed (and unposed) photos! I would definitely recommend Seattle Mountain Bike Tours and would love to ride with them again if I'm ever back in Seattle!"

I researched Seattle Mountain Bike Tours and found numerous 5 star reviews so I reached out. They went out of their way to make sure I had the best trip possible. They offer transportation to and from, awesome bikes, equipment, snacks water, and a great guide. My guide Ashley was outstanding. She made sure she found the trails that I was looking for. They have options for any skill level. You can be a total beginner, a wild jumper, a hard core downhiller if the trails exist in the Area they will take you there. Yes the trails around Seattle are amazing. It was truly a wonderful experience. The ride is super affordable the service is top notch. They take away any reason not to go. Definitely book a tour you won't regret it."

        "reviewBody": "I did a day-long ride with guide Nolan on Saturday, August 11 in Snoqualmie.  I am an east coast singletrack rider and this was my first ride in the PacNW.  After picking me up at my hotel in Seattle, we drove to Raging River State Forest.  Nolan made sure the Giant (Anthem, I believe) was properly set up for me, including shock pressure, adjustments to brake angle and reach, and swapping the saddle.  The ride started with a lengthy climb up the mountain and we rode the 18 mile lollipop loop.  Nolan set a strong climbing pace, but he made sure he didn't drop me, and we definitely earned our turns.  The ride down was mostly bermed and flowy until we reached \"No Service,\" where it became steeper with ruts and roots.  Very challenging and exhilarating, especially at speed.  The stats: 18.5 miles, 3,884' vertical.  We stopped for a burrito for lunch and some recovery.  The afternoon ride was at Tiger Mountain where we rode another 6.5 miles with 1275' vert.  I chose to do a shorter ride, Nolan was game for anything I wanted to do.  The climbs were long, but the grades were manageable and everything was rideable.  We had another great ride back down, going through clearings and into thick, dark second growth forests. The bike was great, and Nolan's guidance and knowledge of the trials were priceless!  I highly recommend."
