The kind of movie where the good guys are people that in the real world, you wouldn&apos;t want living next to you, or even sitting next to you on a bus or plane. Even with the great Johnny Depp, and a $5.50 seniors&apos; rate ticket , this movie was almost a total yawn. It was so bad,that the ushers requested that we leave our cell phones on.Or at least I wish."

      "reviewBody": "I agree that George Stevens contribution to Swing time is noteworthy however it is the brilliance of Jerome Kern that truly stands out from this production. Kern&apos;s beautiful melodies:- &apos;Pick Yourself Up&apos;, &apos;A Fine Romance&apos; and the &apos;The Way You Look Tonight&apos;had left an indelible effect on my conscience, because programmers had been clever enough to utilise their qualities in advertisements and TV sitcoms in the UK in the 70&apos;s &amp; 80&apos;s. But when I learnt recently that these numbers all originated from the same production I was surprised.\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing this picture for the first time over the Christmas holidays (2004) and was entranced by the execution of these compositions in their original form. Of course much of the credit goes to Dorothy Field&apos;s lyrics - perfectly delivered by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. No wonder Irving Berlin and George Gershwin also wrote for them. We should remember that Astaire the vocalist is the equal of Astaire the dancer! Notwithstanding Kerns&apos;s melodies - which like Mozart&apos;s piano concertos are pure and simple but undoubtedly the work of a master - it is also the sexual chemistry of Astaire and Rogers that is expertly conveyed by Stevens and far ahead of its time! Forget Mike Nichol&apos;s Closer (2004) it is George Steven&apos;s Swing Time (1936) which suggests the leading players and their companions have an interesting private life and are far nicer people than Closer&apos;s protagonists too!",

But the movie also acknowledges other movies that already have a similar theme. Yes we have Pretty Woman, but Richard Gere also was a man of certain hours (I literally translated the German title of one of his movies).\n\nFor a German comedy this is quite funny. It also has a lot of funny and good actors in it. It also has a couple in it that would later become an onscreen couple again - in a movie series! A bavarian movie series - a great one. Better than the movie right here, but this right here is a different beast - one that I still recommend. If you are into romantic comedies ... and even if it s quite male orientated.",

      "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this movie; I think it might be the best Ferrell movie I&apos;ve seen in a while. Yes it&apos;s goofy and silly, but I think a lot of the negative reviewers here are people who were fans of the original and are judging thru the haze of nostalgia. The original was every bit as goofy and ridiculous, it&apos;s just that this movie has the good sense to acknowledge it. And yes, it may not be appropriate for very young viewers as there is some sexual innuendo and cursing, but it does have a PG-13 rating so I don&apos;t know why you would be dragging young children to it anyways...\n\n&apos;Land of the Lost&apos; starts with a quirky and oddly arrogant scientist, played by Ferrell, claiming to Matt Lauer on &apos;Today&apos; that we can solve our energy problems by tapping into inter-dimensional blah blah blah. Of course, no one believes him but a beautiful student from England (Friel) who convinces him to build his whatsit to open the portal to other dimensions. And of course they soon find themselves trapped in what appears to be a large dumping ground for inter-dimensional portals along with a yokel (McBride). From there it&apos;s just a journey across this strange land to find their way back home.\n\nI realize I&apos;m glossing over a lot of details here but you really don&apos;t need to know them. The whole point is to get a kick out of the satire and broad physical shtick as they encounter the bizarre inhabitants of this world and react to them. If you don&apos;t get too hung up on the logic of it all and just roll with the jokes, I think it&apos;s quite good. And Ferrell, who I have often disliked in previous works because of his tendency to gnaw on the scenery, was reserved enough to deliver a good number of very funny scenes.\n\nIn short, don&apos;t go to this expecting a children&apos;s film, a summer action flick, or something akin to the original. And, as with almost all Ferrell movies, don&apos;t go if you don&apos;t like physical humor. But do go if you are looking for a pleasant hour or two of goofy gags and simple fun.",

It&apos;s not a masterpiece, it&apos;s a simple comedy made by Italians for Italians but occasionally it achieved some international acclaim; many nations have such ones, for example, in former USSR comedies about Shurik adventures (&quot;Operation Y and Other Shurik&apos;s Adventures&quot;, &quot;Prisoner of the Caucasus, or Shurik&apos;s New Adventures&quot;, &quot;Ivan Vasilyevich Changes Occupation&quot;) are cult classic, but not well-known abroad. As for Fantozzi movies - they are very funny sometimes, sometimes silly, but generally good. This satire makes me feel sorry for poor Fantozzi and his poor family (especially his poor daughter), I think it&apos;s too pessimistic.\n\nOf course, it&apos;s much better than most of modern American comedies made by Americans for Americans, which can be seen on our screens because of their big budget (of course, I don&apos;t mean Woody Allen - I&apos;m his fan)."

She moves back home to a small town where she tries to teach and coach a bunch of young girls dancers. Soon enough, they make go on a competition tour.\n\nThe plot is cute and charming. It can be predictable with its story. April lost the big leagues in dancing. And teaches a group of girls that has yet to compete. The girls and April do not easily get along. When the girls are looking up to her. But April is critical. She also runs into her former boyfriend which she ran out on cause she wanted to move to the city. And he stayed in there home town.\n\nThe direction and script is cheesy. With cheesy dialgoue. Can be cringing with its direction. But it tries to have a lot of fun.\n\nSofia Carlson is good with the role. She is fun. Charming. And beautiful.",

      "reviewBody": "In the mid-90s, the disaster movie experienced a revival thanks to the advancement of CGI technology, which made creating scenes of destruction on a massive scale far easier and more convincing than ever before; 1997 was the year of the volcano, seeing both the release of Universal&apos;s Dante&apos;s Peak, and this rather unimaginatively titled effort from 20th Century Fox, which starred Tommy Lee Jones as Office of Emergency Management director Mike Roark, who must try and prevent downtown LA from being entirely engulfed by lava that erupts from the La Brea tar pits.\n\nA slick, major studio, big-budget summer blockbuster, Volcano naturally benefits from a solid cast and state of the art special effects, but proves less thrilling than the premise suggests thanks to a lack of genuinely exciting or particularly innovative set-pieces: too much of the action centres around Jones&apos;s attempts to stem the flow of lava, which travels at walking pace thereby presenting little danger to anyone but the elderly and the infirm; meanwhile, director Mick Jackson ticks off the expected clichés from his disaster movie checklist—personal dramas, heroic sacrifices, a sexy scientist, even a cute dog in peril—before wrapping matters up rather too neatly with a finale that delivers far too low a death toll to be truly satisfying.",

Of course tying bandages in random places doesn&apos;t do anything, but it&apos;s true knowing someone cares do help. This film explores the idea that by healing and understanding other&apos;s pain, you can heal your own.\n\nI usually hate this kind of cheesy Utopian ideas, but it was presented extremely well. The story is very interesting and very well directed. I&apos;ve seen Ishihara Satomi in many TV drama series, but this is by far her best performance (not to mention cute). Although I thought the 2-hour length was a bit too long for this movie and there were couple of cheesy lines, it was a great life-altering film.",

There won&apos;t be many comments  on this one, as it&apos;s virtually unknown, but I&apos;ve looked at  it twice and it brings back a memory of a  movie I loved so much as a  child, though nothing came back to me except the mentioned dancing scene. It&apos;s offbeat, in terrific color and I think enjoyable . Did anybody ever hear of the  dancer  who played the title role again?"

      "reviewBody": "It took me years and years (and also some of my wife&apos;s persistence) to finally appreciate this movie for what it really is: an almost completely absurd, disjointed and surrealistic comedy, owing a lot to Jacques Tati (&quot;Mon Oncle&quot;) and perhaps also to some Laurel &amp; Hardy entries. I am thinking here of those Stan Laurel gags which defy logic, cinematographic or otherwise, which style I recognize here in scenes such as the hysterical one where De Funès &quot;air-plays&quot; some violin bit, which logically only the viewer can hear the in-sync sound of in the soundtrack, then accuses his wife of having actually played this music instead of him, since such things run in HER family I think that viewers who cannot get or appreciate this kind of humor miss the point with this film because it relies a lot on such absurdity. And it is this absurdity which sets it apart uniquely in the De Funès filmography of this specific era.\n\nThe direction and editing superbly serve this style of screenplay – see the scene where De Funès destroys his boats in a tantrum and how he interacts with objects which do not appear to be controlled by any off-camera prop men just by the laws of gravity and the like! The boat chase at the end is also a nice, pleasantly rural/natural relief from the traditional car, plane or chopper chases in some of those other De Funès films, and I love how the gags with the wakes and waves are built and shot!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Fever&quot; is an apt title for a film that does not hold back on passions and continues the streak of wild romanticism that could be seen in a dozen Polish films since the legendary &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot;. The film&apos;s atmosphere is hard to describe, but imagine something in a Byron-meets-Kafka vein: idealistic and highly emotional characters crushed by an omnipresent and invisible dictatorship.\n\nHard-core anarchist, desperately enamored bomber, honest but naive peasant, happy-go-lucky hooligan... None of them is your standard fare good guy, but it is hard not to sympathize with their tragic destiny. Yes, there&apos;s tragedy and Central European gloom all over the place.\n\nThe most terrifying and symbolic sight of the film takes place after a hanging, when a platoon of soldiers starts stomping the ground where they have just buried the poor devil. Funeral march indeed. To drive the point home, a hooligan is continuously whistling that most famous funeral march of all, composed not so surprisingly by Chopin, another Pole.\n\nWhat really surprises me is that I&apos;m the first person writing a comment about this great movie. Polish film buffs, where have you gone?"

What sounds easy is not always and Nick will understand it very soon.\n\nSince I had already watched the second movie &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot; of 2007 before watching this one I knew what to expect so, I had low expectations. Despite that, I did not enjoy it because it was not interesting and it contained many boring scenes. The plot did not make any sense at some points and the direction which was made by Brian Levant was not the best and he did not succeed on creating a familiar feeling in order to relate to his main characters. The interpretations of the cast followed the same pattern as the direction without any surprises or something worth mentioning. In conclusion, I have to say that &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; is a below the average comedy movie and I do not recommend anyone to watch it.",

I searched on Amazon for it and couldn&apos;t find it there. This is one of the funniest movies I ever saw. Danny is doing his usual forged identity. And to add a twist to it, the person he is impersonating has a bad eye and wears a patch, but Danny&apos;s bad eye is the opposite eye and he has to wear a contact in his bad eye so he can cover his good eye. The scene where he drops his contact is priceless. Also, the scene when his aunt (Margaret Rutherford) shows up at a party still makes me laugh just thinking about it. Margaret gives an incredible performance, and Danny is at his funniest. I hope it comes on TV again.",

      "reviewBody": "... Warren William appears to be the whole show. Sure, you have a great supporting cast, but Warren William&apos;s character, tyrannical department store manager Kurt Anderson, is the center of the universe. You dislike his character when you first meet him, but as the film goes along, you begin to understand him and almost pity him by the end of the film. What a brilliant piece of acting.\n\nIt&apos;s one of several films made in the 20s and 30s centered around those giant department stores of New York City with that special brand of humor and pathos that was so unique to Warner Brothers at the time. Kurt Anderson&apos;s curse, besides being completely aware that he would be old and &quot;through&quot; someday just like all of the people that he fired, is to not actually control his empire. He is technically just an employee. He works for the board, for the banks, and the actual owner who seems only good for writing pronouncements for special occasions from his yacht in the Mediterranean.\n\nLoretta Young plays a girl, Madelene, that sleeps with Anderson in order to get a job there - she is starving at the time. Later she develops a romance with Martin West (Wallace Ford), who becomes like a son to Anderson, somebody he is grooming to take over for him someday. The complication is that Martin and Madelene secretly marry because Anderson doesn&apos;t like the idea of married executives - they spend too much time at home. This means that Anderson thinks Madelene is still available, and although Anderson is not the marrying kind, he still finds Madelene desirable. Complications ensue.\n\nAlbert Gran didn&apos;t have too many talking film roles, and in fact this film was released six months after he died. But he is hilarious here as a rather useless executive who Anderson has to keep around because he is related to the actual invisible store owner. Alice White probably has better comic timing here than in any role I&apos;ve seen her as Anderson&apos;s gold digging on-again-off-again mercenary mistress. She is much better as the cherry on top rather than the whole pie.\n\nThe running gag for me? The actual owner of the store - you never see him - always starts his letters by saying he is descended from both James Monroe and Benjamin Franklin. As far as I know there is no such person.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;A Fistful Of Dollars&apos; is a wonderful movie which, despite having an enormous following of fans around the world, sometimes gets unfairly dismissed in my opinion. For two reasons - firstly because the second and third movie in Leone/Eastwood &quot;Man With No Name&quot; trilogy (&apos;For A Few Dollars More&apos; and &apos;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&apos;) are so damn good it&apos;s easy to overlook this one. Despite being made on a much tighter budget and being less ambitious than the sequels to follow, it&apos;s still one of the greatest westerns ever made in my opinion. The second reason is the Yojimbo thing. Now movie buffs frequently slam &apos;A Fistful Of Dollars&apos; as being a rip off of Kurosawa&apos;s &apos;Yojimbo&apos;, which I think is extremely misleading. I&apos;m not disputing that Leone was familiar with Kurosawa (I have no idea one way or the other), but one name I rarely hear ANYONE mention is Dashiel Hammett. Hammett&apos;s hard boiled crime classic &apos;Red Harvest&apos; was published THIRTY YEARS before &apos;Yojimbo&apos; and features the same central premise of an anti-hero playing two rival groups off against each other. So if anyone deserves acknowledgement as uncredited inspiration for Leone (AND Kurosawa) it&apos;s Hammett. Anyway, this is an absolutely brilliant movie and it launched Clint Eastwood, a popular TV actor, into being a major movie star, and likewise put Sergio Leone on the map. I can&apos;t recommend &apos;A Fistful Of Dollars&apos; highly enough, it&apos;s pure entertainment, and very, very cool!"

It is a multi-layered story with some terrific vignettes and the script, cast and performances are all first rate.

One is that a villager was killed in the past by a recruit, so at 23:59 its spirit comes forth. The other is that if a pregnant woman commits suicide, she and her daughter will come to haunt. And the recruits do see spirits. The movie has a group of recruits in training. There is a suicide, and another one dies under mysterious circumstances, so they are on edge. Their Sgt even provides them with talismans and later a medium is brought in. While all the recruits have similar and short haircuts, the Sgt has a very bushy do, and the officer certainly isn&apos;t regulation. That is a detail that should have been trivial to know and fix. The movie is decently done, although if what was shown was reflective of their training, not much of a fighting force. It simply is not that interesting although if one was familiar with the legends, perhaps more so.",

      "reviewBody": "`The Blue Light&apos; tells the story of a small mining village lying in the shadow of an unusual mountain.  During every full moon a blue light issues from the peak, causing young men in the village to take leave of their senses and attempt to climb the mountain in the middle of the night.  This always ends in death for one of the village men.\n\nJunta, a young woman who lives in the hills outside the village, is the only person who has mastered the cliffs, and because of this she is an outcast. One day a stranger arrives in the village, and this man becomes entranced not with the blue light but with Junta.  Eventually, he follows her up the peak and discovers the mountain&apos;s mystery, which Junta has so far kept to herself.  Unlike Junta, though, the stranger cannot keep a secret. A minor catastrophe ensues, signaling simultaneously the doom of Junta and of the modern imagination.\n\nIt seems uncomfortably ironic that the film was both directed by and stars--as Junta--Leni Riefenstahl, the woman who would later become known as `Hitler&apos;s filmmaker,&apos; responsible for some of the most notorious Nazi propaganda films. Nevertheless, `The Blue Light&apos; remains a remarkable achievement for its operatic tone and imagery and for the brilliant mountain climbing sequences.  Junta&apos;s final scene is especially striking, ending in a sequence which blends compelling symbolism with poetic cinematography--a moment worthy of Jean Cocteau.\n\nIn his autobiography, author Robert Aickman noted `The Blue Light&apos; as his favorite film.  He called it a `fable of the post-machine world and of the nature of love.&apos;  Elsewhere Aickman wrote: `Dr. Freud established that only a small part, perhaps one-tenth, of the human mental and emotional organisation is conscious.  Our main response to this discovery has been to reject the nine-tenths unconscious more completely and more systematically than before.&apos;  Junta is one of those rare figures who is in tune with the enigmatic blue light of the unconscious self and open, as well, to that vital emotional reaction to natural beauty.  It is this that makes Junta worth more than a hundred villages filled with greedy mountain-tamers. Perhaps it is no great mystery that a German film like `The Blue Light&apos; should be made as Hitler gained power; insightful expressions of the human soul have always erupted in the most unlikely of times and with the dream thieves following close behind.",

      "reviewBody": "Prisoner is a rough, disturbing little psychological thriller about a potential prison film, or rather the lonely location scouting sessions of controversial, much disliked Hollywood auteur director Derek Plato (Julian McMahon). He&apos;s an arrogant prick of a dude whose newest film has him scouring abandoned penitentiaries for that perfect location. He&apos;s alone, curiously, until all of a sudden... he&apos;s not. Out of nowhere appears the mysterious Jailor (Elias Koteas), a frightening man who forcefully imprisons Plato, mentally berates him and forces the man to look back upon his long and quite unpleasant past in both the film industry and his disaster of a personal life, prodding him with intimate questions and accusations. This is essentially a chamber piece with the two actors being the only ones who appear in the present timeline, which is punctuated by hazy flashbacks to his life before. McMahon carries himself nicely, handling a well worn arc with charisma and giving off an authentically unlikeable vibe early on. Koteas is a beast of an actor and could scare the pants off of real life convicts, as such he steals the show with a brutal, galvanizing performance. Now, these types of films usually head towards conclusions we&apos;ve seen before, and I won&apos;t spoil anything except to say that although I was satisfied with the way the ending did rise up to meet the rest of the film, some won&apos;t be and may find it cliched, but hey, that&apos;s life. Nevertheless, it&apos;s a taut little mind game by way of a character study, clocking in well under ninety minutes, a sleek little piece that leaves the viewer no time to lag or lolly-gag as it trundles along through it&apos;s intense story beats. Cool stuff."

      "reviewBody": "My girlfriend is lucky enough to be on the Screen Actor Guild Awards nominating committee this year, so the promotional DVDs are flowing in, and SIDEWAYS is absolutely the best film we&apos;ve seen so far. (Kinsey is a close second.) Paul Giamatti should get a nomination for this, and I want people on IMDb to start understanding that when you critique a film, it&apos;s not ALL about liking the character-- one IMDBer commenting on this film trashed Sideways because she thought the characters were morally bankrupt, and I challenge all of you to show me a good movie where the main characters aren&apos;t! That&apos;s how the necessary element of conflict is created in a story!\n\nCan you really only enjoy films where the characters in them are people you&apos;d have over for dinner? OPEN YOUR MINDS! Feature Films are not popularity contests, and as far as I&apos;m concerned, neither are awards competitions. Giamatti steals cash from his mother&apos;s bedroom dresser drawer near the beginning of the film. Morally reprehensible? Absolutely! But my heart broke for him when he did it. You could see how much he hated himself in that moment!!! Giamatti&apos;s ability to have intensely personal thoughts flash through his eyes like flickering film through a projector, all the while maintaining such beautiful stillness, was for me breathtaking. Giamatti makes you completely suspend your disbelief...he makes you feel like you have ESP!!!\n\nThomas Hayden Church was hilarious as his ex-college roommate/infantile thirtysomething playboy buddy who can&apos;t let go of &quot;his plight.&quot; He&apos;s a stitch. And I agree with everyone, Virgina Madsen makes you melt in this film. She is scrumptuous. Remember, IMDb moralists,...people who live in glass movie-houses, shouldn&apos;t throw popcorn! ~peace"

      "reviewBody": "A shikara sits on a still lake, the beauty of Kashmir resplendent in the background, a hazy mist clutching the mountains; it is quiet, calm, still. The stillness is shattered by an explosion, the Shikara is in flames to the strains of &quot;dhuan dhuan&quot; in the background, as if to reiterate the point of a burning Kashmir, once a stunning land, now ravaged by repression and terrorism, eaten by fear, divided by politics in the name of religion.... ...This movie is not a stereotype bollywood movie,its a mixture of an art movie &amp; a commercial movie,a battle between love &amp; hatred...MK is a DIFFERENT BRICK IN THE WALL..Technically, the film is on par with any Hollywood film with a bombastic climax....It truly gives a picture of the beauty of kashmir &amp; its culture.I know some people feel it has not done that well despite huge commercial expectations at the box office.. but it turned out to be an international blockbuster, ranking among the top 50 rentals in the US and dubbed into most major languages around the world.Mission Kashmir is not an ordinary movie,even Hollywood can feel ashamed in front of such an extraordinary masterpiece with cutting-edge cinematic techniques and state-of-the-art sound direction. ,it is easily one of the finest Hindi films ever with flawless direction, mesmerizing locations, pleasant music,hi-fi special effects and some stunning performances by almost everyone in the cast, this really makes for a great movie experience.Vidhu Vinod Chopra captures the essence of Kashmir so beautifully that by the end of the movie you actually start feeling proud to have such a heavenly place in your country.The movies raises a hope that after all the mishaps that&apos;s going in kashmir, there will be peace. after the dark, there will be a morning. and love and peace will en cover the Kashmir. the Dal lake will again be filled with heavenly water replacing the live explosives.. The climax of the movie was the best climax I have seen in this genre..,the fight sequence,especially the technique... of Normal and Slow motion shots syncronised with sound... This end sequence would have been less than seen without that great artwork (Old and almost ruined wooden house with lifelike cobwebs and not to forget the swamps),.....excellent cinematography,innovative camera work,beautiful sets and awesome action sequences(one of the best in world cinema)makes this movie an unforgettable classic.The location in the climax shot at the dal lake was mind-blowing,the scene in which the lotus sub-merged was a true portrayal of kashmir under terrorism.Its a realistic movie dealing with terrorism,the weak point is confusing story line if you don&apos;t follow it properly &amp; secondly some songs were not required to be there during some parts of the movie.Hrithik was awesome in the movie so as Sanjay and every other actor,Jackie Shroff who was once tortured by the Soviets in Afghanistan now runs a jihad against India funded by two shadowy agents and, behind them an equally shadowy Osama bin Laden look-alike. Indians should learn to praise such a gem movie instead of copying Hollywood flicks.Mission Kashmir is a masterpiece which can not be made again and again,if it would have been an American movie,it would have surely won the Oscar.Vidhu Vinod Chopra has made a cracker of a film, weaving together an intelligent and responsible film, blending and balancing big action with emotion and feeling, almost perfectly. MK is not just about bombs ,missiles &amp; guns,it also has flowers,beautiful shikaras,excellent music,religion,innocence,love &amp; romance.If you are a typical masala movie lover,this one is not for you but if you have the creativity and an artistic eye this one is a must watch for you....! Mission Kashmir is a realist yet artistic portrayal of terrorism and strife in... it is truly a patriotic movie must watch for every Indian,....a dedication to Kashmiriyat, the centuries old tradition of religious tolerance and harmony..!",

A good adult actress and even though she didnt have any other scenes in the movie she played a big part in it.  Nikki by far though was the top blonde.  A killer body with extreme talent.  Chloe has a couple of good scenes too.",

A movie along the same lines as &apos;Mega Shark&apos; and the like. The animation is a problem I can accept in these low budget films, however a half reasonable storyline is something I cannot go without and i&apos;m sorry but this film doesn&apos;t have one. The acting isn&apos;t bad, giving it the edge over its rival films. Therefore if you must watch one, make it this, however I would recommend you lift a good book (or a poor one for that matter) or get an early night. It would be a much more useful way to pass the time. You can thank me later.",

It has a very good cast made up of seasoned Norwegian actors (including the writer himself, Andre Bjerke), and the plot is very good acted out. Now, it would be really unfair to compare Norwegian films made in the 1950&apos;s with their Hollywood counterparts then and now - they were made on very tight budgets and usually played for a limited audience. However, this film (made in creepy black and white) has some outstanding scenes that made me (at least) really very uneasy. It&apos;s really a very good attempt to make an exiting movie out of a brilliant psychological thriller novel. I think it still - even by today&apos;s standard - has a very high entertainment value, just as it had about 50 years ago. No CGI effects here - just good, solid acting!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I want to know everything I would know if he was still alive. I want more memories of him.&quot;\n\nAfter their teenage son Bennett (Aaron Johnson) dies in an accident, Allen and Grace (Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon) are left unable pick up the pieces and move on after his death. But when the young woman (Carey Mulligan) who&apos;s carrying Bennett&apos;s unborn baby arrives at their doorstep with nowhere else to go, the tension and pain of Bennett&apos;s death is brought forward in a way that will either destroy the family, or finally push them towards dealing with their grief. Scenes of Rose and Bennett&apos;s relationship before his death are also woven throughout the movie, and provide a nice way to better know the two characters.\n\nThe Greatest started off pretty well. The scenario of a family struggling with the loss of a child isn&apos;t an uncommon one, but the cast seemed well on their way to delivering a solid story about loss and healing. Mulligan was excellent, and Brosnan and Sarandon were solid, even though they occasionally didn&apos;t quite deliver the emotion that they were reaching for in a few scenes. No, my problem with The Greatest wasn&apos;t the actors or the premise, it was the writing.\n\nThe story takes the oddest detours at times, often with little relevance to, well...the actual story. This really seemed apparent with the character of Ryan, whose entire subplot with the girl he meets has little relevance on his character arc, and made his resolution feel artificial, as a result. And Rose and Allen&apos;s trip to a teenage party seemed completely out of place, and I was left wondering what it was supposed to add to the story. The characters also didn&apos;t appear to have a truly solid identity, and as a result, some of their decisions and interactions didn&apos;t come off as genuine. It&apos;s like writer and director Shana Feste had ideas about what she wanted to see happen in the movie, but didn&apos;t bother to build those ideas around relatable and believable characters. A movie like this depends on making a connection between the audience and the characters, and at times, that connection felt very hollow, for me.\n\nThe Greatest is an okay movie, but I&apos;m convinced that it could have been much better with a script written by someone with a better grasp on creating solid characters.",

It is all wink wink - fully aware of what it is and way more on the fun side than the first movie, that tried to be quite serious. It even has a few cameos that work really nice.

First, IMHO, there are lot of miscast in this movie. Characters are played without enough passion. Leading role (Phantom himself) is played emotionless - without face expression, without stress or anger or joy. What will feel the driver when is chased by dozen of police cars? Will he remain silent, expressionless and dumb? I doubt so! Also, chief of police is played not good enough - like he is some fruit-seller on the market. All chase-scenes were shot in the dark, pretending we see Belgrade in 1979! But still we can see street signs, exchange-office sign from modern times! Also, Phantom wears bad copy, clearly visible, of &quot;ADIDAS&quot; sport-shoes, with 4 stripes ! That was such mistake! Real ADIDAS is with 3 stripes, and in late 70&apos;s there were easy to buy original Adidas shoes in every shoe-shop! That was big mistake. Well, I really like beginning of the movie, with scenes taken from real documentaries, but lately, everything went sloppy. I gave 2/10 just because I like scenes taken from documentaries.",

      "reviewBody": "First and foremost let me clarify all the bias and ignorant, yet frequent, comments that are swirling around &quot;The Carter&quot;: this film does not glorify Lil Wayne. Period. What it DOES glorify, however, is his addictive and downright inhuman work ethic. The man does not stop...ever. Recording over 1000 songs in the year 2008 alone is a perfect example of his constantly-creating lifestyle, in which he somehow manages to raise an adorable (and loving) daughter, all while forever-high off his choice of drugs: Promethazine syrup and lots and lots of marijuana. It is inarguable that Wayne is far from a normal, functioning human being...and if that isn&apos;t an engaging film premise, I don&apos;t know what is.\n\nThe film begins with montages of Wayne recording songs in his tour bus and hotel room, places that only HE manages to make music in. It&apos;s safe to say that, along with Wayne himself, his manager Cortez Bryant is the &quot;narrator&quot; of the film, sharing his opinions and love for the artist through interviews and footage of his constant phone-calling and dollar sign negotiations.\n\nThe film is very &quot;Tyson&quot;-esque in the sense that you are brought into the mind of this bizarre individual by the individual himself. When asked the question &quot;What would you do if you were President?&quot;, he answers &quot;I would put cocaine back into Coca-Cola, I would legalize marijuana first AND second. Then I would eliminate all drug-use laws in sports: if you wanna take steroids, that&apos;s cool with me...as long as you playin&apos; good.&quot; You can&apos;t help but laugh at the sheer foolishness of the man&apos;s comments, however Wayne has no shame in being downright immature; this is HIS world that he&apos;s explaining. We just all live in it.\n\nAs &quot;The Carter&quot; dives into his self-destruction drug addictions, we see a darker side of the artist, a side that his manager barely even comments on for he is &quot;too heartbroken to see him like that.&quot; Once again, no one in Wayne&apos;s extensive clique of assistants and errand-runners support or enjoy his addiction...and he doesn&apos;t expect them too. &quot;Who gives a f--k what I&apos;m drinking or what I do or what&apos;s in my cup? It&apos;s in MY cup!&quot; This is practically common sense to Lil Wayne, confused as to why everyone cares what he does. He&apos;s going to do it either way, whether we like it or not. We might as well all just accept it now.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t shove anything in your face or add unnecessary melodrama. It doesn&apos;t portray the addicted martian-like rapper as an icon or role model whatsoever. It simply takes you for a ride into the world and mentality of Lil Wayne, such a bizarre, conceited, and uncomfortable place that it is ultimately somewhat of a wonder. This film exposes us to the real Lil Wayne, one of the most interesting characters ever put on video.",

      "reviewBody": "It is set in a near future with testosterona macho men and based on the classic movie by Paul Bartel, but here adding much more action and violence. It deals with a thief called Lucas, Luke Goss, who is assigned by his chief, Sean Bean, to carry out a bank heist, but it goes wrong and then he is locked in a maximum security prison at Terminal island. There is developed a thrilling race in which the skillfull driver Lucas accompanied by a gorgeous copilot, Tanit Phoenix Copley, participate at the exciting and amazing race contending with other heinous and bloody participants. The race is televised by pay per view and presented by a beautiful host, Lauren Cohen, and Luke is given an opportunity, if Lucas wins 5 races, to have a big reward: to be freed. As he attempting to survive the perilous competition by pitting other inmates to get an early release.\n\nThis is a run-of-the-mill prequel, a high-octane guilty, grindhouse reboot pleasure. This Death Race follow-up exploring the origin of the violent race called Death Race, it is the ultimate sporting where contestants get score point for running drivers down, a futurist international sport with plenty of violence where the pilots contend for hitting other vehicles, but it is also a predictable fare with familiar scenes and non-sense plot . Not as brilliant but no worse than previous and successive entries. It is made in brainless and rudimentary masculine fashion filled with macho men and sexy, provocative and wonderful girls. It is a tightly packed film with noisy action, fights, car crashes, twists and turns. Stirring and surprising script written by Paul Anderson, who produced too, he formerly directed Death Race with Jason Statham and he also made Resident evil, Soldier, Event horizon , Alien vs Predator and Mortal combat\n\nThe picture was professionally directed by Raoul Reine, but it doesnt reach nowhere near he satirical impact and playfulness of the original movie. Followed by other sequels with similar technician and artistic team. Raoul Reine has directed various Tv series as Black sails, Wu assassin, Knighfall, Redball legend, Inhumans and some films, such as : The Admiral, The lost tribe, The bear. Raoul is an expert on sequels such as : Hard taget 2, The condemned 2, The man with the iron fist, 12 rounds 2, Seal team eight, Redbad, The Marine 2.\n\nThis film is based on the original Death race 1975 also produced by Rogen Corman directed by Paul Bartel with Sylvester Stallone, David Carradine, Simone Griffith. Followed by Death race 2oo8 by Paul W. S. Anderson with Jason Statham, Tyrese Gybson, Jacob Vargas, Joan Allen, Natalie Martinez. Death race Inferno with Luke Goss, Tanit Phoenix, Dougray Scott, Frederick Koehler, Robin Shou. Death race 4 Beyond anarchy with Lucy Aarden, Nicholas Aaron. There is also another film titled Death Race 73 by David Lowell Rich with Lloyd Bridges, Roy Thinnes, Eric Braeden, but it nothing to do with the saga produced by Roger Corman. Rating 6/10 a really indescribably violent action movie.",

      "description": "Set in the very near future, the United States economy begins to decline and violent crime starts to spiral out of control. To contain the growing criminal population, a vast network  of for-profit, private prisons springs up, creating a lawless subculture ruled by gangs, cold-blooded killers and sociopaths. The worst of these prisons is Terminal Island, where inmates fight each other in a highly rated televised death match, where there are no rules, and the winner is the one who survives the gladiator-style, no-holds-barred competition. Convicted cop-killer Carl Lucas (Luke Goss) arrives on the Island to serve his life sentence just as ruthlessly ambitious television personality September Jones evolves the death match into the ultimate reality show Â– Death Race. A brutal prison yard demolition derby that pits prisoners against each other in steel reinforced, heavily armed vehicles, Death Race offers the winner the ultimate prize: freedom Â— if he can survive to enjoy it.",

      "reviewBody": "The English duo of Nicholas Hytner and Alan Bennett last collaborated on 1994&apos;s Oscar and BAFTA winning THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE. This 2006 collaboration abbreviates Bennett&apos;s own 2004 Royal National Theatre play into a fast- moving account of how a group of Yorkshire teenagers from a state school pass the now defunct Oxford/Cambridge entrance exam. This is England in 1983. It&apos;s the zenith of Thatcherism. It was also the year of the film EDUCATING RITA, in which a working class housewife betters herself through an Open University degree. Things have obviously changed in the country since the Victorian times of Thomas Hardy&apos;s JUDE THE OBSCURE, where university is not a thing for the working class.\n\nBut the social, political and cultural milieu of the era is kept in the background (it&apos;s much less evocative than THIS IS ENGLAND, made the same year and also set in 1983). This is as much a fantasy of education as DEAD POET&apos;S SOCIETY. These are classes full of the expectational, bright and articulate. Bennett never really finds the authentic voice of the 18-year olds - they speak the words of older, wiser men. But the performances - Richard Griffiths, Stephen Campbell Moore and Frances De La Tour as the teachers tutoring them in various ways towards university and, amongst other a pre-stardom Domonic Cooper and James Corden as the students - are uniformly excellent. The dialogue is witty in its observations on the education system and the purpose of education. Bennett&apos;s own adaptation wisely drops the two flashes forward which opened the play&apos;s first and second acts (Campbell Moore&apos;s character as a TV historian in the present day).",

With each song that is feature you hear a different accent it&apos;s like they couldn&apos;t stick with the right ones\n\nThe costumes look like they were just half made and just put on the actors with no attempt to make it work and it is clearly low budget this direct to video release \n\nNow this is when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were very popular this video however was not one of the Turtles&apos; better ideas plus most of the songs make you go what were they thinking \n\nNow a song or two is so corny that is actually listening to it that makes you go wow \n\nOnly check it out if you&apos;re curious other than that it&apos;s shell shocked",

Reading the film credits before writing this review I learned that Kuffs was written specifically for Slater. I can&apos;t see anyone else this role of George Kuffs, amiable high school dropout who can&apos;t get his life together and is sponging off his big brother Bruce Boxleitner.\n\nBoxleitner is a patrol specialist, an institution dating from the days of the Forty Niners and unique unto San Francisco. There were not enough police to enforce any semblance of law and order in a town that just mushroomed over night. The city fathers assigned specific areas to people to enforce law and order and Boxleitner has one of those districts.\n\nBut in his area, the merchants are being harassed and extorted and he&apos;s being offered a huge bribe to sell his district to some really nasty people. When he doesn&apos;t Boxleitner is killed and Christian Slater inherits his job. \n\nDespite some really gaping holes in the plot, the film is really carried along quite nicely by Christian Slater. Others in the cast of note are Milla Jovavich as his pregnant girlfriend, Leon Rippy as the hood who murdered Boxleitner and Tony Goldwyn as the SFPD officer assigned to Slater to keep him from getting killed.\n\nStill Kuffs is strictly a Christian Slater show and his fans will absolutely love it.",

      "reviewBody": "After the success with Top gun in 1984, there was very few who tried to repeat that success, one was hot shot that was a parody of top gun 1990, the other is this Japanese movie from the same year, great acting as always in Japanese movies and great drama but it feels like it was a long commercial of Japanese jet fighter and yes that was intended.\n\nA pilot callsigned Goku is attending flight academy to become ranked Best Guy, he has other pilots opponents, Duck and Imagine. Imagine doesn&apos;t like Goku because he dares to take risks and is too stubborn. Their leader callsigned Zombie tolerate Goku because he recognized himself in him. Then a lady director named Miyuki break a movie commercial she was intended to make with a Canadian singer and to make a scoop with the pilots, specially Goku.\n\nThe movie is very interesting drama, and the acting is great but it also a little boring when it comes to flights. When the movie was released it flopped in Japanese cinema and I can see why, but at the same time the movie has a lot of nice moments specially the scene when Miyuki and Goku run to each other and hug at the big fountain.",

The story cuts to the chase in a way that is refreshing (see the scene where Lilly and Dan go outside at the wedding). The leads are all appealing, especially Danny Nucci and Paula Marshall as an unlikely duo and Bette Midler and Dennis Farina, who are evidently having a fabulous time.\n\nThis is just flat out enjoyable and well-written, the way a lot of comedies were in the golden days of Hollywood. And like those great classic comedies, this is not a sappy sentimental story with any false nobility. People admit to not being perfect. They don&apos;t try to be anything they&apos;re not - or if they do they are quickly deflated.\n\nThe underlying theme is &quot;be true to yourself and don&apos;t get sucked into the boring b.s. of life.&quot; This is the kind of subversive edge that the great screwballs had, right down to including a pompous wannabe politician and a gold-digging second wife.\n\nBravo. If only they&apos;d make more like this. How about a sequel or the same team coming back together for another project?",

      "name": "SMALL TOWN, BIG HORROR",
      "reviewBody": "Horror anthology about a cursed small town, beset by multiple grotesque murders over its history. The first is one of the best: A lovelorn elderly man charged with his equally elderly sister, who suffers from dementia. In clumsy pursuit of a to-die-for coworker, he, instead, turns the tables and kills her, with wild repercussions I won&apos;t reveal, other than it involves a Cousin-of-Chucky doll. Most impressive is the motif of the old man picking at a block of ice for his sister&apos;s bath, hacking it over and over, every stab expressing an ever growing, never-ending sense of frustration, futility and disgust. The second is a Hammeresque Freak Show, hosting a rogue&apos;s gallery of characters straight out of Todd Browning. All do their parts very well, but the Gypsy Queen Directress--She Who Will Be Obeyed--reigned Supreme for me. And there is a splatter-lovers&apos; fest that will make said lovers festive! Third is about a man who has found the secret to eternal life through voodoo A gift that is his to have and his to give, for good or evil, and for the crook on the lam he took in, and who then betrayed him, the gift was a long life of tortured horror.. The final being almost a movie unto itself about how war breaks down all social conventions and the most fundamental human values, set in a settlement of Confederate orphan children, all adults having been casualties of war, who band together in a version of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; social order. Despite word that the war was over, a group of renegade Union soldiers still want to rape and pillage wantonly, in pursuit of which they stumble upon the children&apos;s settlement, and are immediately set upon by the not-so-innocent babes, who subject the men to such gruesome tortures, I&apos;m sure, if they could think through the excruciating pain and horror, they&apos;d wish they had gone home at the armistice. This sequence in particular, so much lit so beautifully by ritualistic firelight, effectively contrasted with the drab, grey monotony of smoky, feeble daylight, but art direction, cinematography, stellar throughout. Hosted by Vincent Price in his typically revered avuncular elder role.",

He has a family and lives in peace, but is suddenly shot in a serious hit. Charly is shot 22 times but, amazingly, survives. After the hit and recovery, the scarred ex-mafioso is thirsty for a bloody revenge. What follows is an intense, action-packed and bloody thriller.\n\nThe story is quite simple and The Immortal definitely has it&apos;s flaws, but overall it is an awesome ride. Jean Reno is back on track in this great French production. The Immortal may not be as good as Un Prophet but could definitely become a cult classic like the first Boondock Saints. 7/10",

Then again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect.  I believe this is the first A-PIX sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future:  more A-PIX sequels.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which Jack Frost&apos;s offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it.  They are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say looks very cheesy.  The computer animation surprised me, as the first &quot;Jack Frost&quot; had no such effects.\n\nI&apos;d strongly recommend that you see the original &quot;Jack Frost&quot; before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense (&quot;sense&quot; being a relative term).\n\nNow only if there was &quot;Uncle Sam 2&quot;...",

      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m a Cronenberg fan since I haven&apos;t seen many of his movies and those that I have seen consists largely of his later works. I also can&apos;t say that stereo was the kind of movie I was expecting, since the topic hasn&apos;t been the most popular subject in those movies that can be considered to contain any individuality. I wasn&apos;t badly disappointed or gladly surprised because this movie was indeed a bit rough. Still the subject and Cronenbergs approach to it feels quite fresh. Filming takes place in an architecturally interesting building complex. The building is filmed from inside and outside, but in any shots no other buildings can be seen. This gives a nice enigmatic touch on the setting.\n\nI found it surprising how this movie tried to combine sexual behavior and pseudo scientific telepathy by using scientific biological and psychological approaches. The film doesn&apos;t try in any point to explain how telepathy is actually achieved, but instead feeds the viewer with supposedly scientific data that is related to telepathy (for example. functions on how strength of telepathic linkage is correlated on the distance of two telepathic persons, how emotions affect telepathy etc.). Things told by the narrator are related to the images on the screen. He explains how emotions, such as love, are manipulated in an scientific experiment, as a method on gathering information about telepathy. There is no soundtrack, dialog or SFX, only the narrators voice. The fact that all that is happening on the screen is explained in scientific terms/reasoning, without any scientific justification, might make the &quot;story&quot; a little tough piece to swallow.\n\nTime to time the movie doesn&apos;t seem to progress very rapidly: There are some long scenes where expressions are extensively filmed and some of them are almost funny (for example when one subject very slowly raises his hand to his mouth while looking straight forward and one scene where man is eating a chocolate bar, seem to last for an eternity). As the movie is carried forward by the narrator, the scenes where he is silent are completely quiet. I don&apos;t consider this helpful while trying to keep audience interested on the subject. Since visual part of this movie can&apos;t by itself tell much to audience and is better left on the background to be explained by the narrator. This sure isn&apos;t a mainstream movie and it is also a rare piece in it&apos;s subject and style. I certainly don&apos;t regret watching this, but as a word of warning, it might not be too easy to watch. However this movie wasn&apos;t made just to entertain audience, as later works by Cronenberg and despite low entertainment value, it is one of the most interesting movies I have seen from him. If this one feels too heavy to watch, check out &apos;The Fly&apos; (as you probably already have), though I liked &apos;Naked Lunch&apos; the best.",

      "reviewBody": "Phir Subah Hogi (1958) : Brief Review -\n\nA dramatic Indian adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky&apos;s novel minus criminology features. Dostoevsky&apos;s novel, Crime and Punishment, has been adapted on screen many times and was perfectly suitable for the criminal activities in America and the UK. However, the Indian setup of crime was different, and so the adaptation needed many changes. Ramesh Saigal&apos;s Phir Subah Hogi did exactly that. He added several Indian dramatic motions and conflicts that are accessible to mass audiences despite their dark theme. Our Indian audiences weren&apos;t very familiar with such dark crime noirs at the time, and yet Phir Subah Hogi turned out to be a commercially successful film. That&apos;s indeed notable. Making such a movie a box office hit must have been so difficult (and it is difficult even today). So, kudos to the team and the audiences too for showing a slight shift in the mainstream mindset. Phir Subah Hogi has many changes from the original novel, with the main change being that there are no mother and sister&apos;s characters here. The protagonist isn&apos;t a successful criminology author either. We have Ram, an intelligent LLB student who doesn&apos;t have money for his studies. He falls in love with Soni and then commits murder to save her from a disastrous marriage. As expected, his conscience starts eating him, and the police officer keeps taunting him with his criminological tricks until he finally surrenders himself. The speech Ram gives in front of the judge in the climax scene is another additional change-for the better only. Some songs are really meaningful and good, while others, which appear in the second half, go mostly flat. Raj Kapoor, Mala Sinha, Rehman (extended role), and Mubarak&apos;s performances lift the film further. Ramesh Saigal and Mubarak&apos;s writing misses a couple of must-be-there metaphors; rest assured, it&apos;s a fine script and a nice film considering contemporary mainstream cinema.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

George Nader is frequently bumping into something and has a lot of funny lines to say. He is obviously the stupid counterpart of his other role at this time, FBI agent &quot;Jerry Cotton&quot;. \n\nA big problem in enjoying this beautiful fun is however, that most available versions present this (shot in 2,35:1-Scope) film in shitty fullscreen transfers, so you can see only half of the real image and missing much important picture information on both sides, so you sometimes can hardly tell what&apos;s going on. \n\nI&apos;m sure, the day this finally will be released in a decent OAR-transfer the film will win a lot of admirers!",

He has precious little acting ability but would have been great rolling around in a loin cloth, or swinging through the trees with a knife between his teeth. Well, to be fair to that image - it&apos;s sort of what he ends up doing here in this very routine spaghetti western. He is &quot;Clyde&quot; who is charged with pinching an huge gold consignment being held by the Yankee army during the American civil war. Allied with half a dozen pretty disparate cutthroats and an even more duplicitous union captain &quot;Lynch&quot; (Frank Wolff) we now follow their escapades as betrayal begets betrayal and killings become routine as they search for the loot. It&apos;s all very cheap, cheerful and predictable - and Connors must have a jaw made of wrought iron. Francesco De Masi is no Ennio Morricone so we haven&apos;t even a quirky or original score to rely on to help this as it limps along to a denouement that matters not. The production - especially the editing - is really basic, but it might have worked better had the cast, dialogue and story been a bit more robust. As it is, though, well it just passes the time, that&apos;s all.",

However they are branded nerds and, when the jocks burn their own dorm down, the nerds find themselves kicked out and forced to sleep in the gym.  When the nerds form their own chapter of the Tri-Lam fraternity. When they are bullied continually they decide to take matters into their own hands and fight back with the Jock&apos;s own games.\n\nIf there&apos;s one genre in the world that I hate it&apos;s the American college jock/nerd comedy.  Whether it be the Animal House or Porky&apos;s or more modern ones  I hate almost all of them!  So when I watched this I watched it with a certain fear.  However the plot makes redresses the balance by having us support the nerds!  It&apos;s well plotted so that it isn&apos;t just them becoming just like the jocks but instead learning their own lessons.  Of course it is rude at times and does fall into being just silly and slapstick, but it&apos;s mixed nicely with some good sentiment and more gentle laugh.\n\nThe cast is great (in retrospect).  Anthony Edwards is a real surprise in this post-ER time.  Likewise Busfield is strange after 30-something and West Wing.  Less so but Moonlighting&apos;s Curtis Armstrong is funny to see.  And lets not forget James Cromwell (or Jamie as he was called then!), John Goodman and black 1970&apos;s star Bernie Casey!  The nerds are all good  rising above their caricatures to start to bring out characters.\n\nOverall this is a spin on the frat-comedy so it is a little juvenile and silly but the fact that it is spun towards the nerds makes it that little bit refreshing to watch compared to so many where our `heroes&apos; are arrogant, annoying jock-types who sponge off mummy and daddy just to get drunk at college.  Not a great movie but much better than anything else post-Animal House - I&apos;m with the nerds!"

Direction, editing, writing-- all are uninspired, especially the occasional attempts at humor.\n\nBut the casting is atrocious. Desperately bad. So clean-cut he almost squeaks, Keir Dullea is at no point convincing as a gambling, carousing womanizer. Buddy Ebsen adds nothing new-not one glance, not one inflection-- to the tiresomely familiar role of the wise, slow-spoken, solitary old-timer.\n\nIn the eponymous role, Lois Nettleton stares soulfully toward Ebsen, Dullea, or the near distance. That&apos;s about it. Refreshing though it is to see a rather plain actress as a star, she finds no way to redeem-with humor, with spirit-- a woman who has almost no curiosity about her sight-unseen future mate and his home. In fact, objectively, her non-reaction is almost criminally irresponsible for a widow with a child.",

But, typically for Altman, it&apos;s the deconstruction of the genre that he&apos;s interested in, not the genre itself.  This movie isn&apos;t about a murder in a country house; it&apos;s a movie about class differences and people connecting (or not connecting) with one another.\n\nIt seems futile to mention stand out performances in a film filled to the rafters with stand-out performances, but I did especially like Emily Watson as a cheeky maid, Helen Mirren as the &quot;perfect servant,&quot; and Kelly MacDonald as the novice lady&apos;s attendant who grows more than anyone else over the course of the film.\n\nThe film is at its best when it&apos;s probing the emotional depths of the story---it comes across as a bit too glib when the satire gets especially acidic (mostly with the Kristin Scott Thomas character), but like the best of his movies (&quot;Nashville,&quot; &quot;M*A*S*H,&quot; &quot;Short Cuts&quot;) Altman knows how to control his own cynicism and doesn&apos;t let sarcasm rule.\n\nWith his on again-off again track record, we can expect the next Altman film to tank, so let&apos;s enjoy this one while we can."

      "reviewBody": "I was excited to see a screening of this in the MoMA. Although far different from his first three films and lacking in their youthfulness, it offered several vivid themes. First I will say he is one of the finest actors directors I&apos;ve ever seen, comparable to America&apos;s Sidney Lumet in how he hands the reins to performers to light the screen, and creates these pleasing compositions to just watch the actors work.\n\nThis film is really about manhood. Think of a cowboy and his horse. A samurai and his sword. A fisherman and his boat. I swear at some points it feels like it&apos;s about an aged samurai, but in this modern melodramatic setting.\n\nA director must cinematically fetishize his subject. It just depends what he chooses, here the boating, the fishing. I am seeing it as his sexual frustration. While land is so subdued. The ocean is a wild animal.\n\nThere is a whole gay subtext how these men seem only impotent with women, coming alive at sea and nearly getting killed. Look at the extended love scene is just them smushing each other in a dull way. Then the guy shows up and they fight, and the sparklers go off behind him. Now he is turned on. Or how muted the boy is to the daughter, until the rape scene that is only in the context of her father disapproving his fishing ability.\n\nEvery scene with the boats are electric. Every scene on land is melancholic.\n\nFunnily, the early scenes, this idea of manic Japanese people alone in sea desperate to find tuna, were amusing. The film is far weightier than this though to the point of a slight pretentiousness. I feel I have seen this movie already in that sense, you would expect this story on TV somewhere; although not even close to the melodrama and craziness it achieves.",

The total contrary of the Russian, US or British films. His masterpiece is the movie about Stalingrad battle (Dogs do you want to live forever?), that I have commented, or this other one about U Boats ( Sharks and Small Fish). This one shows the inside of a SS school. This is definitely an anti war drama, showing a murder mystery classic yarn, but the main purpose is to denounce the real goal of this SS school, destined to purchase cannon fodder to the front, a school where a crime is commited. But the subject is also oriented towards the Gestapo point of view; how will it manage this delicate problem inside the institution? There was the same problem several years ago in France where a cadet in Saint Cyr prestigious military school died in mysterious circumstances, drills, hazing, or killed by another cadet.... The case was rapidly put under silence by the authorities. Back to this film, it is very rare and worth watching too.",

I may even track down the unrated version, which is two minutes longer.\n\nHow Director Frank Henenlotter kept everyone on the same page here is a mystery. No one stood out for (inappropriately) bad acting. The weird set pieces and oddball props work great. There is a nice progression from bizarre low-key humor to complete absurdity. It&apos;s really well constructed.\n\nI happily give this six (6) stars.\n\nPS Patty Mullen is a poster child for a blonde who IMHO looks better with black hair.",

To do so he purchases a pair of suitcase nukes from arms dealer Hardy Kruger and makes alliance with a Mid Eastern terrorist Henry Silva.\n\nThere&apos;s a presidential election involved as incumbent George Grizzard tries to show himself as tough as the office demands, especially those demands voiced by former President Leslie Nielsen who is trying to do a Grover Cleveland and return to the White House. \n\nThe Twin Towers of New York actually play a role here so a faithful remake isn&apos;t possible. The end is right out of Duck Soup. Besides those mentioned I enjoyed Rosalind Cash as the Vice President, G.D. Spradlin as the harassed CIA head, and Robert Conrad with the Dickensian name of General Wombat.\n\nHe and Connery share the climax in an ending superb and sublime.\n\nThis one is a sleeper, check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "Today both  Hervey Allen and his novel, Anthony Adverse, are all but forgotten, as is the 1936 Mervyn Leroy adaptation. Allen has never been granted  a biography or a critical study( one could also say the same thing about Mervyn Leroy) while both the novel and the film are dismissed as over blown, prolix &quot;white elephants&quot;. This is not entirely fair. Allens 1200 page colossus was the greatest best seller of its day, and was only surpassed when Margaret Mitchell wrote Gone With The Wind, while Leroys film isn&apos;t bad. In fact it is pretty good, in its own way. First of all, Leroy managed to condense Allens erudite, baroque epic into the space of a two -hour, black and white film. In doing so, he managed to retain most of the novels elaborate religious symbolism( Allen seems to have been either a Lapsed, but still affectionate Catholic or an Episcopalian of the &quot;high church &quot; variety with a fascination with Priests, The Virgin Mary, and Crucifixion symbols), all of the colorful characters( Allen seems to have ransacked Tolstoy, Dickens, Dumas, and Balzac for ideas.), and most of the action.( the carriage chase in the Alps is one of the great &quot;scenes&quot; of thirties cinema). The film has also retained the novels plot, or most of it. One would not know, for example, that the hero ends up dying rather UNheroically in Texas sometime in the early eighteen twenties, or that the book has a truly bizarre, ambiguous epilogue in which &quot;white trash&quot; settlers of Texas from Missouri stumble across the statuette of the virgin and the ruins of Adverses  estate.The great problem with the book -and with the film- is that Anthony Adverse is NOT a heroic figure. He is played upon, not player, a passive, frequently humiliated victim of adversity. Clearly, Allen wanted to make him a philosophical hero, not a swashbuckler. He is a clerk, for heavens sake. Most of the time, he is engaged in capitalist transactions of some sort, instead of sword-play. ( indeed, the only sword- play in the movie is between the villainous Don Luis and Anthony&apos;s father.)The basic action is simple. One Priest gives Anthony a mind,by teaching him. Another gives him a soul, by reminding him that slavery is a sin( Incidentally, the film is a powerful indictment of slavery and racism). Finally, Olivia De Havillands character gives him a heart, by introducing him to the son he never knew he had. March-a very fine actor at his best- seems curiously flat and passive in the role of Adverse. The truly great performances are by Claude Rains and Gale Sondergaard as the over the top super-villains. Rains exhudes decadence, arrogance and sadism, while Sondergaard won the first best supporting actress Oscar, simply by grinning satanically for two hours.",

      "reviewBody": "Summer camp caretaker Cropsy is fire roasted when some pranksters try to scare him with a flaming skull. Five years later, after numerous failed skin grafts, Cropsy is released back into society with a horribly scarred face and even more scarred psychological make-up. Now he&apos;s got a bone to pick and returns to the same camp of his accident (after gutting a hooker in the stomach with a pair of scissors) to get revenge on the new campers populating the camp. Armed with a pair of hedge clippers he doesn&apos;t hesitate to hack into a dozen or so foul-mouthed, oversexed teens, setting aside special interest in counselor Todd (Brian Matthews), who was one of the kids responsible for his burning. Even though it&apos;s saddled with a tired, predictable plot, this is still one of the best of the Friday the 13th rip-offs, and that has a a lot to do with Tom Savini&apos;s gory special effects. The music score is also excellent and there are fun appearances by Jason Alexander, Holly Hunter, the guy who played Ratner in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and some other recognizable faces before they were famous. The original VHS of this film was heavily trimmed to remove the gore, but that footage has since been restored. I saw the uncut version on Showtime actually.",

It&apos;s a world of drugs, prostitution, petty crimes, and outright violence. Greg (Sean Astin), Little J (Balthazar Getty), crippled Manny (Will Smith), Crasher, and Brenda (Ricki Lake) are some of his street friends. Brenda brings along new girl Heather (Lara Flynn Boyle). King is out of county looking for his girlfriend Devon who has gone missing. Ted (Kyle MacLachlan) is Greg&apos;s drug dealer.\n\nThere are a lot of big names from the 90&apos;s and beyond. There is also Alyssa Milano, David Arquette, Christian Slater among others. I&apos;m surprised that I&apos;ve never heard of this movie but these old indies can slip by. It&apos;s hard to be ultra-realism when there are so many named actors but this has the simple grim reality. It&apos;s not too flashy. The plot is a bit scattered with a lot of different characters. I would like a story with a more distinct direction and more agency. I would make Tommy Ray a more concentration of King&apos;s attention and he could be the central target of the plot. Overall, it&apos;s interesting to see some of these actors pop up in this indie.",

On the contrary, they&apos;re fun because they&apos;re painfully realistic. This is a bitter humor Italian classic, so please don&apos;t expect the script to be &quot;british&quot;. Also, part of the epicness lies in the fake old Italian language used through the movie, and some scenes are gonna look plain if just subbed.

Working at a movie theater I get to see the reactions of our patrons after seeing each film we show; Cars is a must see this summer. There are very few genuine family movies released now a days, this is a clean movie that families can come together and enjoy without worrying about having to screen the film before bringing the kids.

This film is made with the same artistry, the same dark humor and specially with the same approach to criminal life.\n\nGreat character development, accomplished cinematography and a clear understanding of the Cali underworld are some of the qualities this movie brings to the viewer.\n\nThis movie is for Cali what &quot;Snatch&quot; was for London and it works so well.\n\nOf course there are some flaws, but this movie is such and acomplishment that you can let them go.\n\nA breath of fresh air for Colombian Cinema and the &quot;Dago-Formula&quot; that comes every year.\n\nMy deepest congratulations to the crew of &quot;PCP&quot;, you&apos;ve made a mark in Colombian Cinema History.",

What could go wrong?\n\nDo I really need to answer this question? I have even seen the full uncut version but Lance was only for a few minutes in it, and just to state a few sentences. On part of the 3D I guess I must have missed something because I have only seen 1 second of 3D. And why this rather boring flick was promoted by Fangoria is still up to this moment a question only to be answered. Some say it had a Gothic feeling, it&apos;s not because it takes place in a monastery that it is Gothic! Some say it&apos;s a return to the old slashers. I don&apos;t think this is a slasher at all. Slashers contain POV shots, nudity and the female hero. Well, maybe the last part did fit in but overall I found Sin Reaper a total waste of time and there were a lot of moments that I thought, would it be a sin to turn this turkey off?\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",

In this picture director Gordon Chan drops his successful foray into the &apos;Cop and Martial Arts Genres&apos;, and tackles a theme steeped in woozy metaphysics and SciFi which was very popular in Hollywood in the late 90&apos;s. However, exceptionally cheesy CGI and a brain- dead story line make this a pretty weak effort, but it&apos;s not without a few pluses. Anthony Wong and Andy Lau are Asian Superstars, and they have the best roles in this film, and several of the actors that were in BEAST COPS show up in this film. Gordon Chan is trying to show Hollywood that diverse and varied films from Hong Kong can hold there own in the worldwide market place. Too bad that Armageddon was not more of a successful venture."

If anything, it added to the nightmarish quality. Strange place, scared sh*tless, etc.\n\nVery creepy, lots of tension, great location. I agree with earlier posts, it was reminiscent of The Shining (evil location induces madness and murder).\n\nIt won&apos;t appeal to everyone (as we all have different tastes) but I find this type of thoughtful horror far more terrifying and disturbing than the usual &apos;obvious&apos; Hollywood horror - mainly because it invites you to use your imagination (a scary unlimited place!) instead of spelling it all out and tying up the loose ends.",

The idea of making it into more of a comedy didn&apos;t help at all. Characters looked stupid and storyline was ridiculous and boring. After about 30 minutes I kept looking at my watch, but I kept going because I wanted to see the ending. What a disappointment! I&apos;m really mad with the final result. Let&apos;s hope the 4th installment won&apos;t be so crappy. \n\nI did enjoy the acting, though, because Daniel Martin (the actor playing Koldo) is one of my favorites from Spain, and the woman playing the lead role did a good job too, but the characters were lacking so much insight that at the end, talent wasn&apos;t enough. \n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend this to anyone, unless you&apos;re a big fan of the first two and want to see everything related to it!",

      "reviewBody": "Exciting film set at the end of the 1970s , about four tourists threatened by hooligans locals , as there are hunters and prey . When they return to an ancestral village tensions build between them , a brewing conflict with locals becomes a threat to them . As two couples&apos;s holiday called Paul (Gary Oldman) , Lucy (Virginie Ledoyen) , Norman (Paddy Considine) , Isabel (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) in Spain are interrupted when they discover a girl imprisoned in a cabin . Ledoyen and Considine play a young married couple who are going through a difficult patch in their relationship and come to visit a friend Paul (Oldman) who now lives in the Basque region because he has married a woman from there (Aitiana Sánchez-Gijón) . It escalates quickly into a bloody battle between Brits and Spanish rednecks (Kandido Uranga , Patxi Bisquert , Lluis Homar) . Paul whose pacifism is put to supreme test attempts to protect a dim-witted little girl who they have found locked . They try to help her by taking her away from a dark house , but the local villagers, who have to protect the girl and seem determined to keep her in atrocious conditions, start a pursuit in the forest they know much better than the visitors . As the jealous as well as resentful locals and desirous of women assault their house , as they are viciously attacked . Their house is put under siege by the incensed villagers , but they defend the mansion with ferocity . Later on , they flee seeking security , but their attempts to help the little girl are hampered by the denseness of the forest and a relentless pursuit by the nasty rednecks .\n\nViolent film contains thrills , chills , suspense , twists , and results to be quite entertaining . A controversial violence-themed picture ; dealing with a known plot , as a group of British people go to a rural little village and face increasingly vicious local harassment . As their tranquil summer turns to horror when they discover a girl with horribly mutilated hands in the forest . We are facing a tense film , hard , tough , brilliant in many moments, with some aspect of western , with a grand and impressive ending . The picture packs intrigue , action , intense drama and lots of violence . The story takes parts , here and there , from famous films such as ¨Deliverance&quot;, ¨Wild bunch¨ , ¨Next of kin¨ and especially &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; . The main cast is frankly excellent with players of several nationalities as the British Gary Oldman and Paddy Considine ; French Virginie Ledoyen and Spanish Aitiana Sanchez Gijon . Support cast is mostly Spaniard such as Jon Ariño , Lluís Homar who excels in his acting , Kandido Uranga and special appearance of Álex Angulo , ¨Dia De La Bestia¨&apos;s starring . Gary Oldman, Paddy Considine and Virginie Ledoyen were dubbed for the Spanish version of the film. The scenes where the characters had whole scenes with English dialog were all dubbed ; only when the characters spoke in English with the Spanish characters, the dubbing actors said their lines in English ; &apos;Aitana Sánchez-Gijon&apos; dubbed herself . \n\nUnax Mendia cinematography is excellent creating a rainy and cold atmosphere , he&apos;s expert on sombre photography , being stunningly shot on location in Navarra woods . Thrilling and moving musical score by Fernando Velazquez who subsequently would make a notorious career with successful films as ¨Orphanage¨ , ¨Devil¨ , ¨Mama¨ and ¨The impossible¨ . The flick was finely produced by the chairman of Filmax Productions , Julio Fernandez along with his brother Carlos Fernandez as executive producer , they&apos;re two successful producers and experts on terror genre , producing a lot of hits , such as ¨The machinist¨, ¨Rec ¨1¨, 2¨ and ¨3¨ , ¨Fragiles¨, ¨Darkness¨, ¨El perfume¨ , ¨The nun¨ , ¨Transsiberian¨ and many others . The flick was professionally directed by Koldo Serra in his only film and obtained moderated success . Serra uses many long shots, showing a leisurely narrative pace . Definitely a big &quot;debut&quot; of director Koldo Serra who promises to be a great filmmaker .",

Minor spoiler but this movie really reminded me of a British movie from last year called Unwelcome. The premise is really similar except that this one place in the snow during Christmas time.\n\nWe have an American family that moves to Norway and has to deal with some sort of fish-out-of-the-water situation because they have cultural differences from the locals and while the parents are trying to fit in, the moody daughter just wants to go back and her little brother finds something mysterious in the barn.\n\nBasically we have a pretty stereotypical family situation and some also stereotypical side character&apos;s, especially the towns Sheriff who was the main comedic relief which sometimes worked and sometimes not so much.\n\nThis is a lighthearted comedy with some horror aspects and some gnarly kills and I overall enjoyed the watching experience. This might not be some Christmas classic like Gremlins but it could still be an annual watch for me during the Christmas time. [5,9/10]",

When his partner reincarnates, the rookie policeman Fung (Stephen Fung) applies for the position; but Paper Chan explains Chiu that the team is to be formed by a man and a spirit, and Chiu has a death star on his hand that dooms his friends to die. Meanwhile, Chiu falls in love for Nurse Danielle (Danielle Graham), but he avoids her to protect her life against the fate of the death star. When the fiend Water Ghost (Alex Fong) possesses Fung seeking revenge against Chiu, he has to battle against the evil spirit trying to protect also his friend.\n\nThe melodramatic &quot;2002&quot; blends action, sci-fi, fantasy, fight scenes, drama, romance, comedy, free merchandise of a bank and an ice-cream brand and cheap philosophy; the result is an enjoyable, but very confused movie, with weird rules and no explanation for the ghosts and fiends in Hong Kong. The special effects work very well and in the end this film is a good entertainment. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;2002  Exterminadores do Além&quot; (&quot;2002  Terminators from Beyond&quot;)",

I love the friendship between Victoria and Toddy because it feels so genuine and it&apos;s rare to see a friendship (particularly between men and women) portrayed so well in movies. I love the romance between Victoria and King, because they&apos;re well-matched, but at the same time the problems in their relationship are so realistic. Fundamental inability to compromise?

The plot is as old as the hills as pals Mitchum and Lemmon fall out over Hayworth, the woman they are transporting &apos;from nowhere to nowhere&apos;. The film generates a little excitement, (though not much), when Lemmon gets trapped in a ship that is about to blow up. The terrible dialogue is courtesy of Irwin Shaw from a book by Max Catto and director Robert Parrish was hardly the man to turn a pig&apos;s ear into a silk purse.",

      "reviewBody": "GODZILLA AND MOTHRA: THE BATTLE FOR EARTH is a follow-up to GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH and a remake of sorts of the &apos;60s kaiju GODZILLA VS MOTHRA. This is hugely entertaining kid&apos;s movie, filled to the brim with colourful special effects, spectacular scenes of destruction, and an engaging human storyline to boot.\n\nThe film&apos;s influences are many and varied, as you&apos;ll soon guess with the opening sequence featuring an Indiana Jones-style character raiding the ancient ruins at Angkor Wat. Before long we&apos;re knee-deep in a storyline involving a crashed meteorite, a reawakened Godzilla, the eruption of Mount Fuji, the emergence of a world-destroying creature called Battra, and of course Mothra himself.\n\nSpecial emphasis is given to the character of Mothra, who is as hilarious as ever. As much as I love the giant furry moth, there&apos;s something undeniably hilarious about the creature in caterpillar form too, especially when hanging on to Godzilla&apos;s tail. I like the way the writers hark back to the &apos;60s movies with the presence of the tiny twins and Infant Island; all good stuff. Plus, there&apos;s more giant monster action here than in the last film, although there&apos;s still time for plenty of human characters to get involved in a wider-reaching plot than usual. The message here is of the usual &quot;save the environment&quot; variety but it doesn&apos;t get in the way of what is a hugely enjoyable piece of entertainment.",

True respect for the dedication, hard work and absolute presence of mind to clear away all the minutiae that many of us get caught up in to focus on the details that are so very important. \n\nI have actually seen action films with more lulls and uninteresting parts then what I watched in this film.

      "reviewBody": "Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid effectively inhabit their roles in &quot;Far From Heaven,&quot; an engrossing flashback to an affluent northeastern suburb, Hartford CT in 1957-8.  Quaid is Frank Whitaker, top sales exec in a company meeting the voracious needs of American consumers for the latest in gadgets and appliances.  His wife, Cathy, is so much the high profile model for the typical stay-at-home, support your hubby, take care of the kids mom that she is shadowed by the local gossip reporter and her photographer.  She thinks she has the perfect marriage and two terrific if not invariably best behaved kids.  Both, however, are too interesting to be mistaken as a large screen resurrection of a 50s sitcom couple.\n\nCathy can&apos;t catch the clue when she bails Frank out of the police station and he mutters angrily about the arresting officers mistaking him for a &quot;loiterer.&quot;  A loiterer in a neat business suit with a topcoat in Hartford? Only one kind of well-dressed character like that attracted police attention in those days.\n\nDispensing good cheer everywhere, Cathy decides to bring dinner to her hardworking-at-night husband (no spoiler here, every media review has this part). And what should she find?  Frank is in the arms of a man, kissing him actually, clothing in disarray.\n\nToday, a presumably straight spouse or lover being gay, secretly, isn&apos;t a taboo subject. It was in Cathy and Frank&apos;s time and, in fact, no movie from that period would have touched this subject with a ten-foot boom mike. &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; was risque enough.\n\nCathy insists Frank get help and James Rebhorn in a brief role as psychiatrist Dr. Bowman explains the most modern therapeutic approaches to &quot;converting&quot; Frank to exclusive heterosexuality.  This was in the days when homosexuality was an official diagnosed mental illness.\n\nIn what could have been a familiar variation of the white/black awkward beginnings of friendship seen in Sidney Poitier movies but which in this instance has a refreshing originality, Cathy befriends gardener Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert).  An attractive and prominent white woman being seen in public with a black man in the South at this time would have led to probably horrific repercussions.  Here we get to see 1950s racist northern suburbia, people who decry Arkansas obduracy (there&apos;s a brief shot of President Eisenhower on TV announcing the despatch of the 101st Airborne Division to confront the state&apos;s mad governor at Little Rock High School) while dispensing their own venom. No guns, no lynchings, no white sheets - just an insidious degradation of blacks, reducing them to actual invisibility when convenient.\n\nThe friendship between Cathy and Raymond is at first tentative and it grows with affecting tenderness.  So does the shocked anger of the wealthy gaggle in Frank and Cathy&apos;s social circle.\n\nIs Frank cured of his &quot;illness?&quot;  Does racial tolerance and respect for diversity seep into Hartford&apos;s tony neighborhood?  Does everyone live happily ever after?  Go see the film.  The mid-afternoon packed audience in Manhattan&apos;s Lincoln Plaza Cinema broke into applause at the end.\n\nViola Davies turns in a small but critically important role as the Whitaker&apos;s maid, Sybil.  Fine acting.\n\nDirector Todd Haynes allowed Moore and Quaid to make their roles real, involving, and anguished and funny in turn. Both stars deserve Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.\n\nRooted in the 50s in many ways, composer Elmer Bernstein turned out a good score, original rather than depending on recognizable tunes from the time. But as is so often the case, at points the score is unduly intrusive where the actors&apos; words and expressions convey all that is necessary, music being an annoyance.\n\n8/10."

The film is about women that may have no other choice but to sell their bodies, about freaks that buy their bodies, about these women&apos;s inability to pay off their so called &quot;debt&quot;, about cruelty, about general stigma that surrounds these women. All of the women in the story&apos;s brothel are regular girls that have no one to turn to for help, but possibly each other. The reference to the pseudo &quot;study&quot; that one idiot sites in the film, the choice of music, the way the film ends - all help to make the audience think about the film and its story not as something from the past, but as issues that continue on and the reasons (society maybe) behind these issues.",

The local ski-teatchers agree to organise a &quot;fox-hunt&quot; for her. Leni and Hannes are &quot;the foxes&quot;, and about 40 other skiers will have to catch them, starting with a 15 minutes delay. It&apos;s not the story that makes this film, but the extremely spectacular, thrilling shots about ski. How many crew members and figurants broke their bones in making this picture ? is a question every specator will ask himself ! On the other hand, the film also reveals us the beauty and the delight of ski, like only a genuine black&amp;white picture could do! If you have the chance to see this picture, don&apos;t miss it: you won&apos;t regret, even if you are not in the least interested in ski or sports.",

      "reviewBody": "If you think about the French Invasions of the 19th Century, you think about a time of war, tragedy, heroism, violence and excesses. It is the perfect plot for an epic movie. Unfortunately, in the case of &quot;Linhas de Wellington&quot;, the movie is Portuguese. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I am Portuguese too. What I mean is that we, as a nation, have a very hard time dealing with our own heritage and heroes. I don&apos;t know, perhaps deep inside each of us knows how short we fell of living up to our forefathers extraordinary legacy. Anyway, regardless of the reason why, the fact is that we do not give enough praise to the best among us, and that reflects on our modern art in general and in this movie in particular. That being said, instead of all the drama, heroism and war, this movie shows the story of simple people, ordinary anonymous folks, leaving their land as the French Army advances. Unfortunately, there are too many characters, not shown long enough for the viewer too actually identify himself with any of them. That turns the movie into a tale about people you don&apos;t really care for. As for the Duque of Wellington, the way he is portrayed is nothing short of revolting... As you would expect from a Portuguese movie because of all I said above. As a conclusion, &quot;Linhas de Wellington&quot; is a big disappointment. It is watchable, but nothing more than that.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Total Eclipses&quot; narrates the romance that is born among the poets Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis, in a courageous and excellent performance, Thewlis plays strong scenes with experience and professionalism) and Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo Di Caprio, before being thrown to the Hollywood&apos;s stardom in &quot;Titanic&quot;). The film documents, without make-ups,Paul Verlaine&apos;s slow destruction,a man who is consumed by the love and hate that he fells for Rimbauld.Director Agniezka Holland accomplished a touching and beautiful work,counting with a perfect plasticity that reconstitutes the time and the romance among the two men in a detailed way and without shame, what can,in fact,shock Di Caprio&apos;s fans in some delicate moments.Even being a little slow in a lot of parts of the story, &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; is efficient when its seen as a drama that lectures about the difficulty of being homosexual, but besides this topic, it analyzes what happens when people abdicate of their happiness and  suffer due to social conventions, and finally it ends up in a intelligent conclusion:that only through the courage and through the love it&apos;s possible not only to break such barriers but also to achieve redemption.Director Agnieszka Holland conducts with experience a story that, in the hands of another director, could be reduced into a common and not very innovative denominator, and the lenses of her camera shows, without make-ups and courts to alleviate the impact of the scenes, the whole suffering, the prejudice and the pain that marks the relationship between Rimbaud and Verlaine. The two poets&apos; love is realistically developed by Holland, starting by the friendship, in which the two writers begin to know important things about theirselves and discover that they have a lot in common, in terms that both are unhappy with the path their lives acquired, the doubts, the fears and the frustrations,till the beginning of the romance. The scene in which the first kiss happens, when Rimbauld seduces Verlaine and tries to get closer to him and ease his nervousness,is strong,touching and beautiful,this  decisive and provocative part is filmed and written in a sweet and human way. The focus that the production gives to the story, therefore,is natural and realistic, what can scare many people away of the box- offices for the context declaredly homosexual of the story.&quot;Total Eclipse&quot; explores and studies the relationship without making concessions and without allowing any demagogy or fear. There are rough scenes such as the one in which Thewlis is tirelessly sodomized by Di Caprio, there are moments of fondness when the two kiss each other,but in the same way the sick and morbid aspect of the relationship is expressed, when, for example, Rimbauld stabs Rimbaud&apos;s hand to prove his love.Being a heterosexual, i concluded that, instead of adopting a dogmatic and racist posture, it would be better if i  could appreciate the film not as just another plot about two gay guys who are in love but I tried to enlarge my point of view, understanding that the film was, actually, a simple feeble love history marked by the suffering and resignation. Thus, I recommend &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; as an intelligent and efficient drama, a work that deserves to be applauded by its initiative and courage, for the excellent performances and for the safe and kind work by Agnieszka Holland, who tells a love story in a distressing and realist form. &quot;Total Eclipses&quot; i rated for strong sexuality and nudity, language, and some startling violence and it runs 111 minutes.The Cast: David Thewlis, Romane Bohringer and Leonardo Di Caprio."

The plot is fairly well contrived, with a delightful twist at the end that I was not expecting. The actors do a fair job, not worthy of an Oscar, but tolerable. The suspense is believable, I in fact found myself yelling at Bruce to run. It can suck you in if you go into it, not expecting to see the greatest thriller of all times, but simply...well I guess the best way to describe it is Hallmark Hall of Fame quality, only its a thriller, not a drama, and there is no cheesy love lesson at the end.",

      "reviewBody": "The cliché of the Italian bachelor living at home with a doting mother who waits on him and prepares his favorite meals is turned on it&apos;s head in the delicious Italian treat, &quot;Mid-August Lunch.&quot; In this film, unemployed fifty-ish bachelor Gianni (Gianni Di Gregorio) shows respect for his ninety-something mother by taking good care of her and lovingly preparing their meals.\n\nThe small family has been living off of credit for some time and is months behind on their maintenance and electric bills for their ancient apartment. The landlord is willing to forgive the dept if they take in his mother so he can get away for the Mid-August holiday. The landlord drops off his mother AND his aunt. And soon the doctor&apos;s mother joins the mix. So Gianni must survive the weekend playing good host to four strong-willed shut-ins. What impressed me most was how he never loses his manners but treats these woman with the respect earned by those who have reached a certain age. \n\nThis is a film about the joys of entertaining. It illustrates the isolation that comes with aging and our continued need to socialize. There is an Italian saying, &quot;A tavola no s&apos;invecchia,&quot; that articulates the theme perfectly, &quot;The passage of time is suspended with experiencing the pleasure of good food, good wine and company.&quot; \n\n&quot;Mid-August Lunch&quot; dishes up &quot;slice of life&quot; humor with simple, authentic Italian flavors like those in the perch with potatoes, oregano and rosemary lovingly served at the holiday feast. \n\nMovie Blessings!

      "name": "This is Korean cinema at its very best, an edge-of-your-seat thriller that brings you into the demented psychologies of seemingly ordinary individuals in everyday life",
      "reviewBody": "The latest Korean action-thriller to hit theatres in Singapore, &apos;Confession of Murder&apos; is a gem of a film that can be compared to the likes of &apos;Old Boy&apos; and &apos;Memories of Murder&apos;.\n\nAt the heart of this movie is the tale of Detective Choi, whose quest is to capture the one thing that evades him. It&apos;s a very human resolve and one that is particularly relatable to the people of our time. We&apos;re not all cops searching for a suspect, but very much like Detective Choi, we have that one answer that we seek our entire lives and work hard to find out. The prevalence and influence of the media, plastic surgery, as well as blind devotion to a public figure have all been gracefully written into the script, and so surrounding that story is a context so rooted in reality that it could very well be our own daily lives.\n\nThe performances in this film are truly commendable, particularly those of the stuntmen for the deadly accurate execution of the stunts. In particular, the main actors brilliantly brought in the subtle aspects of their characters, in order to bring humanity to a larger-than life drama, effectively giving a hook for the audience to relate to the movie on a deeper level.\n\nThere is also dark humor in the movie, which brings some levity into an otherwise dark world that the audience becomes immersed in. One almost feels guilty for laughing, which is a testament to the irony of the humor. What makes the situation on screen so humorous is how exceedingly close it is to what would happen if such a thing were to take place in real-life. Such a thing is almost never portrayed in films for the sake of cinematic impact- but by doing the opposite, &apos;Confession of Murder&apos; turns itself into almost a satire and criticism of popular culture.\n\nThis is one film that defines &apos;order in chaos&apos; and does so with a great deal of style. The makers of it have taken a complex plot and planned it out with such precision that even to the non-Korean speaking viewer, the story being told is clear and concise. There is no beating around the bush with this film. The pacing is just right such that Confession of Murder never loses the audience&apos;s attention, and even at the most tumultuous times of this film (such as one of the many fast-paced dialogue exchanges), details are never lost. Even the action sequences have been tightly-choreographed in order to mould into the complex camera-work and it shows on screen as a beautiful and graceful wedding of skills from both cast and crew. \n\nThe twist at the end is also a reminder of what great cinema is and is capable of doing, i.e. shocking the audience by leaving out one aspect of the story and then revealing it at the end only to change the audience&apos;s entire perspective of what has happened all along. It is making the audience feel like they should have known better. It also proves the uncomfortable truth that we are capable of being fooled, and that reality as we perceive it is often imperfect.\n\nIn this film, the peripeteia then leads to a startling climax which fulfils the purpose of every character in this film before moving down into a resolution which leaves no loose ends untied. Indeed, &apos;Confession of Murder&apos; is a film indeed worth watching and a tale highly relevant to our celebrity-obsessed times.",

      "reviewBody": "Steven Soderbergh&apos;s much-maligned digital satire of Hollywood took an unfair savaging at the hands of American critics, who seem to resent the fact that the man has become the single most interesting and consistently exciting film director currently working in America. Designed as a deliberately low-budget, quasi-improvised indie production to counter-balance the big studio production of &quot;Ocean&apos;s Eleven&quot;, &quot;Full Frontal&quot; was shot according to a Dogme 95-like manifesto (the actors had to drive themselves to work and do their own wardrobe and make-up, all the locations are pre-existing), and is a cross between the confessional nature of &quot;Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape&quot;, the multi-story structure of &quot;Magnolia&quot; and the film-within-a-film framework of François Truffaut&apos;s &quot;Day for Night&quot;. It&apos;s the tale of a day in the life of six Los Angelenos connected in some way to the film industry: budding screenwriters Enrico Colantoni and David Hyde Pierce; Pierce&apos;s sister-in-law Mary McCormack, a struggling masseuse, and wife Catherine Keener, a human resources VP on the verge of a nervous breakdown; black actor Blair Underwood and film star Julia Roberts. Soderbergh follows the day&apos;s events as if he were shooting a documentary, in grainy (post-produced) DV, intercutting it with 35mm photography of a film in production starring Underwood and Roberts, whose plot is supposed to echo the main characters&apos; situations. The Chinese-box structure only really becomes comprehensible about a third of the way in, and what looks at first like a self-indulgent exercise in the mechanics of low-budget filmmaking quickly becomes a cinema masterclass as Soderbergh effortlessly navigates the veritable maze of referential layers between film and life to the point you can no longer distinguish where film ends and reality begins, throwing in a number of celebrity cameos (Brad Pitt, Miramax&apos;s Harvey Weinstein, Terence Stamp reprising a scene from &quot;The Limey&quot;) that blur the borders even further. You have to be open for it, but if you are you&apos;ll be richly rewarded."

In this movie, she&apos;s a perky go-getter who&apos;s aghast when she finds out that the world will not necessarily adapt itself to her designs and whims, until...guess what....it does and she gets everything she wanted anyway.\n\nThis movie is harmless enough, but the only thing that makes it more worth your time than something from the straight-to-DVD bargain bin in the supermarket (or maybe this WAS one of those films) is a crazy and admittedly pretty funny performance from Michael Keaton as Bledel&apos;s doofus father.\n\nGrade: B-",

      "reviewBody": "If you had to pick a typical Mary Pickford film to understand her appeal in silent movies you should look no further than The Poor Little Rich Girl. In this the 24 Mary with the curls that audiences the world over loved, plays an 11-12 year old girl, neglected by her status conscious parents.\n\nNot that the idea was anything new, but Mary does put it over quite well. Her parents Madlaine Traverse are caught up in their busy societal world and pretty much ignore their child. But when she accidentally overdoses on some medicine and hovers between life and death her parents wake up and smell the coffee.\n\nOne thing I found absolutely fascinating was that apparently as a punishment for misbehavior one was forced to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. That certainly raises some interesting questions about gender identity in American society in 1917. Mary is forced to wear boys clothes and when she goes out and meets a gang of street kids, she&apos;s questioned about her masculinity and really lashes out at her tormentors.\n\nWhat makes the film really standout though for me is the fantasy world that director Maurice Tourneur created as Mary is in a coma fighting for her life. Given the times the special effects cinematography was wonderful for its time. Cecil B. DeMille couldn&apos;t have done better creating a view of how a child saw the world around her and the possible paradise she could have if she quit fighting for her own life.\n\nGreat special effects and a standout performance by Mary Pickford make The Poor Little Rich Girl a classic from the days when movies had no voice.",

When the film first came out, it rocketed to number 1 on the bottom 100 list. That ranking was undeserved, as the movie does have decent technical aspects (editing, sound) relative to Manos and Future War. Its good to see Gigli settling a little further down the list. From the outset, I could tell the dialog was just horrible. It was unfunny 90% of the time, and contained useless overlong scenes. One example was the whole &apos;pleasing a woman&apos; sequence where Lopez was doing Yoga on a mat while talking with Affleck. Just horrible. Jennifer Lopez has to win the award for most painfully miscast actress. She is totally unbelievable as a Lesbian girl gangster. She failed to convince me that she had ever broken the law in the past. &apos;I did some really bad things&apos; -- yeah right. I would avoid this like the plague. 1/10",

You are either gonna expect one or two things from this.  1.)A solid action movie about an American fighting ninjas or 2.)You&apos;re gonna laugh till you hurt.  Well this movie definitely falls into #2.  You see its quite ridiculous.  Ninjas with bones made of metal and feel no pain?  Yet, when they&apos;re attacked you hear bones crack and them yell out in pain?  Or the fact that these superninja&apos;s are taken down by a Vanilla Ice/Guile look alike who needs a serious fashion update.  Its comedic relief for all!  Or the fact that this bad to the bone lazy eyed Asian man pulls out a shotgun from out of nowhere.  Or the black man, named Jackson, pulls out knifes from no where.  I think to really sum up this movie its one of those things that&apos;ll either end up on Mystery Science 3000 or be in the $3 bin at Wal-mart to buy.  Which is how i got my copy!  Regardless this is more of a cartoon than a action movie.....sad.  It is funny to watch ninjas get shot down by Marines in hawaiian shirts!  Oh the fun!"

      "reviewBody": "In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called &quot;Jumanji&quot; that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan&apos;s father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. \n\nIn the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \n\n&quot;Jumanji&quot; is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90&apos;s. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Jumanji&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "A good thriller in the old-style classic sense, beautifully filmed in color by England&apos;s Hammer company. &quot;The Man Who Could Cheat Death&quot; is somewhat static near the beginning and almost stage play in its construction, but that is OK as it is well acted by a fine ensemble cast.\n\nAnton Diffring offers a nervous-energy-driven, neurotically sinister presence from the very beginning of the film. He provides the requisite menace that is essential to his role. Beautiful Hazel Court, Diffring, Christopher Lee and others contribute elegant, psychologically interesting characterizations that are rendered within an uncluttered thriller format.\n\nI can&apos;t emphasize enough how thoroughly this film epitomizes the unique Hammer production values, decor, color scheme and general style, while also effectively evoking foggy turn-of-the-century nighttime Paris streets. Despite the Paris locale, it is distinctively Hammer. Laboratories, scalpels, weird medicines, fog, and all the classic elements are here. Fans of the genre and of the era in thriller filmmaking should not miss it.",

Here, she continues to be so awesome but this movie, sorry to say this, bored me to the death. Maybe because of the story itself, not because of her. I waited for the end, and almost pushed the fast forward button. A real deception, but that&apos;s my own opinion. Maybe other folks could find it better than I did. \n\nThe script is the only responsible of this failure, not the acting because, I repeat, Yolande Moreau is here as good as usual. It could have been a good film about guilt, but I did not feel it that way. That&apos;s not the first time Martin Provost and Yolande Moreau worked together."

I did find this movie to be enjoyable mainly for the action. As a movie, it has many flaws. I appreciate that this installment goes back to the dark tone of the first film. However, story wise and acting wise, it pretty weak in comparison. Sharla Cheung is gorgeous, but plays a very unlikable character. The male lead is a guy who I have never seen before and lacks the charisma and screen presence to knock this out of the park. The guy has some great fighting skills (or is made to look like a master by Yuen Woo Ping), but is not worth mentioning if you compare him to Donnie Yen. The film is mostly a humorless affair and Michael Wong does little with his clumsy acting and unlikable character to make audiences sympathetic. Even with a weak story and unlikable characters the movie moves along quickly with some absolutely outstanding fights scenes and shootouts that are very bloody and unrelenting. So if you are a action fan, the series is definitely worth a look. But as a movie, only the first one is outstanding and really well done in my opinion.",

He pushed the boundaries deliberately and put down decades worth of material onto just two discs. He is missed and this documentary is just another proof of his much missed presence. This documentary has been created on the basis of his short lived carrier - with results pretty much arguable. Unfortunately the way one remaining relative handles the legacy of Jeff&apos;s music is pretty much unloyal. A shame that hundreds of hours of live material is resting in the lap of his mother who only wants to preserve his son&apos;s legacy by not releasing a thing from Jeff&apos;s vaults but creating false myths and productions based on doubtful theories (just like this release.) Numerous FM recordings are laying ahead without the slightest chance of getting released in their finest, pristine quality because of other &quot;would-be&quot; business things apart from Columbia. Unfortunately not one box set has emerged glorifying Jeff&apos;s spectacular live performances since his tragic quit in 1997.\n\nWhile we have real documentaries and footages of him performing we could make more out of his magnificent art.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. It&apos;s given us the lines &quot;Show me the money&quot;, &quot;Help me, Help you&quot;, &quot;You had me at hello&quot; and &quot;You complete me&quot;. And it&apos;s that last line, that really describe this movie. It&apos;s really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, it&apos;s not an easy trip but for the most part it&apos;s an entertaining one. \n\nJerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and he&apos;s engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital, the client&apos;s young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a &quot;mission statement&quot; for the company. The &quot;mission statement&quot; basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesn&apos;t like it. \n\nThe movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athlete&apos;s earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning they&apos;re just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end, Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients they&apos;re more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.\n\nJerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise, and he gives one of his best performance. I think it&apos;s every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jr&apos;s. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. It&apos;s sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger, who plays an office worker in Tom Cruise&apos;s office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his &quot;mission statement&quot; into practice. \n\nAll in all, I think it&apos;s a good movie with a very observant script, complimented by great acting.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d been meaning to watch Midnight in Paris for ages but, I have to confess, I was put off by the presence of Owen Wilson, who I could not really envisage as the lead in a Woody Allen film. He was actually surprisingly good though and did a decent job as the vessel from which Allen&apos;s brilliant dialogue could be heard. However, this is not an actor-driven film or even a story-driven film; its beauty lies in the simple but clever script and the easy-going laid-back style that you&apos;d expect from a Woody Allen film all about nostalgia. \n\nTo be fair, I can completely understand why there have been so many negative reviews of Midnight in Paris. There isn&apos;t a great deal going on superficially and the characters are all gloriously stereotypical. This doesn&apos;t matter though because, although the film is quite simple, it is at the same time wonderfully clever and thought-provoking. However, you do probably have to be in the right mood to watch it. I saw this film on a lazy Saturday afternoon and wasn&apos;t expecting too much, so when I was left both entertained and thinking about the past, the present and the future, it was a pleasant surprise. There are few films these days that still have you thinking about them several days later – this is definitely one of them. What do you want from life, with whom do you want to experience it, and why are we always so dissatisfied with where we are and what we&apos;ve got? Like I say, quite thought-provoking!\n\nIt&apos;s incredibly ironic that some critics go on about how Woody Allen films aren&apos;t anywhere near as good as they were back in the seventies and that he&apos;s a has-been pseudo-intellectual, when here he is making a film about nostalgia and poking fun at pseudo-intellectuals in both an obvious and also a more subtle manner. Midnight in Paris is full of self-parody and interesting contradictions, but not everything is immediately apparent and I believe that some viewers of the film may have simply taken it at face value and consequently been left thinking &quot;is that it then?&quot;. \n\nOn a slightly more negative side, I am perplexed that some people have praised the cinematography and the wonderful images of Paris in the light, in the dark and in the rain. To me, the use of colour and imagery are not too impressive and I would argue that Paris has looked far better in plenty of other films. The music can be a little annoying too – especially in the opening sequence, which seems to go on for ever! \n\nAs I said before though, Midnight in Paris is primarily about the dialogue and the interesting ideas that it throws out to the audience. Catch them if you like, and run with them. It&apos;s a great easy-going relaxing film that&apos;ll hopefully leave you both entertained and thought- provoked. \n\n8/10",

Brazil shows us a hilarious exaggeration of the monotony of machine like run bureaucracy, and man&apos;s constant voyage to avoid responsibility. &quot;That&apos;s not my department.&quot; Everyone seems to say. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a low ranking government employee. When an error leads to the execution of engineer Archibald Buttle (Brian Miller) instead of terrorist Archibald Tuttle (Robert De Niro), Sam attempts to fix this, and inadvertently becomes an enemy of the state. Read that scenario again. This is a funny movie. It&apos;s a dark comedy/political satire, and almost every joke works. The nonchalant attitude of the government depicted in the film is where a big chunk of the humor comes from. It&apos;s a very smart comedy. Honestly if you like political satire, then Brazil is one we can all enjoy together.",

The 1968 original appears on TVs scattered across the movie reminding you how superior it is to Broadstreet&apos;s offering. The opening is quite interesting following to the tropes of the original (the &quot;Coming to get you, Barbara&quot; line absurdly phoned in via text message). It has a bit of atmosphere but over all its all tongue and cheek stuff, suffering from a TV feel and low budget production values. It&apos;s on par with its 2012 follow up Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation but not a touch on Tom Savini&apos;s superb Night of the Living Dead (1990).\n\nHorror character actor Sid Haig appears but even with its short running time and Brianna Brown, Johanna Black and Cristin Michele it&apos;s still totally forgettable."

The movie establishes its purpose in the beginning and that&apos;s pretty much it...no twists, no new discoveries, no heart-warming scenes that&apos;s gonna make you care for anyone. The movie is wall to wall action and rarely stops. This is a straight up action film with a sci-fi setting. It&apos;s science fiction without the science..Demolition Man style with with martial arts thrown in. Jet Li plays both the good guy and the villain and his villain role steals the show until the final fight scene. The Jet vs. Jet fight scene is amazing and shows that Jet is the man when it comes to martial arts and what he does can&apos;t be imitated. &quot;good&quot; Jet&apos;s BaGua Zhang fist style is beautiful for lack of a better term. &quot;bad&quot; Jet&apos;s Xinyi style is very brutal so it&apos;s not really graceful, just straight forward attack. Honestly it made the Matrix fight scenes look silly by comparison.\n\nThe wife and multiverse cop characters could have been developed better but they served their purpose. The movie certainly could have been longer and the soundtrack works in some parts and not in others...too much alternative for my taste. Those are the only problems I have with The One. It leaves you wanting more. If it&apos;s a box office hit it definitely has room for a sequel. Overall I thought it was a good movie for eye candy and action/martial arts junkies.",

      "name": "As a stand alone vampire flick, it&apos;s worth seeing.",
      "reviewBody": "Combining The Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned novels into one screenplay was, ahem, damned to suffer massive story cuts because of the intricate and detailed background of a dozen or so characters involved. The amount of detail always was the strength of the Vampire Chronicles, in my opinion, and they were certainly worth the read.\n\nThat said, the question remains, without the detail and extra characters, can the basic story of Lestat&apos;s re-awakening of the Queen of all vampires be entertaining and sufficient enough to sustain itself?  While I can not answer the question with a glowing appraisal, I will certainly admit that it did a decent job of combining all of the basic elements into a stand alone movie.  The fact that this movie can stand on it&apos;s own without any ties to the prequel, Interview with the Vampire, is one of it&apos;s assets.  You do not need any fore-knowledge of the characters, books, or prequel movie in order to watch this.\n\nEven though it fits into it&apos;s own little package does not mean it was packed very well.  There were some plot holes, some of which could have been filled by simply restoring the &quot;Ancients&quot; scenes that were on the dvd.  I understand, as the dvd points out, that they were left out because it introduced another subplot and characters that would add unnecessary confusion.  While I agree with their reasoning, I do think they should have somehow salvaged the scene so that while the introductions of the ancients would have been left out, Maharet&apos;s few lines about Akasha&apos;s reign of destruction and the vampire&apos;s responsibility should have remained.  They would have added a needed sense of urgency and motivation that would have made the final confrontation with Akasha and the ancients a bit more reasonable and satisfying.\n\nThe character of Jessie is supposed to be the human link for the viewer to empathize through as they are taken into the world of vampires.  In some scenes, this works adequately, but on the whole, Jessie&apos;s motivations, while they are explained, seem kind of empty.  I am not sure if I can fault the actress or script, but when the movie was over, I still felt ambivalent about the character&apos;s experiences.\n\nThere were other elements that were not as fleshed out as they could be. The paranormal Talamasca needed a bit more background about their vampire tracking as did the character of Maharet and her family tree.  Like Jessie, they were given some explanation, but I think a couple more lines of dialogue would have helped.\n\nAs I mentioned, the movie did a decent job of the basic story, but massive changes were made from the source material.  Characters were dropped completely, or merged together, and huge sections of character history were removed.  Most notably, Lestat&apos;s history is extremely compacted and revised. Nonetheless, there are some things that remained that I thought were done pretty well.  The character of Lestat in this picture is rebellious and reckless which is more true to the character than he was portrayed in Interview.  Lestat&apos;s re-awakening and concert scenes were exactly like I had envisioned when I originally read the book.  The character of Akasha was also as I pictured and a very good casting choice.\n\nIf you are a fan of the books, and you need the twins, Gabriel, Magnus, and crew, you are going to have difficulty sitting through this.  If, on the other hand, you can set that aside and view this as a vampire movie of it&apos;s own, unrelated to the chronicles, you will probably enjoy this for the stand-alone vampire flick that it is.\n\nIn summary, worth the rental."

DEFA banned the film because of its content regarding uranium and the nuclear arms race. The film was made while this was a hot topic, but for international diplomacy reasons, the film was banned so as not to interfere with Warsaw negotiations. Taken as a 1958 film, and not a &apos;70s film, it becomes much better for comparison to other Konrad Wolf films and serves as a much better example of national film within the GDR at the time. As an earlier Wolf film, then, the presence of anti-fascist ideas and propaganda for the socialist state is quite present. This type of content dropped off in later Wolf films."

It&apos;s about a hapless man who suffers under a strange werewolf-curse which is related to an even stranger occult sect (led by Cameron Mitchell!). In a way it pays homage to the Spanish werewolf-flics starring Paul Naschy as Valdemar Daninsky. But the Naschy-films look like big budget epics compared to this mess, which is so bad that one has to see it to believe it. Director Andolfi not only plays the lead role (credited as Eddy Endolf) but also handles the special effects and many other things. Sometimes one might believe he was the only one behind the camera (maybe he was, who knows?).\n\nBesides the cursed man and the sect, the incoherent plot involves the least threatening mafia killers ever banned on celluloid; with such mobsters, &quot;The Godfather&quot; would have been the comedy of the 20th century. All the actors seem to be amateurs, probably good friends of director/everything Andolfi. The special effects (especially the werewolf-make-up and the old fashioned transformation sequences) are less convincing than most monster scenes from, shall we say, films by Ed Wood jr. All in all, this shoddy mess is unbelievably ridiculous.\n\nDespite the fact that the film is inept from every imaginable aspect, it is good fun and highly entertaining, at least for watching once - a party tape and a master example of a film that lacks any quality.

      "reviewBody": "Wit, insight, deft characterization, family misery, and social commentary all play a part in Holiday. The acting and script are superb -- all the characters are sympathetically drawn and interact in the foreground, while wealth and its &quot;privileges&quot; form the background.\n\nIs love a social obligation? Or does it spring from sheer affinity? Should the acquisition of wealth be the summum bonum of experience -- or happen accidently, as the result of hard and honest work? These are the questions that will tease you, as you enjoy the gleaming intelligence of Katherine Hepburn and the polished insouciance of Cary Grant. Both are in top form!!!\n\nWhat stands out in my recollection of this film is the theme of play. The stars are playful; they get acquainted among the toys in a playroom. The plot revolves around a holiday -- a chance for adults to play. There are plays on words. The Play is the Thing. Holiday is ultimately about the importance of play, in all its connotations: flexibility, acting out, silly behavior, continuous learning, freedom to be.\n\nIt is okay for adults to play sometimes, or do adults need &quot;permission&quot; to play?"

      "reviewBody": "As Wim Winders first feature, it certainly makes a unique impression, although not always a positive one. Entitled Summer in the City, virtually all the exterior shots have snow covered grounds,cars and streets. The main character even speaks of how the snow makes Berlin seem to be a ghost town. Even weirder are the relationships Hans seems to have with three different girls, all of whom are very attractive.In the first case, he calls to ask if he can stay over for a few days, which she agrees with. Later, after moving from Munich to Berlin, he simply appears in his friends&apos; apartments, playing an unknown board game in the first and being offered port wine in the second. There is never any hint of intimacy between him and any of the girls, and when he finally leaves the third one, there is five minutes or more of silent closeups of her in her rather modestly furnished apartment. Then, there&apos;s the music: notably by The Kinks (To whom the film is dedicated), the Lovin&apos;Spoonful, (whose song used for the title of the movie is played in its entirety), Bob Dylan (the first two cuts from his John Wesley Harding album) and many other rock and roll tunes from the late&apos;60s. Very often, the song has little if any apparent connection to what is transpiring on the screen at the time. And what it is that is transpiring for the majority of the films is movement: we see Hans being driven in a car, flying in an airplane, walking the streets and taking a train, all the time with a flowing montage of the passing street scenery. If nothing else, Winders proves he&apos;s a master of steady cam operation. The &apos;plot&apos; - Hans&apos; apparent attempts to stay clear of the associates he had before some unknown bad deed landed him in prison, is merely tangential at the most to the visual panoply of street scenes. And he smokes like a chimney! Very different, quite unique, but not all that inspiring.",

Hey, back off...it&apos;s a good start.\n\nAnyway, Van Dorn is vastly impressed and, with the aid of the machine, the pair set out to bring about the downfall of power-crazed Wade Barnett (Walter Miller) and his crony Dorgan (Dick Cramer), whose political-group activities, through a vicious smear campaign, had hounded Stanfield&apos;s father to death. Stanfield&apos;s efforts are complicated by the fact that his girlfriend, known to him as Gloria Grant (Ada Ince), is really Barnett&apos;s daughter, who has rejected her father and goes by an alias.\n\nWizard Van Dorn also stays busy inventing new gadgets to fight the gang with but, someway or another, he or Stanfield or Gloria always end up as the victim rather then Barnett, Dorgan or their henchies. Going back to the drawing board in chapter 10 (The Iron Death), Van Dorn comes up with a short-wave radio controlled robot and, in chapter 11 (The Juggernaut), he remotes it into a room to kill Barnett, but by mistake, the robot attacks Stanfield, who is tied helpless in a chair. Barnett was long gone.\n\nThey would have been better served by spending all their time and energy in trying to get rid of the shadow caused by the invisibility vest.\n\nToss in Ada Ince in the highest-budgeted film she ever made, and Edmund Cobb as a derby-hat wearing henchie (looking a lot like &quot;Doiby&quot; Dickles, the Green Lantern&apos;s cab-driving pal) and add Kenneth Strickfaden&apos;s art-deco lab and amazing electrical gadgets...and this becomes a Keeper."

Brooks&apos; attempt to instruct Crawford in the mysteries of the knack go hilariously awry when the pair encounter the flighty Rita Tushingham.\n\nI&apos;m a little surprised that this won a Palme d&apos;Or, but it IS very funny in a not-too over-the-top way. It&apos;s dramatically superior to contemporary early &apos;60&apos;s comedy, and the principals turn in wonderful performances. If you like it, be sure to check out Lester&apos;s sunny nonsense &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; and the distinctly darker &quot;How I Won the War.&quot;",

Takeshi also stars as Zatoichi, the elderly masseur and dice gambler whose hearing is so acute he can detect which side a die has fallen. He&apos;s a master swordsman, too  one slice and you&apos;re diced.\n\nSupporting characters include two beautiful geishas avenging their parents&apos; death, a farmer and her drunkard nephew, the gangsters running the town and a masterless samurai (an impressive performance from Tadanobu Asano).\n\nThe Blind Swordsman is great fun, although it could do with a tighter structure.

That&apos;s a shameful act for any responsible main stream actors and director. I am glad that Zinda is now under investigation for violation of copyright. Its about time now to stop this shameful piracy. Another thing is, Hindi movie don&apos;t have guts to go that extreme like jaw-dropper &quot;Old boy&quot;. Pathetic. They make movie according to the public taste, mostly rickshaw pullers. I wonder where they found in between the plot to plant some songs and crazy dance. Somebody really needs to tell bollywood artist that movie is a serious art business. There is a very bold thick red link between copy and adaptation, and Zinda is way far across the line.",

There are entire scenes in this movie in which the sound is so poorly handled that you can barely hear what characters are saying. This isn&apos;t helped by Anthony Michael Hall&apos;s decision to mumble all of his lines. He seemed very unenthusiastic about this role--like he could barely work up the energy even to say the words.\n\nThere is a scene in the film in which Hall&apos;s character and some friends have an impromptu football game on his girlfriend&apos;s front lawn, against her father (who hates Hall for some reason that is never explained) and some other boobs, that is so badly edited that you simply cannot tell what is happening. Characters come in and out of that scene without rhyme or reason--continuity errors abound. There are also many scenes in which weird dialog was looped in during post-production to bridge awkward narrative gaps. This is a sure sign that the director didn&apos;t really know what he was doing, and just failed to capture footage that made sense on its own.\n\nAlso, Robert Downey, Jr. is unbelievably obnoxious in this movie. I mean really disgusting."

It is one of three westerns that Gary Grimes starred in that gave a darker and truer view of life in the old west for teenager. The others are The Culpepper Cattle Co., 1972 and Cahill, U.S. Marshall, 1973.\n\nLee Marvin plays a wounded bank robber, (Spikes) on the run from a posse, whom three teens find (Grimes, Ron Howard and Charles Martin Smith) and nurse back to health. The three youths, small community and under the heavy hand of discipline, become enthralled with Spikes and soon strike out on their own soon after he departs.\n\nAfter a series of misadventures, the youngsters meet up with Spikes again, who, against his better judgment, takes them under his wing.\n\nThe Spikes Gang is a fast paced movie and seems to play upon the anonymity of three teenagers, ill-prepared for a brutal and unforgiving way of life. The one drawback to the pace is that it does not give a good sense for the passage of time, but is effective in emphasizing the few sparks in mundane lives.\n\nAs part of the Grimes Western trilogy, one can get a good look at an overly romanticized part of history.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Caché (Hidden)&quot; uses the visual power of film to create an escalating examination of contemporary paranoia and personal global responsibility the way Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s 1974 film &quot;The Conversation&quot; did with sound and fictional criminals. \n\nWriter/director Michael Haneke plays visual tricks on the audience as voyeurs from the opening shot, much as he did with &quot;Code Inconnu,&quot; as he coyly plays with technology, building on the pervasive surveillance potential of our times.\n\nThe comfortable upper middle class life of married intellectuals Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche is more and more disrupted by spooky video and drawings from some kind of stalker. With a bit heavy-handed constant background TV news coverage about terrorism and other violence in the MidEast, as well as too much irony that Auteuil works on TV (evidently in yet another book discussion show like the central narcissist in &quot;Look At Me (Comme une image)&quot;), race is quickly introduced as a flash point in contemporary Paris from a brief street confrontation and reinforced with Auteuil&apos;s flashback dreams of his youth.\n\nWhile the political angles are obvious, the Hitchcockian tension is very effectively built up (though not narratively resolved even as some secrets are revealed that lead to other inscrutabilities), not just as we see Auteuil repeatedly lie and Binoche practically disintegrate from nerves, but through sudden violence.\n\nWhile we never understand who all is lying and who isn&apos;t, the film further plays on the truth that visual images don&apos;t in fact communicate the reality of a situation and can be misleading about relationships, particularly once paranoia has destroyed trust. The film also raises the question if people change their behavior if they know they are being watched and that you can&apos;t really hide from your past. Cynically, but perhaps honestly as opposed to in &quot;Crash,&quot; here there is no easy resolution of acceptance of guilt and responsibility in personal lives any more than there is in the legacy of colonialism and racism.\n\nNot only is the past never dead, but the film keeps repeating issues of not just am I my brother&apos;s keeper, but the sins of the father are revisited on the sons, such that it&apos;s important to keep watching even as the credits start to appear at the end (there was much shouting when some folks got up to leave too soon, blocking cryptic clues to those behind them).\n\nThe subtitles are very poorly done, with many scenes having them white on white, instead of the much easier to read yellow.",

      "reviewBody": "How many times have you seen the words, &apos;Based on a true story,&apos; at the beginning of a Hollywood film? Normally, when that&apos;s written, what you see on screen is about as far away to what actually happened as you can possibly get. However, &apos;Fire in the Sky&apos; is almost quite close to what really happened (obviously, if you believe what the story is all about).\n\nTravis Walton was a logging worker in 1975 who, while up in the mountains, was abducted by a flying saucer right before his co-workers&apos; eyes. This is the account of what happened. One criticism is that it heavily favours the account of Walton and his co-workers, over those sceptical of their fantastical claim. However, when you think about it, Fire in the Sky would have been a pretty dull film if all that happened was Travis decided to hide in the woods for a few days while his mates made up crazy stories about what they&apos;ve seen.\n\nThis is a great film - kind of like a &apos;real life&apos; episode of the X-files. And, you can enjoy it on two levels: if you&apos;re a &apos;Mulder&apos; and believe in aliens, UFOs etc, you can look at it as a documented account of what actually happened. However, if you&apos;re a &apos;Scully&apos; (i.e. a sceptic) then you should be able to enjoy it by simply seeing it as a good piece of dramatic science-fiction.\n\nEither way, if you&apos;re into sci-fi or drama, you should quite enjoy it. It&apos;s also worth looking into further - the real Travis Walton wrote quite a comprehensive book on the subject matter and there&apos;s plenty of &apos;evidence&apos; to back up his claims if you do some research on the internet.",

      "reviewBody": "That&apos;s the word I&apos;d use to describe the film, an adaptation of Terry McMillan&apos;s 1992 best-seller. It&apos;s not great, it&apos;s not bad, but it&apos;s frustrating to watch, and the fact that I&apos;m of the male persuasion undoubtedly had something to do with it.\n\nNow, let me be the first to say that I did enjoy seeing a group of strong black women portrayed onscreen. To say that Hollywood has been exceedingly lax in this regard is an understatement. But it would&apos;ve been nice if their collective talents hadn&apos;t been squandered on this disgustingly anti-male tirade. Especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who otherwise shine in everything their names are attached to. Good, solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever, but not at the cost of shortchanging the good, upright, decent brothers out there, whom this movie largely forgets about (with some notable exceptions -- Gregory Hines, for example.)\n\nAnd the frustration doesn&apos;t end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters (a married man and a dope fiend, respectively), yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they&apos;ve been looking, even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women (&quot;the scum of the f__king earth&quot;, to quote Savannah), and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly, shallow reasons.\n\nIf it wasn&apos;t for Bassett, Devine, and Babyface&apos;s score, this movie would barely be watchable. As it is, it&apos;s a moderately entertaining diversion, albeit a frustrating one."

I had always wanted to see it again because it had left only good memories from when I was a teenager and watched it on German TV where it was very popular in the 70s. The main character is an evil rogue who outwits his pursuers by his skills in disguise and technical resources. The film (and its sequels) is based on a series of 1910s French pulp novels which have only sparsely been released in the U.S. (sadly unavailable in print right now). The novels influenced French surrealist and avant-garde artists/writers because of their fascination with moral transgression and black humor (a term coined by the surrealist Andre Breton in the 1930s). If you like slapstick comedy you will also enjoy Louis de Funes in the role of Inspector Juve. Sure, the film is badly made by today&apos;s standards and technically not as brilliant as the 1960s James Bond movies that it mocks--but, hey, at least the bad guy is smarter than the good ones, which is still refreshing to see compared to most oh-so-morally-PC Hollywood flicks today.\n\nEnjoy!",

Miss Astounding gets mixed up with some kidnappers (led by Kenne Duncan) and their victims on a secluded mountain range and gradually picks them off one by one until vanquished by a stalwart geologist (Robert Clarke). Ridiculous denouement suggests that our title monster was sent to Earth as an Emissary of peace. You could have fooled me.\n\nProduction values are strictly from hunger and the film has the amateurish look of a home movie.  Poorly edited and with horrible sound, it&apos;s a chore to sit through.  Although music is credited to an individual, the soundtrack sounds more like a collection of poorly matched library music cues.\n\nThis flick started the downward spiral of Clarke&apos;s movie career, which reached it&apos;s nadir with a string of films with world class hack Jerry Warren.  Warren no doubt used this production as inspiration for his &quot;ouerve&quot;.  Movies of this type have garnered a reputation for being &quot;So Bad, they&apos;re good!&quot;.

Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski in the true WWII story of three Jewish brothers who hid in the Belorussian forests and built a community of partisan fighters, saving over 1200 Jews by war&apos;s end.\n\nLiev Schreiber (Zus Bielski) and Jamie Bell (Asael Bielski) star alongside Craig as his two younger brothers. Both Craig and Schreiber give powerhouse performances as the older brothers competing for leadership, and Jamie Bell, who most recently starred in the abysmal Jumper, gives a surprisingly great performance as well. \n\nZwick has created one of the most beautiful and thought provoking films of his career and definitely one of the most Oscar worthy movies to hit cinemas in years. War and destruction has never been so captivating and moving. There have been dozens of war movies in recent years but none have left me caring so much or feeling so attached to the characters. My eyeballs wouldn&apos;t break from the screen for the full 120 mins, and by the film&apos;s end, I wasn&apos;t ready to stop watching. I can&apos;t wait for the release (which appears to be some time this winter) in order to see it again.\n\nIt&apos;s a superb film with a nice balance of heavy hitting action and intense drama, but if that&apos;s not enough to make you want to see it, just the fact that these on screen heroes existed in real life definitely make it worth the watch.\n\nThis is a WWII movie that doesn&apos;t hide or glamorize war but shows the intense reality of what happens when people band together against overwhelming evil and survive. \n\nA solid 8.5/10",

Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it&apos;s still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that&apos;s entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: &quot;Now why can&apos;t I write sh*t like that?&quot; I think it&apos;s unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.",

Much of the dismay of his of his creator Dr. Jeff Peters(Also John Malkovich). A good romantic comedy of it&apos;s time. Ann Magnuson is great. John Malkovich is terrific in duel roles has the sweet and sincere android Ulysses, and has the uptight and cynical Dr. Jeff Peters. A great movie to rent for your date."

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes its a good idea not to read up on a movie before watching it, it can set up an expectation (or lack of it) that interferes with viewing pleasure. In the newly released Masters of Cinema version the critic Tony Raines is highly dismissive in the introduction - calling it dramatically inert and making a few rather pompous and pedantic points about the translation. Donald Richie in his &apos;Hundred Years of Japanese Film&apos; is similarly dismissive. It is certainly not Mizoguchi&apos;s best, it lacks the flair of Ugetsu and the character development of his more contemporary dramas, but I think this movie is far better than the dismissive comments suggest. Maybe its just that Japanese cinema of the period is so fabulously rich that even very good movies can be discounted.\n\nThe story is taken from an ancient Chinese legend - of the beautiful concubine of a great emperor, sacrificed for the sins of her family. No doubt the Chinese setting looks rather ludicrous to Chinese viewers (it was originally a co-production with HK based company, but they seem to have had no artistic input), but thats hardly new - even Crouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger was hated by most mandarin speakers I know. And its probably no worse that the Last Samurai or Memoirs of a Geisha appears to the Japanese.\n\nIt was Mizuguchi&apos;s first colour film - while some commentators have praised the beauty of the camera-work, I must admit I was left a big cold by it - not a patch on (for example) Ozu&apos;s first colour experiments. It may be that the blame is the digital colour transfer or just my poor quality screen, but I think its more than that - I get the strong impression the movie was shot on a very tight budget - some of the sets look very fake compared to most Mizoguchi&apos; films I&apos;ve seen. I don&apos;t think the film makers were totally aware of how colour can show up fakery in a way they could get away with using black and white. In fact, the whole movie has a slightly throw away feel, as if Mizoguchi didn&apos;t fully have his heart in it. There are lots of opportunities for the sort of big sweeping scene he specialised in, but which aren&apos;t taken up here - I would guess that he simply didn&apos;t have the time and budget for it.\n\nBut I don&apos;t mean to criticise this too much - while the script is occasionally clunky, it is usually very moving and beautifully acted. The characters are vivid and while its a little bit much to believe that a great Emperor could be quite such a sappy soul, Mori and Kyo do a reasonable job in making their characters believable - or as believable as possible when translating such an ancient story. Kyo as always is wonderfully watchable. Mori is slightly less successful - he doesn&apos;t quite show the steel that much have existed under the cultured exterior of a man who ran an empire.\n\nSo while this film is certainly not a masterpiece by Mizoguchi, or one of the best movies of the period, its certainly superior to most contemporary costume dramas and well worth having to while away a rainy Sunday afternoon.",

He has been able to prove this and his filmography is an example to appreciate his vision on breaking old traditions with sexual undertones often thrown in.\n\nI never imagined to see his name linked to a title theoretically intended for children. I never wanted to see this, but finally watched only the live action sequences directed by Walter Hugo Khouri. It was weird to see the Brazilian singer Tetê Espíndola who is compared to Kate Bush dressed in funny costumes (Macaw, Jaguar). It feels like the director was taking a camp-like attitude, laid-back and shooting the scenes. There are gibberish shrieks in the songs which sounds like a poor version of Diamanda Galas.\n\nNevertheless, as someone who loves Walter Hugo Khouri, i&apos;m happy he didn&apos;t depart from his style and this was just a voluntary effort. It is quite a good discovery for his fans and definitely can give this one a chance.",

May be, the very special atmosphere of leading Soviet research institutes, the atmosphere of creativity and self-sacrifice, is one of a few positive contributions that communists have brought to the Russian culture. At least, the film of Mikhail Romm brings us to the wonderland, where people believe in what they do. Romm tells us a sad and beautiful story about an island of freedom, the island which is nowadays lost under the waters of &quot;real life&quot;.",

It was interesting enough, thankfully not too overlong, at just a little over 90 minutes, but dear god, that plot! I really tried to follow it but after awhile just kind of gave up. It&apos;s a ridiculous story but still intriguing enough if you like these 60s French gems. Delon&apos;s performance isn&apos;t great but who cares, he&apos;s Alain Delon, just look at his face. And Jane Fonda....oh wow, I believe this was the beginning of her journey into making sultry French films. I love Jane but this isn&apos;t her best performance or French movie. Check out &quot;The Game is Over&quot;, it&apos;s much better than this and Jane sparkles in it. But you should have fun with this one. Now all they need to do is release &quot;Circle of Love&quot;, the only one of Jane&apos;s French films that isn&apos;t available."

It&apos;s a just a &quot;ski film&quot; aimed at an audience of skiers, and as such it&apos;s among the best of the genre. Willy Bogner may be best-known these days for his line of ski clothes, but even many skiers are unaware of his reputation as a world-class skier and ski filmmaker. His camerawork and skiing were behind many of the spectacular skiing stunts in the James Bond films. None of the performers in &quot;Fire And Ice&quot; are actors per se. But the cast is a virtual Who&apos;s Who of the freestyle ski world in the 1980&apos;s. Their on-snow antics combine with Bogner&apos;s cinematography to make this a visual treat. The plot, such as it is, serves merely to move the story along. Don&apos;t look for high drama here. Just sit back and enjoy some amazing skiing and stunning mountain photography."

      "reviewBody": "The filmmakers of Flesh Gordon spent so much effort lovingly recreating the look and feel of the original Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s that they actually created a soft porn movie with real (if very modest) cinematic worth.  In fact, it&apos;s in some ways superior to the original Gordon flicks - particularly its special effects - with an extensive and surprisingly good use of stop-action animation.\n\nFortunately, sub-par acting is common in both porn and the old serials and this adds to the authentic feel of this parody.  But there is also some genuine acting going on too.  The best actors in the movie deliberately over-play their roles to wonderful effect.  Emperor Wang and Dr. Flexi Jerkoff brilliantly recreate the essence of Emperor Ming and Dr. Zarkov. Craig T. Nelson gives the voice of the monster a kind of laid back (yet lewd) sophistication.  It&apos;s a voice that reminds me of Bing Crosby, which makes the scene just plain weird.\n\nWhat makes this film work is that instead following the usual porn formula of using the plot as a mere device to show sex, Flesh Gordon uses sex as the fundamental source its humor, enthusiastically blending the rather banal soft-core porn of the seventies with the hackneyed storylines of the thirties.  The sex takes the hackney out of the story, and the story takes the banality out of the sex scenes.\n\nIs this movie a masterpiece?  Clearly... OBVIOUSLY... not.  But it is distinctive and original.  Flesh Gordon is an unusual case where the quite good and the very bad somehow manage to complement each other and average out to make a very entertaining movie."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m sure that not many people outside of Australia have ever heard of the legend of Ned Kelly. I once saw a documentary about the man, but that&apos;s the only time I once saw or heard anything about him. And I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. No-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Ned Kelly&apos;s life. The Irish immigrant has lived in north-west Victoria all his life, but has never been very welcome by the authorities. The police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family. When Kelly is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men. They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. All this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are outlawed. Finally they take over a pub in Glenrowan, where they have a party with all the visitors, waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up. But the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen...\n\nIt&apos;s very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false. I guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of Robin Hood, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief. I really couldn&apos;t tell you which of them is right, perhaps both are, but what I can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.\n\nThis movie was a nice addition to the documentary I once saw and I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are all actors who are pretty well known, but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.5/10",

      "name": "Film of two halves but both work well in different ways",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a little wary of films from Takashi Miike as, although they are generally received as good, my experience of them has been that they are bloody and very odd. Thirteen Assassins though seemed a bit more accessible in terms of being more straightforward, which in some ways then makes the violence a little easier to watch. The plot here sees the amoral behaviour of Lord Naritsugu infuriate a small group of men who, led by veteran samurai Shinzaemon, set out to trap him and his 100+ entourage of guards (led by samurai Hanbei) in order to kill him and end his rise to power for the greater good.\n\nThis plot essentially cuts the film in half. The first half of the film is the setup and is mostly dialogue driven. It is slow and patient but not dull as the main thing it does is to turn the main character (and the audience) against Naritsugu by virtue of the terrible things he has done. This is brutal and quite shocking in regards some of the things we see, half-see or view the aftermath of. At the same time it gives us some time to get to know the thirteen main characters; although there is an air of honour to all of them, the characters do have traits of humour, weakness, anger and so on, which mark them out but also add some colour to the telling. The second half of the film begins when the trap is sprung and a small village becomes a contained killing field soon to be filled with bodies and blood.\n\nI had wondered how I would find this because there was always the potential that action involving this size of a crowd would just be a mess of flailing and blood and that it wouldn&apos;t have any tension or flow to it. To a certain extent, this is a bit of a problem at times but mostly Miike overcomes it by splitting up the characters across the village and mixing smaller conflicts with bigger ones. You do still need to buy the sight of tired individual men cutting through a stream of 20 men but the narrative sort of makes this easy (it is a time of peace with a lower standard of samurai) but also it isn&apos;t all this type of action. It is bloody but without being overly gory for the sake of it. The delivery manages to make me believe the concept of the honourable death (not something I do normally) because of how dishonourable Naritsugu is and how likable Shinzaemon is throughout. The cast do well in this regard not only to make characters but also to remain distinguishable in the midst of the chaos and blood. Yakusho is strong in the lead and he contrasts well with Ichimura and Inagaki well; both of whom are also good even if Inagaki has a bit of an open goal in regards doing a simple amoral character. The supporting cast are good and mix their characters well with my favourite being Iseya who is fun and funny even if what his character represents sort of doesn&apos;t work for my western viewpoint.\n\nOverall though, Thirteen Assassins is an engaging film that has good build-up which explodes into chaos and violence for the second half. I don&apos;t think it is perfect but in fairness some of the problems I had with it came with the plot and the territory, so they are not failings so much as just part of the film."

Music is by Joseph LoDuca and cinematography by Phil Parmet.\n\nAugust the 11th 1879, the Dakota territories, and after a family of pioneers are abducted a posse is formed and go off in search of the culprits. It is believed they have fallen prey to hostile Native Americans, but once out in the wilds the truth hits home and the posse find themselves in a brutal and bloody fight for survival.\n\nIt&apos;s not like Tremors! That wonderful homage to the B movie creature features of the 1950s is played for laughs and action thrills. The Burrowers admittedly on plot synopsis&apos; does lend one to think that a fun packed creature feature is in the offering, but as many unaware film fans have found out, this is far from being the case.\n\nI would rather walk in the right direction than ride with my head up my ass.\n\nThe Burrowers takes itself seriously, and not insultingly so. J.T. Petty wanted to make a Horror/Western but not in the schlocky sense. He even infuses the narrative with some human concerns and statements, ecologically and racially so.\n\nThe pace is very, very deliberate, so potential first time viewers need to take that into consideration. Once the plot is kick started in the opening salvo, the posse go out into the wilds and interact, for better and worse, dialogue is sharp and pointed, intelligent even.\n\nA number of great character based scenes are setting the tone for what is a downbeat picture, while when the action comes in tantalising spurts, it&apos;s well marshalled by Petty, and it&apos;s not just all about the creatures either.\n\nThe look is of a classical Western, which considering the modest budget is quite some achievement. From costuming and props, to the colour palette, the film convinces as the Old West of 1879. In this regard it would have been very interesting to have seen Petty make a standalone Oater.\n\nPractical effects are very decent and CGI is wisely used sparingly, though the big showdown at pic&apos;s end is something of a let down. Elsewhere Sir Clancy of Brown and Doug The Thug Hutchison are sadly under written, though the face fuzz department scores high marks!\n\nA tricky one to recommend to either Horror or Western fans, but for atmosphere and a great sense of period - and no little amount of originality as well, it&apos;s worth checking out as long as you don&apos;t expect Tremors. 7/10",

Upon his return to his hometown with some gifts and the money he had saved for his family, Mehrollah was furious and confused to find the fact that his mother had remarried to a policeman and lived in a new home.\n\nAlthough the policeman was a man of kind-hearted, Mehrollah refused to accept him to be his step-father. Mehrollah refused to go home to live with the new change, instead, he decorated and stayed in the old house that used to be his birth-father&apos;s.\n\nMehrollah tried everything to fight against his step-father, and even worse, he stoled the police-hand-gun from his step-father and ran away to a far away town. The policeman was mad and rode on his motocycle to the town, and caught Mehrollah.\n\nOn the home-bound road, they had a hard time lost in the wide desert and had to give up their broken-down motocycle. They walked on helplessly, thirsty and starving. The boy and his new father began to help each other under the hardship, and started a new relationship...\n\nDirector Majid Majidi is an expert who knows how to tell a simple story with deep meaning, with excellent camera language and very little dialogue.\n\nThis movie is calm and beautiful.",

      "name": "A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Bertolucci&apos;s requiem for unrequited Love",
      "reviewBody": "Bernardo Bertolucci&apos;s Last Tango in Paris simultaneously mocks and mourns the human yearning for love and companionship. The movie is a requiem for unrequited love, and a testament to the proclivity of humans to surrogate love with lust when trapped in a maelstrom of despondence, chagrin, and compunction. Bertolucci&apos;s purpose is not to glorify carnality as a virtue or to scorn it as a vice, but is to use it as an instrument to authenticate the veritable existence of a dark, ugly, and bestial side of humanity, which is so often suppressed and hypocritically denied in similar works on the subject. Bertolucci&apos;s penchant for art is limitless and he uses it to full effect in order to give the movie an aesthetic feel while simultaneously catering to the movie&apos;s explorative, earthy, and unconventionally bold motifs. Bertolucci uses his characters uncannily as a medium to foray into unexplored realms of human psyche while unflinchingly projecting them as objects of desire, disgust and depravity. Bertolucci pushes Brando and Schneider to a limit where they are not only forced to compromise their egos but also relinquish their pride, and I say that not as an offence but as an appreciation for his talent as a movie-maker. Renowned film critic Pauline Kael bestowed the film with the most ecstatic endorsement of her career, writing, &quot;Tango has altered the face of an art form. This is a movie people will be arguing about for as long as there are movies.&quot; American director Robert Altman expressed unqualified praise: &quot;I walked out of the screening and said to myself, &apos;How dare I make another film?&apos; My personal and artistic life will never be the same.&quot; Eminent critic Roger Ebert has added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; collection.\n\nThe movie presents an episode in the lives of two loners residing in Paris: Paul, a recently widowed, middle-aged American businessman, and Jeanne, a young, voluptuous, soon-to-be-married Parisian girl. The two accidentally meet up in an empty apartment available for rent, and a steamy affair ensues between the two on strictly anonymous basis. Paul is very discreet about his identity and whereabouts and even cajoles Jeanne to religiously follow the protocol. Paul sees Jeanne as a carnal surrogate for his deceased wife, while Jeanne finds in Paul a lover which her fiancé could never become. The two continue to meet and serve each other at regular intervals while also going about their regular business. Their sexually charged up affair, despite a disconnect at the emotional level, satiates them both beyond expectations, and resonates to the viewer an ineffable sense of frenzy and euphoria that holds him in a vice-like grip for the entire length of the movie. The dramatically botched, anti-climactic ending of the movie, which has been snubbed by critics, still manages to testify the axiomatic consistency of change in packing a punch stronger than the modern-day gimmicks. \n\nMarlon Brando gives an inciteful, poignant, tour de force performance as the reclusive widower. Many people called Brando a chameleon, but I would call him a chameleon who hated his camouflage; a prodigy who detested his talent; a narcissist who abhorred himself for being a mortal. Brando as Paul is a cross between a sadist and a masochist. He uses every ounce of his talent to conjure up his menacing alter-ego. Driven by guilt and chagrin, Paul&apos;s sociopathic self is a nightmare for those around him. Roger Ebert wrote about Brando&apos;s performance: &quot;It&apos;s a movie that exists so resolutely on the level of emotion, indeed, that possibly only Marlon Brando, of all living actors, could have played its lead. Who else can act so brutally and imply such vulnerability and need?&quot; The scene in which Paul confronts the dead body of his wife, who has committed suicide, is probably the most powerful scene ever filmed in cinema. It not only depicts the complexities associated with Paul&apos;s character but also highlights the dichotomy he suffered owing to his dual emotions of rage and grief. \n\nMaria Schneider is innocent, charming, voluptuous and pitiful in her portrayal of Jeanne, a Parisian girl whose life is devoid of true love. Schneider, being fully aware of her limitations as an actor, incredibly manages to give a performance that is singular and effective enough not to be adumbrated by Brando&apos;s sublime, over-the-top portrayal. \n\nThe cinematography of the movie is vivid, elaborative, and expressive and is well complemented by the movie&apos;s sensuously evocative background score. \n\nPS. Last Tango in Paris is a profoundly disturbing case-study of human emotions and is a must for cineastes worldwide, but can only be savoured by eschewing bigotry, prejudice, and conservatism. 9/10\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners&apos; sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn&apos;t even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).\n\nAll this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.\n\nDirector Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.\n\nThe comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.\n\nThere isn&apos;t much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn&apos;t fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers&apos; imitation was misplaced.\n\nThis film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg&apos; Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.\n\nThis film won&apos;t be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren&apos;t amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren&apos;t a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",

The novel was the first best seller of Mexico, and also this movie was an American Super Production (in that time). It also is the mother of a legend of Mexican dramas, and the fichera&apos;s movies. Considered as a jewel, Santa makes you understand why Mexican cinematographers made a whole genre of it, the kind of teatrical drama, whores as incredible &quot;pure woman&quot;, and Mexico as a producer of their films.

Making a sequel to this sort of material is a struggle. Perhaps they should have stopped after one movie?\n\nThe other reviewers have pointed out what is wrong with Future World so I will point out what is right with it. There is an oddly touching goodbye scene between a less important park worker and his defective faceless robot pal. This scene and a few other moments make Future World worth watching."

      "name": "A laughter-bonanza from the Tragedy King",
      "reviewBody": "Though Dilip Kumar was labelled as the Tragedy King of Hindi cinema, he was quite skilled in comedy too. Today I am reviewing a movie which is a showcase of his comic talent. It&apos;s a classic movie which became a pioneer for twins-based stories in Hindi cinema later. This movie is Ram Aur Shyam (1967) which features Dilip Kumar in contrasting twin roles - one is a weak, coward and submissive person whereas the other one (the twin) is a daredevil and smart person. It&apos;s the latter which provided Dilip Kumar an opportunity to make the audience laugh and he did it with such finesse that till date his performance in this role is quoted as a classic comic performance.\n\nRam Aur Shyam is the story of twins who got separated in their childhood and brought up in utterly different environments leading to development of completely opposite personalities of them. Ram (Dilip Kumar) grows up in a rich household which remains under the tyranny of Gajendra (Pran) whereas Shyam (Dilip Kumar in double role) grows up in a village with the affection of Ganga Mausi (Leela Mishra) and the childhood teasings of Shaanta (Mumtaaz). For Ram also, the love of his affectionate sister-in-law - Sulakshana (Nirupa Roy) and niece - Kuku (Baby Farida) is there but they are helpless before Gajendra. Gajendra is greedy too and he decides to marry Ram to Anjana (Waheeda Rehman) who is the daughter of a wealthy man (Nazir Hussain) for the sake of getting a hefty dowry. Now comes the principle twist in the tale which forms the backbone of the story.\n\nDestiny takes Ram to the house of Shyam and vice-versa. Now Ram who has always been getting bashed and humiliated by Gajendra, gets warmth, love and respect too. Shaanta finds his &apos;Shyam&apos; to have changed into a shy and submissive person and instead of teasing him (as she has always done to the real Shyam), she starts loving him. On the other side, Shyam enters the house of Gajendra as Ram and his daredevil activities prove to be a pleasant surprise for Sulakshana, Kuku and the servants of the house and on the other hand a nightmare for Gajendra whom he bashes like anything. He happens to meet Anjana and her parents and falls in love. Anjana also starts loving him and she is quite happy to be the fiancée of &apos;Ram&apos;. The reality comes before everyone in the climax and the fact of Ram and Shyam being twins is also known to render a happy ending to the movie.\n\nRam Aur Shyam was a pioneer movie in Bollywood because it paved the way for follow-ups like Seeta Aur Geeta (1972) starring Hema Malini in lead role, Jaise Ko Taisa (1973) starring Jeetendra in lead role, Chaalbaaz (1989) starring Sridevi in lead role etc., the stuff being the same, i.e., twins separated in childhood and nurtured in entirely different environments to grow up into entirely opposite kind of individuals. However the comedy Dilip Kumar did as Shyam in Ram Aur Shyam could not be repeated by anybody, may it be Hema Malini or Jeeendra or Sridevi. Ram Aur Shyam can be watched any number of times to watch the brilliant comedy presented by the actor who is contradictorily known as the Tragedy King of Indian cinema.\n\nDilip Kumar is the heart and soul of this movie and he has done well in the submissive role of Ram too. Both the leading ladies alongwith the supporting characters have also done satisfactorily. Nirupa Roy as the sister-in-law of Ram and Baby Farida as her daughter and Ram&apos;s niece deserve special mention. Other than Dilip Kumar, if someone has made his presence prominently felt in this movie, it&apos;s none other than the most dreaded and notirious baddie of Bollywood cinema - Pran.\n\nNaushad has composed great music for this movie with the beautiful lyrics coming from the pen of Shakeel Badayuni. Two songs are immortal - Aaj Ki Raat Mere Dil Ki Salaami Le Le (Rafi) and Aayi Hain Bahaaren Mitay Zulm-o-Sitam (Rafi, Lata and chorus). Other songs - O Baalam Tere Pyar Ki Thandi Aag Mein Jalte Jalte (Rafi-Asha), Iss Nagari Ki Reet Hai Ulti (Asha-Mahendra Kapoor), Aaj Sakhi Ri More Piya Ghar Aaye (Asha and chorus), Maine Kab Tumse Kaha Tha Ki Mujhe Pyar Karo (Lata), Main Hoon Saaki Tu Hai Sharaabi Sharaabi (Lata) etc. are also good to listen (and to watch as well). Choreography in Aayi Hain Bahaaren Mitay Zulm-o-Sitam is just outstanding and it&apos;s a treat to watch this song on the screen.\n\nTechnical and production value aspects of the movie are all in order. The length of the movie is nowhere felt while watching because the complete movie is very interesting from beginning to end and at no place even an ounce of boredom has been allowed to creep in.\n\nAll in all, Ram Aur Shyam is a highly entertaining movie which should not be missed by either the fans of Dilip Kumar or the movie buffs in general. Those who have seen its remakes like Seeta Aur Geeta, Jaise Ko Taisa or Chaalbaaz should also watch it for getting a different kind of entertainment rendered by the Tragedy King&apos;s comic timing.",

Godzilla&apos;s first squaring off with another creature is the result of a script that originally pitted King Kong against Frankenstein&apos;s monster that Toho got their hands on and retooled for their marquee monster that they were discovering they could bring back repeatedly without turning off their Japanese and American audiences. They also brought back the original filmmaker behind Godzilla, Ishiro Honda, though without his original writing partner, choosing instead to use Shinichi Sekizawa, one of two writers who had become Honda&apos;s regular partner. The result is what one might expect from this period of Toho monster movies: thin, a bit (though not incredibly) silly, and with an effort to make another kind of movie in there somewhere.\n\nThe head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals, Mr. Tako (Ichiro Arishima), has decided that his media and advertising contract is not performing to standards, so he demands that the television studio create a sensation to up their ratings which should lead to more sales of the company&apos;s drugs. Here is the heart of the film, the satiric look at the Japanese television industry and its quest for ratings no matter what, and it&apos;s probably where the film works best. It&apos;s unfortunate that Sekizawa wasn&apos;t a good enough writer to bring it into the whole of the film, picking it up and dropping it from time to time as other types of film dominate for large sections of the film, but Mr. Tako doing everything he can to push the reporters into making things sensational across the action of the film provides some solid chuckles here and there.\n\nSakurai (Tadao Takashima) and Furue (Yu Fujiki) end up being sent to Faro Island (also the name of the place Ingmar Bergman called home for decades, but it has to just be a coincidence, right?) to investigate a mysterious spirit that the locals live in fear of. Yes, it&apos;s King Kong. They witness him battling a giant octopus and then getting so drunk that he falls asleep in a ceremony the locals provide him, giving them the perfect opportunity to get the Japanese boating crew to tie him up and lash him to a giant raft. Where the original King Kong outright ignored how to move a giant ape from one side of the world to the other, King Kong vs. Godzilla embraces it, and the sight is always inherently silly. Granted, the raft sight isn&apos;t hilarious (though the combination of man-in-suit and water just doesn&apos;t mesh all that well), there&apos;s a moment late where they transport him by giant balloon that is just...kind of hilarious.\n\nMeanwhile, at the same time, Godzilla has decided to awaken for no reason at all, heating up the ice prison that he was trapped in at the end of Godzilla Raids Again, and he heads straight for Japan. This (so far) short series has developed a little tic of bringing back scientific characters from the previous entry to explain the science or behavior of Godzilla in the new one. Takashi Shimuri had a cameo in Godzilla Raids Again after his near-star role in Godzilla, and this time it&apos;s Dr. Shigezawa (Akihiko Hirata), who was also in Godzilla, to appear in a couple of scenes and explain Godzilla&apos;s behavior. I mean, for this weird little series in the 60s, the commitment canon is surprising.\n\nAnyway, the two monsters have a fight, but King Kong is bested by Godzilla, leading to a retreat, some business with a girl being kidnapped by the giant ape, drugging it based on the stuff it got drunk off of on Faro Island, and then transporting him to face Godzilla again when the scientists decide that despite Kong losing his first battle maybe a day before, Kong is definitely strong enough now. It&apos;ll help if he gets miraculously struck by lightning to make him much more stronger at a down moment, too.\n\nSo, it&apos;s silly. There is some more character stuff around Sakurai&apos;s sister and Furue&apos;s fiancée (I might have mixed those up, but it just doesn&apos;t matter in the least), Fumiko (Mie Hama), but she&apos;s forgotten for long sections in favor of bits of satirical comedy around Mr. Tako and monster mash action. Focusing more purely on the satirical elements would have been a net-positive, I think.\n\nEiji Tsuburaya&apos;s special effects are, once again, the star of the show, but I have to say that he repeated the decision to play monster action quickly here like he did (supposedly accidentally) in Godzilla Raids Again. Moving these guys quickly makes them feel smaller, not bigger, and it makes the action itself inherently sillier. So, the suits are mostly pretty good (Godzilla is pretty good, Kong looks...not great, to be honest), and there&apos;s this wonderful continued embrace of miniature destruction. However, I just wish Tsuburaya had gone back to how to film kaiju from his first effort rather than his second.\n\nSo, it&apos;s fine. It&apos;s an excuse to pit Godzilla against another monster. The character stuff works slightly better this time than most because it has that satirical edge, even if it doesn&apos;t really go very far. So, it&apos;s decent, on the brighter side of this kind of film in this era. It entertains slightly. It&apos;s just, you know, not good.",

The performances are magnificent, and at the time, I found Tom Bell to be quite attractive. I later went off him when he was successively portrayed as a seedy villainous type. The thing which completely mesmerised me at the time was the music (Brahms First Piano Concerto). I haven&apos;t read any other comments about the music and I am interested to know if anyone else was as affected by it as I was. It is, of course, a fabulous piece but this was my first introduction to it. I was a music student in 1962 but in common with many other music students of the time, not very knowledgeable. I immediately became very passionate about this piece."

Adam Copeland (Edge) who played the maverick cop did a nice and natural performance in this film. but i have to say that Jamie Kennedy who played the tight-arse asst. d.a. actually saved the whole movie. he performed extremely well in this movie. watching him suffered so much and so many tormented moments in this movie almost made the audiences pity him. there were some dialog that was so funny to reflect adam copeland&apos;s real marriage history: divorced twice, just like the role he played, the dialog made him say that he already got two ex and he know what his nemesis asst. d.a. said about the divorce and the limited time to visit kids. a dialog subtly matching the real life of a character was indeed a nice touch. i kinda enjoyed this movie except the ending seemed to be a bit rush and forced."

Indeed, it had an interesting story which was presented very well and had some pretty good laughs without trying too hard. It&apos;s very good as a comedy, but as a drama it&apos;s somewhat bland. The characters don&apos;t connect to each other on a dramatic level and you really don&apos;t feel for them, but they are still entertaining to watch. Some parts had potential to be deep, and I think Pierre Brault could have pulled it off. Dan Lalande didn&apos;t do it for me in the dramatic sense but I did like him when he wasn&apos;t supposed to have emotion. He reminded me of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty in a way. I think it could have worked better, but overall a pretty nice movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I well remember PT 109 coming out in movie theaters during the summer of 1963. It was still playing in the hinterlands when the events of November 22, of that year occurred.\n\nProbably Cliff Robertson wisely decided not to try for a Boston accent in his portrayal of the 35th president of the United States during his World War II years. If he had he might have come off as imitating Vaughn Meader imitating John F. Kennedy. As it is the only concession he made to the role was a bit of reddish tint in his hair to suggest the man he was playing. It worked rather well and still works today.\n\nIronically though had their been other U.S. Navy craft near the PT 109 when the Japanese battleship Amagiri sliced it like a loaf of bread in the middle of the night who could have picked up survivors, Lieutenant j.g. John F. Kennedy probably would have been facing a court martial for losing his boat that way. It was the only PT boat in World War II lost to the Japanese in that manner.\n\nBut the story is not about that as it was the survival of all, but two of his crew who were killed in the collision. It&apos;s about Lieutenant Kennedy towing an injured man while swimming for a deserted Pacific island and keeping his men alive until they could be rescued. The Navy was not about to court martial a hero.\n\nWarner Brothers filled out the rest of the cast with some tried and true players, some like Ty Hardin and Grant Williams from their television series which was rapidly taking over the Warner Brothers lot. Particularly I liked James Gregory as the career naval officer in charge of the PT squadron and Michael Pate as Australian coast watcher Reg Evans. This is one of the few American made films where Michael Pate plays someone from his own country.\n\nI remember on Jack Paar&apos;s Friday night variety show he devoted an entire hour to one long commercial for this film. He reunited all of the surviving PT 109 survivors with Australian coast watcher Reg Evans who had a big hand in rescuing them. Evans had met Kennedy of course, but had never met the rest of the crew. The whole living crew was there except the skipper who was in the White House and who could know he&apos;d be the next one to die.\n\nIf JFK had lived and been running for re-election in 1964 what a great piece of election propaganda PT 109 would have been. The story also had a lot to do with his successful campaign in 1960. Kennedy was running under the cloud of his father Joseph P. Kennedy being a supporter of appeasement back in the day. This story and the death of his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. in combat in the European theater blunted a lot of the criticism of the actions of his father.\n\nPT 109 is a nicely done war film and a great piece of nostalgia for the Kennedy years.",

      "reviewBody": "And we&apos;re not talking about quite bad, but very bad. There are three reasons why Supercollider isn&apos;t rated any lower. The concept is a good one, plus it doesn&apos;t feel as stereotypical as it could have been in comparison to other relatively similar disaster movies. There are moments of nice locations, and the music is a step above the generic, overbearing and ponderous music that you&apos;d kind of expect from a movie in the genre that is low on budget, it&apos;s actually driven and atmospheric. The photography and editing can be choppy however, around the halfway mark there was some real sloppiness, one too many scenes were too darkly lit and the movie looked like too often that it was set in a refurnished basement. The script does suffer from clichéd writing- though thankfully not as badly as other movies seen recently, particularly on the SyFy channel- and it is never here the sort of writing that grabs you or stop you from rolling your eyes. A lot of it was stilted and ham-fisted. The story does have a twist and it wasn&apos;t completely predictable from start to finish. What it was though was very dull and by-the-numbers with no heart, fun or tension, everything just felt indifferent. To be honest, I was losing interest by the half-way mark but being the sort of person who never judges a film without seeing the whole of it stuck, with it. And the second half didn&apos;t improve, if anything it was the opposite. The direction is far too slack with no attempt to keep things tightly paced and taut. The characters are barely developed, charisma-free and just don&apos;t engage. The actors look as though they didn&apos;t want to be there or that they didn&apos;t care for what they&apos;d been given. Robin Dunne especially gives an expressionless and one-note lead performance. So to conclude, not terrible but another movie that joins the long line of movies that had good ideas but bad execution. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Have made no secret in the past of intensely disliking, and even outright hating a lot, a vast majority of The Asylum&apos;s (near-universally maligned for good reason) output, though there is curiosity as to whether they are capable of making something good and compulsive about their output&apos;s badness. Admittedly, The Asylum do have a small group of watchable films and the occasional (big emphasis on that word) above average one, unfortunately outweighed by the lacklustre at best and often dreadful films they churn out.\n\nAfter seeing &apos;Martian Land&apos;, giving it a fair chance and trying to not let bias get the better of me, as much as it actually pains me to say it do agree with everybody else who not only found it an awful film but also one of The Asylum&apos;s worst. Very much the same as what was said about &apos;Alien Convergence&apos; and a few other Asylum efforts seen recently. One of their most amateurish and intelligence-insulting certainly, all their trademark flaws are here in &apos;Martian Land&apos;.\n\nJust for the record, giving a film the lowest possible rating is incredibly rare for me these days, trying to be a fair reviewer trying to see the good in everything viewed. That rating is only reserved for films etc. that look like no effort or heart was put into it and like nobody was trying, a cardinal sin in film but actually not committed all that often. &apos;Martian Land&apos; is one of the worst examples of this in recent memory.\n\nVisually, &apos;Martian Land&apos; looks incredibly cheap even for something made on a low budget. It&apos;s very drably and sometimes dizzyingly shot, incoherently edited (bacon-slicer-like) with glaring and unforgivably sloppy continuity errors and even the scenery doesn&apos;t make much impression despite being actually the least bad aspect of the film. Even worse are some of the most laughable and pathetic-looking special effects to be seen on celluloid, actually looking they were done as an afterthought and on the small remainder of the money they had left.\n\nCan remember little about the music, which tended to be intrusive, annoying and out of place. The dialogue is utter gibberish and truly juvenile and unnatural, even by The Asylum standards and even in their best efforts the script is one of the weaker assets. How it was approved beyond first draft, or suggesting ideas stage, is beyond comprehension.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing thrilling, tense, suspenseful, emotionally investable or fun about the story. The predictability may have been forgivable if the film was actually engaging let alone exciting but it fails to be either throughout. Lets not get started on how insultingly nonsensical and ridiculous it is, things similarly are so vague and confused that coherence was also a major issue in places. The conflict had no urgency, imagination, fun or menace at all, it was all just dull and dumb.\n\nAs sort of expected, as it is a trademark of The Asylum it seems, there are illogical and irritating character behaviours that makes one endear to them even less in a film with not one interesting or rootable character. There is not one halfway decent performance either, almost like they weren&apos;t even trying.\n\nOverall, awful with nothing redeeming about it, except that it is not quite as blatantly derivative as other Asylum efforts. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Goodbye Bafana is a touching, thought-provoking movie. Extremely well acted, I loved Joseph Fiennes (James Gregory) and Dennis Haysbert (Nelson Mandela) in their roles, and Diane Kruger (Gloria Gregory) did well, too. The movie has the slow, a bit mysterious charm in it, as August&apos;s movies usually do. The color scheme was like African dust, diluted, sometimes almost raw in the scorching sun. Music supported various scenes very well, without being too prominent.\n\nThe movie starts when a young prison warden James Gregory arrives to Robben Island 1968 and is addressed to keep an eye on Nelson Mandela, who is being imprisoned there for his political views. Gregory gets this mission, because he speaks xhosa, the local language, and therefore is able to read (and censor) the correspondence in and out of the prison, as well as understand what the prisoners talk to each other.\n\nJames Gregory is a faithful supporter of apartheid. He believes these black men are behind bars for a good reason and he supports the government politics. After he and his family witness a raid in a busy street, where black people are randomly harassed, Gregory has to answer the questions of his children - and his explanations sounded shallow even in his own ears. Very slowly, over the years, he became to see through the apartheid and change his views.\n\nDennis Haysbert was chosen to the role of Mandela, because of his quiet, distinctive charm and mental power. He did a great job. Joseph Fiennes was chosen because Bille August wanted an actor, who was tough and yet sensitive, someone who would be able to portray the change in the character in a period of almost thirty years. It was a very challenging role but Joe did a marvelous job.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about his South African accent, and mostly it has been praised. I followed it very closely, and I think Joe did fine in that area, too. In some scenes the British accent is more or less audible, but most of the time he does a wonderful job.\n\nDiane Kruger did a good job as James&apos;s wife, a mother of two, who was also raising their kids to support the apartheid. She opposed her husband being a warden for Nelson Mandela, because she could see that the close contact with the inmate made cracks to James&apos;s shield and his racistic opinions were vanishing rapidly. She tried to hold onto the apartheid views for much longer than her husband.\n\nThe movie ends to a year 1990, when Nelson Mandela is released from prison after being incarcerated for 27 years. The era of the new South Africa was to begin.",

      "reviewBody": "The description of this movie didn&apos;t sound quite that interesting to me, but I thought I&apos;d give it a try anyway. It turned out to be a fairly decent film. For me once the movie was done, it evoked the sensation one gets when holding one mirror up to another and trying to see how many layers into the reflection you can manage to see - a reflection inside a reflection inside a reflection (etc... etc... etc... ad nauseum). Not in a visual sense, but an abstract one - You have the real director of the film making a movie about a director of a film who is inspired to complete the production of a film where the &quot;real&quot; director of that &quot;real&quot; (movie-world) film was making a movie about a director who used movie-making as a pretext for trapping and killing his victims.\n\nIt sounds much more complex in writing than it actually carries across on film. All of the actors in this did a very decent job - one of the hardest things for an actor to do afaic is to play the role of a character that is written to be a bad actor. The better the real actor is at it, the more truly &quot;bad&quot; their role would be acted. All of the actors here were fairly well up- to-snuff on their skills and seemed to manage the layered complexity of the plot quite well.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this is the way in which they set up the ending so early on. It&apos;s not something you realize until after you&apos;ve seen the ending, but once you have, you realize that a mere one or two lines of dialog spoken in the early half of the film pretty much sealed the fate of some of the more tragic characters. I can&apos;t give details without spoilering it, but I can say it was set up quite nicely and very subtly - sometimes a director virtually hits you over the head with a brick to get you to notice &quot;foreshadowing&quot;, but this one didn&apos;t do that.\n\nThere were quite a few f-bombs for those who mind, not any real noticeable nudity and the gore factor was really rather low. But it was an engaging story and an easy watch. It&apos;s a fairly decent addition to the growing number of pseudo &quot;reality film&quot; mockumentaries, particularly if you like psychological puzzlers.",

However, once in Paris, he misses Julia, and phones many times along the Christmas night to her. Frank is not brilliant, is unable to read a Stephen King&apos;s novel, but he is a sex machine in bed, giving sexual pleasure to Julia. Julia seems to be decided to break with Frank and stay with Christian, but her sexual desire does not allow her to come up to a decision. This weird and erotic German movie about a triangle of love has good performances and direction, but the story does not work very well. `Sexy Lover&apos; has the same premise (a woman dating more than one man, having troubles to decide who would be the `man of her life&apos;), and is an excellent black humor movie. The genre of `Stille Nacht&apos; is not well defined, and in the end, it is lost among erotic, romance, drama and comedy. Having a better screenplay, it could have been a great movie. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `Confissões na Noite&apos; (`Confessions in the Night&apos;)",

The house is an obvious metaphor for the region and the Israelis, of course, are played as the brutish unsympathetic occupiers pushing the poor Palestinians out of their home. The Palestinian family members, with their differing views, are obviously meant to represent the various Palestinian viewpoints. We get it. The metaphor is as subtle as a hammer blow to the head.\n\nThis is just more pro Palestinian revisionist history propaganda. Most pro Palestinians either just hate Israel or got their history from the internet. Thinking you are informed on an issue is a lot easier that taking the time and effort to really be informed, as in researching all sides.\n\nIt&apos;s funny in a sad way that most films that claim to show an even handed view of a conflict always seem to be biased in one way or another.",

Christopher Columbus is portrayed as a petulant adventurer who has an idea for sale, and is looking for a buyer. After a buyer is found and is expedition launched, his problems only escalate. The problem with the movie is its superficial portrayal of a complex character. The movie seems to gloss over some of the most momentous moments in history. They&apos;re mentioned, but that&apos;s about all. The geopolitical consequences of Columbus&apos;s achievement are barely mentioned. The Spanish court is also treated in a rather offhanded manner. The king and his ministers are portrayed as petulant fools; the only person with depth is Queen Isabella, who takes a liking to Columbus. The movie tells a story but that&apos;s about all. It lacks depth and fails to dramatize the truly momentous aspect of Columbus&apos;s voyage. Christopher Columbus was a great explorer whose achievement rates a movie of commiserate quality. Even the scenes showing Columbus being arrested fail to fully convey the sense of tragedy and defeat that marked the final years of Columbus&apos;s career.",

A couple of naughty boys discover the stored set of valuable organ pipes from a church being restored. They nick a few pipes just for the hell of it. Unfortunately the theft is reported resulting in unforeseen circumstances.\n\nAlthough not a great film it is still enjoyable with good acting by the young cast. My only complaint deals with the quality of the subtitles of my copy of the film; it is absolutely terrible, and gives the impression that a non-English speaking person &apos;translated&apos; it directly with only the use of a dictionary. The result is that this rather serious film is transformed into a pythonesque, surreal and at times unintended very funny belly full of laughs. Some examples: &quot;Paul, you&apos;re lucky that you drill to have no conscience&quot;. Also the mystifying &quot;Dead cert killer will be out of tune.&quot; It would be unfair to penalize the film for the poor quality of subtitles that were clearly added years later. I still score this interesting film 7/10.",

Sadly, &apos;Deewane Huye Paagal&apos; is a letdown by very silly jokes, characters, dialog and mediocre direction.\n\nThe film begins ably, but loses energy 60-minutes in the film. The culmination is the biggest downer. It&apos;s plain bad. Bhatt is a pro when it comes to making Horror films, and after watching this film, your assured that Comedy isn&apos;t his favorite dish.\n\nIn the acting department, Shahid Kapoor is mechanical. One could&apos;ve never imagined that he would transform into a caliber that would even nod a film like &apos;Kaminey&apos; and perform superbly. An actor who has taken Giant Strides! Akshay Kumar is over-the-top, but that&apos;s the demand of the character. Sunil Shetty is good. Rimi Sen looks stunning and plays her part nicely. Paresh Rawal hams. Johnny Lever is his usual self. Vijay Raaz stands out, a true scene-stealer. Vivek Oberoi&apos;s interpretation of a Narrator is an eye-sore.\n\nOn the whole, not much left to talk about. Verdict: Strictly Average!",

      "reviewBody": "Funny thing about watching a movie like &quot;Chicago&quot;, which won the award for Best Picture last year. I eagerly awaited the DVD, and when I first sat down to watch it, I didn&apos;t finish it. I guess I just wasn&apos;t in the mood. I began to wonder what all the hoopla was about. Now, a couple of weeks later, I watched it from the beginning and now I &quot;get&quot; it. I must have been in a different mood, because this time everything &quot;clicked&quot; for me, it was great fun, simply a very entertaining movie. Now I&apos;m glad I own the DVD, aside from my desire to have as many Oscar winners as I can. The whole story is a parody of fame, crime, and use of a slick lawyer to fool a jury. I will enjoy watching it again and again.\n\nMy favorite scene was where Gere&apos;s lawyer was puppetteer to Zellweger&apos;s Roxie, the acting, the singing, the timing were all just perfect. It has been well-publicized that Zellweger neither sang nor danced professionally before &quot;Chicago&quot;, and I found her more than adequate for the role of Roxie. In fact, I quite enjoy her singing voice.\n\n(Afterwards I retrieved my old grandma&apos;s crystal ball, rubbed it then gazed into it and saw, Renee Zellweger will win the best actress Oscar for her performance in the 2019 movie &quot;Judy&quot; where she plays Judy Garland and does all her own singing of Garland songs.)\n\nStill, Catherine Z-J has the more powerful, trained voice, having started out on stage, and it is apparent when they are together that Z-J is the more seasoned performer.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised at how well Gere handled his singing duties. Some have complained about his somewhat &quot;nasal&quot; singing voice, but to me it fit his character well. A rich, operatic baritone would have been out of character.\n\nI viewed the DVD with the DTS track selected and it delivers with a fine surround sound. Plus, the picture is very sharp, in all a good DVD to own for fans of musical comedies.\n\nNOV 2024 edit: Watching this movie never gets old."

Expect obvious model miniatures hanging from visible strings, ninjas disappearing into smoke clouds, mixed in real footage of 80s events, made-to-be-bad martial arts scenes, machos with tinted sunglasses in best &quot;Pilot&quot; Heritage, and action scenes straight out of the fake army manual they made for the movie ;) If you take this as a serious try on movie-making, you are in the wrong film.

I thought the love story was cute, for what it was worth, but some of the subplots left me scratching my head. For example, I find it hard to believe that there are a great many red-Becky Jersey boys (and hillbillies, apparently) in the Village who are going to throw beer bottles at gay men who express affection towards one another. I&apos;ve been to the Village before and think the bottle throwers would definitely be bashed back. Not to mention the harassment from the window...omg....is this a lame attempt at humor or seriousness towards the fact that hate still exists? Either way, it felt very out of place.\n\nAnd Adam&apos;s family (ba ha ha--just got that one...!) seemed nothing but a one line lame joke. Did we have to cross over into 3rd rate physical comedy to make some point about a curse? The movie did have its highlights--Parker Posey and Chris Kattan had their moments, the dance off was funny and it did make some interesting points about the human condition and relationships: I liked it when Adam asked Steve what he wanted, and he blurts out: &quot;I don&apos;t know!!&quot; Not an easy thing to admit.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Adam and Steve&quot; has given me a little bit of hope that someone out there might make a gay-themed movie that won&apos;t insult my intelligence.",

Rec and the Orphanage are two examples of great horror&apos;s which makes it all the more disappointing that The Silent House is such a poor film.\n\nThis the story of Laura and her dad , Wilson who are asked to do up an old house but it soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary house and that things are not what they seem.\n\nThe best thing about this film is that it&apos;s only 80 minutes long. I don&apos;t know if i would have got to the end if it was a normal length film. This starts really well . It is suspenseful and has the feel of a Blare Witch type movie. There are very long scenes without breaking away , following the girl around this spooky house but then the film changes. It starts to become confused ( as i was) and far too clever for it&apos;s own good and instead of becoming a good old fashioned haunted house move it changes direction - for the worse. I was annoyed by this film because quite clearly it never had an ending to start with. The director snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory.",

      "reviewBody": "This is Stan Laurel&apos;s show all the way, sure enough Ollie plays his part, but in this double package it&apos;s the genius of Laurel that comes to the fore. The double package in question is the now widely available European release of this film, the first 20 minutes sees the boys making their way to an employment agency where they jump at the chance of a job as maid and butler to the Vandevere family. Yes, this sees Stan dress up as a woman {Agnes} with hilarious results, not only does he buffoon his way thru serving dinner, he gets drunk into the bargain as well !. After being chased off the property by Mr Vandevere, the guys end up road sweeping and whilst taking a break they inadvertently foil a bank robbery and as a reward they get to fulfil their wish of a better education.\n\nThis sends the guys to England and a place at Oxford, the fun starts straight away as they are dressed for Eton !, upon seeing that these two are candidates for pranks being played on them, some of their fellow students send them into a big maze on the bluff that it&apos;s the way to the Deans office. This sets us up for a number of great sequences, most notably a brilliant set of events that sees Stan with three hands, from here we see the boys set up {as a prank} in the Deans own quarters and this of course causes much mirth when the Dean shows up to find the guys boozing away in his bedroom. Roll onto Stan banging his head and suddenly being transformed into an aristocrat called Lord Paddington and you just know that Laurel is getting a pure mania role to get his teeth into, the results are excellent, especially as Stan gets to boss Ollie around.\n\nOne of the best films the boys ever did in my honest opinion, 9/10.",

Assailed from without by a deeply socialist-phobic Europe and from within by intellectual snobbery and a rigid attachment to Marxist dogma (certain aspects of it, at any rate), the Bolsheviks blew it. Eventually they switched gears, but not soon enough to truly salvage their credibility as revolutionaries; their first priority had been to maintain power, and today they are remembered not for shaking the world in 1917 but for the appalling decisions they made afterward. For some reason the atrocities committed by Nicholas II are no longer touched upon, as if everyone had tacitly agreed that they were irrelevant to the discussion. &quot;Tsar to Lenin&quot; demonstrates otherwise, and therein lies its importance. This *was* a necessary and fully justified revolution, and in an age when the working class faces oppression on an almost infinitely greater scale, Lenin&apos;s example should be a source of hope for those of us who believe that things can--and must--change. Just be sure that you understand what took place before and after this crucial moment in history.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak/With most miraculous organ.&quot; Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet\n\nMurders are messy on the screen and in real life; screenplays about them can be chaotic and disjointed also. Such is the case with Black Dahlia, a film noir from Brian De Palma, a past master of the macabre and the complicated (Blow Out, Body Double). It has all the trappings of a first-rate detective novel (James Ellroy) made into a 1940&apos;s thriller with appropriately moody music of the soulful trumpet (Mark Isham), lush production design (Dante Ferretti), and equally impressive costuming (Jenny Beavan), all set in a timelessly seedy Los Angeles.\n\nThere&apos;s also the conflicted, sometimes dark hero detective (Josh Hartnett) and the sexy, dangerous femme fatale (Hilary Swank), accompanied by the questionably good voluptuary sex bomb (Scarlett Johansson). As if these noir troublemakers were not enough, writer Josh Friedman seemingly adapts Ellroy&apos;s every subplot, every story thread, as if each had to be accounted for in the best CSI tradition. \n\nThe original novel was based on aspiring actress Elizabeth Short&apos;s unsolved grizzly murder in 1947. After a considerably convoluted exposition, with plot lines rarely intersecting in a unified way, the film has the nerve to offer one of the most extensive denouements in film history, could be a half hour, with lengthy explanation of how all those ends tied together. Needless to say, anti climaxes abound in this last segment, leaving not only more confusion about the plot but also a desire to get back to The Big Sleep without sleeping, a state Black Dahlia threatened several times.\n\nHartnett&apos;s detective says, &quot;Nothing stays buried forever. Nothing.&quot; I say this weak noir wannabe should stay buried until a bright 22nd century scholar sees its cultural and aesthetic significance. Until then, it&apos;s a jumble of plot points resolved in the end by tedious narration. Even Scarlett Johansson&apos;s pulchritude couldn&apos;t win me, and that&apos;s murder in the first degree."

      "reviewBody": "This is a strange film,not in a weird art-house kind of way, not a psychedelic kind of weird where strangeness is used to show how clever the film-maker is, but the kind of weird that sets the Coen Brothers apart from the usual Hollywood pack. The film centres on the life of Czech folksinger Jaromír Nohavicareal and his struggle of to give up drinking. Having been exiled from his homeland by the communist government for his dissident songs, his return to what was then Czechoslovakia was that of a people&apos;s hero. That he is utterly unknown outside the former eastern block countries is a little disconcerting for western viewers, but Slovak friends assure me it would be like seeing Johnny Cash, or Willie Nelson in the title role. In the east, his alcoholism and triumph over it were all well documented in the media, so the films initial start concentrating on his rehabilitation and the videoing of his therapy seems all too plausible as a genuine documentary.\n\nAs Jaromir continues his recovery, his guitarist and friend Karel Phiral becomes increasingly jealous of the support and friendship he&apos;s found in the detox asylum. Having been refused entry because he wasn&apos;t in need of any help, Karel begins to retreat further and further away from society. Worried about his friends mental health, Jaromir enlists the help of a Czech folk band to stage a fake funeral and jolt his friend out of his depression. This unlikely meeting of musicians ends up producing a rock and folk fusion band that tours Czechoslovakia.\n\nA little strange you might say but not all that weird, what&apos;s strange is the tour did happen, Jaromir did stage a funeral for his friend and the folk band were indeed courted by punk legend and composer for the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra - Jaz Coleman. However, the events in the film now subtly diverge from reality in such a way as to make this a truly magical and outstanding film. The open documentary style means you never have to suspend your disbelief, or question the increasingly odd occurrences that surround the band. The fact that all the musicians play themselves, and that there&apos;s no &quot;acting&quot; only adds to the film&apos;s charm and ability to delight.",

      "reviewBody": "This ¨Sinbad the sailor¨ (1947) displays an all-star-cast formed by Douglas Fairbanks Jr , Maureen O&apos;Hara and Anthony Quinn , among others . Riveting and swashbuckling film with amazing adventures in which Sinbad searches for a valuable treasure located in the Sea of Oman , the course followed by Alexander the Great . The picture talks about the hero Sinbad and his extraordinary and surprising adventures ; being based on loose recounting of ¨The 1.001 Arabian Nights¨ tale . O Masters , o noble persons , o brothers , know you that in the time of the caliph Harum-Al-Rassihd , there lived on the golden shore or Persia a man of adventure called Sinbad . Strange and wondrous were the tales told of him on his voyages . But who, shall we surmise gave him immortality ? . Who , more than all other songs of Allah , spread glory to the name of Sinbad? Who else , o brother but . And now , know ye , all believers of the world of Sinbad , that light voyage , this is the end . This imaginative flick based on ancient legends , deals with Sinbad The Sailor (Douglas Fairbanks) who travels until an island called Deryabar to discover a fantastic treasure of Alexander the Great . Simbad sets off in search for the magnificent treasure and aboard a ship along with a motley crew (Walter Slezak , George Tobias , Mike Mazurki) , but he evil Amir (Anthony Quinn) wants the treasure for himself to own the world. They will have to face off several dangers , villains and henchmen .\n\nIn the movie there are mythology , emotions , adventures , fantasy , swashbuckling and it&apos;s pretty bemusing . It is an exciting fantasy-adventure and pretty amusing . Self-mocking and hamhanded , but some brief moment boring for its confusion . Don&apos;t see this one for the script , which almost doesn&apos;t exist ; otherwise mildly fun . Douglas Fairbanks Jr fits perfectly in his eminent daddy&apos;s swashbuckling shoes . Support cast is frankly good such as Walter Slezak , George Tobias , Jane Greer , Mike Mazurki , among them .The runtime is adequate with various incidents and sub-plots . Director Richard Wallace works his magic around a well-developed screenplay and engaging acting by the entire performers . The confrontation amongst the protagonist and enemies is mesmerizing and fascinating , plenty of leaps and bounds in which Sinbad runs , hits , fights and smiles . Cinematography by George Barnes is colorful , brilliant and shining . classic music composer Roy Webb creates a magnificent and astounding score . The motion picture was rightly directed by Richard Wallace , though confusing and sometimes dull . It&apos;s all in fun , and it is fun . The film obtained much success and achieved enough Box Office . The yarn will appeal to fantasy and fancy imagination buffs , well catching .\n\nOther pictures about the great hero Simbad are the followings : ¨Harryhausen&apos;s Sinbad trilogy¨ , all of them full of special effects with great monsters and breathtaking scale models that are made by the Dynamation system and stop-motion created by means of stop-motion technique by the magician Ray Harryhausen , Ray can once again claim credit for the unusual and marvelous mythical creatures springing to life , as : ¨The 7th voyage of Simbad¨ , directed Nathan Juran with Kerwin Matthews and Kathryn Grant ¨ , ¨Simbad and the eye of tiger¨ directed Sam Wanamaker with Patrick Wayne and Jane Seymour , ¨The Golden voyage of Sinbad¨ by Gordon Hessler with John Philip Law , Caroline Munro and Tom Baker . Furthermore , an Italian muscle epic titled ¨Sinbad of the seven seas¨ by Enzo G Castellari with Lou Ferrigno , Alexandra Martines and John Steiner . In addition , Hollywood cartoon movie ¨Simbad the legend of seven seas¨ (2003) produced by Dreamworks , a combo of computer generator and hand-drawn animation by Patrick Gilmore and Tim Johnson with voices from Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta Jones .",

      "reviewBody": "We are introduced to Wozzeck as he is shaving his superior officer. We can see him drifting off, the knife somewhat out of place, his reaction to the officer&apos;s words, the knife straightening, slowly gliding in a straighter and straighter position, playing with the skin, ready to slice his throat at any given moment. This scene sends chills down your spine - and sets the mood for the entire film.\n\nWozzeck, directed by the fairly unknown Georg C. Klaren, really represents what is so interesting and special about German cinema just after WW2 - a period of cinematic creativity, with many overlaps with the expressions we saw in the early Weimar era. Wozzeck takes this one step further by adopting a visual atmosphere reminiscent of the silent era, frequently with faded edges, and play with the image itself - and to one specific aim. You can, through the cinematography, feel the descent into madness, and experience the increasingly (well, honestly, consistently) unsettling world of our protagonist.\n\nThe only thing contemporary film I can think of comparing it to is really Hangover Square, but only to the extent that the visuals are a gateway to the madness of our protagonist - the expression here goes in a very different direction, i.e. where Hangover Square bring noir aesthetics to 19th century England, Wozzech takes us into a horror landscape of far more stripped back dimensions. In some ways Wozzeck could genuinely feel like an atmospheric arthouse film from the 80s or 90s - the kind of stripped back nightmarish expression toying with bleak existentialism just wasn&apos;t a staple of 40s cinema - and this makes it even more enjoyable.\n\nThe only downside here is the exposition, i.e. the real opening, showing Wozzeck&apos;s body in a science lad, and a battle of ideas between the dr. who is happy to be able to cut up his new body, and charging an offense against this view of disposable humanity, leading into a charge of freeing the people of oppression - and the premise that Wozzeck was pushed to commit the acts he did by the society he lived in. This is too blunt, too clear and forcefully obvious in steering our mind and connecting it to the issue of class. Luckily this framing plays a minimal role in the film itself, which is simply gorgeous.",

      "reviewBody": "Les petites fugues is a marvellous movie. It&apos;s theme is serious, it&apos;s tone is light. The principal person of the movie is an old farmhand on an isolated farm in Switzerland. He buys himself a moped and along with it freedom (and not only) of movement. At first he enjoys his freedom, but later on he discovers that he cannot handle it very well. Strong points of this movie are : - The acting of Michel Robin - Many scenes are very hilarious, for instance the driving lessons; the party at the motor races etc. - Beautiful camerawork; in one instance even stunning. When the farmhand makes his first trip on his own the camera follows him in &quot;birdsview&quot; and by enlarging the distance the landscape opens up more and more thus symbolising in a convincing way the freedom he has gained. - The movie is very likable. Here in the Netherlands we can receive about 20 channels which broadcast movies. I cannot remember that this movie has been programmed in the last 10 years. I cannot understand why such a nice and accessible movie gets so little attention. It made me wonder if it&apos;s still available; many &quot;Filmencyclopedies&quot; don&apos;t mention it anymore. I&apos;m glad I found it in the IMDB",

Gotz George is a revelation in this role, as he plays mostly rough, real, troubled men. Jokes are painful as well as light-hearted, the musical score is brilliant, and the still present awe for Hitler is prominently presented as well as ridiculed. The drama unfolds in a fast pace, and is over before you know it. I think, the dislikers expected a very much different approach to the theme, e.g. the commentator who promoted the English version of this journalistic farce. I think it is simply not interesting enough to show that Trevor Roper was sorely misled. The whole point of this German movie is that it shows that the whole affair is largely due to the still present enormous awe of the person of Hitler, and that not only in Germany ! The bizarre notion that &quot;history had to be rewritten, with this discovery&quot; is of course nonsense, which was believed by German journalists as well as foreign experts (or should i say &quot;experts&quot; ). For me this movie is a great German achievement!",

      "reviewBody": "Kika is a movie whose plot sounds tasteless beyond belief if merely read aloud. After all it features an extended rape scene played for laughs; the rapist himself is a porn star who has sexually assaulted so many girls that his sister forms an incestuous relationship with him to take his mind off raping even more women. This is hardly typical comic fare it has to be said. Imagine if in 1979 Mel Brooks had decided to make a spoof of I Spit on Your Grave, the results would have been an absolute travesty. That&apos;s what the synopsis of Kika makes you think of. However, Kika was made by Pedro Almodóvar and for some reason he seems to be capable of making even the most grossly offensive material so completely ridiculous it comes at you in reverse and can be alarmingly funny. The rape scene in Kika is comedic and before watching the movie I simply could not understand how such a thing could ever be.\n\nThe film is named after the cosmetologist played by Veronica Forqué. But the movie is not really her story, it has several memorable characters. Ramón is a young photographer whose mother commits suicide. Nicholas is his womanising step-father. The latter hires Kika to work on the corpse of Ramón, who comes back to life unexpectedly and embarks on a relationship with Kika. Kika&apos;s maid Juana is a lesbian who is in love with Kika, her brother Pablo is the porn star rapist. All the time in the background on the television is Andrea (a.k.a. Scarface) the host of a reality TV show that celebrates real life tragedy, death and destruction. The movie concludes with an unexpected serial killer plot strand.\n\nIt&apos;s true that the story is somewhat chaotic. There are so many separate ideas in here that the film seems a bit unfocused. But because it is essentially a comedy this isn&apos;t really so much of a problem. While there is a lot of silly humour, the film is mainly a media satire. With this in mind the most important and memorable character is Andrea who is kitted out in some fantastically over-the-top Jean-Paul Gaultier outfits, including her street gear which includes a helmet with attached movie camera. Victoria Abril is really excellent in this role. She is simultaneously wicked and sexy at all times. The scenes of her broadcasting her show from a stage are the most visually iconic in the movie. She roams the streets of Madrid intrusively filming scenes of grieving people and aftermaths of violent encounters. She is the black heart of Kika.\n\nDespite the controversial moments it&apos;s simply impossible to take the events depicted at all seriously. Almodóvar&apos;s typical colourful aesthetic is present throughout and the tone is consistently absurd. This means that he gets away with material that would have been contentious otherwise. As it is, Kika is very entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "Romeo Must Die is the 1st and in my opinion, the better of the two hip hop/martial arts action films directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. The movie is pretty nicely shot and slick looking and actually is really well performed by the cast. The plot is loosely based off Romeo And Juliet, but don&apos;t expect anything artsy fartsy, this is an action movie with two warring crime families(one Chinese and the other African American). Aalyah is beautiful and gives a fine performance as love interest for Jet Li. Delroy Lindo and Issiah Washington give pretty solid performances as well. Russell Wong is a cool villain and comic relief Anthony Anderson is actually funny. My problem with the movie is the crazy wire fu sequences don&apos;t really work as well here as it would in Jet Li&apos;s movies from Hong Kong. I don&apos;t think Corey Yuen&apos;s fight choreography is bad, it just is out of place and not really suited for this movie. Thankfully DMX only has a cameo here, he was top billed in the other Andrzej Bartkowiak/Jet Li collaboration Cradle 2 The Grave and he was terrible in that movie. Overall, this is a pretty decent action movie that introduced Jet Li to new audiences, but I prefer his work in China/Hong Kong to his action movies made in the United States and Europe.",

      "reviewBody": "A remarkable and excellent film. This movie visualises and exposes the gap between a child&apos;s needs and the state&apos;s ability and/or desire to provide for those needs. West Germany in 1979 is an advanced society that provides many different options for wayward kids to get back onto the path of normalised behaviour. These options are provided by different institutions and thereby lies the problem exposed by this film, that the institutions lack flexibility. It becomes clear that a child&apos;s recovery relies on bespoke processes being put in place, not the child having to fit into one unyielding programme after another. No amount of meetings about what to do with troubled teens like Martin (brilliantly played by Gerhard Gundel) can improve his experience of incarceration in these institutions whilst the bullying and rigidity of the process isn&apos;t tackled. Martin Sonntag is a wayward 14 year old brought up in poverty. School absence and petty crime cause him to end up in several institutions. The inability of those in charge to understand Martin&apos;s needs and the failure of the very few who recognise the problem to be able change anything, lead slowly and inexorably to Martin&apos;s increased internalisation and a tragic conclusion.",

So, we should be thankful that the stars aligned for it to go to Catherine Spaak, perhaps the single most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen. (Here, of course, she&apos;s an adorable teenage girl, whose precocious mannerisms are sure to win audience&apos;s hearts.)\n\nI wont spoil anything; give this a chance. Its a masterful expression of all the ways in which people hurt each other in the process of love, and are bitterly disappointed by life, all wrapped in a deceptively simple premise. All the best movies teach an important lesson of the craft, and I Dolci Inganni is the gold standard example of efficiency: how to say the most with the smallest runtime, pack the most subtext into a straightforward narrative and fully explore the depth of a most simplest theme.",

      "reviewBody": "One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn&apos;t the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.\n\nThe action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.\n\nActing wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren&apos;t taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.\n\nWhile I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn&apos;t have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.\n\nWhy Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don&apos;t know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.",

      "reviewBody": "The common cliché goes that there are two kinds of films: entertainment for the masses on one hand and arthouse cinema on the other. Of course, &quot;consumers&quot; of the former are supposed to find the latter pretentious and boring while &quot;connoisseurs&quot; of the later are expected to sneer upon the former. Oldrich Lipsky, probably not too respectfully, disagrees. Rarely has a filmmaker so successfully blended pure aesthetic, often quite surreal and bordering on oenirism, with unrivaled primal hilarity. This move is a prime example; taking one of the lesser known Jules Verne stories, and expanding on the book&apos;s plot all the while remaining quite faithful to it, he turned it into a retro-futurist steampunk horror comedy that Verne probably wouldn&apos;t recognise as his novel - which doesn&apos;t mean he wouldn&apos;t like it.\n\nOne particularity of this movie that should be noted here is that its creative use of language. The film is full of signs and written notices in the fictional language of the (also fictional) Kingdom of Carpathia. Clearly designed to imitate typical Romanian idioms but still be understandable by Czech viewers (and immediately bring Dracula stories and similar folklore to their minds), it is a wonderfully baroque creation that is to language what the film&apos;s props are to technology. The peasants, meanwhile, speak in another made up (but understandable) dialect that a Czech speaker will invariably find very funny. Indeed, may lines from those dialogues became part of the Czech popular culture. The movie draws a large part of its humour and atmosphere from this and, unfortunately, viewers who don&apos;t understand Czech and rely on subtitles are deprived of an important part of the viewer&apos;s experience.\n\n@rooprect: if you loved this film, don&apos;t miss &quot;Adele didn&apos;t have dinner yet&quot; (Adela jeste nevecerela): same director, same producer, same actors in the two leading roles, same retro-futurism, same &quot;horror&quot; that will make you shake... with uncontrollable laughter.",

      "reviewBody": "Title: Invaders from Mars (1986) \n\nDirector: Tobe Hooper (the man!) \n\nCast: Karen Black, Hunter Carson, James Karen \n\nReview: Tobe Hoopers resume includes many great films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lifeforce, Poltergeist)...and many so-so ones (Spontanious Combustion, The Mangler). Invaders from Mars the re-make of the original alien invasion flick from the 1950&apos;s is one of his good ones. Not great, just good.\n\nEarly on in the film an alien spaceship crashes in David Gardners back yard, slowly but surely everyone in town starts acting weird...soon David must be the one responsible for stopping the aliens from conquering his home town...and maybe the world! This movie is a remake of the 1950 original, and just by the simplicity of the story you can tell that. It has that simple, light hearted, almost innocent feel that the movies had back in those days. But Hooper adds his only brand of weirdness and surrealism to the film that makes it feel like its some sort of nightmare you might have had while falling asleep watching midnight alien invasion films on your TV. Its the type of movie in which people start acting not quite themselves and you get that &quot; something is wrong here&quot; vibe going on, not unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nThe aliens look great thanks to Stan Winstons always excellent work. But I must admit they do seem kind of harmless. They don&apos;t seem like they could be a threat. I mean yeah they got huge gaping mouths with rows upon rows of teeth...but they feel dumb and stupid. For example they have these big ass laser guns attached to their noggins...but they get overtaken by the us army in the blink of an eye? Still, they look cool. Specially their leader who looks like a huge giant brain that comes out of a slimy worm-whole type of thing. If you ask me he also looks pretty harmless....but who cares! They are supposed to be evil! And they are trying to take over earth! Kill them! The sets are awesome, the interior of the the ship is great looking, it kind of has an organic look and feel to it. But it always beats the hell out of me why aliens from mars would have disco lights inside of their ship. You kind of get the feeling that at any moment an alien DJ is going to pop up and spin a couple of cool tunes on his two turn tables and a microphone. Anyhows, the over all effect looked cool so I ain&apos;t complaining.\n\nObviously production values ain&apos;t the real problem with this flick. Its sets and creatures are awesome looking.\n\nThe acting is what hurts this film a bit. Karen Black and the Kid just didn&apos;t do it for me in certain scenes. The kid sucked as an actor which explains why we probably haven&apos;t seen much of him in any other movie. His dialog was to robotic. Like he just read it and blurted it out without any actual thought or preparation as to what he was supposed to be going through in the scene. Sorry dude, but facts are facts. The only actors worth mentioning are the evil teacher and James Karen as General Wilson kicking alien ass all over the place.\n\nInvaders from Mars is the type of film you want to show your little kid brother or cousin or son if you want to start him into horror. It goes in my collection right along side other great kid friendly horror films as The Monster Squad and The Gate. Give it a shot.\n\nRating: 31/2 out of 5",

      "reviewBody": "Fans of the brilliant &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos; will no doubt be curious to check out the first movie by its director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie. While no where near as assured as that movie or McQuarrie&apos;s subsequent underrated directorial debut &apos;The Way Of The Gun&apos;, it has enough going for it to make it worth tracking down. Ron Marquette&apos;s impressive performance as the enigmatic Whiley Pritcher is by far the best thing about the movie. He displays plenty of charisma and acting chops which makes his suicide a couple of years after the release of &apos;Public Access&apos; all the more tragic. Pritcher is a stranger who moves into Brewster, a seemingly average small town and begins broadcasting a show on a local public access TV station. His probing into the dark side of Brewster causes a lot of debate and some hostility, especially when he aligns himself with the town&apos;s Mayor. So far, so good. The first half of the movie is very well done and makes fascinating viewing. After that, while the mood turns darker and more violent, it also gets increasingly less compelling, and to me ultimately very anti-climactic. Marquette is good throughout but can&apos;t salvage the uneven script which doesn&apos;t seem to explore the interesting premise enough to make this one anything special. The frequent comparisons to David Lynch circa &apos;Blue Velvet&apos; are not entirely off-base, but unfortunately &apos;Public Access&apos; flounders way before it finishes. Nice try though, and still worth viewing."

Three families from 3 different religions, backgrounds and nationalities become neighbors. Not very thrilled with the idea of associating with each other at the beginning, shortly soon life and war bring these people together. The movie is about humanity and kindness. It&apos;s about having hope and seeing light even in the darkest of times. It will most likely leave you in tears, but you will not regret spending time watching in. Ukraine just keeps on surprising with how talented they are in everything!",

It was based on a book that the author, Dorothy Baker, admitted was &quot;inspired&quot; by the life of Bix and his music. Most professional jazz musicians and Bix contemporaries find much of it, especially the search for &quot;high notes,&quot; laughable, and an inaccurate portrayal of any musician&apos;s life, let alone Bix&apos;s. Many of those same people find the film even more flawed...\n\nHowever, that said, this is good Hollywood. Classic Curtiz work with many of the same nuances you&apos;ll find in Casablanca (you&apos;ll enjoy the use of smoke and shadow in the b/w environment). It was a film that many of the leads reportedly did not enjoy making (subject matter hit a little too close to home for Hoagy Carmichael and Doris Day), but that does not seem to seep into the film too much. Lauren Bacall satisfyingly fills the role of the sultry wrong woman, Day is terribly wholesome but alluring, and any chance to see Hoagy on screen is worth the price of a rental. Now, if only the Kirk Douglasness of Kirk Douglas could have been turned down a hair..."

The Swiss Alps are just majestic and beautiful, and even though the film is in black and white the beauty of the Alps is undeniable. the story is a classic filled with love,passion,drama,and humor.

It was great seeing the Superman cast back together again, including Gene Hackman who we haven&apos;t seen since Superman II. This time, Alexander and Ilya Salkind were not producing the movie. Instead, Menaham Golan and Yoram Globus, the owners of Cannon films, were producing. If you ask me, the Salkinds knew how to make a Superman movie better than those two. \n\nIn Superman IV, Superman hears the threat of Nuclear War over and over, and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man. At the same time, Lex Luthor has broken out of jail again and this time, his sidekick is his dorky nephew Lenny. The two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating Nuclear Man. Nuclear Man has the same powers as Superman but, the only difference is that Nuclear Man gets his power from the sun.\n\n While all of this is going on, The Dailey Planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on Clark Kent.\n\n So Superman has a big job here: SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!\n\nI&apos;m going to say that, anyone who has seen the first three Superman films, then just go ahead and see IV because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series. But, in my opinion, I didn&apos;t like it much. I think Alexander &amp; Ilya Salkind would&apos;ve made a hell of a last movie.",

It is actually like a documentary of a fictious character (or who knows he didn&apos;t exist) living in a socialist Poland who is being commissioned to conduct a new chemical factory. The movie shows quite realistic portrait of a man who tries to keep his values in order in the middle of all corruption and chaos of different social movements of the time. The movie doesn&apos;t go into any character&apos;s side actually, but tries to display the difficulties of the system and how an individual is powerless in many ways.\n\nThe storytelling is very slow and at times a bit jumpy. The music scenes of the movie, that are very rare, are quite bizarre, almost eerie.\n\nI cannot recommend the movie to anyone who tend to fall asleep in slow dramas, but those who like other Kieslowsky films or documentaries of socialism, this is an interesting flick.",

Something about a rifle and him getting tired of switching it around, &quot;there&apos;s no target on earth, and no purpose in heaven.&quot; Very well done. As for the Bush commentary, I think the movie hints that George Bush is not a complex man, just like Billy the Kid wasn&apos;t a very complex man either. And why would you assume that only people who understand Bush&apos;s supposed &quot;complexity&quot; are the ones who watch this movie. It was made by the French for heaven&apos;s sake, most of whom likely despise Bush at this point. The melancholy telling of end of an era, along with a parallel side story of present day happenings in the same location reveals much about the character and vitality of the West and its people.",

Bearing in mind it&apos;s DTV it would be unfair to compare it to the likes of Under Siege and Exit Wounds but its definitely one his better efforts from the last ten or so years. Lots of action in this one and well done to for the quality of the gun fights. Seagal packs in quite a few brutal fist fights too. The story although perhaps a little bit more complicated than it needed to be moves along at a good pace. Byron Mann who teamed up with Seagal previously in Belly of the Beast and also appeared in Sniper 3 with Tom Berenger makes a good bad guy but he is perhaps a little underused. Recommended for Seagal fans.",

This movie is a very realistic account of the life that is lead by many of those close to me.\n\nBanning this movie does kids a favor, it doesn&apos;t let our parents see the ridiculous lives we lead.  All of us kids should see this movie so we can all question our actions and realize the hole we&apos;ve dug ourselves.  But parents should be protected from seeing such films as &quot;Kids&quot; and &quot;Ken Park&quot;.  These are the realities we try so hard to keep from our parents, why would we want to let larry clark show them?\n\nI was unaffected by this movie, impressed at the reality it captured, but unaffected by the actions in which the kids partook, except Tate&apos;s ordeal, although I know kids like that, I generaly don&apos;t associate with them, and that made his part of the movie very difficult to handle.\n\nLarry Clark scares me.  I just hope my parents don&apos;t get a hold of this movie, or &quot;KIDS&quot;.  He has done a terrific job of grabbing the reality of our lives, and I would hope he keeps making these amazingly realistic movies, as long as my parents don&apos;t see them."

Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry reunite as the retired Mafia Hit-man and the nervy dentist, as does Amanda Peet as the aspiring hit woman. The thing is this time around the acting wasn&apos;t that great. Willis is usually good with comic timing but it isn&apos;t there here, while Peet looks bored. Only Perry really stands out, his slapstick schtick makes me want to watch an episode of Friends pretty much.\n\nThe film is stylishly shot, and has a good soundtrack, and there is evidence of some solid pacing. However, the plot is very contrived, the direction haphazard and the script weak. So overall, this film was a disappointment, it wasn&apos;t completely awful but I would be lying if I said it was great. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

Of corse Ironside is just a low rent Jack Nicholson.  I guess Mike was busy that year with &quot;Highlander 2: The Quickening&quot;.  Sadly &quot;Beastmaster 2&quot; would have been a much better career move.  It is certainly the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;.  Not only does it star the incomparable Mark Singer it also features an amazing supporting cast, specifically the second girl from &quot;Sliders&quot;, Uncle Phil from &quot;Fresh Prince of Belair&quot; and evil chick from &quot;Superman 2&quot;.  It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  BEASTMASTER FOREVER!!! ROCK&apos;N ROLL!!!",

Thats why dare to say that he has better movies in his dossier. This includes also Sole a Cattinelle. The movie we are speaking now has a very weak female character - all I remembered the day after was her teeth. SO she just smiled and made grimaces. And did it for unforgivable too many minutes of the film. The Checco itself plays good and his character is more consistent and vivid so thats fine. The first half of the movie is rather interesting but then...you need some 1 liter or beer to keep being interested because rather weird scenes and events without sense takes place. And then you await the last 10 minutes waiting of something extraordinary to make for the annoying half an hour. But...oh no, the thing in the end with the building is just stupid. Why the woman did so I cant get. Because it has NO sense. Per fortuna, we have better and more interesting Checco films. Dixi",

The three main persons of the action were greatly filled: The cool Katja Riemann as pharmacist, which is rather innocently entangled into the events, Jürgen Vogel as a somewhat eccentric and sometimes calculating medical student Levin and Richy Müller as convict and its friend lets arise at no time boredom. The film is characterised not only by interesting characters, but also by its great black humor. Result: A genuine pleasure.",

The word Monster in the title is a bit deceiving as most of the creatures are the sea form of dinosaurs. The 3 D experience is absolutely outstanding. I found that sitting toward the front of the theater produced the best 3 D experience. This movie may be a little intense for small children but all other ages will love it. The one positive thing for children is the forty minute run times that seems to fly by. National Geographic should have a hit on their hands as more and more people travel back in time to check out the Sea Monsters.",

If there&apos;s any &quot;justice&quot; in Hollywood, this one should be Oscar bait for at least cinematography, costuming, musical score and the magnum-magnificent presence of some dude I never heard of before I saw AATK -- Chow Yun Fat.  Now, I have been informed that he is the Coolest Actor in the World (according to L.A. Times).  I can see this dark, cool elegance in his breathtaking performance as a real and fascinating historic figure, King Mongkut, who in actuality learned Latin, astronomy and memorized major parts of both Bible and Koran while a Buddhist monk.  Contrary to the buffoonery of Yul Brynner&apos;s overblown portrayal, Chow opens for us an entirely new cultural door, brushing for the eager audience a portrait of a monarch of absolutely power who wields it so well that he is unafraid of gentleness, hugging his enchanting, on-screen children without reserve and finding himself mystifyingly in love with a foreign woman he cannot tame or bed because of the constraint of the times. The betrayal, revolution and barbarity of l9th century Thailand (Siam) become pale watercolor in comparison to the bold red and orange of unresolved love and religious and cultural interplay represented by Foster and Chow. We fear that more of these mesmerizing moments between the two lie on the editing room floor.  However, Chow&apos;s sensitive face and body language reflect this inner evolution and bittersweet turmoil far better than does Jodie Foster&apos;s rather wooden performance accompanied by a troubling British accent. I respect Foster&apos;s talent immensely, though it shone through only intermittently, blossoming only when she softens to the King&apos;s patient (sometimes stormy) friendship.  The indelible etching of the film comes during a non-speaking sequence involving the disposition of Tuptim and Balat which sub-plot likely was originally meant to be a subtle reflection of the untenable love affair between Anna and Mongkut. This is so well-edited and scored that it&apos;s going to be hard to forget. When the King kneels in agonized prayer before his talismanic Emerald Buddha, one is compelled to conclude that he is in anguish -- not only over what&apos;s happening to his concubine and his throne -- but the fact that his actions necessitated by politics will also probably forever separate him from his tea-tray-tossing Anna and all she believes in and has worked for in his country.  Okay, so I cried in several places (something I nearly never do) -- the mark of a film which has accomplished its goal, i.e., the moving of hearts. I was fascinated with this movie. It made me read and research a part of the world I&apos;ve generally ignored, and whole new palace gates have opened. Sumptuous and rich it is; and award-winning it should be, but the sun-star opulence of this new guy, Chow, is the stellar pin on that film curtain. Thanks, Mr. Tennant. And thank you, Mr. Chow."

      "reviewBody": "Accidents Happen – Sydney Film Festival, June 2009 I was sold on this film by a description of Geena Davis who &quot;shines as the screwball mother&quot;. The SFF program seemed to promise a screwball family comedy, with Davis&apos; fearlessness in performance carrying the required bravado. So I was surprised when the opening sequence, a slow-motion shot of a playing child interrupted by an elderly neighbour accidentally barbecuing himself, suggested another tone was in the offing: a coming-of-age black comedy. That combination works well here.\n\nTo labour the labeling a little, ladling on a portmanteau, ACCIDENTS HAPPEN is a &apos;dramedy&apos;. It&apos;s a realistic story of an early 80s suburban family unit fractured by an auto accident. The emotional weight of their tragedy squeezes absurdity out of the cracks in their stasis. Gloria Conway (Davis) turns her rapid-fire wit to lashing her &apos;useless&apos; ex-husband but that is clearly a losing game for her as she is not much more on top of her grief for their lost children than he is.\n\nThe relationship between surviving but bereft younger son Billy and his ballsy mother is the meat of the film. They present a remarkably compelling take on an interdependent relationship. They made me really care that they would work it out, and a refreshing change from the common film stereotype of merely alienated teens.\n\nThe film overall is a showcase of great characterization through screen writing and performances, not just from the poised teen-aged leads but also minor characters like the barbecue-induced widow Mrs Smolensky. She steps startlingly out of being a background character in the payoff scene at the film&apos;s end.\n\nThat final sequence also left me backpedaling on conclusions I leapt to earlier about the film&apos;s symbolism. Up until that point, the crucial role of a bowling ball in the plot lent itself to symbolism of emotional baggage, a crushing burden to carry and destructively out of control when neglected. That ball&apos;s ultimate destination revealed over the end-credits indicates the authors either didn&apos;t have that in mind, or were pointing us to some other significance entirely. Comments here suggesting what that significance might be are very welcome.\n\nOriginally posted at http://moviebookchats.posterous.com/movie-review-accidents-happen",

      "reviewBody": "Most successful Australian films are quintessentially Australian. From Walkabout in 1970 via Peter Weir&apos;s pictures such as Picnic at Hanging Rock; The Last Wave and Gallipoli, right up to releases around Lantana such as The Tracker; Dirty Deeds; Rabbit-Proof Fence; Aussie Rules; The Dish and the Steve Irwin vehicle, The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course. Their appeal is partly based on an exploration of Australian culture or rather a contrast of cultures either within Australia or with the rest of the world. Like much of British Cinema, Australian Cinema has taken refuge in nationhood.\n\nLantana is different. Although it is set in present day Sydney it could, with the exception of the film&apos;s metaphorical title, be set in any Western urban conurbation. The film does not depend on either supposed Aussie character traits or well-known locations. Postcard Sydney is eschewed in favour of suburbia and mid-town. It is also bold as, although it contains a crime detection story, the film is primarily about an interwoven set of relationships gone wrong. The police investigation does not begin until halfway through the film, and this allows the relationships to be explored in detail before the more conventional narrative begins. \n\nLeon (Anthony LaPaglia) is a morose police detective whose marriage to Sonja (the excellent Kerry Armstrong) is failing. His brief affair with Jane (Rachael Blake) in the opening sequence, is a symptom not a cause. Sonja confides her worries of the affair to Dr. Somers (Barbara Hershey), whose own relationship is soured by suspicion and tragedy. The only solid relationship is that of Jane&apos;s neighbours, whose domestic circumstances are the most difficult. This background unfolds in the first half of the film and the individual relationships are then laid over the plot allowing both an intertwining and explanation. The strength of the film is that as the characters have already been well realised, so their actions and emotions can be understood in the second half of the film. This is territory often reserved to a good novel, and is rarely brought off in the cinema and it is so well done here that a couple of narrative co-incidences can be forgiven.\n\nThe lantana is a large native Australian flowering plant, whose attractive and benign appearance conceals a thorny interior. The shrub is cleverly threaded into the plot and serves as a reminder that in relationships, things might not be all they seem and that care is needed to prevent hurt. In keeping with the film&apos;s realistic style there are no feel-good resolutions but the emotional intensity carries it to an ending of some hope rather than desolation.",

      "reviewBody": "2 men who were sentenced to death by their doctors spent their precious remaining time together to experience something they never had chance to do before when they occasionally found a lot of money two stupid gangsters left.\n\nThis is a crazy comedy with good entertainment, and because we know the tragical end, so the highly contrast of the hilarious story really make me have a bittersweet feeling which is wonderful.\n\nTheir last wish is to see sea with their own eyes, a quite common wish but they never did before. We always think we have a lot of time to do things we want to do, but nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. We never have the courage to do something derailed from our normal track of life, and gradually lost the aim and fun of it, living numbly and waiting to the final destination.\n\nThe cast is good and I Love Til Schweiger so much, really a charming role! Moritz Bleibtreu is outstanding as one of the moron gangster too.\n\nI rarely watch Germany comedic films, &quot;Knockin&apos; On Heaven&apos;s Door&quot; is an exception even it might be too crazy for some people, still need a good recommendation.",

There is also a lovely scene with the &quot;comrade princess&quot; Natasha Romanova(the gorgeous Daliah Lavi who left us in 2017) in the Kremlin. OK, I won&apos;t tell you the whole movie, how many others do, it&apos;s great fun, watch it, I recommend it with confidence!

A very good actor who just melts your heart in his characterizations.\n\nBurt Lancaster as the Agent trying to solve an old case that has bugged the Secret Service for a decade; and Dorothy McGuire as the U.N. interpreter caught up in the investigation are fine. When they are in the restaurant purring at each other, while saying serious things about the case, it is a wonderful scene. Fine direction and acting.\n\nI watch it as the beginning of my holiday &quot;classic&quot; film month. Nothing to do with Christmas, Thanksgiving or New Years. But it does end with the music to Auld Lang Sang playing in the background and the spirit is that of a holiday movie. A treat and I give it 9/10.\n\nJane",

      "reviewBody": "Famed Broadway producer George White appeared in a second film version of his famous scandals the year after the first one. The original screen George White&apos;s Scandals introduced Alice Faye to the screen and Faye is once again featured. White appears as himself again and this time does a little hoofing in a dance contest.\n\nThe plot is again a backstage romance story on wish to display various numbers you would have seen on Broadway in the Scandals revue. It involves Alice Faye and James Dunn, a vaudeville team appearing in a small town show that&apos;s also in another White show, this one though involving small town producer Elmer White played by that merriest of screen actors, Ned Sparks.\n\nWhite&apos;s passing through town and discovers that the show is really a gold mine of talent. He signs Dunn, Faye, Cliff Edwards, Lyda Roberti and even Sparks himself for his new George White&apos;s 1935 Scandals.\n\nOf course both Dunn and Faye let stardom go to their heads a little, but you know it all works out in the end.\n\nEleanor Powell got her first big break after a couple of bit roles in two previous films. But this didn&apos;t lead to a Fox contract, Louis B. Mayer snapped her up right away.\n\nLike the previous film, George White&apos;s 1935 Scandals is a nice historic record of a Broadway review. One only wishes Florenz Ziegfeld had lived long enough to create a film version of the Follies himself. But this pales in comparison with what Busby Berkeley was achieving over at Warner Brothers in this decade. \n\nWhite might have considered hiring Berkeley, but then his personal imprimatur wouldn&apos;t have been on the picture. After all he wasn&apos;t producing the Busby Berkeley scandals.\n\nStill it&apos;s a pleasant enough musical review and the plot doesn&apos;t get too much in the way.",

The photography in this flick really captures parts of London that are rarely seen on film. The underground. The rave at the beginning. The market seen where christian is collecting his wages are so familiar. Keitel again was very good. I especially liked the way he acted around the London police - cool, calm with lack of visual emotion. I guess that at present TYA is quite ironic in some ways as london police are using NY methods to battle crime.\n\n I liked this film alot, and would give it an eight out of ten based on photography, soundtrack and a cool storyline,"

He pretty much owns the local Arizona community of Forge River lock, stock, and barrel, including weakling lawman John Mayfield (Phil Brown, &quot;Star Wars&quot;). He has a seething hatred for the local Apaches, and goes about ensuring that the people will eventually want to go to war with them.\n\nJust for one example of how rotten Vicente is, there&apos;s a tragedy in the brothers&apos; past, and Pablo is not completely convinced that it was an &quot;accident&quot;. You can tell that Telly is relishing his role; while he stops short of real scenery-chewing, you just KNOW that he&apos;s having fun. In essence, his despicable heel is what makes the film truly worth watching.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s nothing great, but it&apos;s an entertaining story capably told, by filmmaker Nathan H. Juran, in a rare Western assignment for the director; he was better known as a director of fantasy (ex. &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;) and sci-fi (ex. &quot;The Brain from Planet Arous&quot;) pictures. Although peppered with obvious stock footage, its action scenes ARE well-done. It&apos;s also got a good supporting cast: Arlene Dahl (&quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;), Janet Landgard (&quot;The Swimmer&quot;), Guy Rolfe (&quot;The Stranglers of Bombay&quot;), George Coulouris (&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), Jocelyn Lane (&quot;Tickle Me&quot;), Fernando Rey (&quot;The French Connection&quot;), and Robert Carricart (&quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;).\n\nFairly violent without ever being TOO gory, this does get a pretty big boost from the score by Bruno Nicolai, and from its location shooting in Spain (which leads some people to mistakenly assume it&apos;s a Euro-Western, when in fact it was an American production).\n\nSeven out of 10.",

The audience at the Film Forum in New York sat in awed silence while the music washed though us and the lyrics cleansed our souls. Sometimes, the words cut painfully close to the bone, reminding us of our shared experience of being human.\n\nLeonard Cohen goes to places most of us are unwilling to look at and brings back truth that no one can deny. Bono accurately describes it as going into the abyss and laughing at it. The artists performing his songs follow him there and brilliantly express the depth of his poetry set to music.\n\nThis is an outstanding film, documenting the poetic voice of our generation, and surely of many generations to come.",

Who could resist the lushness of the Malay jungle juxtaposed with the British Governor&apos;s pristine lawns? Not to mention the fascinating interweaving of the old love triangle amongst Ferris, Dhana, and Ng with an anti-colonial rebellion? I may have been a precocious child, but these things were clear to me amidst the Vietnam War. It&apos;s good to see others who recall this movie for what it remains--a trenchant comment on nationalist insurgents fighting their imperialist overlords. The irony is that, despite the purity of their intentions, the guerrillas destroy what they fight for: control of their own destiny. One might read the lovely Dhana as the fragile Malayan countryside laid waste in the ensuing skirmishes. True enough that the British colonial government executes Dhana. Yet both Ferris and Ng lose their dreams as well: Ferris leaves Malaya without Dhana (or even Candace), and Ng is dead.\n\nWhen I found the LP recording of the beautiful Riz Ortolani score about 20 years ago, I snatched it up. I won&apos;t expect a CD version, but Ortolani deserves to be lauded for music that supports the storyline. We may well remember &quot;More&quot; from Mondo Cane, but the haunting theme from The 7th Dawn can hold its own.\n\nNow, if only one could include this movie in a grouping of films with the broad theme of protesting war (Live for Life, Year of Living Dangerously, Torn Apart, Indochine)and show them to politicians...."

One of his best to one of his worst.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Harry Fabian is a fast-talking lawyer. He sues and settles, looking to make it big as he carries on an affair with the wife of the owner of his local hang out. While losing a case to a local mobster who fronts as a sports promoter, Fabian senses his future as a boxing promoter. For protection from the mobster, he recruits the boss&apos;s older brother as his &quot;judge of talent&quot; he books a hall, he orders posters. Soon he&apos;s in debt waiting for the big night to rake in the cash. His sweetheart wants to leave her husband, so she needs Fabian&apos;s help to get a liquor license to set up her own bar. All the while the mobster is still making trouble.\n\nJessica Lange and Jack Warden are the best actors on display here, even if you never understand Lange&apos;s characters loyalty to Fabian even after he ruined her dream. As for De Niro he seems to be trying far too hard, maybe it was poor directing?? And his acting in the Alley at the end is woeful. \n\nThe only reason I&apos;m glad I watched this to the end was the fact that I got to hear Freddie Mercury sing &apos;The Great Pretender&apos; over the closing credits which was a nice surprise.",

I originally thought it was a sea creature story like Jaws.\n\n I was thrilled to watch it this morning and discover that it is that rare breed of a film:  so much is wrong like bad dialog &amp; unlikely situations, bad acting from every single extra in the film (casting call at the community college everybody!!), kid turns WAY too quickly against dad but dad is probably the most incompetent dad you&apos;ll see (hey, this is much better than Disneyland...hired the worst pilot on the face of the planet because you&apos;re too cheap to pay for a boat and now held captive in a 3rd world nation.  Thanks dad!), cheezy violence, that music that plays during the violent ship attacks would work for Errol Flynn but not here.\n\n But it&apos;s films of this badness that can be more fun than so-called great films.  Especially the first time you watch them.  I&apos;m the type that seeks out films like Bad Taste, Hysterical, Evil Dead and The Island because they go against the copycat stream of Hollywood films.\n\nNOTE:  I would&apos;ve spanked that kid within an inch of his life and I don&apos;t even believe in physical punishment of children.  I think we all agree here! LOL"

She dances a lot and strips at any opportunity.\n\nShe&apos;s rescued from muggers by an older man, Robert, who becomes her boyfriend. Being a free spirit, she also makes it with a male stripper and a politician. When her roommate Susan gets hooked on pills and becomes a prostitute before ending up in the hospital, Terry helps her get back on track.\n\nAfter getting the lead in a &quot;Chorus Line&quot;-type dance show, Terry leaves her boyfriend and is ready to make it on her own.\n\nThe film attempts to be about Terry&apos;s search for her identity, although the character and the actress are too vapid to be interesting. With its many scenes of Terry bicycling and doing leg-lifts, this film is like a racier version of FLASHDANCE. D&apos;Amato&apos;s sidekick Laura Gemser is not in it, but there is a Gemser-lookalike who gives Terry a massage.\n\nIt&apos;s probably D&apos;Amato&apos;s most benign, bubble-headed film. A sequel, DIRTY LOVE 2, did not feature Demy, who went on to star in the VALENTINA series of sexy romps.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s interesting to me that this film is viewed as offensive. People say that these people are being made fun of and exploited. I wouldn&apos;t like to comment on how they were treat on set or anything but I will say that they all see to enjoying them selfs for the most part and as for being made fun of, I think the total opposite is happening.\n\nThis movie came out in 1932 so before I watched it I also was nervous that these people would be used to make others laugh at their expense but it was the furthest thing from the truth. This film hands its subject matter with such care and deft that I was astounded that it came out in 1932.\n\nIt can be like looking at window into the past as sometimes it almost plays like a documentary due to the fact that most of these actors were actually circus performers. There are so many scenes where the performers are just relaxing and chatting to each other. It shows people they are just like us, it doesn&apos;t mater if they look different. It shows them doing mundane things like hanging washing, struggling with problems like infidelity. It shows ignorant people that they are human just like you.\n\nI think the title &quot;Freaks&quot; is interesting. I think there is two ways to look at it. The first way is the obvious and offensive way demeaning the performers but I think by the end of the film the only freaks in this movie are the people who look normal. The movie shows this makeshift family coming together for each other, the only people who are outcasts are the able bodied &quot;normal people&quot;. I think that is one way to interpret it any way or maybe I am reading into it.\n\nThat is the interesting thing about this movie. You can read a lot into it and it is never clear what the director was really trying to say as another interesting part is all of the performers are shown to be good people, kind people for the most part friendly and loving. Once again the only truly evil people in this movie are the people who are able bodied people. The reason I lean to the side of the director was showing these people are simply just people is it is framed as shocking and wrong when bad things happen to the performers and I don&apos;t think it is ever played for laughs.\n\nIt also really bothers me that this movie is labelled a horror movie. It is a drama. There isn&apos;t really any horror elements to be found.\n\nOne more thing I just want to point out is that I am astounded how much Ryan Murphy took from this movie for season 4 of American Horror Story. Like I think his only reference point for &quot;freak shows&quot; was this movie. Just a stray observation.\n\nSo I would say definitely watch this movie. It is only short as it was cut down due to the fact people believed it was too outrageous and offensive. It has a lot of heart and is really head of it&apos;s time.",

      "name": "Though it does contain some memorable scenes, this is a lesser of a film than the later entries... fortunately, this is the last of the bad films",
      "reviewBody": "This is the last of the poor movies regarding the Olsen Gang. The last true example of poor writing and a lack of creativity. After this, they truly start getting clever and sophisticated. There are good things in this - the speech near the end and the main robbery both leap to mind - the problem is that they&apos;re few and far apart. The plot starts out fine(if the initial, pre-credits robbery is below what the Gang would usually be caught doing(literally)(though it is, admittedly, based on a rather humorous observation)), but it quickly gets off track. Unrealistically fast developments, too many mix-ups(though not as many as in the first) and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of lucky coincidences. More of the famous and beloved trademarks are set(this is the first time we see a red suitcase, which later become the definite sign of money being transported as carry-on luggage, and this is also the first time Ove Verner Hansen is seen and introduced as a threatening presence(then again, with his physique, what else could he be?), though not in the role we later become accustomed to him playing), and the series slowly reaches the quality that we Danes remember it for. This is less than the former, but not worse than the first two(and slightly better, on some things). The humor is mostly silly... still some humane details, but the satire is less biting and accurate. Slapstick is present. There was even a point where two characters burst into song. Luckily, from the next film and onwards, this transcends the typical Danish film of this period... something this one, except for as far as a few attributes go, cannot claim to have accomplished. Yet again, the writers bring in a rivaling gang of criminals... third time&apos;s the charm, huh? It might have been effective to at least separate the films where you use this plot item... three films in a row, all with the major opposition coming from the same basic group of people(and not the police, at that). The two petty thieves are hardly credible as the long-time nemesis of The Olsen Gang... they&apos;re certainly less talented. The character of Sonja, the younger sister of the younger thief seems to be added mainly to attract the young male crowd. How else to explain the utterly gratuitous shot of her getting into the jacuzzi naked(from the back, but still)? Jesper Langberg takes over from Peter Steen(apparently portraying the same character?) in making fun of the police, but to much less effect. The new police chief is fine, but Watt-Boolsen suits the later role(s) as a criminal/businessman(in these films, the line between the two trades can be quite thin) much better. Similarly, Arthur Jensen is far more entertaining in his later supporting roles than in his performance as The King, the older of the two thieves. Claus Ryskjær has a nice, if tiny, role where he is his usual neurotic self(later to be given a larger role in the ninth film). The planning aspect of the film starts to take shape for the later films nicely this time around, but Bahs and Balling has Egon make a ridiculous mistake in this(not to mention the endless mix-ups and coincidences between the various characters) that we&apos;d never see the Egon of later films do. In fact, many of his actions in this seem tailor-made simply to allow The King and The Jack to get the better of him. A less well-written effort, but also the last of the poor ones. Grant it a viewing for the jokes and gags on confirmation, and then rush on to the remaining films of the series. I recommend this to only the biggest of The Olsen Gang fans. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "`Half Man, Half Ant, All Terror!,&apos; screams the promotional for fictional film producer Lawrence Woolsey&apos;s newest film, Mant. Mant is the film within the 1993 film titled Matinee. \tMatinee, starring John Goodman as the William Castle-like Woolsey, is director Joe Dante&apos;s valentine to all of us who grew up in the middle of the cold war. That he has managed to combine a salute to the science fiction films of the 1950&apos;s and early 60&apos;s with a warning about nuclear power and human imperfection is quite impressive. \tThe plotline is straightforward. Woolsey and his delightful lover, leading lady and all around Girl Friday Ruth, ably played by Cathy Moriarty, (who shows she could have been a great 50&apos;s sci-fi heroine), roll into Key West, Florida for a sneak preview of his latest film, Mant. The weekend of the big event, autumn of 1962, also happens to be the time of the Cuban missile crisis. Here the story gets a little stretched as we try to keep up with all that is going on. Panicky theatre managers, adolescent love and jealousy, and several amusing scenes from Mant are among the many points of interest against the sobering backdrop of the missile crisis, only 90 miles away in Cuba. This film is a bit hard to describe, the best thing to do is rent it and enjoy it for yourself. Much of it takes place in the theatre on Saturday afternoon and is a true trip down memory lane for old guys like me who lived during this era and remember very well what indoor theatres were like in 1962. \tMant is a special treat for all of us who love the sci-fi films of that era. It has several un-credited science fiction legends in it (Kevin McCarthy, William Schallert and Robert Cornthwaite appeared with the sultry Moriarty) and numerous insider jokes. McCarthy was `General Ankrum.&apos; Oh Brother! Is there a sci-fi fan anywhere who is not aware that the late Morris Ankrum made a career of portraying military generals in these types of films? This is only one example of a ton of fun in this film. \tThere were other appearances by old time favorites, such as Jesse White and Roger Corman regular Dick Miller. It is obvious that everyone had a good time making Matinee and just about all of the performances are way over the top, especially Goodman&apos;s. He held his oversized stogie just like Castle used to. \tI&apos;ve heard that there are more Mant scenes in the DVD version of Matinee but I have been unable to locate what has turned out to be a harder to obtain film that I imagined it would or should be. \tMatinee is a warm-hearted gem. By all means make the effort to see this one if you can obtain a copy. I promise, you will not be disappointed.\n\n\tThe Strand Theatre, where the `action&apos; takes place, has a big Milk Duds ad over the snack bar. Hmm . . . sounds like an idea to me!"

Although the film never got a chance to be made nevertheless Pasolini was able to shoot some interviews with Indian people from all walks of life to learn more about the country. He asks them about the effects of industrialization and whether they are in favor or against &apos;population control&apos;. His film starts with a Sikh soldier who would play the leading role in his film about a Maharaja who would have to sacrifice himself in order to save a hungry tiger. Although the topic of this feature film remains somewhat childish as well as controversial, Pasolini has managed to interview a former king and his wife for this purpose. He also got good support in form of interviews by K.A.Abbas and Rajinder Singh Bedi. Pasolini has worked hard for his film is revealed as he travels a lot for filming authentic India. He has chosen exotic locations namely Rajasthan and Bombay to find locations which would do justice to his film. Lastly, Appunti Per Un Film Sull&apos;India is a must watch with numerous interviews with politicians and religious men who share their ideas about India.",

The film contains all the ingredients for the viewer&apos;s pleasure ....... romance humour suspense strangeness ......... I was especially taken aback by the Shundersson mystery. I also found that the film although over 50 years old as I write doesn&apos;t really seem dated in the attitudes and ideas it expresses. Clothes and cars may hark back to the beginning of the 50&apos;s but the dialogues are quite simply timeless. I don&apos;t wish to dwell on the story by let&apos;s say they are lots of twists and turns and a plentiful supply of humour. Of course I have always loved Cary Grant but I find that in this film he turns in a particularly interesting performance, a little above the usual level of the character he plays. It&apos;s also very intersting to watch Grant&apos;s reaction in embarassing situations and notably the &quot;interrogation&quot; carried out before the concert at the end. As for Jeanne Crain, his &quot;wife&quot; I find her every time stunningly beautiful. Professor Elwell&apos;s character must be one of the most obnoxious in the entire history of cinema ......... !!"

This is a classic example of the genre worthy of Lang or Pabst, with an angst-ridden German cop investigating a pedophilia-related murder and finding out more about himself than the crime in question. It&apos;s got a dark, Brooding quality that you only find in Northern European movies, some scenes of incredible brutality, but it&apos;s not totally lacking in faith in human nature. It was also a German who said that those who confront monsters are in danger of becoming monsters themselves (or something like that) and thats as apposite a line to describe this film as any.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s an outstanding outward composure pervading this movie, to the point that it seems impossible not to feel in the end a sense of calm, although the cruelty of some situations. This is probably a typical feature of all oriental pictures and culture as well, but here it is most evident, almost therapeutic. The protagonist is a small, meek, cheerfully dressed, sixty-something woman, in the early stages of Alzheimer&apos;s, who has to look after her troublesome grandson, dramatically connected with a shocking event in the small Korean city where they live. It&apos;s a slow movie, which leaves ample scope to the unsaid and the unwritten, but dripping with strong and deep humanity. Mija reveals such determination in her simple and peaceful going on, holding on, she proves the real strength of real strong people, that strength that does not need any evident outward demonstrations, but only the inner will of a meek nature who continues to see the beauty of a flower or the perfection of an apple, and the beauty of poetry, of course, against the ugliness of men (and here the ugliness of a male chauvinist society is to be underlined). The movie reveals such delicacy, such subtlety and tact while approaching the most disturbing topics, that we as viewers can manage everything, feeling a kind of respect towards us, and feeling also grateful for that. Great work by the director Lee Chang-dong then, and standing ovation for Yun Jung-hee for her intense, poignant, stunning interpretation of Mija. The last shots on her finally achieved poem are petrifying and soothing at the same time, showing an incredible emotional intensity. These are movies that should reach the big screen more often and more widely.",

      "reviewBody": "Michel Deville quietly left us and this world a few weeks ago, and his disappearance would have gone unnoticed, for me at least, if some television stations had not marked the sad event by programming some of his films. A contemporary and colleague of the formidable New Wave generation, Deville was an interesting and quite prolific director. Somewhat more conservatory in style than his more famous colleagues, he was bolder in his choice of themes, making (and sometimes writing) films about unusual relationships between men and women, set in social environments where corruption and ambiguity are rule. He was also considered an excellent &apos;director of actors&apos;, so that the names of most of the famous French actresses and actors of the eras in which he created appear on the credits of his films. &apos;Le Mouton enragé&apos; (the English distribution title is &apos;Love at the Top&apos;), released in 1974, is one such example. I chose to see the film for its formidable cast, and I discovered an interesting movie, a story of social ascension through unusual means that could not have been brought to the screen in this way today, and which, if ever a &apos;remake&apos; is made, will look completely different.\n\nNicolas Mallet is a bank clerk dressed in gray suits and wearing bland ties. Shy and uninteresting, he allows himself to be manipulated by his friend Claude Fabre, a failed writer who lives off private French grammar lessons given in bistros. A kind of puppet manipulated into deeds and adventures far different from his psychological profile. At Claude&apos;s prompting, Nicolas enters into relationships with very different women, then with politicians, leaves his stable job to become an intermediary in politics (today we would call him a lobbyist) and in dubious dealings at an increasingly higher levels. The fun thing is that the scheme succeeds beyond all expectations. The marionette proves to be a talented lover, the women he conquers are gorgeous and the politicians he supports are elected to Parliament. For the manipulator Claude the only reward seems to be the detailed accounts that Nicolas gives about his adventures. Any pyramid business, however, risks eventually collapsing.\n\nIn the story taken from Roger Blondel&apos;s novel, the separation between the roles of men and women in relationships is one that would not be accepted in today&apos;s movies. Nicolas, behind his shyness, is almost a predator seducer and the women who meet him seem to easily become his victims. But is that really how things are? The three women that Nicolas (played by Jean-Louis Trintignant) meets are very different from each other. Marie-Paule (Jane Birkin at the peak of her youth and beauty) may be a prostitute, but she is sincerely in love. Roberte (Romy Schneider in one of her most sensual roles) is looking for an escape from a boring marriage and knows her interests well, even if they fall outside the social norms. Finally, Flora (Florinda Bolkan) manages her relationships in a calculated way and does not lend herself to the role of victim at all. Behind all these social intrigues played with the tools of love is Claude, played by Jean-Pierre Cassel, who today we almost automatically call &apos;the father of ...&apos;, but who was himself a formidable actor. Seeing him in this film we understand where the son inherited his talent but also the look of the man who knows much more than he says. &apos;Le Mouton enragé&apos; is a film that must be seen without prejudice and especially not through the lens of the cinematic moralism of 2023. It is not Michel Deville&apos;s best film, and precisely because of this it is proof that he was a director whose name must neither be forgotten nor ignored.",

I already knew the story (by the way, I&apos;m not a fan boy, just encountered it along the way). I think that the Superman oeuvre is the best plotted out of all these heroes&apos; stories. We get to see the struggles of the father, Jor-el, dealing with the short-sightedness of the civic leaders. We get set up for a future with the three malcontents who are out there somewhere. We get the storied life of Clark Kent/Superman as a kid and the struggles he faced. We get an explanation for the Fortress of Solitude. And finally, there is an introduction to Lex Luther, the mastermind, who will make Superman&apos;s life a continuous battle. Clark has left home and seems to have some real insights. He is prepared. Now the story and future stories will move along. Oh, we will miss the kind and accomplished Christopher Reeve for this and other roles.",

But I also want to mention the role A. Martinez is playing! The way he shows his frustration and anger and at the same time be sympathetic is difficult to do! But he pulls it off! There are a lot of matters that don&apos;t get the attention when it comes to the United States! The native Americans (indians) ore one of them! As an European I don&apos;t know much about their situation! This movie gave me insight in a very entertaining way! From what I have seen on the screen concerning Native Americans (indians) they posses a great sense of humor! Considering what they have been through and what is happening to them now that is simply amazing! I love these kind of stories because they are down to earth and in this case also very funny!",

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of Aardman ever since Wallace and Gromit, I was interested from the get go into seeing Arthur Christmas. Apart from it dragging slightly in the middle, Arthur Christmas was a wonderful film. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, it is all very colourful and beautifully modelled, and the soundtrack is so rousing it makes you want to get out your favourite Christmas Carols/Songs CD and sing along afterwards. The script is mostly witty, if more amusing than laugh-out-loud funny, and the story has a lot of charm and heart to it. The three best assets were the terrific characters, Arthur in particular, makes such a big impression with his likability and his wonderful jumper and I hope to see more of him in the future, the voice cast with a spirited James McAvoy, a jovial Jim Broadbent and a truly inspired Bill Nighy and the real sense of occasion, watching this movie you actually feel that it&apos;s Christmas. All in all, colourful and entertaining, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Although any bollywood fan can predict the story, but interesting part is its execution, its flow. One thing that may disappoint you is one of the metaphor used for love(sharing cold drink). I am not a great fan of love at first sight, but in this case simplicity of characters and naturalism of dialogues/thoughts will force you to digest that. Apart from being wonderfully musical it seems to me the most romantic movie of the decade, rich in family values, close to reality in many aspects. I would say it is must watch for any romantic musical person. I am gonna buy the DVD as soon as my pocket allows me.",

      "reviewBody": "Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don&apos;t see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn&apos;t set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.\n\nSam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Her daughters, along with Ben&apos;s wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story&apos;s warm ending. All is not what it seemed: it&apos;s better and, well, different.\n\nFalk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "In this cross between Who&apos;s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf and A Clockwork Orange, two insolent young psychopaths torment a vacationing family.\n\nIt was hard to organize my thoughts on this movie, never mind rating it. As a thriller, this is a tense, well-acted, and relentless experience, marred only by a contrived sequence two-thirds through in which characters behave in unbelievably stupid fashion. However, said sequence is preceded by an incredibly effective ten-minute take. Unusually lengthy takes are often deemed self-indulgent, but this one is anything but.\n\nAs an ideological statement, though, this film is a failure. And there is no doubt that writer-director Michael Haneke is trying to make a statement. By having one of the psychos address the camera a few times, saying things to the effect that they have to give the viewers their money&apos;s worth, Haneke is essentially wagging his finger at anyone who has ever enjoyed the portrayal of violence in a film. This theme is certainly open to debate, but the problem is that Haneke expresses it in such a condescending way. His harrowing treatment of violence already serves as an excellent counterpoint to other films that glamorize it. There was no need to then leave viewers feeling as though they&apos;d just been lectured by a stern parent.\n\nThe last time a filmmaker made me angry, it was when I saw Independence Day, and it was for the same reason. In both cases, the writer and the director display contempt by assuming their audiences are idiots. My anger didn&apos;t really ignite, though, until I watched a short interview with Haneke on the DVD. It made me never want to see another one of his films. The man is disgustingly full of himself.\n\nSo why the relatively high rating? Because as pretentious and self-important as Haneke is, he is also very talented. The movie is very effective on an emotional level, and it&apos;s possible to watch it while ignoring the director&apos;s wrong-headed decisions.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a documentary done about people that live around the &apos;Tea-Horse&apos; route in a southern region of China bordering Yunnan and Tibet. The route is far less known than its northern counterpart, the Silk Route. I was never aware of it until I saw this film and now I have a desire to visit it some day.\n\nCamera work was visually satisfying. The scenery was unique and gorgeous. Interviews with the locals were honest and unpretentious, although some could be cut short to reduce the overall length of the film from over 2 hours to, say, 90 minutes to make this film a bit tighter and less tedious.\n\nYou will find this film interesting if you care about how people live in that part of the world. The part that is totally disconnected from the economic engine of China; the part where time appears to have stood still for decades. There is this family of devout Catholics, and the story how their members maintained their faith throughout the political turmoil. And there are these two Tibetan brothers who shared a wife and still achieve harmony. And other characters that are very removed from our daily life.\n\nThe film is about simple people, their environment, and their aspirations. I find it very educational and visually rewarding.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel&apos;s &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock&apos;s break-out vehicle, 1995&apos;s &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock&apos;s die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (&quot;27 Dresses&quot;) and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.\n\nThe storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.\n\nThey continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family&apos;s enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew&apos;s grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It&apos;s funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis&apos; &quot;Crash&quot; in this film&apos;s establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It&apos;s just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli&apos;s haphazard screenplay doesn&apos;t help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew&apos;s disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.\n\nExcept for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew&apos;s always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens (&quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;) and less like Rose Nylund (&quot;The Golden Girls&quot;). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman (&quot;Watchmen&quot;) is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nuñez (&quot;The Office&quot;) grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.",

There he works in a Volkswagen factory, falls in love, and painfully adjusts to a new and incomprehensible way of life. When he realizes his girlfriend is just using him, Nicola strikes out in violence at her two boyfriends.  Like BREAD AND CHOCOLATE, the film is about the estrangement of the outsider in what is seen as an alien and hostile society. The only difference is that this not a comedy. It also bears some similarities to Visconti&apos;s ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS, with its theme of the corrupting influence of modern industrial society. The film is neatly divided into two parts, the Sicilian half, with its sunny, warm photographic style and the German half, which becomes grayish and grim. Nicola Zarbo is fine in the lead role among a cast of mostly unknown performers. At three hours the film is a trifle too long but thoroughly involving."

I was not expecting such a wonderful portrayal by Mr. Fonda and the accuracy (within Hollywood limits of the time) by Mr. Ford.  I am no Lincoln historian, but I have read enough about him that I recognize the truth in the spirit of this film.  A number of details could certainly be noted as historically inaccurate; on the other hand, the image of Mr. Lincoln as a lawyer who cares for people, truth, and mercy is quite accurate.  One reviewer writes that Mr. Lincoln is made to appear as a country bumpkin, using humor when he is unable to use anything useful.  To the contrary, Mr. Lincoln was realistic about his country origins; he used humor to convince, drive home an important point, and win people to his view; he was self-effacing.  The manner in which Mr. Fonda portrays him in this film does homage to the man. The film may conflate history for entertainment purposes (it is, after all, a Hollywood production), but it is not as unhistorical as many believe. While sentimental (as to be expected of a 1939 film about an American icon), Young Mr. Lincoln is an admirable presentation of the spirit of the man."

(now we know that sound can travel through nothing).\n\nThe film I watched had a lot of aging glitches and spots. I would not mention it but this distracts from the story.\n\nThere are good guys, bad guys, robots, big guns, diamonds, and treachery.\n\nThere may even be hanky-panky.\n\nThis may be good for what&apos;s alien you.",

It&apos;s much -and I really mean MUCH- better than most of the stuff Hollywood chunks out and I bought it on DVD the day I got back! \n\nFor everyone who has ever felt the feeling of losing a love or having an unreachable love, this movie will be very recognizable. It greatly depicts the pain and suffering that can come from true love and although the movie isn&apos;t always as easy to follow, it will captivate you and keep you hooked right up to the end.\n\nApart from the wonderful story, the great backgrounds and superb acting made me an instant fan of Asian cinema. I&apos;d seen a couple of more well known Asian films (like Il Mare for example), but this one opened my eyes entirely. I hope to see more movies like this soon and I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good love story!",

      "reviewBody": "This Cecil B. DeMille movie has all the trademarks of that director. It&apos;s a big and spectacular look at the Old West. Perhaps there&apos;s a bit too much emphasis on creating an epic and not enough on telling a good story.\n\nTo be clear, I don&apos;t mind that it takes so many liberties with historical facts. When I watch a movie I don&apos;t necessarily need a history lesson, and I can forgive a movie taking liberties in order to tell a good story.\n\nHowever, there is little subtlety and emotional weight in the storytelling. In the first half, things happen to move the story along, without necessarily making much sense.\n\nGary Cooper, not my favorite among the western genre&apos;s big stars, is aloof as Wild Bill Hickok. No one can deny his cinematic presence, though. Jean Arthur brings some fun to her role as Calamity Jane. I have seen some reviewers praising her performance, but the problem is, she never seems convincing. Lead actresses of this era were expected to be beautiful, romantic and sensitive, and that&apos;s fine when they play a beautiful, romantic and sensitive woman, which is most of the time. But Calamity Jane? Can we buy Jane Arthur as dissolute, unconventional and wild? The script gives her more to do in this movie than most actresses get in westerns of this period, but she still has to spend the movie mooning after a disdainful Gary Cooper to provide the conventional romance.\n\nI feel like I&apos;m being more negative than the movie deserves. It&apos;s just the it doesn&apos;t always live up to its ambition. Once you accept that you can&apos;t take the story too seriously, you can enjoy it as harmless entertainment. In fact, it finds more focus in the second half of the movie, which is quite fine."

Gilling has never been better than here. This movie inspired an AVENGERS series - 60&apos;s - episode: THE HIDDEN TIGER, especially the cat scenes using subective camera, very very impressive, unforgettable. Andre Morell awesome for this little golden gem. In the US, eight years later, you also had a film which the topic and story telling were very close to this one: EYES OF THE CAT.",

It gets off to a good start, with a good opening credits song, as well as a flavorable music score that plays throughout. Peter Lee Lawrence also makes for an interesting anti hero of sorts, having some negative attributes but also some vulnerabilities. As well, the first half hour or so does click along at a good pace. After that, however, the movie kinds of gets bogged down due to two factors. The first being that there is not quite enough action, and that the movie becomes more of a murder mystery than a western. That last factor might not have been so bad had the mystery been treated less casually and with a lot less talk. Before you think I&apos;m giving this a negative review, I&apos;m really not - I enjoy spaghetti westerns, so I was reasonably entertained by this one. However, I will add that I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be watching it again any time soon."

It felt sharp, atmospheric, there are interesting character situations, emotive moments and infinitely better writing than we had in Prometheus. As it progresses, this feeling continues - thankfully, a solid sci-fi film that got it right. \n\nThen Ridley starts to indulge in his convoluted ideas about creation and destruction. Its like switching from 1977 George Lucas to 1999 Lucas. You can almost hear Ridley at a writing meeting saying &quot;this&apos;ll be cool, and this, and this, and then this&quot; and the writer saying &quot;uh, is this for the same film or later in the series?&quot; &quot;Yeah just cram it all in, make it happen&quot;. \n\nYou end up with three different films - a first act like a modern Alien which I loved, a middle act of Prometheus style philosophizing that feels like more Westworld, then a last act of two shoe-horned in action scenes homaging Aliens and Alien 3 respectively. Except there is no satisfaction at all, because the aliens are rushed, a bit silly, often awkwardly CGI looking, and not even convincing as threats because we don&apos;t care about any of it. \n\nBy the end I just have no idea what to think. I just think it would have worked much better if the ideas were done justice in their own film, rather than ham-fistedly trying to ram them into an Alien film to try and please fans and make box-office.",

      "name": "Great Early Talkie",
      "reviewBody": "Untamed is famous for being Joan Crawford&apos;s first talkie, a curiosity. I had heard it was only a mediocre film by both fans of Crawford and those who really do not care for her. I was surprised that I liked it so much considering these reviews; Untamed is a good quality early talkie and a bright spot in Crawford&apos;s early career.\n\nCrawford plays &quot;Bingo,&quot; an untamed girl from the jungles of South America whose father dies, leaving her with a large oil inheritance. Some old friends of the family escort her to New York where she is to live in luxury, but they are startled when she abruptly falls in love with Robert Montgomery. They convince her that there are hundred of men like him in New York; she goes there to find that she yearns for him more than ever. She finds that he misses her too and the two plan to get married, until Crawford&apos;s uncle meddles again. The end of this film is quite shocking, and there are plenty of moments to entertain throughout.\n\nUnlike her later 1930s films, Crawford is wild and free here, sort of like a Trilby yet to find her Svengali. Her personality is radiant and she acts much more like a savage than a society girl. This pre-code film has her kicking her legs up to throw up her skirt, sleeping in a man&apos;s room, seeing him before he is dressed, drinking large quantities of alcohol during Prohibition, and condoning violence, an unladylike characteristic. Montgomery is terribly handsome in this film, a great romantic lead for Crawford. Perhaps this is the reason they starred in several other films together. The two sing several times here; neither has an outstanding voice, but the music helps add some realism and entertainment to the screen.\n\nOverall, this is not only a curiosity, but a great early film. It does not suffer from the slow pacing, static camera, wordy dialogue, and loud silences that other early talkies did. Be sure to give it a proper chance.",

      "reviewBody": "JAN DARA is one of those rare films that succeeds on many levels: the story as adapted from a famous Thai novel &apos;The Story of Jan Dara&apos; by Utsana Phleungtham is one of intrigue and exploration of lust, revenge, and thwarted passion; the cinematography by Nattawut Kittikhun is incredibly atmospheric while at the same time pausing for some of the most beautiful studies of nature on film; the musical score by Chartchai Pongprapapan and Pakawat Waiwitaya mixes the exotic pentatonic Oriental melodies with quaint excerpts from early recordings of Richard Strauss and Puccini operas; the direction by Nonzee Nimibutr is so sensuously elegant that this film firmly establishes him as an important figure in international film-making.\n\nSimply stated, the story is about Jan Dara, the son of a woman who died giving birth to him, his life as an abused and unwanted child in the house of his &apos;father&apos; spent searching for the love of his lost mother, his first encounters with passion and love, his adaptation to the realities of surviving in a family fraught with conflicts and bizarrely tangled interrelationships, and the disillusionment that comes with the discovery of his true family history and how the way his life comes full circle. It is a period piece and includes the outside effects of WW II in an otherwise sequestered house of strange isolation.\n\nWhile JAN DARA includes many sensuous scenes (the &apos;first memory&apos; of Jan Dara is watching his &apos;father&apos; in an indiscretion with his beloved aunt), these scenes are photographed so sensitively that they become studies like Kama Sutra paintings rather than being vulgar. The story makes many flashbacks and flash-forwards and keeping the various actors at the different ages of these sequences straight can be problematic. The cast is uniformly excellent and credible, even when they may be too evil to watch! Here is an example of Oriental films that don&apos;t rely on choreographic martial arts to sustain interest. In that way it is similar to the beautiful SPRING, SUMER, AUTUMN, WINTER, SPRING, and for those who enjoy the subtle arts of Asia this film is a must. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "Quebec in winter is a powerful setting for this, the umpteenth amnesia movie. Nothing makes sense for the hero after someone tries to pull the plug on him while he&apos;s in a coma and only succeeds in waking him up. We are equally baffled, and frankly we are not enlightened much in the ensuing 90 minutes. When Alex demands of his doctor why his personal circle is behaving in completely contradictory fashion, we hang on his every word. &quot;You are picking up on their deeper feelings&quot; is all the doctor can offer. Evidently, he&apos;s as baffled as any of us. Alex does have a breakthrough of sorts, when he penetrates a deep memory that had nothing to do with him going into a coma, but occurred about 34 years earlier. Er, as I said...it&apos;s baffling. Other big-grossing and award-winning pictures have had ludicrously unsatisfactory denouements, e.g. Clint Eastwood&apos;s Mystic River, but Memoires Affectives takes the cake. How the director managed to persuade the producers to finance this confusing confection is not clear. Probably Roy Dupuis could appear for 90 minutes asleep in bed and someone would cough up a few million. In spite of being so utterly daft, the picture sucks you in engagingly for its duration --- but don&apos;t waste any time trying to work it out afterwards.",

      "reviewBody": "A year before Al Pacino got his career role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather he and Kitty Winn got great reviews as a pair of junkies in The Panic In Needle Park. This film is a brutal and realistic look at the New York&apos;s nasty world of the narcotics addict as seen through Pacino and Winn.\n\nEven in this world romance can bloom even among these folks on the bottom most rung of society. Still the need for the needle overrules all, a fact that narcotics cop like Jesse Vint exploits to the max.\n\nRichard Bright who plays Pacino&apos;s older brother who is a burglar by trade and not a junkie delivers a good performance. My one criticism of he Panic In Needle Park is Bright&apos;s willingness to take Pacino in on a job. Any good burglar wouldn&apos;t rust a junkie even if he was family.\n\nThe scenes showing the heroin use are brutally realistic. One scene that jolted me was the efforts to save Pacino from a hot shot dose of pure heroin. Done by his fellow narcotics peers without any professional medical help.\n\nNot much has changed in the junkie world in the intervening half a century since Needle Park came out. The real tragedy of this film.",

But the more Mature and Well Grounded Children are sure to Get a Thrill from this CGI Ride that is Full of Fantastic Images and Stirring Action.\n\nIt is Pathos that the Movie Embraces and the Good and Evil are Reversed somewhat but there are still Characters Worth Rooting for and others to Hiss and Boo. \n\nHaters of this Backstory seem to be Under the Delusion that the Original Fairy Tale and the Original Disney Animated Movie have been Purged from Existence with some Sort of Orwellian Eraser and Cease Existing to Enjoy.\n\nBoth are still there to be Perused and Appreciated, this is just something a bit Different, Not a Replacement. Angelina Jolie makes a Great Maleficent and is backed by an Array of Colorful and Interesting Fairies and other assorted Moor Magnificence. \n\nThankfully there are No Outburst of Sappy, Old-Fashioned, Done-to Death Songs Interrupting the Story and it Plays out like a Truly Grim Fairy Tale. True Love comes in Many Forms and is not always found in a Traditional way, there could be others, and this is Not a Replacement, it&apos;s just Manifested in Another Form.\n\nThe Film certainly Looks Seamless incorporating Live Action and Animation. The Three Fairies are Amazing, and the Whole Movie is Spellbinding in a somewhat &quot;New&quot; Kind of Look from Modern Artistry.\n\nDefinitely Recommended for Those that Don&apos;t always Take the Path Well Traveled and are Willing to Accept and Embrace New Directions as New Entertainment and this Does Not Eliminate the Old, but Enhances with Enchantment.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw this last night and was blown away by it. For me it played as an intense psychological study of infidelity and addiction. The performances are taught and understated, as is the direction, with attention often focused on minute details.\n\nI&apos;ve seen negative reviews of this film from two different perspectives. One is the art-house maven who feels the scenes of sexual violence are gratuitous and in poor taste; Kevin Maher&apos;s comments in the Guardian are an example. Once these reviews have had an airing they tend to attract gorehounds, some of whom (going by online reviews) had been led to expect a genre movie and were disappointed. Hence you get a lot of complaints about slow pace, unresolved endings, lack of gore etc etc.\n\nThe movie does contain some quite disturbing scenes, but they serve to heighten the emotional drama that the film&apos;s really about rather than being an end in themselves. You&apos;ve probably seen plenty of things more graphic than this without straying into the outer reaches of the horror genre. The sexualisation of the violence does make it more potentially upsetting, as does the psychological context Denis so delicately builds up.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, this isn&apos;t supposed to be a plot-driven action movie, but the storytelling is impeccable. The ambiguous ending is absolutely logical, and people who say it &quot;doesn&apos;t end properly&quot; astonish me. The ending makes perfect sense in light of everything that&apos;s gone before.\n\nThe back-story about the pharmaceutical company etc is pretty cheesy, but it helps to have some kind of nod towards an explanation for what&apos;s happened to the lead characters, and that&apos;s really all it is.\n\nI think this one is going to stay with me a long time and I&apos;d definitely re-watch it."

      "reviewBody": "TOWER OF EVIL \n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\n\nSound format: Mono\n\nWhilst searching for ancient treasure on a lighthouse-island off the British coastline, an archaeological expedition becomes isolated from the mainland and is stalked by a monstrous assassin.\n\nA trash classic from the heyday of British exploitation, TOWER OF EVIL was helmed and written by Jim O&apos;Connolly, a journeyman director whose career peaked several years earlier with THE VALLEY OF GWANGI (1968), one of Ray Harryhausen&apos;s best films. Thrown together on a microscopic budget, and based on a script by novelist George Baxt (responsible for such memorable British thrillers as CIRCUS OF HORRORS, THE CITY OF THE DEAD and NIGHT OF THE EAGLE), &quot;Tower...&quot; hedges its commercial bets by emphasizing a couple of high profile cameos (Dennis Price and Anthony Valentine) and foregrounding liberal doses of self-conscious nudity and gore. The opening scenes - in which crusty sea dogs Jack Watson and George Coulouris visit the eponymous lighthouse and stumble on a series of mutilated corpses - sets the tone for much of what follows, and while the main cast are pretty colorless, their mutual antagonism (borne from a convoluted history of infidelity) adds much-needed shading to the basic narrative outline.\n\nMounted on sparse but effective studio sets (designed by THE Italian JOB&apos;s Disley Jones), and photographed by veteran cinematographer Desmond Dickinson - a major player in the glory days of British cinema, whose resumé includes everything from Olivier&apos;s HAMLET (1948) to THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST (1952), HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM (1959) and A STUDY IN TERROR (1965) - the film is cheapened at every turn by amateurish dialogue and threadbare visual effects (no attempt is made to disguise back-projected elements during scenes on the &apos;open sea&apos;, for instance), but these cut-price elements have simply contributed to the film&apos;s enduring appeal. Besides, the movie makes few pretensions to &apos;Art&apos;, and O&apos;Connolly stages the major set-pieces with real technical savvy, culminating in a &apos;twist&apos; ending which seems to have inspired a similar plot development in Tom De Simone&apos;s superior HELL NIGHT (1981).\n\nThe cast is toplined by Bryant Haliday (a favorite of producer Richard Gordon), former Broadway actress Jill Haworth (THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR), Mark Edwards (BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY&apos;S TOMB) and Derek Fowlds (TV&apos;s &quot;Yes, Minister&quot;), while the younger players include Robin Askwith (already a movie veteran, long before his appearance in the &quot;Confessions...&quot; films), physique model John Hamill (a familiar face in UK exploitation movies of the 1970&apos;s, and later the co-writer of Bob Clark&apos;s TURK 182!), Candace Glendenning (SATAN&apos;S SLAVE) and the late Anna Palk (in her last screen appearance), all of whom are featured in various states of undress. The film was originally screened in the US as HORROR ON SNAPE ISLAND, and later reissued as BEYOND THE FOG.\n\nNB. Interested viewers should check out Simon Hunter&apos;s LIGHTHOUSE (1999) - originally released in the US as DEAD OF NIGHT - an outstanding British shocker which covers the same territory, but to much greater effect.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a decent film, for the most part a very watchable telling of a good true story which is worth knowing about. Gary Cooper is solid in the title role (albeit he is apparently nothing like the real-life Mitchell) and the drama moves along at a reasonable pace.\n\nBut for 17 minutes towards the end it rises above that and becomes mesmerising. What makes the difference? Two words: Rod Steiger. The cross-examination scene, where he goads and scorns Cooper mercilessly, is one of those very rare moments in cinema when a performance holds the screen and burns itself into your memory. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I always spend the first hour or so waiting to relish this particular scene. And I am never disappointed.\n\nSo watch the film for two reasons: it is good in its own right. A well-played, thoughtful and dignified film about a good man who was ahead of his time. But whatever you do, make sure you don&apos;t miss the last half-hour!",

Others are followers of the humane Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe). In the end, Barnes and Elias are in a struggle for Chris&apos; soul.\n\nThis is the quintessential Vietnam war movie. Oliver Stone has recreated the jungle combat and placed a morality tale in the middle of it. It is possibly Charlie Sheen&apos;s greatest performance. His innocence at the beginning evolves into a grizzled veteran fighter. The combat is so realistic, and the story is so compelling. It is a must see for all movie goers.",

It&apos;s nowhere near as good as the first. The format is similar. We begin with an action-packed opening. In Las Vegas, mobsters want to kill Cathy Moriarty (as Luella &quot;Lu&quot; Delano) because she&apos;s going to testify against them. This leads to the explosion of what appears to be a small town. Police search the rubble, but can&apos;t find Ms. Moriarty...\n\nThey think the missing woman is going to contact a couple - Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman (as Brian and Pam O&apos;Hara) - so Mr. Dreyfuss and Mr. Estevez are recruited to pose as neighbors...\n\nMadeline Stowe (as Maria), from the first film, appears only sporadically and her chemistry with Dreyfuss is gone. The crime and criminals being investigated are confusing. To make the ruse more realistic, assistant district attorney Rosie O&apos;Donnell (as Gina Garrett) is added to the mix. Accompanied by her rottweiler &quot;Archie&quot;, Ms. O&apos;Donnell pretends to be Dreyfuss&apos; second wife and Estevez&apos; step-mother. It&apos;s a funny situation, providing this sequel with a little freshness. Otherwise, the story is stale.\n\n***** Another Stakeout (7/23/93) John Badham ~ Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O&apos;Donnell, Dennis Farina",

      "reviewBody": "The theactrical release of Disturbing Behavior is an utter mess of a movie. It has plot holes that the biggest human being in the world could jump through. It moves along at an uneasy pace and at 83 minutes it isn&apos;t much of a movie. However, this isn&apos;t the filmmakers fault. Blame the studio that released the film. They basically ordered him to cut everything that made the movie make sense and what we got to see was a studio hack job.\n\nThe Dvd on the other hand is another story. It provides at least 20 minutes of deleted scenes and when you watch them along with the rest of the movie everything begins to make sense and it makes me grow a new-found appreciation for the film. It isn&apos;t cinematic gold but when you look at what the film was like before it may just look like a masterpiece.\n\nThe premise is pretty unique. In Cradle Bay failure and misbehaving is a no no. You wil be perfect....or else. When newcommer steve moves to cradle bay he meets gavin who thinks a sinister force is taking over the kids of cradle bay turning them into a group of kids known as the the Blue ribbons. The blue ribbons appear to be perfect with their good grades and bake sales but beneath the surface lies a mal-function that makes them act violently.\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\nThe character of Gavin in both versions of this film remains intact. I completely loved this character and he&apos;s played really well y Nick Stahl. I was quite impressed\n\nAll the Blue Ribbons are creepy as hell. It&apos;s like they came out of an acid-induced version of leave it to beaver or the Brady Bunch.\n\ni like the general idea of the film. Someone trying to make teenagers perfect because we know not we do was pretty interesting to me.\n\nI liked th entire Dvd version of the film. It honestly explains so much and it raises the films level from crap to about average.\n\nWhat I Didn&apos;t Like:\n\nThe theatrical release is filled with mistakes. It&apos;s too short, the pacing is off, and it ends on a pretty sour note. There are no redemming aspects of this version except for the character of Gavin.\n\nThe scene in the insane asylum was pretty dumb. I don&apos;t expect much realism out of these films but this was above and beyond being real.\n\nThe characters with the exception of Gavin don&apos;t really fit their roles. I didn&apos;t by James Marsden as a hero. He was quite bland as well. Katie Holmes, who is actually good on Dawson&apos;s Creek and in The Gift, and Wonder Boys, doesn&apos;t really fit as the rebel gothic girl.\n\ni suggest that everyone that bashed this movie, like me when i firt saw it, go see the DVD version. I promise you that you&apos;ll have a better understanding on what is going on and it may make the film a little better for you.\n\nTheatrical Version: 2/10\n\nDVD Version: 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Fright (1971) is directed by Peter Collinson, a largely under-rated film-maker who received his only positive notices for the film The Italian Job, though in reality he made a fair few good films such as Innocent Bystanders and The Earthling.\n\nThe story is simple, but fairly engrossing: a young babysitter in a lonely mansion is terrorised by an escaped homicidal lunatic. The babysitter is nicely played by Susan George and the maniac is very convincingly portrayed by Ian Bannen.\n\nThe film starts out just fine, with some careful and genuinely suspenseful build up scenes. Every now and then, we are fed another clue that someone unpleasant is hanging around outside the mansion... Dennis Waterman is assaulted whilst walking through the grounds; we see a cloudy figure sneaking past the kitchen door as George boils the kettle, etc. The film is pretty scary early on, and I&apos;m not embarrassed to admit that the hairs on my neck were prickling a bit.\n\nHowever, it all goes wrong later on. The maniac turns up about a third of the way in and the effective suspense suddenly gives way to sadism and over-the-top hysterics. Bannen, as mentioned earlier, plays the part very well, but the lines he has to speak and his actions are ludicrously and needlessly savage. I know he&apos;s meant to be a bad man, but his nastiness just seems too excessive. Collinson forgets to keep the suspense ticking over and lunges for the audiences jugular, dragging down what could have a great little thriller and turning into a mere exploitation shocker."

The only problem with it is that it seems virtually unknown in Scotland and it saddens me to think that so many British children might never know the joys of this piece of total magic. It should be compulsory.",

      "name": "Well, at least Kate Hudson is charming",
      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a scene early in the movie where Kate convinces a guy to let her friend into a club even though her friend isn&apos;t on the &quot;list.&quot; Kate leans over, puts her head on the dude&apos;s chest, writes the girl&apos;s name, and comments, &quot;Now she&apos;s on the list.&quot; Worked like a charm. Come on, how many guys can resist that? What? Oh, I mean besides any of the male designers on &quot;Trading Spaces.&quot; Kate pretty much does the same thing with this movie. She smiled, blinked her eyes at me, giggled a little, put her head on my chest, and convinced me to keep watching.\n\nThis isn&apos;t a great movie, but Kate&apos;s smile and personality are enough to keep it from being a chore to watch. However, if you were to replace Kate with someone like Kirsten Dunst, then I would&apos;ve been out of the theater in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe story isn&apos;t really original, and to no one&apos;s surprise it&apos;s pretty predictable as well. Carefree gal is loving life. Tragedy intervenes and forces her to change lifestyle. Someone (older sister, Joan Cusack) is there to provide conflict. Carefree gal decides she truly CAN handle her new life. Tears are shed, hands are held, hugs are in groups, and &quot;Kumbaya&quot; is figuratively sung. Roll credits.\n\nIf you&apos;re expecting loads of laugh, then you&apos;re likely to be disappointed. This movie focuses more on the dramatic, especially near the end where things just start to get way too sappy for any guy not named Richard Simmons. But there are some cute and funny moments sprinkled throughout, most as a direct result of Kate&apos;s charm. However, John Corbett (who plays a Lutheran pastor) has a great line when he tells Kate, &quot;I&apos;m a sexy man of God, and I know it.&quot;\n\nJoan Cusack does a pretty good job as well. Kate is the coolest aunt in the world, while Joan is the most motherly. You see, Joan&apos;s the aunt who&apos;ll kick your butt and make you mad, but she&apos;s the kind of person kids need around &apos;em. She has one of the best scenes in the movie when she shows up at a hotel and totally lays the smack down on a little punk who took her 15-year-old niece (Hayden Panettiere) there during prom. The older women in the movie theater clapped and cheered. Little boys dream about being superheroes, baseball players, and firemen. Little girls dream about being princesses, actresses, and dating Kirk Cameron (well, at least Stephanie did). But this scene is what mothers and aunts dream about.\n\nIf you want to see a much better movie dealing with a similar &quot;my lifestyle will completely change because of this tragedy&quot; theme, then I recommend &quot;Jersey Girl.&quot; But those of you who are in dire need of some big-screen Kate Hudson should be satisfied as long as you&apos;re not looking for a movie to challenge you or have you guffawing in your seat. \n\nTHE GIST\n\n&quot;Raising Helen&quot; is truly a chick flick, and it should definitely please its intended female audience. But guys, if you like Kate Hudson, then it&apos;s not the worst movie to sit through if you wanna score some points by taking your lady to see this. If you&apos;re the type of person who can cry during a long-distance phone commercial then this is movie gold for you."

      "reviewBody": "In the Broadway musical smash &quot;A Chorus Line,&quot; one of the auditioning dancers sings rapturously of how her real life contrasted sharply and poignantly with the glamorous world of the ballet, where &quot;everything was beautiful.&quot; This sensational, down-and-dirty documentary puts that dream-like memory into an altogether different but no less thrilling perspective. More than two dozen of the 20th century&apos;s greatest ballet dancers are interviewed and featured in extensive, rare, and breathtaking original period footage that is continuously absorbing and illustrative of the changing styles and influences that resulted from the ersatz &quot;ballet wars&quot; that followed upon the death of impresario Serge Diaghilev at the end of the Roaring 20s. The complex history of competing impresarios and showmen from Massine and Balanchine to Hurok to Da Basil--with a little Agnes DeMille thrown in for good measure--is rich in irony, pathos and, yes--drama! I am not educated about the Dance and so I cannot offer cogent criticism about the myriad issues presented or any of their potential biases/omissions. But I know a ripping good time when I have had one, and this film rates up there with the best documentaries about artists I have ever seen. I never expected a précis of Ballet in America, as one poster indicated; the title is, after all, The Ballets Russes. For this uneducated but interested onlooker, I was mesmerized--not only to see how many of these great artists are still alive (many in their late 80s and early 90s) but to learn from an example they set of how active and vital they remain today--and to see them in antique footage (when some were still teen age &quot;baby ballerinas&quot;) is a joy and a privilege. Hearing about the backstage power struggles is juicy fun and endlessly entertaining--all that supposed high brow stuff is really just like watching the intrigues on &quot;Dynasty,&quot; but with class, great technique, and charmingly Russian-accented anecdotes. Seeing these personalities in photos and action footage as they interact with the great choreographers and ballet masters is wondrous--and watching the likes of Matisse and Dali designing sets and costumes for their work--sublime. What a rich and rewarding world it was, as well as one of great struggle and sacrifice. We glimpse it all, as well as the shadowing arc of its glorious history.\n\nI could have watched this for another two or so hours without once stirring in my seat. For those who do love the dance, this is a &quot;must-see,&quot; and for those with only a passing interest, it cannot fail to capture your attention. This has been a particularly fine year for documentary films and the Oscar voters will have quite a time deciding from the list of deserving nominees. If I were a voting member, I would be checking the box next to this film&apos;s title.",

It turned out to be yet another example of why I prefer films made outside of the U.S. The writing was first-rate and hilarious, and the performances were uniformly brilliant. Tom Cavanaugh is one of the most watchable comedic talents anywhere, Ben Shenkman (who reminds me a lot of Harold Ramis) was equally superb, and young actors Noah Bernett (as Scot) and Dylan Everett (Ryan) really shined in their roles as well. There are plenty of laughs and poignant moments in equal measure, with the underlying theme of accepting and loving others for who they are. Hockey is a major focus in the film, but it can be enjoyed by those who aren&apos;t familiar with the game. Aside from a few instances of salty language (including a couple &quot;f-bombs&quot;), it&apos;s family-friendly and the issues involved are handled with tact and gentle humor. Highly recommended.",

They work outside of the official organizations like FBI, CIA etc., so they can do stuff that real agents can&apos;t... Not that this is really shown in this movie. Her character is named Angel Harmony and in the movie she has to work with real agents to stop the mad scientist or something like that. If these agents are the saviors and protectors of the USA and the whole world, well, we are doomed. And this Angel Harmony should be the best of the best! OK, Marilyn looks good and it&apos;s great to watch her naked. There is some nudity but there should be more, then H.E.A.T. would be better trash. And if one have seen Chambers previous movies one is expecting more tits at least. Also Mary Woronow offers also some skin and nothing to complain about that either.\n\nAction sequences are poor. Well, whole production is of course cheap and it shows.\n\nThere are some interesting characters besides Angel. In these kind of B-movies there&apos;s always has to be a midget and here we have one who tries to score our beautiful lady. Also, we have Asian martial arts expert called Hans (!) and Aryan looking agent called Wong (!) who is played by adult star Randy West.\n\nSerious movie watchers: don&apos;t bother.

      "name": "Very good, though so close to the 1931 version that this one doesn&apos;t seem all that necessary",
      "reviewBody": "I had the fortune of seeing BOTH this version and the 1931 Frederic March version only about a week apart. Because of this it gave me an excellent chance to compare and contrast them. And it also gave me a chance to see that the two films were extremely similar--so similar that the later MGM film seems more a remake of the 1931 film and not an adaptation of the original book. There was much more similarity between the movies than the book. And, while they both are good, I would definitely say that I preferred the earlier version.\n\nSince the 1931 film was made during the so-called &quot;Pre-Code&quot; era before the guidelines of the production code governing morality in pictures was enforced, it is a more &quot;earthy&quot; and sexually charged film. In this earlier version, March develops the chemical formula simply out of curiosity and a desire to &quot;sow wild oats&quot; without detection. In other words, since Mr. Hyde looked more like a half-man/half-chimp, he could whore around without getting caught or ruining his reputation. The 1941 version had much nobler intent, as nice-guy Dr. Jekyll created his elixir in order to separate the good and evil aspects of our personalities so we could live purer and more wholesome lives without our subconscious evil desires impeding us! In addition, since the 1931 version was pre-Code, it tended to show more skin and imply more about sex, whereas the 1941 version showed Hyde more as a sadist. In general, the 1941 version was a little bit tamer and more &quot;family-friendly&quot;, though I think both are fine for older kids.\n\nThere were a few negatives I noticed in this otherwise well-made film. One was that Hyde looked almost exactly like Dr. Jekyll. This MIGHT have been a daring and intelligent way to take the movie (though certainly NOT in keeping with Robert Lewis Stevenson&apos;s book)--showing the &quot;monster&quot; as looking like a sloppy man, but a man nevertheless. However, this makes no sense, as Ingrid Bergman (the woman Hyde desires) already met Dr. Jekyll BEFORE meeting Hyde and yet couldn&apos;t see that they were the same guy! At the very least, she should have thought they were brothers! But, to go to Dr. Jekyll and complain about how abusive Hyde was just seemed silly.\n\nAlso another quibble is with the choice of Ms. Bergman as the earthy barmaid (in the 1931 version, she seemed more like a prostitute than a member of the working poor). Changing her part a bit wasn&apos;t the problem, but that Ingrid sounded like a Swedish lady trying to sound Cockney--which is what she was! At times, she forgot the accent altogether and at other times she just sounded kind of weird. She was a wonderful actress, but the casting decision was dumb.\n\nAs far as Tracy goes, he was fine as Jekyll, but there were times when it was obvious that you were watching a stuntman instead of Tracy. The scenes just weren&apos;t done very well and you can&apos;t blame Tracy for this but the director. Just watch the scene in the hallway after Hyde&apos;s confrontation with Bergman--it&apos;s pretty obvious that the guy jumping about isn&apos;t Tracy and it doesn&apos;t look much like him.\n\nOne observation about Tracy. I&apos;ve recently read a biography about him and choosing him to play the lead was pretty interesting because in real life, Tracy definitely had a &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; personality. When he was sober (which apparently wasn&apos;t often enough), he was a sweet guy, but when he drank he was abusive and very reminiscent of the dreaded Hyde. I wonder if anyone at the time noticed this.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;American Gigolo&quot; really is slick and stylish. As slick and stylish as any film could be, so you really wonder whether this is Schrader&apos;s film or Jerry Bruckheimer&apos;s? If you look solely at the screenplay, it almost fits into the typical Schrader exploration of any given &apos;seedy underworld&apos;. You could even argue that Julian and Michelle are in a way similar to Travis and Betty. Looking at the final product, however, I see a slick Hollywood mystery-thriller that&apos;s actually far more interesting for its romantic sub-plot than for any of the suspense parts. \n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, in places &quot;American Gigolo&quot; is a quality character study, and the romance is as well-written as you could ever expect from a major, mainstream Hollywood production, but the suspense thriller portion is just so banal, expected, and predictable that it really takes away from an otherwise very good film. Perhaps most worthy of praise here is Richard Gere who gives one of his best performances here, and I certainly cannot even begin to imagine John Travolta in the lead role.\n\nIt sounds like I&apos;m criticizing how stylish this film is, I&apos;m really not. It&apos;s pulled off pretty darn well in comparison to how many films of this sort have ended up, and you have to admit Gere&apos;s wardrobe is impressive. The film is well-shot and well-acted and for the most part quite well-written (although this is far, far from Paul Schrader&apos;s best work as a screenwriter). My comments on the film&apos;s slickness are really just a natural reaction to this film coming right after &quot;Hardcore&quot;. Indeed, it seems like this film is a signpost for the early 80&apos;s (the dud of a score proves it) where in Hollywood even homicide cases with a Gigolo as the main suspect are glamorous rather than gritty. \n\nA lot of people hate this film, but it has also gained a large cult following and a respectable following from film critics and aficionados, even landing a spot on the &apos;They Shoot Pictures, Don&apos;t They?&apos; top 1000 list, and I can&apos;t really understand why anyone would have such extreme feelings about a film that is just watchable and entertaining. I don&apos;t think Schrader did his best work here, but it&apos;s not his worst either and the film as a whole is so unimposing and forgettable that I find it hard to believe it has so many fans and so many detractors. \n\n7/10"

Featured here there&apos;s none of his trademark comedic fights, or insanely dangerous stunts, instead we get a gritter, more typically 1980&apos;s R-rated American action flick with plenty of shoot-outs, fist fights and explosions. The level of strong language, along with quite a lot of nudity also sets this apart from the usual Chan flick, but I cannot say I didn&apos;t enjoy this. The action is solid with plenty of it, and for a medium budgeted 80&apos;s action flick this is better than average.",

      "reviewBody": "Wicked Lake is the kind of movie that is so stupid, you sometimes wonder how it got made. In a nutshell the story is about a group of college girls out in the woods, attacked by some deranged perverts only to turn the tables and reveal their true colors.\n\nThis movie is pretty low brow, and really is only about the boobs and blood. The acting is really bad, the story in execution is terrible. Everything about this is cheap and poorly done. That said I give it props for at least a different take on the home invasion genre, and I will admit I did get excited to see Tim Thomerson in it (even though you can fully tell he was it in it for a paycheck).\n\nOverall it&apos;s pretty bad, but not the worst thing I&apos;ve ever seen.",

Must have been fairly good as I still remember scenes now, 12 years on.  At the time, I was doing a Ph.D in philosophy so that may have been part of my reason for noticing the film.  It&apos;s about a boring, nerdy academic type who publishes a text on Heraclitus and somehow attracts the attention of three attractive women who may or may not be actual muses.  It&apos;s a little slow and humorless at times (it is German, you know), but overall a decent flick.  Worth a viewing."

The director has also reserved some space of suspense with the plot! All these ingredients make Pokiri a must see for the entire family and not just fans of Mahesh. The cast matches the characters to the tee and every one contributes. You&apos;ll probably want to watch the movie more than once just to hear Mahesh&apos;s dialogs again. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Hats off to Mr. Puri Jagannath!",

      "reviewBody": "THE PATENT LEATHER KID ranks among the great silent films. Based on the best-selling novel by Rupert Hughes, this long and ambitious film is almost two films in one.\n\nRichard Barthelmess, who won an Oscar nomination for best actor, stars as the boxing champion known as the Patent Leather Kid because of his hair (think of Rudolph Valentino). He&apos;s a cocky fighter who, between rounds in the ring, has his fair combed while the opponent gasps for air and is washed down. Molly O&apos;Day plays Curley, a kooch dancer who gets involved with the Kid and brings him down. She&apos;s a bad-luck gal and diverts the Kid&apos;s attentions from his business: boxing.\n\nThe comes World War I. The second half of the film shows the horrors of war as the Kid struggles in the trenches. Who should also arrive in Europe but Curley, who is now a nurse.\n\nBoth Barthelmess and O&apos;Day are exceptional in the final scenes when the wounded Barthelmess is delivered to the hospital. He&apos;s been wounded after a n heroic deed. He&apos;s caked in muck and mud and O&apos;Day is just superb as she wipes away the mud from his face and slowly starts to recognize the Kid. The doctor has so many casualties to deal with he&apos;s willing to let Barthelmess die because he&apos;s so badly wounded, but O&apos;Day begs and pleads and the doctor relents. He lives but is badly crippled.\n\nAs the war grinds on there is a wonderful and moving finale involving the American flag.\n\nBarthelmess lost the Oscar to Emil Jannings."

Only thing I can complain about is lack of body count and blood, since there are only two persons in the house.\n\nIf you liked The Collector (2009) go for this one too, and vice versa.",

But even that one wasn&apos;t that bad, surprising for a german movie. Nevertheless it soon left the cinema again, and nobody ever talked about it.\n\nThis is a movie about girls, and for girls. Its much more serious than other attempts for making such a movie, so no dirt jokes like, for example, in american pie 2. Instead it is about the problems and wishes of modern girls, such as love, faith, school, freedom, security and rape.\n\nMaybe that was the reason for its failure. A movie about girls, how uncool ? I don&apos;t know, but I can highly recommend this one to anyone interested.",

This film is a wonderful work of art, and it seems that many of the people posting comments here don&apos;t appreciate art. Many have noted the grainy and obscure shots in the movie, that is because it was filmed entirely in digital format.  It is the second film in the InDigEnt series of films shot entirely on digital, and on a budget of $150,000 or less (another film in this project being Richard Linklater&apos;s &quot;Tape&quot;, which is an AMAZING film).  The film was shot over a period of 16 days using Sony PD-100 digital cameras.  As for the writing and characters that have been belittled, these characters are not entirely the creation of screenwriter Nicole Burdette, the story was inspired by the play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; by a man called Dylan Thomas, you may have heard of him... if you haven&apos;t, go to school, and then come back and critique this movie.  Thomas actually resided in the Chelsea at one point in time, as well as Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen.  And if you didn&apos;t enjoy the music of the film by Wilco/Jeff Tweedy... shame on you. Chelsea Walls is a wonderful film, directed by an amazing artist.  For Hawke&apos;s directorial debut, I think he did a wonderful job."

Huston narrates with some additional voice overs by his father, Walter. Suitable mood music permeates most of the film which adds to the color footage&apos;s appeal. When the actual flying sequences are shown, one gets some sense of excitement though since dialogue is kept to a minimum and there are few explosions, it doesn&apos;t seem Hollywood-made to provide unbridled joy to victory. Worth seeing. Watched this on Internet Archive.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not often I watch a film where I haven&apos;t got a clue what&apos;s going on, but that&apos;s what happened in the case of DEMON WARRIORS: come the ending, I still hadn&apos;t the foggiest about what I&apos;d just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who&apos;s advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking &apos;demon warrior&apos; with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the &apos;demon warriors&apos; that are out there.\n\nThere&apos;s some Thai religious mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you&apos;ll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various warriors and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he&apos;s killed – a neat idea that sadly isn&apos;t explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of X-MEN, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.\n\nThere&apos;s action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the demon warriors themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Thanakorn Pongsuwan needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense.",

So I probably deserve it when some celluloid creature like this shambles out of the dark and takes a bite out of me. But, seriously, when someone has an idea for a movie - shouldn&apos;t they, you know, kind of flesh it out? Think it through a few times? Am I being too demanding here? &quot;Episode 50&quot; follows two teams of &quot;psychic investigators&quot;, one secular and one religious, into one of those &quot;most haunted place on Earth&quot; places (of which there are several hundred or so if you watch these kind of TV shows), in this case an old mental hospital. There&apos;s lots of back story concerning the team members, which is constantly being introduced until practically the very last frame of the film. There&apos;s lots happening, with each team presenting conflicting reasons for the ghostly goings on.\n\nAnd there&apos;s practically no coherent overall idea of the film.\n\nThe flimmakers here want to use the &quot;found footage&quot; format AND have their scary background music too. They want to scare us WITHOUT building up tension. They want to slip in a cute little religious message AND have it taken seriously. Heck, the probably want to lose weight by eating ice cream and get rich buying real estate with no money down.\n\nMix the half-baked, nearly incoherent film style with some egregiously bad acting and out pops a film that makes &quot;Return to Pontianak&quot; look like &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Seriously, the most horrible thing about this film is that I spent time watching it.

There are just some movies where you know that you can save that ninety minutes of your life for something more meaningful, and fifteen minutes into this craptacular debacle, I realized that this was indeed one of those cases.\n\nYes, Roger Corman and Company have to make a buck, and he has every right to remake any and every costume horror melodrama that ever helped make him a name. Especially the Vincent Price ones.\n\nSo what&apos;s wrong with HELLFIRE? Well, the storyline is good, and kudos to Corman for reaching out to work with Mosfilm. But the problem is what&apos;s missing here. And what&apos;s missing, you ask? How about Vincent Price&apos;s acting skills, Floyd Crosby&apos;s richly saturated visuals, Daniel Haller&apos;s art direction and the scoring by the irreplaceable Les Baxter? I know what you&apos;re going to say...most of these talented artisans are no longer with us, and the few that still are probably have retired from the business permanently.\n\nWhich is exactly my point.\n\nWhich I also know is moot, since this mess was cooked up over ten years ago now.\n\nNone of the other Corman classics have suffered lately from attempts to remake, revisit or &apos;redefine&apos; them.

      "reviewBody": "Baiju&apos;s (Biju Menon) patronizing hijinks are best enjoyed by those who spent a good part of their childhood outdoors, engaging in various sporting activities and keeping the body / mind constantly in high-energy zone, unlike the millennial who prefers an air- conditioned zumba room for their physical unwinding. Baiju is a government employee who still spends more time at their village playground than at his office, along with his bunch of (mid/late 20s) cronies who call themselves Kumbalam Brothers.\n\nWhat I liked genuinely about the Ranjan Pramod flick is its honest take on sports and physical activity as a whole. The playground harbors all kinds of sports, not just cricket. While Kumbalam Brothers are cricket enthusiasts, they still make room for young footballers and women badminton players too. The camaraderie between the youngsters and Baiju is a treat to watch. The humor is clean, situational and mostly chuckle-worthy. In the absence of a solid plot, the writer/director relies on the cast and the holistic positivity to sustain viewer attention. And for a film that runs close to 2h 45m they manage to pull off a successful feat, for most part. \n\nDeepak Parambol, Aju Varghese, Harish Perumana and a long list of supporting artists keep the movie afloat. Hannah Reji who plays Baiju&apos;s wife Ajitha, is perfect foil. The husband-wife conversations are humorously relatable; the soapy vibe that usually comes with poor handling of such characters thankfully doesn&apos;t take charge here. Some of the younger romances too are subtly dealt. Menon plays Baiju in his usual relaxed self, cracking one-liners with a deadpan expression that the viewers have cherished since a long while now. A few emotional moments are present in the latter half, although there is the severe lack of a &apos;major event&apos; that hints at a turning point/twist. Perhaps, it is this uneventful-ness that makes &apos;Rakshadhikari Baiju&apos; a jaunty, feel-good affair.\n\nBaiju tells the nerds sitting at a bus-shelter to stop staring at their books, and take a peek around once in a while, because they never know what they might be missing out on. There is absolutely no preachy tone adopted while trying to convey the message(s) which makes &apos;RD&apos; an uplifting experience overall. There are numerous sub- plots (like Manoj&apos;s and Unni&apos;s love-lives, Hari&apos;s cricketing quest which eventually leads him to the IPL, Baiju&apos;s sibling rivalry, his relationship with the kids of the block, there&apos;s plenty to write about!) and songs that take up a sizable amount of screen-time, yet &apos;RD&apos; never bores you. \n\nVerdict: Refreshing!",

The whole of it is in Arabic or Hebrew and it is all sub-titled. It is broken into seven chapters, of which the titles are things like &quot;I never would have believed I would walk next to a Jew.&quot;\n\nAt one point they take a tour of an Israeli museum with of course an Israeli host, speaking Hebrew, and I loved how the documentarist re-visited the tour with the Palestinian Arabs reflections on what they had seen and been told.\n\nThe most poignant part of the documentary to me was when this single Palestinian Arab whom had taken the tour, was able to see his Mother for the first time in years, and how they exchanged photographs by throwing them over the border between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nThat&apos;s right, his family (Mother &amp; siblings, Dad&apos;s dead by Israeli forces, I think) live in Lebanon, and since the West Bank where he lives does not border Lebanon, and because Lebanon will not let him into their country either, this bus tour of Israel was the only way for him to see his family.\n\n Anyway. For us Westerners, I more or less thought I knew the feelings that the Palestinians had, but it was very enlightening to me to see and hear the average Palestinian first hand. It hasn&apos;t changed any of my opinions of the mess in the Middle East, but it has given me a personal, new perspective.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Beyond the Time Barrier&quot; is the type of late 50s/early 60s Sci-Fi film of which you know, after approximately five minutes already, that it could have been a fantastic contemporary genre highlight if only the cast and crew didn&apos;t have to work with such a minimalist budget! Most of the conceptual ideas are really great and well- elaborated, but the cheap looking set pieces and the pitiable special effects have an immensely restraining impact on the overall plausibility and entertainment value. In case you serve an ambitious plot that is dealing with time-traveling and largely takes place in a futuristic dystopia, you can&apos;t afford to use paper made spaceships or drawings of the metropolis and you most certainly cannot speak of horribly deformed mutants the entire time without properly showing their faces! So, in an attempt to cover up for the budgetary weakness, Edgar G. Ulmer does what every experienced veteran director would do: replace the action sequences with endless intellectual speeches and complicated time warp theories as much as you can! In 1960, Major William Ellison has the honor and privilege to test-fly a brand new and hi-tech type of army fighter plane. The speed of the aircraft is even a little too successful, as Ellison breaks through the time barrier and ends up in the year 2024. It takes quite a while before our Major properly realizes that he fast- forwarded 64 years into the future, and the technical details are explained to him by three other scientists that went through the same experience. By the way, I didn&apos;t understand one iota about those time-traveling theories, but I also figure that incomprehensible speeches are a mandatory aspect of 50s Sci-Fi Ellison immediately gets confronted with the terrible state of our planet and civilization in the year 2024. Apparently an all- devastating kind of cosmic plague made the entire world population sterile (the last child was born more 20 years ago) and gradually transforms the remaining survivors into mutants. There&apos;s also good news, however, as the last fertile woman on earth is a beautiful princess and she has chosen him to re-populate the planet! She – Trirene – is a deaf-mute with telekinetic powers and she can read Ellison&apos;s thoughts, which results in at least one (unintentionally?) hilarious sequence: &quot;I know you can read my mind. Although right now I probably wished you couldn&apos;t&quot; and then he gets slapped in the face! Admittedly &quot;Beyond the Time Barrier&quot; principally got made to cash in on the tremendous success of H.G. Wells&apos; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and also borrows many elements from Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, but it&apos;s an engaging and occasionally suspenseful tale. I even like to think that some nifty ideas from this film were copied years later in massive Hollywood productions (for example the sterility in &quot;Children of Men&quot;), although I&apos;m probably mistaken.",

      "reviewBody": "The story begins in the tenements of New York, with two brothers, one an aspiring musician and the other a fighter, who already has a yen for a pretty young neighbor who is an aspiring dancer. Cut to some years later, and the boxer is James Cagney, the musician&apos;s Arthur Kennedy, and the young neighbor is Ann Sheridan. All three of them are on the way to making it in their chosen careers, but in doing so, Sheridan&apos;s character falls in love with a sleazy ballroom dancer (Anthony Quinn). Cagney makes it big in boxing in order to help fund his brother&apos;s music career, before tragedy brings the three back together.\n\nCagney is Cagney as ever, but Sheridan seems a little too genteel as his tenement-bred girl - although that&apos;s partly the point - and I kept wondering why they didn&apos;t pick a dancer for the part. Whenever they need a dance number, they either shoot it from the waist down or cut to a long shot. It&apos;s too bad WB didn&apos;t have Rita Hayworth under contract - she would have been ideal, and a much better fit than the role she was doing over at Columbia at that time, in Ben Hecht&apos;s Angels Over Broadway (1940). Arthur Kennedy as the musical brother doesn&apos;t make a huge impression, but it&apos;s interesting to see Elia Kazan in a small role.\n\nIt has great camerawork with a great sense of the late 30s. I didn&apos;t realize until afterwards that the great James Wong Howe had a hand in this, but it figures. It&apos;s one of those films that feels like it fell a little short of its lofty ambitions, but it&apos;s so handsome that I hardly cared.",

      "reviewBody": "For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am so glad to learn that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movie-going travails. Loosely based on the Shakesperean play, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes, in one of his best performances), bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (to real life spouse Gene Rowlads), who decides to chuck it all, say the hell with the rat race and go live on an island with his daughter (Molly Ringwald, in her film debut), and new girlfriend Aretha (a luminous Susan Sarandon). Even though Paul Mazursky is credited as director, Cassavettes hand is all over this film...the long scenes filmed without cutting, the improvisatory feel to the dialogue..., the self-indulgent storytelling style, this is definitely his show from beginning to end, and if you&apos;re not a fan of his work, the film will seem laboriously long and dull but if you are a fan, there are rewards to be had. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first rate cast...his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scene-stealing performance by the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos, Cassavettes&apos; manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing &quot;New York, New York&quot;. This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes, it&apos;s a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different (there&apos;s even a curtain call at the end of the film), but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing.",

Reviewing AMICI MIEI is like diving into a tub of champagne after just getting drunk, there are so many things that come back to your memory and make you smile that it would be enough to list them. But I won&apos;t do that, instead I will say something more significant for us Italians, this film (and its trilogy) is and will always be the best comedy film produced in Italy. Point! He expressed in the most true and realistic way a cross-section of the best way of experiencing friendship in the sixties/seventies, a true, sincere, inter-class friendship, I would dare say almost a brotherhood. There are truly irresistible, contagious points of irony, we would all have wanted or tried to make fun like Count Mascetti played by a splendid Ugo Tognazzi, or to pose like the prof. Sassaroli (Adolfo Celi), or why not to fall in love like the architect Melandri (Gastone Moschin), manage a bar like Perozzi (Duillio Del Prete and Renzo Montagnani) and go on &quot;escapades&quot; like Perozzi (Philippe Noiret). How beautiful, what a pleasure, how many memories... a cult film, an authentic inspiration for entire generations! Masterpiece by Mario Monicelli.",

He runs away, and eventually goes to the opera house where Signorina Tschechowa is to have her premiere as lead dancer. At first she simply takes care of him as any kind-hearted woman would do. But when she says her dancing is more important than he, Marietto runs away.\n\nNow here is the peculiar thing: Marietto -- and Signorina Tschechowa keep running into Vittorio De Sica. Sometimes he is a traffic cop. Sometimes he drives a taxi. But always, when he appears, Marietto gets a little closer to finding a mother and a father.\n\nI won&apos;t go so far as to say that any movie with De Sica in it is worth seeing. In when he could choose his own movies, sometimes a producer might offer him so much money he would find himself unable to say no. I will state that he brightens up any scene he appears in. Given the overwhelming sentimentality of this movie, I would not usually care for it, but director Antonio Leonviola, and his co-writer Mario Monicelli have produced a movie with a simple plot and given their characters lines which reflect that, and it works very well. Particularly when De Sica is around.",

      "reviewBody": "This Vijay Dinanath Chauhan is not interested in comparisons. All he wants is a fair chance to payback the killer Kancha (Sanjay Dutt), who remorselessly murdered his father Dinanath Chauhan, when Vijay was a kid. Gaon Mandwa, this is where Vijay was born and since the time he could remember, his father used to recite poems for him. Poems that would talk about path of fire.\n\nTo say that &quot;Agneepath&quot; is simply a technologically superior version of the original Vijay played by Amitabh Bachhan would be being unfair to the interesting spirals plugged into the story by Ila Dutta Bedi and Karan Malhotra. The most absorbing spiral is the drug dealer and pimp Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor), a character assayed so earnestly that in a few scenes Lala fills all the space offered by the movie. The cinematography by Kiran Deohans and Ravi K Chandra blends beautifully with the story as well as the costumes and explanation of the characters; but tries too hard to add an epic feeling to the climax, which spoils the sympathy for the rendition by overstuffing it with filmy shibboleths. \n\nThe passionate craving for penalizing Kancha separated a 12-year-old Vijay (Hrithik Roshan) from his mother Suhasini (Zarina Wahab) and his newly born sister and found a medium in Lala. Roshan&apos;s adaptation of the cult character has a calmness in his deep-rooted anger, a silence in his hatred and a fire in his eyes - all of which combine to a mighty performance. Thankfully, the burdensome task Arish Bhiwandiwala has left for Roshan with his sharp illustration of the character of the young Vijay Chauhan, has been done justice to. Hrithik&apos;s description could have been unexampled had the dialogues by Piyush Mishra been weighty enough and the editing by Akiv Ali wiser. \n\nThe screenplay and the editing, following the traditions of Bollywood, has reduced Kaali Gawde (Priyanka Chopra) to a beautiful piece of furniture, the only difference being that this one dances. Pity. While the director Karan Malhotra tries hard to make a thunderous appeal to the audience with the electrifying decibels between Vijay and Kancha, an unaware Lala steals the thunder from the two for the larger part of the movie. Sanjay Dutt as Kancha is a solid institution of wickedness in a way that hating Kancha would make someone feel better about himself/herself as a human being. Lala, with his unashamed spontaneity, is few notches higher though in my opinion.\n\nA film crowded with powerful performers leaves little inspiration for Indian directors to focus too much on the story. With responsible editing and lesser concentration on dressing, &quot;Agneepath&quot; could easily have been 45 minutes shorter and more compelling. The movie reveals a certain degree of naivety in the direction. There is an immaturity in the way the clichés lifted from the 1980&apos;s and the brother-sister angle have been treated. \n\nVijay Chauhan&apos;s disinterest in Chikni Chameli is understandable; what is worrying is that a movie from Dharma Productions behaves so poorly in the music department. Ajay-Atul must have good reasons behind the heavy-duty background music and the pointless songs of &quot;Agneepath&quot;. Chikni Chameli is long forgiven.\n\nMind you, don&apos;t practice comparing while watching &quot;Agneepath&quot;, even if you are an ardent fan of either of the Vijays. Life would be simpler.",

      "name": "Very funny Stephen Chow film, easily one of his best",
      "reviewBody": "Released in 1994, Love On Delivery (aka King Of Destruction) is a Hong Kong comedy starring Stephen Chow as a naive delivery boy who tries to impress a girl by learning martial arts from a wise master, who may not exactly be the all-knowing badass he claims to be.\n\nChristy Chung plays Lily, a Judo student whose teacher (Joe Cheng) keeps hitting on her. This prompts her to kiss a stranger to get him off her back. The stranger in question is candid delivery boy Ang Ho-Kam (Stephen Chow) who suddenly finds himself falling in love with her. The problem is he just doesn&apos;t cut it when it comes to holding his own. After struggling to purchase Jacky Cheung concert tickets to take Lily out on a date (Cheung cameos in the film), he fails to defend her against the Judo master making advances so she breaks it off with Ang, calling him a coward. Defeated, Ang meets a shop owner called Tat (Ng Man Tat) who claims to be a martial arts expert and is willing to teach him, for a price. The price turns out to be all of Ang&apos;s money since Tat proves to be a very obvious conman. Can Ang learn... anything about self-defense before Lily gives up on him entirely?\n\nOne of Stephen Chow&apos;s earliest comedies as (co-)director, Love On Delivery marked his second collaboration with long-time partner-in-crime Lee Lik-chi and its quick pacing in terms of jokes helped establish a new wave of slapstick spoof comedies in the vein of the 70&apos;s Michael Hui classics, but with a more modern edge. Chow&apos;s trademark style of comedy is very much in full force here, as is his deadpan demeanor. The visual gags get goofier and goofier as the movie goes on and every character is sillier than the next, with the likes of The Terminator, Rocky and Kamen Rider getting spoofed along the way. Tat&apos;s effortless scamming of Ang is the highlight of the film as it leads to some truly hilarious confrontations including Ang&apos;s discovery of the Fire Spin move which consists of simply grabbing someone then falling down a flight of stairs with them.\n\nAbout halfway through, the film sees Ang sport a Garfield mask and fight his nemesis, the mean Judo teacher, but the real challenge he has to face is a professional fighter played by Ben Lam who challenges him to a big match after wooing Lily. The fight in question is, of course, a complete farce (think Charlie Chaplin&apos;s boxing short film) and provides lots of laughs. This is easily one of Chow&apos;s funniest movies and it holds up surprisingly well. Some of his more well known works feel a little overrated at times but Love On Delivery delivers (pun intended) in the most important department: the jokes themselves. One would&apos;ve liked for Christy Chung to do a little bit more in the second half of the film, since her character was meant to know martial arts as well, but other than that the film makes the most of its fun, energetic cast.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking to discover the works of Stephen Chow and Lee Lik-chi, then the brilliantly anarchic Love On Delivery is not a bad place to start. It&apos;s refreshingly not as gross-out as some of Chow&apos;s other films, and the slapstick is supported by a genuinely very funny script, which is not always the case.\n\nA good time.",

Surely Jimmy Perry and David Croft must have drawn on him when they were dreaming up the Capt Mainwaring character for the long-running BBC TV sit-com &quot;Dad&apos;s Army&quot;. Even one of Waggett&apos;s lines (&quot;I was waiting to see when you&apos;d spot that&quot;, a comment usually made when Mainwaring had just uttered some piece of logistical nonsense) made an appearance.

      "reviewBody": "John Carpenter wrote the story for this stylish exciting action film from 1986, although the film seems to have a rather low budget, must be because it was made through Roger Corman&apos;s old company, New World Pictures. In any rate, Tommy Lee Jones is great in one of his most exciting roles, before he became a major star. Jones plays Quint a man who steals from the government. He steals a certain disc and hides it in a 21st century car built by a former NASA agent. However, the problem is, he is being tracked by government agent Johnson (Bubba Smith) who relies on his famous line &quot;don&apos;t **** with the government!&quot;, which I truly enjoyed. Quint also falls in love with a young woman named Nina (Linda Hamilton) who just so happened to steal the car that has the discs in it. It becomes a fun filled, action packed chase in the end, and the action scenes in the LA skyrise buildings are awesome. The supportive cast is topped off by Robert Vaughn, playing his usual villian role, while Richard Jaeckel, Lee Ving, William Sandersen, Nick Cassavettes and Keenan Wynn occasionally steal the scene. Black Moon Rising is a fun filled little action film, which I liked."

      "reviewBody": "Jackass 3D is the latest from the group and as the title suggests, it&apos;s in 3D. Stunning 3D if I dare say so. No matter how old I get I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever get tired of watching these brave men launch various objects at their genitalia and ignite a wide variety of explosives while standing far too close for comfort.\n\nI&apos;m sure most of you have seen the trailer so I don&apos;t have to go into the stunts and pranks performed in the film, but what I will talk about is how amazing the film looks. 3D has been reserved for large scale action films and animated features. Here is essentially a documentary being shot in 3D, the first of its kind (though Werner Herzog&apos;s upcoming documentary Caves utilizes 3D technology as well).\n\nThe compositions on screen are so bizarre yet so simple. They make the most immature acts a work of art. Rather than finding out the harmful effects of being stunned by a stun gun or cattle prod, they turn it into an event whereby several members of the group run through a hallways with various types of these devices hanging in the air.\n\nThese daredevils or &quot;trained professionals,&quot; as they disclaim in opening credits, have gone from punk rebels to cultural icons. Their outlandish pranks and inconceivable stunts are a testament to our society&apos;s consumption of the obscene and the absurd. We watch these hooligans abuse themselves for our enjoyment. We laugh at their pain. The only reason we laugh is because we aren&apos;t the ones feeling their pain.\n\nWhat really makes this film funny is the groups approach to their work. I can imagine how many takes of each segment introduction their must be. The men are either dying from laughter at what is about to unfold, or they can hardly keep their composure for fear that this next stunt will be their last. Regardless, we get a sense that what we are seeing on camera is what these people are really like. They laugh, scream, and gasp for air like we would, though perhaps with a little more courage.\n\nThis carefree approach comes through in the production as well. The melding of the crew with the cast is like watching a dysfunctional family&apos;s home videos. The cameras capture the action both with the cast and behind the scenes with the crew. It&apos;s a fun, slightly off atmosphere. To help create this atmosphere, we are fortunate enough to listen to a great selection of songs, my favorite being Roger Miller&apos;s &quot;You Can&apos;t Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd,&quot; played over Johnny Knoxville being chased after by a herd of buffalo. Oh yeah, he&apos;s also wearing roller skates. How fitting.\n\nI don&apos;t think I need to tell you all this, but this film isn&apos;t for everyone. I can think of several scenes which some will find offensive, others will find revolting, and maybe a few of you will deem as unfit for human eyes. Still, those who are fans of the show or if you&apos;re looking for something new, look no further. This film is a raunchy, laugh riot.",

I haven&apos;t seen this movie anywhere to rent for a long time, and then one day I saw it for sale for a few bucks in some discount bin in a video store.  I&apos;d figured I&apos;d pick it up and see what I had missed since my original viewing. I watched it and was not sure what to think about it.  First off I hated Sondra Locke.  She was not funny, very annoying and had the worst outfits I have ever seen on a woman. The box of this movie promotes it as a comedy.  Well I didn&apos;t really think that this rating was appropriate, since the only time I laughed was when the actors tried to act.  Ratboy has no emotion (which was what the movie was trying to promote),  and whenever he talked I couldn&apos;t understand what he was saying.    Some of the supporting characters were alright, I enjoyed Nipsy Russell and Robert Townshend, and Gerritt Graham and Louie Anderson were okay, I also enjoyed seeing cameos from Bill Maher, John Lovitz and &quot;Diz&quot; from the TV show Out of Control.  Other than that I feel that this movie should have never been made.  But I cant change the past, so if your in the mood for a boring &quot;comedy&quot;, and if you can find this movie anywhere, maybe you should check it out, but I don&apos;t recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Yesterday, I saw this film. I didn&apos;t know anything about it before and was surprised how light-hearted and charming it is, just like the comic books from Ralf König, a famous German comic author. Unlike other films based on Ralf König&apos;s comics (Der bewegte Mann, Kondom des Grauens), this film transports all the spirit you feel when reading the comics. I laughed from the first minute to the last. The humour is partly subtle and partly very obvious. The film sure has a layer that can only be understood by a German gay man but is nevertheless thrilling to watch for everybody.\n\nIt is for sure one of the best German comedies I saw for a long time.\n\nMrs Schneider gives an outstanding performance as a Russian Opera Diva, including her famous &quot;Bulgarian&quot; accent - so be sure to see the original version in German.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a funny thing that in this day and age of internet society through which it was able to take root and grow, the first I ever heard of &quot;Broken Saints&quot; was by old fashioned window shopping. This alone, I think, means that I have missed out on a gigantic part of what made the series so enticing to many; not only that it was completely free but that it stood as a testament to the Internet&apos;s fulfilled promise of a global community and prosperous mass medium for independent artists. This was not the first internet series I have purchased on DVD; Rooster Teeth&apos;s &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, an online Machinema production created by independent Texan film-makers, remains one of the most delightful discoveries of my life. However, &quot;Broken Saints&quot; is the first independent internet project I have bought entirely on spec, and this goes towards proving that there is more to the series&apos; appeal than its initial medium.\n\nBrooke Burgess&apos; flash creation is one of the most unique works of art I have ever encountered. Consisting of 24 episodes of increasing length (beginning at 10 minutes and eventually running for over an hour), the series uses a fusion of comic narration, flash animation, music and, in the case of the remastered DVD version, voice acting to propel its story, the premise for which is inherently twisted. As the slow reveal is a major part of the series&apos; deep intrigue, I will try to reveal nothing further than might be read in a blurb: On the unsuspecting cusp of a new technological age, four complete and diverse strangers begin to simultaneously receive violent spiritual turbulences; seizures, visions, crises of faith, inexplicable emotions. Strange, disturbing events in each of their lives drive them desperate for answers, and the harder they search for absolution, the closer they come to each other and the higher the stakes climb.\n\nNow what I am about to say is something that really confused me at first: as a story, I didn&apos;t like &quot;Broken Saints&quot; all that much. It uses a very David Lynch style kind of linear narration (borderline nonsensical), and although all the vague poetry and metaphors are probably all made clear in the end, this happens in an overly preachy and bombastic sort of way. As a fierce atheist, I actually quite like bold agnosticism in a film, which is probably why I cared enough for the plot to see it through to the end (uncertainty of a higher being is held brilliantly throughout most of the series). But by the end I couldn&apos;t help but feel that the collective twelve hours I had spent watching the series had been a ploy to impose some kind of Faith on me. Hey, maybe I&apos;m just interpreting the whole thing in a defensive way.\n\nBut what drove me to nonetheless give this series full marks and resolve to watch the whole thing again is really a deep respect for the creators: Brooke Burgess, Andrew West and Ian Kirby. These guys may hold a slightly different opinion to me on a spiritual level (I happened to agree with their politics, though), but they sure know how to argue their point. The sensory impact of &quot;Broken Saints&quot; is quite remarkable; the artwork and music cues (by Tobias Tinker, check him out on Myspace) are some of the most haunting and beautiful I have seen. The genius of this is that it keeps you interested long enough for other things to grab hold; empathy for the characters, intrigue into story development, and all that.\n\nThis is why, eventually, you never really hold much against a series like this. &quot;Broken Saints&quot; is a pretty broad web of appeal; if it loses your interest in one regard, it will catch it somewhere else. You don&apos;t like the alien culture of Shandala&apos;s Fijian islands and Oran&apos;s Saudi Arabian deserts then maybe Raimi&apos;s dark, post-modern America and filthy mouth will make you feel more at home. You don&apos;t like the preachy, new age gospel of the believers, then maybe you&apos;ll buy the more understated search for purpose; not necessarily God, just purpose. You don&apos;t like the politics, then just enjoy the art. You don&apos;t love the art, then respect the history of the project. In the end, whether you&apos;ve been converted to a higher perception of life or just entertained for a few empty nights, the closing credits of &quot;Broken Saints&quot; will see you, however subconsciously, respecting one of the most finely argued contentions of artistic creation the world has ever seen. Word is Bond ;).",

      "reviewBody": "Oshima&apos;s first film in 14 years after illness was apparently directed from a wheel chair, and it&apos;s tempting to locate some of its static, formal qualities in the personal restrictions faced by the director. But this cool, intense, and very Japanese piece is stylistically rooted in the country&apos;s cinematic past, while at the same time offering provocative work familiar characteristic of this director. In his most famous film, Realm Of The Senses (aka: Ai No Corrida), made 25 years ago, dangerous sexual activity was explicit. In Gohatto (trans: Taboo), things are far less in the open. The expression of sex has been replaced with its obsession although, for Oshima, the irrationality of arousal still remains anti-authoritarian, as it creates impulses that are hard to resist. \n\nFor those more used to the straight samurai of old, Oshima&apos;s suggestions of cuddles beneath the kimono is a surprise (more outrage was generated in Japan, where it was felt more strongly that such suggestions ran against a proud tradition). One can never imagine stouthearted Toshiro Mifune, the most famous cinematic samurai from the previous generation, falling for another soldier and interrupting his role in Seven Samurai for a romp in the dojo. Cult actor/director &apos;Beat&apos; Takeshi, here playing Captain Toshizo Hijikata, seems at first sight an odd choice for this sort of drama too, until one remembers the gay gunman he played so convincingly in Takashi Ishii&apos;s Gonin (1995). With his impassive face he reduces introspection to the reoccurring flicker of his (real life) tic, which, most aptly here, can suggest everything and nothing. Hijikata&apos;s internal narrative, first quizzical about Sozabura&apos;s lovers then perturbed about his effect on the garrison, suggests growing doubts resolved only in the final, memorable scene. \n\nIn Gohatto, much of the interest of the film lays in the degree in which Sozaburo&apos;s beauty arouses the interest of the men around him. Some are openly attracted to him (notably Tashiro, who shortly attempts to climb into the bed with him). Others are on the edge, like Inspector Yamazaki, charged with taking him to the brothel in Shimabara to introduce the youth to women. Most are affected in one way or another; most enigmatically are Hojikata and his superior and close colleague Commander Kondo (Yoichi Sai). As Hojikata observes, &quot;a samurai can be undone by a love of men.&quot; But then he wonders too &quot;Why are we both so indulgent with Sozabura?&quot; and Kondo&apos;s rectitude and conspicuous silence hides, we suspect, a greater interest in the youth than he might wish to admit. \n\nOshima&apos;s visual scheme creates a film full of the bare, dark wood interiors of the militia base and the mud brown of uniforms, where just a few significant colours stand out. During the early beheading of the renegade samurai by Sozabuta, it is the red splash of the executed man&apos;s blood. At other times, Sozabuta wears a unique white robe (the Japanese colour of death). His is a presence and beauty shortly associated with a form of annihilation. In a place full of military men, that we see this feminine youth kill most often is no surprise. Compared to his contemporaries, he is the most adept at the sword unless fazed by romantic entanglements. It&apos;s an obvious irony that the object of homosexual affection is also the most deadly of the men; there&apos;s more in the fact that a group of iron-hearted soldiers can be so easily divided by an &apos;enemy&apos; within, one neither fierce nor commanding. \n\nThere&apos;s another mystery in Gohatto, besides who exactly is sleeping with Sozabuta and who wants to. It&apos;s who is the murderer of Yuzawa (Tomorowo Taguchi), and doubts as to the truth of the case persist. This, and the attempt to apprehend the intruders at the base (&quot;they call these samurai?&quot;) provide the main impetus of the plot. Like so many great Japanese films of the past, Oshima&apos;s says a lot in restraint. Here the arrangement of seated figures within the frame can suggest unspoken tensions, order is paramount, and the use of the camera is elegant and discreet. Some see the resulting style dull, when it is a slower, more contemplative way of seeing the world, one where not every question is answered. \n\nWhat exactly is &apos;taboo&apos; in Gohatto is clearly the issue of homosexuality - although confusingly for Western audiences such matters are not explicitly forbidden. Reference is made to the military code, which hangs on the barrack walls. Extracts appear on screen too, but no mention is made of prohibiting gay relations between soldiers. A man may be beheaded for illicitly borrowing money, but sleeping with his comrades at arms, while gossip worthy, is only really of concern when discipline is threatened. There &quot;no secrets on Heaven and Earth (and) everyone knows it,&quot; says one of the intertitles, and Hojikata himself refers to the &quot;tacit understanding&quot; which normally keeps things in check. A policy which roughly equates to the modern American army&apos;s own &quot;Don&apos;t ask, don&apos;t tell.&quot; \n\nThe film is helped immensely by Ryuichi Sakamoto&apos;s incessant, metronomic score, the steady beat of which considerably amplifies the obsessions and drawn out tensions of events. Like Oshima&apos;s interiors, it is uncluttered music, the muted colours dashed with an occasional significant tone. Now and again, urgency and violence break into this world: the initial beheading scene, the murderer&apos;s attacks, or the sword battle by the river. As a package, the result readily deserves art house admirers - especially as the director saves the best scene for last, expressing both Hojikata&apos;s final position, and a main thread of Gohatto, with hardly a cut more than necessary. Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "These days most everything is inherently cinematic: poetry, music, literature.\n\nThat&apos;s a good thing if you understand how cinema works and can escape its control when needed. One technique is to retreat to non-cinematic art, to surf the various pathways therein and then come back to the moving image from the outside.\n\nThis film, if you can find the five hour version, can provide one such exercise. Dylan builds his songs around images, but they are not images from film or film-influenced phrases. His images are what appears in dreams, originating in real life and sliced and diced by drugs. (Incidentally, the period of this film marks the transition from active tripping of various kinds to passive by his &quot;acceptance&quot; of fundamentalism another drug.)\n\nHis method has always been to eschew a plan, to avoid premeditated structure, to abandon great themes. Instead, he just starts, waits for images and ideas to appear and then arranges them on the table. His art is a combination of selection and composition. The selection is a matter of discarding everything that seems to be simple. That automatically puts him in the world of the Tambourine Man, where he has been in various guises for decades.\n\nThe matter of composition is something else. He just trusts how they appear. Since they all come from one mind, and that mind is coherent and somewhat interesting, they hang together. He doesn&apos;t know how they do and has given up questioning, except for a brief period of examining Kabbalah.\n\nThat&apos;s how he does it with his music, and it works to judge from his audience. He also does it with his prose rambles. This works less well; the act of juxtaposing elements in his songs leverages the vocabulary of rhythmic associations he pretty much invented. But he has no equivalent to serve his writing projects, so most of them come across as sophomoric. Same with this film.\n\nHe just started. But images in film (at least films like this) have to come from things that are presented in the real world. He relies on some friends to help create and select the images/ scenes/sequences. Ginsberg is an anchor who does understand the rhythms of poetry where Bob does not, but he is as ignorant as Bob concerning film.\n\nAnother friend is Sam Shepard who is credited as co-writer. During this time, he was working with Terence Malick on another project which is about the same problem of selection. Shepard and Malick for that matter have a coherent theory of &quot;selection&quot; that they can use in conceiving their projects and setting the basic tone. We can see much of that here; it all relates to folding of persons into characters that are assignable to other bodies. Thus we have many &quot;actors&quot; playing more than one role; roles that are assigned to more than one actor; scenes that are copied from real life; lives that are generated from scenes (bordello vignettes, Indian cosmologies, Black injustices, beat poems...)\n\nThat&apos;s the selection half and it is interesting as all getout. The composition half is pure dreck. Dylan trusts his intuitions as he always does. But these pieces don&apos;t all come from the inner spinning of a whole mind like Kieslowski&apos;s or Tarkovsky&apos;s. They come from all over and he stitches them together as if they did actually come from his visions. But they didn&apos;t so it has no coherent being.\n\nHe tries to use songs, his and others, as glue. Some of these are enjoyable by themselves but they sure don&apos;t help assemble a cinematic being.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
