      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s an oddity. It&apos;s a werewolf movie which operates as a comedy about a Whitehouse press secretary who is bitten by a lycanthrope while stationed in Hungary. He is recalled to Washington and winds up killing a bunch of people connected to the President. This came out during the Watergate scandal and the main character does stay in that famous hotel but I think it would be a stretch to push this one too far as a satire, as the material is a bit thin for that; after all, one of the best gags has our hero getting his fingers jammed in a ball while bowling pre-full moon. Its still kind of hard to dislike though, and I am always a sucker for werewolf make-up. The transformation scenes were actually not bad and Dean Stockwell is pretty committed in the main role - he looked wired to be perfectly honest. Overall, a fun 90 mins for werewolf fans.",

There is a lot of poetry and tenderness.\n\nIn the original version, the main characters are interpreted by Matthieu Chedid (better known under the pseudonym -M-), François Cluzet, the delicious and well-known Vanessa Paradis. The songs are beautifully interpreted with two versions of &apos;La Seine&apos;. The first one is without -M-, with slight and voluntary low spirits. The second one, with -M-: this time Vanessa Paradis offers us an interpretation full of vitality and charm!\n\nAs a synthesis: a major cartoon for all the family. 6/7 of 10"

      "reviewBody": "What we have here is half of what might have been a good movie about swashbuckling and courtly intrigue. Cagliostro is a late 1920s silent production made in German–French co-production and considered lost until a copy turned up in the French film archives. Unfortunately, this is an edit of the two-hour original, and even with a few other fragments, it only comes at 58 minutes, losing multiple supporting characters and sub-plots, and leaving much of the plot development to title cards.\n\nAnd this is a shame, because the remaining footage gives us a fun story that&apos;s half historical drama (based on real events, no less) and half swashbuckling adventure. Cagliostro, an Italian adventurer played by the almost unnaturally handsome Hans Stüwe, rises through the French aristocracy on account of his magical tricks, medical knowledge and ability to foretell the future. When he falls from favour after a divination that predicts a dire future for Marie Antoinette, he sets in motion a plan that will result in revenge, but at a great price.\n\nThis is very much a movie that features beautiful people plotting against each other among sumptuous and grandiose interior sets. The tone is extremely amoral, and both Cagliostro and his opponents come across as tremendous scumbags. The film features some very explicit sexual content for its age, but alas, the swordplay featured on the original advertisements has almost all been cut. Likewise, the final act is over in pretty much 10 minutes; it may have been a larger segment in the original.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this is Cagliostro as we have it now: some good acting, interesting expressionist touches, hints of something that may have been a grand plot, lots of wigs, but not a full movie, and probably not something someone looking for a great film experience should buy until a more complete version turns up.",

      "reviewBody": "I last saw this film in 1963 on &quot;Chiller,&quot; a locally produced TV show out of Minneapolis which showcased B horror movies every Sunday night. For years my friends and I would toss around the line, &quot;I can grow a new claw--can you grow a new life?&quot; I recently purchased a copy on the Internet and had a chance to watch it again. Except for the conventional bumbling around that characters in this kind of movie do (wandering in the dark in the middle of the night; responding to amplified voices as they lie in their beds in fear; going alone through caves where there is only one exit and the crabs are definitely around) this is pretty entertaining. I&apos;m not sure whether these crabs have world domination in mind (revenge for those little forks and drawn butter) or just want to rid the island of humans. They do a real number on the eco-system. Will they have any beaches left to go to. Will they eventually go back to being &quot;just crabs&quot; or will they take their ventriloquist act on the road? We really don&apos;t know.\n\nI think the strength of the movie is the cool, oppressive atmosphere and threat posed by the enterprising crustaceans. A weakness is that there is no explanation of their fine motor skills. They seemingly knock down everything in their paths in their lumbering way, but are still able to destroy just the right parts to dismantle a radio and are able to blow up a plane. If you don&apos;t do too much criticizing or thinking, you will enjoy this early Roger Corman gem.",

There is not a gun fired, not a drop of gore shed but the final effect of the film will stay with you for a good while. More contemporary film viewers might recognize the concept from John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;The Thing&quot; which itself was an update of the 1951 film. However, the themes of paranoia and tension are just as nail-biting and intense here.\n\nThere is a lack of visual punch that so many people are used to today, but just think of the historical context and the implications, basically use your mind! Then you&apos;ll see why the film scared studio executives so much that they forced Don Siegel to add an intro and outro to help soften the overall effect. It wasn&apos;t the best play in the book, but the film remains a great classic chiller. --- 9/10\n\nNot Rated. It would most likely receive a PG from the MPAA, there are several tense moments, though no violence.",

It touches sensitively on subjects that by many can be considered wrong to talk about and presents them in the nicest way without diverting from the history. The political turmoil as well as the relationships of people living in Polis (Istanbul) are highlighted and the key figures although play minor role in the events that happen around them still steal the interest by presenting how simple yet &quot;rich&quot; in taste their life was. Coming from a family that was as well deported (using a modest word here for what really happened) from home lands, the movie touched me in so many ways. I think it deserves a 10/10 and is highly recommended.. not only for the Greeks that can relate to the story but for anyone who can appreciate a good story.",

      "reviewBody": "Back in the 60s and early 70s, the Rankin-Bass company made some of the best and most iconic Christmas specials ever, such as &quot;Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot;. If these films are the only Rankin-Bass films you&apos;ve seen, then films like &quot;Willy McBean and His Magic Machine&quot; will come as a surprise for several reasons. First, the company didn&apos;t just make Christmas or other holiday specials. Second, the quality of their productions varied tremendously...and some, like this film, look a tad shabby by comparison. I am not completely sure why, but it may be because the Rankin-Bass folks farmed the animation out to studios in Japan...and which Japanese company made them changed several times. All I know is that this feature-length movie just isn&apos;t the same quality of the great Christmas shows. Now I am not saying it&apos;s bad...but it certainly isn&apos;t great.\n\nThe story begins with the evil Professor Von Rotten building a time machine and planning to go back in history to make himself one of the most important figures ever. But his monkey, Pablo, steals the blueprints and brings them to Willy McBean, who is sort of like a Dexter or Jimmy Neutron...a brilliant kid with super-special scientific skills. So Willy makes his own time machine and takes Pablo with him through history to stop the wicked Professor!\n\nOn the plus side, one or two of the songs are catchy...one in particularly got stuck in my head. And, I am sure it took a lot of work to create this stop-motion film...I do appreciate that. But the story and characters are pretty forgettable and I have a hard time imagining kids today sitting through this film. Interesting for nostalgia sake but otherwise a film that is, at best, a time-passer. If you are curious, it&apos;s currently posted on YouTube....along with several other Rankin-Bass full-length films and specials you probably never saw before or have long forgotten.",

      "reviewBody": "Technically speaking, I have seen this Fritz Lang silent sci-fi before, but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images, the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis, I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable, apocalyptic fantasy, and religious allegory. It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers, who toil in the depths tending the machines, and the upper classes, who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero, the idle, pampered son of the city&apos;s supervisor Joh Fredersen, changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria, the Madonna of the workers. His father, meanwhile, is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang, who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didn&apos;t see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film, the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version. With these changes, the story becomes much clearer, particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis. Perhaps most importantly, a whole new subplot is added involving the hero&apos;s dead mother Hel, who was loved by both his father and Rotwang. With this clarification of the back-story, the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer. In some ways it recalls the family back-story of the Star Wars movies. Of course, the real strength of Metropolis isn&apos;t the story, which is pretty silly and probably wouldn&apos;t have worked in anything but a silent film, but its amazing visuals, which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually, though in most respects silent films now look primitive, one area in which they have the edge over modern film-making is in their frequently grandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city&apos;s towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film. Even beyond the expansive production design and (for the time) special effects, Lang&apos;s visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Maria provides some of the movie&apos;s most iconic images, including her transformation into a human being. In a later scene, she performs for upper-class men in a nightclub, and as she performs a striptease that in 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent, the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang&apos;s visual lavishness, and the studio&apos;s, that he doesn&apos;t hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a character&apos;s state of mind. For instance, when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines, he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol&apos;s head into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point, while he&apos;s sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers, she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. labor parable, and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower&apos;s construction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and over-literal, but they&apos;re what silent cinema does best -tell a story without the advantage- or obstacle- of dialogue. The story is a little slow to start, but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I&apos;ve seen. In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines, endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years.",

      "reviewBody": "For those very few of you who have seen &quot;Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis&quot; (or the more renowned anime version &quot;Doomed Megalopolis&quot;) and enjoyed it, you might be interested in seeking out this continuation of the story. Apparently IMDb got things mixed up here, and they&apos;re displaying the &quot;Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis&quot; cover in the section for &quot;Teito Taisen&quot; (&quot;Tokyo: The Last War&quot;), which is the official sequel to the aforementioned movie. Somebody needs to fix this quick! Right now, I&apos;m reviewing &quot;Tokyo: The Last War&quot;, not &quot;Last Megalopolis&quot;. \n\nAlright, I admit that this film has not been subtitled, and I don&apos;t understand Japanese. So how do I know what&apos;s going on in here? Repeated viewings and lots of translated summaries. However, even if you don&apos;t know Japanese, this film has just enough action and scenery to make it worthwhile.\n\nThe story starts out at the end of World War II. Tokyo lies in ruins due to repeated fire-bombings from the American army. However, one surviving magic-user brings together a new group of mystics. His plan is to &quot;turn defeat into victory&quot; by using spiritual psychic powers to assassinate the evil world leaders from a distance (I know Hitler&apos;s involved). Unfortunately, the surge of spiritual energy along with the repeated horror of all those who endured the nightmare of the fire-bombings, rouses up all the souls of the dead, whose resentment and anger come together and revive...Yasunori Kato. Now it&apos;s up to a young apprentice of the psychic magic user to stop Kato before the evil sorcerer ruins their plans for victory. Kato also seems intent on torturing and gaining revenge on Yukiko (his &quot;daughter&quot; from the previous story), whose all grown-up now and works as a nurse in a hospital.\n\nIt should be noted that this is the only film that I&apos;ve seen that Takagise Ichise (the producer of &quot;Ringu&quot;, &quot;Ju-On&quot;, and &quot;Dark Water&quot;) directed, and it definitely shows in the style. &quot;Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis&quot; was going for an exotic fantasy atmosphere, while this movie aims to be more of a dark and gory horror movie. The silly creatures that Kato summoned in the original film have been completely dumped here. The only magic he really uses in this movie is throwing stuff around with psychic energy like Darth Vader. He even acts differently, coming off more like a slow-moving and leering &quot;Terminator&quot; rather than the more dynamic way he was portrayed in the original. Strangely enough, the sets aren&apos;t as varied as they were in &quot;Last Megalopolis&quot; either. Everything&apos;s dark and brooding, putting a greater emphasis on the grim historical setting. The beginning of the film felt like a docudrama or just some historical war movie. It&apos;s not until Kato arrives that the film begins to explore it&apos;s fantasy roots more.\n\nI liked this movie. The story is easily more comprehensible than its predecessors, the characters are better defined, and the production just feels more taut this time around. But I can only enjoy it as a standalone production. When viewed as a sequel to &quot;Last Megalopolis&quot;, it&apos;s an incredible disappointment. &quot;Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis&quot; was a very unique production in that it was a genre bender of a film: an epic that was equal parts fantasy, horror and historical fiction. This film feels more like some commercial horror film in a historical setting. It didn&apos;t even try to follow up the promises of its predecessor (for example, many plot threads left hanging at the end of that film are not resolved here). From an entertainment perspective, it&apos;s decent, but not in the same way.\n\nTwo years later, Rintaro would take the story of &quot;Last Megalopolis&quot; and the dark atmosphere of this film and make the anime &quot;Doomed Megalopolis&quot;. Ironically, since the atmosphere between the latter production and &quot;Last War&quot; is more consistent, &quot;Last War&quot; serves as a better sequel to the anime than &quot;Last Megalopolis&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "Beautiful Girls, notwithstanding its stellar cast, is a cerebral and multi-layered film which represents the emasculation of emotional and experiential films, which are often (and rightfully) vilified, or what might be called &quot;chick flicks&quot;. To this end, Beautiful Girls is a veritable &quot;guy flick&quot; and addresses to a more emotional end, some of the same 20-something angst and existentialist related issues faced by men as seen in more obvious (and violent) examples such as Fight Club. This film is a richly textured character story, profiling one man&apos;s quest for self understanding and direction by returning to his banal hometown from the big city while at a crossroad in his personal life, and while entering a new epoch in his relationship with an equally banal woman. His amalgam of high school friends remain isolated, almost indentured, to the same working class routine which defined their adolescence, and have little hope of ever moving on, other than in their idle daydreams. His subsequent obsession with the barely pubescent girl next door, Marty,(Portman) is in fact somewhat reminiscent of the dialectic of beauty and decay explored in Thomas Mann&apos;s epic &quot;Death in Venice&quot; whereas her youth and perceived way of interpreting the world is enviable, almost infectious. She represents less of a sexual or romantic fixture in his mind than she does a crucible for all things he values and hopes for. And still hopes to be. This film is not for everybody, and some less patient, or intelligent, viewers will no doubt decry it as boring or slow. Indeed the storyline is far from cutting edge, but the real story in this film is the people, the place, and the raw emotion which we can all relate with. This film is an impressionist painting come to life and is perfect philosophical fodder for the introspective type.",

The fact remains is that D.E.B.S., both low-budget and low-key, was far more enjoyable than any major blockbuster or highly acclaimed movie I&apos;ve seen in a while. Honestly, there are no major aspirations in this film and audiences should discard any major expectations too. Essentially, this is a movie that relies on a concept that has long been drained out of film-making - fun. The story itself, though weak in true substance, is hilarious and satirical. The characters are each interesting and worthy of further elaboration. Inevitably, the lesbian love story will always be the central point of D.E.B.S.&apos;s popularity but somehow, it deserves to be. The romance between the hero and the villain, a concept that&apos;s a parody in itself, is especially charming.\n\nSo forget all your movie snobbery and just watch the damn movie. It&apos;s a beautiful way to spend 90 minutes.",

      "reviewBody": "I agree with the other comments on the following points: the film does indeed concentrate on the culprits and their actions in a documentary way (as opposed to an interpretation of the RAF&apos;s ideas and motivations from a clear-cut political standpoint). Although the victims DO appear they are not characterized more closely; the only representative of the state is Horst Herold (head of the BKA), politicians do not show up at all, the media appear only in the shape of Springer, konkret and Spiegel and even the lawyers (Haag, Croissant, Schily, Ströbele, etc.) are merged into only one (fictitious?) character. I for one do agree with this approach and if you are prepared for it you probably can live with it too. In any case, despite all the chases, shootouts and explosions it hasn&apos;t become a mere action-film. \n\nWhat&apos;s more problematic is that the film follows the book by Stefan Aust VERY closely. Therefore the dramaturgy is more similar to &quot;real life&quot; than to a classical feature film (e.g. there are many changes in pace, several climaxes are distributed over the course of the film and a proper arc of suspense is somewhat missing). &quot;Fortunately&quot; real life offered a culmination of events with the Schleyer kidnapping in the &quot;German Autumn&quot; 1977, so that the film ends in a reasonably satisfying way. Nevertheless the end credits come a little abruptly.\n\nThe second problem is that the film tries to show virtually ALL events from the book (only some minor incidents like the Mahler detention, Peter Urbach, the burglaries in registration offices in order to steal blank passports or the visit of Jean-Paul Sartre in Stammheim are missing) so that it needs to squeeze 10 years of history into 140 minutes. The result is a film with breakneck speed at some points. The better scenes (e.g. the training camp in Jordan or the lawsuit in Stammheim) are obviously those where the film catches breath, calms down and takes its time for the actors to shine.\n\nThe quality of the acting ranges from good to fantastic (with very few exceptions like Alexandra Maria Lara, who is nothing more than wide-eyed again and who thankfully doesn&apos;t even have dialogue). Especially Martina Gedeck and Johanna Wokalek are sensational. It is THEIR film and the conflicts in Stammheim which led to Meinhof&apos;s suicide are acted Oscar-worthy. But Michael Gwisdek (Ensslin&apos;s father), Jan Josef Liefers (Peter Homann), Sebastian Blomberg (Rudi Dutschke), Nadja Uhl (Brigitte Mohnhaupt) and Hannah Herzsprung (Susanne Albrecht) are also very good.\n\nThe production values are excellent too. A lot of locations, a great deal of main and supporting roles, hundreds of extras, good special effects (mainly explosions) and a set design and costume design which creates a very coherent 70&apos;s atmosphere: you can see that the film cost a lot of money. Every cent is on the screen.\n\nI didn&apos;t like the choice of music that much. Deep Purple&apos;s &quot;Child in Time&quot; is always great to hear, but the rest (Janis Joplin, The Who, Bob Dylan) is just too mainstreamy and unimaginative for my taste (but probably also very expensive). Why not use MC5, Ton Steine Scherben or Ennio Morricone&apos;s &quot;Vamos a matar, companeros&quot;?\n\nNow I&apos;m looking forward to the reactions and reviews from other countries, who probably don&apos;t know this part of German history very well. In the US I expect the criticism that there are too many naked people, too many swear words and even more cigarettes (every one in BMK smokes everywhere and at all times), in order to distract from the politics of the film ;-) &quot;Der Baader Meinhof Komplex&quot; isn&apos;t the masterpiece on the history of the first generation of the RAF that I had hoped for in my comments on &quot;Todesspiel&quot;, but altogether it is a very suspenseful, fascinating, densely narrated and well acted film. Hopefully it will not be the last word on the subject, but it succeeds in giving the audience the basic RAF knowledge on which future (less neutral, more opinionated) movies can build their stories.",

The short gives a glimpse into the daily lives of the inhabitants in the Chilean port city. As it progresses, there are so many things that are captured, like the stairs, cable cars and the kids in the vicinity which feels like an ode to the city. The best part is towards the end when the film shifts from black and white to colour. Thoroughly interesting, visually magnificent, artistic on several levels and aesthetically pleasing. This is not for the fanbase of Ute Aurand (India), Ron Fricke (Samsara, Bakara) or Godfrey Reggio&apos;s Qatsi trilogy films. Regardless, I feel this will appeal to both the arthouse and the regular audience. To go on any further seems unnecessary, if you ever come across the chance to watch this feast upon its brilliance and the brilliant ending. I would also recommend O Ataque das Araras (1975), (Passacaglia y Fuga (1975) and Travelling with Tove / Matkalla Toven kanssa (1993) by Kanerva Cederstrom.",

      "reviewBody": "Once I actually spoke to Ann Harding on the telephone, but, alas, I didn&apos;t really know who she was. Yes, it was late in her life and early in mine, but if I had had the slightest idea what an extraordinary actress she had been, I would have been more forward, would have tried to spend time talking with her in person.\n\nI knew the name. She had been a star. But now having seen her in &quot;The Animal Kingdom,&quot; I am simply astonished at her ability.\n\nIn fact the entire cast is compelling. Even other people of whom I knew nothing or very little were impossible to look away from.\n\nFor example, &quot;Franc,&quot; played by Leni Stengel, was such a strong, and well-written, character, she was never over-shadowed even by the major characters. &quot;Joe,&quot; played by Don Dillaway, was another, and I had never heard of either actor before. Now I want to see everything they ever appeared in. The two actors were remarkable performers, contributing great talent to an already overwhelmingly talented cast.\n\nMyrna Loy played a strong and attractive &quot;society lady,&quot; but her character was different from the kind she is known for and gave her a chance to demonstrate she too was one fine actress, capable of variety, and not just a pretty face.\n\nLeslie Howard played, as it seemed he so often did, a rather weak character, but one capable of greatness, or at least potentially of strength.\n\nWilliam Gargan was wonderful as a supposed-to-be-servant who just didn&apos;t &quot;know his place.&quot; I&apos;ve never seen him in this type of role, and he was just captivating.\n\nBut Ann Harding stole it all.\n\nShe was, of course, beautiful, but her mannerisms and gestures, under played, just proved definitely that she was an actress, and an actress of power.\n\nHorace Jackson&apos;s script is based on a Philip Barry play so perhaps credit for the dialogue belongs mostly to Barry, but it&apos;s intelligent and entices an audience into sticking with everything happening on the screen, even though the actual story is rather sad. It&apos;s about misdirected desires, and sacrifices people really shouldn&apos;t make.\n\n&quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot; is a good movie, one I recommend, and one I am grateful to Turner Classic Movies for presenting on 9 December 2016. It is and has much more than the one-sentence description found in TV listings. It is much more than a soap opera. It is a strong drama beautifully acted and written, and deserving of serious attention.",

I don&apos;t know why the directors in India don&apos;t make more such movies. I think there should be a quality board for Hindi cinema which monitors the quality of movies. Movies like &quot;Ab Bas&quot; should not be allowed. I think bollywood should try to find a right mix between movies like Devdas and Chameli. And perhaps make movies like &quot;LAGAAN&quot; in every 5 years.",

But the images are so great, if you let yourself get caught up in them, I don&apos;t see the slow pacing to be a problem.

      "reviewBody": "A competition entry in Cannes from Italy in 1964, this Marco Ferreri Black-and-White satire cashes in on the real-life story of Julia Pastrana (1834-1860), an indigenous woman from Mexico, whose face and body was covered with straight black hair due to an undiagnosed genetic condition, and was exploited in freak shows as a hybrid between an ape and a woman. \n\nThe story is transposed to Naples, where Antonio (Tognazzi), a street-smart showman, alights on a hair-covered Maria (Girardot) in a convent (the script conveniently skates over her provenance by claiming her as an orphan), and takes her in for public exhibition as the so-called &quot;ape woman&quot;, but what Maria is is nothing like an ape, she is simply an extra hirsute woman, no feral predisposition or mondo sauciness whatsoever, she is very aware of her unorthodox appearance and never expects a life of normalcy, at any rate, she tries to please Antonio in their act because it is their bread-and- butter, even reluctantly apes the behavior of a chimpanzee in the zoo. When a suspect rich man wants to study her and over-insists that she must retain her virginity, an upstanding Maria rebuffs the deal whilst Antonio is much interested in the financial gain. \n\nImposed by the convent, the bachelor Antonio has to marry Maria to keep her with him, up till then Maria has developed a gentle affection (awakening sexuality in a more blunt language) towards Antonio whereas the latter still chastely intends to remain their relationship completely business- like, only to soon to surrender in sharing their tiny bed. A sortie in Paris, working their duo-act in a strip club, ensues and ends up with Maria becoming pregnant, after the struggle between abortion and otherwise, Pastrana&apos;s sad denouement is faithfully imitated into the movie with an uninviting coda where stillborn, death and embalmment are the keywords, all of a sudden levity turns into a biting critique of humanity, Ferreri never compromised in that regard. \n\nBasically a two-hander, Tognazzi is well in his element with his slick impression and occasionally, considerable benevolence seeps through his non-threatening nonchalance. Girardot, on the other hand, is hampered in the slipshod make-up (understandably, the movie is half-an-century old), her hairy physiognomy is nonetheless non-too-startling so as to pander to a wider audience, not to mention a stripping sequence to gratifying male gaze. As a satire, we must admire Ferreri&apos;s guts to preserve &quot;the phenomenon is eternal&quot; sting, but as a cinematic creation, THE APE WOMAN is a bog-standard treatment gussied up by an alluring premise it short-changes in realisation.",

      "description": "THE APE WOMAN is the highest-praised film by Marco Ferreri, the over-the-top iconoclastic director known for &apos;La Grande Bouffe&apos;. His signature edgy exploration of the grotesque was revered by the Cannes Festival who awarded many of his works.\n\nThe film is inspired by a true story of the nihilistically cruel exploitation of a young carnival performer, Julia Pastrana, whose body was completely covered in hair.\n\nShe is brought to life here by an extraordinary Annie Girardot -France&apos;s highest-paid actress of the time - in a natural measured and elegant performance from which emanates the ambiguous emotion of being alluring yet devastatingly poignant as &apos;the ape woman&apos;.\n\nAn unscrupulous hustler (a magnificent Ugo Tognazzi), discovers the young woman in a convent and marries her in order to get her on the freak-show circuit and cash in on the distinctive appearance of her body and face covered in hair.",

      "reviewBody": "Lillian Hellman, one of America&apos;s most famous women playwrights, was a woman with a mission. Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country. In her memoir, she recounts her trip to the then, Soviet Union, as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system. &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; must have come as a result of those years. The left wing in America, as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe, but in Japan as well.\n\n&quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In it Ms. Hellman was heralding America&apos;s entrance in World War II. The adaptation is credited to Ms. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her long time companion. As directed for the screen by Herman Shumlin, the film was well received when it premiered in 1943.\n\nWe are introduced to the Muller family, when the film opens. They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico. They are to continue toward Mrs. Muller&apos;s home in Washington, D.C., where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a minor celebrity hostess. The Mullers, we realize are fleeing Europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we thought, in a way, the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jewish, fleeing from a sure extermination.\n\nWe find out that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing Fascim. Little does he know that he is coming to his mother-in-law&apos;s house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy.\n\nThe film offers excellent acting all around. It is a curiosity piece because of Bette Davis&apos; supporting role. Paul Lukas, repeating his Broadway role, is quite convincing as Kurt Muller, the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job portraying Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway.\n\nThe other best performance is by Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancovis, a guest of the Farrellys, married to the contemptible Teck de Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods, and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by Mr. Shumlin.\n\nThe film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1999, Gregory Peck was able to tour the country and make a series of &quot;Conversations&quot; with live audiences. He told stories (and anecdotes) about his own biography and members of his family. During his live conversations, he entertained questions from the audience. Questions ranged from personal questions to questions about his movies and his movie career that spanned more than 50 years (1944-1998). \n\nInterspersed among these &quot;conversations,&quot; the documentary shows many family gatherings and informal shots of Peck just enjoying his travels, friends, and family. Also included in this film are shots of him doing other interviews and guest shots over the years. It is clear that he was sharing (with an audience) his personal memories by making this documentary film. \n\n---One question involved which scene was more scary to film—the swamp fight with Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear (1962) or being attack by the dogs in The Boys from Brazil (1978). His answer was that his most scary scene to film was when he was riding on a balloon-like replica of a whale in the Irish Sea for Moby Dick (1956) \n\nWithout doubt, his personal favorite of his films was To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and he shares many memories about the making of that film. But, he also included comical comments (and entertained questions about) some of his less favorite movies too. (Of course, he was part of the editing of the final documentary, so we only see those shots he wanted to show us. However, this is a great film about an actor who started his career on stage for several years before moving it to the big screen in 1944.)",

      "name": "Yet another western, though it is made watchable by a few new story angles.",
      "reviewBody": "Kirk Douglas had already directed the somewhat terrible Scalawag in 1973, but that previous flop did not deter him from having a second stab at the directing job a couple of years on. Fortunately, Posse is a much more accomplished film than Scalawag in every way: Douglas&apos;s own direction is more assured, the script by Christopher Knopf and William Roberts is very literate and clever, and Fred Koenekamp&apos;s cinematography has a good, professional look about it. By 1975, one would have thought that there would be little mileage left in the western genre. It seemed that nothing new could be done, but this one comes up with a fresh twist by having the &quot;hero&quot; gradually revealed as an unlikable and ambitious social climber.\n\nMarshal Howard Nightingale (Douglas) publicly announces that he will bring in infamous railroad bandit Jack Strawhorn (Bruce Dern). Although Strawhorn is a criminal of considerable notoriety - and definitely a man who belongs behind bars - Nightingale has an ulterior motive for apprehending his man. For the good Marshal has decided to run for the Texan senate, and believes that if he can nail Strawhorn - painting himself as a hero into the bargain - he will win over plenty of voters. Gradually, more and more people begin to see through Nightingale&apos;s selfish and egotistical political plans. His own posse have their doubts about how they will figure in the Marshal&apos;s future schemes; a news editor named Hellman (James Stacy) expresses distrust over the Marshal&apos;s ludicrously self-important opinion of himself; even Strawhorn eventually realises what his sly adversary is up to. Ultimately, Nightingale loses his posse and his public favour, with a little clever intervention from Strawhorn, and sees his political dreams left in tatters.\n\nThe critical response to Posse was much more favourable than Douglas&apos;s previous directing attempt, and deservedly so. The western action in the film is good, solid stuff, not too violent (as was the trend in &apos;75), but certainly tough enough to satisfy genre addicts. Douglas gives a strong performance as the absurdly self-obsessed marshal, and Dern is even better as the charismatic, even likable, bandit. The subversive nature of the plot (hero gradually turns out to be villain, villain gradually turns out to be hero) is intriguing and fairly fresh, and helps to add interest to the film. While Posse has occasional lulls, and a few noticeably amateurish performances lower down the cast list, it remains a fresh, interesting, and intriguing addition to a virtually exhausted genre.",

This movie is one you should definitely see if you enjoy such quality films like Vertigo, Psycho and most recently Identity. Massive kudos to Christian Bale who turned himself into a skeleton for the role and the wonderfully articulate pace of the director! As you watched it, you knew that there were answers at the end and the journey was simply captivating! Also fine, fine work by Michael Ironside and the absolutely gorgeous Jennifer Jason-Leigh who to this day looks just as hot as she did in Fast Times! If you have a chance to see this film and an open mind, make the trip to the ciniplex! Fantastic film!",

      "reviewBody": "Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines in the on-going mountain men franchise continues to slash it&apos;s way through stupid characters, lame decisions made by the characters, gruesome CGI like deaths and gory galore. It was an average and quite medicorish film which holds and shows corny and cheesy moments throughout the entire film.\n\nLooking back a year from now, I thought Wrong Turn 4 was bad. It wasn&apos;t awful but it was average. This film falls back under the ban wagon, nearly going in the same direction that the third film from (2009) did.\n\nI&apos;m not a massive fan of the 3rd and 5th films but I&apos;d rather watch this one over the 3rd, but on the prequel or the classic first two. BUt once again, Declan O&apos; Brien has no idea of what Horror films or Slasher films are. He continues to use horrible CGI effects, wasteful moments which could be great, excessive nudity/gore and a story line which he promises which will be good, accept only holding many plot holes which need to be grand, to create a solid premise throughout. Oh well, after these 3, we can only expect the next sequel or so to be the same if we still have the same creator behind the task.\n\nIf you love slasher films and I mean love them, Wrong Turn 5 is definitely up your ally. If you dislike films in this age with it&apos;s predictable moments with no suspense, avoid it. I didn&apos;t hate it like the 3rd but didn&apos;t find it averagely decent like the 4th, but instead just found it Time Wasting Material. I found the characters stupid, the mutants (accept for Three-Finger) looked stupid, everything like i mentioned before (who was going to die, supposed jump scares) was all predictable. I was able to guess this film&apos;s every move. The use of CGI in the film is pretty annoying and lastly, it is quite tedious. Another aspect I found disappointing was the story and where the entire story took place. The start, in the dreaded woods was quite promising and then putting it in the town, just stupid! Another element with the hill-billies slaughtering people at a celebration in the year 1817 was also a really stupid element for the director to add in! It never made any sense nor do I think it had anything to do with the hillbillies lives!\n\nThe only real prop I can give this film was Doug Bradely. He actually didn&apos;t too badly, despite the cheesy, predictable material he was given.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s not horrible but it&apos;s not great either. I believe that if they continue to have Declan O&apos; Brien behind the camera, the Wrong Turn franchise will continue to be a predictable, no suspense on the gore mess.\n\n5/10. I&apos;d rather watch it than the 3rd one.",

True, love slows the women up, but outside of that they are tough as can be.\n\nI saw this movie with badly-done subtitles I downloaded off the Internet, so I was sometimes a little unclear as to what was going on, but the movie is such crazy fun that I barely minded.",

      "reviewBody": "A short and very interesting documental about the anarchists in Argentina and Uruguay in early XX century. Who were and what were the thoughts of Severino de Giovanni and Simón Radowitzky? Who was Rosigna? The movie begins showing the Ushuaia (Tierra del Fuego) prison, where Radowitzky lived a lot of years after killing Ramón Falcón, chief of the Federal Police (who had killed a lot of workers during a manifestation). Then, it goes to the arrival to Buenos Aires of thousands of Italians, Spanish and Jewish immigrants, the origin of half the population of Argentina and Uruguay, between them the first anarchists and socialists of the River Plate. Nowadays can be curious to see that such idealists could attack a bank (sometimes killing people) and steal a lot of money only for editing books or pamphlets, as their lives went on in a pathetic material poverty. It is interesting to see how was planned the escape of anarchists from Punta Carretas prison of Montevideo. One anarquist settled a coal shop in front of the prison, and a tunnel was dug from there to prison. Some decades before, there was a flight of Tupamaros prisoners in the same way. The anarchists were defeated by militar dictatorships and because the appearing of peronism in 1946 (the creol working class had less contact with European political ideas). Di Giovanni was executed in prison, Radowitzky after being put free fought in the Spanish Civil War, Rosigna was put free in Uruguay but disappeared (killed indeed). Perhaps there are few emphasis in the origin of their ideals and the difference between the pacifists and violent ways they employ for fighting. The testimony of anarchist writer Osvaldo Bayer, a niece of Rosigna, a former Tupamaro and old anarchists contribute to have a wider viewpoint.",

      "reviewBody": "Canicule or Dog day is completely bonkers. It is a cartoon really, but a pretty violent and ludicrous one. Lee Marvin in one of his final roles is not given enough screen time, only at the climax of the film is he terrific, really giving his all as the dying gangster (he was probably ill himself then). In the rest of the film he looks on in disbelief and looks like he would rather be elsewhere. There is a lot of &apos;business&apos; going on inside the farm which is not worth going into and much of the film would be seen a French Farce or as being like &apos;Carry on&apos; or &apos;Benny Hill&apos;- if it was not so violent or just plain nasty in its depiction and abuse of its characters.\n\nThe film is violent towards women and negative about humans and sexuality in general. The film collapses into the absurd as the body count mounts up as the crazy inhabitants of the farm, police and nearby innocents are all brutally wiped out and the best remaining parts are between the small boy in his surreal &apos;boat&apos; shaped den and the great Marvin. Ne actor has looked this dislocated from a film since Terence Stamp in &apos;Theorem&apos;. Lee Marvin was a great actor, but this film is not worthy of him and is only worth a look if you want to see Marvin in this piece of weird French surrealism.",

Certainly, there was no other film like it. I really wonder what sort of attitude the filmmakers had when this was being made. Were they giggling fiendishly, thinking of all the people they would scare with these images? (Scaring people was obviously their plan.) Did they think the movie they were making was &quot;cool&quot;?\n\nThe action-packed climax is pretty much the last fifteen minutes of the film. The brain creatures attack the people in the house, and pretty soon, bullets are flying, axes are being swung, and brains are being sucked. In my mind, this completely, mind-blowingly over-the-top ending scene seemed to go on forever, like a seriously bad nightmare. It was so repellently real. The creatures have no eyes, and they sort of &quot;sense&quot; your presence electrically to zero in on you, before flying up at you and clamping themselves onto the back of your neck. The depiction of this was pretty effective, and it still surprises me how well thought-out the creature imagery was here. Surprisingly realistic.\n\nIt still works, quite well! Go see it."

      "reviewBody": "A couple of days before the end of World War II, seven sixteen year-old German boys of a small village are recruited for military service. The idealistic Hans Scholten (Folker Bohnet), Albert Mutz (Fritz Wepper), Walter Forst (Michael Hinz), Jurgen Borchert (Frank Glaubrecht), Karl Horber (Karl Michael Balzer), Klaus Hager (Volker Lechtenbrink) and Sigi Bernhard (Günther Hoffmann) join the army on 26 April 1945 with great expectations and enthusiasm to defend their motherland Germany in the front against the will of their parents. Their English teacher Stern (Wolfgang Stumpf) unsuccessfully tries to convince Commander Fröhlich (Heinz Spitzner) to refuse the enlistment of the youngsters. After one day training, the soldiers are summoned to the front but the Commander of the 463rd Battalion of the 3rd Company assigns Sergeant Heilmann (Günter Pfitzmann) to stay with the rookies &quot;protecting&quot; a useless bridge in their village in order to spare the boys. However, in the chaos of the imminent defeat with German soldiers fleeing from the American troops, Heilmann is murdered and the boys defend the small bridge with their lives on 27 April 1945.\n\n&quot;Die Brücke&quot; is another powerful and impressive German film about coming of age in times or war. This anti-war movie probably reflects the thoughts of the brain-washed youngsters by the Nazi ideology and propaganda in the 40&apos;s and is heartbreaking to see sixteen year-old boys playing war like a game and without awareness of the seriousness of the situation. Being a father, it is also very sad to see the powerless widows and mothers trying to protect their enthusiastic sons that want to fight to defend their country. The realism of this dramatic movie is awesome and totally different from the approach of Hollywood movies, where Germans are usually evil soldiers and the situation of the civilian population is forgotten, but unfortunately it has not been released in Brazil on VHS or DVD. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

Howard). Unfortunately, doubling up those films still only adds up to average.\n\nFor a while it feels as if &apos;Solomon Kane&apos; might actually be something special. Anchored by James Purefoy (channeling Hugh Jackman), and supported by strong performances from Rachel Hurd-Wood and the late Pete Postlethwaite, the first act firmly establishes a character and stakes that we care about. But around the half way point it begins to run out of steam, settling for generic genre conventions executed with little of the flair and none of the human focus evidenced earlier in the film.\n\n&apos;Solomon Kane&apos; had all the pieces to be something special. That it ends up merely being a serviceable time-waster is ironically more frustrating than if it were simply a bad film.",

Gray Owl as an white and wanting to live the native way, is called a &quot;White Indian&quot;.\n\nThis movie shows him living on and around Bear Island, in Northern Ontario. Gray Owl, shows us his view of their life through his eyes and explain how the northern Canadian native; has been changed by civilization. (trapping,hunting and tourism as in the scene where the &quot;War dance&quot; is performed after a hat-passing collection) It is also an interesting documentary of how the Canadian beaver became a part of the 5 cent coin; as the story advances into how Gray Owl worked to conserve and even reinstate this animal which was endangered from over trapping.\n\nThe story is beautiful told to us who know and live the savage life of the Northern wilderness and how beautiful it is to return to the basic of nature and leave problems of civilization behind.\n\nThe scene of most important, to me, also a white Indian, is when Gray Owl meets the Americian Chiefs and they all laugh at the blue-eyed would-a-be Indian. But the quote of the chief was how it did not matter the color of one skin but the color of one&apos;s heart. \n\nEveryone should have a dream, but if a Gray Owl we can live this dream it is beautiful.. Another similar and great movie of this type is &quot;The return of a Man called Horse&quot; with Richard Harris.\n\nA lot can be learned from this movie.. even now after I have visited the area and met the people, I still see great lessons. (for example, Gray Owls friend is an Cree and shown this native group,living with the Ojibway on Bear Island.\n\nInteresting off-side of this film is a recent development of an Australian who just finished a summer on Bear Island after wanting to learn about the source of this film. &quot;Broken Arrow - A white Indian&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "This is the first of three films in which Georges Simenon&apos;s marvellous creation Jules Maigret is played by Jean Gabin. Rather plodding initially and resembling a standard &apos;policier&apos;, it takes on a new dimension and becomes totally absorbing with the appearance of Annie Girardot, Jean Desailly and Lucienne Bogaert all of whom are fantastic. In the title role Gabin&apos;s screen presence is undeniable but he is far more effective in his quieter moments than when called upon to emote. The ubiquitous Michel Audiard contributes dialogue which is always a plus whilst Louis Page is behind the camera as he was for the two subsequent films. Excellent score by Paul Misraki. At almost two hours it is a wee bit long for a whodunnit but one&apos;s interest is sustained by a brilliant cast and superb editing by Henri Taverna. Director Jean Delannoy has served Simenon well by concentrating on the psychological complexity of the characters.. The same director teamed up with Gabin the following year for &apos;Maigret et L&apos;Affaire Saint-Fiacre&apos; in which Gabin&apos;s portrayal is mellower and is ably supported by Valentine Tessier and Michel Auclair. The rest of the cast however is strictly &apos;B&apos;. Five years were to elapse before &apos;Maigret voit Rouge&apos; for director Gilles Grangier with whom Gabin made no less than twelve films! Despite some interesting &apos;types&apos; this is basically one Maigret too far and nothing more than a mediocre gangster movie. We all have our favourite Maigret of course and mine happens to be Harry Bauer. Apparently Simenon himself favoured Rupert Davis!? Oh well, fools give you reasons, wise men never try&apos;!",

      "reviewBody": "Revisiting Romeo is Bleeding after a number of years, I was struck by what still works, what doesn&apos;t, and how wonderful endings allow us to overlook any number of faults that lead up to them.\n\nGary Oldman is Jack, a corrupt DS well-loved by his men looking to build an ill-gotten nest egg towards early retirement. And on one level it is all going so well, except enough is never enough, and he just can&apos;t leave the ladies alone.\n\nEnter Mona (Lena Olin), a femme fatale who manages to inhabit both the femme and the fatale completely. The cop in Jack knows to cuff her, lock her up, and throw away the key, but the Jack in Jack has another agenda.\n\nRomeo is Bleeding is every frame a modern noir thriller, made great by Hilary Henkin&apos;s script exhibiting detailed reverence for the genre, and some unparalleled performances by the actors. Oldman is breath-taking, cynical and world-weary delivering his Marlowe-style quips, raw and vulnerable reaching crescendo when he puts a gun barrel in his mouth. It would be too much to ask his co-stars to outshine him, but they certainly keep up. Olin produces a nightmarish laugh at the most inappropriate times, and Juliette Lewis&apos;s cocktail waitress (what else?) Sheri&apos;s innocence is perfectly ignorant, far too ignorant to survive in this brutal arena. Annabella Sciorra as Natalie completes the trio of Jack&apos;s women, his not-so-unaware wife. She is not as cold-hearted towards Jack as Mona, not as infatuated as Sheri, but her flawed love contains a bit of both. She points a gun at him, and we know she knows. Sitting on the porch they have one of those oblique conversations only old married couples know, where every utterance is sub-text, and restraint and feigned ignorance are the name of the game. Jack never quite gets to grips with her, and that is to be his ultimate tragedy.\n\nThere are hints of Chandler here (the letter to Jack from The Boys), and Chinatown, too, most noticeably in the bloodied, deformed demeanor of the protagonist in the final third, but Romeo is Bleeding is a stylish noir piece that acknowledges its antecedents without racking up debts.\n\nAnd then there is the ending, of such heartbreaking, poignant beauty, Oldman and Sciorra pitch-perfect, deftly shot and edited, a wave you ride and crash on shore with. Startling, stunning, and yet how could this tale have ended otherwise? &quot;Sometimes, she stays a little longer. And then she&apos;s gone.&quot; Not a perfect film, but a perfect ending, and I&apos;ll take that every time.",

Oh my, Josh Lucas, the coach was amazing on film as well as the &quot;real coach&quot; he portrayed. How wonderful he was to be &quot;color blind&quot; when coaching the game of basketball, down in the south where there was so much cruelty and prejudice.\n\nThis was a heartfelt movie where often, I got upset to see how cruel people would be to others, just because of the color of their skin. I am &quot;white&quot; though not white like this screen, lol, and raised in Los Angeles during the late 60&apos;s/70&apos;s and just never understood why people would not like you, without even knowing you just because of your looks/race.\n\nAnyway, go see the movie, it is great! The beautiful tatyana ali who was on since a child Fresh Prince of Bel Air, I almost did not recognize her.....she did such a marvelous job acting in the role of Tina!"

      "name": "Another Biblical Tale Around a Peripheral Character",
      "reviewBody": "The Robe comes from a tradition of historical biblical fiction about a peripheral incident and/or character. It is in the same vein as Ben-Hur and Barabbas, films adapted from a similar source.\n\nIn this case it is Jesus&apos;s robe that he wore to the crucifixion. It is recorded that while He was on the cross waiting to die, Roman soldiers idled their time away by casting dice for the only possession He took to his death, his robe. The lucky winner turned out to be Richard Burton, a tribune recently sent on assignment because of a running feud with the Emperor to be.\n\nThe run in with Caligula was over a slave purchased by Burton, a Greek named Demetrius played by Victor Mature. Both Burton and Mature are exiled to Judea and they arrive just in time to see Jesus enter Jerusalem. Mature becomes converted to Jesus&apos;s teachings and Burton is driven mad by the enormity of what he has participated in. \n\nThe Robe was written by Lloyd C. Douglas who was an ordained Lutheran minister and who turned to writing at the age of 50 with his first best seller Magnificent Obsession. His writings were of the Christian inspirational variety and he was a very popular American writer right up to his death in 1951. \n\nRichard Burton got one of his Academy Award nominations for his role. Jean Simmons as Diana who was the main source of his rivalry with Caligula gives a good understated performance of the woman who stood by the man she loved and his fate and passed up a chance to be an Empress.\n\nJay Robinson as Caligula got most of the notice. Although John Hurt in the I Claudius series is probably now the definitive Caligula, Robinson&apos;s performance holds up very well indeed. A substance abuse problem curtailed a promising career and though he did come back it was not the same.\n\nThe Robe was 20th Century Fox&apos;s first film in its new wide screen process of Cinemascope and really should be seen in a letter box version at home. Richard Burton is always good and elevates whatever film he&apos;s in.\n\nThough in this case the subject matter is elevated just about as high as it can get.",

It doesn&apos;t quite help that the poetry is a little on the high school side. Michael Moore does a better job of being one sided while seeming to be righteous.\n\nThe documentary simply suffers from having too many subjects. Every revolution shown was just skimming the surface. The producers knew that too, which is why the Palestine conflict had just less than 10 minutes of screen time. With a more narrow focus and some balanced reporting, this could have been good.\n\nIt would be better to just watch Fahrenheit 911 or some Noam Chomsky documentary - power and terror - is good.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is about a day in the life of a hit man played by actor Mark Whalberg. Melvin (Mark Whalberg) has good life thanks to his talent as a hit man, but has very working class mentality going about his life. But none of the girls he associates with shares his work ethics, but just sees him as a cash cow, and a guy to dump all their troubles on to, until Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips) kidnaps a Japanese mogul Jiro&apos;s (Sab Nishi) daughter Keiko (China Chow) and dumps her on to his lap. Keiko is the first to sympathize with Melvin and hits it off with him.\n\nThere are three stories going on simultaneously in this movie: One with Cisco and his boss Paris (Avery Brooks) who&apos;s a friend of Jiro&apos;s and wants the guy who kidnapped Keiko dead (not knowing that it&apos;s actually Cisco who did it). Second with Melvin&apos;s girl friend Pam (Christina Applegate) who&apos;s Jewish, and has a mother who is against her marrying this Irish Catholic guy. Third with Melvin and Keiko who&apos;s being kept at his house. All three converge at Melvin&apos;s house at lunch, and pandemonium breaks loose.\n\nThe story line is one of the most original, and is a feel good movie &apos;90s style where the under dog anti-hero gets the good he deserves in the end. The riot is seeing all the other materialistic people around Melvin all trying to take advantage of him showing how nice of a guy he is despite his choice of profession.\n\nWas this movie great ? Yes !! And is highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Ever since soft core 3D porn of the sixties and &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; of the seventies, adult films have been obsessed with the fantasies of stewardesses and cheerleaders. (I found out the phone number of Bambi, head cheerleader of Dallas fame, but it wouldn&apos;t do you any good today after it was changed in 1988) Our current breed of cheerleader Class of 2008 follows all the modern styles. Her voice squeaks in the same high-pitched tone. You would think one girl&apos;s voice is dubbing the whole sound track. She often wears beads or tattoos, but luck has it that they don&apos;t cover up anything good. And the sex, oh, it just couldn&apos;t be real! One guy jacks off five times in a detention room scene. They must&apos;ve been filmed over at different times far apart and spliced together to look like one continuous scene. Aside from the hot hardcore sex and a lesbian group scene desperately needing a dildo, there is little else to recommend above the average porn flick, although I must admit Stoya&apos;s grinning during a three way scene stood out from the crowd. Sets are cheaper than most films of this type. There aren&apos;t even any shower scenes. I guess the producers couldn&apos;t afford to put in faucets. Of course it is touted has having &quot;the most explosive sex ever filmed in HD.&quot; Here is a true claim. Not many large budget porn films have been filmed in HD, yet. But few still like old scratchy transfers that often fill up catalogs featuring the now senior-aged famous of porno.",

      "reviewBody": "Saw this film last night at the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris, in the course of the Douglas Sirk &quot;integrale&quot; (complete retrospective). Sirk himself calls this film &quot;Viennese pastry,&quot; and adds that, after the heaviness of &quot;Schlussakkord&quot; he felt the need of something light. Light it is, but also marvelously inventive. I was reminded of Ophuls&apos;s film of &quot;The Bartered Bride,&quot; not only in that the two principals in both films are singers and very appealing, but, too, that Sirk, like Ophuls, tells his tale in a deliciously opulent way. The screen seems to be constantly filled with new and beautiful detail, the camera usually in swinging, swirling motion. A very baroque film.\n\nMarta Eggerth, later well known to American audiences for her appearances in operetta with her husband tenor Jan Kiepura, has the appeal of a European Jeanette MacDonald, and her co-star, Johannes Heesters, is wonderfully handsome, with a winning (and almost ever-present) smile. Charming film, very entertaining, and worth seeing for the mise-en-scene alone.",

Did Davinci have secret knowledge about Jesus? We&apos;ll probably never know&apos; The End. The END?! this has nothing to do with anything. the re-enactments are soooo dumb at one point there&apos;s this thing about a french priest being given money to make over his church back in the 1800&apos;s and he&apos;s handed American paper money! They show some ancient knights that were suppose to have unearthed the grail and they all had neatly trimmed beards, they showed &apos;middle eastern&apos; men(one who&apos;s name was Mohammad Ali) digging up a vase in the desert but they were all old white dude&apos;s speaking English. This movie made me sad cause i spend money to watch it, which, because i bought it at walmart ill be able to get back, the hour of my life i spent watching it, however, is gone for good."

      "reviewBody": "Derek Jarman was, like his contemporary Peter Greenaway still is, a visual artist working in film. The usual obsessions of the movie industry didn&apos;t occupy him overmuch. Psychology, character development, narrative, plot - all those were secondary considerations, if they were considered at all. The main preoccupation was the expressive power of the the image. To those of us reared on conventional, industrial cinema, this makes Jarman&apos;s (and Greenaway&apos;s) work both refreshing and frustrating in equal measure. \n\nSEBASTIANE is not, then, a conventional film. It would be misleading to assess it in conventional terms. At times it is jokey, revelling in its low budget and independent spirit. At other times, it is so beautiful it takes your breath away. And at other times it seems to crawl along, with dull acting beneath a luxuriously blue Sardinian sky.\n\nLeonardo Treviglio is a stunning, intense Sebastian, a Renaissance painting come to life. As his tormentor Severus, Barney James successfully conveys frustration and bewilderment behind his icy-grey eyes. Richard Warwick (probably the best known actor, having made a mark as one of the young rebels in Lindsay Anderson&apos;s IF...) is quietly impressive as Sebastian&apos;s only friend in the outpost. A lot is required of Neil Hamilton as the gruff Maximus, which is a pity because he is unconvincing enough to be a distraction. \n\nPersonally, I think SEBASTIANE succeeds as a cinematic study of the isolation at the centre of martyrdom. It doesn&apos;t indulge in psychological speculation. It simply depicts some of the temptations, struggles, and sufferings involved. The sensuality of the lives of the other soldiers is at odds with the kind of life Sebastian wants to live. Jarman and his co-director (and editor) Paul Humfress show all this with great clarity.\n\nHowever, one of the side-effects of such clarity is emotional detachment. We watch as if the film were an installation in an art gallery. Nothing wrong with that, as long as you remember that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking at. Otherwise you might emerge from SEBASTIANE thinking that it&apos;s a failure, a halfway-house between an art-film and a porn-movie. For me, though, it&apos;s pretty successful on its own terms. And because it was a pioneering piece of film-making in other ways (Latin dialogue, gay lovemaking, self-conscious anachronisms), SEBASTIANE will always have a place in cinema history.",

A LOT of drama.\n\nApatow should either write, or direct his movies, not both. I have a feeling if someone else took the directors chair/ producers chair, the movie would be significantly shorter.\n\nI don&apos;t mind drama in movies, but when the extra hour of the movie is filled up with only drama, then I become irritated.\n\nThis is a movie you should rent/watch on Netflix. The writing and direction are both good, but you need to pace yourself, take breaks, come back later after getting some air, because 2.5 hours is to long for a movie like this.\n\nThis is all my opinion of course, so take it or leave it. \n\nRegardless of anything, enjoy your night out at the movies, you earned it!",

I was impressed that in 1970 there was a nude bedroom scene. I did compare it to Damage with Jeremy Irons and what they visibly display nowadays. G.P. and Tuesday Weld did a great job without that display. Ralph Meeker was a charmer as always. It does not require an R rating. The incest was suggested in a subtle fashion. Albeit an eerie moment. The photography was very interesting. I am not a Johnny Cash fan but his music was fitting. Loved the film. Azignon"

A young man, desperate to save his mother from a possibly fatal illness, agrees to let Dr. Lamb (Chaney) operate on him. He has had two failures, but insists things will go well for the young man. But factors intervene, including a hunchback (failed experiment) and the doctor&apos;s wife, who knows the perils of her husband&apos;s obsessions.

      "reviewBody": "This abominable Heimatfilm originally started as a documentary about the Austrian Steiermark environment, but with the (cinematographic) results the producer was thàt happy that he decided to elaborate the material into a feature film. For this purpose a poor script overloaded with the genre&apos;s banalities was written, including a conservative &quot;blood and soil&quot; tendency. Two unknown leads were casted, who would become runners up to the Heimatfilm regulars Marianne Hold and Rudolf Prack: Anita Gutwell and Rudolf Lenz, who both surpass  Hold and Prack in being empty headed. \n\nConsidered a classic in its genre recent notes state that there is very modern (progressive) aspect to this film. This would be the resistance against plans to cut down a wood for the sake of money. I am definite in saying that this aspect is judged wrongly; do not forget that the subject of the film as such is not the cutting of the wood, but the resistance against any progress (= modern city life) and a plea for the old traditional values of the confined Heimat. \n\nImportant is that granddaughter Gutwell comes back from the city to find happiness in the Heimat, and not wearing  &quot;city&quot;clothes anymore, but traditional costume (almost forced on her by the grandfather; an appalling character: why was not he shot in stead of the deer). Note that Gutwell&apos;s (former) boy-friend from the city unavoidably turns out to be a no-good, while the Lenz character is goodness and kindness itself; all this is to stress the basic premise of the film: life is best lived within conservative traditions. In reference to this basic subject the resistance against the cutting down of the wood is not important, but the symbolic meaning of it: resistance against progress, against a change in life style, but also fear of the unknown.\n\nWatching this film I again wondered why the average &quot;blood and soil&quot; Heimatfilm is not only unbearable for its subject, but also for its poor execution. In this film there is hardly any feeling for unity, timing and rhythm, the acting is poor  (and not only by the two leads), and most scenes are  staged, shot and cut and pasted in a dull way to say the least. It is as if the execution was hardly important and the main purpose of the film was to confirm existing prejudices.",

I am not sure many will be too curious or mind to be honest. But you&apos;ve been warned.\n\nThat all being said, the movie is really well made. The effects are a bit better than the first one. It would have been nice if they had made this into a trilogy, but I reckon it didn&apos;t pay off - so they got off. Well not in the sense the viewers would have liked of course. Beautiful women and men getting it on for our viewing pleasure. This even got a Blu Ray release in our video store - that says a lot I reckon. Although maybe not. Story wise it is a bit better than the first one ... but mayhem ensues and everyone involved does seem to have fun ... can you blame them?",

      "reviewBody": "Lizabeth Scott has &quot;A Stolen Face&quot; and also has the face that was stolen in this 1952 film also starring Paul Henreid and directed by Terence Fisher. Scott plays a beautiful concert pianist, Alice Brent, who meets Dr. Philip Ritter (Henreid), a plastic surgeon, while he&apos;s on vacation. They fall in love, but she leaves suddenly. She&apos;s involved with her manager and rather than confront the situation, she just takes off.\n\nDevastated, Ritter returns to his practice, part of which is done at a prison where he reconstructs patients&apos; injured or deformed faces to help them rehabilitate and live better, crime-free lives. One such patient is Lily Conover (Mary Mackenzie), a thief whose face is disfigured on one side. Ritter makes her over to look like Alice Brent and marries her. Lily, however, can&apos;t quite rehabilitate. She feels stifled by the doctor&apos;s lifestyle and starts stealing and hanging with her old crowd. Then Alice Brent decides she can&apos;t marry her manager and pays Philip a visit.\n\nThis film could be considered a camp classic - the story is, but the performances are quite good. Until he returns from vacation, Dr. Ritter is a fine doctor, totally professional and generous. A bad love affair makes him into an obsessed whacko who makes over a thief into the woman he loves and marries her. Go figure. And I agree with one of the comments here - why Alice Brent didn&apos;t cut and run when she realized what he did defies imagination.\n\nScott is older here than in her big noir days but is radiant and beautiful in both roles. She&apos;s more animated than in other films and pulls off the Cockney nicely. The only strange thing there was that when the makeover was complete, Lily suddenly had Alice&apos;s very distinctive husky voice.\n\nHenried gives a good performance in an impossible role. How do you play a warm, normal, hardworking man who does a complete turnaround with no indication in the script as to where it came from, no tendencies beforehand, no grasping obsession during the affair - and suddenly a patient goes under the knife and emerges Lizabeth Scott. Only in Hollywood. I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.",

      "reviewBody": "I am a retired American who taught world history. Although Charles II is shown as an all-around swell guy beset with disloyal jerks waiting to kill him, he was, in fact, a divine right king who managed to eventually lose much of the good will the English had towards him when the monarchy was restored. The English were dreadfully sorry they chopped off the head of Charles I and were ready to make amends. Charles, however, wasn&apos;t about to learn the lesson of his father-- and continued to behave as if he was never to be challenged in his role as king. Things really were bad...so bad that when his brother, James II, took the thrown the English soon chased him out of the country and replaced the Stuarts with a Dutch king and queen. So, as I watched the film, I had to laugh because it did re-write history just a tad! But enough of a mini lecture...on to the film itself.\n\nThe film is about yet another plot to kill the king by a disloyal bunch of jerks. However, there is a small book with this information in it--and it&apos;s stolen by a group of highway men! Are these crooks evil crooks or the Hollywood type who are intensely loyal Englishman who love their king? Through the course of this film you&apos;ll learn! \n\nSo although it might not be all that accurate, is this an enjoyable film? No. Not really. Like too many period films, the dialog is stilted and the picture lacks humanity and realism. It looks like a stagy production and sounds like one too. Watchable but hardly a must-see.",

It seems to be about a young boy who has a lumpy metal pole that is growing out of his back. He finds some kind of apparatus that transports him to an ominous nether-world where he and a fierce woman with a book attached to her head fight some scary motorized vampire-thugs. Eventually he meets a heroic older guy who also has a pole growing out of his back--I think this guy might be sort of an idealized version of himself. Then he is transported back to his own world. This film has all the visual kicks of the first Tetsuo, but it&apos;s much more raw, and in color. It seems to have been produced on 16mm. It has a weird, fun, dorky innocence that the later Tetsuo films only vestigally had. It is very punk rock. I loved it... I wish I could see it shown on actual film, with English subtitles."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Punisher&quot; (1990) starring Dolph Lundgren and Louis Gossett, Jr. is a movie adaptation of the Marvel Comics character about a presumed dead police officer who wages a one man war on crime.  In this big screen adaptation, The Punisher (Lundgren) rises from the sewers to battle the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) who have come to America to try to force the current reigning Franco crime family, headed by Gianni Franco (Jeroen Krabbe) out of business.  To do this, the Yakuza headed by Lady Tanaka (Kim Miyori) have kidnapped the children of all the crime bosses.  The Punisher reluctantly enters into this complex triangle to try to rescue the children.   \n\nI must say that &quot;The Punisher&quot; is a rather solid adaptation of the Marvel Comics character of the same name.  Dolph Lundgren proves that he can carry a movie.  He can really kick some a** in this film. The action scenes may prove to be the best parts of this movie.  Probably the best action sequence is the scene where The Punisher drops through a glass window and begins shooting up a casino.\n\n&quot;The Punisher&quot; get 2 ½ stars out of 5.",

It tells the very unusual love story between two people with extreme eccentricities. I am still uncertain, considering the year in question, whether they are supposed to be mentally ill or merely &quot;troubled teens&quot;. Keir Dullea (better known, to me, in &quot;2001&quot;) was hardly 17, but at 25 or 26 at the time, his performance and the whole material more than compensated for the obvious adult in the role. The independently produced film comes at the beginning of a long string of films dealing with mental issues. This one reminded me mostly of &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;--or at least the last half of that film. The cinematography is like one Ansel Adams photo after another. Do yourself a favor and watch this film!"

It was indeed interesting to learn about Katy Perry&apos;s off stage life, and on stage life, but the movie sadly dragged it out to much. It was too long for a sort of movie like it was. It, at some parts, got extremely boring. If you love watching movies about singers or actresses lives off and on stage than this movie is for you. But if you don&apos;t like it when they drag movies out and put stuff in there that is extremely pointless than this movie is definitely not for you. Katy Perry: Part of Me was just one of those movies that when nothing else is really on you turn it on and watch it. Of course if you love Katy Perry, then this Katy Perry movie is going to have you glued to the television. I am not a big fan of her, but the movie wasn&apos;t bad, just dragged out.",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those few films I wish would be discussed in more detail, but it fits in such a niche of a market that I doubt it&apos;ll ever happen.\n\nIn the 1970&apos;s, it wasn&apos;t uncommon for Italian B-movies to shoot a few exteriors in New York City but quite rare for the poliziotteschi genre. Sure there&apos;s a few films like STREET PEOPLE, BLAZING MAGNUMS, and STATELINE MOTEL but for the most part tried to play themselves off (unsuccessfully) as American movies.\n\nAs Umberto Lenzi&apos;s only cross-pond crime movie excursion and only teaming with famous Neapolitan crooner Mario Merola, this film stands out for several reasons. One, it&apos;s odd to see a eurocrime movie starring Maurizio Merli so focused on plot and characters. From start to finish, there&apos;s a single narrative thrust and tension running high throughout and even some personal investment on whether the characters live, die, or finally face sweet justice for their transgressions.\n\nSecondly, it&apos;s almost more of a travelogue than an action movie. The film has no less than 4 sequences where characters sit in a car and look around while intercutting to a lot of filler footage of street scenes filmed from a moving car. While this sort of thing usually drags a B-movie down, it oddly fits in with the gritty, trashy feeling this film evokes from the sloppy cinematography and chaotic and funky score by Franco Micalizzi. You can either look at it as a more bizarre, improvised version of a Lenzi movie or a really polished version of an Alfonso Brescia-helmed scungy crime drama.\n\nThat said, there&apos;s plenty about this movie that really doesn&apos;t make sense (unless something was lost in translation). Why does Merli have to escort his witness by rail and car from Palermo all the way to Rome first in order to fly to New York? Surely in 1979 there had to be at least a few direct flights from Palermo to New York, or at least to Rome? Well, if they&apos;d have just hopped on a plane at the start, it wouldn&apos;t have been the same movie. However I&apos;d wager that it could only have been better as the film really picks up the most once it plops macho Italian crimefighter Maurizio Merli on American shores in the snowy, garbage-strewn, hoodlum-infested streets of 70&apos;s NYC.",

      "reviewBody": "For a Japanese comedy and a Third Windows Films release, then &quot;Tsumi Toka Batsu Toka&quot; (aka &quot;Crime or Punishment?!?&quot;) is a fairly tame and flat experience. For a comedy, then it was surprisingly devoid of laughing moments.\n\nThe story is about a young girl posing in a girlie magazine whose life is turned upside-down, literally, as she finds out her photo has been posted upside-down in the magazine. But this is also a tale of various fates coming together.\n\nThe good part about &quot;Crime or Punishment?!?&quot; is that the director, Keralino Sandorovich, actually managed to pull it off with a couple of very different story lines coming together and entwining nicely for a greatly spun story. Each storyline is nicely executed and presented, and is woven into one another in a good way.\n\nActing-wise, then &quot;Crime or Punishment?!?&quot; doesn&apos;t really boast any overly outstanding performances. That being said, don&apos;t get me wrong. I am not saying that the acting in the movie was bad, not at all, it was just plain and ordinary. Which didn&apos;t lift the movie up from the mediocre experience that it turned out to be.\n\nAnd the lack of laughs throughout the movie didn&apos;t exactly help the movie out much either. Sure, there is comedy here and there throughout the movie. But just don&apos;t expect this to by the type of comedy that will leave you in tears from laughing.\n\nThird Window Films have some really good titles to their name, but of course, it would be stupidity to expect every single title they produce will be of equal quality. I was disappointed with &quot;Crime or Punishment?!?&quot;, but hey, this might just be what you are looking for.",

      "reviewBody": "BODY AND SOUL is, like many another ancient talky, not terribly interesting to the modern viewer. Although it tries to say something meaningful about how war forces us to take a carpe diem attitude towards things, its meanings are inserted into a melodramatic plot with few skilled actors. Elissa Landi is very good in her down-to-earth and lady-like attitude towards the boys-will-be-boys standards of the fliers. Yet, dealing, as she must, with Charles Farrell, whose line reading is always overwrought, she seems a bit snide at moments. As the rest of the industry caught up with her, this sort of role would be taken typically by Irene Dunne. The opening up of the original play offers us some good camera-work by Glen MacWilliams, but that isn&apos;t enough to make this worth revisiting.\n\nThe primary reason to see this is to take a look at Humphrey Bogart, so young and good looking, that he is unrecognizable. Because his death in battle sets the plot in motion, he doesn&apos;t get much to do, but he certainly is up to doing it. Myrna Loy is present, still in her exotic villainess phase. Alas, the costume design is not particularly flattering to her, another clear sign that she is a bad &apos;un.",

      "reviewBody": "This is essentially a continuation of TOPPER. It does need to be watched as a part two of the original film otherwise it won&apos;t make sense.\n\nThe humour&apos;s the same, the feel is the same and actually the jokes are the same. That carbon copy formula worked with AIRPLANE and AIRPLANE II and it works with this too. If you enjoyed TOPPER you&apos;ll definitely enjoy this.\n\nThere&apos;s one obvious difference: no Carey Grant . Constance Bennett therefore has to carry this alone and she accomplishes that seemingly without any effort. You don&apos;t miss Mr Grant at all but maybe that&apos;s because since this is so much of a continuation, you still think he&apos;s been in this anyway, just not in the last few scenes.\n\nIt&apos;s a silly story with silly characters but being so professionally made and expertly directed and acted, when you&apos;re watching this, somehow it feels sort of believable or at least it lowers your credibility filter down to level zero.",

There&apos;s a negative review on here that says to go see MICHAEL CLAYTON instead and not to waste your time. Well, if a movie about plot, overly drawn characters and artifice, all shot by the book, is what you&apos;re looking for, then yes... this probably isn&apos;t the movie for you.\n\nBut if you like people more than stories. If you want to see film-making at its most graceful and organic and inventive, if you want a musical score that will turn a sidelong glance into an operatic overture, then this IS the movie for you. It is a baroque masterwork. A cathedral of a film. Cold as stone but inspiring the soul. \n\nTilda Swinton is a goddess. She says so little, but communicates so much. There&apos;s an entire ocean of emotion inside or her, spilling out of her eyes. I cried twice at this film. Once because of the subject matter and then again at the delicacy of the film-making. Don&apos;t let people with conservative tastes and conventional ideas of film and story tell you not to go see this movie. They are robbing you of experiencing pure emotive cinema.",

We got closer and more original glimpses in films that go from Wilder&apos;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; to Altman&apos;s &quot;The Player&quot;. Bernard Rose&apos;s &quot;Ivansextc&quot; also comes to mind not to mention Blake Edwards&apos;s SOB. Here the prototypes are well known even by people who have nothing to do with the film industry so one gets a bit impatient waiting for this fresh look from a prominent, still active, Hollywood producer. No such luck but there are other elements that make the film fun to watch if nothing else. To see Robert De Niro play &quot;a character&quot; that it&apos;s not in any way a semi parody of the films that made him famous is a welcome surprise in itself. Barry Levinson shows that he&apos;s as sharp as ever and the rhythms that he finds to tell the story keeps the tired tale not only alive but almost gripping.",

She lucks into land leases which are ripe for wildcat oil-drilling, quickly taking on her benefactor&apos;s professor son as a partner to combat her main competitor, a wealthy oil baron who owns the land neighboring hers. Brawling, robust tale filmed in rich Technicolor, skillfully written by Curtis Kenyon and Frank Nugent and tightly directed by Stuart Heisler. Hayward is backed solidly by a fine supporting cast, including Robert Preston in a Rhett Butler mustache and Pedro Armendáriz as an Indian kindred spirit whose friendship comes to mean everything in the end. Some of the comedic overtures are corny, and the noisy climax goes on too long; otherwise, an engrossing, entertaining, well-oiled mix of history, romance, ambition, and pride. **1/2 from ****",

      "reviewBody": "The movie is hard to rate. I for one can&apos;t tell if there is some hidden Korean cultural context that I missed, or if that it was faking it. I am leaning towards the latter.\n\nThe movie is about a &quot;soul band&quot; in the seventies called &quot;The Devils&quot; and their existence in post war South Korea. You can in fact apply the formula that most band movies have to this movie. Without spoiling too much, it does have the standard things come full circle ending.\n\nPossibly the biggest problem with the movie was the music. Used are various 60s/70s/pre-disco era American music, which is fine considering context, but the selections aren&apos;t great when couple with the singers, and the songs contribute nothing to the plot. In fact the entire setting is unnecessary, and could have easily taken place in modern day. This makes any importance that music had at that time in South Korea seem trivial and detaches the viewer from the experience of the film.\n\nActing was fine, if a little bit forced. The script wasn&apos;t great, but production was strong and direction was solid. The movie as a whole just didn&apos;t seem to come together very well.",

An uncompromising movie for grownups with two exquisite central performances, and some very nice supporting turns by Clarkson, Hopper and Sarsgaard. What impressed me about this movie is that it dares to be slow, dark, almost meditative. Roth&apos;s short book does not have much plot to it, so that adapting it to the screen runs more risks than would be the case for one of his more developed novels. But the director and screenwriter make a virtue of the book&apos;s spare narrative elements. It takes its time studying faces, glances and shadows. I will be happy if I see another movie half as good this year.",

      "reviewBody": "Revisionist as well as dark version of the medieval tale . Modern recounting in which some Hood aficionados will appreciate the painstaking effort taken to adapt the vintage story to recent times ; including great action scenes with some fun images about the Merry Men . This time in the Sherwood forest , the adventurers inhabitants are amusingly portrayed by agreeable actors . In 13th century England , Robin is a noble Xaxon , he escapes from a nasty baron , the powerful Normand called Roger Daguerre (Jeroen Krabbé who had previously worked with John Irvin in Turtle Diary ,1985) , and the extremely villain Sir Miles Folcanet (Jürgen Prochnow) . Stalwart Robin goes to Sherwood forest where forms his brave band of marauders and confront corruption in the local villages and lead an uprising against Prince John (Edward Fox) and his underlings that will forever alter the balance of world power . Meanwhile , tax collectors brutally invade villages under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes . The legendary Sherwood forest&apos;s hero Robin Locksly and again the graceful Lady Marian (Uma Thurman) along with his Merrie Men , Will Scarlett (Owen Teale) , Friar Tuck (Jeff Nuttal) and Little John (David Morrissey), facing off the really malicious Daguerre and Sir Miles , two extremely crazed , wicked Normands . Later on , they save two kiddies from hanging .\n\nThis well developed movie has great action sequences stunningly staged with stylish and vitality , adventure , romance , poke fun and results to be pretty entertaining . Although is a little revisionist about characters , history , townsfolk , and time when is developed the action in a dirty , gritty Middle Age , as spectators generally disapproved the changes of Robin Hood&apos;s classic canon . Three studios announced plans to remake ¨Robin Hood¨ in 1990 and two were completed , including this one which was scaled down for Cable TV . Nice performances abound , as the politically correct rebel with a cause who battles the bullies , being rightly played by Patrick Bergin . Patrick is very fine as well as Uma Thurman who is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate heroine . Special mention to treacherous Sir Miles , magnetically performed by Jurgen Prochnow and Edward Fox as evil and crazed king in a sensationalistic interpretation as Prince John . Despite some critics&apos; complete and utter distaste for the film , I found it fun , well-acted , and fast-paced . There are great action sequences including the battle into an impressive fortress and the final confrontation at the climax of the film . Impeccable but dark cinematography by Jason Lehel . Although a little shading and foggy , as the sun does not fully shine until the end of the film . Movie is shot on natural sets and English woods , and interior scenarios with impressive production design . Being shot on location in Peckforton Castle , Peckforton , Cheshire , England, UK . Lively and vivid musical score by Geoffrey Burgon . The motion picture was well directed by John Irvin who managed to stage some excellent action scenes , stunning scenarios and clever edition . However , being a flop , though the critics considered one of the best adaptations . John Irvin would later cast Uma Thurman and Edward Fox in another film of his prestigious career , A month by the lake (1995). \n\nOther versions about this famous personage are the followings : ¨Robin Hood¨ (1922) an extravagant silent production by Allan Dawn with Douglas Fairbanks ; the classic rendition is ¨The adventures of Robin Hood¨ by Michael Curtiz with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland. Furthermore , ¨Robin Hood price of thieves (1991)¨ by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman , Michael Wincott and Morgan Freeman , the same year was exhibited this ¨Robin Hood¨ by John Irvin and thus did not receive a theatrical release in the United States . And a hilarious retelling : ¨Robin Hood , men in tights¨(1993) by Mel Brooks with Gary Elwes, Richard Lewis, Roger Rees Amy Yasbeck . Besides , ¨Robin of Locksley¨(1995) by Michael Kennedy with Devon Sawa , Joshua Jackson . Plus , ¨Princess of Thieves¨ by Peter Hewitt with Keira Knightley , Malcolm McDowell and Stuart Wilson . And TV series as ¨Robin Hood¨ produced by Hammer Films with Richard Greene , Peter Cushing , directed by Terence Fisher and ¨Robin Hood , the legend¨ (1995) with Jason Connery , Oliver Cotton , Nickolas Grace and directed by Ian Sharp and Robert M. Young .",

      "reviewBody": "After enduring ten years of hard labor for a crime he did not commit, Gary Hamilton (Klaus Kinski) is given a a presidential pardon (preposterous, but who cares?) and is let out of prison. After ten years of shoveling and smashing rocks in the hot sun there is only one thing on his mind, revenge. Revenge on Acombar, the man who framed him. Gary soon finds out that this same man is now the wealthiest land baron in the territory and is also sleeping with his wife. Gary purchases a rifle and (with what seems to be a never ending supply of bullets) sets out to extract his revenge on Acombar. But before Gary can get to him he must face 30 of Acombar&apos;s bodyguards during a conveniently well timed tornado at night.\n\nAntonio Margheriti (better known as Anthony Dawson or Anthony S. Dawson) returns to his horror roots to direct this suspenseful revenge story. The movie has some fabulous atmosphere. The character of Gary Hamilton is treated as a supernatural by the villains. Wind picks up whenever he appears, animals make strange noises when his name is uttered and his arrival is signified by a threatening Tornando. This all adds to the horror element of the movie (also the fact that a large portion of the film takes place at night).\n\nIt&apos;s a good little western with a few atypical twists. However it doesn&apos;t all go off without a hitch. There is a very nasty pacing problem during the 45 minute storm segment where Hamilton hunts down each and every one of the villain&apos;s gunmen. Hamilton does this by firing from windows then ducking before the return fire reaches him and by firing his rifle from holes on the ground when down in a tunnel system under the town&apos;s buildings. This goes on for quite awhile. I&apos;m sure you can agree with me when I say there is nothing more dull than some prick hiding behind a barrel and randomly picking off people every now and again. I Hate to see that in westerns. It&apos;s alright if it&apos;s used once or twice but when several action scenes are devoted to it for long periods of time something is certainly wrong. \n\nIn it&apos;s defense there are some really creative death scenes, an interesting use of a church bell as a weapon is of particular mention, however there is a severe lack of them overall. Too bad. I also thought that the virtually non-existent tornado should have played a larger role in the film as opposed to making a few cameo appearances as a gust of wind every now and again (they had a nice dust devil effect in &quot;Matalo!&quot;. Why not here?). Perhaps the twister could have taken out a few baddies? mmm? Just a thought.\n\nThe cast is a good one. Kinski stars as the anti-hero Hamilton. It&apos;s almost a sick joke casting Klaus Kinski as a hero. The famous actor played mostly villains throughout his entire career and I have yet to see him playing a good guy in a spaghetti western. I suppose he liked the role because he would usually snag a part where he was on set for as little time as possible for as much money as possible.\n\nPeter Carsten as the greedy Acombar does his job as a slimy no good and the pretty Marcella Michelangeli is unforgivable as Hamilton&apos;s cheating wife.\n\nComposer Carlo Savina makes a good soundtrack here. I really like the title theme.\n\nDespite it&apos;s faults And God Said To Cain is a welcome addition to any spaghetti western library and worth picking up."

      "reviewBody": "As the Professor from the Sorbonne basically states, all the music is very passionate, very well executed, very soulful. The CDs are two long disks of great Jamaican music. The movie adds some visuals, but takes something away from the pure passionate gift of these great performances. Still, its a pretty amazing movie with wall-to-wall great music which exposes all the vast contradictions of the Jamaicans, and really all human groups. Great CD, good movie, great review from the Professor. If you like reggae, gangsta rap, old soul music or music performance movies, you might like this. The movie does have a point of view, and that point of view is not black and white, and twice as interesting because of that. Some of the non-performance settings for the music performance footage are a bit silly, but mostly it all flies by on the wings of great music, and footage of interesting, brilliant folks doing interesting things."

Michelle&apos;s innate sparkle manages to shine through the dowdy clothes and plain-Jane appearance, and yet the miraculous thing is, her casting doesn&apos;t hurt the movie and her performance is one of the best things about &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;. Pfeiffer and Al Pacino are a good screen match, and if they don&apos;t especially resemble the characters they&apos;re playing, they at least don&apos;t throw the tone out of whack (this is a Garry Marshall movie after all, so it&apos;s bound to have a bumpy narrative). Terrence McNally&apos;s play was about hard truths and sex on a low income; this is a big, charming commercial comedy-drama, directed with energy but no real flair. Pacino lays on the Prince Charming-pizazz a bit heavily, and Nathan Lane works overtime at being adorable as the proverbial gay best friend, but it certainly isn&apos;t a bad movie. It works on a certain level, even if it doesn&apos;t resemble reality or the original play. *** from ****",

The subject of children who become a menace has been treated several times in horror cinema(e.g. Village Of The Damned, The Exorcist) because the idea of seemingly-innocent beings hiding dark and murderous forces within them is especially mind-bending and terrifying. Director Ibanez-Serrador (who later became more famous in Spain for directing TV game shows (!)) tries to make the most of this concept, and, although the final result suffers a bit from poor acting and lack of budget, he is altogether quite successful; He intelligently uses a sunny and placid holiday setup which gives us no clue about the horrors we&apos;re about to see, and builds up suspense so the film becomes more and more scary as it advances, reaching really sick heights of dementia towards the end. This is definitely a movie to discover for all Horror-cinema-lovers.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;, I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed. When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point: communication issues. You see, when a dingo snatched Lindy Chamberlain&apos;s (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were grief-stricken but didn&apos;t show it. As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God willed this to happen, and so they couldn&apos;t mourn it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that Lindy did it herself.\n\nThe point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet&apos;s political views.\n\nAs for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably get blown away just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi&apos;s best movies ever.",

Once again he has cast his real-life partner (they have just had a child) Charlotte Gainsbourg as his screen wife and cast fellow triple-threat wda Alain Chabat as his best friend. Whilst Vincent (Attal) and Gabrielle (Gainsbourg) have a seemingly ideal marriage Georges (Chabat) and Nathalie (Emmanuelle Seigner) are more tempestuous and Nathalie&apos;s nagging is ever present. Both couples have a child hence the title, They Were Married And Had Many Children, which is also the French equivalent of the fairy-tale ending &apos;and so they lived happily ever after&apos;. The third man, Fred (Alain Cohen) is single and has no shortage of girls. This is the broad outline. The twist, such as it is requires Fred to envy the married state, Vincent to lead a double life that fools even Georges and Fred and Georges, the logical one to cheat on a nagging wife to be faithful. Most of the five principals are virtually unknown outside France - Chabat appeared in &apos;Le Gout des Autres&apos;, Attal in &apos;Bon Voyage&apos; - but Anouk Aimee who plays Vincent&apos;s mother is certainly known if only for &apos;A Man And A Woman&apos; whilst Berri, of course, directed &apos;Jean de Florette&apos; and &apos;Manon des Sources&apos;. Attal has done a workmanlike job of exploring male bonding - the men spend hours playing football - and precarious relationships and it&apos;s the kind of film that can find an audience abroad. 7/10"

The acting was terrible, the scriptwriting was cliché and the underscore was so poorly produced that a circus would scoff at it. There were very few camera angles, which made viewing uninteresting. There were many scenes where the backgrounds were blurred out which actually distracted me more than if they had not been (I understand this&apos;ll have been to hide business names, but there are better ways to hide that.) The relationship between the main character and his wife was unappealing, and neither were good actors. The &quot;comical scenes&quot; weren&apos;t very funny at all, they were actually so &apos;unfunny&apos; that they were embarrassing to the viewer. Some of the situations were insanely unrealistic and since this is supposed to be a true story, I was confused. I&apos;m sure there was a good, wholesome point to be made, but it was lost somewhere between the cheesy acting and the poor scriptwriting. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this movie to anyone who values good movies!",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d like to know what the purpose was behind the making of this film. The Gacy story would have been served better by a more documentary approach, instead of this weak &quot;grand guignol&quot; version which spends more time focusing on maggots and bad smells than on Gacy and his background. Are we to believe that he&apos;s a psychopath because his dad whacked him around on a fishing trip (and maybe elsewhere)? His married life is brushed over casually (what happened in all the OTHER years of his marriage?), and his business and social life was also given short shrift. Why did he kill the first boy? When did he lose control over his anger and perversion? He&apos;s just a hair-trigger, vulgar and angry guy through the entire film.\n\nBUT HERE&apos;S WHAT BUGS (sic) ME MOST ABOUT THIS FILM...when will L.A. producers realize that other parts of the country look different from California? This story took place in Des Plaines, IL, my wife&apos;s home town. (In fact, Gacy&apos;s last &quot;pickup&quot; was at a store just a few blocks from her house.) In the movie, Gacy&apos;s house and neighborhood look nothing like Chicago. The trees are wrong, the sky is wrong, the other buildings are wrong. They didn&apos;t even get the colors quite right on the Chicago police cars. Worst of all...as in many other Hollywood productions about Chicago...you can actually see MOUNTAINS in the background (during Gacy&apos;s party scene). Hollywood morons need to get out a little more! There is life beyond L.A. (At least they confessed to it in the closing credits.)",

      "reviewBody": "Ruben Galindo is one of those sneaky Mexican exploitation directors who makes quickie-movies for the the American market. The cast is filled with fresh American faces and premise as well as atmosphere are typically US high school-like. Only... the production is entirely Mexican! This technique saves the makers a few extra bucks and the fans of this type of cinema mostly don&apos;t notice the difference anyway. However, what you can&apos;t but notice about &quot;Don&apos;t Panic&quot; is the amateurism. The screenplay makes no sense at all as it attempts to blend the mysteries of the occult (an Ouija-board) with an ordinary high school slasher plot. A group of brainless friends summon a demon (named Virgil...not exactly a petrifying name, if you ask me) and this demon soon after possesses one of the kids. How did this Virgil ended up inside the body of the kid?? Who knows... Why does he think it&apos;s necessary to butcher everyone who joined the Ouija game?? Not explained, neither... There&apos;s no tension and no sense of humor to detect anywhere in the script. Well...at least not intended humor, because the stupidity and incompetence definitely will make you chuckle more than once! Also, if you plan to watch this film, you&apos;re better not allergic to atrocious acting. No matter how hard these teen-actors try, they have no acting skills at all. The best part about &quot;Don&apos;t Panic&quot; is  as usual  the gore! Screaming Mad George went nuts again and literally stuffed this film with repulsive massacre and entire buckets of blood. I&apos;m not an expert but I sincerely doubt that an average human body contains so much blood. Oh well, if it wasn&apos;t for these gory moments, &quot;Don&apos;t Panic&quot; would be completely worthless. In conclusion: this probably is one of the only films ever that feature the hero (supposedly 17 years old) battling evil whilst wearing a ridiculous and utterly childish pajamas. Respect!",

Reminds me of personal religious ideology and arguing and some beliefs as to why Bosnian war happened, who is guilty, why are some bad things happening. Also similar to other including christian religious movies when he says &quot;they are in heaven&quot;. I think this is also topic of possible bad side of religion which is excess of it, wahhabism, jihadism... Funniest but also serious are possible reasons for having bad life such as deserving it, and not being chaste. Bit funny religious excesses which I recognize even today in Sarajevo, but this is like a mild comedy. So lack of action and other genres, but for drama this is good.",

But there was so much more going on. These teenagers first of all seemed so different than American teenagers. They seemed more authentic and more human somehow. It was amazing to see what was asked of them in the raw, behind the scenes, way we are able to see it. The teachers were so dedicated, such good guides, so in love with the youth of the teenagers. The teenagers themselves were transformed and the final product was actually really great. Pina seemed to understand the symbol she embodied, she was a muse and she took the responsibility seriously, pointing past herself to something greater. Not many egos can withstand that but she bore the burden of what she represented very well. She was old and had seen it all in terms of dance yet she was as mesmerized as we were. I felt transported during this movie and afterward, I felt so alive. You can&apos;t ask for more from a movie than that."

As far as Barry&apos;s dreams being too violent for a kid to be having, are you joking?!? Our society today is becoming so numb to violence,and often it film it is gratuitous. But in this film it&apos;s more slap stick humor than anything else. You can&apos;t compare this to any other Chuck Norris film. It is a genre all it&apos;s own. I saw this film as a kid and recently it was on Encore and I watched it again and had a great time. Taken for what it&apos;s worth, this film will make you do a happy dance.",

Now that most OOP&apos;s and other obscure movies are available on DVD I just watched the original Boogeyman 2. Original, cause a few years ago they made Boogeyman and Boogeyman 2. Back to the eighties it was for me. All I could remember from the first movie was that there wasn&apos;t a lot of killings and if they appear they weren&apos;t bloody after all. I also noticed in reviews that this version was a bit of a best off of the first part with some additional scene&apos;s. And it was, all the best parts of the first part are included in this part and sometimes they show the killing twice in different parts through the film. There are more bloodier killings in this one and a lot are seen from first person shots, but they are cheesy. The score is okay too. That&apos;s the reason that I gave it a 3 out of 10. The storyline is terrible, the movie isn&apos;t about anything and you can see things coming from miles away. Wait until the end at the graveyard...can you guess what will happen? So, my conclusion, if you haven&apos;t seen the first part watch this flick, you will have both movies in one.",

      "reviewBody": "I had once borrowed Herzogs Rad der Zeit&quot; (Wheel of Time&quot;), which contained Bells in the Deep&quot; as a bonus. With the main film I was a little disappointed, mainly because I wasn&apos;t very interested in the subject. But, upon realizing that the video-store was already closed, I pushed the DVD back into the player and figured that I might well watch the bonus as well. Now I&apos;m very glad that I did.\n\nI never cared much for religions but rather was interested in the mythology behind the various forms of belief. Don&apos;t expect any deep insight from this documentary. There are no revelations or &quot;ultimate truth&quot; albeit the conclusions that the viewers draw themselves. Herzog was never a director who wanted to push a point on the audience but rather films what is and what he sees and leaves the rest to the viewers own devices.\n\nPrimarily Herzog gives us some astonishing, beautiful images and scenes: people crawling across a frozen lake in order to catch a glimpse of a supposedly lost city (which may or may not have been staged by Herzog, but so what?), a pair of Mongolian musicians and a particularly &quot;harsh&quot; baptism in the orthodox tradition (which, as I fondly remember, made my wife wince). But my personal favorite scene is a bell-player of a local church, a seemingly fragile person, who talks about having been adopted and the pain of not knowing your own origins. Once he starts to manipulate his bells with a series of strings and levers, one can only stare and listen in awe.\n\nSo why did Herzog film all this and what did he want to achieve? Personally, I believe it has to do with Herzogs own background, him being Bavarian, where the people are as arch-catholic as they get, yet where traditions are still deeply rooted in the older pagan-believes and mysticisms (as anybody, who has ever watched a &quot;Perchtnacht&quot;, a night where villagers dress up in demonic masks, can attest). If you have visited rural Bavaria, you may also have noticed how the place is virtually littered with carved, wooden figures of Jesus, each seemingly trying to outdo the next in terms of the figure looking bloodied and battered. I&apos;ve overheard tourists you considered it slightly &quot;obscene&quot; to have so many corpses all over the place, but perhaps it has something to do with the old Germanic god Wotan, who crucified himself on an oak in order to receive wisdom.\n\nHaving watched the documentary again with an American friend, I also found it rather amusing that he considered those Russian believes and superstitions rather outlandish, even calling &quot;Bells in the Deep&quot; a &quot;freak-show&quot;. It never occurred to him to look at the many strange paths that various sects and cults in the USA had taken, be it Mormons, Baptists, reborn Christians, Creationists, etc., and traditions like handling snakes and speaking in tongues. None of this would look less outlandish than the Russian practices to an outsider.\n\nIf there is any message behind &quot;Bells in the Deep&quot; it is that religion doesn&apos;t shape traditions and cultures as much as traditions and cultures shape religions. If you feel the need to take a message from this documentary, that is. If not, you might as well just lean back and enjoy the marvelous images.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, what a movie. Far away from Hollywood, Jim Jarmusch creates a world where you don&apos;t need drama, pathos and action to fascinate the watcher. Because fascinating is exactly what this movie is. A plot in the classical sense is almost completely missing; the scenes, in their simplicity sometimes reminding of theater, follow each other without ever creating real suspense; neither griping action nor complex dialogues are there to excite the spectator. And still, with ease Jarmusch fills more than a hundred minutes with a story you won&apos;t take your eyes off. It is hard to tell what the atmosphere of the movie is really based on, the characters, the setting, entirely in black and white, the music - probably all of it. Again, like in Jarmusch&apos;s later movie &quot;Dead man&quot;, speed is an important factor: everything moves slowly, without haste, as there is no dramatic climax you could hurry towards; yet, boring is a word that certainly doesn&apos;t fit this piece of cineastic art. On the other hand, though some of the scenes seem quite surrealistic, it is not a really artistic movie breaking with all the traditional concepts of filmmaking; it is more a movie in classic shape with an unconventional story, not trying to shock, to confuse or even to make you think so much; this movie doesn&apos;t need all this to get your complete attention. You could probably speculate a lot about the meaning of the movie; to me, this seems highly unnecessary. Just let it unfold its atmosphere. Judge yourselves, but I was excited in a very special way by every scene of this motion picture, giving me one of my best cineastic experiences of the recent time.",

      "reviewBody": "Made in 1934 by the then 30 year old Director Edgar Ulmer and with the stunning set design by Charles D. Hall the film paired Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi for the first time together on the screen. This was to cement the two icons together in a screen partnership that would last for several years. \n\nSet in the modern house of Hjalmar Poelzig (no creepy old castle&apos;s here) whose home is one of the most stunning modern houses of our time this is a dark story about Devil worship. Poelzig has a room set aside for his evil black masses and has a penchant for the ladies, but only when they are being put to the devil&apos;s business. Into this walks a young couple who due to circumstances out of their control end up having to stay the night at his home. They arrive with Dr.Verdegast (Lugosi) who is returning after a absence of many years to settle some unfinished business with his old friend. This is the set up for an explosive encounter between the two into which the young honeymooning couple are thrown. \n\nTruly a masterpiece it should be viewed over and over again.\n\nWatch out for the finale Black Mass in which Karloff spout&apos;s authentic sounding incantation&apos;s to raise the Devil, he says Latin phrases &quot;Cave Canium&quot; (Beware of the Dog), &quot;In Vito Veritas&quot; (In Wine there if truth) and Cum Grano Salis (with a grain of salt). I could&apos;nt put it better myself."

The zombies look more like natives of the island, though, but then think of it as a cannibal movie without the scenes of eating. Eventually, a surviving group makes it to a house, and they meet up with this old guy. There are some weird subplots, but ignore them if you like. Not too much gore at all, but a lot of fun.

      "reviewBody": "I can appreciate that there is a limited quantity of movies being made that specifically speak to the LDS market. I am even willing to say that the social history of the church (most poignantly in Utah County, Utah) has room for humor. However it didn&apos;t take any longer than thirty seconds into this film to see that this movie was a culmination of bad ideas getting together, inbreeding, and giving birth to other retarded bad ideas. This movie serves one purpose, and that is to ensure that all other movies made from here on out will be better than this. The dialogue and situations that are so quickly rehashed in the opening scenes should be a warning to you that Singles 2nd ward is without a doubt the worst movie HaleStorm has crapped out since the first time Kurt Hale said action.\n\nThe main &quot;couple&quot; in this film demonstrate what lack of chemistry can do to ruin what appears to be two otherwise capable and fairly attractive actors. After Kirby&apos;s acceptable performance in Saints and Soldiers, his reprisal of this nerdy, lovable, and socially naive guy from the first movie changes to a plausibly more mellow and grounded return missionary that has nowhere to go as far as character development. The choice of dramatic tension comes from a completely unnatural set of circumstances that were obviously written by someone who has spent so little time outside of &quot;happy valley&quot; that its almost as if human nature was never even a backdrop for how this story was supposed to climax.\n\nSeriously-production team, are LDS people as 2 dimensional as this movie portrays? Is that how you view your potential audience?\n\nIn the end, what should have been a redeeming quality of the DVD, such as the deleted scenes and out-takes, ended up serving to further show the poor decision making abilities of the writer/director/producers. The deleted scenes had some of the best material. I actually laughed at the bar-b-cue scene between the two fathers of the betrothed couple. It was the best scene of the movie. Instead of enjoying it, I wondered what prompted them to leave that out of the movie and to leave in the random pieces of drivel that made the cut?\n\nSo in other words, I watched the movie and was disappointed. Then I watched the extra features and was further disappointed as the poor decision making continued by taking out the good parts. Just when I thought things couldn&apos;t be worse, they just got depressing. Is this the future of HaleStorm? Does this represent their best work? A straight to DVD release drowning the viewer in visual ipecac? No thanks. Please no trilogy!\n\nThe only reason a project like this was green lighted for production was because there is a big enough audience to, in lemming like fashion, trickle to your LDS friendly retailer and subscribe to the notion that you are supporting a good cause. Just because it is LDS doesn&apos;t mean it has to be less entertaining than staring at dust gathering.\n\nViewers of LDS media, please stop supporting this type of insult to intelligence and encourage the creators of this film to achieve what they are really capable of doing, and that is good honest work. Taking this straight to DVD release and using it as toilet paper is about the only use this movie will have. As far as entertaining and in uplifting your mind and heart to the powerful stories the gospel CAN have, this movie will make you want to repent for wasting what precious time we have on this earth on such light mindedness.",

      "reviewBody": "Flypaper is an unconventional &apos;whodunit&apos; in the form of a screwball comedy. It starts off with a guy named Tripp (played by Patrick Dempsey) who walks into a bank to get some change and ends up in the middle of two simultaneous bank robberies, executed by two different gangs, one of whom highly professional, the other one very much the opposite. What follows is an idiotic muddle of story lines and plot twists, which overall is pretty funny and at times even hilarious. \n\nFlypaper&apos;s biggest asset is its wild array of stereotype characters, which certainly doesn&apos;t always work out, but in this case does so very well, mostly because of the clever writing. The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the way the characters are played out against one another is really the stuff of great comedies. One of the best characters is one called Peanut Butter, played by the great Tim Blake Nelson, who, together with his buddy Jelly forms a duo of laughably amateurish hillbilly bank robbers. The other team of (professional) bank robbers is set together of another great group of stereotypes, namely The Black Guy, The Jewish Guy and The British Guy (not their actual character names, just pointing it out), which in itself sounds like a &quot;three guys walk into a bar&quot; joke, and it actually works out funnier than you might expect. And then there&apos;s the group of hostages (all bank employees), all with their own crazy little character traits, paranoia and strange ulterior motives, more afraid of each other than of the people robbing their bank.\n\nI must admit, I didn&apos;t have great expectations for Patrick Dempsey, but he pleasantly surprised me with his knack for timing and delivery. His character is a completely hyper-active genius, brilliant with numbers and facts, dead-set on solving the strange mysteries that keep piling up in the bank as the robberies go on, and Mr Dempsey plays his role convincingly. Who knew McDreamy had a serious sense of humour. Ashley Judd is a reliable actress, and she can really deliver some good comedy too. But I have to mention one thing: it&apos;s really such a shame that all these actresses (who were never bad looking to begin with) have succumbed to the pressures of botox and fillers. She has a really pretty face, but now that she&apos;s obviously had some work done, her eyes look puffy and something overall just doesn&apos;t look right. The reason I say this is because it gets in the way of her acting, making her expressions a little screwy a times, and this somewhat ruins the experience when she&apos;s trying to deliver a certain emotion. And even in a light-hearted comedy, this can work against the quality of someone&apos;s performance. It&apos;s too bad, but fortunately Ms Judd still has plenty of talent to make up for it. Actually, all the actors are really good in their roles, they&apos;re none of them really big names, but obviously, that&apos;s not saying anything. There&apos;s only one case of miscasting, and that&apos;s Mekhi Phifer. He&apos;s a very fine actor, but obviously more suited for serious roles. He took his role way too seriously, maintaining a poker face even when everybody around him was acting like a goon. And even when he was seemingly trying to be funny, he didn&apos;t really deliver. So, no more comedies for you, Mekhi.\n\nStory wise, Flypaper basically unfolds as an increasingly intricate game of &quot;Clue&quot;, at one point even bearing some resemblance to a funny version of The Usual Suspects. The plot starts out pretty much literally thin as flypaper, but thickens throughout, without getting ridiculously over thought. The story has some inconsistencies throughout, but they&apos;re hardly any bother. And the ending is kind of a cliché, but let&apos;s face it, have you ever played &quot;Clue&quot; without saying &apos;I knew it all along!&apos; at the end? Right. There&apos;s nothing that actually spoils the fun at any point. This is a semi-dark, adult comedy, with a healthy dose of profanity and crude humour, though innocent like a baby compared to Tarantino or Ritchie. Speaking of which, I sometimes got the feeling that director Rob Minkoff watched these two very closely and took notes, considering some camera techniques and directorial gimmicks he threw in here and there, which is OK up to some level, but not when your film starts to look like a silly rip-off (Snatch comes to mind...). Fortunately, Flypaper manages to keep true to a style of its own, simply &apos;borrowing&apos; some inspiration from other great crime comedies. And there&apos;s nothing wrong with that.\n\nOverall, Flypaper is an entertaining Sunday evening-filler, somewhere in between indie and low-budget Hollywood. It may be somewhat forgettable but it&apos;s surely good enough to keep you in your seat from start to finish, and I would certainly recommend it for an evening of good fun.",

I don&apos;t know why I wanted to see this movie, just I figured I needed a romantic comedy in my selection, so I just grabbed it and even after that rating I thought this was going to be a bad movie. But as it turns out this really wasn&apos;t a bad movie at all. Yeah, it has minor flaws here and there, this isn&apos;t movie of the year, but over all I would say that it was pretty cute.\n\nMarisa is a single mom in Manhattan who is a working maid in one of the top hotels. She is also up for a big promotion as a manager and is hoping to help her fellow employees. When she and a co-worker are just fooling around and wondering what it&apos;s like to try on over 5,000 dollars worth of clothes, Marisa gets caught by a politician who her son is excited to meet. She has to convince him that nothing can happen between them without letting him know what she did and who she really is, but it might be too strong of a connection for both of them to let go so easily.\n\nMaid in Manhattan is predictable and I think Marisa&apos;s character wasn&apos;t really as developed as I would like her to be because she came off as kinda rude and judgmental. But over all, I wouldn&apos;t say this is a 4.5 rated movie, I think people were probably just jumping on the movie because it is Jennifer Lopez, I would agree, I&apos;m not into her either, but I can&apos;t resist if I do like a movie or not and I wanna be honest if I like a movie. So please just give the movie a shot if you&apos;re looking for a sweet romantic comedy.\n\n5/10",

It&apos;s both an exploration of how a family survives and recovers in the wake of a loss, and how a teen who&apos;s got no choice but to make her own decisions gains her own sensibilities and independence as a human being. Dealing with an apathetic father who appears to have given up and a hostile sister who&apos;s not mature enough to be without guidance, she finds a way to come to terms with the family tragedy and her own sense of loss, and finds her strength and, in doing so, provides a focus for healing. The director&apos;s creativity was constrained by the industry to produce a film of 50 minutes and did a remarkable job of exploring the circumstances and personalities involved with surprising depth. All the actors did a great job of portraying their characters; they were believable and it was possible to be empathetic even if they weren&apos;t the most likable groups of people you could meet. I rated it a 5 out of 5 in the audience survey and look forward to seeing it again.",

      "reviewBody": "The Titanic was to be the greatest ship ever made, a veritable city on the sea moving between England and New York. Made in Belfast, the ship travels to England before its maiden voyage, which it makes loaded with over 2,100 people ranging from the richest gentlemen in first class down to those in stowage seeking a new life in America. However, a series of errors and oversights result in the Titanic striking an iceberg and ripping a gash along the side below the water level. As the &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship starts to fill with water the shortcomings of having only 1200 lifeboat spaces sinks in.\n\nIt has become very fashionable now to hate James Cameron&apos;s Titanic and it is the norm now, not only to prefer this film but to actively hate the 97 film in any review of other versions! I&apos;m not a fan of the rather bloating modern film but I will refrain from making this review about that film and will focus on the one I&apos;ve just seen. The first thing you notice here is how quickly the film moves and, after only a very brief introduction to the characters we are underway and hitting the ice. Shorn of romantic subplots and heart-tugging sweeping scores this is a very good approach and it simply lets the facts of the event and the real horror speak for themselves. In the remake we were supposed to get our emotional attachment to one or two characters based on their love for one another; here the film respects our humanity enough to know that we will be touched by the sheer number who died and the manner of their death. This works much better and it is genuinely eerie to see that large ship slip below the surface to a barrage of screams from unseen thousands  that the effects are not as good doesn&apos;t matter because they are good enough and the emotional impact more than covers for them.\n\nThis is not to say that the film lacks characters because you do tend to care for everyone and the film did very well in delivering little things without getting in the way of the rather documentary style form. The horror of the death is as well told as the horror of those watching it occur from the lifeboats; I liked the guilt of the designer and the guilt of the men who climbed into the lifeboats etc, these little touches work much better than inserting large fictional sections. With this sort of performance the actors do well  all realistic with none really upstaging the film with ham. Moore is a good lead and only at the end is his delivery a bit flat  but that is more the fault of a wordy conclusion. The rest of the cast do very well with realistic performances of fear even if they are being directed into generic class groups  simple but, with the delivery of the material, it works.\n\nOverall, to me this is the best telling of the Titanic disaster that I have seen. The factual approach is consistently interesting and, without our attentions being directed to one or two people, the emotional impact is greater than I expected and I was quite chilled by the whole thing. For those irritated and put off by the sweeping sentimentality of the modern version, this film is the one for you."

      "reviewBody": "Before stepping into acting this was Sohail&apos;s first directorial movie. But it did flop with an immature story, old plots and over-action scenes. Yes though it can be considered as movie for commercial purposes but many bugs and small mistakes are visible while watching it. From Anu Malik&apos;s side it was a good effort to present good and ear-relaxing music. That&apos;s why the songs are not that negligible, and are worth listening. Exceptional to one song &apos;Dil Le Lena&apos; which he entirely copied from Macarena by Los Del Rio.\n\nI like Auzaar only for the story of Suraj (Salman) and Yash (Sanjay) who are good friends and can do anything for their strong friendship sake. Only difference is that Suraj is from a village and Yash is from a rich (criminal) father. Also Yash has a girlfriend Prathna (shilpa), while Suraj remains bachelor till the end of the movie. Suddenly in between their friendship story Suraj leaves for his village. He returns with a secret mission and hiding his identity from all. What is that secret mission and his identity?\n\nThe movie can be considered as &apos;zabardast masaladar&apos; but again with too much &apos;masala&apos; also spoils the recipe. Such is the case with Auzaar. Only tasty while watching it, but forget after it gets end. Sometimes it&apos;s hard to digest. Paresh Rawal is always evergreen for every role he is offered, and here also it is not exceptional. His role as Yash&apos;s handicapped father is excellent, which proves that he is fit for every role beside comedian.\n\nA great regret for Sohail is that his first directorial debut went in vain without success. He improved better with his second movie Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya which was somewhat delicious.",

      "reviewBody": "What a wacky plot. Broderick is hired to convey illegally imported endangered species by Brando, playing Carmine (&quot;Jimmy the Toucan&quot;) Sabatini, in order to provide million-dollar-a-plate dinners for a bunch of international degenerates who revel in eating forbidden fruit, or in this instance lizards. It&apos;s the kind of plot you dream up while sitting around all night half-gassed with a couple of buddies who have a good sense of the absurd.\n\nBroderick is Clark Kellog (whom Sabatini calls &quot;Kent&quot;), a naif just in from Vermont to attend film school at NYU. Sabatini is the &quot;importer&quot; he works for and a ringer for &quot;The Godfather.&quot; (The original was almost a self parody.) Those are the principal roles and Broderick handles the role of straight man, being sucked into a Mafia-like existence, competently. Brando is unforgettable. He tried one or two comedies before and they tanked, but he&apos;s a winner here, cracking walnuts in his fist, weeping with emotion as he embraces his new employee.\n\nBut it&apos;s not just the relationship between Clark and Sabatini that&apos;s amusing. It&apos;s also just about everything in between, including what we see of the film school, where the professor assigns seven hundred dollars worth of his own books as required reading, and is working on a paper that will combine -- what was it? -- Plato, Marx, and semiotics in a deconstruction of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, or something equally insane? Maximilian Schell is a much under-rated or unnoticed actor. He consistently turns in riveting performances but has never achieved major stardom. It doesn&apos;t matter whether it&apos;s drama (&quot;Judgment at Nurenberg&quot;), comedy thrillers (&quot;Topkapi&quot;), or, as in this case, comedy. He never fails to bring something extra to the role. His first entrance here knocks the whole situation askew. Clark has enlisted a fellow student to help him carry this giant lizard (Varanus komodoensis -- they pronounce the specific name wrong) and a bearded sunglassed Schell ambles into the scene during the delivery, fondling a ferret, looks up with a big smile, and says, &quot;Sabatini said one boy.... Here are two!&quot; Clark runs through his explanation while Schell listens politely before replying, &quot;Sabatini said one boy.... Here are two!&quot; He says it a third time before ambling off. That&apos;s ALL he says.\n\nI&apos;ve seen this about three times since I first commented on it and, although this is anything but a &quot;deep&quot; movie, I&apos;ve continually found things, mostly jokes, that I&apos;d missed earlier. I must give a few examples.\n\nNever before had I noticed some particular details in the scene in which Brando cracks the walnuts. I had just seen him cracking walnuts. More recently I&apos;ve noticed that in this scene Brando, apparently dead serious, tells Broderick that he wants him to accept the job offer. &quot;I don&apos;t want to hear &apos;no&apos;, I want to hear &apos;yes.&apos;&quot; And that, immediately after these lines, while Broderick is pondering an answer, Brando picks up TWO walnuts, rolls them in his palm, and slowly but noisily CRACKS them.\n\nAnd another of the many allusions to &quot;The Godfather&quot; finally registered on my interpretive apparatus. As the end credits begin to roll, Broderick and Brando are taking the monitor for a walk through the cornfields in long shot. And we can hear Brando&apos;s voice offering Broderick some career assistance. &quot;Y&apos;know, Clark, when you get out to Hollywood, maybe I can help you.&quot; &quot;No, please.&quot; &quot;It wouldn&apos;t take much. Just a few phone calls.&quot; &quot;NO!&quot; &quot;I could kick open a few doors for you.&quot; The penny finally dropped and I could see Brando arranging to have a lopped-off horse head planted in some producer&apos;s bed.\n\nJust a few other points. One is that the score owes something to &quot;The Stunt Man.&quot; Another is that Brando seems so perfectly comfortable in this self parody. He seems to be genuinely enjoying himself. His body language is exquisite. He lolls around in his chair, sticks his tongue in his cheek (literally), waves his hands, shrugs, and does everything else flawlessly. Sometimes his whiskery voice gets away from the Don Corleone model. I don&apos;t think Vito Corleone would be so indignant when talking about Polaroid and IBM on the phone. &quot;I told you before, Charlie, I don&apos;t LIKE it when they go DOWN. Listen. I had another stock broker once and he only called me with bad news. It got very UNPLEASANT, Charlie, y&apos;unnerstand me?&quot;\n\nAnd anyone who thinks of the later Brando as a bloated hypocrite who has lost whatever acting chops he once had should take another look at the scene in which he visits Broderick in the college dorm room. Broderick, at Brando&apos;s own request, recites a poem written by his father, a rather elliptical one, and Brando&apos;s character picks it up immediately -- &quot;Ah, the cat.&quot; And the discussion about Curious George. And Brando&apos;s momentary melancholy as he looks around the college dorm, an environment as alien to him as the planet Neptune, shrugs and comments, &quot;Well, I didn&apos;t miss nuthin&apos;.&quot; It isn&apos;t funny. It&apos;s touching. \n\nI thought this movie was very funny and quite original, considering the stale material it was sending up, and I still think so. Two years&apos; worth of additional viewings hasn&apos;t changed things. You must see it, if only to hear Bert Parks sing &quot;I ain&apos;t gonna work on Maggie&apos;s farm no more.&quot;",

The great joke in the original film where a teenage secret agent has to get close to a professor&apos;s daughter but proves to be completely clueless around women has been junked here and all we are left with is the standard teenage secret agent story. That wouldn&apos;t matter so much if we had a great story and great characters but we don&apos;t.\n\nSetting it in London would have been a great idea if they had bothered to look beyond the standard cliché English eccentric characters but they don&apos;t. This is lazy writing of the highest order (yes, Don Rhymer, I mean you) and throws away every opportunity the setting gives for the story. Why not some cultural misunderstanding between Cody and the English, for instance? Or their disbelief that he is a secret agent. I know this isn&apos;t supposed to be taken seriously but this could have been a lot funnier than it is. Instead we get the typical English eccentrics so beloved of Hollywood.\n\nStill, I must confess that the revelation during the concert at Buckingham Palace at the film&apos;s finale that Tony Blair is under mind control from an evil mastermind did make me laugh, even though it takes the film dangerously close to realism, something that doesn&apos;t occur again throughout the rest of the film (the Blair look-a-like (and sound-a-like) is great though - give that man a medal. For a minute, I was thinking it was the real thing. After his appearance in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, I was beginning to think that maybe Blair was starting to line up a new career for himself for when he gets kicked out of Downing Street).\n\nAnd if I say that the only person not to disgrace themselves in this film is Hannah Spearritt, then you may some clue about how bad the performances are. Paul Kaye (a.k.a. Dennis Pennis) gives a career-truncating performance as an eccentric Q-type character while Anna Chancellor gets stuck with another posh English woman role after her turn in &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; (What has this poor woman done to upset her agent? That&apos;s what I want to know), Anthony Anderson manages to make his previous performance in &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; look a masterpiece of subtlety by comparison and David Kelly is embarrassing as an eccentric butler (a shame as he&apos;s usually quite good, as anyone who&apos;s seen &quot;Waking Ned&quot; will testify). As for Hannah Spearritt, she makes an appealing easy on-the-eye replacement for Hilary Duff and isn&apos;t half bad as the flautist/covert agent, especially given the paucity of the material she was to work with. Given a decent script, she might find herself a career outside of S-Club 7 but after this and the S-Club 7 movie &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, like Anna Chancellor, she needs to get herself a new agent first (perhaps she shares the same one as Anna Chancellor). To think this travesty was directed by an Englishman (Kevin Allen) defies belief (what was he thinking of? The pay cheque?). Avoid (like the plague), I beg you!!!"

      "reviewBody": "I guess you could say that this first sequel to PLANET OF THE APES is a nostalgic pleasure for me; I got hooked on it as a child and while I still think it&apos;s an interesting followup to the original, as an adult I&apos;m naturally more aware of its flaws. Yet it still works out as a good adventure film; less of a cerebral experience like PLANET OF THE APES, and more of a comic book story.\n\nJames Franciscus plays astronaut Brent, sent along the same trajectory as Taylor&apos;s (Charlton Heston&apos;s) old ship in an effort to rescue him. He crash-lands in the same vicinity as his friend, and goes through a similar nightmare when he comes to discover that the planet he&apos;s stranded on is dominated by intelligent, talking apes with a decidedly low opinion of mankind. General Ursus (James Gregory) is a war-hungry gorilla leader who&apos;s anxious to investigate strange unearthly occurrences in the Forbidden Zone with the aid of the ever-skeptical scientist Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans in a reprisal of his role from Part One). Luckily, Brent runs into Taylor&apos;s mate, Nova (Linda Harrison looking prettier than she did in PLANET) and she is able to lead him to kindly chimpanzee couple, Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (David Watson this time; Roddy McDowall was busy directing a film). The pacifistic simians try to help their human friends along their journey to find Taylor, but Brent and Nova only succeed in getting themselves captured by gorillas anyway.\n\nUp to this midway point in the film, all we&apos;re really seeing is a rehash of the first APES movie, which feels obligatory to set up the scenario. Where this chapter starts to develop its own identity and really take off is in its second half, as Brent and Nova escape and find themselves going underground (literally) in the Forbidden Zone and discovering the ruins of a ravaged city, along with a community of radiation-scarred mutations who have mastered mental telepathy and worship an atomic bomb as their god who has &quot;created&quot; them. And they know it won&apos;t be long before the Ape Army will invade their sanctuary.\n\nCharlton Heston felt that sequels were not very challenging for an actor in those days, so at first he resisted appearing in this movie. He eventually agreed on what gradually evolved into a more extended &quot;cameo&quot; in BENEATH as a favor to Richard Zanuck, since the producer had taken a gamble on making the original film when Heston asked him to. The resulting sequel can be a downbeat and unusually pessimistic viewing experience, but in an odd way that actually helps to work in its favor. The next entry was ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES (1971). *** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "Let me begin by saying that I hated this film as a kid. After viewing it the other day on a whim however, I was surprised at how much better I liked it now. The story centers around an evil mask-maker planning to use ancient technology to murder millions of children on Halloween night by selling them masks with a nasty little secret inside. I found the story very interesting, though plenty of plot holes ultimately keep this film from being all it could have been. \n\nThe biggest obstacle in this film&apos;s way is the fact that it has nothing at all to do with the other &quot;Halloween&quot; films made either before or after it. That&apos;s certainly no reason not to give it a chance, though. Perhaps it should have been called only &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; or something so as not to anger the purists out there who demand the presence of Michael Myers in anything with the word &quot;Halloween&quot; in the title. That said, let&apos;s take a look at the good and not-so-good elements of this film, shall we?\n\nLike the previous entries in the series, this film has some creepy and effective music. It is also buffered by some evil synthesizer sounds at every turn. The little jingle set to &quot;London Bridge&quot; is annoying, and I&apos;m sure it was supposed to be. \n\nThere are some interesting deaths, to say the least. Early on, we see a robotic henchman pull apart a victim&apos;s skull, then blow himself up in a car. One hapless woman gets an energy beam projected through her face, leaving her mouth much larger than normal. (a bug then crawls out of her head, foreshadowing later events) Another man gets his head ripped completely off for threatening to torch the bad guy&apos;s factory. Later on, a family is murdered in a test demonstration of what happens when someone wearing one of these masks watches a certain commercial on TV. Bugs and poisonous snakes form inside the mask and attack anyone in the room. It seems the masks have some tiny pieces from one of the blocks from Stonehenge implanted in the factory seal. Something about the commercial triggers the effect within the mask. And just how does this happen, you ask? &quot;A good magician never explains,&quot; the mask-maker points out in one scene. Sigh.\n\nSome gigantic holes are present as the story unfolds. Tom Atkins, who plays our hero, has a useless love affair with the daughter of an early victim. If these two are so intent on solving a deadly mystery about the death of her father, and bad guys are all around, would they really stop to have sex? He is also much older than this woman. I guess since Atkins plays a doctor, the young woman finds that sexy. Maybe I&apos;d better go to medical school if I want to score with hot young women when I&apos;m his age. \n\nAnother problem concerns the time that these masks are supposed to go off. We are told by the mask maker that when the commercial airs at 9:00 pm on Halloween night, all the masks will react and kill the children. However, if it&apos;s 9:00 in California (where this takes place) it would be 11:00 where I live or midnight on the east coast. Children would mostly be in bed by then! Few parents would allow their kids up that late to watch any &quot;big give-a-way&quot;. The plan is to wipe out kids all over the country, but it looks like only kids on the west coast would be up when the commercial airs. If there was an explanation about how this problem would be overcome, I missed it. I guess once again, &quot;A good magician never explains.&quot;\n\nAnd just how in the hell did this guy steal a piece of Stonehenge, anyway? He admits it was difficult, but again offers no explanation of how it was done!\n\nAnd how many freaking times did the female robot attack Atkins at the end? I lost count. \n\nWell, it&apos;s not a total loss. It was a neat idea for a film, but they shouldn&apos;t have glossed over so many things. \n\nI&apos;ll give it 5 of 10 stars. \n\nHappy Happy Halloween Halloween Halloween Happy Happy Halloween Silver Shamrock!\n\nSTOP IT!!!! STOP IT!!!! STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo sayeth the Hound.",

Thrillers without twists are in minority nowadays, so the twists are expected. The twists in this movie did not really surprise me, but maybe it&apos;s just me.\n\nJapanese thrillers usually contain too much melodrama; Amalfi is no exception. However, when a thriller like Suspect X manages to integrate the melodrama organically into the plot, Amalfi does not do such a good job.\n\nThe movie is set in Italy, and at times focuses too much on the settings. Incidentally, much of the action occurs in the well-visited tourist spots, and it makes the movie look like a travel agency brochure, &quot;Top 10 places in Italy to visit&quot;, adapted for Japan, accompanied by &quot;Time to say goodbye&quot; sung by non-Italian Sarah Brightman. Too cheesy.\n\nOn the up side, however, the mystery keeps you interested for a while, and the acting is more or less convincing. Watchable for those interested in Japanese movies (like myself), but no more than that.",

      "reviewBody": "At a time when most of Marvel Comics&apos; characters were stuck in low budget TV and straight-to-video productions, Steve Gerber&apos;s relatively obscure Howard the Duck got the big budget treatment with none other than George Lucas as producer. The film was written by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who co-wrote &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, and directed by Huyck, with special effects by ILM. What could go wrong?\n\nA lot, apparently. &quot;Howard&quot; was a critical and financial failure that deep-sixed the careers of Huyck and Katz and led to the cancellation of the duck&apos;s magazine. If the film had a moderately priced budget, it might have been forgotten as just another lightweight, trashy 1980s comedy and even turned a profit. Instead, the budget somehow ballooned to a then staggering $37,000,000 (almost as much as the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy cost to make). Although other films lost more money and got worse reviews, the name &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; is still synonymous with &quot;expensive turkey&quot;.\n\nThat said, the movie itself isn&apos;t as bad as it&apos;s reputation suggests. The plot revolves around the title character (voice by Chip Zien, played by various midgets in animatronic duck suits), a sarcastic talking duck from a planet a lot like Earth, except ducks evolved into the dominant life form. Howard is brought to Cleveland, Ohio when an experimental laser beam opens an interdimensional portal. There he befriends an aspiring rock singer (Leah Thompson) and a kooky lab assistant (Tim Robbins), and comes into conflict with various lowlifes, the police, and an evil demon that has possessed the body of a helpful scientist (Jeffrey Jones), all the while trying to get back home.\n\nGerber&apos;s original comic book series and a subsequent adult-oriented magazine weren&apos;t kids&apos; stuff. They juxtaposed a funny animal character with bizarre villains and action more typical of Marvel&apos;s super-hero books, usually parodying comics, politics, and popular culture in the process. A sexual relationship between Howard and his human girlfriend Beverly was more than just implied. The &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; movie could have either toned down the more adult situations to create a family-friendly action-comedy, or gone straight for ribald satire and gotten an &quot;R&quot; rating. Instead, the filmmakers sought an uncomfortable middle ground that pleases no one. The script is not witty enough for adults and it is too sleazy and scary for young children. The endless duck puns become tiresome. There are, however, a few truly funny moments, such as Howard&apos;s shock at being served eggs, or his observation that &quot;If God intended ducks to fly, he wouldn&apos;t have taken away our wings.&quot;\n\nThe direction is uneven. The reaction of several characters to meeting a talking alien duck seems muted given the circumstances. The special effects are also hit and miss. The animatronic duck suit cost millions, but the actors inside it add little personality. They could have at least waddled when they walked. The demonic Dark Lords of the Universe at the end of the film are portrayed with stop motion animation that is jerky and unrealistic even for the time (perhaps this was intentional, though, to provide a B-movie feel). However, while a bad movie all around, &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; at least stands out for its unique premise. Amidst a sea of formulaic mediocrity, an original idea, even if it&apos;s poorly developed, counts for something.\n\n** out ****"

The stories often look a lot like each other and &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; isn&apos;t any different, but that doesn&apos;t bother. This is a fine movie! \n\nI don&apos;t know if Edward James Olmos&apos; Academy Award nomination was a big surprise at the Oscars or if his performance was indeed one of the 5 best performances of 1988, but I can only confirm that he gave a great performance. Funny, smart and touching as well. I think all the students were great as well, even so I didn&apos;t knew any of them, except from Lou Diamond Philips of course.\n\n&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; might not be the most original movie ever made, but that doesn&apos;t change the fact that it&apos;s highly enjoyable to watch. The story is good and the performances are great. Nor melodramatic, neither comic, just excellent Saturday night entertainment without being cheap. Worth watching! \n\n8/10",

Even more troubling is the apparent treatment of sexual assault as a source of humor. This is a sensitive topic that should be handled with care and respect, but it seems that the filmmakers have chosen to use it as a cheap punchline. This is not only offensive, but it also trivializes a serious issue. Our hero is an overpowered cowboy, to whom no harm can ever come. Might as well have made into a short film, but even making it a short film would b too gratuitous than this thing deserves.",

To make matters worse, he&apos;s not the only comedian whose considerable talents are wasted on this predictable mess; Ethan Suplee and Seann William Scott, two of the funniest men alive, have nearly nothing to do with their characters. Speaking of predictability, here&apos;s a cliché for you: Seen the trailer? Then you&apos;ve seen the movie. Just about every truly funny part was crammed into the commercials.\n\nI love Bad Santa and all, but it has really done more harm than good seeing as another Thornton-acts-like-a-sociopath-and-gets-away-with-it &quot;comedy&quot; gets released every year. He is an amazing actor and totally wasted on these forgettable carbon copies. I&apos;m not denying that I laughed a couple of times (&apos;cause let&apos;s face it, Thornton abusing kids is funny by default) but in the end Woodcock is just a half-baked comedy-drama which is neither hilarious nor touching.",

      "name": "How could one profit from gay outcasts?",
      "reviewBody": "Can homosexuality be successfully articulated in society? According to some, homosexuals are doomed to be secluded and restricted to marginalized worlds. As filmmaker, Gaël Morel has often chosen to portray such worlds, enquiring deeply below the surface of what actually means to be an outcast.\n\nIn &quot;Le Clan&quot;, for example, Morel digs into the lives of outcast youngsters, which share an obvious resemblance to some of the protagonists of &quot;À toute vitesse&quot;. There is, however, a much subtler approach of such topics in this film, perhaps as part of André Téchiné&apos;s influence (who appears listed in the credits).\n\nSpivak&apos;s book &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot; explains that authority is built upon a specific loci of enunciation. In this film, traditional society has already attributed a certain loci or place to those who dare to defy the heterosexual normative.\n\nNonetheless, Morel goes much deeper than that. Handsome and talented Quentin is a young writer that has just won an award and is on his way to success. He does have quite an ambivalent position about marginalization. For example, he accuses the French bourgeois of misunderstanding his novel, as he has no intentions of depicting outcasts because for him they are normal people; he affirms that it is the bourgeois who constantly ostracize and discriminate others. Clearly, some of that is truth, as the mesocratic class tends to judge harshly those who do not fit into the symbolic order.\n\nAs the film goes on, Quentin starts spending time with Samir, an Algerian boy that is still grieving the loss of his boyfriend; Quentin&apos;s tantalizing physic presence serves as cannon fodder for Samir&apos;s masturbatory urges as can be explicitly seen in one scene. Will the two boys consummate their passion or is only one of them interested in such consummation? Quentin apparently defends the rights of the Algerians as he publicly accuses acts of racism and violence, but at the same time he despises Samir just as much as he spurns Julie, his girlfriend or Jimmy, his best friend (interpreted by Stéphane Rideau, an actor extremely familiarized with gay productions). Over and over again, Quentin is seen as someone who takes advantage of social unfairness in order to gain publicity for himself, and certainly once he starts making his way in the publishing world he decides to move to Paris, quickly discarding friends and love interests.\n\nJimmy is a jobless guy, with no real prospects of a &apos;decent&apos; future. And Samir is a boy who barely has enough money to pay the rent. Except for Julie, all other characters are on the edge of poverty or delinquency. They are, however, strong and coherent. Julie trusts in the possibility to have a good relationship whether with Quentin or someone else, Samir decides to defend himself against French fascists that brutally assault him while Jimmy bravely defends Samir even if that means risking his physical integrity. Quentin, on the contrary, is unable to find coherence, his loci of enunciation becomes so firmly inserted in the symbolic order that he loses all true authority. That&apos;s how we can understand the lack of commitment in his acts: he has a relationship with Julie but seems willing to let her go as he sees fit; he starts a sentimental relationship with Samir only until he completes enough research for his next book; he supports gays or Algerians only as a marketing strategy, but he is never there when his friends need him. Despise all that, Morel manages to create a fascinating, talented, smart young man that carries the traits of a hero although none of the true virtues."

      "reviewBody": "This film is very slow paced and dated. I got this as I am a huge fan of Brian De Palma and must, simply must see everything he does and did. This film however is not very good. I would like to pawn it off on the fact that De Palma did not direct the whole thing and was just one third of the team but that would be a lazy cop out. This movie is slow because he and the others are new and inexperienced at film making. This was one of his first movies if not the first and you can tell he is a virgin as far as film-making goes. This movie does a few high points. Their is the typical fast forward motion that most De Palma films have in this but I think it was more to save film in this than to be artistic, but it was out of this that the fast forward shots for Carrie, Hi, Mom, and Greetings were born. Their is also a highly funny portion in this movie with an Arab ex boyfriend of the bride who comes to visit. I love this part of the movie the groom is trying to pass the bride off to the Arab so he can free himself from the shackles that will be marriage, but the Arab does not bite and gets the heck out. This movie is also good because it has early performances by Robert De Niro and William Finnley. They are great as the grooms guest and I love that they are in this. Watch this movie for De Palma&apos;s growth as a filmmaker but stay away if you are just an average movie goer.",

This movie features the last days World War II as seen through the eyes of Pavel, a young resistance fighter. He and his band of partisans deal with informers, resentful villagers, hunger, exhaustion and a Nazi commander named Engelchen, who is very determined to wipe them out. On top of all this, Pavel has fallen in love with Marta, another resistance fighter, who is sleeping with Gestapo officers to glean information and who is very naturally worried what is going to happen to her after the war. This movie is a little different than many war movies in that it doesn&apos;t really strive for suspense or excitement, even though there are plenty of action scenes. Instead the focus is on the daily grind of such a life and its cost on the fighters and everyone else. The performances are all good and I particularly liked the minimalist soundtrack.",

      "reviewBody": "Phobos (Greek for fear) is the name of a club to be opened where the arrogant owner, a crooked contractor, an honest foreman, a druggie DJ, and a couple of girls meet. The club once was a WII bunker and below that there are is a mine. The clumsy DJ accidentally presses a red button setting in motion the bunker&apos;s security. Now all the kids are trapped and have to find a way out. In addition to secured doors, there are traps, mines and other dangers that imperil their lives. But there is more. One of the girls with an interest in the supernatural notices that being in this condition brings to surface all the fears of the kids: fire, contaminants, water, corpses. And that something or someone in the bunker feeds off those fears and creates conditions to scare them to death. All of them will have to face their fears, initially unknowingly and then on purpose in the hopes of calming the dark forces in the bunker. But not even that is enough. When it all seems hopeless the movie reaches its surprising resolution.\n\nThis is an excellent production, with good visuals and sound. The acting seems fine. The characters are all good, the DJ in particular is a funny guy. One oddity was that in the version that I saw, the subtitles included literally paragraphs of tiny text on the screen, instead of just sticking to 1-2 lines. The story is OK and for a while it&apos;s interesting because you want to find out what it&apos;s all about. It does get somewhat tedious because nothing serious happens. There is one death at the beginning and then at 1 hour and 6 minutes things get serious. Worst of all is the ending, a surprise but not the kind one wants- rather the one ending that will make any moviegoer be disappointed. The movie is enjoyable while it&apos;s going, it gets tiring eventually, and disappointing in the end.",

      "reviewBody": "Pixar were starting to experiment. After the success of their previous short &apos;Luxo Jr&apos;, Lasseter attempted to recreate the technicality and wonderment of the animation by introducing new techniques. Imitating geographically complex locations, such as the bike shop, showcased how advanced rendering has evolved throughout the 80s. Lasseter was able to detail several bicycles (include the spokes) and still maintain a consistent frame rate. Still, he managed to convey a story through visually striking methods, this time an unwanted unicycle nostalgically dreaming about its time at the circus. As minimal and weak as the story is, it melancholically portrays depression. A somewhat mature theme for the younger audience, but with enough buoyancy and creativity to keep them engaged. The anthropomorphic objects are consistently animated and uphold a sense of personality, however with the introduction of a human character, highlights areas of weakness in terms of animation. That clown is something else. Absolutely terrifying, and I&apos;m sure many kids bursted into tears. The rigid formation, stiff facial features and essence of inhumanity show that replicating human models was just not ready. Although, an admirable attempt nonetheless. Certain aesthetics have aged well, others have not. Red&apos;s Dream certainly is no nightmare, but not the idyllic fantasy Lasseter may have visualised. Certainly ambitious!",

Does changing the past create different, parallel universes?\n\nFor this TV movie, I took the view that most movies gave which is to assume time is a straight line.  Unfortuently it makes the movie a lot more confusing and hard to follow.\n\nThis TV movie is much like the &apos;The Butterfly Effect&apos;. Our hero wants to go back into time and stop the war in vietnam so that his brother can live.  To this end, he believes stopping the JFK assassination will stop the vietnam war ever being conducted (as well as concluding the cold war 30 years early!).\n\nBut as ever, if you change the past something will happen to make things worse for the future.  For some reason, Lyndon Johnson decides to nuke Vietnam as well as send in more troops.  Heck, why don&apos;t you just use the fabled &apos;neutron bomb&apos; whilst your at it.\n\nAnyhow, everything cocks up and the time-travellers are left wondering if they can ever change the past.  Our hero goes to a local hospital where he finds his younger brother and tells him to stay out of Vietnam.\n\nBut if he went in the past to prevent his brother going to vietnam, this means the hero would have no recollection of his brother ever going and dying in vietnam - thus he would have no reason to go back in time.\n\nThis is one of many time-paraodoxes that can hurt your head if you try to think about it.\n\nWhat happens at the end? Well, lets just say time, it appears, has a concious.\n\nOverall: 5/10."

      "reviewBody": "What often threatens to turn into a soppy and soft-headed drama about misunderstood middle-class youth ends up a surprisingly shaded and subdued movie by John Frankenheimer (his first, though he had started in television, directing among other things an earlier version of this script).\n\nWe are still in those semi-mythic 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees.  James MacArthur (adoptive son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and later to enter pop culture as Hawaii 5-0&apos;s Danno) gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater which escalates to his throwing a punch at the manager (Whit Bissell) and being booked down at the police station.  His dad (James Daly), a big-shot movie producer gets the call, doesn&apos;t listen to his son&apos;s version of the story, and pulls strings to get him off.\n\nBut MacArthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mom (Kim Hunter) can&apos;t knock off.  Things worsen in the Coldwater Canyon homestead until MacArthur, trying to vindicate himself, stages a reprise of the original incident....\n\nThe movie doesn&apos;t quite avoid the attitudes  and cliches  of its time, but presents them with considerable nuance: Every character gets an honorable hearing; every point of view has its merits (and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it).  There are flaws (the word `crummy,&apos; a standard rebellious euphemism of the era, is used about 30 times too often) but they&apos;re outweighed by strengths.  The movie benefits from a strong cast (most notable among them the excellent character actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a resolutely non-exploitative way of telling its story.  From a vantage point in the new millennium, the hot water MacArthur finds himself in may seem a little tepid, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honorable.",

All true Christians have vanished from the face of the earth leaving all those left behind wondering what has happened to them. To get answers two FBI agents named &quot;Adam Riley&quot; (David A. R. White) and &quot;Charles Baker&quot; (Kevin Downes) are assigned the case. At the same time a young Jewish rabbi by the name of &quot;Jacob Krause&quot; (Brad Heller) also seeks some answers and after researching the Bible becomes one of the 144,000 witnesses for Christ as foretold in the book of Revelation. Meanwhile, life begins to change for the worse for everybody. Now, rather than disclose the rest of the story and risk ruining the film for those who haven&apos;t seen it I will just say that this is one of the better Christian movies dealing with this particular subject. While I don&apos;t believe it fully portrayed how difficult and chaotic things would be it does detail some of the prophesied events in an adequate manner. For example, in this particular movie the &quot;mark of the Beast&quot; is depicted as a small computer chip which is called a &quot;B-chip&quot; and is inserted in the right wrist. Be that as it may, I liked this film and I recommend it to all of those who enjoy movies in this genre. Above average.",

      "name": "Nice and original Spaghetti/Chorizo Western co-produced between Spain and Italy  ,  being starred by  the best Sartana , Gianni Garco",
      "reviewBody": "SARTANA is a fundamental archetype in Spaghetti/Paella genre as well as James Bond in spy-genre , here Gianni Garco-Sartana stars an entertaining SW with lots of action , gun-play and fun . As always , the mythic personage appears elegant and dressed in black and with a killer look . Gianni Garco&apos;s Sartana is the standard by which every spaghetti antihero is measured along with Lee Van Cleef&apos;s Sabata and Franco Nero&apos;s Django . The film deals with a cache of gold and counterfeit money that has disappeared turning into several hands . The dark , elegant hero , a freelance gunman named Sartana (Gianni Garco or John Garco) appears to chase the nasty thief , discovers the robberies and settles disputes by shooting . Bemusing Spaghetti Western with Sartana as a tough and stranger protagonist , he&apos;s an efficient gunslinger acting as judge , jury , and executioner . At the beginning Sartana arrives in a small town named Sandy Creek where occurs a slaughter by two nasty deputies (Luis Induni and Dan Van Husen) who kill a judge (Francisco Sanz) and he then seeks vengeance . Sartana is taken prisoner and locked along with Grand Full (Piero Lulli) . It follows the seemingly endless adventures of Sartana in search of a cache of stolen gold . The confrontation will be inevitable among the town&apos;s ambitious sheriff (Massimo Serato) , an astute widow named Belle (Nieves Navarro) , a cruel murderous Mexican general named Monk (Jose Jaspe) and of course Sartana . At the end takes place a spectacular showdown in the streets of a town in which Sartana contends against all . \n\nThis co-production Italian/Spanish is an exciting Sartana movie starred by Gianni Garco , it is plenty of action , shootouts , double-crosses , twists and loads of violence and blood . Sartana himself is like a crossover between Clint Eastwood&apos;s The Man with no Name and ¨Django¨, a black-clad amoral anti-hero ; adding the special characteristics from James Bond , his quirky gadgets and elegance . Sartana character is in equal parts mysterious , cool and deadly ; he is not out there to chase the bandits like a simple bounty hunter , he is just out for money and blood . His quirky gadgets often bring to mind the other similar character , Sabata played by Lee Van Cleef and Yul Brynner . The first Sartana was ¨Gunfighters Die Harder&quot; or &quot;If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death&quot; a trend-setting film by Gianfranco Parolini with Gianni Garco , Klaus Kinski and Fernando Sancho . The best Sartana are directed by Giuliano Carmineo , alias Anthony Ascott, he realized various with George Hilton who replaces to Garco . Hilton played more natural and roguish than Garco who was cold and peculiar . The later &quot;Sartana&quot; movies directed by Anthony Ascott became increasingly cartoonish and humorous . It was followed by director Alfonso Balcazar with ¨Sartana non Perdona or Sonora¨ with George Martin , Jack Elam and Gilbert Roland . Miles Deem directed two Sartanas deemed lousy and cheesy . Furthermore , a string of sequels and rip-offs with other Z-series directors.\n\nThe movie gets the usual Western issues , such as greedy antiheroes, violent facing off , quick zooms , exaggerated baddies and musical score with Ennio Morricone influence , among them . There appears as secondaries the habitual at Italian Western and Peplum genre , a cast played by the customary plethora of Spanish actors : Jose Jaspe , Maria Vico , Francisco Sanz , Frank Braña , Fernando Bilbao , Luis Induni ; and Italian players : Piero Lulli , Bruno Corazzari , Sal Borghese , Renato Baldini . Furthermore , the Eurotrash goddess, the babe named Nieves Navarro or Susan Scott as a cunning and killer widow . Special mention to Franco Pesce, Spaghetti&apos;s customary, and occasional comic relief as an old inventor who provides strange gadgets to Sartana . Very good Spag musical score , it&apos;s composed and conducted by Bruno Nicolai, Morricone&apos;s usual collaborator . Appropriate cinematography by Julio Ortas , photographed on location in Hoyo de Manzanares, Madrid and Rome, Lazio . The film is well produced by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero with his company Copercines financed a lot of Westerns , he built a Western town in Hoyo De Manzanares (Madrid) , today disappeared , called ¨Golden City¨ where filmed several Chorizo Western and various ¨Zorro¨ films as well as Sartana movies . The picture is professionally directed by Anthony Scott or Giuliano Carmineo who made several Spaghetti as ¨The moment to kill¨, ¨Find a place to die¨ , ¨They call him Cemetery¨ , ¨They call me Hallaluya¨ , and the Sartana movies : &quot;Have a Good Funeral, My Friend, Sartana Will Pay&quot; , ¨Sartana the gravedigger&apos;(69) ,&quot;Sartana&apos;s Coming, Get Your Coffins Ready&quot; , ¨Light the fuse Sartana is coming¨(71) . Overall, this is a must see for SW aficionados . A cult Spaghetti , essential for the genre lovers.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I suppose a lot of people did not seem to like this movie. I did. It&apos;s one real flaw was obvious from the beginning, a preachy, environmental tone. Aside from that, it has a lot to recommend it. First, Sean Connery can scarcely do anything bad. He lifts a maybe ho-hum script into the sky. He is simply believable as his character at all times. Lorraine Bracco was pretty, and hit all of her part as well. Her nasal New York accent seems to have grated on some of the commentators, but I believe that it was the director&apos;s intent. The conflict may have been a bit formulaic, but you have to have SOMETHING to make a movie about. I&apos;d say check it out.",

Zero political consciousness.\n\n* Gig economy assassins. But even they live in squalor.\n\n* Cyberpunk + trash aesthetic. Iraq war aesthetic across the whole world.\n\n* Nothing works because why would you want it to, when you&apos;re stuck below? Meanwhile super advanced microchips.\n\n* The robots while they don&apos;t violate Asimov&apos;s principles, they&apos;re really passive-aggressive and catty.\n\n* The ghetto robot interface surgery. High tech microchip heists. Hacker culture is the one thing that did advance but they&apos;re limited by seemingly 1980s computers they have to scrap together.\n\n* The comedy of Matt Damon&apos;s leading man stoicism reacting to all of this zaniness, demoralization, and hopelessness.\n\n* (The big thing the film is missing a VR component to make life bearable below, giving some people the sedative illusion of a false Elysium. Like... WHAT IF you could wear a goggle over your eyes that shows the same busted up world except everything is green and beautiful, and everyone has deepfake smiles.)\n\n* Most interesting is the poor v rich spend all their time plotting and fending each other off. Consider the discomfort that both their views are each other.\n\n* Dysgenics on Elysium. Ie, it&apos;s not the geniuses who built Elysium but their grandkids who grew up there ruling it, making its destruction inevitable. &apos;Good times create weak men&apos; etc...\n\n* There is still spiritual consciousness but only below.\n\n* Above is no utopia. They are not particularly more educated or gifted, but susceptible to primitive coups, corruption, bureaucracy. You kind of feel bad for them as being born there is being trapped, they&apos;re unprepared for any sort of reality.\n\n* Opposite down below the most resilient survive and scrap by through friendship and brotherhood. Creates some kind of American revolution feeling.\n\nI feel that there should be a series with this universe that explores the down vs up, because they struck prophetic gold on the whole thing. Plus it is epic. The flaws that were glaring back in 2013 feel minor compared to how incredible the production and concept is."

It&apos;s simply a fun comedy and it dosen&apos;t need to, nor does it want to, be looked at beyond that, it&apos;s very funny and there are a ton of scenes where you can tell the cast was improvising and having fun together. It&apos;s definitely much longer than it needs to be, running for nearly two hours, I found that unnecessary and there were definitely several parts that could have been trimmed to be make this a more suitable ninety minutes, that&apos;s as long as I feel a movie like this should be. Bill Murray shines in the lead role, this is very early in his career but it is clearly evident that he already had the confidence and charisma to play the main character and was very capable of holding the whole movie. It&apos;s not a flawless film, but Stripes is very enjoyable to watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. \n\nA pair of slackers join the US Army with the hopes of getting their act together. \n\nBest Performance: Bill Murray",

      "reviewBody": "In 202 BC Publius Scipio inflicted a devastating defeat on Hannibal at Zama. This triumph has been used in this flagrantly propogandist film to justify Mussolini&apos;s invasion of Abyssinia. This expensively made &apos;epic&apos; was not a success and we can safely assume that its influence on the average Italian cinema-goer was minimal.\n\nDespite its jingoistic speeches and upraised Roman salutes this film, purely as a film, should not be entirely dismissed as there are some very effective scenes with marvellous images captured by cinematographers Ubaldo Urata and Anchise Brizzi. The score is by Ildebrando Pizzetti who contributed to the original score for Pastrone&apos;s &apos;Cabiria&apos; in 1914!\n\nDirector Carmine Gallone&apos;s film career stretched from 1913 to 1962 and he keeps the momentum going here with powerful crowd scenes and some intimate dialogues involving Hannibal, Velia and Sophonisba. In fact Gallone&apos;s best directed scenes feature the tantalising Francesca Braggiotti as Sophonisba. This actress did very few films and when her husband John Lodge did the acting profession a great service by going into politics she became the First Lady of Connecticut. Our loss. Velia as played by luscious Isa Miranda is nobility incarnate and defiantly declares to Hannibal: &apos;Romans fear only the Gods&apos;. If the character of Scipio is meant to mirror that of Il Duce it is very much an &apos;own goal&apos; as the actor Annibale Ninchi is totally devoid of charisma. Ironically it is the character of Hannibal as played by Camillo Pilotti who is by far the most interesting and sympathetic. This cannot have been intentional surely?!\n\nThe last fifteen minutes is devoted to the Battle of Zama which depicts the gruesome brutality of hand-to-hand combat. The battle opens with the charge of Hannibal&apos;s trumpeting elephants. Should any animal rights activists be watching I would strongly recommend they take an opportunity at this point to make a cup of tea. As one critic has cleverly observed: &apos;What Scipio did to the elephants, Mussolini was to do to Italy!",

This feels nothing like an &quot;Apes&quot; movie at all, and the continuity starts to get a little strange. Even ignoring the paradox of the time loop, there is no explanation of how the apes became able to speak and so forth. If Caesar had a mate and this was 500 years in the future it might make sense, but apes simply do not have the ability to speak!",

When I saw it, it was a supporting film for a Claude Lelouch film, and I was expecting nothing from it. I agree with the previous comment (Jefke Peeters) (which now no longer seems to be here). It was a surprise and a delight from start to finish: consistently inventive, funny and charming. Unfortunately it seems to be one of those films that made little impact when released and sank quickly without trace. It would be lovely for somebody to find it and bring it out for everyone to enjoy again. The Lelouch film was good, too, as it happens, but this is the one that I remember.",

      "reviewBody": "One of Sean Connery&apos;s personal favorites among his movies is The Hill. He had high hopes for its success and that it would break him out of the James Bond mold. Unfortunately the movie going public wanted more James Bond and less Sean Connery at this point.\n\nThe Hill is close to a perfect masterpiece of characterization and cinematography. Director Sidney Lumet opted for black and white in making The Hill and I think it enhances the stark surroundings of the British military stockade in North Africa. These are really the forgotten people of World War II.\n\nIf Sean Connery could have gotten a chance for a Dirty Dozen type mission from the British army he would have taken it. His character is very similar to Charles Bronson&apos;s from that film. Bronson was an officer, Connery a sergeant major, Bronson shot, Connery struck a superior with extremely good cause, but their respective armies didn&apos;t see it that way.\n\nSo now Sean is in a cell with four other prisoners all of varying character, Roy Kinnear, Ossie Davis, Jack Watson, and Alfred Lynch. Norman Bird is the commandant, but the camp is really run as in all armies by the Sergeant-Major Harry Andrews. Andrews has a special punishment for the prisoners, called The Hill; a specially constructed mound of sand about 200 feet high where they have to run up and down it with field pack in the desert heat.\n\nAndrews has the assistance of Staff Sergeant Ian Hendry who has his own sadistic bent quite apart from military punishment. When one of Connery&apos;s cell-mates dies from punishment, all hell threatens to break loose. \n\nOne of the things that attracted Sean Connery to this film according to the Citadel Film series book on his work was the fact that it was unlike James Bond, no glamorous locations, no fancy wardrobe and absolutely no romance. This would give him the chance to show he could be something other than James Bond.\n\nConnery got rave reviews for playing former Sergeant Major Joe Roberts in The Hill and the rest of the cast Sidney Lumet assembled did likewise. Unfortunately the film failed at the box office. Connery remarked that without his name on it, this would have been an art house special limited release type of work. But the public only wanted to see James Bond and it wasn&apos;t until The Anderson Tapes that Sean Connery finally got great reviews in a film that did well at the box office as well as the critics.\n\nOver 40 years after it was released The Hill now is considered a cinema masterpiece. Besides Connery my favorite performances are from Michael Redgrave as the medical officer who&apos;s not a strong man, but steps to the plate when his duty is clear and from Ossie Davis as a cynical black soldier who finally grows tired of the institutional racism he finds and &apos;leaves&apos; the army. You won&apos;t forget them, Connery or The Hill once you see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Released two months before &apos;2001: A Space Odyssey&apos;, and on a soap opera scale compared to that, &apos;Countdown&apos; comes from a time when movies didn&apos;t have to have huge budgets, big stars or auteur directors to get national distribution: I saw it as a second feature (remember them? - to &apos;Ice Station Zebra&apos;, I think, a far worse movie) in one of the now defunct three small cinemas in my home town. It&apos;s pretty formulaic, with a &apos;time clock&apos; plot, a little bit of character play, a fair bit of topicality, and for its time and budget, a reasonable stab at gritty space realism, compared to the stagey, squeaky &apos;Star Trek&apos; universe that had boldly gone on TV only two years before, and Kubrick&apos;s tour de force that was to follow shortly. Interesting as a snapshot of cinema history, with a director and lead actor (and Robert Duvall) who went on to join the A-list, which nobody knew about then. They don&apos;t make &apos;em like this any more; or if they do, they go straight to DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "Thank you Cinemax for dusting off this rare gem. You don&apos;t get too many chances to see this on the tube. The idea of Jerry Lewis popping in from 8 million light years away in his saucer to help Gen. Lee&apos;s troops fight the &quot;damn yankees&quot; should be enough incentive for anyone to make time for this and it doesnt disappoint. Unfortunately Jerry miscalculated and landed on Earth 100 years later-he&apos;s a student, not a very smart one but he is majoring in the &quot;Earth&quot; so his natural curiosity brought him down for a short stay, much to the frustration and eventual amusement of his mentor Mr. Delton on his home planet where his every move is monitored on the first 60&quot; wide screen I can remember seeing. The movie is just hilarious with sight gags galore. I thought I was going to fall out of my chair watching Jerry take his first glass of whiskey and then walk up the wall and stand on the ceiling to have a conversation with his host. And the Beatnik scene at the &quot;Hungry Brain&quot; is a real keeper although many probably wont get it-beatniks were the &apos;way cool&apos; hipsters that preceded the flower child movement of the 60&apos;s. Koo koo baby! Earl Holliman is very funny in an early role and Joan Blackman is scrumptious as Holliman&apos;s love interest that he can never seem to keep his hands off of. She later appeared in two Elvis flicks so you know she&apos;s got to be pretty hot. Just a great movie and I think ranks in Lewis&apos; top three with The Bellboy and The Errand Boy. Don&apos;t miss it. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Baker Street purists won&apos;t have too much to quarrel about with this adaption of Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s The Six Napoleons. Because of a master criminal&apos;s haste to get away, six people who bought busts of Napoleon Bonaparte are marked for death unless The Pearl Of Death is found.\n\nBasil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are on the trail of another master criminal, in the Sherlock Holmes stories, Professor Moriarty&apos;s second in command Giles Conover. Conover is played with a quiet menace by British colony regular Miles Mander.\n\nWhat Mander is after is the Borgia Pearl which with its connection to the Borgias has as bloody a history as the fabled Star Of India. Rathbone already pulls a double switch on Mander and his lovely accomplice Evelyn Ankers. But later through a bit of Holmes own hubris Mander steals the Borgia Pearl from the British Museum. \n\nBut he doesn&apos;t have it long. Pursued by the police fresh from the theft Mander ducks into a pottery shop and hides the pearl in some fresh plaster busts of Napoleon, in one of six of them which are later sold.\n\nNow he&apos;s on a mission to recover his loot and it&apos;s a bloody mission because Mander brings along in tow the Hoxton Creeper, a giant of a man who can and does snap people&apos;s backs to kill them. The creeper is played by Rondo Hatton and he brings this Holmes feature into the realm of Gothic horror. In fact Dr. Watson&apos;s knowledge of forensic medicine is called into play here when he correctly identifies Hatton&apos;s known method of homicide.\n\nOne of the better Basil Rathbone films from the Sherlock Holmes series.",

She -once more- proved that she really is the Queen of Pop, a tremendous trend-setter as far as fashion, politics and religion are concern. Her show was clearly provocative but was extremely inspired and glamorous. Madonna stands alone between two worlds... The stage and her family. There are numerous juxtapositions inside the film...Madonna is spectacular on the stage, but she is also a woman with political and ethical values. I have to admit that perhaps she gave too much emphasis to her being a follower of Caballah, but on the hole the film is great...A must for all Madonna fans and for people who love show business. A graphic and artistic triumph by any means. Generally speaking, I saw a Madonna much more wise, raw,authentic and determined. She has a belief and she stands for it.\n\nOh, and if you need some extra pop-star glam quality seek for the name Anna Vissi. She is huge...",

I found it charming and suitably acted.\n\nI assume the major dislike of this film is the secondary plot featuring Joey (Richard Portnow) &amp; Co., which I would agree is unimaginative and ill-fitting. However, that doesn&apos;t affect my overall feelings. Potentially - if anything, it mentions a few times the negative depictions; somewhat surprisingly, for a 1995 release anyway.\n\nThe story between Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), Jack (Chevy Chase) and Sandy (Farrah Fawcett) is nice. It&apos;s simple, but it&apos;s one that works extremely well - I felt attached to them, they have good chemistry with each other.\n\nThere&apos;s not much more to be said. I truly did enjoy &apos;Man of the House&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "In need of some Christmas spirit, I decided to watch &quot;Noel&quot; from 2004. All I saw was the name Susan Sarandon, so I didn&apos;t realize that the late Paul Walker and the late Robin Williams, who died within nine months of each other, were also in this film. Reason enough to cry right there.\n\nNoel is the story of several people on Christmas Eve and Christmas. Walker is Mike, a police officer, engaged to Nina (Penelope Cruz). His jealousy is tearing apart their relationship. He has another problem. Artie (Alan Arkin) who runs a coffee shop is extra-attentive and shows up at Mike&apos;s house with a wild story.\n\nSarandon&apos;s character, Rose, is a successful book editor who is divorced. She is caring for her mother, who has Alzheimer&apos;s and doesn&apos;t talk. In the next room there is a man who seems to be in a coma. He&apos;s always alone, so Rose, as she&apos;s decorating her mother&apos;s room, goes into his room and puts an angel on his window. In the corner of the room, behind the door, sits Charlie (Robin Williams), who startles her.\n\nRose meets Nina after she leaves Mike and goes to her family&apos;s Christmas Eve dinner. And she runs into Williams again; he has a bizarre story as well.\n\nThen there&apos;s Marcus who has someone to break his hand so he can be in the hospital on Christmas. As a child, it was his best Christmas ever. We can assume from that he didn&apos;t have a very happy upbringing. Mike, Dennis, and Artie all end up at the hospital at the same time.\n\nThis is a really lovely film about miracles and angels who walk the earth whom we don&apos;t recognize as such, and how we can touch each other&apos;s lives without knowing it. It was very sweet and uplifting and, as I said, a massive tearjerker given the presence of the two late stars. One chose death; one had death thrust upon him. Either way, it&apos;s tragic.",

      "reviewBody": "(Version reviewed is the 95-minute showing on ARD on July 24, 2001. There seems to be a scene excluded with Hildegard and Cpt. Lindner telling the story as a flashback. Film has no credits at all.)\n\nDr. Harnack, once a resistance member himself, shot a fabulous, never boring picture, eleven years after the attempted assassination of German &quot;Führer&quot; Adolf Hitler. Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg (Wolfgang Preiss in an appropriate rôle), a leading member of the secret regime resistance group around Goerdeler and Beck (played by veteran actors Paul Bildt and Werner Hinz), decides to kill Hitler soon after his installment as chief of staff of Eastern replacement troops. After a first try has failed - General von Tresckow says: &quot;That guy (Hitler) has even chance on his side&quot; - , Stauffenberg himself places a time bomb in Hitler&apos;s headquarters in Eastern Prussia. Then follows a minute description of the main events of the rest of the day, July 20, 1944.\n\nAuthors Weisenborn, Lüddecke and Harnack extended the depiction of events to a preacher and a civilian resistance group in Berlin. The frequent change of perspectives, though, was an unfortunate choice.\n\nAnother plot is about two fictitious characters, Hildegard Klee (Annemarie Düringer) and Captain Lindner (Robert Freytag), who is a dedicated Nazi officer. When both watch how an innocent Jewish doctor is brutally arrested, the officer states: &quot;These are excesses only. But the front isn&apos;t part of it. The front is clean!&quot; - &quot;But you&apos;re fighting for it!&quot; Hildegard answers. - It&apos;s supposed to make clear why German resistance consisted of (aristocratic) officers to a large extent. - Lindner is finally convinced when he reports about witnessing the killing of women and children when he is back at war again.\n\nAlthough there have been controversies among historians about the (would-be) assassins&apos; motives, and research has been done for over forty years since, the film is still a fine history lesson. There is an indication of the different aims in one scene when socialists and monarchists quarrel at a secret meeting until a philosophical Maximilian Schell settles the conflict. The narrator later declares that the July 20 action was &quot;about the destruction of illegitimate tyranny and about the honor of the German name.&quot;\n\nIn consequence, when Stauffenberg ponders over what he is resolved to do, Harnack lets him view scenes of bomb attacks, tanks approaching and soldiers wounded before his mind&apos;s eye (all archive material), but there is only a very short take of what might be a KZ barbed wire fence: the fate of millions of Jews appears not to have been a motive.\n\nAlthough very well done, &quot;Der 20. Juli&quot; is not a stand-out cinematographically. It was produced in competition with G. W. Pabst&apos;s &quot;Es geschah am 20. Juli&quot;, which premiered a trifle earlier. Of the actors, Ernst Schröder is very efficient as the relentless hunter of resistant fighters, credible and far away from the caricatures in some American and British war movies. Likewise, Düringer, Freytag and Preiss do fine jobs."

Some men don&apos;t want to play grandfathers; others embrace the next phase of their careers. For Anthony Quinn, he continued to play the overbearing patriarch in 1978 just as he did in 1958. The only difference was that in the late seventies, he was in low-budget Mexican dramas instead of A-tier Hollywood flicks.\n\nIn The Children of Sanchez, he&apos;s a tyrant at home with everyone from his daughter to his mother-in-law. He wants to be the provider and the head of the house, but he has to face old age, poverty, and a changing social culture. His daughter is headstrong and wants freedom; he believes her duty is to support him and then support her husband. Although I love Anthony Quinn and watched the entire movie to support him, I don&apos;t really recommend it for his fans. In one scene, Tony is in bed with his girlfriend. She lets out a frustrated sigh and asks, &quot;Are you done already?&quot; I felt so sorry for him! It&apos;s virile, sexy Anthony Quinn, and his bedroom skills are getting insulted? This isn&apos;t the sort of scene the ladies who loved him in the 1950s want to see him in. But yes, everyone gets old, and we can hope that he was glad to still headline his movies.",

      "reviewBody": "From the Sky Down (2011) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nI&apos;ll start off right here stating that I really haven&apos;t followed U2 and that I know very little about their music outside the &quot;greatest hits&quot; that are constantly on the radio. I always wanted to dig a little deeper into their music and after seeing this documentary it made me want to do so more than ever. The film&apos;s main focus is on the making of the band&apos;s 1991 album Acthung Baby, which was a big breaking point for the group. The documentary covers their early career and everything leading up to this album including the various highs. However, as the band states, they put all their money into U2: RATTLE AND HUM, which turned out to be a disaster and the band discusses how this album was really going to either make them or break them. If you&apos;re a fan of the band then there&apos;s no question that you&apos;re going to want to watch this simply due to all the archival information including stock footage of concerts, interviews and of course some behind the scenes stuff. Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. are all interviewed about their work on the album, the various troubles the bank faced and of course the end result. There are several memorable moments here but one of the highlights is when we get to hear an early version of a certain song, a reworked version and over a period of time we come to see how it finally got to its finished stages. The band commenting the entire time talking about what it took to get to that point and the various changes along the way. Another strong point is a sequence where the band was on shaky ground and director Dennis Guggenheim has a funny bit where we see other bands who ended up breaking up over much smaller things. The documentary really does do a good job at making the viewer a fly on the wall in terms of everything that went on with the production of the album. There&apos;s some excellent moments scattered throughout and only a few moments of blandness."

      "reviewBody": "I watched this movie for two reasons, first, I like the TV Series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and second, I enjoy watching most Antonio Banderas movies. Aside from this I had no clue what to expect.\n\nThe movie starts out well enough and for about the first 40 minutes or so weaves a mildly interesting plot. After a certain point the movie takes a few confusing turns where the viewer is wondering how the new direction is going to align with the plot that was woven earlier. The climax, where the plot is revealed, is surprisingly good. Though, the ending, where the two separate paths the movie had taken are brought together is, in my opinion, quite lame.\n\nThe acting is good enough. Antonio Banderas and William Fichtner are good actors and they do a decent job. The rest of the cast doesn&apos;t fail either. In the end, it is the script which is a let down. Maybe it seemed great on paper and lost its charm when brought alive on the screen.\n\nOne more thing. The script somehow brings nuclear physics into play. Why or to what end is the question the viewer is likely to ask after the movie ends. When an element as strong as science, mathematics or religion has to be brought in, I believe, making it central to the plot would pay off better dividends. For example, &quot;Pi&quot; by Darren Aronofsky or &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies.\n\nOverall, it is an average thriller with bits of science thrown in. It is not exactly a waste of time, if you happen to catch it on TV. Otherwise, I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to buy or rent a DVD. You aren&apos;t missing anything.",

      "name": "Dracula (1931) - US Version ***1/2; Spanish Version ***",
      "reviewBody": "The Browning/Lugosi &apos;classic&apos; has always been one of my favorite Universal horror films but, ever since the simultaneously-produced &apos;rival&apos; Spanish version resurfaced, the &apos;original&apos; has taken a beating by fans and historians alike - mainly because the latter features superior camera-work! This, however, is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version (the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn&apos;t even be considered, I guess). Still, the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn&apos;t done it any favors! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001, singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and, of course, George Robinson&apos;s cinematography. However, coming back to it now, I felt that Rubio&apos;s hysterical rendering of the character (which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN [1974] of all people!) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye&apos;s unforgettable characterization in the US version. Regarding the &quot;superior camera-work&quot;, I guess this is true for individual sequences (Dracula&apos;s introduction, for instance) but, frankly, I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning, who admittedly wasn&apos;t very fond of this technique. Given that of late we&apos;ve also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn&apos;t actually direct the film, he couldn&apos;t have - since he wasn&apos;t even there!! It may be however, that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney (who had been slated for the title role) died before shooting began, the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky, another element with which Browning felt uneasy! Well, whatever went on behind the scenes, for me what&apos;s in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue (especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi, Frye and Edward Van Sloan), irreproachable performances (Frye and Van Sloan were at their best, while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT [1934] and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN [1939]) and memorable individual scenes (the entire first act set in Transylvania, the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing, Renfield&apos;s various ravings). The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it! If anything, this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings...\n\nWhich brings us back to the Spanish Dracula: like I said, the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing &apos;alternate&apos; to the Lugosi version...but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias, whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can&apos;t hold a candle to Lugosi&apos;s definitive screen vampire! This version does go to places where the American doesn&apos;t (Browning shies away from the vampire attacks, for instance) and even features &apos;new&apos; scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy&apos;s demise - but, at 104 minutes (a full half-hour longer than the US version, when considering that they were following the same script!) it&apos;s way overlong for its own good. The Browning/Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail&apos;s pace: take, for instance, the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately, while Villarias takes forever to do so (even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless).\n\nA word about the DVD quality: disappointingly, the Spanish version features closed-captions (for the hearing-impaired) rather than proper subtitles. As for the US version, the print utilized for this particular transfer (which differs from that of the original, and more satisfactory, 1999 release) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack! It also reverts to the &apos;original&apos; single groan during Dracula&apos;s staking (instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc)...but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence, which had been missing from the previous edition!! Well, this only means that it&apos;s worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive...",

Finally this film was given a decent release and they used the Cryptkeeper to try and sell it. Sadly, this will be the only thing under the Tales From the Crypt banner that I will never own. Ritual just wasn&apos;t up to Crypt standards. Demon Knight was one of the best horror films on the 90&apos;s and Bordello of Blood was a laugh riot. Ritual is neither of these things. It&apos;s basically a retelling of I Walked With a Zombie. It has no surprises and it&apos;s rather straight-forward in it&apos;s direction. I&apos;m also not big on voodoo movies. There&apos;s just something about them, and they all tell pretty much the same story. So not much stands out and the film is a bit boring. The pace could have been tightened up a bit. It&apos;s a shame too because the acting is quite good. Jennifer Gray leads the cast and is up to the task. The new nose must be working out for her because she looks to be in the best shape of her life. Daniel Lapaine and Kristen Wilson, both of whom I&apos;m not familiar with, also are admirable. And Tim Curry and Craig &quot;I need to fire my agent&quot; Sheffer show up to lend their credentials. Seriously, Sheffer is a way better actor than his filmography would have you believe. Another plus is the effects. What little gore there is is done expertly. Gotta love the doctor getting microwaved."

This movie is not terrible, but very cheesy and extremely predictable. Much like the recent faith-based movies all the problems in this movie seemed to be solved way to easy. To me a movie without a real push back against the lead actor seems boring and too cookie cutter like. While I can&apos;t really say anything bad about this movie because I did like it, I can&apos;t really say anything really good about it either because ten minutes in I could tell how it would end.

Set in around 1900, we see a royal namby-pamby make a fool of himself in army training camp. Very moderate historic interest, and some pretty ladies wearing incredibly tight corsets, but otherwise a totally pointless flick with no redeeming factors whatsoever. Music composed by Peter Igelhoff, a very talented composer, but there are no songs or musical numbers. Perhaps this kind of entertainment was OK back in the fifties, but I can hardly believe that people queued to see it. The colours on my copy are good and sound quality is better than average.",

Locals and cops find corpses of the adults and journalists try to dig in more information but once again the children forms a cult group where one of the cult member is possessed by a demonic entity. This one lacks the atmosphere n surrealism of the first part but makes up for it by adding more body count but in a hilarious way.

Marlon Brando stars and directs this fine drama as the flawed Rio searches for his erstwhile pal who sold him out to a posse several years earlier. Most of the film&apos;s characters are unsavory types and the peace officers aren&apos;t much better. This picture has the great natural beauty of the Monterrey peninsula and Death Valley, and Karl Malden and Ben Johnson, among others, do superb work. Brando looks a tad overweight in his tight-fitting Mexican cowboy outfits. The film has plenty of drama and excitement and is accompanied by a wonderful music score by Hugo Friedhofer. Although some critics panned this film, it has legions of devotees.",

The thing must only have like one moving part. Three, the dialog is hilarious and the acting is horrendous. As a so bad its funny film, its definitely worth wasting an hour and a half on. But beyond that, this is really crappy. Even as a so bad its funny schlockfest, it could have been much better. It gets bogged down in an absurd conspiracy story about Nazis and the fourth Reich, so on. Although this retarded back story results in a great scene where a professor explains to Marlboro Man Haggerty ( actually they were Camels) the history of Nazis and elves at his Christmas dinner table. The name is false, as well, as there is only one elf.",

This one has colored geometric shapes. Far out. There is this silly subplot with this guy hooking up with one of his own kind and morphing into another dimension. It actually sounds intelligent until you see it. It is dull, dull, dull. It is thoughtless, thoughtless, thoughtless. As this young man searches for his own meaning, others move around him, confused. Just like the audience. There are long, pontificating speeches. &quot;I&apos;ll know it when I see it.&quot; &quot;I know I&apos;m destined for it.&quot; Gee, I wonder what it is. I&apos;m sure that the makers of this really saw it as an artistic endeavor. However, Stanley Kubrick, they ain&apos;t.",

It hardly ranks among the director&apos;s best efforts, but a pair of talented co-stars and the typically French pre-occupation with l&apos;amour fou help maintain interest all the way to the startling conclusion.",

It is a fine tribute to Catherine Deneuve, stop. Well, maybe also a pleasant appearance and tribute to that vastly overweight, but also vastly likable and talented Depardieu. The acting otherwise was atrocious, the characters caricatures. The plot in itself was credible enough and could have been followed quite successfully to some conclusion, but then takes some uncalled for and inexplicable turns which don&apos;t do anything to resuscitate a hammy production. Avoid it unless your only other option is a colonscopy."

      "reviewBody": "Anna Christie (1931)\n\nOn its own terms, this version of Garbo&apos;s Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is if anything more commanding (or more beautiful as a screen presence) and her acting is more restrained. And she seems frankly more at ease, probably for a lot of reasons, but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture, so had adjusted quickly.\n\nWithout comparing always one film to the other, this Anna Christie is still the same O&apos;Neill play with too many words. His themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here, but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway. There are some scenes missing--the Coney Island section is shortened and isn&apos;t as good--but overall it&apos;s a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply redoing what was done already, which I assume must be a frustrating experience.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way (not only the sets, but the shots, are all the same). There is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film--some of the storm, understandably, but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler (from the English language version) is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal, drunk as can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no replacing Dressler, for sure, but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance.\n\nClearly the themes--immigration, wayward fathers, daughters turning to prostitution, and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then, especially with European threads. Garbo, appropriately, plays a Swedish young woman. A pleasure.",

      "reviewBody": "There are far too few documentaries on general release so it&apos;s a rare  pleasure to sit in a dark screening room with six other people to watch  another example of bizarre real life unfold across the screen. The  Imposter is one of those documentaries where you sit there with the  sense of incredulity growing as every twist in the plot reveals itself.  It&apos;s not as jaw-droppingly absurd as the excellent Tabloid and it isn&apos;t  remotely funny, but it is a fascinating and compelling experience.  I&apos;ll qualify that; the story of The Imposter is fascinating while the  manner in which it is presented to us upon the screen is absolutely  compelling and worthy of the plaudits it has so far received, including  a nomination for the Grand Jury Prize at this year&apos;s Sundance Film  Festival and a gong in the same category at the Miami Film Festival.  In San Antonio, Texas on 13 June 1994, thirteen-year-old Nicholas  Barclay disappeared. Three and a half years later, when his family&apos;s  only hope was to find his remains and gain closure, they received word  that Nicholas was alive and had been found in Spain. His elder sister,  Carey, flew out to Spain to bring Nicholas home whereupon he unfolded a  tale of kidnapping and abuse. However, blonde, blue-eyed American  Nicolas had somehow become darker skinned, dark haired and French and  now looked out onto the world through brown eyes. Yet the family still  accepted him as their own! Told partly through interviews with the  players including, incredibly, the imposter himself and dramatized  interpretations of events, The Imposter gently reveals the events as  private investigator Charlie Parker suspects Frédérick Bourdin&apos;s true  identity and uncovers his history. It bears some resemblance to Le  Retour de Martin Guerre (or Sommersby if you preferred the American  adaptation) but there is no sign of altruism or a purity of intent from  Bourdin. Just as you think you&apos;ve understood the situation, another  nugget of information widens the eyes even further until &apos;How could the  family not know?&apos; turns to &apos;Why did they decide not to know?&apos; And still  more questions arrive.  It&apos;s an incredible story where doubt is cast over the sanity and  honesty of those at the heart of it. At one point, Nicholas&apos; sister  (the real one, not the version played by an actress) says with all  sincerity, &quot;Spain? That&apos;s, like, across the country!&quot; It is plainly  obvious we&apos;re not dealing with the brightest sparks. But being  educationally challenged does not mean dishonesty is not a factor.  Director Bart Layton weaves the tale beautifully, never giving away too  much in one go and his use of reconstruction blends perfectly with the  genuine interviews. The use of real person and actor for each  &apos;character&apos; so often jars in TV documentaries leaving the viewer  confused as to who s/he is watching on the screen. Here, Layton has  cast perfectly and the dual appearances compliment each other, blending  so it is neither noticeable nor important which version we are  watching.  Star status is usually reserved for performers in feature films, not  factual documentaries, but Bourdin is so relaxed, so matter of fact in  the telling of his own version of events that he draws the viewer in  and leaves us wanting to climb inside his head an know how his brain  turns and how many teeth are missing from each cog.  The Imposter, though unlikely to enthuse as wide an audience as last  year&apos;s Project Nim or Senna, is a bizarre, chilling, surprising and  thoroughly enthralling 99-minute eye-opening experience.",

The second part of the film is pretty much a promo for MGM as we get to see some footage from upcoming movies as well as some behind the scenes stuff from Marie Antoinette. Film buffs will also get a kick out of the 1937 Oscar ceremony where Frank Capra announces Spencer Tracy is too ill to be there to get his award so it&apos;s handed to Louie B. Mayer who then gives it to Tracy&apos;s wife. It&apos;s worth noting that a few of the films mentioned as &quot;coming soon&quot; ended up not being released for over a decade and a few of the films are announced with certain cast members but the final movies feature someone else."

The flashback of the shooter and spotter were interesting, one of the two security guards is one messed-up-in-the-brain, coke-sniffer, the other was a very annoying by-the-book rookie, the shooter was a &quot;paranoid&quot; man, and the spotter was a beautiful woman that &quot;got along with everybody&quot;, or so she thought, I would dare say Russel Mulcahy did an excellent job at directing and recommend it."

It goes like this...\n\nThree guys and a girl are out stealing banks using extreme sports talents. Action is okay, but after seeing movies like XXX, too much action has become somewhat boring. (A case of &quot;If I see another idiot jumping over a two deck bus...&quot;). Somehow they get into trouble with the police (gee, how is that possible?), a guy who stands in shadows and tortures them by keeping them in a really cold room, another guy who seems to be a cross between Elvis and a preacher (Horrors!).\n\nI seriously don&apos;t know what Natasha Henstridge is for, oh wait.. I do. Those semi nude scenes. Even the love scenes suck cuz there is absolutely no chemistry.\n\nThe dialogues are cliched, the plot is cliched, the characters are cliched and the ending is cliched.\n\nI loved Ocean&apos;s Eleven, but a hazard of its success seems to be the proliferation of crappy heist flicks that suck big time.\n\nI used to really like Stephen Dorf, and thought he was doing weird but interesting movies. Then he did this one, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever be able to see that Aerosmith video again without grimacing.\n\nStay away from this one if you can&apos;t take boredom very well.\n\nOverall rating 1/2"

      "reviewBody": "It is London in 1910 and protagonist Kate Croy, a beautiful young woman, is living with her wealthy but controlling aunt. Kate has fallen in love with Merton Densher, a journalist of whom her aunt disapproves and forbids her to see. Her aunt is pushing her in the direction of the &apos;more suitable&apos; Lord Mark. When wealthy young American heiress Milly Theale arrives on the scene Lord Mark informs Kate that Milly is dying and he intends to marry her for her money, to save his estates, before returning to Kate... Kate decides Merton should be the one getting close to Milly so, during an extended holiday in Venice guides them together... there is a risk though; what if he falls in love with her?\n\nI&apos;ve not read the book on which this film is based so can&apos;t say how they compare; but as a work in its own right I really enjoyed it. The romance feels real, with Kate clearly knowing she is taking a risk... both that her aunt will disinherit her for seeing Merton and that he might genuinely fall for Milly. The setting is beautifully realised but never feels dated... which it shouldn&apos;t as whatever present one is in feels modern for those people in it. Helena Bonham Carter does a brilliant job in the role of Kate; she shows what Kate is feeling with the subtlest of expressions; she also makes it easy to sympathise with Kate even while she is being morally ambiguous. Linus Roache and Alison Elliott impress as Merton and Milly respectively and the rest of the cast is solid. The film looks great from start to finish as it moves from London to Venice. Overall I&apos;d definitely recommend this to fans of period dramas.",

      "reviewBody": "I actually had the pleasure to see this film in the theater on opening night. Granted I was only 6 years old at the time, but it&apos;s an experience I&apos;ll never forget.\n\nSomething happened. It might have been the thunderous roar that came over the audience after the opening sequence. Maybe it was the cheering, the yelling, people going insane. Shook the whole damn place. Now I can&apos;t explain to you what actually happened, I wasn&apos;t born a poet, but it was just incredible. Something that I have yet to see happen again with any other movie. Something only a Rocky or Rambo picture could ever do. It made me a believer.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes is when Stallone is slapped by one of the Vietnamese pirate&apos;s. &quot;He sold us outThe bastard.&quot; Slap No reaction, just a look that could cut through steel. And that&apos;s what Rambo is all about. He is every man. Or what every man wants to be. Not simply a hero, but a winner.\n\n&quot;Like you said Colonel, he went home.&quot; This picture basically invented the action hero. Why do you think the 80&apos;s were filled with the blood and guts routine. Countless spin offs would try to recapture the glory. All but a few would fail. I&apos;ve even seen movies with direct quote rip-offs that actually steal several direct lines from this movie.\n\nIs it Casablanca? No. Is it Apocalypse Now? No. Is it supposed to be? No. Stallone already made his miracle picture in 1976. It&apos;s called Rocky and it&apos;s one for the ages. Rambo: Does only one thing. Simply put, kick ass.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Anonymously Yours&apos; is so powerful in it&apos;s sheer, untampered honesty. Candid, unpolished, covertly shot footage corroborates the girls spoken accounts in a very effective parallel manner.\n\nYou can see the girl&apos;s personal experience come through in their display of emotion, as scenes on location open a world that is truly foreign to western sensibilities.\n\nVery disturbing at times.  Very disturbing... though not inappropriate for the viewing audience.  The story and scenes from China....!  Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.  This story needs to be told far and wide.  I won&apos;t EVER forget this account.  What is happening to these girls is a crime of monstrous proportion.\n\nOver the years I&apos;ve heard men, brave coworkers, boast about their adventurous exploits with the girls in Thailand.  What brave men.  And where are the girls now these brave men conquered and pawed so courageously? Buried close by some commercial(!) leech pond along the China-Myanmar border?  Terrible. Unspeakable. Just terrible."

      "reviewBody": "Two brothers, David &amp; Peter, kidnap Tracey, the daughter of local tough guy gangster Arnie, they hold her to ransom for the sum of £100,000. What they hadn&apos;t bargained into the equation is that Tracey is one tough feisty lady, and that a turn of events will lead them to something far more scary than big bad gangster Arnie.\n\nThis is the second feature from director Paul Andrew Williams, and bearing in mind that his debut effort was the highly lauded gritty drama London To Brighton, it&apos;s no surprise to find that some folk are a little bemused as to the genre splicing nature of The Cottage. The Cottage is far more in keeping with Christopher Smith&apos;s 2006 horror comedy, Severance, and certainly it wouldn&apos;t be out of place as a double bill with that criminally undervalued picture.\n\nVery much a film of two halves, this picture is likely to prove a very divisive piece, and it will (has) only find an audience based on word of mouth alone. You will be hard pressed to find any sort of press marketing that will prepare you for the type of genre fusion film you are getting. Already, based on the comments written on this site thus far, you can see that some people were confused (or annoyed) by the tonal shift for the second half of the film. The first half sees poles apart brothers, David &amp; Peter, swapping comedy dialogue as they whisk through a number of exchanges and circumstances with the marvellously volatile Tracey. While the second part of the picture hits you over the head with a quick switch to horror formula that has catering fulfilment for the gore junkies amongst us.\n\nAnd this is where the problem lies with many, why didn&apos;t the film stay as a kidnap farce? Why didn&apos;t it set its stall out to be a horror film from the off? There is no denying that the films&apos; high points come with the horror moments, but the film is first and foremost a comedy, from the first reel to the cheeky end of credits sequence it is what it is. As deliciously sick as the gore shift is, The Cottage never once takes its tongue out of its bloody cheek. It&apos;s obvious that Paul Andrew Williams is having fun here, and he is clearly hoping his audience will as well. View it as an all encompassing comedy/horror/thriller in that order and you wont go far wrong.\n\nAndy Serkis plays David, the tough brother of the two, with Serkis doing a wonderful line in both visual and vocal comedy. This benefits Reece Shearsmith as Peter, a character so far under the thumb he can barely be seen. Shearsmith feeds off of Serkis to seal the comedy deal for this odd brotherly couple. British tabloid fave Jennifer Ellison plays Tracey, literally swearing for England to have the audience divided as to if they want her to survive or not! But it&apos;s a gutsy show from her and one hopes she ventures into this territory a bit more often. There is nothing new or fresh here, and this wont win any awards; even in its homeland of England, but it is FUN and it shows a director intent on making films from different genres. 8/10",

The Lost Weekend is a grimly realistic account of four days in the life of a chronic alcoholic, played by Ray Milland. In films of this quality one always takes away unforgettable images. The most striking is Milland&apos;s drunken efforts to remember where in his apartment the last hiding place he used is. Degraded and thoroughly beaten by his addiction, his last refuge is to try and keep it a secret from those who still love him. Billy Wilder&apos;s direction and script is brilliant - sympathetic, but unpatronising in his handling of a delicate and rarely dealt with affliction. Not until Nicolas Cage&apos;s portrayal of a man determined to drink himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas, has alcoholism been dealt with so well. Milland&apos;s performance is first rate - no hammy shlurring of words - and the atmosphere is dark and seedy like the bars he frequents. The scene where he spends several hours trying to find an open pawnshop on a public holiday is both harrowing and dazzling - it is remeniscent of the filmic image of a parched man trying to cross the desert.",

      "reviewBody": "I first knew of this film because of a quote at the beginning of a song. After a little research, I found that it came from this film and, finding the synopsis interesting, watched it. I found several other mind-blowing quotes, and a sense of fear that normally lies controlled under all the illusory security and freedom our governments force unto us via the media machinery and embedded social standards to keep the masses happy in their ignorance. I am not strange to that feeling, since I may know too much for my own good, and also like to do my best to fight this putrid system we were all born into. Punishment Park is shocking because it is happening. I&apos;ve seen it. While your average Joe rants about the increase in taxes while drowning his frustration in a can of beer, there are others who actually take action. And are at risk of suffering the torments of the so-called &quot;law&quot; in the name of a distorted justice and self-created ideals such as patriotism or morality. The &quot;judges&quot; portrayed in this film do exist, full of absurd and obsolete ideas, believing to be the voice of reason, while those who actually speak sense are treated like criminals, gagged and beaten by the arm of the law, individuals just like any other people who, by the almighty and imaginary power of state, are given the authority to command and do as they please with the common citizen. This movie is not a false documentary. It&apos;s a depiction of what has been happening for years in America, in Europe, in Asia, in every continent and with every government. You, thinking you can be as free as you can possibly imagine, whose biggest worries are what to have for dinner, take heed. The body lying on the pavement could be you, murdered by those who claim to come in the name of peace. &quot;At another time, the honorable thing or the right thing to do might be to be a policeman or to be President. Right now, I think the honorable thing to do is to be a criminal&quot;"

But if i can be permitted a bit of Trivial Observation: I had to watch the next to last scene (the police-escorted motorcade) again because i could not believe it on the first viewing. Did anyone else notice the rear projection in the back windows of the cars? The story is set in the 1930&apos;s, the cars are of that era but the automobile following in the back window looks like a 1950 Cadillac! Either that car window was a time tunnel or someone used the wrong film clip for the rear projection. That&apos;s why studios have a Continuity Department.",

      "reviewBody": "The tiny western settlement of &quot;Swan Creek&quot; is assigned a preacher from Montreal, idealistic John Bowers (as Arthur Wellington Moore). He arrives on a dry day, with an open umbrella and a mule. Since the Godless community has no place to worship, Mr. Bowers sets up his first sermon at the local watering-hole. In the saloon, Bowers meets rowdy ranch foreman David Butler (as Bill Hendricks). The men have a wild brawl and wind up wrestling on the floor. It turns out to be classic male-bonding. Afterwards, Bowers gently wipes the blood from Mr. Hendricks&apos; cheek and all is forgiven...\n\nShortly thereafter, when Hendricks cradles Bowers head after taking him to bed, you wonder what is going on between the men; director King Vidor shoots this like it&apos;s a love scene. The men look like they&apos;re about to kiss. Probably, they&apos;re just dealing with some latent issues. Both also seem attracted to pretty Colleen Moore (as Gwen). Sporting her pre-flapper Mary Pickford hair, Ms. Moore is the most fetching female on film. She suffers a mishap, but Christian love may provide a cure...\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the old titular term, or the 1968 anti-war anthem &quot;Sky Pilot&quot; by Eric Burdon &amp; the Animals, &quot;The Sky Pilot&quot; is a minister who provides guidance for your trip to heaven. This film has a good lead with Bowers, and Mr. Vidor ramps it up with interesting direction and good-looking production values. Moore is sweet, but Butler steals the performance honors as second lead. Oddly enough, it looks like Bowers would rather be with Butler than Moore. Bowers&apos; final scene with Moore reveals he&apos;s not at all satisfied with his partner. Just look at that man&apos;s confused and wary face...\n\n******* The Sky Pilot (4/17/21) King Vidor ~ John Bowers, David Butler, Colleen Moore, Harry Todd",

Those are for fans, and I don&apos;t consider them to be genuinely frightening. Session 9 is, most definitely, genuinely frightening. It takes place at a mental hospital that is legend where I live. So most people know what I&apos;m talking about when I say Danvers State Mental Hospital. It is one of the few psychologically affective movies that I&apos;ve ever seen. It takes the audience on a ride through a building that seems alive to it&apos;s visitors, and forces the audience to resolve for themselves why things are happening to each character. If you want a movie that is challenging and thought-provoking, this is the one. I always tell my customers to watch this movie in the dark, but not to watch it alone. Just be aware that if there is any distraction during the movie you&apos;ll have many questions about it. I hope you enjoy it as much I as do every time I watch it!",

      "reviewBody": "There was a time when music mattered, and the people that made that music mattered too. Bob Dylan was one of those people. Dylan has floated in and out of the public eye over the years, but has made somewhat of a return with the release of his 2001 album Love and Theft. He has tried to increase his current comeback, and extend his hand into another form of art, by written and staring in a new film.\n\nMasked and Anonymous is good no matter what your opinion of Bob Dylan may be. For Dylan fans this is a tour de force of film making. Written like a Dylan epic tune, think Desolation Row, Masked stays just out of reach of the explainable. Coupled with great cameos, Val Kilmer is far and away the best of many, Masked delivers. John Goodman and Jeff Bridges hold supply the majority of the nessecary acting with Luke Wilson helping out on occasion. However this is the Wilson of Old School, and a far cry from the Wilson of the Royla Tennebaums. None of that really matters, however, because this film was made for Bob Dylan, and he is the single most important character on screen.\n\nIn Jack Fate Dylan has created a chracter that personifies his style. Fate, an aging rock star returning home for a benefit concert, symbolizes what h as become of Dylan&apos;s career as a musician. Masked isn&apos;t really the story of Bob Dylan&apos;s life, no more then any of his songs are, it can be, however, his response to what his life has been like. The story itself lacks a little and the characters are never fully defined, but like the supporting acting none of that matters. The important part of Masked and Anonymous, and the only reason it was ever made, is Bob Dylan. Taken that way, Masked and Anonymous is a truly excellent, and original, piece of film."

There were some part in the film that I quiet did not understand but in reference to Streets of Fire but I highly recommend everyone to get Streets of Fire if you have not seen it. The music was incredible it was great to see a female that can act and actually sing and write songs!This film will definitely be another great cult classic the music rocks!

The general vibe is old-school, with enough blood to keep the viewer happy but no outright gore or torture. The set-ups are also classic : zombies, vampires, devil cults and the aforementioned killer clown. Segments range from 10 to 30 minutes, with no twists. The story lines are straightforward to a point and do not try to add to any mythos. But they all deliver with elegance and a lot of promise.\n\nBecause none of the sketches tries hard to surprise you, they&apos;re better left at their short running time, which is enough to be impressed by the directorial styles displayed. This explains why the Clown segment, the longest in the anthology, is also the weakest. It outstayed its weak set-up. The first and last segments, both tales from the undead, are also the slickest and nicely round up this hodgepodge of atmospheric, but almost too respectful quickies.",

And for the first half hour things move along quite effectively. We get some amazing visuals, mostly concerning mirrors, and good suspense too. Then, after that half hour mark, we get some truly boring dialog scenes and a lot of quarreling between our hero (who, according to me, seems to be a nice guy but a complete bore!) and an ex-colleague of his (he used to be a police but resigned after a shooting accident). Things pick up later in the movie, but the ending is a little bit of a let-down, because the build-up had so far been (mostly) very effective. But it is a nice idea for a horror story and well directed! Give it a try and I think you&apos;ll like it! :-)",

      "reviewBody": "Joris Ivens&apos; 1968 documentary, 17th Parallel, is compelling, albeit flawed, viewing. Filmed in co-operation (to put it mildly) with the North Vietnamese government at the height of America&apos;s involvement in the war, it recounts the struggles of the people who live along the 17th parallel or, as it was more commonly known at the time, the Demilitarized Zone. What makes it so fascinating to this American was it brought home just how little I knew about the people of Vietnam and how the war was seen from their point of view. Since the DMZ was pretty much ground zero, Ivens use of the relentless background noise of jets and artillery drives home the fact that the peasant&apos;s life was not an easy one, and the views of the extensive underground bunkers called home add to the understanding.\n\nThat said, Ivens, whose career spanned from the late &apos;20s to the &apos;80s with stints in the Soviet Union and Spanish Civil War, could capture war in excruciatingly uncomfortable ways. Particularly difficult are the 9 year old children with rifles and practicing their &apos;English&apos; to use when they confront soldiers, and the captured fighter pilot being marched through the village. However, this is obviously propaganda. We are given endless sequences of committee members aiding the proletariat, and their estimates of enemy killed and wounded are even more preposterous than ours were at the time. More odious than the propaganda we were creating (**cough**Green Berets**cough**)? Maybe not, still, it&apos;s a slice of history that does present an alternate viewpoint that is worth seeing for those that are interested.",

The movie is often very funny, despite the fact that there are lots of serious and painful stuff going on.\n\nIt&apos;s a Norwegian film based upon a series of short stories. I&apos;m no expert on film-making, but this director must really know his business, because I was completely unaware that I was watching separate stories. It felt very much like one single story even though it was jumping between different ones.\n\nThe movie has a very strong belief in the basic decency of people. This doesn&apos;t mean that there aren&apos;t people doing some bad things. There is no great evil going on here, but these are real people making mistakes and acting badly and hurting each other. But decency predominates. At the same time, there isn&apos;t any &quot;sappy-phoney-sentimentality&quot; present. All too often in Hollywood films when people are doing good things it feels rather contrived and is just in there to make the film commercial. In this movie, you do believe that the people in the film would actually do these good things. It&apos;s a Christmas movie, but it&apos;s 100% believable.\n\nThe movie is also educational. You&apos;ll learn why you don&apos;t buy your wife and your mistress the same Christmas present!",

      "reviewBody": "Director Cecil Howard&apos;s &quot;Firestorm&quot; is an intriguing blend of family melodrama, neo-noir, and steamy adult scenes. Released in 1984, the film stands as a defining example of 80s porn, offering a unique mix of storytelling and eroticism. While it has its share of flaws, &quot;Firestorm&quot; is an entertaining ride, especially for fans of the era&apos;s adult cinema.\n\nThe film&apos;s central plot revolves around a ghostwriter, Ken (played by Eric Edwards), who is hired to write a biography of a family matriarch, Kay Parker. However, the real draw is that Ken is also an incredibly skilled lover, leading to an underground network of wealthy women seeking his services. This intriguing premise sets the stage for a series of scorching sex scenes and a healthy dose of melodrama.\n\nOne of the film&apos;s standout performances comes from Rikki Harte, who delivers an amazing presence. Harte&apos;s interlude, where they break the fourth wall to declare that &quot;my daddy was a master thief,&quot; is a memorable moment that adds a touch of fun and surprise to the film. It&apos;s an unexpected twist that enhances the overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nThe cinematography in &quot;Firestorm&quot; is lush and artistic, with clearly stylistic lighting choices that enhance the on-screen antics. The sound quality is also commendable, with consistent sound levels and original songs created specifically for the production. These technical aspects elevate the film and showcase Howard&apos;s attention to detail.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its shortcomings. The non-linear narrative can be confusing, and the story feels convoluted at times. While the artistic merit is undeniable, there are some technical mishaps, such as lighting inconsistencies and a visible boom mic in a few scenes. These issues detract from the overall immersion and could have been addressed with more careful editing and attention to detail.\n\nDespite its flaws, &quot;Firestorm&quot; remains a significant entry in the adult cinema landscape. The ensemble cast, which includes notable names like Kay Parker, Sharon Mitchell, and John Leslie, delivers strong performances that elevate the eroticism and storytelling. The film is universally acclaimed as one of the last great X-rated movies to be released theatrically, and it&apos;s easy to see why.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Firestorm&quot; is a fun and fearless foray into 80s adult cinema. While it may not be perfect, it embraces its melodrama, showcases stunning visuals, and delivers on the steamy scenes. Rikki Harte&apos;s performance is a highlight, and the film&apos;s unique blend of genres makes it a memorable watch. For fans of vintage erotica and those seeking a different cinematic experience, &quot;Firestorm&quot; is definitely worth checking out.",

      "reviewBody": "Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn&apos;t get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.\n\nLike part one, &quot;chamber of secrets&quot; stays true to the book. I don&apos;t know about you - but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines, add or remove characters and do it for the &quot;sake of the art&quot;. I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys, so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So, after &quot;philosophers stone&quot; he delivered again!\n\nWhen reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness à la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh, so of course you won&apos;t see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again: all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right - even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well, let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there&apos;s no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn&apos;t imagine someone else playing their parts.\n\nGo see &quot;the chamber of secrets&quot;. It&apos;s pure fun and excitement! And it will wet your appetite for more to come. Richard Harris couldn&apos;t have asked for a better movie and legacy to be remembered by.",

In the thirties it was unusual to take a film camera out of the studio to make your film, but this is the case here,and the documentary shots are exceptional in clarity and contrast, much more than you expect from outdoors footage. Furthermore we move through the Danish province, which was seldom in Danish films. I have a nostalgia towards this. My childhood was in the fifties, but actually not much happened to geographical sites in those twenty years. The director comes from a career within silent movies, and dialog is not his strong point, but there is a general good humor and many happy smiling faces in this film, where the moral is &apos;Just take it easy, problems will solve themselves giving the time to act&apos;. This cheerfulness and lightheartedness makes you think, for just south of the border Hitler used the same romantic nationalism for quite a different purpose. His &apos;kraft durch Freude&apos; police eventually evolved into a strictly unhappy situation with violence and disaster. So watching this cheerful outdoors movie from 1936 kind of makes you think. It was the last chance to catch a happy folklore mood.",

      "reviewBody": "Harry D&apos;Abbadie d&apos;Arrast doesn&apos;t hang about with this tale of rags to riches that has loads of emotional baggage thrown in for good measure. &quot;Peggy&quot; (Nancy Carroll) is let down by her true love and takes the easy option by marrying the dull and staid millionaire &quot;Gibson&quot; (Frank Morgan) who guarantees her an easy, if uninteresting life. She&apos;s too restless a spirit for all of that, and although she resists the advances of the boyish and unstable sculptor &quot;Ralph&quot; (Glenn Anders) she is ready to jump ship when the carefree &quot;Lockridge&quot; (Fredric March) re-emerges into her life with a plan for her to escape her silk-clad drudgery and head for la Vie Parisienne - via some high jinx and a bit of burglary. Tempted, her life is thrown into turmoil by the daughter of her husband, &quot;Marjorie&quot; (Diane Ellis) who has a few designs of her own! This tries hard to straddle a few genres here, and whilst the dramatic aspects work well enough, the comedic ones prove a little beyond everyone to convincingly pull off. As the story progresses, even the usually reliable Morgan looks a little uncomfortable with the increasingly contrived nature of the plot within a plot within a plot. Also, by the end I&apos;d rather concluded that &quot;Peggy&quot; was no great shakes as an human being either. The production could fairly be described as embryonic and the photography seemed framed at times as if to allow the actors to read cue cards off-set the cameras - that looked a bit squinty. Still, it&apos;s all quite light-hearted and enjoyably enough paced to pass ninety minutes effortlessly.",

His whole life revolves around his newspaper. When an heiress, played by Loy, sues the newspaper for libel, Tracy puts William Powell to work, hoping that by photographing them together, he can convince Loy to drop the suit. But it will only work if Powell is a married man caught cheating, so Tracy convinces Harlow to marry him.\n\nHarlow is her usual feisty self. Powell is marvelous, especially in his fishing scenes, which are classics, especially the one in which he literally chases a trout through a stream. It&apos;s laugh out loud material if there ever was any. Loy has the least showy part, though she&apos;s quite beautiful and works well with Powell, portending great things to come.\n\nThis is a very enjoyable film with Tracy milking the comedy for all it&apos;s worth. Apparently his comedic work was a revelation back then, unlike today, when we know how adept he was at it.",

This movie is based on South African Humour, the acting isn&apos;t as bad as most people say, many people just doesn&apos;t understand this type of humour.\n\nThe movie was released in 1993, people must understand this was a really volatile difficult time in SA, and to have such a movie released, that clearly stretches racial barriers was a great risk, but it was worth it. Both Black and White South Africans found this extremely funny, and in a way it was able to overcome most racial barriers of the time.\n\nI have asked many of my black friends if they weren&apos;t offended when they watched it the first time and most said that they weren&apos;t, simply because it poked fun at all races. It was hilarious, and I have to agree, the best work of both actors&apos; careers.\n\nI can&apos;t see many people in other countries truly enjoying this if they don&apos;t understand South African Culture, but if you did enjoy it I&apos;m really glad! Again, this was made for a South African Audience on a small budget, that said, it still stays one of my favourite movies!",

      "reviewBody": "Things are not well with a young couple who live, together with their little child, in a villa near Genoa. The wife has a secret lover and while her husband is visiting the city on business, she is visited by a woman-a distant relative-who once lived in the same villa. The mysterious woman shares her memories with the wife and gives her somewhat contradictory advice about how to deal with her complicated love life.\n\n&quot;La Femme De Nulle Part&quot; (1922) ( The Woman From Nowhere ) is confirmation of the great and refined film style that can be seen in the films of Herr Louis Delluc. Alas, there are very few such films as the great French film director died very young.\n\nOn this occasion, Herr Delluc constructs an exemplary oeuvre of early silent virtuosity, typical of his exceptional work. &quot;La Femme De Nulle Part&quot; has a strong and imaginative film narrative wherein Herr Delluc uses numerous flashbacks to represent the different points of view of the three main characters. The mysterious woman&apos;s flashbacks illustrate the good times she had in the villa many years before. The wife of course must deal with her own adultery and we are also shown the doubts and sorrow of the husband away in Genoa on his business trip.\n\nThe film is about loss and missed opportunities and skilfully uses outdoor scenery to help create an atmosphere of larger than life romance. Frau Ève Francis as the woman from nowhere gives an appropriate performance under the supervision of Herr Delluc, her husband.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must get to know an unknown Teutonic rich heiress.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",

The titled character (Gene Wilder) decides to go to Transylvania and continue the research of a late relative. What follows is a comic joy-ride that involves the assistant (Marty Feldman), the love interest (Teri Garr), the stuck-up girlfriend (Madeline Kahn), the weird house-keeper (Cloris Leachman), the odd detective (Kenneth Mars) and naturally the monster himself (Peter Boyle in a priceless performance). Gene Hackman&apos;s whacked cameo as a the blind man who encounters the monster is one of the best sequences during the history of the cinema. A brilliant screenplay and beautiful black-and-white cinematography assist &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in being the total success that it is. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

      "reviewBody": "* 1/2 out of ****\n\nWhen it comes to pure charisma, the only Hong Kong actor who matches with Jackie Chan is Chow Yun-Fat (who is, overall, probably a better actor). What is it about Chan that appeals to so many people?  It&apos;s not only that he does all his stunts for real, but he seems like a natural, care-free, fun-loving kind of guy.  In every film he&apos;s been in, you can&apos;t help but notice his enthusiasm, even when he&apos;s starring in crap.\n\nAnd thus we segue to The Tuxedo, a sort-of spy spoof which Chan stars as Jimmy Tong, a reckless taxi driver with a crush on a woman working in an art exhibition.  Because of his top-notch driving skills, he&apos;s hired as Clark Devlin&apos;s (Jason Isaacs) personal driver.  Devlin is one suave fellow, with a fine tuxedo to boot, but he falls into a coma after an incident involving an explosive.\n\nTong, as his good friend and employee, feels obligated to find out what happened to his boss so he dresses himself in Devlin&apos;s tuxedo, which apparently enables the wearer superhuman ability and agility.  Posing as Devlin, Tong partners with a secret agent named Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) to expose a crime to poison the world&apos;s water supply.\n\nFor a good twenty or so minutes, the film is actually pretty enjoyable fluff, with a cool car &quot;chase,&quot; which is really just Chan driving real fast, but fun to watch, nonetheless.  However, once Hewitt is introduced as Chan&apos;s partner, the whole thing goes downhill with mindless blather about water. It seems the villain intends to poison the world&apos;s water supply so that only his bottled water is safe.\n\nUtter stupidity of the plan aside (poison water, ecosystem...dead, anyone?), it&apos;s just not the kind of set-up we want for a Chan flick.  This isn&apos;t the first film he&apos;s posed as a secret agent (see the far superior First Strike or Who am I?) but this time around, it ultimately drags the picture down. For one thing, the film&apos;s most interesting character isn&apos;t Chan, it&apos;s Isaacs&apos; Clark Devlin, who really is a cool and suave individual (Isaac himself has always been a very underrated actor).\n\nChan is his enthusiastic self as usual, but when it comes to performing nifty stunts, forget it, the stuff here looks too manipulated, which entirely defeats the charm of watching Jackie Chan take on countless opponents.  The humor isn&apos;t very good, either, with relentlessly predictable jokes (&quot;nice rack&quot;) and an astonishingly digressive segment involving Chan performing like James Brown, which is cringe-worthy, to say the least.\n\nLast, and possibly least, there&apos;s Jennifer Love Hewitt, who&apos;s a fairly pretty actress and as far as genuine talent goes...well, I&apos;ve seen much worse (Denise Richards, I&apos;m looking at you).  But here, she&apos;s just annoying, called on by the script to do nothing but whine and complain.  Worse yet, the movie never even opts to give us a good cleavage shot, which might have made the more annoying bits bearable.\n\nAs far as story goes, the plot is lame, the villains make zero impression, and the gadgets...well, the tuxedo IS the gadget and it&apos;s not a very impressive one, at that.  For superior martial arts entertainment, check out First Strike or Who am I?"

      "reviewBody": "Inspired by the real-life police strike in early-1980s Halifax, the obscure Canadian thriller &quot;Self Defense&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Siege&quot; is a hell of a good time for exploitation devotees. During this period of police inaction, criminal scum are able to do as they please. And so a gang of trouble-making bigots with a &quot;cause&quot; storm into a gay bar and terrorize the customers. Ultimately, almost all the victims end up dead, except for Daniel (Terry-David Despres), who flees for his life. He makes it inside an old apartment building. Initially, the residents are unsure of how to proceed, but soon they decide to shelter Daniel and fight back against the psycho antagonists, who are led by a stone-faced creep named Cabe (Doug Lennox, &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot;). And they prove to be decent fighters.\n\nIf this hadn&apos;t been a &quot;lost&quot; film for such a long time, this would surely have been considered a classic B flick over the decades. Directors Paul Donovan and Maura O&apos;Connell, who went on to do another cult flick, &quot;DEFCON-4&quot;, give the story great pace. In fact, the movie is so exciting, quickly paced, and manipulative (these filmmakers know how to push your buttons), that viewers can gloss over any flaws in the narrative and just enjoy the ride. Needless to say, it can get pretty violent, and there&apos;s some of the standard &quot;stupid characters doing stupid things&quot; tropes that people expect to find in many movies. But this viewer will say that it hooked him early on, and often delivered the goods.\n\nThe cast includes a few actors whom you may recognize from other things: Tom Nardini (&quot;Cat Ballou&quot;) as Horatio, Jack Blum (&quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot;) as Patrick (a blind kid with acute hearing), and Keith Knight (&quot;Class of 1984&quot;). Jeff Pustil, who was also in &quot;DEFCON-4&quot;, is an amusing highlight as the most aggressive of the bad guys. Daryl Haney is also a standout as the calm and cool Chester; you may better know him as a writer of such things as &quot;Crime Zone&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot;, and &quot;Xtro III: Watch the Skies&quot;.\n\nExcellent atmosphere and a haunting electronic score are assets. Worth noting is the tidbit of info that this apparently contains the only known existing news footage of that aforementioned police strike. There is also a priceless, final second twist before the end credits start appearing.\n\nEight out of 10.",

Though it&apos;s starring only unknown actors (most of them only played in this very movie - exception is of course Maria Singer as Magdalena Trenner), they seem like made for this role. You could think they play themselves in a film that is just a cut out copy of real life :)\n\nThe movie is called &quot;Die Scheinheiligen&quot; - &quot;The Hypocrites&quot;; and that&apos;s exactly like those people are: hypocritical.\n\nThe mayor with his &quot;bigger plan&quot; for the city (which stands above all). The policemen with their certain &quot;asshole on duty&quot; behaviour. The vicar with his &quot;be Christly and do what I say&quot; way of life. And so on, just see for yourself! I really have troubles expressing what I think about this movie. It&apos;s just the disgust about the &quot;bad guys&quot; and at the same time the laughter about the way the &quot;good guys&quot; through them a club in the way, that&apos;s what makes one enjoy this movie so much. A MUST for Bavarians, for all others still very recommended!\n\nSo long, Obeliks",

      "reviewBody": "Woody Harrelson plays a corrupt cop named &quot;Date Rape&quot; Dave (and for those of you still reading, we continue) who got the moniker not from doing so but rather for allegedly killing someone who did. He also lives in something one can only call a &quot;situation&quot; in which he married sisters (both at different times) had kids with each, divorced each and now insists that they all live under the same two roofs in homes right next to each-other. This leads to an awkward moment in which his daughter actually asks if their family is incest. Dave is also a cop that really likes to beat people down. Not just anyone mind you, everyone. Because he is not racist, he simply hates everyone. \n\nThe whole story focuses on Dave trying to beat a charge of victim abuse when a camera catches him beating the daylights out of a perpetrator that hit his car. All the while we watch Dave womanize, take drugs, smoke about two million cigarettes and try to get his two families to love him despite his disturbing life choices. \n\nDespite the disgusting things his character does Harrelson actually makes you feel bad for him in a few fleeting moments. All the while you know he deserves everything he gets and more but it&apos;s hard to hate him when he is watching television with his youngest daughter and cannot stop smiling at the thought of her wanting to be near him. The film is also packed with small roles by big names like Steve Buscemi and Sigourney Weaver who spice up the film but don&apos;t really add anything memorable. \n\nHarrelson makes the film watchable with an amazing performance and like a train wreck, is hard to take your eyes off. Unfortunately, Rampart is a gritty character study that is more repetition than self discovery. See Dave womanize, disgust his family, say shocking things, beat someone up, get wasted, freak out, rinse and repeat. He gets deeper into trouble with his family and career with each endeavor and never really learns anything from it. By the films end you realize Rampart suffers the same fate as Dave in that it&apos;s not going to change its ways and is ultimately headed nowhere. 5/10",

      "name": "Thrilling action and the best use of 3D since &apos;Avatar&apos;- pity the frenetic overplotting, the underwritten characters and most of all, an underused Jet Li)",
      "reviewBody": "Who better to attempt the world&apos;s first 3D &apos;wuxia&apos; movie than Tsui Hark- the man is behind some of the genre&apos;s most iconic representations like &apos;The Swordsman&apos;, &apos;Green Snake&apos; and &apos;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&apos;, and with the latter also a pioneer for introducing Hollywood- style special effects to Chinese cinema. It seems befitting therefore that almost thirty years later, Tsui Hark should be the one to import the latest Hollywood fad for the same genre- and true enough, the veteran director&apos;s maiden effort at the third dimension is nothing less than impressive.\n\nLike James Cameron, Tsui brings his considerable experience as a director to bear on the use of 3D to immerse his viewer into his cinematic vision. Gimmicks aside (yes, you&apos;ll still find all kinds of flying objects- wooden beams, arrows, knives and swords- coming straight at you), Tsui crafts each shot- static or moving- meticulously to create depth in every one of them and provide raison d&apos;etre for the use of 3D. Tsui has of course had some generous help from Hollywood expert Chuck Comisky (who oversaw the visual effects for &apos;Avatar&apos;), and the result is a milestone for the &apos;wuxia&apos; genre as well as for Chinese cinema.\n\nAlas for all its technical achievements, this loose remake of his classic &apos;New Dragon Gate Inn&apos; unfortunately is let down by more conventional elements like plot and character. As with his earlier movie, the setup here is also the gathering of three disparate groups of individuals at a trading post in the middle of the desert. On one hand, there is the vigilante Zhao Huai&apos;an (Jet Li), Zhao&apos;s female equivalent Ling Lanqiu (Zhou Xun), as well as a runaway palace maid Su (Mavis Fan) impregnated by the Emperor and therefore an assassination target by the Empress to preserve the lineage. On the other, there are the formidable Western Bureau troops, led by their fearsome commander Yu Huatian (Chen Kun), who have been sent by the Empress to kill Su and eliminate those opposed to the reigning monarchy.\n\nThe pursuit of the latter for the former leads their paths to cross with a ragtag group of bandits in search of ancient treasure buried under the sand near the inn. The advent of a once-in-60-years major sandstorm is supposed to unearth the treasure, and among those waiting to get a share of the riches are Gu Shaotang (Li Yuchun), Yu Huatian&apos;s doppelganger White Blade (also Chen Kun) as well as an intimidating Tartar warrior princess Buludu (Gwai Lun Mei) and her band of loutish tribesmen. Setting up such a sheer number of characters takes time, and a good half-hour is spent on exposition detailing these individuals and their relationships with each other. The effect of this after an exciting first half-hour watching Zhao assassinate the leader of the Eastern Front (Gordon Liu) and then finding himself outmatched by Yu is like adding a lead weight to the proceedings, so much so that what momentum the film had going for it is almost completely lost.\n\nPerhaps even more significant is that Jet Li is practically absent during this half-hour, and by the time he does reappear to join in the action-packed finale, it&apos;s too late for any significant characterisation to allow his crusading warrior Zhao Huai&apos;an to rise above the fray. There is a past romance hinted at with Zhou Xun&apos;s Ling, but Tsui provides too little elaboration on it- and if Jet Li&apos;s Zhao is thinly drawn, you can pretty much guess that the rest of the characters also suffer the same fate.\n\nNot only does this first reunion of Tsui Hark and Jet Li outside the &apos;Once Upon A Time in China&apos; series fail to create a cinematic icon like Wong Fei-Hung, it also gives Jet Li surprisingly little to do in the action department. As if hemmed in by the movie&apos;s title, Jet Li is almost always duelling only with his swords while performing some gravity-defying flight through the air, with ultimately too little of the lightning-quick hand-to-hand combat we&apos;ve come to love about the action star. Not to say that Yuen Bun&apos;s action choreography doesn&apos;t thrill (it does, especially with Tsui&apos;s ability to direct elaborate action sequences), but one hopes that Yuen (who was also behind Tsui&apos;s &apos;New Dragon Gate Inn&apos; back in 1992)- and his co-choreographers Lan Ha Han and Sun Jiankui- had exploited Jet Li&apos;s martial arts prowess for more.\n\nWhile it fails to capitalise on its key asset (i.e. Jet Li), the film does deliver some thrilling action sequences that blend old-school choreography with modern-day CG wizardry- the showdown between Zhao and Yu right in the middle of a raging sandstorm is an excellent example of this combination. Amid the wire-ful stunts, the excellently staged swordplay stands out- and it is Zhou Xun, rather than Jet Li, who impresses with her elegant moves. Kudos too to Choi Sung-fai&apos;s fluid cinematography and Yau Chi-wan&apos;s deft editing in all the elaborately staged action sequences- especially one which seamlessly intercuts between the action inside the inn and below the inn when the triumvirate first converge.\n\nIn terms of visual spectacle, Tsui Hark is definitely at the top of his game, both the action choreography and the initiation of 3D into the &apos;wuxia&apos; genre easily establishing itself as one of the must-see classics. Nonetheless, for all its technical achievements, this latest reworking of the &apos;Dragon Inn&apos; mythology is let down by its poorly drawn characters and at times its frenetic over-plotting of deceptions and double-crosses. And even as Tsui has more than proved his prowess with new-fangled Hollywood magic, one wishes that he had also not forgotten his faculty for old-school elements like plot and character- after all, it was these that made his 1992 &apos;New Dragon Gate Inn&apos; such an enduring masterpiece.",

      "name": "Shaw Brothers trying to do Golden Harvest",
      "reviewBody": "I remember the episode of a podcast I listened to about the fight between DC and Marvel and how during the 70s DC tried to copy Marvel&apos;s formula but just seemed to fail, since they just didn&apos;t understand what made Marvel&apos;s heroes so special. Well, there could be another episode about Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest, because without knowing too much about Shaw Brother&apos;s history, this film makes it quite obvious why they were out of touch while Golden Harvest just continued to deliver hit after hit.\n\nThe biggest problem with this film is the main character Fong Sai-Yuk/Fang Shih Yu (Yes, that Fong Sai-Yuk) - to put it simply, he&apos;s an idiot, he&apos;s really stupid, it&apos;s not even fun how stupid he is. He always wants to pick a fight with the Manchus, even if it could cause problem for his own people, he&apos;s the oldest in his class (the actor was 27 when this film came out.) and is probably supposed to be in his older teenage years, while the rest of the kids around him is 7-9 years old. He has to use both hands to write letters and also spin the paper around that he&apos;s writing on to finish the letters (and I don&apos;t think it got to do with the straps that kept him tied up from fighting). The only thing we know for sure is that he&apos;s amazing at fighting and there&apos;s never anytime you&apos;re worried for him, because he&apos;s really overpowered, even when it&apos;s him against 20-30 enemies, he just laughs it away like it&apos;s nothing.\n\nIt&apos;s really sad, because the fight scenes in this film (and there are many) are really great ones, amazingly choreographed and a nice flow to them. Gordon Liu as the Monk isn&apos;t in this film enough, because he&apos;s the character that saves this film (or at least tries to) because at the end of the film I just wanted the film to end, because this version of Fong Sai-Yuk was just the worst, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. While Jackie Chan in Drunken Master, Young Master or Dragon Lord starts off as a rascal, those films guides us through as he learns his mistakes and becomes a better person and finally able to defeat the big bad. In this film, Fong Sai-Yuk was just a bully all the way through, he didn&apos;t learn anything and the way he defeated the big bad in the end is just awful and cringeworthy.\n\nI really don&apos;t want to watch this film ever again.",

This gets the two into difficulty with their wives, and from there things build up into the kinds of predicaments that are familiar from their shorter features. What&apos;s rather impressive is how well they keep things going for so long. There&apos;s nothing that&apos;s forced or pointless, and the pacing is generally just right. As the wives, Mae Busch and Dorothy Christy have relatively easy roles, but they (and also Charley Chase) have a few good moments.\n\nAnyone who enjoys Laurel and Hardy&apos;s shorter features will probably also joining the &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot; in this amusing movie."

The play is dull, characters are flat, music is out of place.\n\nShould you watch it? If you had any illusions about Reinhold, you should. Be prepared to have your childhood idol crushed.",

And I had a lot of expectation from this movie too. But unfortunately I&apos;ll have to say this was one of the worst movies I saw in recent times. Right from the first scene it seemed like a drowning ship. Throughout the movie audience kept on expecting that now the ship will get itself floating. But with every minute it kept on going down. Audience were laughing in serious moments of the movie. But it seemed like it was trying to save itself (specially during song sequences, dance by Hrithik is only little good thing about the movie). After two hours of movie the movie ship is already drowned. And then it seems the whole crew gives a last attempt of salvage, without understanding that its already underwater. In last half an hour of the movie Jackie has given a credible performance. But at the end it was the biggest disappointment of the year. Sorry to the Hrithik fans.",

      "reviewBody": "I guess not only Hollywood is keeping an eye for potential comic book series or graphic novels to turn into movies, and for Japan, this had already been something ongoing given its rich manga culture with immense material to tap upon, with the latest and most popular here being the Death Note movies which had even spawned its own movie spin off L: Change The World, albeit to varying result. And the rule of thumb of course is to snag a heartthrob in your leading role, and you more or less have it made. In today&apos;s screening, Tomohisa Tamashita&apos;s popularity in the titular role got measured by the audible shrieks and wistful sighs each time he comes on screen, even in the nerdiest of disguises.\n\nTomohisa Yamashita plays Kurosaki, a man whose family was destroyed by swindlers, hence his deep hatred for the group. He follows in the steps of Bruce Wayne, though more focused in his vigilantism, targeting only con artists in a bid to do his own Robin Hood work, conning them back and reimbursing the respective victims. There are various categories of conmen, such as white for those out for riches, red for those out to steal hearts, and black for those who con other con artists.\n\nFor someone who hasn&apos;t read the manga, or followed the television series, this movie was quite a challenge for me to follow. Granted there was an origin flashback worked into it, but it served to confuse the current entanglement with its chief villain Ishigaki Tetsu, played by Naoto Takenaka, whom most will recognize as the sensei character in Waterboys or Swing Girls. Being a standalone movie, it tells of the despicable acts that Ishigaki commits, in creating bankruptcy fraud, and how Kurosaki has him set in his sights for some black swindling, with a hunter after an extremely cunning prey.\n\nThose without background knowledge will find adequate scenes in which a lot of questions will be asked. For starters, almost all the female characters here were treated second class, and not enough, despite its slightly more than 2 hours runtime, being focused on them. They come and go, and frankly speaking, could be done without as they don&apos;t hurt the plot an iota. Next, and I&apos;m guessing here, is the love-hate relationship that Kurosaki has for his informer/con-master Katsuragi. While they exchange frequent notes on Shakespeare&apos;s Julius Caesar, it&apos;s hardly linked to, nor presents itself as a proper metaphor on the issue of trust which they&apos;re harping on, either that or the essence of it got lost in translation.\n\nScenes such as those mentioned, which require a lot more background knowledge, tend to overindulge themselves, hence alienating severely first time visitors to The Black Swindler&apos;s role. Some like Bayside Shakedown obviously makes it easy for non-fans/series followers to grasp and enjoy the ride, but The Black Swindler seems to have stamped itself strictly for those in the know only (or fans of Tomohisa Tamashita). Unless of course we decide to pick up the pieces from the established television series.",

      "reviewBody": "On thing I don&apos;t understand is why is Peeter Simm so celebrated as a film director in Estonia almost like he&apos;s the greatest filmmaker ever risen on the shores of Baltic Sea. His best film is children&apos;s movie &apos;Arabella&apos; (that itself is wonderful film actually), but rest of his work is mediocre at best, and &apos;The Lonely Island&apos; is even worse. This could be his worst film of all times, and it is very close to be one of the worst Estonian film of all times (there are quite close competition on that place, but I can&apos;t say for sure as I haven&apos;t seen all the films).\n\nThe film had a nice general idea about loneliness and show different people and stories and how they are all tied together - similar formulas have been tried many times before (and with much better results). What we have here is a mess. No direction and sloppy editing can confuse the viewer at first, but when he gets used of the rhythm (or lack of the rhythm of the film) it is possible to follow the stories. As all the stories progressing one short scene at the time and they are all mixed together, we are shown too much unnecessary stuff and no useful information what could help viewer to understand the characters better.\n\nThen the actors - what&apos; with all that dubbed voices. I understand that there were Latvian and Belarussian actors in it, but all the dubbing made the film sound ridiculous (it already looked ridiculous). Even the voices of Estonian actors were coming through like some filter that muffled and distorted them. Even the other sound were added later - like the police cars sirens (it is a film, but reality the sirens are different, or a super bike sounding like motor cross bike (that is the final drop for me to give one star to the film), and all sorts of that stuff.\n\nThere were two or three brilliant moments, but the vanished in this mess like a drop of water in the desert.",

      "reviewBody": "Roy Scheider is a cheating husband who complicates life for his political hopeful wife, Ann Margret.  She gives a many faceted performance, and you&apos;ll cheer when she gets in touch with her feelings about cheating husbands. John Glover plays a villain, and he will leave a bad taste in your mouth. He does an excellent job being the bad guy, you&apos;ll never forget him in this role.  Roy Scheider is cast into a world of sleazy women, cliche&apos; stereotype gay men and conscience free killers.  Clarence Williams III (he played Prince&apos;s father in Purple Rain) is ironicly cast as Vanity&apos;s boyfriend in this movie.  (Vanity was originally cast for the female lead in Purple Rain, but left Prince during production. &apos;The Beautiful ones always smash the picture&apos;.)  Clarence has an interesting scene with Vanity and a teddy bear. This is Vanity&apos;s best work as an actress, she was the perfect casting choice in this role. She plays a nudie model in a sleazy pay by the hour polaroid porn house.  She debuts talent here, as well as her first breast enhancement surgury. She&apos;s at her finest for those who love her for her sexy image, but she has some fine acting moments.  She does not turn in any musical performances, for those of you who care.  It doesn&apos;t take much to shock me, but Kelly Preston&apos;s (now Mrs. John Travolta) moments onscreen were hardcore...  Let&apos;s just say graphic is the best way to describe it. That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying about that...  You&apos;ll see recognizable porn actors &amp; actresses in their element, and you&apos;ll feel for Ann Margret&apos;s character. See this movie."

I mean the scenes are obviously set up and acted. For example: A boy takes some shirts and runs through the alleyways followed by the camera. But as he turns into a street, the camera rises up above the rooftops to follow him running into the distance. Maybe my own expectations that a documentary should portray true events is too narrow, I don&apos;t know.\n\nI found the selfishness displayed by some of the characters depressing. The inability of others to recognize this behavior for what it was could only be explained by stupidity. This is not my idea of entertainment but, of course, this is a documentary.\n\nI read that this film has won the IDA-Humanitas Award so it must be a good representation of life in the slums of Jakarta. Or maybe it was the final touching scene, which makes you think about what is really important, that earned the prize.",

Well, if insane car chases are your cup of tea, then you&apos;ll love this for sure. Cars flip, spin, screech, explode and perform all manner of hair raising feats in this adrenaline pounding ride. Unfortunately, it has to be said that there is very little substance other than the aforementioned so if you are requisite of character development, a more abstruse plot and good performances then it would probably be wise to look elsewhere.\n\nWhilst certainly not one of my personal favourites from PM&apos;s extensive catalogue, this is nonetheless worth a look for fans of automobile chaos and awesome GENUINE (as opposed to lazy CGI crap!) stuntwork.",

      "reviewBody": "Oliver Stone has always had a special bond with Vietnam. He is a veteran of that war and the theme about a veteran trying to cope with his war experiences is a subject that comes back in several of his movies. This is the last movie in his Vietnam trilogy. His first movie was &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), his second &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989) and the third one was &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; (1993).\n\nIn Heaven &amp; Earth he tells the true story of a Vietnamese village girl who survives a life of suffering and hardship during and after the Vietnam war. Before she meets and marries the U.S. marine Steve Butler, she already has had an entire life behind her. She once fled for the violence of the Viet Cong, leaving her farming village for Saigon together with her mother. But soon she disgraced herself by becoming pregnant with her new master&apos;s child and as an unmarried mother, she tried to make a living by being a freedom fighter, a hustler and sometimes a prostitute. As soon as they are married, they move to the USA, but life on the other side of the ocean certainly isn&apos;t as perfect as she imagined it to be...\n\nSome people say that it is a good thing that Oliver Stone has finally made a movie that shows the Vietnamese perspective of the war and I agree, but only to a certain extend. It&apos;s true that we only get to see movies that show the American side of the story and that we need other movies that give us a broader view on the matter, but &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; isn&apos;t the only &apos;reversed&apos; Vietnam film. Perhaps not many people know this, but the French movie &quot;Indochine&quot; (1992) does approximately the same. The main difference with &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; is that it doesn&apos;t talk about the &apos;American&apos; period, but about the French colonial period that proceeded it and in which time the Vietnam war really started (The French had almost lost all their battles when the Americans came to help them and thereby got completely stuck into the war themselves...). \n\nBut it is true, Oliver Stone has done a nice job with this movie. He has made it an interesting character study, with the war always present in the background. The acting is very good and I don&apos;t think there could have been a better actor than Tommy Lee Jones to play the role of Major Steve Butler. The other actors all did a good job too, in fact, I might say that Stone has had an excellent cast to work with and he probably got the most and the best out of them.\n\nIf there is one lesser point to this movie, although only a small one, than it must be the language. The Vietnamese all start by speaking almost perfect English to each other, but when they speak to Americans their English is poor, yet when they speak to each other in front of an American its in Vietnamese. I believe it would have been better if Stone had chosen to let the Vietnamese speak their own language all the time and to speak with an accent when speaking to the Americans. But as I already said, I only see this as a minor detail and it certainly didn&apos;t spoil the good times that I had with this movie. This is an underrated movie that deserves to be seen by a great audience. I give it a 7.5/10 at least, perhaps even an 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Here is a large portion from a meritorious cinematic record, produced by Belgian documentarian Henri Storck, and shot over a two year period during 1958/9, of a generally unknown region within the Belgian Congo, one little inscribed through change, an anthropologically seasoned film benefiting from sponsorship given by King Leopold III of Belgium beneath the auspices of that nation&apos;s splendid International Scientific Foundation. Eminent zoologist Heinz Sielmann shares both directing and writing responsibilities with Henry Brandt, the pair capably assisted by a team of German cameramen who have compiled a good deal of unusual footage from within the large East African forested section of the erstwhile Belgian colony, subsequently to be designated as Zaire, along with fragments of Rwanda and Burundi. One of two attractively packaged and thoroughly interesting assemblages of nature-in-the-raw flavoured cultural documentation created by Sielmann (the other: VANISHING WILDERNESS), this work depicts complex interplay between indigenous peoples and wildlife, within what is now referred to as the Democratic Republic of Congo, an area concentered by an active volcanic range, jungle and savanna flanking it upon either side, the work featuring special diversion offered to viewers by means of staged folkways of local tribal forest residents. Scenes of unique behaviour on display from jungle fauna are interlaced with those of local natives who strive to establish mystical connections between animals and men; additionally, one of the strongest contributions representative of Sielmann&apos;s craft is a result of his 18 months of filming various gorilla family groups, a groundbreaking project that resulted in altering a widespread perception held of this simian from a merely dangerous beast into a very social and rather peaceable creature. The animal sphere also furnishes memorable episodes of such as an aardvark, nocturnally photographed while utilizing its spearlike two foot long tongue to seize and ingest large numbers of termite ants, and a hornbill that interns its mate inside of a tree, by means of mud daubing, for three months following birth of their young, an act of imprisonment symbolically applied within marital customs of regional tribes. An English language version of the film, entitled MASTERS OF THE CONGO JUNGLE (based upon a claim of local natives that &quot;We are the lords of the forest&quot;) employs a tandem of stentorian voiced narrators, Orson Welles and William Warfield, providing more than enough basso tone to produce a dramatic accounting of the filmed activity, in spite of a written text by hack Joe Wills that is beleaguered with his regrettable tendency to compose phantasma from rather pedestrian activities of local denizens, although Welles adds welcome humour.",

      "reviewBody": "Now here&apos;s something cool! &quot;Les mémés cannibales&quot; (&quot;Rabid Grannies&quot; in English) is mostly a schlock-fest, but also poking fun at the lives of rich people. A pair of kindly old women are having their birthday party with the relatives present, but one of the presents is from a devil-worshiping nephew, and its contents turn both women into bloodthirsty monsters! Go figure! \n\nThe movie reminded me of Peter Jackson&apos;s &quot;Braindead&quot; (called &quot;Dead-Alive&quot; in the US) just a little bit, with also just a faint hit of the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; movies. The movie also lampoons the family&apos;s greed. For the most part, though, I think that the people making the movie just wanted to have fun and see what sorts of things they could show. The dubbing is terrible, but who cares about that? All in all, it&apos;s a very fun, disgustingly hilarious flick. Just the sort of movie for Troma to release."

      "reviewBody": "Yes, every film these days isn&apos;t just a film. It&apos;s the beginning of a larger body of work, a shared universe, or trying to set up an ongoing franchise. And, besides the Marvel Shared Universe and a few pre-existing properties like &apos;Star Wars,&apos; most fledgling film franchises struggles beyond the first offering. That&apos;s simply because they make setting up a wider universe more of a priority than actually simply telling a good story (that &apos;Dark Universe&apos; saga that tried to get off the ground with Tom Cruise at the helm, anyone?).\n\nNow, I&apos;m not going to say that the producers of &apos;Alita: Battle Angel&apos; wouldn&apos;t love the franchise to still be going in ten years time (complete with all sorts of spin-off tales of secondary characters and probably a TV series to boot), but at least it stands on its own as a great story and - if it doesn&apos;t get a sequel - can be looked at as a whole, rather than something that started and was never concluded.\n\nIt&apos;s set well into the future where the world has been ravaged by one giant war (aka &apos;The Fall&apos;) and half the (unlucky) population live in a junkyard of a city on Earth, while those better off live in a floating city above it, known as &apos;Zolum.&apos; The status quo remains until a Dr Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) who specialises in creating cyborgs out of spare parts finds the remains of a young cyborg girl (&apos;Alita,&apos; in case you haven&apos;t guessed!) on the scrap heap and takes it upon himself to rebuild her. Of course the plot needs her to have forgotten who true identity and - naturally - this all links in with what will become her destiny to bring a little more equality between the two last cities on Earth and the mysterious ruler who &apos;watches all.&apos;\n\nSo, it&apos;s kind of one of those &apos;prophecy/saviour&apos; type films which certainly aren&apos;t that original, but, if done right, are very entertaining - and Alita is very entertaining. First of all Rosa Salazar is a very likable lead and, despite not having too many major roles to her credit, does brilliantly at holding the weight of the story on her shoulders. She&apos;s also got on hand Christoph Waltz, who always turns in a great performance in whatever he&apos;s in. This is no different and their relationship is the character-highpoint of the film.\n\nAlita&apos;s love interest is &apos;Hugo&apos; (Keean Johnson) and, although I couldn&apos;t really find fault with anything about his performance, I got the impression that his part could have been played by anyone. Jennifer Connelly is on the cast-list, but I felt she was a little underused and could have been in it a lot more. And, despite being a big fan, I only found out that Jackie Earle Haley was in the film after seeing his name on the credits and having to look up who he played online afterwards\n\nIt&apos;s all stylishly directed by Robert Rodriguez, despite having James Cameron as co-producer and writer, the directoral honours seemed to have gone to Rodriguez. His natural style of fast-paced shots work better for the action and amount of CGI used. I know Cameron did - practically - an entire film (&apos;Avatar&apos;) in CGI, but in Alita (and this could just be because a more modern film can blend live action and computer effects together) better, the effects look for more polished and real when compared to &apos;Avatar.&apos; The soundtrack is also pretty generic and you certainly won&apos;t be humming the theme tune for months to come after leaving the cinema.\n\nBut, that&apos;s just a minor gripe. Basically, if you&apos;re in the mood for some great action and don&apos;t mind the lengthy two-hour run-time, you should definitely check this one out. After only a couple of scenes you&apos;ll stop wondering why Alita&apos;s eyes are so (CGI) big and concentrate on her growth as a character (and, is it just me, or is she using &apos;Sting&apos; i.e. the sword from &apos;Lord of the Rings&apos; to save the world?).\n\nI see that it&apos;s only got a big of a lukewarm reception from some critics, but, if you see what the fans are saying about it, I think you&apos;ll know who to believe. Bring on the next installment.",

      "reviewBody": "You will have to look hard and long for a film that&apos;s as quirky as Killer Joe. William Friedkin must have been inspired by the equally quirky Fargo in doing this film.\n\nBoth films are about people who get into criminal enterprises that really don&apos;t have the talent. Bill Macy decides that good way out of his financial difficulty is to arrange to have his wife kidnapped and his rich father-in-law extorted for the ransom in Fargo. In Killer Joe, young Emile Hirsch goes into the drug dealing business and owes some big bucks to some nasty people. So a quick way to some ready cash is to kill his mother and get her insurance policy via the backdoor as his sister Juno Temple is the beneficiary. \n\nMajor difference between Fargo and Killer Joe is that Macy and his family are good middle class Minnesotans. Hirsch, Temple, their father Thomas Haden Church and his second wife Gina Gershon are Texas lowlife trailer park trash. The first wife, the mother of Hirsch and Temple is Julia Adams and truth be told no one is really going to mourn the passing of this one in any event.\n\nHirsch even has a hit man picked out. It&apos;s Matthew McConaughey who is a Dallas police detective and doubles as a hit man on the side. He&apos;s both mysterious and dangerous and gradually inserts himself into their family group, especially since he demands as a retainer the nubile body of Juno Temple in lieu of the cash they don&apos;t have until a settlement comes forth.\n\nJust like Fargo everything and anything that can go wrong does with this foolproof scheme thought of by a fool. If I had to single anyone out in the cast it&apos;s Emile Hirsch who is a degenerate and a lowlife, but still you feel a bit of sympathy for him because he&apos;s so pathetically dumb. And McConaughey in the title role will also make you take notice.\n\nKiller Joe while not as good as Fargo is still good enough to savor. I agree with another reviewer who says you will either like it or hate it, but won&apos;t be indifferent.",

      "reviewBody": "The story wasn&apos;t seamless and seemed to be multiple patches stitched together. The songs were the worst I heard or seen in years. If Gunashekhar wants to be recognized for his skills, he needs a clear vision. Almost all through the movie, it seemed like the director wasn&apos;t clear about what he wants or that he couldn&apos;t extract it from the actors and the other artists. I hate to compare one director with other but I feel justified to compare any director with Rajamouli. That is because I am not comparing their skillset but their commitment. Rajamouli doesn&apos;t sleep till the gets the shot to his 100% satisfaction(At least to his satisfaction, may not be to audience&apos;s satisfaction). Looks like Gunashekar needed only 70% in most places to okay a scene. \n\n3D was very good for the 1st Telugu film and VFX was good in parts but felt they could have been avoided in some places. \n\nThe movie felt like a 80s movie made with modern technology. The screenplay needs to be tight and logical. \n\nThe fight sequences though showed promise in some places, were too gross and ugly in others. Especially where Rudramadevi keeps on fighting standing on the spears amidst the Snake formation. Simple question, will not the enemy soldiers retract their spears at least to protect themselves?\n\nThe fate of the fight between the enemy king and Chalukya Veerabhadrudu was inconclusive. This shows how patchy the editing was. \n\nAllu Arjun was, as expected, flawless while the story was far from b being such. \n\nFor those who think that the move was a spectacle because it had to be made within the contours of history, I disagree such a view because the story quite liberally removed every contour except the names of the historical characters. The story was COMPLETELY FICTIONAL. We can find from history that Rudramadevi was brought up as if she was a boy and that she ruled with the name &apos;Rudradeva&apos; but not that even she was unaware of her physiology or that everyone else was fooled to believe that a girl was a boy and worse that a woman was a man. The disappointing part was that most part of the story was focused on this transformation between boy and girl and how she swaps roles. History never said that Gona Ganna Reddy was a Bandit. He was a revenue collector i.e a designated official and feudatory of Rudramadevi. These are very crucial aspects that help understand the history of the period. With this movie the history has been twisted beyond the red line. History doesn&apos;t agree that Rudramadevi built a multi-phase city walls. I think the Gunasekhar&apos;s city walls were inspired from Chanakya&apos;s Arthashastra.\n\nI personally feel that a director has to be very responsible with his story when they are presenting a historical narration especially when the genuine one is not really popular. We can twist and turn Mahabharata because people can make out which part is fiction. But in case of Rudramadevi, very few people know the history. Such fictional movies will be considered history. Some of the reviews and comments is the proof.\n\nGunasekhar surely has talent but he just lacked the vision and clarity in this movie. Looks like he was very complacent.",

      "reviewBody": "John Philip Sousa was not only America&apos;s &quot;March King,&quot; he was a skilled organizer and entertainer who also composed much music now thoroughly unknown to most Americans (and fans elsewhere).  His life spanned the era of an optimistic, brash America where live music was the only music to the burgeoning and eventually triumphant victory of an insatiable technology that even in Sousa&apos;s lifetime was employed to record almost everything. Sousa benefited from the new world of recording and he can be heard on compact disc in his later years conducting his famed quasi-military band.\n\n20th Century Fox enlisted a cadre of fine performers for a seamlessly entertaining biopic of John Philip Sousa with a nice, anachronistically innocent, fictional romance interwoven with the band leader/composer&apos;s story.\n\nAs Sousa Clifton Webb brings to life a character who was, as in reality, ambitious and driven to succeed.  Sousa left the Marine Corps, where he led The President&apos;s Own, to start his hand-picked band.  In uniforms which the leader designed, the outfit mirrored great military bands (of which the U.S., as opposed to England, had a clear shortage during Sousa&apos;s life). Sousa understood the importance of touring and he was light years ahead of the twentieth century&apos;s pops ensembles in making his musicians - and his music - as ubiquitous as travel of his day allowed.\n\nSousa&apos;s patient and adoring wife, Jennie, is well played by Ruth Hussey.\n\nA nice romantic plot is the courtship of aspiring singer Lily Becker and the alleged inventor of the sousaphone, Willie Little.  Lily is the gorgeous Debra Paget and Willie the young and upcoming Robert Wagner.  Neither character existed in real life but their romance is well threaded into Sousa&apos;s story and is coyly affecting.\n\n1952 was a hard year for many Americans.  A self-designated lame duck president presided over an unpopular war, the first in our history in which victory in the traditional military sense wasn&apos;t a strategic or political objective.  &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; was a refreshing patriotic film that didn&apos;t require thinking about the realities of the day.  I remember seeing it as a kid and loving every minute.  I still watch it occasionally.\n\nCredit also goes to the producer and to director Henry Koster for including a scene at an Atlanta festival where a black chorus sings The Battle Hymn of the Republic under Sousa&apos;s baton right after a rousing version of Dixie was performed.  This was two years before Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court&apos;s belated start of the final assault on the obscenity of legalized racial discrimination.  I doubt everyone in the South felt good about that scene.\n\nMusical pieces are well interwoven with the story and the final minutes have Sousa&apos;s most famous march, also the movie&apos;s title, played with a segue from his band to contemporary marching marines and soldiers. His superimposed spectral leading is a fine reminder of his role.  A very nice touch.\n\nFolks who only know Sousa from a relative handful of oft-performed and wonderful marches should check out his less well-known music.  NAXOS is currently releasing a series of CDs of works that reflect Sousa&apos;s extraordinary creativity.  But above all, Americans owe him an everlasting debt for composing stirring music that still animates listeners as it did when first performed under his baton.\n\n10/10",

But my friends and I decided to check it out and I&apos;m actually glad that I saw it. As silly story that it is and a bit predictable, it&apos;s a good movie. Most romantic comedies tick me off because they are so predictable and the it&apos;s the same formula each time, Penelope is close to the same formula, but instead adds a fairy tale twist. It has the same moral of the story as most films of having to accept yourself, but Christina Ricci made it more charming and lovable. The cast was perfect and all did a great job, the looked like they had such a good time bringing this story to life.\n\nPenelope seems like the girl that should be living the high life, a wealthy family, part of royalty, but her life isn&apos;t perfect. Due to a shallow mistake her ancestor made, a witch cursed a face of a pig onto the next born daughter, that happens to be Penelope who apparently has to marry a man of royal blood to break the curse. But since she&apos;s not the prettiest face on the planet, every man runs from her, but Max, a spy sent by a photographer, Max learns that Penelope is a beautiful soul. Penelope runs away though to find her freedom and instead finds herself and how wonderful she truly is.\n\nPenelope is a very cute film, I was very impressed with the story, there were some things I was a little disappointed in, like how they just abandoned some characters for no reason. But I think it&apos;s hard to fit it in a short film, still I think it could have been edited better. But Christina Ricci was a great choice for Penelope, even though she&apos;s still oddly enough not the ugliest woman I&apos;ve ever seen with the nose, she did a good job and held her own well. Reese Witherspoon, small role, but she was so charming. I would recommend Penelope, it&apos;s a cute film and was a lot of fun to watch.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "What&apos;s funny about dodgeball? First, it&apos;s a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe&apos;s gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.\n\nThis is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult, the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot-the-cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.\n\nThe first time I saw this film, I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.\n\nWhy only a 6 rating? Despite the campiness and good solid humor, this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two.\n\nStrongly recommended - for one viewing!",

      "name": "Lubitsch takes on Anne Boleyn",
      "reviewBody": "1920&apos;s &apos;Anna Boleyn&apos; was hardly one of those films doomed from the get go or anything. Ernst Lubitsch was a great director, whose best work in the 30s and 40s in principally comedy and romantic comedy is truly fantastic. Also think very highly of Emil Jannings, a silent film great and a regular of FW Murnau primarily. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn were two of the most interesting historical figures and monarchs, Anne Boleyn is the most well known of his six wives and it&apos;s no wonder.\n\nSo actually there was a good deal that &apos;Anna Boleyn&apos; had going for it. My conclusions after seeing it fairly recently was that it was pretty decent with a lot of things working in its favour, it is an interesting film and worth seeing if you want to see Lubitsch early on in his career when he was doing silent films. Yet considering the director and subject, &apos;Anna Boleyn&apos; also could have been better and there are far better representations of Lubitsch overall and even during this period.\n\nWill start with the not so good things about &apos;Anna Boleyn&apos;. The pace can be erratic, a lot of things are covered and the handling of all the events covered read of depict this event, do a little with it but not deeply enough and then suddenly go onto the next event in a jumpy way, which made some of the storytelling choppy.\n\nIt is slightly bland at times, the sophistication is there but that is pretty much it when it comes to how Lubitsch&apos;s style comes across here. This was at a point where he was still properly finding his style and his strengths and experimenting instead, and while his direction is actually pretty good there&apos;s not an awful lot that&apos;s distinct.\n\n&apos;Anna Boleyn&apos; has a good deal of great things though. It looks mighty impressive, even now, with very lavish costumes and sets. Captured intimately, while keeping it simple, and fluidly on camera. Lubitsch&apos;s direction may not be distinct yet but it&apos;s hardly indifferent or ill at ease and handles the big moments quite well. Although Henny Porten is agreed too old for the title role, she is still regal and affecting and doesn&apos;t make Anne stock or a caricature (even if she does overdo it at times). Jannings is suitably imposing, one watches him in awe and fear portraying this fascinating yet difficult monarch.\n\nThey work beautifully together in regard to their chemistry. The acting didn&apos;t seem too histrionic or static and interaction seemed natural. The story is far from perfect by any stretch, but it compels enough and kept me entertained and moved enough. It&apos;s played straight which is appropriate for the subject. The outcome is not in doubt for anybody that knows anything about Anne Boleyn, but that doesn&apos;t stop the final moments leaving me misty-eyed. The music could have had more breathing space but did appreciate that it didn&apos;t go over the top in instrumentation or mood.\n\nOverall, not great but worth a look for anybody interested in seeing early Lubitsch. 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;All my films have started with an image,&quot; says director Andrea Arnold. &quot;It&apos;s usually quite a strong image and it seems to come from nowhere. I don&apos;t understand the image at first or what it means, but I want to know more about it so I start exploring it, try and understand it and what it means. This is how I always start writing.&quot; What does the image of a fish tank conjure up for you? On the inside longing to look out, is fifteen-year-old Mia. Trapped in a housing estate. Trapped in a single parent family. Trapped by people around her she can&apos;t respect. Trapped in herself. For being fifteen. She has her own inner world, fighting to manifest itself . Fortified by cigarettes and alcohol she can kick in the door of the empty nearby flat. A bare floor. Her CD player. Practice her moves. A better dancer than those kids on the block she just nutted.\n\nMia is quite content to carve out her own double life, f*ck you very much! Never mind she gets caught and nearly comes to grief trying to steal a horse. And social workers don&apos;t scare her. But mom&apos;s new boyfriend – that could be a pain! A real spanner in the works. Especially when he&apos;s so annoyingly nice.\n\nUnder Andrea Arnold&apos;s hand, life on this inner city concrete backwater is suddenly very alive. Banalities become beautiful. Like sunlight through cracked glass. Vibrant, gritty and riveting, but in a way that entertains powerfully. As pulsating and funny as Trainspotting but without the yuck factor. Its momentum is overpowering. We never know what is going to come out of Mia&apos;s mouth or where events will lead. Each jaw-dropping new scene surprises yet seems the result of inexorable momentum. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, the story mercifully avoids kitchen-sink drama, excessive violence, drugs, getting pregnant, grand larceny, car crashes and all the other cliché-ridden devices to which cinema-goers are usually subjected. Tightly controlled, Fish Tank attacks with a potent and thought-provoking arsenal of story-telling.\n\nAndrea Arnold proved she could do hard-hitting realism with her award-winning debut, Red Road. Here she excels her earlier efforts but still imbibes many of the verité approaches and senses of discipline that have filtered down from the Dogme and Advance Party movements. Her &apos;strong initial image,&apos; or lack of subservience to more traditional methodology, maybe reminds of the devotion to experimental, avant-garde cinema taken by artists-turned-filmmakers such as Steve McQueen (Hunger) or theme-over-story technicians such as Duane Hopkins (Better Things). Michael Fassbender, who took reality to new heights as Bobby Sands in Hunger, here plays the mystifying and warmly charismatic Connor (Mum&apos;s boyfriend).\n\nArnold didn&apos;t allow actors to read the script beforehand. They were given their scenes only a few days before filming. For the part of Mia, she chooses a complete unknown with zero experience. Arnold spotted Katie Jarvis at a train station after drawing a blank with casting agencies. &quot;She was on one platform arguing with her boyfriend on another platform, giving him grief.&quot; However the performance is achieved, Jarvis is electrifying. If Arnold wanted a &apos;real&apos; person for the role, this seventeen-year-old takes over the screen with raw adolescent power. Says Arnold, &quot;I wanted a girl who would not have to act, could just be herself.&quot; Fish Tank will lift you out of your seat and on an unstoppable flight, ricocheting against confines of circumstance and imploding a dysfunctional family with its head of hormonal steam. Laugh, cry, hold on tight. You will need to. I could almost taste the vodka, as Mia goes through her Mum&apos;s dressing table drawers, bottle in hand. I wish all British films were this good.",

Really no story at all. total time waste for me, there was a few time where I laughed, but it is merely enough. I am really disappointed the way the series is headed. Ice age 1 was the best and so is Ice age 3. Ice age 2 was OK. I laughed many times for the 4th title that is continental drift but Number 5 i.e. collision course was not met my expectation. The movie is worse than other four movies in the series. I lost my valuable one and a half hour behind this. The production makes this movie as they have to make another sequel. No real sympathy moment in the movie as well. But one thing was good about this movie was Simon peg who voiced buck, I liked buck character from previous movies as well. Overall the movie is flop to me.",

      "reviewBody": "As a cinephile from the 21st century, one probably discovers the existence of this film as a fan of the cult classic &quot;Les Visiteurs&quot;, made by Jean-Marie Poiré, with Clavier and Reno and Lemercier as the main core. The prospect of learning about a comedy with that exact cast just two years prior is quite exciting news, even with only average expectations. What happens in this one is that despite being overall fairly impressive looking and well directed, there&apos;s a bit too much going on with the intricacies of the story; which aren&apos;t even that interesting; with too little reward for the viewer at the end. The consumer may be fed a bit of a convoluted story, and accept paying close attention to it, if only it is worth it in the end. But demanding too much focus from the viewer, just to sustain its complicated plight for existence as a crime/comedy doesn&apos;t cut it. There&apos;s a couple of funny scenes, all in typical Poiré fashion and his signature is unmistakable, and there&apos;s a certain personality to the film with its comical characters, but many scenes will come across as long-winded or simply a bit on the hollow side.\n\nThe difference between this and the following &apos;Les Visiteurs&apos; is quite night and day in terms of pace, fullness and relevance in the story, impact in the comedy and overall movie making craft. This is a bit of fun, a few quirky lines in the dialogue as always, and it&apos;s always a bit of a treat to watch these actors during their primes in the early 90&apos;s, but it probably can&apos;t fully justify its 1h45min length.",

Animated in Indonesia with Japanese dialogue and based on Tatsumi&apos;s 800-page memoir &quot;A Drifting Life&quot; and other works, the film was shown in the Un Certain Regard section at this year&apos;s Cannes Film Festival and has been selected as the Singaporean entry for Best Foreign Language film at the Oscars.\n\nIt depicts five different historical periods in Japanese history and dramatizes five stories of post-war Japan: &quot;Hell&quot;, &quot;Beloved Monkey&quot;, &quot;Just a Man&quot;, &quot;Good-Bye&quot; and &quot;Occupied.&quot; These stories with their adult content that includes sex and violence are reported to have drastically altered the medium in Japan.\n\nTatsumi is the narrator of his own biography and explains how he grew up in a dysfunctional environment with six other children. He began to draw as a child and was ten-years-old when the Second World War ended. When he was a teenager, he started to publish his work and describes a meeting with his idol, Osama Tezuka. Unhappy with the genre that restricted manga to children, he began to experiment with darker themes, designed to appeal to adults. Color is used for his bio and one story, while the others use a monochrome hue.\n\n&quot;Hell&quot; is a bizarre story about a photographer covering the aftermath of Hiroshima and discovers two figures burned onto a wall, that of a boy apparently giving his mother a back massage before the bomb hit. He becomes rich from the sale of this picture until a twist undermines the whole idea. In &quot;Beloved Monkey&quot;, a lapse in judgment by a factory worker results in an unwanted result for his pet monkey. An older worker decides to spend all of his savings on women in &quot;Just a Man&apos; but the consequences are not what he intended.\n\n&quot;Good-bye&quot; tells the dark story of a prostitute who is abandoned by an American soldier and takes her anger out on her father. The final story, &quot;Occupied&quot; has a man obsessed with graffiti on the walls of public restroom, a story bordering on the offensive. Apparently, these themes are normal for Japanese manga but to a Western audience their appeal is dubious, although the narration by Tatsumi gives the film a feeling of authenticity. Beyond the questionable material, however, Tatsumi&apos;s stories may be commenting on the decay of Japanese society.",

It&apos;s a thoroughly tongue-in-cheek western, a romp, an antithesis to the grim, nihilistic spaghetti westerns, and reminds me of the TV show Wild Wild West. An exploding watch, an exploding leather bag, an exploding derringer, an exploding Stagecoach, a bandit who takes his throne with him wherever he goes, gold-Stagecoach painted red, male guards dressed as women but they have beards , and beautiful women vying for a cool hero who hardly blinks an eye during the mayhem. Definitely an outrageous romp with Bondian traits. It&apos;s an absolute blast- fun western all the way. It has some good action, too. Rik Van Nutter makes one cool hero and is winking at the audience. Pity there weren&apos;t sequels to this.",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s a certain class of genre flick, seen especially but not exclusively in the 40s or 50s, that ably presents ideas of horror and science fiction but is less able to evoke any strong feelings about the material. Such fare can still be enjoyable on its own merits provided that one is receptive to genre elements that are more thematic than they are actualized. Even with iconic director Freddie Francis on board, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much mistaking that 1962&apos;s &apos;The brain&apos; can be described in such terms. We&apos;re treated to notions of unsanctioned experimentation, consciousness separated from corporeality, metaphysical communication and manipulation, and questions of identity and ethics - in addition to, of course, murder. And all of it is made to be scarcely more compelling than if we were reading the screenplay itself. I do actually like this, but it definitely reflects a more restrained sensibility of film-making that somewhat limits its potential and the size of its audience.\n\nOr maybe we modern viewers are just too cynical and jaded, or so desensitized to ever-increasing intensity and violence that the storytelling older titles have to offer just can&apos;t faze us. After all, there&apos;s a delightful aspect of mystery to the proceedings as protagonist Dr. Corrie undertakes an investigation of sorts into the death of millionaire Holt. All those notions that comprise the genre elements do come to bear at different times, to different degrees. Between the effects and art direction, the admirable acting, some smart scene writing and dialogue, and Kenneth V. Jones&apos; music that accentuates select beats, the creepy edge of the story does lightly shine through, and the greater vibrancy that some moments bear. Why, one way or another some scenes are kind of brilliant, and there is much to appreciate here on its own merits. &apos;The brain&apos; is well made in every regard, including not just those facets I&apos;ve already mentioned but also Francis&apos; direction, Robert Huke&apos;s cinematography, and Oswald Hafenrichter&apos;s editing.\n\nWhile Bernard Lee(!) is the cast member who enjoyed the most broad visibility, Peter van Eyck&apos;s role as protagonist Corrie easily gives him the biggest spotlight, and he takes fine advantage of it to illustrate his skills. That&apos;s hardly to count out the other actors, all of whom capably help to bring the tale to life. There is perhaps a point to be made that the picture mostly carries itself as a fairly straight crime thriller and mystery, with noir tinges, and the titular organ and subsequent story ideas are just flavoring. Moreover, even at under ninety minutes, it starts to feel before it&apos;s all over as if the whole experience has run a little long. Be that as it may the narrative is compelling, with splendid scene writing - and the reveals at the climax, and the ending, are unexpectedly gratifying. No matter how you look at it this is no exemplar by any standard, and it&apos;s nothing one needs to go out of their way to see. Modern viewers who have a harder time engaging with older flicks can probably just pass this right on by. Still, &apos;The brain&apos; is suitably entertaining, and if you do have the chance to watch, it&apos;s not a bad way to spend a quiet afternoon.",

The picture is a sleek production with big budget and genuine chills,suspense,tension,shocks and lots of blood,it&apos;s a terror-thriller very exciting.The film is narrated with intelligent edition,special use of colour and slick utilization of shock images.Movie has a plethora of special effects describing series of weird and otherwordly happenings and a magnificent make-up by the master Rick Baker specially reflected on the hair-raising countenance of dead. However the surprises from original film have disappeared and results to be an inferior sequel.The eerie musical score is by the excellent Hans Zimmer. The motion picture is correctly directed by Hideo Nakata who made the original Japan version. The flick will like to terror cinema fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Some DVDs should come with instructions. In the case of &apos;Lesbian Vampire Killers&apos; such instructions should probably read: Lower IQ sufficiently then insert disc into player, sit back and enjoy. Yes, there is officially no brainpower required to get something out of this movie.\n\nTwo men, played by Mathew Horne and James Corden (no, don&apos;t hate it because Corden&apos;s in it - this was made before he apparently got on everyone&apos;s nerves!), decide to take a random trip to an out-of-the-way little village in England, only to get mixed up in an ancient curse which turns the village&apos;s female population into... well, if you&apos;ve read the title then you can probably guess.\n\nA lot of people pigeonhole this film into the &apos;horror/comedy&apos; genre. But I&apos;d claim it was more an outright &apos;comedy.&apos; Yes, there are vampires involved and, yes, they bite people but that&apos;s about as &apos;horrific&apos; as it goes. There&apos;s very little in the way of gore and even less moments that will actually scare you (oh, and if you&apos;re tempted to watched based on the &apos;lesbian&apos; aspect - there&apos;s only really hot women/vampires kissing - you can probably find more than that online!). However, it&apos;s the banter between the two main leads that really makes this film worth a watch.\n\nThey&apos;ve starred together before in the British TV sitcom &apos;Gavin and Stacey&apos; (which I haven&apos;t seen), but I&apos;m told these two new characters are different enough from their previous creations to set them apart. Plus already working together improves the chemistry between them.\n\nUltimately, &apos;Lesbian Vampire Killers&apos; is a spoof of the &apos;vampire genre&apos; and takes great delight in sending up all the cliches that have been around from &apos;Buffy&apos; through to &apos;True Blood.&apos; Paul McGann comes into the film about three quarters of the way through and it&apos;s always fun seeing a more &apos;well respected&apos; actor sending himself up as the local priest. The women are just, er, there, so if you&apos;re hoping for any groundbreaking female leads then you&apos;re probably looking in the wrong place.\n\n&apos;Lesbian Vampire Killers&apos; is just good daft fun. If you have low expectations, plus don&apos;t mind foul language and want to see the vampire genre ripped on, then give his a go. Oh, and when I say &apos;foul&apos; language, I should probably say there&apos;s also plenty of &apos;politically incorrect&apos; language too. So, if you&apos;re offended by that, walk on.",

It has its share of funny moments but much of the comedy seems forced to the screenplay and lack the charm of its prequel &apos;Jui kuen&apos;. The plot is very predictable and clichèd. The set designs, particularly Wong&apos;s house have been nicely decorated. The background score is pleasant. Jackie Chan pretty much plays the same character as in most of his films but he&apos;s still fun to watch. Anita Mui deserves special mention as she provides the funniest moments and is a delight to watch (even though it felt slightly awkward to see her cast as Chan&apos;s mother). So for me what stood out in this film are the brave action sequences (particularly the one at the end) and Anita Mui. Otherwise it&apos;s quite an average film as I did not feel as entertained as I would expect when watching a Jackie Chan film."

      "reviewBody": "The opening scenes of Little Women are so beautifully captured on film that it looks almost like a Currier and Ives post card. It is so magically evocative of a New England in the early 1860&apos;s that the viewer is transported to that time visually and emotionally. The characters are so well crafted, warm and human that you truly wish you knew them. The way the movie glides through the season&apos;s, from the deep snows of winter, to the bright flowers of spring, through the summer into the golden hues of autumn each season is so wonderfully captured that viewers one hundred years from now will feel that they time tripped to that age so long ago. With the brutal civil war as the backdrop to the play, the movie tells the sensitive and gentle story of four young sister&apos;s on the homefront. Each sister is defined and likeable. Brought to life brilliently by June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor and Margaret O&apos;Brien. Each actress captured fully the innocents, decency and depth of their roles, imprinting forever the definitive characterizations that would have made Louisa May Alcott proud. I love this most beautiful work of cinematic art so much that I never tire of watching it. It is a treat for the eyes, the heart and the soul and at the end when the camera pans back to view the sky festooned with a glorious rainbow your emotions leap for joy that a movie can so utterly express the simple elegance of human decency and goodness."

The trio proceed to plot an elaborate heist.\n\nThe movie has its critics, particularly those who think it is too slow. And, indeed, even when cut down to 99 minutes and dubbed in English, critic Vincent Canby still found it to be a tad slow. Most of the film has no music, which keeps the pace slower, and there is the notorious heist scene featuring no dialogue for thirty minutes. For some, that may be intolerable.\n\nMelville is a master, and possibly the most underrated director of his era. His name means nothing to so many people, and yet he never made a bad film. Even when relying on cliché (such as crossing a river to avoid detection), he does it with finesse.",

      "reviewBody": "Directed by Andrea Bianchi, the man who also gave us the hilariously trashy Italian zombie classic Burial Ground and the magnificently sleazy giallo Strip Nude for Your Killer, Malabimba is a fairly humdrum tale of possession, clearly inspired by The Exorcist but given a massive shot in the arm by the presence of some serious Euro-babeage and the inclusion of several very steamy scenes, some of which even enter XXX territory thanks to the use of hardcore insert shots.\n\nStar of the film is the rather lovely Katell Laennec who plays sixteen year old Bimba Karoli, whose over-protective father Andrea keeps her away from the rest of the world in the family castle, which is also home to several other relatives. During a séance, intended to allow Andrea to contact his dead wife Daniela, Bimba becomes possessed by the spirit of evil ancestor Lucrezia and is transformed into a sexual deviant. Apprentice nun Sister Sofia (Mariangela Giordano) realises the truth, but can she save Bimba without falling victim to Lucrezia&apos;s seductive power herself?\n\nLots of shots of luscious Laennec in the altogether indulging in all manner of perversion; Giordano whipping off her wimple and habit to get saucy; and busty blonde Patrizia Webley (as Bimba&apos;s nympho aunt Nais) making a couple of the men in the castle very happy chappies indeed: despite the rather mediocre plot, Bianchi&apos;s film has more than enough quality sleaze to ensure a good time, with the added explicit footage only making matters even more seedy.\n\nIn the film&apos;s predictable finale (if you&apos;ve seen The Exorcist, that is), Sofia sacrifices herself by becoming the vessel for Lucrezia&apos;s corruptive spirit and promptly dives head-first off the castle&apos;s ramparts before she is able to succumb to sin. What a waste of a randy nun!\n\nInterestingly, a virtual remake of Malabimba-entitled La Bimba di Satana (Satan&apos;s Baby Doll)- was directed the following year by Mario Bianchi (no relation of Andrea, as far as I can find out); the uncut version of that film also featured several equally explicit sex scenes but the torturously slow pacing and shoddy direction made it a far less entertaining affair than it&apos;s predecessor.",

      "reviewBody": "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana&apos;s death, Helen Mirren doesn&apos;t forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that&apos;s always being in front of our eyes but we&apos;ve never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it&apos;s Helen Mirren&apos;s film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Attack on the Pin-Up Boys&quot; is a movie with close to zero plot, below average performances and not very intelligent humor. Nonetheless, the movie is saved from being a total failure by its easy charm.\n\nThe story is thin as they come: the pretty boys of the high schools of the city are being attacked by a mysterious person, who is throwing bags of smelly things to them. Curiously, the attacks only make a celebrity of them, and the 3 pretty boys of the next school in the list will try to be the one to be attacked.\n\nThe story is not much to write about, but it could have been a smart and/or funny commentary on idol culture, and poke fun at all that goes around it. But the movie falls flat, the jokes range from lame to childish, and the actors (which are part of a popular Korean group) struggle to do much with what they have to work with. Nonetheless they have an easy charm and make for fun company, which gives some much needed life to the proceedings.\n\nAll in all, the movie is basically emptiness, and has not much to recommend it for.",

Personally, nothing was going right for this film, but it turned out to be one hell of a movie.\n\nThe theme for this movie is &quot;Dream&quot;, and it is cheesy as it sounds, as expected of a anime-based movie. However, the movie had the energy and its fast pace in addition to the interesting setting quickly drew me into the story. It is apparent a lot of effort was put into the SFX and production of this movie.\n\nMatsuyuki Yasuko seemed totally out of place in a bad role, but she was absolutely hot. There were many stupid moments, but I found myself constantly laughing, even at dirty jokes. This film has the magic, there is no other way of explaining it. Other than its excessively cheesy &quot;showdown&quot; scene at the end, this movie was perfect in every way. Good enough to satisfy even the harshest doubters (i.e. me). Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "With the success that Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson had in That Midnight Kiss, MGM knew it had a box office team of appeal. The following year the two of them moved from contemporary Philadelphia to pre-World War I, New Orleans.\n\nPeople paid their money to hear Mario sing and really didn&apos;t care about the plots of his films. Lanza was cast as an opera singing truck driver in That Midnight Kiss, as an opera singer drafted into the army in Because You&apos;re Mine, and the greatest opera singer of all in The Great Caruso. I think we can see a pattern forming here.\n\nIn The Toast of New Orleans Lanza plays a shrimp fisherman who works on the boat with his uncle J. Carrol Naish. When opera singer Kathryn Grayson comes to town, Lanza boisterously and impulsively joins her in a duet of Be My Love. Her manager and New Orleans opera kingpin, David Niven is as impressed as everyone else was in 1950 with Mario&apos;s voice. He&apos;s even willing to overlook to some extent the fact he&apos;s moving in on Grayson.\n\nActing wise The Toast of New Orleans is no strain on anybody. Mario and Kathryn play a pair of singers and Mario as in all of his films, just played himself. It&apos;s interesting that the only times he attempted to play a role from classic operetta, The Student Prince and The Vagabond King it didn&apos;t work out for him. \n\nAs for David Niven, he&apos;s as debonair and charming as he always was. Niven carried more films on the strength of his charm than any other star in the sound era.\n\nBut no one worried about acting and a plot in this film. Like That Midnight Kiss, The Toast of New Orleans has a nice mixture of classical opera and some good songs by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn to round out a very full score. One of the songs, Be My Love, became Mario Lanza&apos;s signature song, his biggest selling record on RCA Victor Red Seal label. You could not go ANYWHERE in 1950 without hearing Be My Love coming out of some radio. Be My Love was nominated for Best Song in 1950, but lost to Mona Lisa.\n\nNorman Taurog directed Mario in this film, he had previously won an Oscar for Skippy and had directed Spencer Tracy to his second Academy Award in Boy&apos;s Town. Taurog was an interesting choice for a director to pilot a picture with a personality like Lanza. Later on Taurog would end his career directing nine of Elvis Presley&apos;s feature films, another instance of him directing a mega-pop personality successfully.\n\nThe Toast of New Orleans is for Mario Lanza fans everywhere and this review is dedicated to my father who was a big fan.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching &quot;Space Mutiny&quot; is the metaphorical equivalent of drinking cat urine...there&apos;s no way it can be any good for you, so why even try?\n\nThe special effects in this film are, I&apos;m not kidding now, stock footage from Battlestar Galactica (played backwards, in some cases), or shot on what appears to be low-resolution video using models probably built from discarded &quot;He-Man&quot; toys.  Unfortunately, that&apos;s about the best thing in the movie.\n\nThe acting...my God, the acting...I have NO idea who came up with this dialogue.  Reb Brown is ridiculous, John Philip Law is absolutely NOT to be believed, and the rest of the cast, as well as the costumes, look like outtakes from an episode of Buck Rogers!  (The second season...the really STINKY one!)  The whole damned thing looks vaguely like a fever dream I had as a child after drinking sixteen cans of &quot;Jolt&quot;...and it&apos;s equally incomprehensible.  My God, they actually announce the arrival of a pirate fleet by having some dope on a microphone say, &quot;This is the pirate fleet...surrender or be turned into astro-dust.&quot;  I think they shot the whole thing in a brewery with Go-Karts and used the same shot of a hops bin blowing up no less than four times. This movie has to be seen to be believed.  I actually bought a copy for three dollars, just so I could show my friends that I was NOT making it up. Run, don&apos;t walk, away from this film.\n\n0.0 stars out of a possible five.",

      "reviewBody": "La banda dei babbi Natale is a comic film it is true, but it contains various morals within it, the acting of the three leads is excellent, but never as good as that of Angela Finocchiaro, here playing the role of a policewoman. The film follows the story of these three &apos;santas&apos; through numerous flashbacks or &apos;premises&apos;. Between comedy and morals, the film flows pleasantly, increasing the desire to know what really happened and to find out how it will end. Unrealistic story? Unlikely ending? It matters little, as this film does not focus on normal film standards, but tries to get its messages across in another, simpler way. It should in fact be seen as a fairy tale, not a film. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 as far as the technical part of the film is concerned. In fact, normally in a film by actors like Laurel and Hardy or Aldo, Giovanni e Giacomo, the director disappears, whereas in this case, thanks to the direction, the film flows smoothly and perfectly, without any kind of error.",

If it was as contagious as it sounds then it would have run rampant during the middle ages onwards. (The most likely way to catch it would have been close and dare I say, irresponsible contact with a victim) This would have been better if it was made as a feature film as it would be more appropriate and responsible, besides, its out of date now isn&apos;t it? However, it was not without it&apos;s upsides as the drama was well portrayed, well documented and well thought up (despite it&apos;s plot holes and controversies)."

      "reviewBody": "In case you close your eyes every time Hollywood is mentioned, you might not know that Jennifer Lawrence was in The (hugely profitable) Hunger Games. She&apos;s currently Tinseltown&apos;s darling and, judging by this film, can sell anything.\n\nThe House at the End of the Street is about a teenage girl and her mother, who move into a house next to one where some murders were committed a while back. The teenage boy who witnessed said killings still lives there. Let the creepiness commence.\n\nThere is nothing &apos;supernatural&apos; about this film, it&apos;s a sort of horror/thriller with teenage leads. And that&apos;s the most important part. Whereas Twilight was a vampire story for teens and The Hunger Games was a Battle Royale/Running Man for teens. The House at the End of the Street is a horror/thriller for teens. I&apos;m sure plenty of 15+ people will enjoy it too, but I&apos;m going to stick my neck out and guess that its primary fanbase will be around the 15 years of age mark.\n\nI&apos;ve seen a lot of these times of horror/thrillers. Perhaps that&apos;s my problem. I know every scare and twist going (and can therefore predict them a mile off). However, if I hadn&apos;t watched many of these sorts of films, I&apos;m sure I would enjoy it much, much more. Basically, to seasoned and cynical cinema-goers such as myself, this film offers nothing new. It conforms to every cliché going, yet it was pretty damn successful, proving that Jennifer Lawrence is one hell of a box office draw. Fair play to it for finding an audience - I just don&apos;t think many people will get much out of this is (a) they have seen plenty of these type of films before and (b) if they&apos;re not in the &apos;Twilight generation.&apos; Oh, and don&apos;t get me started on the actual NAME of the film. Even fans of the film must admit that whatever Hollywood writer picked it was having a really slack and lazy day. Seriously...",

As for the actors/actresses, they do an OK job with what they&apos;ve been handed. This is definitely intended for the slasher crowd at the theater, as it really doesn&apos;t come across as well on the small screen.\n\nHauer&apos;s role is really no more than an extended cameo. The other actors are interchangeable. After a decent beginning, you&apos;ll get a lot of blood, some nudity, and some really anti-social behavior between friends/class-mates.\n\nAgain, much better than a lot of the independent junk that&apos;s out there. It doesn&apos;t hurt to watch it.",

Rachel encounters Henry Ian Cusick, (Brian),&quot;The Gospel of John&quot;,&apos;03 who seems to know a great deal about the Light House and its history and has some fun burying a Mother-0f Pearl sea shell in the sand as a symbol of lasting love. There are many twists and turns in this film and it is very well produced and directed. I must say, I have never seen Demi Moore looking so young and very sexy. Great entertaining film, enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 1980s, college student Samantha Hughes (Jocelin Donahue) takes a strange babysitting job that coincides with a full lunar eclipse. She slowly realizes her clients harbor a terrifying secret.\n\nI absolutely love that director Ti West did everything he could to make this come off as a 1980s movie -- the style, the 16mm camera, releasing the film in a clam shell box (I am surprised they actually allowed this last one). Opinions vary, but I think it is safe to say the (modern) golden age for horror was the 1980s. And here we are, adding another 80s film to the list (sort of).\n\nWest also managed to hire genre actors Tom Noonan, Dee Wallace and Mary Woronov for the picture, which I think fans appreciate. Larry Fessenden served as a producer, and this may be the best project Fessenden was ever attached to.\n\nWhat I find as strange is how this film is very highly rated by people. Not that it is a bad film. I enjoyed it. But I think it is interesting that the film gets a lot of credit for working in the 1980s style. Had this identical film come out in the 1980s, it may have hardly registered among its peers. This film rides the wave of nostalgia... and it rides it well.",

      "reviewBody": "This film make us deeply thinking. Thinking about accepting or not accepting that being beautiful is a solid reason to be vulnerable. In fact, one-sided opposition to a society where the majority of its mankind suffers from the complexities of one-sidedness of traditionalism requires a strong soul. The key question is whether the movie wants to believe or accept us. Accepting the belief that such a world is outside the angle of view of the pretty girl of the city is very hellish and horrible. What ever before and after the incident. Of course, this is evident after the incident, but before that, the question is whether it is a pleasure to be seen with this volume. Believe which direction to look at, in what direction, can it be appealing in the face of its apparent connotations that mark us? Whether the subject matter in the cinema may have a fruitful effect is directly related to the capacity, culture, and the type of exposure to the geographic mass of that country. But as a foreigner, the viewer of this film, considering that it does not sad us, must be seen and think about how close this attitude is to us. The slightest thing that can be seen for how the film is influenced by the national dimension of both the constructive and the global dimension is the bitter laugh that we may face from our unconscious acceptance of the approval of this issue, and the adoption of this rule, which at least With certainty it can not be totally rejected. The degree of sensitivity to acceptance and rejection of the audience is a moral medal that we all humans deny and give ourselves to. The film is artistically pointing out the psychological effects of a very shaky and unpredictable (rape) attack, so that we believe that all of us collapse in the failure of such a futile structure and cease. The film, of course, contains inscrutable points, so far as we do not know exactly how love can affect this level of logic as well, one who desperately wants to die. Its extraordinary sequences include the latest sequences. We do not have mercy to each other death.",

Ciniematography is average. The thematic line is simple and is composed of lighter vein episodes. Nag and other actors make a good team with varied characteristics. The scenes featuring them are well written and equally well handled. However the misunderstanding part between hero and heroine is not quite convincing. It is that message of winning love with Rajani&apos;s beauty and acting, which fills the film. Well scored music and background score worth observing just to know how it helped in building up drama and romance. Over all good performance and no wonder collected millions of rupees.",

It&apos;s so gratifying to know that you can find little gems like this among all the crap that gets feed to us in the theaters (Yeah, I&apos;m talking to you &apos;Oz the Great and Powerful&apos; and &apos;Jack the Giant Slayer&apos; and every Jason Statham movie made since &apos;The Italian Job&apos;). &quot;Baytown&quot; is about three brothers who only know violence and mayhem. They live their life one mark at a time and always looking for the one last big score. They find it in smoking hot Eva Longoria. She commissions them to get back her god son from the evil clutches of drug lord Carlos (Billy Bob Thornton). Thornton plays the same character he&apos;s played over the past couple of years (&apos;Bad Santa&apos;, &apos;Bad News Bears&apos;), and I still love it. This movie is a cool blend of other films like &apos;The Warriors&apos;, &apos;The Way of the Gun&apos;, and &apos;Smokin&apos; Aces&apos;. Its definitely worth a watch and should also restore your faith in the Direct-to-DVD bin. 7.5 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Mary O&apos;Hara&apos;s novel &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot; is the basis for this wonderful family oriented movie. Directed by Michael Mayer, a man whose work we had admired before, offers a positive view of a Wyoming family that is struggling to make a living out the ranch where they raise horses and the changes that are happening around them.\n\nAt the center of the story is Katy McLaughlin, a young woman who is happier being in the family ranch than at the boarding school, where she seems to be out of place. When Katy goes back home after not completing a key exam, she begins to feel like a human being. All the great outdoors are at her finger tips. The horses she loves are also part of her life.\n\nA fearless rider, Katy is surprised one day by a mountain lion who comes near her. A mustang that appears out of nowhere comes to her rescue, attracting Katy&apos;s attention. A bond will develop between the young woman and the horse that will prove it to be a mutual love and respect they feel about one another. She names the horse Flicka and becomes her champion when her father feels a mustang doesn&apos;t belong in the ranch because what it will do to the other pure bred horses. In the end, the father, as well as the family realize how deep Katy cares for Flicka and the way the horse responds to her.\n\nAlison Lohman, who is seen as Flicka, is an actress that seems a natural no matter what role she is asked to play. Tim McGraw does justice to the father, and lovely Maria Bello is perfect as the mother.\n\nThe beautiful cinematography by J. Michael Muro does wonders to create the right atmosphere in which the action is presented. The same can be said for the musical score of Aaron Zigman, which is tuneful and fits well in the picture. There is no doubt Michael Mayer will continue to surprise us in his future projects.\n\nHighly recommended for all families.",

I&apos;m not usually a huge Hi-Def snob, but I highly recommend you watch the film on good TV. \n\nAs for the first couple of reviews, I say they are bogus. These guys give so much back.

      "reviewBody": "When I saw the billings for this, I admit that it piqued my interest. Who&apos;d ever have pitched the epitome of style that is James Mason into a western with Lee Van Cleef? Well, Gene Martin did - and he made a mess of the whole thing. Mason actually features quite sparingly as &quot;Montero&quot;, the gent who has pinched &quot;Alicia&quot; (Gina Lollobrigida) from her train-robbing husband &quot;King&quot; (Lee Van Cleef). Not only did she abandon him, but she managed to get him sectioned at the same time for being mad, and she absconded with all his loot. Anyway, he escapes and they rendezvous some years later on a river boat where she outlines a cunning plan to rob the Mexican government of $1m in gold. Philip Yordan wrote the screenplay, but perhaps he was only engaged for a few days because what we have is really a poorly scripted, stylised, collection of almost slapstick &quot;comedy&quot; scenes as they firstly destroy an arsenal and set about obtaining their treasure. Lollobrigida is the star here, she has her tongue firmly in her cheek and really does rescue this from the comedic doldrums to which it is heading. There are a few other fun scenes - turning an old Model T-type car into an armoured car by nailing planks of wood to, for instance; and they are undoubtedly aided by the Mexican troops who couldn&apos;t hit a barn door with a Howitzer at ten paces. It&apos;s colourful and it doesn&apos;t hang about - and the ending is little bit apt, but the film itself is all over the shop and struggles to engage above the puerile.",

      "reviewBody": "well, despite some scathing reviews on here, i loved it.  it&apos;s got some glorious tension building, and although the ending is scrappy, the exploration of morality between the two characters, and what their lives are built on gives a lot of energy to that tension, and to the ending.  some bits could have been handled better, but the portrayal of Henriksen as the &quot;loser&quot; character (was that paunch fake anyone know?) is wonderful, a real Homer.  right up til the end.\n\nwatching it for the second time to re-evaluate the relationship between the two bears up too, now you know what they and you know.\n\nwatch it, it&apos;s worth it.  Henriksen at a high point."

      "reviewBody": "First off, this is a much better movie if you have seen Murnau&apos;s expressionist masterpiece, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. There are a number of scenes from this movie that draw on &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, and it makes a lot of the scenes more enjoyable. The movie is done in very much an expressionist vein it itself, the kind of film F.W. Murnau would certainly have appreciated.\n\nThe concept here is incredibly intriguing - what if a horror movie was a horror to film? Once the film kicks into gear, it establishes a rather creepy mood, especially in the sets, most of which mirror those of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (the writer&apos;s bed, for instance, looks exactly like Hutter&apos;s).\n\nAs the film progresses, the actors take over the film, and it&apos;s interesting to see how they stack up to their precursors from 70 years ago. Eddie Izzard is an interesting Hutter (the Jonathan Harker analog), as (pretend) silent acting is well-tailored to his overbearing antics. Udo Kier is quite good as reserved producer Albin Grau. Alas, Cary Elwes, one of Hollywood&apos;s most underappreciated actors, is typecast as a kind of roguish, free-spirited Fritz Wagner, a real cinematographer (and the main one throughout all of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;) and one of the stalwarts of German cinema into the 50&apos;s.\n\nMalkovich is ideal for this role. He does a good job of being a manic, desparate for everything on his film to go right. His Murnau is a control-freak, a guy who keeps his crew in the dark, and adds to the generally creepiness.\n\nThe most curious thing about Murnau&apos;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is the vampire himself. The rest of the characters are pretty direct analogs of &quot;Dracula&quot;. But instead of a suave, cool vampire of the Christopher Lee/Gary Oldman mold (later roles, of course), Murnau&apos;s vampire was a stiff, cold, violent monster. Willem Dafoe is absolutely brilliant in portraying this. He has some moments of comedic relief, bickering harmlessly with Malkovich, and generally being a fish out of water. Soon, however, his character becomes undeniably creepy, and Dafoe does a great job of making Count Orlok seem like the kind of guy who makes your skin crawl. In some way, this Orlok is less of a monster - he&apos;s portrayed a bit more sympathetically, sorrowing in his loneliness and never getting to see light. Murnau&apos;s vampire was almost always shot from below, making him appear huge and menacing; Dafoe&apos;s Orlok isn&apos;t monstrous so much as he just makes your skin crawl.\n\nI do have a couple beefs, though, mainly technical. On a purely nitpicky level, Murnau is mentioned as a comtemporary of Griffith and Eisenstein, despite the fact that Eisenstein didn&apos;t make a movie until two years after &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. On a less petty level, the characters seem a bit dumb. They have no problem accepting the fact that Orlok is an actual vampire once Malkovich tells them, but can&apos;t seem to figure it out on their own, despite seeing, among other things, Orlok pulling a bat out of the air and sucking the blood out of it.\n\nThe film, in general, does not end well. The penultimate scene is horribly contrived, a lot of silly reminiscing to to advance the plot a little. The ending itself isn&apos;t necessarily bad, just a bit ambigous. You don&apos;t come away with a clear sense of who (if anyone) was wronged amongst the main characters, and we leave a couple of them in limbo. A couple of technical details are odd, too. Murnau&apos;s Nosferatu has a shadow and a reflection, but this one only a shadow. Also, in the final scene they are supposedly filming, there&apos;s a wooden stake that&apos;s nowhere to be found in &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.\n\nA quick note, by the way - while the movie they are filming actually exists, rest assured the story is pure fantasy. Max Schreck went on to make more movies, as did the rest of the actors in this film, and no actors were bitten during the filming of the original movie.\n\nA thououghly enjoyable film, especially if you&apos;re familiar with the subject matter.",

The gangster comedy which is a unique genre in Korean cinema is always hovering and resurrecting whenever audiences are tired and bored of copy-catted old flicks.\n\nThis movie, at one glance, is outrageous and hilarious but lacks the breakthrough for the evolution of stalled genre. Too many visual gags and cinematographic jokes spoil the consistency of characters. Besides, no universal laugh is expected but only small portion of human kind will take this as a Comedy: unnecessary assortment of awkward situations and unrealistic background of Korean gangster family and law enforcement.\n\nSome native Korean movie-goers will not feel sorry for paying tickets but there hardly is a theater-sitter who is willing to be amused by watching the surrealistic relationship between a gangster boss and a female prosecutor. Time has passed in Korea when the gangster used to collect the protection fee from naive movie-goers!! Now it&apos;s time they were only remembered as one of past favorite cinema characters. No more gangsters in Korean movie, please!",

But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don&apos;t hear complaints about them. I don&apos;t know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. \n\nIt&apos;s got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it&apos;s exciting, it&apos;s got decent acting and effects.

Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.\n\nYou won&apos;t have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn&apos;t. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. If you haven&apos;t read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. And if you have read the book, well lets say you might be a little let down because I found many scenes missing that I was looking forward to.\n\nOverall, Pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer. But, maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Mexican luchador (wrestler) movies are a very odd genre. Imagine...they feature one or more masked wrestlers battling the likes of aliens, Atlantians, monsters (including Frankenstein, Dracula, mummies, the Wolfman, witches and zombies) and megalomaniacs bent on world domination. In some ways, the films are like James Bond or superhero films...but far, far cheesier when it comes to plot, make-up and the extensive use of cheap rubber masks.\n\nIn &quot;Hellish Spiders&quot; (&quot;Arañas Infernales&quot;), Blue Demon battles aliens from planet Arácnea, who have come to Earth to bring back brains for their queen to consume. Apparently, she ate up all the brains from her own planet and nearby planets and that&apos;s why they&apos;ve chosen ours. Can Blue Demon stop them or is he destined to be brainless like everyone else on Earth?\n\nThe film might have been better titled &quot;Plan 9 from Arácnea&quot;, as the special effects are that bad....yes, Ed Wood Jr. bad. The UFOs look like pie plates and jiggle just like them. And, like &quot;Plan 9&quot; they also can shoot out beams to turn folks into skeletons! And, like &quot;Plan 9&quot; the writing and acting and direction are pretty bad...and also unintentionally funny. I checked and was not surprised to see that some of the film WAS lifted from &quot;Plan 9&quot; as well as another crap-tastic American film from the same era, &quot;Teenagers From Outer Space&quot;. You know a film is bad when it steals from this caliber of movie!!\n\nOverall, this is a terrible film. But like &quot;Plan 9&quot; there is a certain campy silliness that make it fun viewing. Terrible in just about every way...yet funny because it&apos;s so incredibly bad!",

      "reviewBody": "I have always eschewed dubbed movies. This may be the first one I&apos;ve ever seen. The dubbed dialog includes a lot of forced sounding laughter and is highly reminiscent of inaccurate subtitles. Probably when the Unites States exports action movies that make hundreds of millions of dollars abroad, the dubbing is slicker.\n\nThe plot involves a young man token out of prison to assist a well known journalist. The young man is played by Horst Buchholz, surely one of the handsomest men ever to work in major movies. The journalist and his young female ward are unknown to me and it&apos;s difficulty to comment on their acting under these circumstances.\n\nI have the feeling, which could be wrong, that the Buchholz character is meant to be a little like the Terrence Stamp character in Pasolini&apos;s &quot;Teorema&quot; -- that he is attractive to all who encounter him.\n\nIn any case, it&apos;s interesting to me that this movie was released a few years before &quot;One, Two, Three.&quot; That is probably the movie for which most Americans know Buchholz. The plot is similar to that of Wilder&apos;s earlier &quot;Ace in the Hole,&quot; in that it involves cynical, exploitative journalists.\n\nI am not a fan of One, Two, Three,&quot; though I like almost everything else Wilder did in this country enormously. This project, with the same young male lead, might have been a more interesting undertaking for the man who made not only &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; but also &quot;A Foreign Affair.&quot;",

The House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Hollywood for communist influences and the result was the infamous &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;. The Hollywood Ten were communist sympathizers--some were former sympathizers, others still believed in the cause. They were correctly blacklisted for years. These were not innocent men who were being crucified for mere political beliefs. Communism is antithetical to the American way of life. So these Hollywood Ten slimeballs believed in an idea to subvert the American way of life, then tried to hide behind the Constitution. That sounds pretty hypocritical to me. They were not and never will be heroes, despite how Hollywood tries to make them out to be saintly victims.",

      "reviewBody": "Before I begin my review of this film, I&apos;d like to point out some interesting tidbits about the film. Firstly, the cool monster shown on the box art is from the film &quot;Breeders&quot;. Secondly, this creature doesn&apos;t even appear in film. Third, according to IMDb this film is a sequel to &quot;Unseen Evil&quot;, which I have not seen (though based on what I saw here I&apos;m not sure I want to anyways), but I rented this under the title &quot;Alien 3000&quot;, a title which has no relevance to the film. \n\nAnyways, this masterpiece has a bunch of foul-mouthed and stupid &quot;soldiers&quot; from the &quot;Paranormal government research agency&quot; (good to see our tax dollars hard at work) going into a remote mountain range to look for missing soldiers. What they find instead is a blood-thirsty creature capable of turning invisible (I didn&apos;t sense any &quot;Predator&quot; vibes while watching this one, no sir!), which begins killing them off one by one. If you&apos;re looking for a B movie with cringe-inducing dialog, horrid production values and deliciously awful special effects, you&apos;ve rentedor, Lord have mercy on you&apos;re soul, boughtthe right movie. Everything about the film is cheap and laughable. The special effects, as one would imagine, are the funniest aspect of this film. The alien creature is brought to life by a combination of hideously bad CGI and a slightly less awful man-in-a-suit, either way it looks stupid and cheesy. The miniatures are among the worst in motion picture history. The toy helicopter, the remote controlled Ford F-150 pick-up (substituting for a Jeep pick-up in non-effects scenes--I love how the makers even left in real-sized shrubbery just to make it look worse), and the explosion of the &quot;Paranormal research&quot; headquarters were all so pitiful that I was laughing until tears blurred my vision. The gore effects were unimpressive but abundant, and as another viewer mentioned, the splitting-in-two of a character&apos;s head was especially bad. \n\nI&apos;ll give the film credit where credit is duethe lead actress, Megan Molloy, Was very good, and deserves better roles than this. Everything else is bad--but entertainingly so. Highly recommended for fans of crappy movies.\n\n1/10.",

I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not &apos;a timeless classic&apos; as it is often called.\n\nThe ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending.\n\nThe characters in this film are what let&apos;s this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are &apos;ok&apos; but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending.\n\nHitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard.\n\nThough well-made it is not &apos;perfect&apos; and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.",

Nobody believes Andy&apos;s story about Chucky the killer doll, but that soon changes when the doll returns, possessed once again by serial killer Charles Lee Ray. It goes on another rampage, this time trying to free his evil soul from the doll and transfer into Andy&apos;s body.\n\nThe plot&apos;s pacing, script, and music score work fine in this movie, with a some good humor and suspense, and some creepy moments. The acting was pretty good for the most part - especially enjoyed the characters of Andy and Kyle. Vincent portrayed Andy with innocence but determination and Christine Elise gave a rebellious yet tender-hearted and strong portrayal of foster teenager Kyle. Brad Dourif gave another sinister, dark, and sarcastically funny portrayal of Chucky.\n\nThe overall horror elements may seem tame by more recent standards, but it&apos;s still a rather entertaining horror sequel.\n\nGrade B",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite, and making it into a satisfying, worthwhile movie. In &quot;Mr. Smith Goes To Washington&quot;, they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold. It&apos;s not quite on the level of &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, but it is as good as almost anything else of its kind.\n\nStewart&apos;s performance is important right from the beginning - hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure. Even his wide-eyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably. As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further, Stewart is even better.\n\nThe secondary characters are also important, because the story itself is a rather stylized, though still worthwhile, statement about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart&apos;s troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well. Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship, keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation."

Obviously, at just two-minutes there&apos;s nothing ground-breaking here but fans of Guy and early cinema should be entertained by this. The actual dance being performed is pretty good on its own plus it&apos;s always interesting watching these old films and being able to watch popular acts. The other thing of note here is the hand tinted coloring, which looks very good, although the color in Guy&apos;s later films certainly got better (just check out some of the ones from 1905). The blue-ish tint on the dress is certainly the most eye-catching."

At first, all goes amazingly well, and the two get along great. Of course, this wouldn&apos;t be much of a thriller if everything went peachy. So, it&apos;s not long before Sam starts wooing Allison back, and Hedy starts exhibiting some odd quirks and rather unsettling behaviors. Things only get worse from here. What&apos;s a woman-gone-berserk to do next? Why, kill everyone in her way, naturally!\n\nSWF came out at a time when similar psychological thrillers were all the rage. Ms.&apos; Fonda and Jason-Leigh are quite good in their roles, with Allison going from clueless to suspicious to fighting for survival, while Hedy goes from seemingly shy to completely bananas! Those who love this sort of movie will love this one. Those who don&apos;t, can blame FATAL ATTRACTION.\n\nP.S.- Anyone enamored with the female form will be overjoyed to know that both Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason-Leigh spend relatively lengthy periods of time in their birthday suits!..."

      "reviewBody": "A young child wanders off into the woods and is lost. With the dangerous, bloodthirsty tiger Shere Khan lurking about, the little boy is adopted by wolves and raised in the jungle. Later embroiled in a jungle feud with Shere Khan, the partly grown boy is driven out of the jungle back into the world of man where he seeks a tooth (a knife) with which he can once and for all strike down his arch nemesis. However the world of man offers many unseen dangers and man isn&apos;t inclined to follow those laws of the jungle to which the animals abide.\n\nPersonally I feel this is the best adaptation of the &quot;Jungle Book&quot; Rudyard Kipling story put to film. I prefer this over the Disney versions because it never fully loses sight of its overall message, doesn&apos;t fail to show the key differences between man and beast, and isn&apos;t bogged down by comedy or musical distraction. It&apos;s also fun and adventurous, boasts real animals in the familiar roles who give surprisingly believable performances. Lead Sabu as Mowgli is a natural to the role while character actor Joseph Calleia does quite well as lead villain Buldeo. Calleia made quite a career out of playing such roles. By far the silliest moments here have got to be the result of the talking snakes with the human voices. They are the only critters in the film to talk in such a fashion. While the information they relay is vital to the plot of the movie, I&apos;m not sure we really needed to actually hear it spoken aloud. Also the romantic subplot doesn&apos;t quite fit in the story either and that it&apos;s introduced and never resolved is somewhat disappointing. Still at the end of the day, you want jungle adventure excitement done right, you won&apos;t go wrong with 1942&apos;s Jungle Book.",

      "name": "Sunshine - rather good..",
      "reviewBody": "Sunshine cost £20 million. Jerry Bruckheimer and his Hollywood cohorts must be shaking their heads in disbelief. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland, British born and bred, have outdone America&apos;s effects laden finest, and at a mere fraction of the price. Armageddon ($140 million) and Pirates of The Caribbean 2 ($225 million) have nothing, nothing on the majestic visuals that Sunshine offers. From the jaw dropping opening sequence to the fantastically realised final moments, Boyle&apos;s latest is a mighty treat for the eyes. \n\nBut of course, effects do not make a film. You need only consider the two aforementioned Bruckheimer blowouts for proof. But happily, behind the blinding visuals, Sunshine has a violently beating heart. One that offers absolutely no let up, that gains speed and then gains a little more, before finally threatening cardiac arrest. You can&apos;t help but live and breath every moment of the crew&apos;s breathless existence. \n\nThe year is 2057 and a select group of astronauts are given that most trifling of tasks. The sun is dying. Drop a bomb in it. Save all of mankind. And to top it all, on a ship rather ominously named &apos;Icarus II&apos;. Add inevitable inter crewmember tension and you have a rather heated situation. The sweaty crew are played wonderfully by a decidedly un-starry, but talented cast. Cilian Murphy, taking the lead role as the ship&apos;s resident physicist Cappa, the only member who has the wherewithal to actually drop the bomb, is coolly enigmatic as ever, the blue orbs of his eyes forming a nice counterpoint to the never far rather redder orb of the sun. You can&apos;t help but feel he isn&apos;t particularly challenged as an actor, but nevertheless he provides a suitably ambivalent, androgynous and faintly unsettling core to the proceedings. \n\nPerhaps more impressive is Chris Evans. Recently seen in a similarly hot headed role in the undercooked comic book adaptation &apos;Fantastic Four&apos;, he consistently snatches scenes from Murphy as engineer Mace, about as volatile and fiery as Cappa is composed and cool. Without Evan&apos;s energetic performance, the film would sink into an anti-libidinal quag. Mace&apos;s emotive instability injects pace when it&apos;s needed and brings some welcome variety to the otherwise glum faces. Evans is surely on the brink of big things. A small quibble would be that there are perhaps a few too many characters; meaning that a fair share of the cast never really gets a chance for development, which is irritating, as one gets the feeling that there&apos;s a lot of wasted potential.\n\nAnother chink in Sunshine&apos;s spacesuit, is in many places, Alex Garland&apos;s screenplay. Whilst he has a remarkable talent for creating intense psychological tension, of which there is plenty in Sunshine, his philosophising is much less satisfactory. This is not to say he doesn&apos;t play with some fascinating ideas. With the crew circling so close to the Sun, to the giver of life, Garland begins ask the biggest of questions. Is there something, something inestimably greater than ourselves, something that could create such a magnificent star, or are we, like the sun, simply dust? It&apos;s a great idea, but for the larger part of the film, it seems oddly shoehorned into what is at base a sci-fi pot-boiler. In fact these ideas are better expressed in Boyle&apos;s imagery. Time and time again we see members of the crew staring aghast at the immensity of the burning ball of gas and dust in front of them. The relationship between giver and taker is better explored here than in any line of Garland&apos;s. \n\nThe structure of his screenplay is also a little unwieldy. The first hour and a half play as an intense psychological study - the pace at times painfully weighty as the tension is ratcheted up ever higher. The film works beautifully here - it may not introduce anything particularly new; claustrophobic stress is certainly nothing new in sci-fi, but it follows genre conventions with such panache and artistry that it&apos;s difficult to fault. However, come the final 20 minutes, Sunshine takes a rather abrupt and unwelcome turn. A pretty hammy (not to mention poorly explained) plot twist is ushered in and suddenly we find ourselves in a horror film - a clichéd one at that. To say much more would spoil things, but needless to say, had the filmmakers showed a little restraint in the closing moments, they would have had a real classic on their hands. When the film ditches pretensions, and sticks with the clammy, slow burn thrills it excels at, it&apos;s fantastic. When it descends into predictable melodrama, it&apos;s still alright, it&apos;s just disappointing considering what we know it&apos;s capable of. As such it&apos;s remarkably well shot, superbly rendered, occasionally poignant and occasionally flawed. Whatever the case, Sunshine is never far from entirely thrilling, and, all said and done, film recommendations don&apos;t come much higher than that.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps the makers of this film thought it was time to update Tarzan and cash in on the secret agent craze that swept movies and television in the 60&apos;s. In this picture Tarzan played by Mike Henry is first seen stepping out of a helicopter in a suit and tie carrying a briefcase. Later he engages in a gun battle ala James Bond. \n\n Eventually he ends up back in the jungle sheds his coat and tie along with his pistol for his loin cloth and knife and takes on the bad guys who are equipped with machine guns, tanks and hi-tech explosives. Actually this Tarzan film although not one of the best is a great deal more entertaining than the 1981 Tarzan The Ape Man with Bo Derek. Along as his sidekicks are Manuel Padilla Jr who takes on the &quot;BOY&quot; role with the name of Remel and Nancy Kovacks who becomes sort of his Jane decked out in sexy female jungle safari clothes. His chimpanzee buddy goes by the name &quot;Dinky&quot;.  If your a Tarzan fan this film should be included in your viewing keeping in mind that the Tarzan character like Superman has been able to adjust to change through out the decades."

      "reviewBody": "Someone else put his finger on where this magnificent film falls short when he said, &quot;Mishima has already said it all, the film simply repeats.&quot; Ultimately, Schrader has made a movie which refuses to comment on Mishima one way or another, and which becomes somewhat lifeless and stilted in the final segment as a result. Because he is bending over backwards not to criticize Mishima, Schrader simply refuses to examine the uglier implications of his public suicide. \n\nIronically, this approach hurts the film precisely because Mishima himself was capable of much more perceptive self-criticism. In the first two chapters -- &quot;Beauty&quot; (THE GOLDEN PAVILION) and &quot;Art&quot; (KYOKO&apos;S HOUSE) Schrader&apos;s work is nothing short of brilliant. With great subtlety, he interweaves black and white scenes from Mishima&apos;s early life with lush full-color scenes from his early novels. What makes these sections so haunting are the subtle, suggestive differences between Mishima and the people he is writing about. For example, Mizoguchi, the acolyte who destroys the Golden Temple, is not a homosexual, nor is he a talented writer. His stammering could be a metaphor for those things, or it could be a metaphor for nothing at all. The mystery of creation and imagination, wordless and inexpressible, really seems to come to life here -- particularly in the dissolve where the schoolboy Mishima &quot;morphs&quot; into the slightly older Mizoguchi. \n\nThe problems start in the third chapter, &quot;Action.&quot; Here Schrader films scenes from Mishima&apos;s RUNAWAY HORSES (one of my personal favorites) as if they are not just similar, but absolutely interchangeable with Mishima&apos;s militarist activities with the Shield Society. Schrader seems to assume that the hero of the novel, Isao, is simply a stand in for Mishima. How can you tell? Because Schrader cuts out precisely those sections of the novel in which Mishima actually analyzes Isao&apos;s emotions and his illusions. The Isao of this movie is merely a straw man who spouts platitudes about the emperor and Japan&apos;s greatness. The Isao of the book is a courageous, unselfish, but very human teenage boy, whose callous and narrow-minded parents are unable to love and who plainly have had a crushing effect on his psyche. Mishima, whether consciously or not, included some truly vile scenes of parental cruelty and manipulation in this book precisely because he understood on some level that Isao&apos;s decision to end his own life was not entirely unselfish. The connection between the sordid ugliness of Isao&apos;s loveless home and his desire to die a violent death is clear enough in the book. But it is absent from the movie. Oddly enough, Schrader thinks he is protecting Mishima in the last section, by not moralizing about the suicide, but he is actually diminishing him as an author. \n\nThe RUNAWAY HORSES section is by far the weakest of the movie. The final scenes, in which Mishima at the moment of death attains &quot;oneness&quot; with his heroes, really are quite exhilarating. But they would have been still richer if Schrader had taken a more nuanced approach to RUNAWAY HORSES, instead of just viewing it as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for the last events in Mishima&apos;s life. \n\nThis is unquestionably a brilliant, inspiring film, but it&apos;s not quite flawless."

      "reviewBody": "Look - the situation is this: I&apos;ve got two toddlers, a tired wife, an allotment and a full time job. When I sit down to watch a film I&apos;m not there to be mildly amused by the juxtaposition of social hierarchies or what have you - I want things to move briskly, blow up, be gory, be naked, be crazy and above all not be boring. Hence: I like films like this.\n\nThis film is set in some futuristic Russia where people can plug themselves directly into things. I&apos;m not really sure if any of that was explained but the plugging in aspect seemed to involve fulfilling your dreams via cable or something. Anyhoo - Rutger is a smuggler smugling some biomechanical circuits when he&apos;s double crossed by his buddy Machis and shot in the head. His missus, who betrayed him, also gets shot in the head but when the Russian army turn up they burn her and get right to reviving Rutger using some sophisticamated doo-whackies. Obviously, when Rutger wakes up all he wants to do is shoot his partner in the head two or three hundred times.\n\nRutger sets out to kill everything (which is endorsed by the folks who revived him for reasons I couldn&apos;t quite understand) and therefore travels through Moscow in a series of set pieces which convey to me that the film had a higher budget than I thought or else filming in Russian is very cheap. Either way, the set design in this film is something to behold. Very impressive indeed.\n\nAnyhoo - Rutger hooks up with a hooker (Yvonne Scio) who also played his missus at the start (err..not sure why) and tries to track down Machis...However, it turns out that Machis is only the icing on the cake when it comes to Russian crime syndicates.\n\nLook - The story is flimsy as hell, and director Tibor (something or other) seems to realise this, and therefore fills the film full of nudity and gore. Believe me when I say this, but this film had more naked women than I&apos;ve seen outside of Italian cinema. Ever Rutger gets to do the nasty with Yvonne Scio (an Italian Scream Queen arriving 20 years too late), on several occasions, and if that ain&apos;t enough, he even gets attacked by naked assassins.\n\nAdd to that the gore (a guy having his fingers cut off and being fed them), and Rutger being attacked by machine gun wielding tramps - what are you waiting for? Oh, the ending? Lame, but the rest of the film is entertaining enough.",

      "reviewBody": "Eva Perón is the most emblematic female figure in all of Argentina and among many people who were involved in the Argentine government, Eva proved to be the most dignified and humble. Something that Argentina will never have again. Few films have been made about this famous historical figure and this present film was released a few months before Alan Parker&apos;s version. Each director who has made these films has narrated the figure of Eva Perón from her perspective, but without separating herself from how very significant she has been for the Argentine people. This film directed by Juan Carlos Desanzo makes an effort to respect the figure of Eva and although it is a film that has been somewhat forgotten, there is no doubt that it is one of the best films in Argentine cinema. The film focuses a lot on Eva&apos;s rise as a possible vice president and how her opportunity to reach beyond the top was interrupted due to cancer. Surely we expected to see Eva&apos;s entire life and her beginnings are only summarized in two flashbacks about her father&apos;s funeral and her first meeting with Perón. The film gives quite a bit of relevance to the figure of Eva and the way in which she has challenged the norms and prejudices established by the oligarchy. The script gives a very good depth to that and also to Eva as a character. We see in the film that she was a woman who has suffered a lot of stigmatization for being an illegitimate daughter due to the prejudices of the time. That was something that Eva wanted to change and the film makes her objective very clear in order to understand the change she wanted to propose. Esther Goris gives a fairly strong and believable performance as Eva making her dominate the entire film. You can see the firm and defiant character with which Eva challenged the oligarchy and has earned her the affection of many. We see a pretty strong and feisty Eva who is determined to try to achieve the goal of being the leader that Argentina needed. Even when she falls ill, she still continues to fight and resist quite stoically, leading her to become the martyr that she currently is. In that area, Esther offers a performance worthy of an Oscar award and even Víctor Laplace also offers a great performance as a Juan Domingo Perón who is present when Eva needs him. What is true is that the film leaves out a couple of events that could have contributed a lot and Alan Parker&apos;s version is the one that has made the effort to try to tell the complete story. This film also deserves a certain appreciation for offering a fairly realistic and human portrait of Eva Perón in her fight to create a better Argentina for those most in need. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "First of all, those guys out there who see the posters and advertising and assume this is some sappy chick flick, you couldn&apos;t be more wrong.  What it is, is an extraordinarily moving piece of work.  It&apos;s the kind of film that hits you right in the pit of your stomach.  Personally, my mind has a tendancy to wander during movies, but with this one, I was glued to it right from the first frame to the last.  It&apos;s been awhile since I found myself so touched by a movie.. and it reminds me of why I love movies in the first place.  The performances here are top notch.  Alison Lohman (Astrid), I never even heard of her before going to see this... but she tackles this difficult role like she has the experience of an award-winning veteran. I&apos;m not even sure most of the big names could pull off this role like she did. Michelle Pfeiffer (Ingrid), who I was never a big fan of, is also excellent...she has a character who&apos;s so beautiful, yet so repulsive at the same time.  The mother/daughter relationship her character has with Alison&apos;s is probably the most unconventional i&apos;ve seen in a film, and that&apos;s what makes it so compelling.  Renee Zellweger, as Clare, also gives her best performance here.  Her relationship with Astrid is a beautiful but ultimately a tragedy one, mainly due to Clare&apos;s infatuation with her cheating husband Mark (Noah Wyle), but I won&apos;t give it away of course! ;)\n\nAll I really have to say is, if you want to see a movie with strong performances throughout and an excellent story that will leave you fully satisified (and personally touched) when you leave the theatre, this one&apos;s for you.  I highly reccomend it to everyone! One last thing I should say though... quite often when a movie comes out that&apos;s based on a book, the cliche seems to be for people to say &quot;it wont be/wasnt as good as the book&quot;.  Now, I never read the book to this movie... but the way I look at it, people need to judge the movie for the movie... not the book.  If the directors were to follow the book word for word and detail for detail, we&apos;d be left with a movie that would probably take days to watch.  The advantage of a book is that you can have a complete knowledge of what the characters are feeling inside their head, which of course you can&apos;t always get in a movie unless they make it obvious or tell you how they&apos;re feeling truly.  The advantage of a movie is that it brings it all to life... and let&apos;s you witness it for what it&apos;d be like if you lived out the story.  After all, if you were witnessing these actions in real life, you wouldn&apos;t have a book to help you understand what thoughts caused them. So, to all the people who go hating a movie before they even see it, just because it&apos;s based on a book... keep in mind that the book and movie are essentially two different things and that both have their advantages. I&apos;ve honestly never seen a based-on-the-book movie where people were completely satisified with how it was translated to film.  You can like both the book and movie separately, you know! :)\n\nMy rating: 10 out of 10... HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m afraid to admit it, but WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM? is definitely one of my guilty pleasures which I have viewed multiple times and still find highly entertaining. This cute and entertaining comedy stars Garry Shandling as an alien sent to earth to impregnate a woman and bring the baby back to his planet. He ends up targeting a real estate agent and recovering alcoholic (Annette Bening) as his target, but he doesn&apos;t plan on complications like love, marriage, friends, business competitors...those little things that we earthlings deal with on a daily basis but an alien from another planet would have no concept of. The opening scenes of the aliens being educated on the female erogenous zones are quite amusing as is Shandling&apos;s explanations of women to aliens when he returns to his planet after impregnating Bening and stealing the baby. Bening is charming in a rare comedic turn and even gets to sing. Greg Kinnear scores as a slimy co-worker of Shandling&apos;s and Linda Fiorentino makes the most of her brief appearance as his sexy wife. John Goodman is solid as a cynical UFO investigator who can&apos;t get anyone to believe there is an alien on earth and has to deal with his paranoid wife (Caroline Aaron) who is convinced the man is cheating on her. Ben Kingsley, in a refreshing change of pace, plays the stone-faced leader of Shandling&apos;s planet and Camryn Manheim, Nora Dunn, and Ann Cusack appear as Bening&apos;s girlfriends. Shandling co-wrote this comedy, smoothly directed by Mike Nichols, of all people. It&apos;s no masterpiece, but there are worse ways to kill 90 minutes and there are laughs to be had along the way.",

      "reviewBody": "I would recommend this compilation film to anyone interested in the history of pornography in America, but I would NOT recommend to anyone looking to see a porn film for the purposes of getting turned on. This is mostly a collection of &quot;stag loops&quot; going all the way back to the silent era and including the oddly-titled &quot;Grass Sandwich&quot;, which is believed to be the oldest hardcore porn loop still in existence.\n\nThe most notorious of these loops though is the one from the 1950&apos;s titled (again, for some unclear reason) &quot;The Smart Aleck&quot;, which features legendary Texas stripper &quot;Candy Barr&quot;. Barr later claimed this was shot when, as a naive 17 year old, she was lured to a motel room and raped at gunpoint. Actually though, Barr neither looks anywhere close to seventeen here, nor like she was being raped. She does clearly refuse to perform oral sex on her partner (something rather unusual in porno as far as I know), but in the next scene she is shown calling a &quot;friend&quot; on the phone, who shows up and does the dirty deed. All this suggests to me, that Barr&apos;s was doing &quot;a Linda Lovelace&quot; (i.e. a lying to cover up something she was ashamed of), at least to some extent. Still, who knows? It&apos;s definitely strange in any case.\n\nThe film comes up to the present day (as of 1970) and some of the director&apos;s own work. These scenes are both unappetizing and excruciatingly boring. The hairiest moment (in more ways than one) involves a skanky 70&apos;s-era &quot;actress&quot; pleasuring herself in a scene that seemingly goes on forever. (Thank god for the soft focus or you might actually be able to see the crabs). All in all, this is rather dubious viewing. If you&apos;re looking for eroticism, you&apos;re better off going with one of those cable specials hosted by recent porn sensation Katie Morgan (as kind of a naked professor),which show a lot of the same basic footage (minus the Barr loop), but leave out the skankier &quot;modern&quot; stuff. Still as a purely historical curiosity this is kind of interesting. (This film itself was one of the first &quot;mainstream&quot; porn films back when it was first released)."

      "reviewBody": "The powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre, despite the ominous title. Jake Gyllenhaal guested on Conan O&apos;Brien to promote the movie and explained that &apos;Rendition&apos; was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture. Since 9/11, &apos;extraordinary rendition&apos; allowed the government&apos;s intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information.\n\nGyllenhaal plays rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (note the irony) who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the US. \n\nOmar Metwally plays the suspected terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, Egyptian national and green card-carrying hubby of American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son wait for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane&apos;s passenger manifest. She seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the Head of Intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it all. \n\nRendition is directed by Hollywood newbie Gavin Hood (who is set to do X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and begs the question of whether such &apos;extraordinary rendition&apos; is exercised in real life. The movie was released locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion (bombing/mishap?), and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer&apos;s spine. Seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign Aajala (Ayala?) on the upper right hand of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow-moving images magnified the impact of the scene&apos;s real-life coincidence. \n\nThere are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make, daily. We all have choices we can exercise at will, and we often do not always (want to) see how these affect others, who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance. What &apos;the greater good&apos; is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source. Now that&apos;s a utopia worth building.",

First of all, this is the final movie from the late (great) Divine, who sadly passed away a short while after the film was released. He is really good in this film, and plays one of the lead characters with humour, passion and with a heart. The film has, as John Waters other films too, many funny, and strange cameo appearances, who are amusing and entertaining. Debbie Harry shows her acting talent in this film too. The story is light and cheerful, but underneath it has a message who deals with a more serious matter, racism. John Waters brings back a world of 50-music and Dance in this film, and it&apos;s very well done. This is so much better than the remake and no one can play Edna better better than Divine although John Travolta did his best. Ricky Lake does a good job here, but is not the films biggest asset. A must see.",

Yet some deals are too good to be true as one night her boyfriend Mark (Corey Sevier) finds her in the middle of the street - having fallen from the balcony thirteen stories above.  \r\n\r\nWhen her sister Lara (Mischa Barton) tries to investigate the mystery of what happened, she moves into the same apartment and encounters the odd neighbors in the building, including an eerie nine-year old girl who seems to somehow know the real reason for JanetÂ’s fall.  Lara soon realizes that her sisterÂ’s death might spell the same fate for her unless she can overcome the strange events that are terrorizing the inhabitants in Apartment 1303.  \r\n\r\nUsing innovative 3D shooting techniques, director Michael Taverna creates a tense supernatural thriller that is adapted from a novel by Kei Ã”ishi.\r\n",

      "reviewBody": "In the Victorian England, the teenagers Flora (Verna Harvey) and her brother Miles (Christopher Ellis) have just lost their parents in a car accident in France. Their tutor (Harry Andrews) decides to leave the children alone in their huge mansion under the care of the old housekeeper Mrs. Grose (Thora Hird), the governess Miss Jessel (Stephanie Beacham) and the gardener Peter Quint (Marlon Brando). Miles and Flore are very connected to Peter, who misleads their education with twisted concepts of love and death, but the orphans believe and are fascinated by his knowledge. Peter is the lover of Jessel, and they use to have sadomasochistic sex. When Peter sees their kink bondage night of sex, he has a corrupted and perverted sexual initiation. When Mrs. Grose writes to the master of the house to fire Miss Jessel and Peter Quint, Flora and Miles plot a dark scheme to keep them together in the property.\n\n&quot;The Nightcomers&quot; is a very dark tale about finding sexuality and losing innocence in a very twisted way. The performances of the cast are top-notch, but Marlon Brando leads the story with his usual competence. I have never had the chance to read &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot; or see &quot;The Innocents&quot; to make any comparison, but I really liked this unknown and underrated movie. The bondage scenes are very impressive, with Marlon Brando and Stephanie Beacham showing a great chemistry. It is impressive to see that Verna Harvey was twenty-years old in 1972. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Os Que Chegam Com a Noite&quot; (&quot;The Nightcomers&quot;)",

Look sharply for Vondie Curtis Hall (of tv&apos;s &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;) as an overly welcoming fellow native stateside; Cuba Gooding Jr. in a blink-and-you&apos;ll miss cameo (getting a haircut) and the clever inserting of Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the Randolph Brothers from Murphy&apos;s and director John Landis&apos; previous joint effort &quot;Trading Places&quot;.

The scenes where she slowly learns the art of being insincere and how to skirt around the truth are also a lot of fun.\n\nBut the joke goes on for too long, and musically also the film takes a downward slide towards the end. Musically, both stars were capable of handling much better material than they were given in this film, and it&apos;s a shame that, while there are some pretty little songs in the early part, there is not one really memorable musical number that allowed them to shine as only they could.\n\nBut the pair handle the inferior material as well as anyone could, and there is still a special magic between them.\n\nJust a pity about the heavy censorship of the Hayes Office, and the lack of a really good score.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ramona&quot; is a women&apos;s picture all the way. There is much weeping, strife and bitterness and, of course, redemption at the end. This version is the third of four that have been brought to the screen since 1910 and is the last silent rendition. It is an oddity in that it is a romance/western, and there are very few of those.\n\nAs stated by the reviewer above, it stars Warner Baxter, and Dolores Del Rio as Ramona. The picture gets a big boost by the presence of hatchet-faced Vera Lewis as Ramona&apos;s step-mother, who steals each scene she&apos;s in with her fierce presence. By turns, the three principals suffer and reflect a great deal of sorrow. Often the mood is broken by cue cards, this being a silent picture, and so the level of grief is ramped up to bridge the presence of the cue cards. No such problem existed with the 1936 sound version. Overall I thought this silent version was more effective in conveying the feelings of the players.\n\nThis film played last week at Capitolfest in Rome,N.Y. A print was found in the Czechoslovakian Film Library and was updated and restored by the Library of Congress."

But you need to have the right sense of humor. Gene Siskel obviously did not have the correct type of humor, as he is reported to have walked out on this film. Well, that was one of his biggest mistakes, because there are far worse movies out there! \n\nChris Farley was funny as hell, I don&apos;t think anyone should object to that. David Spade still is pretty funny (although he lost a lot of points with me when he did JOE DIRT).\n\nI thought this film was actually pretty good. The other members of the cast were good: Tim Matheson, Gary Busey, Grant Heslov, and Bruce McGill. All of them were funny as hell. Maybe with the exception of Gary Busey&apos;s character, who I must admit was pretty stupid. The film had a good story though, and it was sweet-natured along iwth being majorly crude and funny. I recommend ALMOST HEROES and TOMMY BOY *if* you liked this movie. BLACK SHEEP gets 4/5."

My disc has the ambiguous title of The Deadly Organ on it but it is almost universally known as, Feast of Flesh and with this title accompanies, Night of the Bloody Apes on the Something Weird label. To be honest The Deadly Organ is more appropriate but this is a tale with a monster, some girls and a lot of police guys doing a lot of chatting and no story at all. The night club scenes are OK because we get some silly dancing and the passable music but I must mention here that we also get, apropos nothing whatsoever, a striptease and it is the worst I have ever seen.",

After that, the story settles down into a court battle. \n\nIts politics are typical Hollywood: the government is corrupt with the main villain the National Security Adviser who burns a video tape that would clear a U.S. Marine colonel from being framed for murder. That colonel also is a black man which makes the story even more politically correct. Samuel J. Jackson plays that role, a Col. &quot;Terrry Childers.&quot; Jones plays his attorney, &quot;Col. Hayes Hodges.&quot; The two veteran actors play off each other very well.\n\nIt gets even more dramatic when two other witnesses lie and make justice look almost impossible to attain in the case. But, dramatics aside, it&apos;s a good story and certainly an entertaining one. Once again, William Friedkin has directed a good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Science-fiction and fantasy are not exactly common genres in Bollywood, but fortunately for us, there are a few exceptions. And although the Mumbai-based film industry has grown pretty mature over the last ten years, Chandra Mukhi is a cute example from well before that. It&apos;s one piece of work, believe me. Don&apos;t expect a masterpiece if you decide to watch it, but be in for a real treat.\n\nIt all happens somewhere in East Africa, although the only thing that adds some couleur locale are a few zebras, giraffes and a lion at the very beginning of the movie, because during the entire movie we won&apos;t encounter a single black person, as if East Africa were inhabited exclusively by Hindi-speaking Indians. The hero of our story is Raju, an about 8 years old kid, who spends most of his time playing around with his friends. Raju&apos;s grandfather is a rich businessman, and Raju is the apple of his eye. However, Raju&apos;s maternal uncle Madan and his wife Kamini are not pleased with Raju&apos;s privileged position at all. Madan and Kamini are evil people (&quot;He could do harm to normal people, but he can&apos;t do harm to us, because we are EVIL PEOPLE, mwahahahaaaaa!&quot;). Together they run a small gang of cartoonesque goons, and their plan is to bump off grandpa and Raju in order to get hold of grandpa&apos;s huge property. However, their plans don&apos;t work out as they should. Because what happens? Somewhere far, far away in the universe lies a heavenly kingdom ruled by a severe but kind-hearted queen. The queen has a beautiful daughter (played by Sridevi) with a peculiar hobby: the princess enjoys floating (!) over Earth, and the queen cannot approve of that, because Earth is a wicked and dangerous place. To prevent her from going there, the queen entrusts the princess with a magical golden leaf, the key to all power in the universe. But of course, the princess goes anyway and stumbles upon Dhola (a huge bald fellow in a superhero suit who wants to kill the princess, steal the leaf and take over power), so that she loses the leaf, falls down and loses her power. Down on Earth, she quickly makes friends with Raju and the other kids. They name her Chandra Mukhi after one of the Devdas characters. When Chanda Mukhi witnesses how bad poor Raju is treated by his evil uncle, she decides to help him, using all the power that is left in her to turn him into an adult muscle-man overnight. Of course, it won&apos;t last long before Raju (played by Salman Khan) and the sympathetic alien princess fall in love.\n\nThese are the basic ingredients. Just add an evil sorcerer, a tribe, a village, a lonely cannibal and a band of merry thieves - all this apparently within a radius of a few miles at most - to the mix and you&apos;ll get an idea. Those who enjoy watching Salman&apos;s naked chest will, as usual, not be disappointed either.\n\nChandra Mukhi has lots of elements that would easily qualify it as a low-budget movie of the &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot; genre. Yet, that wouldn&apos;t entirely do justice to the movie. It has visibly been made with humor and an odd kind of love. Sridevi plays her role charmingly and decently, and besides, she&apos;s a terrific dancer. Salman may never have been a great actor, but his acting still had some of the freshness that later got lost in mannerisms. Gulshan Grover is funny in the role of Madan. For the rest, the whole thing is just incredibly naive and delightfully absurd - even for a children&apos;s movie.",

      "name": "Eastwood and Angeline deliver a strong punch",
      "reviewBody": "There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as &quot;Mystic River&quot;, &quot;Letters&quot;, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; and now &quot;Changeling&quot;. True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.\n\nEastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn, Freeman, Swank, Hackman, and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood&apos;s movies, and that leads to the center of this film: Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks, let&apos;s state something clearly, the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force, proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras, but that when she is working for a director, she gives her best, regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona, keep it to yourself, concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.\n\nAs the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child, Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won&apos;t quit, and it&apos;s admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child, and it&apos;s quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.\n\nHer battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film, as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.\n\nThe film contains amazing production values, as we are taken back to an era that doesn&apos;t exist anymore. The recreation of the time Los Angeles was on its way to being a real city is incredible, as we see it before it fell apart and spread all over a gigantic geographical area, losing its identity. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film, and there are some moments bound to become classic, as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Changeling&quot; may be very difficult to sit through, but it is not less impressive, effective or good than any of the last five films Eastwood has made. As a matter of fact, it&apos;s just one masterpiece from the man who could teach Hollywood a few lessons.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Abhinav Kashyap puts Salman Khan in Rajnikant&apos;s shoes in action sequences while the film&apos;s setting in U.P gives it a grand scope to explore the bhojpuri realm and take advantage of it for entertainment through dialogs and characters. Although the plot is dead simple, it still has enough juice in it to keep its momentum going with action, romance, comedy and Salman&apos;s screen presence. There is something about Salman&apos;s performance here that may not necessarily be charismatic but it engages you enough to make you whistle even in a multiplex (although this is totally a G7 or Chandan movie). This is Sunny Deol on drugs and Rajnikant revamped for Bollywood. Dabangg is different from &apos;Wanted&apos; yet similar in Salman&apos;s prowess against adversaries. \n\nThe music by Sajid-Wajid-Lalit is hummable with Tere Mast Mast and full of masti with Munni Badnaam and Humka Peeni hai. Reminiscent of &apos;Omkara&apos;s title song is Hud Hud Dabangg with excellent cinematography. Salman in all these songs is a charmer and looks to be enjoying the filming completely. There is no choreography. Just some drinks on- the- house. \n\nAs the unstoppable Macho-man, Salman Khan excels in action sequences. He is, of course known to be stiff and it becomes very apparent while he is dancing but it is fun to watch no doubt, when he lets loose in most songs and just goes wild. Delivering bhojpuri dialogs, threats and romanticism, Salman Khan earns your whistling and hooting. Wanted and Dabangg both would&apos;ve been catastrophic flops if it weren&apos;t for Salman re-inventing himself. Here, he doesn&apos;t look like he is out to prove that point. Most of the time, you can see him simply enjoying himself. Arbaaz Khan is passable but could&apos;ve been sillier to add to the fun as Makhi. Om Puri, Vinod Khanna and Anupam Kher in cameos were superlative while Mahesh Manjrekar delivered a shockingly good performance as a drunkard father. Sonu Sood has been better in &apos;Jodha Akbar&apos; but he is quite adequate as Chulbul Pandey&apos;s adversary. Newcomer Sonakshi Sinha looks beautiful, can put up a straight face pretty well and can compete well against her contemporaries. \n\nIt goes without saying that Dabangg was never going to be an intellectual enricher. This is pure, flawed entertainment and that is how it needs to be enjoyed. The action seems like a spoof of our southern counterparts and therefore, is fun to watch. Dialogues, however rude at times: &apos;haraamzade se yaad aaya, aapke sasur kaise hai?&apos; are thoroughly laugh worthy and the sensational cinematography around Salman&apos;s entry at various points in the film augments his heroism. Considering these factors, Dabangg offers tremendous value for money and is no surprise that it opened to such an overwhelming response. Nevertheless, this is not going to be a revolution in Bollywood but just a passing tide and it better remain that way."

First, i have always thought that making movies about movies is the emptiness of imagination ! Then, all the sex scenes are disappointing : they are badly framed and above all, they happen in unfit locations for sex : mostly sofa or a dinner ! Sure, Taylor is stunning and really appears to be one of the most beautiful woman ever with her original and distinctive traits ! In addition, she is really into this and doesn&apos;t act like a wood panel ! But she is not used with talent here even she is in total spotlight ! And to nail it, i thank very much the late digital technology as the image quality of the movie is just awful like all Vivid movies of that time : strange colors, dark cinematography !",

      "reviewBody": "I bought this movie out of sheer curiosity. I&apos;d heard about it somewhere, something about it being a cult classic based on a true story. Anthony Wong was in it and I liked him in Hard Boiled and Full Contact, so I said what the hell. I ordered it on DVD and watched it as soon as I got it. Man, this movie is something. It&apos;s one of those movies where you watch it wondering if the cast and crew went home and had horrible nightmares every work day. There&apos;s stuff in this movie that doesn&apos;t quite leave your mind. I&apos;ve shown this movie to several people, one in particular swearing off Chinese food to this very day. Anthony Wong gives one hell of a performance. It&apos;s not necessarily Oscar-caliber (even though I don&apos;t really dig the Oscars these days anyway) but it&apos;s just... very convincing. A little bit hammy maybe but yeesh, this guy is scary. My friend asked me once while watching it one day if Wong was really nuts. Judging from the look on Wong&apos;s face in most scenes I said yes. The murder scenes are better left undescribed because no amount of words can prepare you for when you&apos;re actually watching them. The only gripe I have with this movie is the comedy element. I think the best comparison would be to &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;, where it was almost like watching two different movies spliced together. The comedy feels out-of-place and my idea is that they added it to lighten the movie up a little bit for the murder scenes are pretty intense. If you are one of the faint-of-heart, avoid. If you got guts, give this a look. One other thing: after watching this, you will never look at chopsticks the same way again. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****."

It&apos;s a movie about realities, about the stories that all of us could have had experienced, everything was so common, realistic, and beautiful, the ending music of this movie is a song called &quot;The Red Dragonfly&quot;, with that beautiful undecorated scenery of Taiwan countryside, the movie ended in a poem, a picture...

This is an entirely different story concocted by the screenwriters and I must say it&apos;s the best work of fiction on film that involves the Amityville house.\n\nThe cinematography is great, the music, while not Schifrin, is still chilling, the acting is very very good. And there are some really scary moments in the film. The overall story I think engulfs the viewer. It&apos;s really interesting because the main character believes it&apos;s all a hoax, (much like a portion of the people do today) and he comes to find out that things in Amityville are much more unsettling than he thought they&apos;d be.\n\nThe only thing (as with all 80&apos;s 3-D films) is that there are obvious things going on which were supposed to lurch out at the audience. It seems rather silly when the camera stays on a certain image for more than five seconds when it is no longer presented in it&apos;s 3-D image. It induces a chuckle when ever this happens, but it doesn&apos;t detract from the film itself."

      "reviewBody": "I have to admit that I started watching this documentary with low expectations, particularly because of its insufficient and irrelevant one-liner in IMDb. Actually, although this documentary tells about &apos;military cooking&apos;, it manages to put it into a historical. at the same time very human context.\n\nThe documentary starts with details on cooks and cooking in the German and Russian armies during the Second World War. It visit Hungarian military cooks who happened to witness Soviet occupation in 1956, then continues with two French military cooks with different viewpoints on the Algerian occupation, then it visits Czechoslovakia in 1968, again, during the Soviet Occupation. The next stop is Yugoslavia, but then, we have an interesting guest, the cook of Josip Bros Tito. Afterwards, we witness the disintegration of the same country through two different eyes / cooks. There is an epilogue as well, of which I wouldn&apos;t give any details.\n\nTo be honest, such a topic can be handled in a wide scope ranging from extremely boring to extremely loose. I think Peter Kerekes was concerned enough about that, so that he always yearns for a discourse. The other that he is good at is, although the historical venues I mentioned above are mostly eclectic, he tried to catch a common pattern by asking &apos;thick&apos; questions about the similarities in military orders and recipes, about war, about occupation and collaborators, about killing. Nevertheless, humour is always there.\n\nOne last note: in the movie you&apos;ll watch animals getting killed in various ways, for their meat. These are deeply disturbing scenes, but I think, as a vegetarian, any meat eater should be disturbed.",

      "reviewBody": "Firstly, can I just say that this has to be one of the most unoriginal movies I have ever seen. It steals from just about every prison movie ever made, especially &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, &quot;Lock Up&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; etc, and with a bit of &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; thrown in for good measure. So, if this is the case then why have I given the movie 8 out of 10? Because it&apos;s the best Van Damme movie I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nJean-Claude&apos;s films are made to appeal to fans of the kind of action film that disappeared from cinemas about 10 years ago: the unthinking, violent, easy-on-the-brain popcorn fodder that he, Arnie and Sly used to churn out by the bucket load. These days, Van Dame is much like Seagal in that all their films go direct-to-video (or DVD, as it now is). However, where as Seagal&apos;s post-fame efforts are united by their awfulness, Van Damme has, with &quot;In Hell&quot;, made a real effort to do something a bit different.\n\nSo, he has no real martial arts skills, and no cheesy one-liners. Instead, he actually acts, and it&apos;s quite something to behold. Okay, he&apos;s never going to win any awards, but it&apos;s nice to see he&apos;s making the effort. Director Ringo Lam shoots the movie brilliantly, making it look a trillion pounds when in fact it probably cost about 50p to make. The supporting cast are quite good as well, with no terrible performances rearing up to ruin the film. I must admit, too, that I was quite moved by certain sections, and you could really feel for the prisoners trapped &apos;in hell&apos; (what a title!).\n\nSo, in conclusion, give this movie a watch, and enjoy it- just ignore that you probably know where the plot is going long before it&apos;s even got there.",

It would work even better if Justin starts investigating sooner. It&apos;s not until midpoint when Justin goes off into the field. The flashbacks could be incorporated into the investigating. The little clues are better if Justin is looking for them. Otherwise, this is a first class movie. It has an exotic African location, great performances, and a passionate story with a social angle. This is one of those great murky John le Carré espionage tales.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know about you, but I like my superheroes to be a bit dark, and my animated programs to be more than kiddie fare. This 2-part intro to the Batman Beyond series excels on both counts.\n\nThe animation won&apos;t win any awards, but it is consistently stylish and interesting. There is plenty of action and humour. But what really makes the show great is the real human drama it portrays. The show introduces us to Terry McGinnis, the new Batman, a headstrong teenager of the near future who takes up the cowl after a personal tragedy.\n\nBut the real focus of this episode is the original Batman, Bruce Wayne, now a lonely old man. For those of us who are fans of the Batman (especially those of us who loved The Dark Knight Returns, which should be animated into a nifty movie), this makes beautiful sense. The characters are well realised and, even better, well acted.\n\nIf you&apos;re afraid of anything that isn&apos;t classic Batman, I still urge you to check out this show. It has an engaging story, believable characters, and enough face-kicking to keep everybody happy.",

Karl Maria Brandauer is magnificent as Hendrik Höfgen, the obsessed &quot;actor&quot; who will do anything to gain wealth and fame.  He first betrays the world around him, and then his inner values are swept away as he finally enters the inner sanctum of Nazi Germany.  Is true theatre on stage or in the handshake that Höfgen makes in the prime minister&apos;s box behind the audience?  Everything in this movie revolves around Höfgen&apos;s downward spiral into the abyss; the initial ascent to stardom was but an illusion.  Mann instinctively knew that tragedy would befall his country when a pact was made between Hitler and the financial, industrial and military élites of Germany - remember the book was written nine years before that country&apos;s downfall.  View the movie and read the book.  Two truly artistic achievements! Thumbs up to István Szabó and K.M. Brandauer who managed to reveal everything in Höfgen&apos;s character.",

First their stories each go on without any connection, however, facing the world&apos;s end, their stories starts to link.\n\nFirst, the structure of story is full of surprise. For a long time I like the original novel before watching this film. Sometimes movies which based on novels betray the original fans, this movie do not. The casts each suit the characters (especially I like Masashi!) and the song which&quot;Gekirin&quot; performs is taken charge of Kazuyoshi Saito and more than just a movie sound. \n\nThis movie describes an imaginary miracle but shows us the importance of taking an action actively. When I am puzzled with something, the scene of Masashi always inspires me with courage."

As is Gottfried John who delights as the diabolical Dr. Droz.\n\nThe Quays have succeeded yet again in creating a strangely compelling parallel universe, falling somewhere between German Expressionism and Kafkaesque Surrealism.\n\nThe twins have generally been tagged as image-makers rather than story-tellers. That is not necessarily true, as each picture says a thousand words.\n\nIf you approach PTOE on a purely sensory level - you will be in for a spellbinding ride in which time will cease to exist. If you approach it as a conventional narrative, you will instead find yourself looking constantly at your watch.\n\nAlice or the white rabbit - it&apos;s really your choice.",

      "name": "Mechagodzilla Returns.",
      "reviewBody": "Terror of Mechagodzilla follows &quot;Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla&quot;. It would be the last film from the original &quot;Showa&quot; series of Godzilla Films.\n\nA submarine goes looking for the remains of Mechagodzilla. It is attacked by a giant dinosaur monster known as Titanosaurus. Later the Simians make a return to Earth and align with a scientist called Dr. Mafune. They bring Mechagodzilla up and repair him and also control Titanosaurus as well. Mafune&apos;s daughter Tetsura is killed, so the Simians insert a control for Mechagodzilla into her. Soon the Simians unleash Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus on Tokyo. Godzilla appears and appears to be the only thing that can save the Earth.\n\nMechagodzilla returns in this film. Definitely one of Godzilla&apos;s greatest foes, so it was no surprise that he appeared in another film with Godzilla. Mechagodzilla is a little different acting in this film in that he must wait for Tetsura to give commands. Also his fingers are longer and has revolving missiles added to his arsenal. Also if Mechagodzilla loses his head he has a smaller head underneath that fires a powerful beam of energy. Mechagodzilla can still function without his head in this film. He just can not function once Tetsura is destroyed.\n\nMechagodzilla is not by himself in this film. Titanosaurus assists him in battle with Tokyo and Godzilla. Titanosaurus is a bright red and yellow color and has a long neck and tail that becomes like a fan to create wind storms. Also he can jump far and is quite a formidable fighter. However Titanosaurus is not really an evil monster, he is just taken control of by Mafune and the Simians and forced to be evil. A really good monster that only shows up in this film, but I like that he is in it. In fact, Titanosaurus is the main monster in this film and is on screen more than Godzilla and Mechagodzilla.\n\nGodzilla is not in this movie as much as he probably should be, he is over shadowed by both Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla. This really is more of a Mechagodzilla film than a Godzilla film. But Godzilla does get his fair share of action towards the end. Godzilla has no help in this film, it is him against both Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus. That is pretty cool.\n\nThe monster action is pretty good in this film. Mechagodzilla gets to do some awesome destruction scenes on Japan. Godzillas fight with Mechagodzilla at the end of this film I think is a better overall fight because both monsters get to get in some action. It is not just one sided. There is no blood spilling all over the place in this one, I am not complaining just saying that I guess they thought that they went overboard in the last film.\n\nFOr the most part I thought the acting was good in this film. The young man who is in love with Getsura really shows great emotion and the SImians and Dr. Mafune are good bad guys.\n\nThe story is great. It starts off with a search for Mechagodzilla&apos;s head. Then Titanosaurus appears and becomes the main focus for a while. Then Godzilla shows up and later Mechagodzilla comes back. Just a lot of good timing for monsters entering. A really well written and well acted film. This is one of the best and most under rated of the entire series.\n\nThe music is great. It is not the same score from Terror of Mechagodzilla, it is different and more darker sounding. I guess they made great music a priority in the films starring Mechagodzilla. THis is one of my favorite music scores from any Godzilla movie.\n\nComplaint, well this will be tough. I guess one thing is that if you are watching this film to see Mechagodzilla you have to wait a long time to see him up and going. But that is really nitpicking.\n\nOne last thing, the Japanese Version has quite a few differences. FOr one when the Simians are turning Tetsura into a cyborg you can see her nude breasts, I think that is the only nudity in a Godzilla Film. Also the American Version completely botches the ending where Tetsura must make a vital decision in regards to saving herself or the planet. I do not want to give away too much.\n\nA great film. If you liked Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla then you will love this one. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "The protagonist is a stuffy little bureaucrat from a small town arriving for his honeymoon in Rome with his very sheltered (only a bit more than himself) young bride. He has few romantic thoughts on his mind. His main concern is a meeting with his uncle, a minor official at the Vatican, who has arranged an audience with the Pope.\n\nWhile the jerk is taking a nap, his bride plots a momentary escape to fulfill her one wild fantasy---A meeting with the &quot;White Sheik&quot; a hero of the &quot;frumetti&quot;---a sort of trashy photographic comic book popular in 50s Italy---to whom she has sent red hot fan mail. She learns that the studio is only a few blocks from the hotel and resolves to meet her secret love for just a minute and get back to the hotel in time. Through a comedy of errors she is accidentally &quot;abducted&quot; to a shooting session where she learns to be careful about what she wishes for. Meanwhile, her husband is desperately searching for her and coming up with all kinds of frantic excuses to his family for her absence. I won&apos;t describe the movie any further for the benefit of those who wish to see it.\n\nA very effective comedy with plenty of innuendo for adults and even some slapstick and sight gags. Loads of laughs for young and old. A very sweet story that nevertheless contains some of the surrealistic elements of Fellini&apos;s later work. If possible, get the subtitled version. The Italian language enhances the comical effect. A real gem.",
