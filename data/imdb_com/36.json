This is a garbage Gremlins knock-off with no humor, charm, or entertainment value. The best thing about it is that it has one of the coolest movie posters of the 1980&apos;s, with the Ghoulie coming up out of the toilet. It&apos;s just not a fun movie at all. It&apos;s nasty and cheap. Avoid this mess. See Gremlins instead. Or you can just skip this one and watch the better Ghoulies part 2. But yeah, Gremlins is better than that too. So just watch Gremlins or even Critters over this dreck.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Noises Off&quot; is based on a popular play. Directed by Peter Bogdonavich, it tells the story of a bedroom farce, &quot;Nothing On,&quot; which is, in fact, a dud of a play - and what goes on backstage and on-stage as the actors rehearse, play out of town, and open on Broadway. Thanks to break-ups, jealousies, and drunkenness, the offstage happenings spill over into the play, as the actors grow to hate one another more and more. Anyone with experience in theater will love it the most, but it&apos;s fun for everyone.\n\nThe cast is top-notch - Michael Caine is the harried director, and the stars of the &quot;play&quot; are Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Christopher Reeve, Marilu Henner, Nicolette Sheridan, Mark-Linn Baker, and Denholm Elliott. Julie Hagerty is the near-hysterical stage manager.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of slapstick and much &quot;actor talk&quot; with the actors searching for motivations; there&apos;s a drunk actor (Elliott) who pops up from time to time asking if it&apos;s his cue yet. (Soon, the cast finds his stash of booze and start chugalugging themselves.) Caine is terrific as a Valium-popping director driven to near-madness. \n\nThe play is much better than the film, even though the film is terribly funny.\n\nUnfortunately, for me anyway, it&apos;s just terribly sad to see handsome, robust Christopher Reeve walking around and the talented, deceased John Ritter. Boy, life sure has some same twists. So does &quot;Noises Off&quot; - but unlike some of life&apos;s twists, these twists are accompanied by plenty of belly laughs.",

Much of the comedy is pure low-grade slapstick - doors slammed in faces, people tripping over buckets of water or being punched in the privates ... you get the idea. The &apos;story&apos; such as it is, involves some valuable paintings hidden in the hospital.\n\nNadia Cassini performs an embarrassingly awful song &apos;n&apos; dance number about halfway through. She is admittedly easily on the eye - as is former giallo queen Nieves Navarro (billed here as Susan Scott)who contributes a couple of fairly unsexy (for her) nude scenes. Even so, these provide the only possible reason for watching this strange little movie.",

      "name": "Mel is Back as a detective with drama, intrigue and action",
      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie at an early screening and was delighted.\n\nI give this movie three stars out of four, or 8 of ten points for great characters, intrigue, and some startling action scenes. It looses the 2 points because it does tend to slow down a little and become more dramatic at times but if you are a Mel Gibson fan you probably won&apos;t mind that at all. This movie reminded me a little of Taken, with a whole lot of Enemy of the State, and just a touch of Jason Bourne. Mel Gibson is engaging in his first acting role in years, although he definitely looks older now. It&apos;s hard to watch Gibson here without thinking of Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon and there is some carryover but here Craven played by Gibson is the older, caring, Father who is also a cop although there is still some of of the craziness that made Mel so dynamic in a number of his roles. In some ways Mel reminded me here a little of Clint Eastwood in movies like Absolute Power and In the Line of Fire as the more mature protagonist who combines maturity and cunning with a fierce side that comes out in battle.\n\nIt&apos;s not giving anything away to say that the story is about Mel Gibson&apos;s character trying to find out who killed his daughter as that much is in the trailer. Mel plays a veteran detective and so has skills and resources we civilians don&apos;t. The movie takes a while to develop and takes great pains to show the love of Craven for his daughter in the opening scenes and then periodically remind us in flashbacks. There are a lot of characters which seem to be critical to building the intrigue of the movie; activists, defense contractors, government officials and various henchmen. The movie does a good job for a while of hiding who is working for whom. Suspense does build for most of the movie but a good bit before the end it is evident what is going on and the movie shifts from an action thriller to more of an pure action movie.\n\nRay Winstone plays an intriguing role as Jedburgh, deftly showing protagonist and antagonist sides at different times in a mysterious role. Danny Huston plays a multi-dimensional character, Jack Bennet, that is fun to watch. Bojana Novakovic as Emma Craven is a sweetheart. Jay O. Sanders plays a solid role as Detective Whitehouse.\n\nThe movie is definitely heavy on violence and acting independent of authority although I don&apos;t remember any swearing or sex scenes. Still it requires a mature audience as the hero&apos;s actions are probably not ones you want your kids emulating in your house. As with so many movies it portrays sides of business and government at their worst. So,since it is light on sexuality and vulgarity I would suggest that if you let your older kids go that you still discuss the extreme portrayals of the police, use of force, business and government.\n\nIt&apos;s good to see Mel back in action.",

The family lived in Connaught Sq London, near Marble Arch, and I enjoyed many amusing lunches there particularly when Peter Cook turned up and the red wine was flowing like water.\n\nBy the time I joined the movie most of the filming was done and a lot of work was being done on the sound track. John was a perfectionist and the recording sessions often went late into the night. I remember the &quot;end of shoot&quot; party quite well, It was only across Hyde Park but the traffic was so busy John and his wife decided to catch the tube instead, but I cut through Mayfair and got there first. I thought maybe John would be annoyed at me arriving first, but he was very laid back that it wasn&apos;t a problem. He had 3 Au Pair girls, 2 Americans, and 1 Australian. I was going out with the Australian girl and she was mainly responsible for me moving to Australia.\n\nIn short, I enjoyed my experience working on the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Writer and director Paul Andrew Williams surely knew his stuff with The Children (2008) and The Cottage (2008). Cherry Tree lane tries to make a horror about strangers invading a house but this time it&apos;s more about some hoodlums who are after the son of the house who has been clicking to the police. I can understand that for some it all looks like it could happen with themselves or their neighbours but it is a bit low on brutality or red stuff. So I won&apos;t say it was bad but it was more a flick with a message if you just watch the end. I would rather say it&apos;s a kind of thriller, drama.\n\nWhat makes it more a thing that could happen to yourself is the fact that they spoke in their dialect. It surely shows how society is today but if you leave the message out of this flick then there isn&apos;t that much happening. The rape is done off-camera only to make the viewer think what will happen or what is going on upstairs. Maybe the last 10 minutes are a bit shocking for the easily offended but don&apos;t think that you will see Straw Dogs (1971) or The Last House On The Left (1972), therefore it doesn&apos;t have enough brutality or shocking moments. I can also understand why horror buffs don&apos;t like it. Just watch Inside (À l&apos;intérieur (2007) instead if you want a gory disturbing house-invasion movie.\n\nMixed feelings about Cherry Tree Lane and I can understand why. Acting was rather okay but surely not an exploitation as those 70&apos;s revenge flicks.",

      "reviewBody": "I was about to turn off the TV as opening titles rolled for Silver Bullet and I saw the &quot;Cycle of the Werewolf&quot; reference, as I really don&apos;t care much for fantasy monsters at all. This being a Stephen King, though, I thought I&apos;d give it a look. I&apos;m glad I did.\n\nThe difference between this and the standard, cookie-cutter, grade-B monster/werewolf/e-mail-spammer horror flick could be a tutorial for playwrights, screenwriters and cinematographers. Instead of the tired horror-flick plot - monster terrorizes small town after killing some folks (usually with heavy-handed special-effects gore, repeated frequently throughout); populace panics and does a lot of stupid things; standard-issue hero arrives; standard-issue sexy young heroine falls in love with him and the movie ends with the standard-issue hero dispatching the monster moments before monster is about to make standard-issue heroine his/her/its next victim - this one deftly draws on strong theatrical principles and creativity to make the viewing real entertainment.\n\nThe young protagonist, who could be a paraplegic edition of ELL-LEE-YUHHT from E.T., his mid-teenage sister, which character, as an adult, opens the story with off-camera narrative (by Tovah Feldshuh), and an equally-charming third kid, who happens to be the boy&apos;s uncle and is chronologically but in no other respect an adult, endearingly played by Gary Busey, are developed skilfully as characters in their own right, entirely apart from the werewolf theme. By making us know and care about them, as well as the lesser characters, King creates a warm and personal relationship between them and the audience, something rarely achieved in standard horror/suspense fare. Busey is just right as the uncle who finds responsibility to be rather an impediment to enjoying life.\n\nInjecting just the right touch of comedy where you&apos;d least expect it and making it work - to avoid spoiling, I&apos;ll just say something about the woods at night and a bunch of people who don&apos;t belong there - a few red herrings to keep you guessing, and one broad clue to the identity of the werewolf that the sharp-eyed and -eared might catch but is otherwise not at all tipping a hand, all combine to hold the interest and attention of the viewer. The knitting-together of various threads - the significance of the monster&apos;s attack on the suicidal woman, for one - creates a certain intricacy that typical monster-flick shows rarely have.\n\nSome blood and gore is unavoidable in a story like this; but again, it&apos;s handled with skill and delicacy instead of blunt force. The attack scenes are crafted to use the viewer&apos;s imagination much more than the special-effects department to create the impression. Watch carefully and you&apos;ll notice that the illusion is created by alternating very brief flashes of action streaking by the lens, almost too fast to discern, with establishing shots of the victim&apos;s accumulating injuries, with the audio gluing it all together. A few frames of the monster&apos;s snout or eyes moving past, a claw (or later on, a club or baseball bat) streaking by, but not not visibly headed for any particular target, horrified looks and increasing amounts of blood from the victim who may get tossed across the room or otherwise propelled violently but you never see the propelling directly, and your imagination does the rest.\n\nIt&apos;s not the masterpiece of the ages; but it&apos;s a film to enjoy once, and then, if you&apos;re into the theatrical arts at all, see again - for study."

      "reviewBody": "If you can make it through the tedious first third, it&apos;s not a bad little movie. The interplay between Arlo and Spot is generally enjoyable (the first really good scene is Spot trying to feed Arlo). The movie can be quite funny, somewhat thrilling, and occasionally touching.\n\nSo basically, if this was some kids cartoon from some lesser studio, this would be pretty good. For Pixar though, it&apos;s a big disappointment.\n\nOne of the film&apos;s biggest flaws is also one of its greatest strengths; the animation. On the one hand, the landscapes - forests, rivers, fields - have an amazing photo-realism that mark them as an incredible achievement in animation. But this hyper-realism makes the main dinosaur breed look terrible; they are about as realistic as the cars in Cars, and it&apos;s like someone filmed a sock puppet show in the Grand Canyon. It&apos;s the thing most reviewers seem to talk about, so it&apos;s rather amazing that Pixar didn&apos;t see the problem themselves.\n\nIt&apos;s not that the dinosaurs needed to look real, but the insistence on those giant, soulful eyes made the heads misshapen, and the colors are too clean and shiny to meld with the environments. Other breeds of dinosaurs and insects have an acceptable cartooniness, but Arlo is just annoying in design, creating a constant de-immersion signal.\n\nThe story is conventional and predictable, the emotional moments feel manipulative, but still, it&apos;s not bad as kid&apos;s cartoons go. But it sure isn&apos;t what we expect from Pixar.",

      "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) Over the last 25 years, there has existed a group of senior citizens living in Northampton, Massachusetts, who refuse to let age and ill health get them down. Young@Heart is a documentary based on the lives of the current singing group of 24 senior citizens, brought to the big screen by British filmmaker, Stephen Walker, who saw their performance in London. Young@Heart is not your ordinary singing chorus, because they sing rock, punk, disco, and the average age is 81 with the oldest being 92 year old Eileen Hall. The documentary follows the group over a six-week rigorous rehearsal schedule, plus practicing at home for an upcoming sold out concert in their home town. The group has many songs in their repertoire, but Bob Cilman, the stern but sympathetic chorus director, has added several songs for the new concert. These are not easy for the group to learn such as &quot;Yes We Can,&quot; &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;I Got You or (I Feel Good)&quot;. After several weeks of practice, the group is on their way to the local jail to give a performance, when they learn that one of their members passed away the night before. It is devastating for them, but they have learned that the show must go on. They all pull together and practice even harder to get ready for their evening performance. That night, their concert is a rousing success, and ends with a standing ovation.\n\n(My Comment) This movie is for people who want to see the real thing. Several of the senior citizens in this documentary open up their lives to us. You get to know them in just a few minutes, and you know that they are good people. The songs that they sing are not from their generation, yet they are willing to try something new. The seniors believe the old saying, &quot;Use it or lose it,&quot; and that is why they love singing in the chorus. Plus with perseverance and teamwork, they have become part of a second family. I laughed, smiled, tapped my foot, and even shed a few tears during the whole movie. I saw the movie twice: The first time I liked it, and the second time, I loved it. The younger audiences may not get it, but I know the adult audience will understand and love it. Young@Heart is truly an inspirational, entertaining, heart-felt, and wonderful documentary. This is an incredible story that needed to be told. You will absolutely love Fred Knittle&apos;s rendition of Coldplay&apos;s &quot;Fix You.&quot; This is one of those sleeper movies you will hear about.

      "reviewBody": "This film is an efficient thriller from Spain.  It deals with the popular urban legend of &quot;snuff&quot; films (films which depict a real-life murder committed purely for the sake of the film).\n\nThe plot involves a young film student Angela (Ana Terrant) who is doing a thesis on cinematic violence.  To research her thesis she seeks out the most extreme violence films she can find and accidentally stumbles upon a snuff film depicting the torture and murder of a fellow student from her university.  She soon starts investigating the film.\n\nThe film is well-made and well-acted with several effective scares and twists.  It&apos;s main message is that the people who watch violent films are in some way accomplices to the violent acts that they watch.  This is an old point that has been made several times before.  It also deals with the attraction of the forbidden.  For example, in the opening scene, Angela goes to see a dead body on a railway track, partly because she has been told not to.  Just when she, and the audience, are about to see the body she is stopped.  In another scene, Angela is looking away from the snuff film but takes a quick look when she is told not to."

The movie fails on every level--it bored my wife and daughter (and it&apos;s only because I&apos;m anal about finishing movies that I sat through 95 minutes of Hell; they went to bed).\n\nThis was Walter Matthau&apos;s last movie, and it hurts to see such a premiere talent being wasted (although his toupee looks as if it could live on). Meg Ryan appears to have lost weight for Hanging Up (if that&apos;s possible) and seems to be carrying the mass of the world on her shoulders, physically dissipating in front of our eyes while wearing one paper-thin muscle shirt after another. Looking scrawny and bra-less isn&apos;t appealing to anyone.\n\nOkay, enough for the nastiness. This really is a waste of film stock. Whatever BIG messages it has about sibling rivalry and familial relationships and keeping your accident from your insurance company are lost in Keaton&apos;s attempt to play cute and/or sweet (the dog and the pill; the Iranian mom).\n\nThe movie&apos;s called Hanging Up. My suggestion is to take the phone off the hook before the opening credits."

      "reviewBody": "Each &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; deviates somewhat from the Leroux novel - with the original silent film with Lon Chaney perhaps being the exception. In the &apos;40s Nelson Eddy version, the police chief and an operatic baritone are Christine&apos;s suitors instead of Raoul (though the baritone is named Raoul) and it&apos;s hinted that the Phantom is her father. His acid in the face was the result of a misunderstanding at the music publisher&apos;s.\n\nIn this particular &quot;Phantom,&quot; from Hammer Studios, the Phantom (Herbert Lom) has an Igor-type assistant, and here Christine&apos;s suitor is the manager of the opera house (Edward de Souza). There is also a real villain, a plagiarist in the form of Lord d&apos;Arcy (Michael Gough). Most notably, it has a production of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; with music written by Edwin T. Astley that is actually very pretty and beautifully sung.\n\nEveryone does a terrific job in this - Gough is hateful as the supposed composer of the opera; de Souza is a hunk and a good romantic interest for Christine; and Heather Sears as Christine is very sweet and, like all Christines, lacking the diva quality her rival has. In this film, the rival singer is a very minor role. The dubbing of the voices is wonderful.\n\nHerbert Lom, normally a comic character in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series, is a great phantom, performed at a time when the Phantom didn&apos;t have to be better-looking than the ingénue. The Phantom is not a huge role in this film, but an effective and highly sympathetic one. He seems a little less nuts than some of them, though he&apos;s clearly not completely there.\n\nThe final scene of this film is very exciting, and the final picture very powerful and sad. This is a really excellent version with not much emphasis on the horror aspects of the Chaney film. It has good production values and is very well directed.",

      "reviewBody": "This serves as a nice companion piece to &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, but DON&apos;T compare it the masterpiece or you won&apos;t enjoy it. Also, keep in mind, this was during the beginning of WWII (obviously), so expect your typical &quot;all Japanese are evil&quot; racial stereotypes. It is upsetting to see that films like these just heightened the US&apos;s paranoia, driving us to send everyone of Japanese descent to internment camps.\n\nYou&apos;re going to really enjoy this film if you&apos;ve seen modern Pulp adventures like the Indiana Jones trilogy or Sky Captain (though don&apos;t expect to see ANY mystical/sci-fi elements involved). This has it all: a hard-boiled hero, exotic locales, constant plot twists and turns, colorful villains, and a mysterious woman.\n\nBogart, as (almost) always plays the same character he always plays. but boy, does he fit in SO well into this film. Mary Astor, while not the pretty face that she was built up to be here and in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, gives another great performance, and unlike Bogart, she was always able to give characters in a similar vein (in this case, the mysterious woman), each their own personalities. Her Alberta Marlow is not at all like &quot;schoolgirl&quot; Brigid O&apos;Shaughnessey, but (at least openly) tougher, a perfect match with Bogart during their exchanges of dialogue, while remaining to be extremely ambiguous, never making sure whether or not she&apos;s an ally or a femme fatale. When all is revealed, looking back on it things made perfect sense with her character&apos;s attitude.\n\nSydney Greenstreet adds another great villain to his own rogues gallery. Here he&apos;s a man obsessed with Japanese culture and way of life, so much that he has become apart of and accepted by &quot;the enemy&quot;. Victor Sen Young, who played a great shark grinned scumbag in &quot;The Letter&quot;, does good here, looking very happy that he at least was able to speak coherently for once in a motion picture.\n\nHuston&apos;s direction is really worth looking at, especially visually stunning during a sequence at a movie theater. Without his obvious presence and Bogart, this film would have just been another propaganda story of espionage. Sadly, when he had to leave the film for war duty, the final scenes were shot by otherwise competent (but nothing special) director Vincent Sherman. The final 15 minutes seem extremely out of place with the rest of the film, and its a shame Huston wasn&apos;t around a little bit longer to round up what could have been a quintessential piece of a feature 40&apos;s pulp movie.\n\nWorth seeing, its a film that falls short of greatness, but man is it entertaining.",

She looked like a soccer mom acting in a neighborhood production. Bad casting there. I suppose they gave her the part because she was in the Matrix series, and Star Wars.\n\nThe storyline was lame, the special effects were the same ones you&apos;ve seen over and over, the acting was mediocre at best.

      "reviewBody": "The retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is in love with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) and enjoying their normal life in two. Out of the blue, Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) meets Frank in the supermarket and tells that the Wikileaks has released the information that they had participated and know the whereabouts of the Nightshade, a portable nuclear weapon that was smuggled in pieces and hidden in Russia. Now the top agents on the world are under contract to seek them out to know where Nightshade is. \n\nThe trio travels to Paris and teams-up with the Russian Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to track down the former Russian Agent The Frog (David Thewlis) to get more information about the operation. They learn that the brilliant inventor Dr. Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) might know where the weapon is. They discover that Bailey has been interned in an asylum in London by the MI-16 for thirty-two years and the British Victoria (Helen Mirren) joins the team. They rescue Bailey and find that the nuclear device is hidden in the Kremlin. Soon the dangerous South Korean Han (Byung-hun Lee) joins the group expecting to retrieve the weapon. But the dangerous killer Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) is hunting Frank down and will not stop until he recovers the nuclear bomb. \n\n&quot;Red 2&quot; is the sequel of &quot;Red&quot; that keeps the same level of entertainment of the first movie. The plot is full of action and humor and works perfectly, supported by a stellar cast and magnificent locations. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Red 2: Aposentados e Ainda Mais Perigosos&quot; (&quot;Red 2: Retired and Still More Dangerous&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "After an &quot;experiment&quot; is accidentally released from a spaceship in a tube, it crashes on Earth where it infects a youth in the 1950s. Flash forward to the mid 1980s, and the youth is now cryogenically frozen in a university lab for study. At least until Chris Romero (Jason Lively) and J.C. Hooper (Steve Marshall) release him, and he begins infecting countless members of a small college town.\n\nDirector and writer Fred Dekker, who has had a lamentably short career as a helmer, wrote Night of the Creeps in seven days. He told himself that if he did not get to the end of the script by that self-imposed deadline, the whole thing would go into the garbage. If this is what one can come up with in such a flurry, maybe more scripts should have time limits. We should also be glad that he sold the script with a caveat: if he wasn&apos;t allowed to helm the film, he wasn&apos;t going to sell it. He&apos;s said that he didn&apos;t care if it sold or not at the time.\n\nWhy Dekker has received so little recognition and respect in the industry is difficult to say. Night of the Creeps didn&apos;t have the wide release and promotion that it deserved, especially given its $5 million budget (it&apos;s curious that TriStar didn&apos;t push more to make its money back). Both this film and Dekker&apos;s 1987 effort, The Monster Squad, are currently only available on bootleg DVDs in the U.S.\n\nNight of the Creeps is one of the better horror/comedies of the 1980s. The script is clever, paying homage to everything from 1950s sci-fi horror to the zombie craze started by George Romero to 1980s slasher films and even John Hughes. Just in case one couldn&apos;t catch the homage angle, Dekker has a lot of character and place names that are tributes to various genre directors. Dekker&apos;s dialogue is witty and memorable--there are a few classic diatribes in the film that would be worthwhile and a lot of fun to memorize. Dekker&apos;s writing is self-conscious and self-mocking, predating Scream (1996) by 10 years (there is actually a whole class of 1980s and early 1990s flicks that were doing everything Scream was credited with revolutionizing). Dekker is not afraid to be joyously silly, as with genre character actor favorite Tom Atkins&apos; response when asked if he&apos;s Detective Cameron--&quot;No, Bozo the Clown&quot;. Dekker even gives us the 1980s high school classic of the hand-cranked middle finger.\n\nBut Night of the Creeps isn&apos;t just a comedy. The serious horror aspects of Night of the Creeps are extremely well done. The film is suspenseful, the effects are good, and there is plenty of gore for fans. Dekker could have easily made an effective retro horror film--most of the first five minutes are set in the 1950s, shot in black and white, and have an authentic feel, with just a dash of tongue in its cheek. He smoothly transitions from The Blob (1958) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)-styled sci-fi (with heavy Alien (1979) touches) to early 1980s slasher material, then to a more complex and fantastic collage of zombies, slugs and detectives seeking revenge.\n\nWhile the film isn&apos;t likely to be appreciated by those who dislike mixing their horror with comedy, and especially won&apos;t be appreciated by viewers who don&apos;t even realize that it&apos;s supposed to also be a comedy, neither type is very likely to watch it in the first place--at least not for long. For those with the appropriate mindset and love of horror (it&apos;s a lot more fun if one is familiar with everything being referenced), Night of the Creeps is a gem that deserves better recognition. We should at least be able to buy it on an official DVD (and please put both endings on the disc).",

      "reviewBody": "Rarely has a foreign film of such magnitude was so eagerly anticipated in America as when the movie &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; was released in the summer of 1974. Advance publicity had done the trick. The film was based on the controversial and quite scandalous 1957 novel by the pseudonymous Emmanuelle Arsan that was banned by the French Government and the Prime Minister of France not to mention several Asian countries where the film was not seen until 20 years later. But in spite having it banned,it was a shock only to see it become France&apos;s all-time box office champ. Even to this day,and in spite the film&apos;s 30th Anniversary,Emmanuelle is considered to be among the best soft-core adult films ever made and since then it has continued to draw well long after the success of it ran here in the states,despite negative reviews from critics and equally word of mouth,is one of the true mysteries of the cinema,and a protégé of what the 1970&apos;s adult cinema was to become. For one the film was a overnight sensation,and from this film spawned a record number of 13 Emmanuelle &quot;sequel&quot; films,each starring different actresses,ranging from Emmanuelle Arsan,Laura Gemser,Holly Sampson,etc; a late-night adult cable series based on the character,not to mention several &quot;hard-core&quot; adult films based on this too that went straight to video,and to this the series has become second to James Bond as one of the longest-running series in the history of the cinema,and as of this writing the Emmanuelle series is still going strong,30 years later.\n\nBut getting back to &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; the simple formula which was from the original and was to be used again in several of sequels of the series has the type of a beautiful &quot;free-spirited&quot; woman who seeks her identity through various sexual encounters with everyone and almost everywhere and with everyone in the cast;lots of stripping and nude sunbathing,full-frontal nudity,graphic sexual content that has acts of sodomy(where there is no protection of sexually transmitted diseases) including several acts of homosexuality between the men and the women(lesbianism),incompetent males who want nothing else than a piece of a woman&apos;s flesh and to do what they want with her,and extreme close-ups of women in the throes of sexual ecstasy with heavy breathing on the soundtrack-but it is done with lush music and plush sets. Unlike the other foreign films that go by the &quot;soft-core&quot; method,the simple formula for Emmanuelle would be used again in several films including another French erotica classic,&quot;The Story Of O&quot;,the next year,1975.\n\nWas &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; a surefire moneymaker at America&apos;s reveal houses? When this film was released in 1974,the audience that were going to see this film weren&apos;t exactly popular with couples,but it was the men that were going back to see this film not once,but many times since the majority of the viewing audience were males,and their dates since the women in the audience may find this to be too shocking since it was very degrading to females. The film&apos;s distributor,Columbia Pictures-at the time was facing bankruptcy and was still smarting from one of the biggest flops with the musical disaster,the remake of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1973)-had thought enough of Emmanuelle to make it the studio&apos;s second film to be &quot;X-rated&quot;,and the first since &quot;Bob,Carol,Ted and Alice&quot;(1970) which was not very successful. Realizing that there was a major audience who wanted to sample a sex film,the studio(Columbia)wisely booked Emmanuelle into first-run theaters,making it a bona fide hit for the studio,which at the time no one particularly liked it since the French were preferring to it as &quot;a masterpiece of eroticism&quot;.\n\nThe film gave an unknown Dutch-British actress Sylvia Kristel,who was very young when this film came out and made her an overnight sensation,which made her a major movie star,who would go on to star in three more &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; films. However,Sylvia Kristel is surprisingly good in a bad film;her lack of inhibitions,particularly in several scenes in the way she dresses,has an undeniably erotic effect and from there the she really shines in her performance despite the negative reviews. To also note that Kristel(the first Emmanuelle)is one of the few actresses to make to jump from sex films to mainstream films that are rated &quot;R&quot;,&quot;PG&quot;,and &quot;G&quot;. Most recently,out of the 13 films that were made based on &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; that series to this day is still going strong.\n\nHappy 30th Anniversary-Emmanuelle!"

      "reviewBody": "As another commenter said, this is pure fantasy in a Western setting. If you&apos;re looking for the gritty realism of a Spaghetti Western or an American Western from the Peckinpah era, this is definitely not your cup of tea.\n\nFor one thing, everyone is so clean -- even the Vulture Gang, whom you&apos;d naturally expect to have less exacting standards of personal hygiene.\n\nIn many ways, these &quot;Bratwurst Westerns&quot; seem like throwbacks to an earlier style, namely, the 1930s brand of American horse opera. Except that in the Old Surehand series, the Native Americans are portrayed to an almost ridiculous degree as misunderstood Noble Savages. (Which is somewhat of an improvement over depicting them as mindless, bloodthirsty savages, but neither approach corresponds very closely to the reality.) \n\nWhat&apos;s really disconcerting about the English language dub of the film is that someone else does Stewart Granger&apos;s voice. Which is a pity, because much of Granger&apos;s charm and presence as an actor resided in that inimitable bass growl. I wonder why they couldn&apos;t get him to do his own dubbing -- I&apos;d have given this one an extra star just for that.\n\nBut it doesn&apos;t look as though the production values were skimped when it came to the costuming and props, and the cinematography is occasionally breathtaking. (If possible, you should try to catch this in letterbox format, just for the gorgeous scenery.) The action sequences come off fairly well, too, and the bad guys are appropriately villainous.\n\nOverall, I can think of many worse ways to spend an hour-and-a-half.",

      "reviewBody": "In a year overwhelmed with reminiscent films, Elizabeth rises above the rest to become one of few stunning manifestations of the Hollywood Renaissance. Certainly acknowledged by the Oscars garnering 7 nominations, Shekhar Kapur&apos;s intimate portrait of a young Elizabeth further expands the modern view on a distant monarch, whose maturing reign as well as taming nature continued to dazzle the 20th century viewers.\n\nPresented here by a superb cast led by Golden-Globe winner Cate Blanchett, early Elizabethean era turmoil and upheaval are captured brilliantly. The lush set itself is a feast for the eye as the audience is drawn to follow a passionate young Elizabeth&apos;s path. Against the dark setting of medieval stone castles, a blooming Golden Age approaches as England expands to take control in a world of great unrest after Catholic Queen Mary&apos;s death. Her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth daughter of Anne Bolyne is placed on a throne of a kingdom torn between religion. Cate Blanchett does a fabulous job capturing the details of a frustrated young woman waking to the merciless reality of queenhood--surrounded by enemies such as Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Constantly by her side is her reverent adviser Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) who advises Elizabeth to marry for convenience choosing from a &quot;pool&quot; of ready political candidates--while Elizabeth herself is long set on her lover from the past Sir Robert Dudley (a charming Joseph Fiennes). Yet just as England learns to wake up from the medieval dream, Elizabeth learns the bitterness of betrayal as she looks to Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush)&apos;s counsel.\n\nFocusing on Elizabeth&apos;s subtle changes of phase from fire to ice at a distant in the midst of a grander panorama beautifully shot, the audience gradually distinguishes her footsteps from the shedding of innocence to a tough ruler that dares to strike first against her enemies, to ultimately become the Virgin Queen to reign above all men."

      "reviewBody": "An okay Western based loosely on fact. Viewers tuning in today are likely catching up with Hudson&apos;s first starring role, following several years in supporting parts. Now, when I think Western, I&apos;ve got to admit Hudson doesn&apos;t spring first to mind. Nonetheless, whatever he lacks in frontier grit, he makes up for in energetic commitment. I also suspect that he and Adams are the best-looking twosome to appear in any oater, any time any place. In fact, Adams sports the sleekest array of supposed frontier fashion that I&apos;ve seen.\n\nThe story itself is unexceptional and cheaply produced, never getting beyond LA area locations. Indeed, this may be the only Western where the indoors is more compelling to look at than the outdoors. The movie does come up with a bunch of up-and-coming supporting players, like Van Cleef, Weaver, Ansara—too bad they don&apos;t get more screen time. Then too, McIntire&apos;s unusual dual role, both with Old Testament beards, had me confused until I consulted IMDb. I expect there&apos;s a backstory to this duplicate casting. \n\nProducer Alland went from here to producing some of the most entertaining sci-fi of the decade— e.g. It Came from Outer Space (1953), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). I&apos;m just sorry he didn&apos;t insist here on sticking with the original ending (thanks, reviewer bkoganbing). A happy ending may have pleased audiences of the time, but the original would have been more memorable."

Fortunately, for movie audiences around the world, his talent for acting on the big screen has superseded and today he is known as one of the finest thespians in show business. Take this film for instance, it&apos;s called &quot; Gun Shy. &quot; In this story, he plays Charles &apos;Charlie&apos; Mayeaux (pronounced - MAYO) a field operative working for the D.E.A. His job is to take on the big drug cartels and put them out of business. However, a bad experience in his last encounter with the drug lords, got him so shook up, it left him with a confidence problem, which has created a noticeable fear of death. So much so, he has begun seeing a therapist. In the meantime, his job continues and he must go undercover to confront the Columbia drug cartel and the America mafia, which could get him killed. Oliver Platt, is a gangster with anger management issues, José Zúñiga and Michael DeLorenzo play Columbian operatives out for the big score or big hit, whichever comes first. If that were not enough, Charlie must also attend Group therapy with Richard Schiff and other problem oriented patients. Mitch Pileggi, interestingly plays Dexter Helvenshaw a corrupt agent. Although there are several parts of the film which exercise Neeson&apos;s great gifts for interaction, most of the movie scenes are hampered with too many issues and little cohesion and this makes for awkward moments. Still, it&apos;s a good and interesting film and one which makes for entertainment and isn&apos;t that what movie making is all about? ***",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen CROSSROADS so many times I&apos;ve lost count. And, it won&apos;t be the last time I&apos;ll watch it. The music alone would be reason enough. But, this film is far deeper. And no amount of exposition about it could ever *SPOIL* it for the virgin-viewer who has never seen it.\n\nEugene Martone, considered a prodigy on the classical guitar, is a young Long Island man attending the prestigious Julliard Music School. Problem? He prefers the blues over classical. And he&apos;s on a quest. He uncovers evidence that blues guitar legend, Robert Johnson, composed 30 songs. Since only 29 were ever recorded, he becomes obsessed at finding the &apos;lost&apos; song number 30 (and being the first person to record it). And, after some sleuthing, he finds an old photograph and a news clipping -- pointing him toward the only living person who would know that song and who, fortunately, lives nearby. His name is Willie Brown (aka Blind Dog Fulton, aka Smokehouse Brown), a friend of Robert Johnson who traveled and performed with him (harmonica/vocals). Brown lives in a penal facility for old people (a criminal&apos;s nursing home). At first, Brown denies his true identity. But confronted with a photo of himself next to Robert Johnson, Brown finally admits the truth. And, he agrees to teach Martone the lost song -- but ONLY if Martone breaks him out of the facility and takes him back to Mississippi.\n\nThe catch? Martone knows that lore surrounding Robert Johnson says he sold his soul to the Devil. What he doesn&apos;t know is that it&apos;s fact, not lore ... and that Willie Brown did the same thing. And Martone doesn&apos;t know that Brown&apos;s reason for going back to Mississippi is to return to the &apos;crossroads&apos; where he and Johnson sold their souls in hopes of getting the Devil to release him from his contract. This culminates in an eerie finale where Martone gambles his soul in a blues duel with the Devil&apos;s own guitarist, Jack Butler ... to save Brown from eternal damnation.\n\nDirector Walter Hill is masterful, combining music, drama, alternate history, fantasy, and horror into a single plot. Kudos must also be given to screenwriter John Fusco for giving Hill a masterful script to work from. But contrary to most people, my favorite scene isn&apos;t the blues duel. It&apos;s the scene where Martone wakes up to find out a girl he met in his travels with Brown (and had a romantic interest in) has unexpectedly left them to go her own way. And immediately after that, Brown admits he lied... that there never was a song number 30. At that moment, Martone, who&apos;d been merely a good blues &apos;player&apos; up to that point picks up his guitar and begins to play a sad blues song ... one certainly coming from his soul, not from his memory of what others have played. It is that momentary &apos;graduation&apos; scene (the transition between blues &apos;player&apos; and blues &apos;man&apos;) that sets the stage for the duel ... with film watchers knowing Martone is as ready for it as he can be.",

The film is packed with action, adventure, love and romance, and some humour!! It has a great script and is directed well, and boasts an exceptional cast, it&apos;s not your average post war film, but has many memorable moments. There is a great section to look out for where the &quot;prince&quot; visits his troops, I won&apos;t give away what happens, but you may see that the &quot;prince&quot; is based on what Prince William (England) would look like in the not so distant future!!! anyway, I recommend this film, and I think you will all enjoy it!!"

When leaves the area, a stranger arrives and gently brushes dirt off the face of a dead girl. Silently, he begins to bury them. Another stranger turns up and together the bury the corpses to the haunting, melancholic tune of Ennio Morricone&apos;s soundtrack. What follows is a...comedy?\n\nThis is the most bi-polar Western I&apos;ve ever seen. Morricone&apos;s soundtrack is heart wrenching and beautiful. The gunfights are violent. Women are beaten and tortured, and yet, in between all this, there&apos;s slapstick and one liners. Mood swings?\n\nOne stranger is Giuliano Gemma and he&apos;s the guy on the run from the psycho. The other guy is Mario Adorf and he&apos;s a miner with a bit of gold but not a lot of brains. Gemma is at first out to con Adorf which does over and over again, but then Adorf is so kind and big hearted the two of them just bond. However, there&apos;s still that crazy guy and is family to worry about.\n\nIt&apos;s kind of a road movie as the two characters head for Adorf&apos;s ranch and encounter various characters, like the fake Mermaid lady or the bank robbers. None of it should work but it all kind of does anyway as the man behind the camera is the guy who made Death Rides A Horse. Kind of weird to take though as people are still gunned down brutally ala a Spaghetti Western from 1968, but has huge bar fights and punch ups like a 1972 Spaghetti Western.\n\nI was curious to watch it as I&apos;d never seen Mario Adorf in a Spaghetti Western before. He does well as the slow miner guy. Gemma is the usual goofy charmer and a ladies man.",

A pretty solid entry into the war movie genre, it also might feel a bit dated to a few people. The acting is pretty decent and you have a very enticing story that you can follow, connected to 5 characters.\n\nDon&apos;t expect there to be too much action though. It is more story driven if you will and you shouldn&apos;t expect too much of the action either. But that shouldn&apos;t be the main criteria that you judge the movie for. Hopefully it isn&apos;t because you probably wouldn&apos;t like it all then. But if you let yourself into that time and into the movie, then you can enjoy as much as most people who voted for it did",

The pair play out the master/slave dynamic with nasty commitment.  Its not merely S&amp;M however, its positively psychopathic in a nasty but  sickly playful sense.  Its a dark little vision of police power abused and quite probably all too real for  some viewers and protestors out there who realise the strong arm of the law isn&apos;t disembodied from the bodies of individual policeman despite  political rhetoric to the contrary. But hey, this isn&apos;t all that serious a movie. Keitel is great, Lydon is a vicious  victim and it all goes by relatively quickly.  John Lydon is worth the price of admission/rental/purchase alone.  Enjoyably twisted."

      "reviewBody": "New Moon (1940 MGM) starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is by far the best movie these two super star operetta singers provided for the USA and world public in the years before World War II during the Golden Age Of Hollywood.\n\nIt is one of the last and best of the black and white movie costume musicals, and is dazzling in every way. Every film buff should obtain and screen this incredible movie often.\n\nThe two stars, Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, appeared in two widely and justifiably honored movies before this one......Naughty Marietta (1935 MGM) and also Rosemarie (1937 MGM), and were incredible in both.\n\nThey managed to turn the unusual trick of skillful acting combined with singing music in the range and with the obvious ability of true opera stars (Nelson Eddy later provided wonderful singing of famous opera arias in &quot;The Whale Who Wanted To Sing At The Met&quot; sequence part of the Make Mine Music [1946 Disney] animated cartoon show.)\n\nIn addition to wonderful singing, MacDonald and Eddy provide actor performances comfortable and delightful to watch, the kind of acting people from all backgrounds could feel comfortable with and enjoy. They were natural actors of high talents and also singers of unparalleled gifts. The entire history of world cinema never saw their equal before or since.\n\nThe chemistry between MacDonald and Eddy is breathtaking....at times understated and amazingly carefree considering the pomp and glamor always part of their costumed and sumptuously decorated surroundings, and at times intimate to a level of sexual believability almost &quot;x&quot; rated. but it never occurred to the censors to object to their movies or performances or for the public, even the most conservative part of it, to object to the acting and love duet singing these two super stars provided. They were in a class by themselves, never to be forgotten, always to be cherished, probably never to be duplicated at any time in the future.....they were to musical performing arts what Shakespeare was to dramatic play writing....the best of the best.\n\nThe camera work includes many night time scenes and moving scenes tracking marching men, galloping horses, and sumptuous dances and walks in formal gardens in New Orleans mansions part of it all. So, too, are wonderful special effects sequences showing a storm at sea which wrecks the large sailing ship which takes the main characters away from New Orleans, deposits them on a lonely island, and is wrecked by a storm which somehow does not drown or harm the endangered boat passengers.\n\nSomehow, it is all believable, and one can never take one&apos;s eyes off of the screen, or stop being interested and believing in the story, rooting for the main characters as they face and overcome one travail after the other.\n\nNew Moon (1940 MGM) starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is the sort of movie one knows will end happily from the start, and no matter what the characters face, the audience knows it will all come out all right in the end, and a splendid and enjoyable story is always ahead, well presented and scripted, witty and charming, wonderfully costumed, supplied with one beautifully furnished and designed setting after another....the sort of movie which could and was only provided for American and world audiences during the fabled Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood in the years immediately before World War II, perhaps the high water mark in movie history.\n\nSee this movie and these two actors (and the other two movies of fame they did before this....Naughty Marietta [1935 MGM] and Rosemarie [1937 MGM]}. Everything about it is good in all ways\n\n------------------\n\nWritten by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor.

Unfortunately, &quot;Feast of Love&quot; is such a complete and shallow mess from start to finish you almost don&apos;t care how well performed it is. The film attempts to be so deep and meaningful that nearly every scene, scenario and line of dialogue are simply ridiculous. It tries too hard and achieves very little. I can&apos;t comment on Charles Baxter&apos;s original novel, but I think it&apos;s safe to say that Robert Benton (director), Allison Burnett (screenwriter) and Andrew Mondshein (film editor) conspired to make the most incoherent mess they possibly could. Cut this feature to an hour running time including commercials and throw it on USA Network or Lifetime, because it doesn&apos;t cut it as a film. This is a prime example of poor film-making and storytelling that just wastes some truly great performances by a very dynamic and talented cast."

A young teenage girl coming of age in of all places, Beverly Hills. The lead character, &quot;Cher&quot; played brilliantly by Alicia Silverstone, is a self centered high school girl in the beginning of the picture who&apos;s only interests include clothes, cars and credit cards. As the film progresses, she begins to mature and actually begins to care about other people, not to mention her environment. It&apos;s worth renting anytime. Just like &quot;European Vacation&quot; it doesn&apos;t matter how many times you see it, it still makes you laugh and that&apos;s worth it all."

      "reviewBody": "First of all I very much liked this film. It&apos;s alway lovely to watch two symmetrically perfect human beings enjoy each other and allow us to watch. Kristen Stewart is an underrated actress with the potential of great things and I hope to enjoy her more. Nicholas Hoult is a beautiful man and a very good actor who is developing well. This film is, however, an incredible rip off of George Lucas&apos; first film, THX 1138. How the film makers weren&apos;t sued I don&apos;t know. The near future is blandly gorgeous with &quot;clean&quot; humans whose only dread is obsolescence by way of our frailty as emotional, thoughtful creatures.. This has been bred out of us however genetics is a persistent and ever evolving pesky little demon which has weakened our ability to resist the aforementioned weakness of emotions. We witness two intelligent but remorselessly bland individuals slowly realize that they are inflected with emotion. Unfortunately those that can not fight it are doomed to the DEN where they are ruthlessly tortured and persuaded to kill themselves. Both Hoult, &quot;Silas&quot; and Stewart &quot;Nia&quot; fall in love and the plot then revolves on them getting away with it and getting away. There is good supporting drama from Guy Pierce and the wonderful Jacki Weaver but I am haunted by the future always being shades of grey with the only hope being that of escape. I loved THX 1138 when I was a very young film lover and I remember it. Which is why I liked Equals. I only hope it was meant as a homage. However I don&apos;t think I will remember it.",

      "reviewBody": "This film can only be misjudged these days. &quot;Live Wire&quot; comes from a time when coming up with the most showy ideas and putting into a movie were something fun for our eyes to see and for audiences enjoy it as if it was the coolest thing ever created. And it has Pierce Brosnan a little before Bond, already showing up some skills when it comes to be a great action hero and a sexy ladies man.\n\nHe plays Danny O&apos;Neill, a bomb disposal expert with lots of trouble to deal (which includes the alleged love affair his wife is having with a Senator) when a maniac (Ben Cross) decides to eliminate political targets by using a liquid explosive that is practically invisible to eyes. And one of the targets is...the Senator (played by Ron Silver). I haven&apos;t said much but I guess you already can form scenes, situations, establish connections and see how this is going to end. Ridiculously predictable to make you feel sick.\n\nThe biggest achievement of &quot;Live Wire&quot; is seeing the use of the invisible explosive that is easily ingested and later causes a lot of damages and deaths. It doesn&apos;t end without some shock, very similar to a heart-attack, then the eyes start to get read and boom! The courtroom scene is terrifying, just to give an example. \n\nIt&apos;s fun to watch. The cast is good, they are suitable and comfortable in their roles and they save the script of being a whole mess. Speaking of the script, this had one of the worst plot holes ever presented on screen that even a kid can easily detect: the fighting between Danny and Tony Plana&apos;s character in the fountain scene. How come such writer comes up in developing such a tense moment with these two fighting, alternately drowning each other in the explosive water but only one pays the price and blow up to pieces? How does one expect to get away with this? \n\nWith all those obstacles this manages to be thrilling, funny (specially the robot trained to find bombs who has a crush on Brosnan&apos;s character or the whole city knowing about the infidelities of his wife) and there&apos;s reasonable action sequences. Highpoint of the movie: the duel in the house where Pierce has the chance to demonstrate he knows everything about bombs, improvising explosive devices to kill the bad guys. \n\nGoofy, relatively dumb but who cares, this is good. Don&apos;t take it too seriously and you&apos;ll see what&apos;s so good about it. 7/10",

A fairly descent and slightly more believable plot then the recent James Bond movies. Lundgren somewhat performs much better than his other features. It&apos;s fun to see Montel in this type of role. Keep an eye out on the dramatic Bruckheimer-like ending sequence, they pulled it off quite well.\n\nOther than that, its definitely worth a watch if you&apos;re a fan of action movies, B movies, or Lundgren."

      "name": "Very funny - but the real strength of the film is being able to relate to the characters",
      "reviewBody": "Our story begins when a male nurse named Greg Focker (Stiller) is about to propose to his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo); unfortunately, things come to worst and before Greg can say, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; he finds out that Pam&apos;s father, Jack (Robert De Niro) approved of Pam&apos;s sister&apos;s fiancé because he asked Jack&apos;s permission to marry her first. Taken aback, Greg decides to wait until tomorrow, whence they are going to meet Pam&apos;s parents, and ask Jack for approval before proposing to Pam. Should be a piece of cake, right? Wrong. Pam&apos;s mother (Blythe Danner) is very nice, but herein lies the problem: Not only is it apparent from the start that Pam&apos;s plant-expert father is not really a plant-expert (as Greg learns after Jack doesn&apos;t seem to recognize a plant Greg gives to him--one of the rarest plants in the world), but it turns out Jack is really in the CIA and was a &quot;human lie detector,&quot; as Pam herself puts it. In fact, Jack even gives Greg a lie detector test in one scene to see if he liked the dinner earlier in the evening. &quot;Yes,&quot; Greg replies, to see the needle jumping. &quot;Well, it was a little rare for my tastes, maybe.&quot; Greg, desperately seeking approval (and nervous as ever), seems to unintentionally cause mayhem in his possible parents-to-be&apos;s home. Nerves shot like a drug addict, Greg is the definition of a nervous wreck, and all his problems seem to escalate more and more until a funny-if-sappy comedic showdown.\n\nYou know how sometimes you are really nervous, but try to hide the fact? You seem to keep your cool, until you do something, then all your nervousness explodes and you start knocking over things, saying stupid things--single-handedly DOING stupid things that you just never do? And then you look around and everyone is looking at you like you are some sort of freak? Well, that&apos;s how it is with Greg&apos;s character in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;--he is so easy to identify with. Just like all of us, we want to keep our cool and impress people--but once we lose it, the coolness seems to slip farther and farther away from our grip until we are klutzes on feet. For Greg&apos;s character, small things turn bigger and bigger and bigger--from knocking over the remains of Jack&apos;s mother (and having a cat go to the bathroom on the remains), to setting the house on fire and busting the septic tank. Situations seem to escalate farther and farther out of control and they just keep getting worse and worse.\n\nIn one scene, Greg tries to impress everyone while playing volleyball in a pool. His team is losing because of him. &quot;Get up and hit the ball,&quot; Jack says to him. So the next time the ball comes around to Greg, he jumps up and smacks the ball with all his might, sending it flying towards...Pam&apos;s sister (whose wedding is the next day), shattering her nose. Greg lands back in the pool and seems to be happy, until he realizes he smacked his sister-in-law-to-be in the nose. Then everyone looks at him like he&apos;s an insensitive idiot.\n\nThings like that have happened to me countless times, and that is why I can so easily identify with Greg. People are yelling at Greg to do something, and when he finally does it, it backfires and everyone looks at him like he&apos;s stupid, even though he did exactly what he was told.\n\nThat&apos;s the kind of thing that makes this movie so great--not only is it extremely funny, but we can easily identify with the main character countless times throughout the film. That is, perhaps, the best thing about this comedy.",

      "reviewBody": "I always have enjoyed the Carry On movies, they are a lot of fun and there are some very talented actors in the series. There are some stinkers like England, Emmanuelle and Columbus sure, but there are gems like Screaming(my personal favourite, Cleo, Up the Khyber and Camping. Don&apos;t Lose Your Head is up there with the best entries of the series. For me it wasn&apos;t perfect, Jim Dale is wasted and Jacqueline&apos;s harp scene is cringe-worthy. However, it is tightly directed, never dull and is beautifully designed. The music is also suitably rousing, and while simple the story spoofs The Scarlet Pimpernel in a very sharp and hilarious manner. The writing and the cast though were what made Don&apos;t Lose Your Head as good as it was. Right from the names, brilliant comic incidents and entendres the gags are plentiful and the memorable quotes endless, it is really a very wittily and hilariously written film. The bloody sight exchange is a scream in particular. Sidney James is superb(even when camping it up he still manages to make for a dashing fop), of the Carry On series I think he has only been better in Khyber. Kenneth Williams steals every scene and possibly even the entire film, his comic timing is spot on and it is worth seeing him for his facial expressions alone. Charles Hawtrey has some great lines and delivers them with utter comic conviction, while Joan Sims also excels as a very aptly-named character. Overall, very good and one of the best of an entertaining series. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

It should be said there are some lapses, particularly in the dialogue, which is often unnecessarily repeated.  And sometimes, in his attempt not to play on our emotions too much, Sheridan goes too far in the opposite direction, making the film too distant.\n\nStill, this is a powerful film.  Sheridan was accused with IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER with making an anti-British film, but in that one and this one, he shows he&apos;s not afraid of taking on his own people as well.  At the same time, while his sympathies are with Day-Lewis&apos; character, he&apos;s able to recognize all sides of the situation, as to emphasize the point that peace is always hard work.  Day-Lewis, as usual, gives an outstanding performance, though he&apos;s a little too old, and Watson continues to grow as an actress with her performance.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a blandoid tale of the famous inscrutable detective Charlie Chan (Sir Peter Ustinov) , this time he is called out of retirement to help a San Francisco police inspector (Brian Keith) to solve a mysterious series of murders. As Detective Charlie Chan helps resolve the many bizarre murders and along the way confronts his old nemesis , the Dragon Queen (Angie Dickinson) , who is the prime suspect , and, ultimately , reveals the true identity of the murderer . His clumsy grandson Lee (recently deceased Richard Hatch) , who&apos;s getting married , (to Michelle Pfeiffer) &quot;helps&quot; , while has something to do with convoluted family shenanigans . The premise is the following one : whether the Dragon Queen behind these grisly killings or other supect criminals are involved into the slaughters are happening in San Francisco ¿. .Murderer force victim to eat 10,000 goldfish . First time fish stuff man. Murderer who turn victim into human baked potato have real appetite for crime.\n\nFun but average and excessively silly comedy dealing with the adventures of Charlie Chan while is investigating a twisted criminal case . Here all roles result to be bungling , idiot or daft , as Chan has an adoring botcher half-Jewish as grandson who in turn has an adoring halfwit doll of a girlfriend . As Charlie Chan/Peter Ustinov is accompanied by his bumbling grandson Lee Chan, Jr. : Richard Hatch as his sidekick , who is about to marry Michelle Pfeiffer , along with the hysterical , shouting grandmother : Lee Grant , and an eccentric maid : Rachel Roberts and the sympathetic wheelchair-bound Roddy MacDowall , too . It packs farce , noisy action with diverting chase sequences , humor , slapstick , slapdash , amusement , entertainment , several scenes with no much sense and one-lines all fall mirthlessly through the bottomless script . It was a whole mess with staggering cost approx 9 million dollars.\n\nHowever , it contains a moving and lively musical score by Patrick Williams . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Paul Mohlann . The motion picture was regularly directed by Clive Donner . He was a good craftsman who usually directed for TV , such as : Charlemagne, le prince à cheval , Merlín and the sword , The Scarlet Pimpernel , To Catch a King Dead , Adventures of thief of Baghdad, Man&apos;s Folly , Rogue Male , Spectre , Francis Drake , Oliver Twist , Christmas Carol and occassionally for cinema , such as : Stealing Heaven , Some People , Nothing But the Best , The Sinister Man , Marriage of convenience ,Heart of a Child , The Nude Bomb , Vampira , The caretaker ,Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush , Alfred the Great and his greatest hit : What&apos;s New Pussycat.\n\nThere are various renditions about detective Charlie Chan , these are the following ones : Charlie Chan in Paris 1935 by Lewis Seiler with Warner Oland , Mary Brian . Charlie&apos;s Chan&apos;s secret 1935 by Gordon Wiles with Warner Oland , Charles Quigley . Charlie Chan at the opera 1936 directed by Bruce Humberstone with Warner Oland . Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum 1940 by Lynn Shore with Sydney Toler . Charlie Chan in Rio 1941 by Harry Lachman with Sidney Toler , Mary Beth Hughs , Victor Jory . Charlie Chan and the secret service 1944 by Phil Rosen with Sidney Toler , Moreland , Arthur Loft . Rating : 5.5/10 . Mediocre but with some funny moments .",

Anthony Wong is his buddy who gets CYF to rescue him from a loan shark which escalates to more trouble with Wong betraying him also. Simon Yam is Wong &apos;s cousin and a ruthless and sleazy gangster . He also is gay and is attracted to CYF. CYF is betrayed and left for dead and an innocent family is killed and a young girl is badly burned and disfigured as well. Anthony Wong steals CYF &apos;s woman and continues to work with his cousin &apos;s gang. CYF then resurfaces to get even and bring street justice . Full Contact is a unique take on the heroic bloodshed genre brought to life with HK&apos;s A list cast and director . Classic.",

      "reviewBody": "... And boy is it soft \n\nI saw this on cable channel Bravo one Saturday night and here in Britain we often have these dire &quot; Erotic &quot; soft core movies turning up late at night on Bravo . This one follows a WEIRD SCIENCE type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies .  \n\nWhen you`ve seen one of these movies you`ve seen them all with a bunch of bimbos looking like they`re advertising silicone implants . Come on I`ve actually seen breasts in real life ( I`m sure some other of us have too ) and they wobble around unlike here where they defy the laws of , if not physics than at least gravity . The sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well buffed geezer rubs himself against his co-star without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they climax it looks like they`re both having a bad attack of constipation . The girls themselves are very pretty especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz but they`re wasted in these type of soft core movies \n\nAnd if it`s fantasy you`re after I recommend the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy",

Anyone who enjoyed Toys or Bandits will probably enjoy this film.\n\nSure its not the greatest, but I do believe it is worth watching. Even from a directing standpoint its a pretty decent film.\n\nThe two main characters, Jack Black (Nick Vanderpark) and Ben Stiller (Tim Dingman) play complete opposites. From the first moment of the film you begin to see the differences between their lives. I found all of these little differences entertaining to watch.\n\nDon&apos;t believe the reviews or what others are saying....go see it for yourself and find out.\n\n6.5 out of 10",

To compare it to his earlier movies would be unfair as he makes much smaller budget movies these days. First off if you are a veteran of Seagal films of the last ten or so years you can tell if he cares about the movie or not and he certainly seems to be putting a bit of effort into this one. No body doubles of bad dubbing in this which is good. The story is very generic, a basic revenge movie. Not unlike the movies Charles Bronson made when he was a similar age to Seagal now. The action scenes are well done with some good shoot outs and fist and knife fights. The acting is a little hit and miss although the bad guy who will be familiar to people who seen the awful Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull was very good. So worth a rent on a Friday night but i really wish Hollywood would give Seagal another big budget action movie. Hell lets get another Under Siege movie out before its too late.",

      "reviewBody": "Peter Maffay is not the guy you expect to see in a hard-boiled detective revenge movie. The Romanian-born greasy ballad singer with a certain pseudo-rock and macho image who is a big music star in Germany for 35 years now tried a step into the movies with this German crime movie from 1987.\n\nMaffay plays Jan Bogdan, a police detective in Hamburg who becomes seriously hurt during a bomb attack in a restaurant by a brutal killer gang. His good friend has been killed, and Bogdan is bound to the wheelchair now. Filled with anger and thirst for revenge he quits the police and kills his opponents one by one until he finds the heads of the gang... of course there&apos;s a good buddy involved, too, and a well-looking dark-haired seduction that both guys are falling in love with, some corrupt policemen, conspiracies, brutal henchmen with black gloves, assassinations, killings, showdowns etc.\n\nThe direction of crime movie veteran Peter Patzak is well done, but shows some boring lengths in the middle of the plot. The script combines elements of seventies crime action with hard-boiled detective stories, revenge dramas, Italian giallos and mafia movies and of course a lot of bad 80&apos;s hard rock ballads... the cast is fine with Tahnee Welch as the sexy girlfriend and first class actors like Armin Mueller-Stahl, Michael York and Elliot Gould (all of them playing bad guys here).\n\nOnly the choice of Peter Maffay was a big misstep, as his range of acting is limited to the face expressions of a goldfish. Bearing his never changing forced macho style all the time and especially listening to his bad way of stumbling his dialogues together is a pure pain in the ass! Fortunately for movie-goes, Maffay returned only once again on the screens - except for some cameos - in the cliche-ladden adventure drama &quot;Verschollen im Jemen&quot; (Missing in Yemen) in 1999, directed by Patzak, too.\n\nSome more details for movie buffs - the bad soundtrack, consisting of greasy digital keyboard tunes and bad 80&apos;s &quot;Scorpions&quot; style hard rock ballads, was composed by Maffay and former Rainbow keyboard player Tony Carey who had a short musical career in Germany 20 years ago. Production assistant Otto Retzer later became the director of the cheesy soap opera &quot;Ein Schloss am Woerthersee&quot; and several b-movie adventures such as the strange &quot;Der schwarze Fluch&quot;. A nice movie for Maffay worshippers, but not the big jewel to discover for crime genre and film retro fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Half Past Dead 2.\n\nThink about that for a moment. Does that mean, &quot;Half Past Dead, As Well&quot; or &quot;Two Individuals who are Both Half Past Dead in equal measure&quot; or, &quot;3 Times as Dead as the Average Corpse&quot;? I don&apos;t know, but logic was never the strong suit of this wouldbe prison riot franchise. \n\nWhen the first Half Past Dead came out Steven Seagal wasn&apos;t the joke he is today. He was simply box office poison. The movie grossed 15 million dollars and quietly ended the theatrical career of Seagal. Since then, Seagal has gone on to star in about a dozen direct-to-video actioners. Oddly however, he is not in this sequel. \n\nInstead, we get rapper Kurupt returning as the whiny wise guy, &quot;Twitch&quot; and new-comer Bill Goldberg as a framed felon with a heart of gold. Continuing the series&apos; standard of actor/directors Art Camacho takes over from Don Michael Paul as director of the shenanigans. \n\nInstead of just resetting the series and using the name and general premise (annoying B-level rapper sidekick and innocent white ass kicker) as a selling point, Half Past Dead 2 legitimizes its&apos; existence by continuing the plot of the first film which centered around $200 million in missing gold. Twitch knows where said gold is, as does another prisoner who is to be paroled before Twitch. Twitch does the only logical thing, picks a prison fight and gets sent to a prison closer to the gold&apos;s locationobviously. \n\nTwitch plans to break out of prison. But before anything happens, a riot breaks out while Goldberg&apos;s daughter and Twitches fiancé are visiting. Mayhem ensues. \n\nIt&apos;s almost needless to say, but Half Past Dead 2 is not a very good movie. There are massive logic jumps. The main plot is predicated on the assumption that a man can yell a name in a crowed room, pull out a gun and shoot someone, and then frame another man for the crime. The rest of the movie feels oddly reminiscent of Lets Go to Prison.\n\nAlso, Kurupt&apos;s Twitch, the film&apos;s main protagonist, is more annoying than he clever. His motivations are not always clear, and Goldberg&apos;s performance could not be flatter if the film were animated \n\nStill, the film is oddly watchable. Thanks to Camacho&apos;s energetic direction that makes the most of the film&apos;s obviously microscopic budget, and some solid (for the genre) performances from the bit players.\n\nAnd then there is the guy who has his face tattooed right below his face on his neck. Yeah, it&apos;s that kind of movie. Whereas recent big budget fair like Grindhouse tried to imitate this kind of film, Half Past Dead 2 is a real entry into the genre of schlocky B-grade ultra-violent grindhouse fair. While it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to the inspired brutality of say, Sonny Chiba&apos;s The Streetfighter, or the out and out lunacy of Roger Corman&apos;s Death Race 2000, Half Past Dead 2 does hold its&apos; own. It&apos;s not great, but it&apos;s definitely better than the original and nothing painful to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "There seems to be two entrenched sides to the debate about this film and I must come down firmly in the middle. I love all the Pink Panther films. The later ones for their genius slapstick, comic set pieces and one-liners and the first two, The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, for their more subtle comedy and character development. These early two films are both romantic comedies and work brilliantly as such (by the way, has anyone ever seen the 1968 film, Inspector Clouseau, starring Alan Arkin?).\n\nThe real point about The Pink Panther is that the Inspector Clouseau character was supposed to be another in the line of Peter Sellers cameos in US films of the time. It was a David Niven film. It was during the shooting that Sellers, realising that he had a chance to make a real name for himself in America, set out to steal every scene, take-after-take. His part was continuously enlarged as a result (much to the alleged chagrin of Niven).\n\nIt is only looking back, in the light of the films that followed, that The Pink Panther seems a somewhat lesser comedy than the others.\n\n This is a beautifully over-the-top sixties film. Stylistically it&apos;s very dated but a gem to watch, especially when you know that Peter Sellers was trying so hard to make an impact. I urge those of you who love the Pink Panther movies but are disappointed by this one to watch it again, armed with this knowledge, and appreciate the genius at work."

      "reviewBody": "If you told me five years ago that I&apos;d be watching a movie about a mouse who is adopted by humans, I&apos;d probably ask you what kind of drugs you were taking and how many would I need to take to enjoy such puerile piffle. But five years ago we didn&apos;t have the kind of technical wizardry we have now; witness Toy Story, the new Star Wars, or any of the recent Disney films. Five years ago, the mouse would have been a regular rodent with a not-too-subtle voiceover. Remember Homeward Bound, the movie about the two dogs and the cat? There was no computer animation there, and you were basically left with three animals who appeared to cavort onscreen while some humans talked in the background. \n\nSo now here we have Stuart Little, a tiny little mouse (voiced by the always-fresh Michael J. Fox) who has lived his entire life in an orphanage. One day, the Littles (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) come to the orphanage looking for a brother for their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki). Of course, with so many cute little boys and girls, it&apos;s impossible to choose - until they come across Stuart, who seems smart, funny, and wise beyond his years. George isn&apos;t too fond of Stuart at the start - he expected something a little... um, taller - but this is a kids&apos; movie, after all, so eventually they bond as only a boy and his mouse brother can - by winning a boat race against a nasty bully.\n\nThere are a few storylines jammed into this 85-minute extravaganza. Stuart wants to learn about his natural parents, the family cat wants to kill him, and the parents want Stuart and George to get along. The way most of it plays out will come off as standard movie fare - predictable to those of us over 10, perhaps - but the winning charm of Fox as the loveable Stuart coupled with an engaging and appealing cast of characters makes up for any familiarity you might feel. On top of it all - the special effects. Now, I&apos;m not one to heap overweening praise on special effects, but at no point during the viewing of this movie did I consider Stuart (or the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane) to be an artificial computer creation. Sure, you have to suspend belief a little bit for this movie, but hey - don&apos;t you have to do that with almost any movie, anyway?",

And a good one.\n\nAnn Eleonora Joergensen plays a priest in a women prison. She meets Kate (Trine Dyrholm) who can perform miracles, which means she can make people fresh from drug overdoses. But Kate has a dark secret. She left her child to die from thirst, when she was going on drugs herself.\n\nThere are many conflicts here and the tough one is the priest getting pregnant, but the child might be mongoloid. How about abortion? How can she deal with that, when she deals with mothers at prison, who has murdered their children. \n\nMuch to think about and much to feel about also, in this quite good Anette K Olesen movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The female of the species goes jungle red in tooth and claw in this brilliant screen adaptation of Claire Boothe Luce&apos;s famous Broadway play--a wickedly funny portrait of 1930s society women whose lives revolve around beauty treatments, luncheons, fashion shows, and each other&apos;s men. Socialite Mary Haines is the envy of her set: rich, beautiful, and happily married... but when her husband steps out on her with a gold-digging perfume counter sales clerk, Mary&apos;s so-called friends dish enough dirt to make divorce inevitable whether Mary wants it or not.\n\nThe script is wickedly, mercilessly funny, fast paced, razor sharp and filled with such memorable invective that you&apos;ll be quoting it for weeks and months afterward: &quot;He says he&apos;d like to do Sylvia&apos;s nails right down to the wrist with a buzz-saw;&quot; &quot;Why that old gasoline truck, she&apos;s sixty if she&apos;s a minute;&quot; &quot;Gimme a bromide--and put some gin in it!&quot; And the all-female cast, which includes every one from Cora Witherspoon to Butterfly McQueen to Hedda Hopper, plays it with tremendous spark.\n\nThis was the last significant starring role for Norma Shearer, one of MGM&apos;s greatest stars of the 1930s, and she acquits herself very well as the much-wronged Mary Haines. But the real winners are the members of the supporting cast. Joan Crawford is truly astonishing as Crystal Allen, the shop girl who leads Mary&apos;s husband astray, and Rosalind Russell gives an outrageously funny performance as the back-biting gossip whose nasty comments precipitate Mary&apos;s divorce. Indeed, it is hard to do anything except rave about the entire the cast, which includes such diverse performers as Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and Lucille Watson. Even the smallest bit parts score with one-liners that have the impact of a slap in the face, and director George Cukor does an incredible job of keeping everything and every one in sharp focus.\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting things about THE WOMEN is the way in which director Cukor ties the behavior of its characters to their social status. Possessed of absolute leisure and considerable wealth, their energies are inevitably directed into competition for the ultimate status symbol: a successful man. Cukor allows us to sympathize with Mary (Shearer) and laugh at Sylvia (Russell), but he also requires us to pity them--and indirectly encourages grudging admiration for the devious Crystal (Crawford) and the savvy Miriam (Goddard), characters who are considerably more self-reliant. Consequently, not only does THE WOMEN paint a poisonously funny portrait of women as a sex, it takes a hatchet to the society that has shaped their characters as well.\n\nUnfortunately, this landmark comedy has not received the full benefit of what DVD offers. Although the print is crisp, the film has not been restored, and the extras are spurious and hardly do the film justice; while I would recommend the DVD simply because you&apos;re likely to wear out a VHS, the DVD has no great advantage over the VHS release. But whether you have it on VHS or DVD, this is one title that you must have in your collection: you&apos;ll watch it again and again. A must-have! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

There&apos;s a chute that disposes bodies in river, two close-ups of dead people&apos;s faces and a guy falling to his death after a killer stomps on his hands that are holding on for dear life! This is NOT a typical Hollywood film as the American films of this era were a lot less visceral and violent--and the Germans made a scary one.\n\nThe film involves several killings that are somehow connected to a freaky reverend--a blind one who ministers to a flock of blind men. You aren&apos;t sure exactly how he and his ministry is involved through most of the film--but some of the baddies are hiding out in his home for blind men. One is the beastly looking killer who manages to look a lot like Tor Johnson--but a lot uglier! There also is a part by Klaus Kinski--who looks goggle-eyed and crazy throughout the movie. I could say more about the film, but it would spoil the suspense of this horror thriller.\n\nOverall, while not a brilliant film (there are a few lulls here and there), it is very difficult not to be pulled into the film--mostly because it&apos;s so very brutal. Subtle it ain&apos;t--but it is exciting and very, very different.",

      "reviewBody": "Takashi Shimizu is known for his ghost horror films like The Grudge and the lesser known Shock Labyrinth. His latest Tormented is actually a direct sequel to Shock Labyrinth although there is very little talk of the two films being connected. While Labyrinth was fine, it was a bit all over the place and was received mixed reviews. Can Tormented 3D step it up to deliver more that the fans love or will it be another convoluted addition to the genre.\n\nTormented 3D follows a young boy with an unusual friendship with a stuffed toy rabbit. With his father lingering on the brink of insanity and his sister struggling between life and death, the boy sinks ever deeper into the bizarre relationship leading to a shocking series of events. While this works fine as a standalone film, it will make more sense if you see Shock Labyrinth. In this film the main characters see the previous film in the theater and have supernatural consequences in regards to the rabbit aspect. From there this film pretty much goes its own path using the rabbit symbolism to an even bigger scale. This film is better structured than its predecessor which may be why they tried to create an all new film experience and succeeded. The imagery of human sized stuffed rabbit is really disturbing creating an unnerving film experience if you really see what is going on. There are some really cool uses of the rabbit to create some strange moments that builds the bizarre nature of this film.\n\nTakashi has once again delivered a thought provoking film that works even if it is a bit confusing and out there. That is most likely the reason it does work and is way better than the previous film. If you&apos;ve enjoyed his previous films then you will be sure to enjoy this bizarre tale. While not all that scary, there are some strange moments that come off a bit creepy making it work well. It&apos;s recommended you check out the Shock Labyrinth prior to watching this, but if not you will not have any issues following it, but it will create a broader understanding of what is happening.",

It is very good but it is a simple little film, one of those nice films to watch on a Sunday afternoon without having to rack your brain or think too hard.\n\nThe late John Candy excels here as Buck Russell who at first glance is a slob and without much going for him. However, as the film goes on, we learn that Uncle Buck does indeed have a heart. The film really is about a guy who looks like the type of man you would keep your family away from but who is in fact a guy with a heart of gold.\n\nI recommend Uncle Buck to anyone who fancies watching a nice simple little film for the whole family to enjoy. And watch out for the scene with the drunken clown on the doorstep!"

      "name": "Amusing and a nice idea  somewhere inside Celtic Pride is a better film trying to get out",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s game 6 of the NBA playoffs with the Celtics 3-2 up against the Utah Jazz and seemingly about to win the title on their home court in Boston. Lifelong fans Mike O&apos;Hara and Jimmy Flaherty may have personal problems but these are put in perspective opposite the dream of catching the title. However Utah&apos;s best player, Lewis Scott, is carrying the team and responsible for most of their points.  When he destroys the Celtics in game 6, things look bleak.  Bumping into him in a bar later that night, Mike and Jimmy plan to get him so drunk he&apos;ll still he weak in several days time when game 7 is played.  However when they wake up beside him the next morning they kidnap him and plan to hold him until after game 7 has passed.  However things are harder than they imagined.\n\nBeing a basketball fan I&apos;ll give anything that involves the game a try, whether it is more serious films like Blue Chips and He Got Game or comedies like this or Eddie.  This film had potential and, opening with a funny sequence where Mike fails to pass on his passion to his students, it looked like it was going to be good.  The plot is filled out by poking fun at the excessive sports fans and also taking a more serious look from the point of view of the players themselves (as represented by Scott).  However, where things fall down a little is in the delivery.\n\nMarketed as a `wacky&apos; comedy of sorts, the film wants to be that (hence the presence of Aykroyd and Stern) but this means that the more interesting side of the film is ignored and allowed to fall into disrepair (before finally collapsing in the final `7 months later&apos; shot).  As a comedy it is entertaining without ever being very funny  I didn&apos;t laugh out loud very often but I found it passable and light hearted.  It never really gets any better than that sadly, but I felt that this lack of consistent laughs could have been covered if the darker side of the fan/player relationship had been brought out more.\n\nUnfortunately this side slides for the whole of the film until nothing of interest is really left.  There are imaginative touches that suggest a better film, but overall the lack of an effective dramatic streak to the film (no matter how secondary it would have been) is a problem.  Without it the plot seems trivial and makes it harder to hold the audience&apos;s interest. This isn&apos;t helped by the fact that the film feels quite cheap and quickly put together.  This is shown throughout the film but is clearest in it&apos;s portrayal of the basketball action.  I wasn&apos;t expecting them to have the feel of a big stadium or have total realism, but the games are such a joke (in terms the play) that it made me realise how little effort was put into some aspects of the film.\n\nThe cast is OK but the names suggest that a more `zany&apos; comedy was expected to be the outcome of this film.  Aykroyd plays a lesser role but has some good dream sequences, Stern is left to lead the film and he appears to lack the confidence to do it well.  Wayans is the real star here which is a worrying thing.  His character is the strongest and also has the most to say as he is not just a comedy figure in the way the other two are.  He leads well and is actually OK but his basketball scenes are poor.  For He Got Game, Ray Allen coached Washington so he&apos;d look the part, it appears no-one saw the need for that approach here.\n\nOverall this is a wacky comedy with few laughs.  Because it seems to favour the `zany&apos; knockabout side of it&apos;s nature, it neglects the darker more interesting side and suffers as a result.  This film never made it to the cinema in the UK and barely made an impact on video  there are reasons for this."

From their on it really became a flick full of disasters. Donald Pleasence, Rossano Brazzi and Ciccio Ingrassia made their final appearances in this flick. So a lot of rewriting. \n\nPutting in some famous names of the genre like Pleasance, Angus Schrimm and Linnea Quigley didn&apos;t made it even worth viewing (small appearances). The lead, the so-called sex symbol being used to make video clips is another failure, Stefanie Stella, aged only had one feature, her exaggerated boobs. Complete miscasting on that era. Even as she go into a sex scene she is still wearing her knickers while having sex, really?\n\nThe beginning of the flick is okay but once the killings are done, even that isn&apos;t that good on part of shooting, the effects were laughable (machete not going into bodies while hitting them hard) and low on blood, this flick turns into a blah blah flick, sometimes showing the shoot of the clip with Stella. \n\nIt do has the giallo atmosphere, the use of blue and red lighting. The black glove is in tact and the whodunit is overall in this flick but nothing is worth seeing. Like the title said, fatal frames indeed for the production team never to arise again in the scene. \n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 1/5 Story 1,5/5 Comedy 0/5",

      "name": "Excellent last film by the great John Ford with epic battles , intense drama and spectacular scenes",
      "reviewBody": "Historical and overlong movie recounting the legendary Cheyenne trek led by the Indian chiefs , Little Wolf and Dull Knife . The picture is an epic portrait of the historic story about celebrated Cheyenne (they are actually Navajo , telling dirty jokes in their native tongue) and their legendary feat leading the tribe on a journey to freedom , uprooting them from the Yellowstone and resettling them in distant Oklahoma . This majestic flick illustrates the callous disregard with which the government treated the Cheyenne in the 1880s as the US agency fails to deliver even the meager provisions due by peace treaty to the stubborn tribe in their stark desert reserve without proper supplies for survival ; then the starving Indians have taken more abuse than it&apos;s worth and break it too by embarking on a 1,500 miles trek back to their ancestral hunting grounds , being led by Little Wolf and Dull Knife (Ford was urged by producers to cast first stars as Richard Boone and Anthony Quinn , as both had Native American blood ; however , Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland, who were of Mexican descent , were cast instead) . Meanwhile , proud Cheyenne tribe square off US cavalry commanded by Thomas Archer (Richard Widmark) who leads his army on a wild chase across the barren plains in this saga of the old west . Red Shirt (played by Sal Mineo , though John Ford would not allow him to speak any English dialog in the picture due to the actor&apos;s Bronx accent) , a rebel Indian does the first shot against cavalry . Captain Thomas Archer goes to deal with Secretary of Interior Schulz about the unfortunate Indians (Spencer Tracy was first cast , but had a stroke and was replaced by Edward G. Robinson, , including the background had to be done with screen process and whose scenes were entirely photographed in studios) , taking place a climatic meeting scene between Shultz and the Cheyenne chiefs . The tribe refuses to surrender in this chronicle of a bitter fight between the tribe and the US cavalry in the struggle for the west . Now the mightiest true adventure of all! Filmed by 6-time Academy Award winner John Ford...with a massive all-star cast! .1,500 miles of heroism and incredible adventure!\n\nThis sprawling epic film displays Western action , shootouts , drama and spectacular battles . It&apos;s a thoughtful piece for its time that had an original tragic ending and imbued with moments of sensitive poetry . This nice Western contains interesting characters , full of wide open space and dramatic moments . This classic , sturdy picture ranks as one of the most sentimental of John Ford&apos;s work . Thought-provoking , enjoyable screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface and suggested by Mari Sandoz in &quot;Cheyenne Autumn¨ with screenplay by James R. Webb and based on a novel titled Last Frontier by Howard Fast who also wrote Spartacus . This excellent film featuring a magnificent performance by the whole main cast , including a top-notch supporting cast . Awesome Richard Widmark in a larger-than-life character along with a gorgeous Carrol Baker and a magnificent Karl Malden as deranged captain Wessels . In the film appears , as usual , Ford&apos;s favourite actors such as : Ben Johnson , Harry Carey Jr. , Mike Mazurki , George O&apos;Brien , Mae Marsh , Patrick Wayne , Dolores Del Rio , Ken Curtis , Elizabeh Allen , Willis Bouchey , and , of course , James Stewart as obstinate sheriff Earp . Ford added the segment with Stewart in place of an intermission , in spite of the film was overlong , and so he came up with the Wyatt Earp segment , giving Stewart an awesome interpretation , as usual . Outdoors are pretty gorgeous and well photographed in Super Panavision 70mm by William H. Clothier , Ford&apos;s regular , and filmed on location in Moab, Utah ,Fort Laramie, Wyoming, Monument Valley, Utah , Gunnison Canyon , Colorado . Rousing and an impressive musical score by Alex North who composed other masterpieces as Spartacus and Cleopatra.\n\nThis may not be Ford&apos;s best Western , as many would claim , but it&apos;s still head ad shoulders above most big-scale movies . You&apos;ll find the ending over-dramatic according to your tastes , though it&apos;s lovingly composed by John Ford who really picks up battle , drama and sensibility towards the ending . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching . The motion picture well produced by Bernard Smith was brilliantly directed by John Ford at his last film . This powerful movie will appeal to Indian Western fans .",

It doesn&apos;t better anything by Robert Bresson and it would have a fight with most films by Mike Leigh.\n\nThe point is that worth the watch and I justify that by the fact it put me in mind of the two above truly great directors.\n\nThis is Birgit Möller first and only full length feature from 2006 (14 years ago!).\n\nI hope we haven&apos;t just miss the next Robert Bresson or Mike Leigh.\n\nI watched &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; recently, that has 361,782 votes and is rated at 8.4/10, possibly we get the cinema we deserve, with a odd film like &quot;Valerie&quot; which is better than we deserve.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Swarm&quot; has its share of flaws, no doubt about that: it&apos;s overlong, it&apos;s filled with genre cliches (many veterans cast in pointless supporting roles, indifferent romances) and it&apos;s occasionally overacted, especially by Michael Caine, who has a role far below his abilities. However, those who are calling it &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;campy&quot; are REALLY overdoing it. The special effects are actually FIRST-RATE and most of the attack sequences are utterly convincing. Don&apos;t judge the film on the basis of its bad reputation; watch it for yourself and you&apos;ll discover that, while it&apos;s not an &quot;art&quot; film, it&apos;s an agreeable way to kill two hours.",

It was the most expensive movie made up to that time, and it shows that silent films really COULD create spectacle on a grand scale.\n\nOne of the posters remarked on how ridiculous the Klansmen&apos;s hoods looked. Actually, the original &quot;ghost costumes&quot; were all homemade and there was no standardized uniform- some had spikes on the head, horns, painted faces on the masks, etc. \n\nI myself had an ancestor who was a member of the Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan, and they saw themselves as guerilla fighters against an occupying power, not as terrorists. Today we can condemn them. At the time, it must have seemed to them that the war was over, but that the battle lines were still firmly drawn.\n\nThis film is a good peek into the attitude of the general public in 1915 about Reconstruction. It became a national obsession, and probably gave impetus to Col. William Joseph Simmons&apos;s decision to &quot;resurrect&quot; the Klan in that year."

And the &apos;real life&apos; danger the boy faces is both interesting and handled in a comical manner to appeal to children.\n\nBut overall, it appeals tob this adult just because it&apos;s a cute story, with good actors."

      "reviewBody": "Although I didn&apos;t live there during the time the movie was made I did venture up one afternoon to see what the town looked like as a movie set. Remarkably, the town looked much like I remembered from my childhood in the 60&apos;s and it was a nice journey back in time. While living in Arizona (&apos;92-2001) I would frequently watch the movie when I was homesick; I enjoyed seeing my old town, my old schools &amp; the surrounding scenic shots. I am now living back in Concrete and sadly, the town has wasted away to nothing; but with This Boy&apos;s Life I can go back for an hour or so to when it was a really great place to live and grow-up. The real-life Dwight has since died (everyone who knew him says he was just like book and movie portrayed him) and his real kids dispute the fact that he was an abusive father. Tobias Wolff is, of course, now a well-known writer but remembered as a nice, fun-loving kid who did pretty well weathering the constant stress at home while growing up. A number of Concrete residents still resent the portrayal of our town as a back-woods redneck community that harbors child-abusers. \n\nUnfortunately, the truth hurts &amp; that description pretty much sums up our little spot on the map. But we do have some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, lots of fresh air and no gangs so I guess we are better off than a lot of urban environments. Leo DiCaprio did a great job in his role. Ellen Barkin was memorable but I had a hard time feeling much empathy for her character. DiNiro was - well...DiNiro. Every role he touches becomes gold and this one will shine for a long time. This movie was highly underrated in my opinion (and not just because I was biased) and should have gotten more notice after it&apos;s release. You can still see it on the pay channels, occasionally on cable networks and of course, video &amp; DVD. The sets, clothing, and music really do justice to the time. See it and you will never forget it! ***small tidbit: on my trip up to Concrete to visit the set I was happened upon DiNiro, DiCaprio &amp; Barkin filming the scene where they were driving for the first time into Concrete. The local sheriff had closed off the highway until the scene was completed but because I knew the area and side rural roads I sneaked up to a spot where I could videotape the car with the three inside going down the highway. I DID get decent video of DiNiro &quot;driving&quot; the car and was thrilled!",

I don&apos;t think most teens could accept the idea that they are not good, not bad, just blah with such grace. a real human would not just shrug and accept his loserness..when he seemed to have a glimmer of more. It takes longer for life to beat you down at that.\n\nI walked out of the movie theater at the age of 17 thinking &quot;THIS SUCKED compared to FERRIS BUELLER&quot; and I was right. 15 years later, I am still right.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this Run Run Shaw production on YT, where it was posted as being from 1958--evidently confusing it with a different &quot;Oily Man&quot; film from that year which appears (as far as I can tell) to be lost. They and other films are based on a figure of Malay folklore, although here the &quot;Oily Man&quot; doesn&apos;t turn up until the last 15 minutes or so...and you could say it&apos;s an irrational appearance, since the hero has been wronged exclusively by men, yet as the &quot;Oily Man&quot; he avenges himself only on women.\n\nAnyway, before it becomes a monster movie (with a great, bizarre ending) in the last lap, this is an odd mixture of other things. It starts out as a sort of &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; thing in a remote village, where bullies torment the artistically talented but shunned protagonist because he is misshapen of face and body. When things go from bad to worse, suddenly he is in a studio-soundstage &quot;heaven&quot; of sorts, where he is allowed one wish--to be handsome--and falls in love with a beautiful elf. (At least that&apos;s how she&apos;s identified in the subtitles.)\n\nThis section is goofy and fun, with musical numbers. Unfortunately, he is not allowed to stay there, and his triumphant return to Earth as a good-looking, elegantly dressed man goes wrong when he breaks the one rule he had promised to observe in exchange for his physical transformation. His punishment is to become...&quot;The Oily Man.&quot; Though as I said, it doesn&apos;t make much sense that in this guise he runs around attacking innocent women, rather than his erstwhile tormenters.\n\nThis is a lively, eccentric and polished movie that doesn&apos;t fit into any precise genre category, but manages to pull off its sometimes-clashing different elements (sob story, celestial fantasy, horror, musical) with sufficient professionalism that it all provides giddy entertainment value--even if it hardly seems an organic mix. Apparently the central actor was the preeminent Malay screen star of this era, a period that is probably worth investigating further, as I really don&apos;t know a thing about it and quite enjoyed this somewhat campy but well-made artifact. In terms of production values, it&apos;s on the level of an above-average U. S. major-studio &quot;B&quot; film of the era, albeit with a few scenes featuring large #&apos;s of extras as dancers/villagers. Or a &quot;cast of hunderds,&quot; as the opening credits rather awkwardly put it.",

      "reviewBody": "Ralph Walker, the young man at the center of this story, gets more than his share of bad situations at a tender age. Ralph, who has lost his father, sees his own mother struck by a serious illness and watches her go into a coma. Ralph&apos;s spirit is never broken and never questions his bad luck the way some other teen would. Ralph is never given to despair, or emotional outbursts when he can&apos;t do much to help the situations he is thrown into. Ultimately, Ralph is a real winner, not only because he decides to do something about his life, but because he is an optimist at heart who will never be defeated.\n\nMichael McGowan, the Canadian creator of this enormously appealing film has gathered the right elements to make us go with him in this fantastic voyage that shows us the positive side of life. Mr. McGowan was lucky in getting Adam Kutcher to portray Ralph Walker. This young actor shows us he is a natural who under the guidance of the director, gives a tremendous performance and steals our hearts in the process.\n\n&quot;Saint Ralph&quot; is one of the best things that have come out of Canada in recent years. Campbell Scott gives a good performance as Father Hibbert, the man who guides Ralph in the right direction. The excellent Gordon Pinsent, makes the perfect head master Father Fitzpatrick, a man who is never in touch with the young people he is supposed to lead and help shape their minds into being good citizens. Jennifer Tilly, Tamara Hope, Shauna MacDonald, and Michael Kaney, are also seen in key minor roles.\n\nThe film is highly recommended because it gives the viewer a positive take on life. Michael McGowan must be congratulated in giving us a movie that will be hard to forget because it feels real from beginning to end.",

And in fact the makers of this film reached similar points to the novel &quot;The Historian&quot; from different paths. It is obvious from their dates of publication that both researched the topic heavily but neither influenced the other.\n\nAnyway, perhaps it started out with a stronger script and got destroyed in editing, but the mess that we&apos;re left with at the end is pretty bad. Unforgivably bad plot movement, TV-movie cinematography and terrible editing whack this film in the end. You might enjoy parts of it, but the end result is a confused mess. There are good performances - by the entire cast, mind you - and lovely, appropriate locations. Certainly better than the abysmal 2005 &quot;Way of the Vampire&quot;, but unfortunately the shortcomings outweigh the positives here.",

There was a magic about the first film where everything just worked, whereas this time around, nothing worked and for the most part was rather unfunny. Watch the first ten-twenty minutes for the return of Ty Webb, and then go about your business..."

She will be 49 later this year, 2018.\n\nBut I never went to any music festivals. So finding this film on DVD was a joy. It has a good mix of on-stage performances and views of the mostly young crowd away from the stage. While I didn&apos;t know any of them I recognize all of them. That is how we looked and behaved in the late 1960s.\n\nFunny, when I was younger I avoided Janis Joplin, I just hated her singing style. But I saw a documentary on her, I became a fan of sorts. And here at roughly 25 minutes into the documentary she performs &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; which was a real show-stopper., showing her extremely wide range of talent. There is a memorable shot of Mama Cass Elliot in the crowd mouthing &quot;WOW&quot; when Janis&apos; performance was over.\n\nAnyway, good film that brings back good memories."

The male lead is sort of charming, and it would be nice to find out if his range extended into any other emotions as the story developed, or if he stayed locked in the same surly shyness all the way through. But the female lead is so unbelievably obnoxious that I couldn&apos;t get past about 25 minutes.\n\nEVERY TIME she came on screen and opened her mouth or gave that stupid dimply smirk I cringed, and I wanted some berserk extra to run up and punch her very hard in the face. Nobody ever did, and I couldn&apos;t stand any more of her, so I stopped watching. It&apos;s not like I HAD to watch this movie.\n\nIt&apos;s amazing that such an obnoxious person ever got hired to be in anything, even a direct-to-video flop like this. I need to look up her name so I can be very sure never to see her again. Rachel Nichols. Yuck."

It was My favorite Pleasant Goat movie of all time!!! :D\n\nIn this movie: Hong Tai Lang and Mei Yang Yang, and Nuan Yang Yang arguably become &quot;Magical Girls&quot; in this wonderful movie, and Xi Yang Yang and his friends are trying to save The Dragon realm from an evil Robot Dragon, and My favorite part of this Pleasant Goat movie of all time was Xiao Hui Hui screaming and running away from Loud noises while Playing music while Practicing to be &quot;Troopers&quot; ROFL.\n\nSo If you like Magical Girls, Dragons, and etc. This Pleasant Goat movie for you. :3",

Great set-up for a story that takes a slow spiral downward once the couple returns home (to a rather lovely cottage in Southern California). Some sparks from principals Robert Redford and Demi Moore, but Woody Harrelson is out of his league and Adrian Lyne&apos;s direction is all visual and nothing much upstairs (and I could&apos;ve done without the horse-racing video suddenly morphing into a shot of Demi in &quot;the act&quot;). The film is shamefully enjoyable, and capped with teen-romance fever, but aren&apos;t these characters a little old for moony-eyed puppy love? ** from ****",

There was a lot of thrills and suspense building up not far too into the movie, and that was what was working the best for this particular movie.\n\nActually the cast did a good job with their roles, and each brought something good, solid and unique to the movie with their individual roles. Not award-winning performances, but still very good shows of talents here.\n\nThere weren&apos;t really any twists to the storyline, except for one that was revealed at the very end, but you saw it coming, so it wasn&apos;t a moment of utter surprise by then.\n\nI am not going to spoil it here and say what the movie is about, but trust me, &quot;13 Hrs&quot; will keep you riveted to your chair throughout the entire feature. You just want to see what waits around the next corner and see what is going to happen.\n\nThough, honestly, I do not see this movie as having enough value or weight in it for a second viewing. Having seen it once, is enough, and I doubt it that I will ever be returning to watch it a second time around. It was good, just not that good. But for a non-Hollywood movie, they actually pulled it off well enough. The movie had definite potential and could have been so much more. Now, I am not saying it is a bad movie, not at all. They just didn&apos;t get as much out of the movie as they could have, which actually is a shame.",

Kindergarten Cop is a little overlong and the villains are perhaps a little too pantomime. However, the film does look lovely, and the score and soundtrack gives it its heart-warming sentiment.\n\nThe script also worked. It was funny, it was poignant and it was well-meaning, while there is also a heart-warming story, good direction and pacing and the action while sometimes intense is well-handled.\n\nI was very surprised by the acting. Kindergarten Cop is not Arnold Schwarznegger&apos;s best film, but it does show that he can do comedy, and here he does do it well. He is suitably low-key and avoids being wooden as well. Penelope Ann Miller gives good support as well, and the chemistry between the two is convincing without taking over the film too much. The characters could have easily been stereotypical and unlikeable, but they aren&apos;t, instead they have a certain warmth to them, and this is including the kids.\n\nOverall, not a comedy classic, but it works far better than it should have done. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Certainly the greatest cast of cult actors ever to appear together, well, ever. This movie is terrible and magnificent in equal measure. To me it is staggeringly watchable. The premise is seriously skewered yet endearing all the same: 1950s English truckdrivers behaving like 1850s American outlaws in a Never Never Land where trucks are allowed to habitually run at 80mph down country lanes without so much a peep from the plod. \n\nMcGoohan is a star turn here and Peggy Cummins makes for a surprisingly un-frigid lead (look, the UK film industry in the 1950s didn&apos;t do sexy -what do you mean Diana Dors? - proves my point!!). But the film belongs to Baker - brooding, smouldering, moral, vengeful, utterly magnificent. We don&apos;t make them like him, or like this any more."

Note that the music is by Hans Eisler, an important film composer who worked with T.W. Adorno on &quot;Composition for the Film;&quot; and Curt Bois, who plays Puntila, acted in this role under Brecht&apos;s own direction. This film can be compared with Hans-Juergen Syberberg&apos;s documentary film (&quot;Syberberg filmt bei Brecht&quot;) of Brecht&apos;s own stage production with Curt Bois.  One only misses DEFA film actor Erwin Geschonneck, who was Matti in the play.  An important film for 20th century theater history. Cavalcanti&apos;s added framing sequences with sung commentary by the female servants is very much in Brechtian spirit.  Much of the dialogue of the play is preserved unchanged.  Cavalcanti&apos;s added scenes of Finnish nature are also completely in the spirit of the original play, where the beauty of the countryside was meant to contrast with lopsided human relations.",

For instance, the very first shot of the factory immediately brings to mind Chaplin&apos;s _Modern Times_ and Lang&apos;s _Metropolis_.  The first minutes of the film, until Joe is called into the doctor&apos;s office, are filmed almost in black and white.  The tones are all grey, black, or taupe, with some glaring whites.  Then the door to the doctor&apos;s office opens to show warm leather, paneling, and firelight, and it&apos;s a sudden reminder of _The Wizard of Oz_, when Dorothy opens the door into Oz and the movie changes from black and white to color.\n\nI also look for the &quot;crooked path,&quot; which shows up four times at different parts of the movie.  When Joe says, &quot;We&apos;ve come a long way on a crooked path,&quot; we know exactly what he&apos;s referring to!\n\nI could go on with these details for pages, but I don&apos;t want to leave out the main reason this is my favorite film.  It is one of the most life-affirming movies I have ever seen.  When I had received devastatingly bad news about my health, this is the movie I watched, and it helped get me over the hump and start integrating the condition into my life.\n\nMovies like this are one of the reasons for having movies at all, and I will continue watching it, as I return again and again to favorite books, for the rest of my life."

We get the same boring clichés and jump scares packaged under different titles with little originality. That is not to say that there aren&apos;t some very good American horror films to be produced since the 1980s but the more Asian horror that I watch the more I see that they have taken up the torch and are producing the best horror movies of the era.\n\nDark Water isn&apos;t necessarily one of the best Asian horror films to come out but it certainly is a good one. The American remake is really indicative of what is wrong with the industry in North America. The story is the same and many of the scenes are very similar but for some reason, some intangible reason, it is of remarkably lower quality. Even with a very talented actress in the lead role it still doesn&apos;t shine like the Japanese original, even though it possesses every required ingredient. It is these intangibles that the Asian horror scene has somehow mastered and the American scene has lost.\n\nDark Water itself is a nice little ghost story. It is a slow-burner with an unsettling tale and reveals itself subtlety. The characters are not throw away fodder as in many modern American horror tales and there are some scenes that had me, a hardened horror veteran, wanting to squint my eyes at the television screen. This is not American horror in the sense that everything is not in your face blood, gore, and knife wielding psychos. This is a much more subtle, psychological tale. It will creep under your skin.\n\nAsian horror is the new standard. I hope that the American industry will learn thing a thing or two from the Asian scene and not just try to emulate it so that perhaps the next generation of filmmakers can bring the torch of horror back to the United States.",

Co-starring with Nicholson is Mary Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd. Music is by Perry Botkin Junior and cinematography by Nestor Almendros. \n\n1866, Longhorn, Texas and plot finds Nicholson as Henry Lloyd Moon, a small time outlaw who is captured and sentenced to hang. But a strange ordinance from Civil War days allows a condemned man to escape the gallows if an unmarried lady of the town is prepared to take him as a husband. Enter Julie Tate (Steenburgen), a virginal lady who is poles apart from the crude and scruffy Moon, who takes him in purely to help her work in the mine on her land that she insists contains gold. Could these two opposites actually develop a relationship? Can there be trust there? Will Moon survive the wrath of vengeful deputy Towfield (Lloyd) who believes Moon stole his gal?\n\nBarely noticed upon release, where few critics of the day were prepared to give it some credit, Jack Nicholson&apos;s second film as a director found a firm fan base down in the cult basement. The advent of DVD has seen it get more exposure to film fans and critics and its stock has risen. Yes! It&apos;s still a bit too off-beat for some, the quirky comedy Western has always struggled to get mainstream praise anyway, but viewing these days it plays out as enjoyable fare whilst simultaneously giving us early glimpses of future stars of film. \n\nIn truth the film&apos;s comedic high points come in the first quarter and Nicholson strains to reach those heights again. Once the odd couple retreat to the genteel out of the way matrimonial home, the simple premise takes over and the couple engage in a battle of wills between horny beast and angelic being. On the edges of the frame popping in to view from time to time are hostile railroad officials putting the squeeze on Julia as they want her land, deputy Towfield and his cronies and Moon&apos;s old gang, the latter of which provides the catalyst for chaos. Sometimes crude, sometimes silly, the film does retain amusing worth throughout, with some zippy lines that remain quotable. Nicholson and Steenburgen are perfect foil for each other, so it&apos;s well performed and it also looks nice thanks to Almendros&apos; photography.\n\nThe likes of John Belushi, Danny DeVito, Veronica Cartwright and Tracey Walter are in the support slots, none of whom get time enough to really impact upon the proceedings as their fans would like. It&apos;s interesting to see Lloyd and Steenburgen working together in the genre this early, because they would reteam in the Western themed third part of the Back to the Future trilogy 12 years later. While further continuation novelty sees Lloyd, DeVito and Nicholson back together after working on One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest in 75. DeVito would swap chairs with Nicholson and direct the star in Hoffa in 1992.\n\nMore a amiable smile inducer than a side splitter, Going&apos; South is worth seeking out if you have a kink for off-beat Oaters. 7/10",

      "name": "Too weak for such a powerful premise",
      "reviewBody": "An unusual phenomenon is spreading in the world. Humans randomly start mutating into animals. The cause of this process is unknown, and the treatments do not give results. The film focuses on a high school student who lives with his father, while his mother is in the process of mutation in a specialized institution.\n\n&quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot; is a coming-of-age drama with elements of fantasy and horror and some humor. It can be interpreted in various ways, literally and metaphorically, but I don&apos;t want to get into that multitude of interpretations, let everyone judge for themselves. I will present only my impressions, positive and negative.\n\nThe film is visually beautiful. Cinematography, make-up, and effects are superb, and for much less money than in Hollywood. The creatures, for lack of a better term, are striking and endearing. Romain Duris is good in the role of the father, and Paul Kircher in the role of the son gave an Oscar-worthy performance. I like the messages that the film sends, and the main asset is certainly the originality of the premise and the approach to it.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, the script is too weak for such an original and interesting idea. The story is insufficiently developed, especially for a film of over two hours. You will not find out how and why these mutations occur and on what scale. If humans devolved into lower primates, the film would fall into the realm of sci-fi, but as they randomly mutate into literally anything and everything, not just mammals, but insects, reptiles, amphibians, and birds, I&apos;d rather classify it as fairy tale fantasy, which conflicts with the very realistic tone of the film. I get the impression that &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot; got dissolved in trying to cover too many themes and send too many messages across too many genres, and as a result, it felt sketchy and tepid. The authors bit off more than they could swallow and failed to fulfill the big potential of the project they embarked on.\n\nOverall, a technically good but essentially disappointing film. Still, it&apos;s worth watching, if for no other reason than for the contrast to the garbage America is showering us with, the original ideas and performance of Paul Kircher.\n\n7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "There are times when RITA HAYWORTH, with her flashing eyes, heady mane of tresses and way with castanets and Spanish dances, amply fills the role of Carmen in THE LOVES OF CARMEN. She captures the flirtatious moods and stormy temperament without any trouble at all, and yet somehow every ravishing close-up reminds us that she has just been all glammed up by the make-up artist, every brush on her lips and hair and brows just given the royal Hollywood glamor treatment. Her glamor is so distracting that it renders her Carmen unrealistic, even though she certainly has the temperament to go with the part.\n\nGLENN FORD is somber, stalwart and rugged enough as Don Jose but it doesn&apos;t seem like ideal casting. He looks uncomfortable in much of the early footage and only comes to life when he has killed a man and must spend the rest of the film on flight as a bandit and desperado in the rugged mountains. His performance strengthens and his love/hate relationship with Carmen is, for the most part, quite believable.\n\nBut some pseudo-Spanish music in the background score with a hint of Bizet would have been a wise approach to scoring the film. And giving Rita more than a couple of fiery dances would have been a smarter idea. As it is, her dancing moments are when she most completely captures the spirit of Carmen.\n\nIt&apos;s entertaining, in a lumbering sort of way--not exactly the most well paced version of the story. Hayworth is gorgeous to look at with a peaches and cream complexion that fairly glows in Technicolor, but all of her close-ups remind us that she is The Love Goddess being given the high gloss glamor treatment by the studio that made her a star.\n\nBut, reservations aside, for fans of Hayworth and Ford, this is a must see.",

      "reviewBody": "Buster Keaton catapults himself down a steep hillside, an avalanche of pebbles, rocks and boulders tumbling in his wake. If any one of these objects were to strike him down, he would certainly be killed by the impact. He is almost escaping the rocks now; just a few more seconds of frantic sprinting is required. Suddenly, Keaton looks up, only to find a massive horde of woman striding purposefully towards him. He is stuck between a rock and a hard place: an avalanche behind him, and a flock of would-be brides ahead. Quickly and delicately weighing his chances of survival either way, Keaton turns determinedly towards the barrage of boulders. It is hilarious little moments like this that make Buster Keaton&apos;s silent comedies such a joy to watch, and &apos;Seven Chances&apos; is certainly one of the funniest I&apos;ve seen, brimming with the talented actor&apos;s trademark deadpan humour.\n\nThe premise on which the story is based is singularly ridiculous, and so this allows Keaton to have a great deal of fun, placing his character in appropriately bizarre situations. Young Jimmy Shannon (Keaton) loves his sweetheart Mary Jones (Ruth Dwyer), but can never quite muster up the courage to tell her, and most certainly could never take that plunge into marriage. However, one day he discovers that his grandfather has left him the princely sum of $7 million, but only if he gets married by 7 PM that day! After he is rejected by Mary (due to an unfortunate misunderstanding), Jimmy seeks out another would-be bride, ultimately realising that finding a wife isn&apos;t as easy as he had hoped. The first half of the film is admittedly light on Keaton&apos;s patented stunt-work, but it remains a clever and witty situation comedy, with poor Jimmy suffering the laughter of onlookers as he moves from one girl to the next, tentatively asking for their hands in marriage.\n\nWhen all this fails, an advertisement in the afternoon-edition newspaper brings hundreds of women to Jimmy&apos;s side, but by now he&apos;s realised that Mary is the only girl he could ever marry. As he struggles desperately to get to her home by 7:00, he is pursued by a horde of money-crazy ladies: big and small, young and old, beautiful and ugly. This is truly where Keaton comes into his element, and a hectic scramble down a hillside  pursued by an avalanche of rocks  is the film&apos;s most memorable moment {the idea for this scene came by accident, when Keaton inadvertently dislodged some rocks while he was running. The preview audience responded so favourably that he decided to re-shoot an extended sequence}. The paper-mâché rocks look quite convincing, and I was pretty much fooled into thinking that Keaten was really dodging the real thing (until I noticed him get bowled over by one of the boulders, without any apparent ill-effects!) &apos;Seven Chances&apos; moves by at such a frenetic pace that there isn&apos;t a moment that could be trimmed. Though it runs for just 56 minutes, I had a huge smile on my face for every single one of them.",

The casting was erratic at best (c&apos;mon...Joe Flaherty and Robin Duke of SCTV fame?) and though the pace was fairly quick in the right places, you still had the sense that too much was crammed into too little a film all too late. The name, &quot;Blue Monkey&quot;?? What&apos;s with that? Probably a red herring only the writer and director are aware of."

I watched this movie alone in the dark at midnight, with my DTS surround sound speakers, and it scared the HELL out of me! This movie intends to makes you feel damp, filthy and frightening. It takes itself very seriously, no jokes. The horror is non-stop, not allowing you to take a break. The fright and the gore satisfies most horror fans. Good style, good cinematography, well-directed. Of course, this movie cannot be compared to the original, but this is a pretty damn good horror movie itself.",

See IMDb entry for that film.\n\nFilm scholar Jeanpaul Goergen has written:\n\n&quot;This film is not preserved, as far as I know, but according to the reviews it was a mixture of live action, special effects and different animation techniques.

Neither author or director could use the &apos;based on a true story&apos; epitaph simply because the events are completely unverifiable; but reading the book -- and watching the film to a certain degree -- does give a sense that these events did occur.\n\nKnowing that the film is a reasonably accurate portrayal of real events -- William Wharton was said to be impressed by the final cut -- makes the events portrayed in the film even more moving. It also explains why the director chose to focus on certain scenes to keep the story flowing, it was as if he wanted to commit the &apos;story&apos; to film before it was forgotten.\n\nHaving said that, there are touches of directorial brilliance and subtlety in this bleak and wintry tale. For example, the panning shot of the squad of soldiers walking through the forest which finishes with the still picture of a frozen hand -- if you even notice it -- is unforgettable.\n\nThese were true events according to the author; it is worth keeping that in mind when you watch the film.",

      "reviewBody": "On a marque crammed with tired summer offerings of over-the-top comedies and action films, I spotted the sweet, small film, &quot;Henry Poole is Here.&quot; Like a name sprawled under an aqueduct bridge, it was barely noticeable.\n\n&quot;Henry Poole is Here&quot; is a quiet little film with a big premise. What do you do when you&apos;re an atheist and you learn you have six weeks to live? If you&apos;re Henry Poole, (Luke Wilson), you buy a house in a neighborhood where nobody knows you, numb yourself with booze, and wait around to die - alone. Henry&apos;s plan to fade away unnoticed is disrupted when his neighbor, Esperanza, (Adrianna Barrazza) starts worshiping a water-stained image of Christ she sees on his stucco wall.\n\nTo make matters worse, Esperanza is moved to share this miracle with her church and friends. A silent little girl tape records Henry&apos;s pleas to be left alone. But Henry never gets his wish. The little girl and her luminescent mother (Radha Mitchell) enter his life to show him that we are all here for a reason. In fact, the whole neighborhood is there for him - whether he likes it or not.\n\nThe director, Mark Pellington, leaves it for us to decide whether we believe it&apos;s a miracle or not. At first, we don&apos;t even get to see what Esperanza is looking at. Later, we see the stain, but the face is kind of illusive - sometimes it&apos;s there, sometimes it&apos;s not. The film doesn&apos;t tell you what to believe. But it shows the strength in believing and especially our belief in others.\n\nHopefully, this film doesn&apos;t fade away unnoticed amidst the jungle of summer releases. Hopefully, it finds a community that believes in it. This is a movie about hope, after all. I, for one, believe.\n\nMovie blessings! Jana Segal reelinspiration dot blogspot dot com",

      "reviewBody": "Making a film from a book or play, regardless of how many times it was previously made is different than recasting an old TV sitcom and turning into a feature film.  The difference is that in the first instance the films are based on characters as written down on paper from the mind of it&apos;s creator.  No matter how many times A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE is remade it always goes back to the characters, not the actors who portrayed them. Audiences will keep going back to the same play or film each time it is recast to see the subtle difference the recasting will change the role. That is why film versions of hit Broadway plays can be so successful. Remaking a TV sitcom is different.  The new cast is not portraying the characters as originally written, they are portraying the actors&apos; characterizations.  So in films like THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES we are treated to what is essentially a Saturday Night Live style parody.  Of course, some of the best SNL skits are parody and it is fun to watch when done well (impressions done well, and of course a good sense of poking fun at a beloved show).  THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE was perhaps the best example of this. THE ADDAMS FAMILY was a remake, opting to go back to the original characters as created by Charles Addams in his comic strip.  BATMAN and SUPERMAN also went back to their roots in the comic books and skipped most references to the TV show.  In THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, the characters of Jed Clampett, Granny and the rest of the clan were created by Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, etc...and I really doubt any of the new cast searched out notes of the characters so much as they just reviewed the old shows.  This is all right and in good fun and we have to keep in mind that Jim Varney is not so much playing Jed Clampett as he is playing Buddy Ebsen&apos;s Jed Clampett.  Recently, someone went ahead and remade Laurel and Hardy (in which the characters and the actors were one and the same).  It flopped because it wasn&apos;t a parody and the film treated the characters as if the original Stan and Ollie were merely players.  THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES does not make this mistake, opting to literally morph the new cast out of our memories of the old cast.  This movie has a cast that is hip, fun, and funny (you got to love a film that boasts a perfect, if not quite obvious casting of Jim Varney, Erika Eleniak, and Lily Tomlin--all giving great comedic performances).  Is it better than the original?  No, and I don&apos;t think it was suppose to be.  It was just suppose to be a way to laugh at our past, and perhaps give fans a feeling that they are not alone with their adoration of one of the great TV shows of all time."

      "reviewBody": "I had watched THE CORPSE VANISHES (1942) a couple of years ago but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised as to how watchable and engaging it was the second time around. Who&apos;d have thought that such fare was worth a second look? If anything, I found CORPSE to be even livelier than GHOST (which did get to be repetitious and feel constrained by its one setting): although it is never explained why Lugosi is married to an 80-year old woman (except maybe to get into high society given that she&apos;s a &quot;Countess&quot;) or why she needs to be youthful (it&apos;s not like she&apos;s parading her &quot;look&quot; anywhere except at the Lorenz household), the film offers an amusing throwback to those 30s hard-boiled reporter movies and predates such rejuvenation-themed horror movies as I VAMPIRI (1956).\n\nI found the film to be quite atmospheric and enjoyable: it was nice to watch Lugosi surrounded by such familiar faces as Elizabeth Russell (from several Val Lewton films), Angelo Rossitto (one of Tod Browning&apos;s FREAKS [1932]) and Vince Barnett (who had a memorable supporting role in Hawks&apos; SCARFACE [1932]) among others. That said, the campier elements of the film were sometimes too silly for words: Lugosi whipping his moronic assistant, the proverbial funereal organ-playing, the even more hilarious sight of Lugosi and Russell sleeping in coffins and the final shoot-out with the police in which, of all people, it&apos;s Lugosi&apos;s dwarfish henchman who gets it!\n\nIn the end, I guess I wouldn&apos;t mind watching Lugosi&apos;s other stuff from this period but I doubt if it will make me enough of a fan to go out and purchase them in their best available prints on DVD.",

The box cover suggested that this person was actually more fussy about his pianos than his clients were, but in fact it is the other way around.\n\nMost of the film centers on a French pianist and composer and how fussy he is about how his pianos sound and how he insists on other pianos because one doesn&apos;t sound right to him, and the technician has not only to tune the piano but find people the right stools, add crazy-looking devices to the pianos to change its sound, change components of the piano to satisfy the various players, and go through a lot of aggravation.\n\nProblem is, that&apos;s the movie in a nutshell, and it gets repetitive and boring without telling much else. Also included is a scene of preparing a piano for a comedy act, which was amusing, but overall the movie takes too much time to say too little.",

It also lacks in the quality of the cinematography of the original. It is almost unwatchable.\n\nThe ending to the original Donnie Darko was absolutely superior. It absolutely completed the story and left the viewer to ponder the meaning and philosophical implications of the work quietly to themselves. There was no antagonist to be reviled from the dead to fight again and no antagonist, having saved the world once to be brought out of a failed marriage and rehab somewhere to save the world again. I do not mind watching movie series even movies such as Saw or Rocky. But Donnie Darko is not the type of movie that could possibly lend itself well to a series and it doe not deserve to be put in a category with those types of movies and the attempt to do so is a complete failure.",

How a potential technology could really cause problems in the here and now. This movie hit on a few of them, some of which HAVE come to pass.\n\nHis premise is that computers could be used to simulate characters (already has happened) and that they could be used to influence us by using algorithms to calculate our optimum responses. (Again, probably happening now, even if we don&apos;t know about it.) \n\nThe plot is that a plastic surgeon is asked to alter four women into perfect specimens, but three of them are killed after wards (they never really explain why.) In trying to protect the last, whom he develops a personal bond with, he uncovers a plot to use computer generated images (wow, and now they are real!) to manipulate our responses.\n\nA note on nudity. We have Susan Dey of Partridge family fame going topless in a couple of scenes. We&apos;d NEVER see that now. If we are lucky, we might see a name actress have her head CGI&apos;d (ironic) onto a body double. But usually, the MPAA would go completely nuts and give the film an R or NC-17 rating.\n\nSome things are dated, such as tape-reading computers and big hair on the women- SO 1980&apos;s. But the film&apos;s concepts hold up pretty well.",

As the protagonist, Faye Grant is attractive but perhaps too hard-edged, coming across as slightly too old for this part. It doesn&apos;t help any that she&apos;s not exactly a gifted actress. In fact, she&apos;s terrible. (When she tries to display anger or frustration, she tends to yell her lines in a manner one might expect from a community theatre. Though to be honest, the dialogue is often phony enough to fell even the most accomplished actress.) Tippi Hedren as her haughty mother is utterly wasted. Barry Von Dyke is quite a hunk and comes across as personable, while Leslie Nielsen is featured in a rare dramatic role. This isn&apos;t the type of movie to watch when you expect top-quality acting, direction, etc. - you watch pretty people have easily-solved problems - but the whole shebang, while rated PG and ostensibly a feature film release, comes across as earnest but unbelievably bland, with characters whiter than a loaf of Wonder bread, and production values no better than a TV movie. Recommended only for those whose tastes run towards the Hallmark Channel.",

I know 2 of you for sure.\n\nAs the director of this documentary it was very important for me to reflect well on the story of the Mustafa family, while also giving enough background and history as I could, on the Kurdish people. The toughest challenge in that, is to tell an objective and uplifting story, without crossing over into something I would&apos;ve considered more run of the mill, and canned. At the end of the day, I chose to focus on the positive, while as creatively as I could, weave in a spiritual journey with music, poetry and stock footage.\n\nRecently at a film festival in London a great question was posed about Kissinger&apos;s involvement in the Iraqi conflict dating back to the 70&apos;s, that inevitably affected the Kurds, and I thought it was a good point...the documentary could have gone that route. Still, I thought about that, and it occurred to me, those type of points are what I might have done in a documentary about Kurdish history, and though I often wanted to touch on the &quot;war&quot; of current, and the path leading to it, it&apos;s just not what I set out to do. When I originally decided to pursue this story, I wanted to paint a portrait of a true American Hero, and to show the human struggle, back story and plight of those we look up to with such honor. Plus, I wanted to share a story of my friend, Herro, whose family has lived inspiring lives! I have really enjoyed the travel, friends and wonderful experiences in producing and promoting American Herro, and hope you&apos;ll consider renting, purchasing or watching the program (on PBS) in the near future.\n\nThanks, Kirk Roos",

Overall I thought that the story was pretty good. I really felt for abigail&apos;s character. She is always so great in everything she does. I also heard that she was a joy to be around, so that probably helped too! This films progression was done really well. The character development was awesome!

As Ellen straddles Lawrence, look real close and you&apos;ll see that she doesn&apos;t have any panties on. That&apos;s right. No panties on the lady. Then notice the surprised look on the face of Lawrence as they begin to have sex. A look of surprise and then a smile as he looks at her.\n\nNow, you decide whether the sex was real or they were acting. When I first saw this scene, I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. No doubt in my mind as to what happened. Don&apos;t believe me? Rent the tape and grab your remote and hit the pause button as she settles down on top of him."

I know this because I was a student there at the time of filming. Even on of my editing teachers was involved with this project. They used the Cumberland river as the Amazon and most of the so called jungle scenes was filmed at Percy Warner Park. All the students were hoping for a screening of this movie when it was done at the college but apparently it was so bad that they refused to show it. I looked for years for a copy of this and then finally found it on the Roku. The film is incoherent and half of the filmed scenes are out of focus. I&apos;m assuming that Robert Carradine and Michael Winslow did this movie for the free Nashville hot chicken because it looks like nothing else was available.",

      "reviewBody": "SKIPPY (Paramount, 1931), directed by Norman Taurog, which has nothing to do with a development of the peanut butter product, is a cute story based on the then popular comic strip character as portrayed by Jackie Cooper in a performance that earned this 10-year-old child actor an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Losing to one more than twice his age, Lionel Barrymore, for A FREE SOUL (MGM, 1931), SKIPPY did earn other nominations: Best Picture, Best Screenplay (Norman Taurog and Joseph L. Mankiewicz) and Best Director (Taurog, who won the honor that year).\n\nThe story opens in a small wholesome town where the camera sets focus on the Skinner household. There&apos;s Herbert Skinner (Willard Robertson), a town physician, his wife, Ellen (Enid Bennett), and their little boy they call &quot;Skippy&quot; (Jackie Cooper). Getting ready for breakfast. Mr. Skinner calls for his son to get out of bed and dressed. As he is calling, the camera then pans upstairs into Skippy&apos;s bedroom where the boy is still in bed, pretending to be putting on his clothes lazily asking his parents downstairs which shirt to put on. After heading down for breakfast, Skippy is visited by the neighborhood kids, Sidney (Jackie Searle), an obnoxious tattle-taler, and his sister, Eloise (Mitzi Greene) who takes the time to recite a poem, &quot;In Memory of a Dead Dog.&quot; Later, Skippy, who spends his free time in a &quot;swell&quot; district known as Shantytown, located on the opposite side of the tracks where poor people live, meets and befriends another boy called Sooky (Robert Coogan). At first Skippy wants to fight him, but when Sooky stands his ground, they become instant friends. Their day consists of innocent fun that lands them into trouble when they accidentally break the windshield of the mean Mr. Nubbins (Jack Clifford) car, whose profession is dog catcher. Later, Mr. Nubbins takes away Sooky&apos;s dog, Penny, for not having a license, placing the animal in the pound. Sooky is able to retrieve the dog, only if he comes up with a $3 fine for the license. With Skippy&apos;s help, they do, but Nubbins takes the money to replace his broken windshield, forcing the boys to come up with an additional $3 by 3 p.m. in order to get Penny, or else she&apos;ll have to &quot;be destroyed.&quot; The boys attempt to get that extra cash first by getting some money from Skippy&apos;s piggy bank, collecting empty bottles, doing errands, selling lemonade and putting on a show for the neighborhood kids. While the boys successfully raise the money, the unexpected occurs. Skippy soon finds himself resenting his father, who not only warned him to stay away from Shantytown, but has looked down towards those the people whom Skippy finds to be just plain ordinary folks as he and his parents are, with the exception of having more money than they do. As with most family movies, and later TV sit-coms, there&apos;s a moral lesson here to be learned. In this instance, rather than the children, it&apos;s learned by the parents, particularly Skippy&apos;s.\n\nFeatured in the supporting cast are Guy Oliver as &quot;Dad&quot; Burkey; Donald Haines as Harley Nubbins and Helen Jerome-Eddy as Sooky&apos;s widowed mother, among others. Eddy, a familiar face with sad expressions in many movies of the 1930s, is quite believable and natural as Sooky&apos;s struggling poor mother.\n\nSKIPPY is a cute, simple, funny and heartwarming story focusing solely on children, something quite rare for that time, with the exception of comedy shorts featuring Hal Roach&apos;s Our Gang (or The Little Rascals). To enjoy this sort of tale about the true loyalty and friendship between two boys is to really love and understand children. Movies such as SKIPPY could also be related by those who had grown up in such an bygone era. Director Norman Taurog presents the children, not just its stars, as normal every day innocent kids. SKIPPY could very well been set in any time frame, any location, whether during the Tom Sawyer era of the 1800s, or pre or post World War I. In other words, kids will always be kids.\n\nAside from Jackie Cooper&apos;s fine performance, ranging from conniving, gentle and extremely tearful in that one climatic scene between him and his Dad, there is Robert (&quot;Bobby&quot;) Coogan, the younger brother of Jackie Coogan, whose days as a top child star, which began in the early 1920s, were just about ending. Cute as he is natural, little Bobby Coogan comes very close in upstaging Cooper. So successful was SKIPPY, Paramount turned out an immediate sequel, SOOKY (1931) with the majority of the cast, minus Mitzi Green, reprising their roles.\n\nUnseen for many years, both SKIPPY and SOOKY were resurrected during the early years of cable television&apos;s U.S.A. cable network way past the midnight hours around 1987 before turning up again on Retroplex in August 2010, and Turner Classic Movies where it premiered February 22, 2011.\n\nRegardless of its age, SKIPPY is still timely, thanks to a literate script. For comedy, it delivers, For serious moments, it doesn&apos;t hold back. The crying scenes cannot actually be viewed without shedding at least one tear of emotion. As young as both Cooper and Coogan are, or were, they have presented themselves as real professional actors, or in better terms, common every day kids pretending to be somebody else, that as Skippy and Sooky.

      "reviewBody": "Whilst on holiday in Switzerland to compete in winter sports the Lawrence family inadvertently meet a spy who is killed in front of them.  He passes information to them relating to an assassination but, before they can pass on the information their daughter is kidnapped for their silence.  Back in London they decide to start looking for the kidnappers and prevent the assassination themselves.\n\nHitchcock&apos;s strength here is that an wholly unlikely plot which is full of holes is masked by a sense of wit and good feeling that covers the flaws. The whole thing falls down under scrutiny and as a thriller it doesn&apos;t really cut it as well as I&apos;d hoped  it certainly doesn&apos;t compare to The 39 Steps.  However the film is very classy and very, very British.\n\nI expect to American audiences nowadays that the very polite gentleman like approach of the film is very strange but it works quite well.  The final shoot out lacks excitement simply because it is unrealistic in the extreme but it&apos;s still quite enjoyable and has it&apos;s moments.  Lorre is good as the villain but lacks the smarmy qualities he brought to later films.  Leslie Banks is very good as the solid British hero and Best is good as his sassy (if underused) wife.  Wakefield has a good comedy role as Banks&apos; side kick.\n\nOverall the age of the film means it feels very stagy and very stiff but there&apos;s still much to enjoy with good settings, comedy and vintage Hitchcockian touches."

      "reviewBody": "Nerio is a powerful billionaire who owns the majority shareholder of the W Group. He adopts a boy named Largo and kept it secret from others. The idea was to take over Nerio&apos;s position one day. Unfortunately, Nerio was murdered by his enemies. Largo returns to home after a long time to find his father&apos;s killers.\n\nIt&apos;s an action packed thriller movie that has all the ingredients to satisfy action movie lovers. The Largo&apos;s character looks more realistic and sharp when compared with other one man show movie characters. German star Tomer Sisley portraits the role of Largo. This film uses multiple languages like English, French and sometimes Croatian. The film is filled with spectacular stunts and some breathtaking chase scenes which makes it a watchable movie. Still, I recommend this movie and somehow it manages to satisfy my expectations.",

      "reviewBody": "Christopher Rocket (Jimmy Fallon) returns home after news that his father is dying. Home is Florida, where he was raised by his emotionally-abusing, distant and womanizing father (Tom Arnold) and his soon-to-be-hippie and emotionally-abused mother (Sharon Stone). Home is not where the heart is.\n\nWe have many flashbacks of the out-of-whack dynamics of Chris&apos;s childhood. Most of which weren&apos;t need, primarily because these are good actors, so we only needed a scene or two to see that Chris never got the love and support that he should have.\n\nChris as an adult is an emotionally-distant and cynical young man. His beautiful girlfriend Anne (Lucy Liu), beautiful on the inside and out, thinks he can grow up, accept his parents and then enter into a mature and committed relationship with her if he has a heart-to-heart with his father in the hospital. You know, the father who&apos;s in a coma and the one who has never said a meaningful word to his son in his entire life - oh, how naive some supporting characters can be. The almost brilliantly funny scene of Chris attempting a conversation with his father in the hospital only landed him in jail. Maturity will have to come later.\n\nThis is Jimmy Fallon playing a very sullen man in a drama-comedy that is mostly drama. Almost completely drama with a lot of slow scenes building up to emotionally-abusive results which we already knew from previous slow scenes building up to emotionally-abusive results. These struggles with maturity have been seen before, either in other dysfunctional family dramedies or in the first few scenes or trailer of this film since they didn&apos;t have too much more to add, but &quot;The Year of Getting to Know Us&quot; is a pretty good film, well acted and with solid characters.",

If there was some free running involved I barely could make out what was happening because one of the gimmicks was the use of a shaky cam. Whose brilliant idea was that. People not knowing anything about free running must get the wrong impression about this extreme sports. As not single shot shows what free running really is. To top it of they mix in a Battle Royale game and Danny Dyer overacting like he never did before. Seriously I did give this movie a chance. But everything about it is just plain horrible.Avoid!"

      "reviewBody": "The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter.\n\nW. S. Van Dyke, MGM&apos;s peripatetic director, was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit. His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio). While considered a documentary at the time, we would likely term it a &apos;docudrama&apos; as it is scripted with an intriguing plot &amp; storyline.\n\nThe film shows the daily life of the Eskimo, both Winter &amp; Summer, and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight. The constant striving for food is depicted, and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus, polar bear, whale &amp; caribou. The native language is used throughout, with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen &amp; Mounties encountered by the Eskimo. In fact, it is the arrival of White Men, both good &amp; bad, and the change they make on Eskimo society, which is a major element in the narrative.\n\nThis Pre-Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code, particularly with their practice of wife-sharing, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930&apos;s.\n\nNone of the cast receives screen credit, which is a shame as there are some notable performances. Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise, playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue acting, using the name of Ray Mala, in a sporadic film career, often in tiny unbilled roles.\n\nLovely Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala&apos;s loyal second wife; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector. The two decent-hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer &amp; Edgar Dearing, both longtime movie character actors. Danish author Peter Freuchen, upon whose books the film was based, has a short vivid role of an evil wooden-legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala&apos;s icy wrath.",

In real life car racing, there is no dramatic love story, no struggle between good and evil, no rebel against the authority. In real life, racing is all about speed, physical strength, and concentration, anything else is just distraction.\n\n Rather than put in a third rate plot to make a crappy story out of it like Driven or any other racing flick has done(including the Grand Prix), Steve McQueen&apos;s Le Mans has chosen to walk the different path, to bring the true spirit of car racing on the big screen. Who cares if there is no plot, no conversation, or no love story. If you are looking for those things, you are watching the wrong movie. The sound of the 917 blast down the Mulsanne at full throttle is well worth the time to watch this movie.\n\n Sadly, this is probably the last of the true racing movies. The world today is impossible to make a movie out of real racing car(every single race car in Le Mans is real. The Porsche 917, the Ferrari 512S, The Lola T70). Driven uses mock CART car based on Indy Light, plus a whole lot of crappy CGI car, Grand Prix uses the F2 car that looks like the F1 at the time. A movie like Le Mans probably will never be made again.",

None of the other actors playing him in the later movies quite reaches his level - they are, of course, also working with scripts not even half as good as this one.\n\nThe movie in itself explores the difficult feelings of an agent infiltrating and more or less becoming part of a terrorist organisation. Their methods may be ugly, yes even horrible. But the purpose of their actions? It&apos;s action with a nice enough twist, making it entertaining AND interesting.",

Paradise Regained is like Kamen Rider OOO&apos;s 10th anniversary-a sequel that complements the show and reunites the cast many years later. However, I liked what they did with Faiz much more. The fight scenes were better, but there were some downsides, like why make it almost an hour long? The same thing happened with OOO&apos;s anniversary. Paradise Regained did have better action, though, and I liked the new suits and effects more. As for character development, it was there, but the movie should&apos;ve been longer. The pacing felt off to me. Other than that, it checks almost all the boxes for a Kamen Rider movie, and it also feels a bit more adult-oriented than the show.",

As the film progresses we watch as her life goes from one of normalcy to one on the fringes of &quot;normal&quot; society, and its a course mirrored by her sex life. It is a very lurid film that pretty much covers every sexual subject you can think of, and probably some you can&apos;t. Its a well made movie that is so close to being an explicit film that one wonders why they didn&apos;t bother to go all the way and not shy away from showing it all. But its not really about the sex, since this is a smutty film that has the belief that its about something other than just showing hot sweaty sex. I&apos;m not sure if thats true or not. Actually I&apos;m not sure what I think of this film. frankly its one of those movies that you see and aren&apos;t enthused by, but which you find yourself haunted by none the less. There is something about the film that keeps me wondering if its not better than I think it is. Then again it maybe the desire to see the hot sweaty sex again (It really is steamy)\n\nIf you&apos;re not prudish and ready to deal with sex in all of its varieties then by all means dive in and give it a try. If you are offended by anything other than straight forward heterosexual sex, then stay away.",

      "reviewBody": "Had one failed diplomatic initiative during the Civil War succeeded, could it have changed all of history? Perhaps. Kevin Willmott&apos;s chilling and somewhat plausible alternate history of America was so well produced that even its exceedingly unlikely and prejudiced retelling of the 20th century passes with a bit of artistic license. It assumes, wrongly, that America is a country completely without any virtue, a view to be rejected outright. Assumptions about a Confederate Empire, chattel slavery spread unimpeded and unchallenged throughout the Americas, a ridiculous notion of a &quot;Cotton Curtain&quot; cold war with Canada just don&apos;t add up. It could not have evolved that way. Nonetheless, the alternate 19th century history is utterly fascinating. Had Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin succeeded in getting European powers to fight for the Confederacy, what would America look like today? \n\nEven with its terribly cynical and often unfair view of America, I admit I couldn&apos;t stop thinking about this film.",

The first assessment here I found odd, because the problems is treated by the parents, but this not the center point is.

Amid the babble of English, French and German tourists, Hulot tries to reconcile the old-fashioned ways with the confusion of the encroaching age of technology.\n\n\n\nThe first time I saw it was on a video tape with lousy quality\n\nand the second time was on Criterion Collection and I thought it was great BUT why could not it be a little bit more funny????????? Then the third time I understand it:It´s ART. You can watch it how many times you want and  still find new things in the film.\n\nAlso I saw how expensive it was to make.Jacques Tati must have build up a whole town because the set is so fantastic BIG!!!!\n\nBut when Monsieur Hulot  comes to the nightclub it gets the same old hilarious Tati.\n\nRating: 5/5 Some day I hope that I will see this in 70 mm but untill then Criterion Collection is a good choice!!!!!",

It completely grabs your attention, from the opening credits, while Michael Biehn (who is excellent in his stalker role) is typing a letter to Lauren Bacall, underscored by Pino Donaggio&apos;s effective music. Bacall and Stapleton have tremendous chemistry, and their characters are utterly believable. So too, are the musical numbers which Bacall performs, during the film. Singer or not, Bacall was quite successful in musicals on Broadway, and the songs in the film, are the type she would have performed. Dialog appears unscripted and completely natural, particularly between Bacall and Stapleton. James Garner and Hector Elizondo, are solid in their supporting roles. This film is a favorite of mine.

It was a great opportunity to symbolically restore the friendly relations between Germany and other nations. However, the emissaries of this consent were the bobsleigh teams formed of men who hated one another from early childhood, had very bad manners and certain family problems that they happened to bring along.\n\nThough the first half of the movie is slightly boring, from the point when our heroes arrive at Oslo the real comedy starts with a variety of misunderstandings and embarrassing situations.\n\nIt&apos;s probably not a very faithful representation of how the real events looked like, but it&apos;s really enjoyable to watch the plot with some crazy twists and turns to be built on a real story. There is of course a message in the movie. It&apos;s not exactly about friendship, but definitely showing the value of agreeing to do something together against the odds for some greater cause.\n\nAnd for sure I have never before and never after laughed so hard during an epilogue."

      "reviewBody": "A nice and very sentimental film about love and live in Tokyo displayed before the background of a power failure on the night of Dec 23rd in Tokyo. The theme is not new, nor is the implementation in the form of intertwining story lines. Despite the obvious lack of new ideas the result is quite pleasing. What you can expect are a set of nicely displayed characters acting in a calm atmosphere of people suddenly coming to rest from there busy lives due the breakdown of public live after the power failure. Unlike contemporary American movies there are few melodramatic moments. The stories told do not really climax and typical for Japanese storytelling have an ambivalent ending with only one happy end and some open threads, which are up for the audience to conclude. Characters displayed are a nice sample of Tokyo life, having so much in common with the people I meet every day in this crazy town that I felt immediately comfortable with the setting. The acting is good, which in this case means it is hardly noticeable and the characters are very believable. Every character in the movies has to clean up a bit of his love life, finally realizing that relationships have ended, accepting facts of live that have changed or tying up threads of live from a remote past. We are mostly told about old love and shattered illusions. New love is only hinted on and it adds to the overall mood of the film that the audience is left to imagine where it might lead to.\n\nI watched the the film on a flight back from Tokyo on Dec 23rd, which is the day of the year the plot of the film is supposed to take place on. Being in a bit of a sentimental Christmas mood the film did not fail to show the intended effect on me.",

      "reviewBody": "Garringo is directed by Rafael Romero Marchent and Marchent co- writes the screenplay with Giovanni Scolaro. It stars Anthony Steffen, Peter Lee Lawrence, Solvi Stubbing, Jose Bodalo and Raf Baldassarre. Music is by Marcello Giombini and cinematography by Aldo Ricci.\n\nJohnny as a very young boy witnesses the murder of his father by a soldier, he grows up to be a double life leading killer of soldiers. Enter a man to hunt him down, Lieutenant Garringo.\n\nThis Is Bells City - You Better Return If You Don&apos;t Hear It.\n\nA most interesting Pasta Western because although the narrative doesn&apos;t have ambitions to expand thematically, there&apos;s psychological depth to the principal bad boy. He&apos;s scarred by the murder of his father and has become a twisted callous killer, yet he&apos;s still capable of hiding his dark half so as to exude as a dandy caring type. That said, pic is more interested in the straight forward conventions of a driven hunter hunting down his prey, to which we have a cool Steffen and a schizophrenic Lawrence acting accordingly.\n\nSincerely Johnny.\n\nProduction crams in genre staples, both traditional American and Spaghetti, so we get camera shenanigans involving canted angles, zooms, close-ups et al. Plenty of violence resides, though some is done down by poor choreography (could the punches be any further from the targets?), and action is in no short supply (great hold-ups and the usual shoot-outs). The locations are most pleasing, which in turn are backed by a nifty musical score that&apos;s big on jaunty woodwinds and menacing strings.\n\nA maniac who has to have a gun to be a man!\n\nWith both leading characters showing dexterity to marry up with their respective killing traits, it&apos;s a film underpinned by both, ensuring this is worth a watch. Hardly a genre classic, mind, but enough here to have a good time with. 6.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Pumuckl is an outstanding TV show for children, funny, entertaining and well written. But it is not only for children, but also for grown ups. I am 20 years old and still watch Pumuckl when possible. Children will like Pumuckl&apos;s jokes and funny speech, grown ups will realize funny things that as a child one would not understand. For example Meister Eder having a beer with his buddies, talking as if it was a show made for a much older audience. And I am not saying they talk about sexual stuff, just things a child would not pay any attention to, whereas an adult will smile at every single line. \n\nAlso very outstanding is the great amount of Bavarian actors and guest actors, for example Gustl Bayrhammer, Ernie Singerl, Toni Berger, Karl Obermayr and many others. Not to mention Hans Clarin as the voice of Pumuckl, who is (was) the only real voice talent in Germany, in my opinion. I doubt that this show and the radio dramas would have been the successes they were, if it had not been for him. One cannot describe Pumuckls voice, it is beyond any normal one. It neither sounds like a child, nor like an adult, it is neither male nor female, just weird and a bit shrill. There is no comparison to it, just like to this show. Watch it, it is more than worth it.",

      "name": "Good Early Effort From Bruckheimer . Could Have Been Slightly Better",
      "reviewBody": "Immediately after the Great War 1914-18 Major Foster an American born officer in the French Foreign Legion . A disillusioned man who has seen more than enough of the horrors of war , Foster looks forward to more peaceful times only to hear of a spreading insurrection led by El Krim , a Beeber warlord who wants to liberate Morroco from French rule and Foster is sent to put down the insurrection \n\nThis is an early production from Jerry Bruckheimer who in the 1980s went on to be the most successful commercial film producer in Hollywood . His films included BEVERLEY HILLS COP , FLASHDANCE and TOP GUN . His films were rarely a hit with critics but what he was very good at was mixing aspects to gain maximum publicity for movies and fill multiplexes . Who can forget Eddie Murphy driving along LA with The Heat Is On blasting out in the foreground or or boys and girls flocking to the cinema in equal numbers to see Tom Cruise fall in love and shoot down enemy jets after which the audience would buy the official soundtrack album . Studios are only interested in profit margins and if a film makes a ton of money then who cares if it didn&apos;t win an Oscar ? You have to admit Bruckheimer was always excellent at whta he did \n\nMARCH OR DIE shows early signs at what the producer was trying to achieve - make a film that would appeal to the action adventure market while still appealing to critics . It&apos;s interesting during this early period of his career Bruckheimer still might have wanted to win an Oscar for Best Film . THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO. and FAREWELL MY LOVELY both directed by Dick Richards are two very impressive films from The New Hollywood period and you can see in this film a mix of character exploration and big battle action sequences \n\nThe problem is that it doesn&apos;t quite come off . You can see Gene Hackman, Major Foster as a tortured man with ghosts from the past realising the only way to lay his demons to rest is via Catherine Deneuve&apos;s Mme Picard but the film concentrate too much on Terence Hill&apos;s Marco to make this possible . Hill effectively plays the comic acrobatic character which he was best known for in the Italian Westerns alongside Bud Spencer and Marco - unlike Foster - never comes across as a real life character . Likewise the rest of the characters who join the Legion are entirely one dimensional clichés \n\nTwo things that do work is firstly El Krim the noble but superstitious leader . In 1977 the average Westerner would have little reaction to the word &quot; Muslim &quot; one way or another . Certainly El Krim is the villain of the story but he&apos;s written and played by Iah Holm as someone who fears progress rather than someone who just wants to slaughter Infidels . You wouldn&apos;t get a Muslim baddie like this in a movie nowadays . Secondly the long awaited battle sequence when it does come certainly doesn&apos;t disappoint \n\nIn summary MARCH OR DIE is a historical epic that that tries to appeal to everyone at the same time while never consistently appealing to anyone . That said is rather impressive in parts but you do feel slightly upset that the movies can&apos;t sustain it over the whole course of the movie and it does contain a lot of dross",

      "reviewBody": "The leading figure in Factotum (which means a jack of all trades) is Henry Chinaski. The movie, written and directed by Bent Hamer, a Norwegian, is based on the novel of the same name by Charles Bukowski, who died in 1994. Like Chinaski, Bukowski was a drunk, indulged in casual sex, and liked to gamble; and most of Bukowski&apos;s books, including Factotum, are based on his own experiences in and out of blue collar worker. Also, like his creator, Chinaski is a writer, albeit unpublished as yet. Nevertheless, it is probably best NOT to approach this film as a partial biography of Bukowski, but simply as a fictional movie based on his writings.\n\nChinaski, played by Matt Dillon, is the ultimate, irresponsible goof-off, living just above the level of skid row, who gets work when he needs cash for booze etc, but invariably gets fired within days or weeks. Told not to smoke in a particular workplace, he lights up once the boss is out of the way; asked to make a delivery, he drives the van away while it&apos;s still connected to an electric plug, leaves the van door open and drifts into a bar. Even outside work, he behaves perversely - notably leaving ointment on his private parts overnight, when he&apos;s been told that one hour is the absolute limit! And Chinaski, though initially appearing mildly passive, is not averse to violence, even to women.\n\nThe man&apos;s sole redeeming features are his belief in himself as a writer, and his persistence in writing and submitting his work. (His main redeeming feature should be his actual talent for writing, but the film gives us little evidence of this, except for a few Bukowski quotes, which in any case are mainly about his belief in himself.) .\n\nDillon fits this role like a glove. By turns, he sleepwalks, staggers and rampages through the movie - that is, when Chinaski isn&apos;t drinking in bars or sleeping it off with or without a woman. And, because this is fiction rather than biography, Dillon can mitigate his deplorable behaviour and slovenly dress simply with his good looks and dark eyes. One suspects that in real life Bukowski was far less likable than his cinematic alter ego.\n\nChinaski&apos;s main squeeze for most of the movie, bravely and quite unglamorously portrayed by Lili Taylor, is Jan who shares her lover&apos;s fondness for alcohol and a slacker life. In one sequence, when he has split from Jan, Chinaski encounters a glossier woman, Laura (Marisa Tomei), who introduces him to a more bourgeois world; but this doesn&apos;t last long, and he soon reverts to his usual round of drink and casual jobs. (Incidentally, I found the sound quality in the whole Marisa Tomei sequence quite poor, and missed much of the dialogue.)\n\nI&apos;m not too sure what anybody uninterested in Bukowski (or Matt Dillon) will make of this movie; but if you&apos;re looking for somjething in English other than blockbusters, rom-coms, costume dramas etc - this is it. And, whatever your view of the movie, if you haven&apos;t already done so, read some Bukowski - you&apos;ll love it!",

The documentary charts the history of US exploitation films from the beginnings of cinema to the modern day.\n\nIt was Tarantino and Rodriguez that revitalised the term Grindhouse when they made their double feature but it took off in the 1960s with the change of mores and loosening of censorship laws.\n\nIt allowed filmmakers to exploit and challenge an area of cinema that was designed for discerning adults that like terror, sex, violence and buckets of blood.\n\nThe documentary is narrated by Robert Forster and interviews starts, directors and fans of the genre including Joe Dante, John Landis, Fred Williamson, Larry Cohen, William Lustig, Lewis Teague and others.\n\nHowever it is not just talking heads, you have clips from grindhouse films and especially a good representation of clips from films of the 1960s and 70s.",

And he brought it into class for all of us to see.  Now this movie has a cast of all children and so my drama teacher was like 12 when he did this.  When my class watched it they were all laughing out loud with all the crazy things (i.e. &quot;magic harmonica&quot; that freezes bad guys) some parts are long and over drawn but over all this is a crazy movie for the whole family and any one in the cast that wants to contact Barry Dalainy can do so by me but. If you can find a copy rent it!!!!!",

This is a great flick, lots of suspense, some gore, and a twist at the end.\n\nI have no doubt this flick inspired movies like &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot; with it&apos;s emphasis on evil, illusions and nightmares that come to life.\n\nVery hard to find, but it&apos;s well worth.\n\nOliver Stone can do it all."

I understand that Picard and Data are seen as the most popular characters in the Next Generation that appeal to the general public, but the story lines that get played out for the two of them in the movies (family and finding humanity) have already been done in the series.\n\nThose two themes - Picard&apos;s family and Data&apos;s quest for humanity - are central parts of this film, and take up a lot of the time, but the other characters do get their moments, and being the gracious professionals that they are, Frakes, Sirtis, McFadden, Burton and Dorn all give fabulous performances. Whoopi Goldberg appears unbilled as Guinan, and Patti Yasutaki also appears as Nurse Ogawa.\n\n&quot;Generations&quot; also features three members of the Original Trekers, Captain Kirk, Scotty and Chekov, the latter two in small roles, while Kirk has a much larger role, yet his scenes, alongside Picard, are the slowest and most boring part of the film, even if they are confronting the enemy together.\n\nOne of the enemies in &quot;Generations&quot; is a mad man, well played by Malcolm McDowell, the others are the two Klingon sisters who appeared towards the end of the Next Generation series, and make welcome appearances once more. Also watch for Jacqueline Kim as the daughter of Sulu from the Original Series.\n\nThis is a decent film, but like all Next Generation films, can be quite repetitive and leaves some of the cast (particularly the lovely McFadden) with little to do.",

      "name": "The American substitutes outlandish action for a vacuous yet restrained dramatic thriller.",
      "reviewBody": "It was only a matter of time before I watched this. A film hated by audiences for its misrepresenting marketing and rarely discussed amongst cinephiles due to its style over substance. The plot is vacuous no question, and struggles to fill up its runtime. However, as a character study, I believe Corbijn&apos;s minimalistic approach to be incredibly nuanced and tasteful. A contract killer on the run is temporarily residing in the Italian countryside where he has one final task to pull off for a client, to which he meets a woman he is romantically interested in.\n\nThe editing for the film cleverly lures viewers in, with one of two short shootouts being shown right at the start. This immediately sets a precedent for action, or perhaps stylish spy shenanigans. Once Clooney&apos;s silent but deadly protagonist finds his way stuck in the beautiful town of Castelvecchio, Corbijn slows the pace down to a grinding halt. Every action, destination or conversation is shown through Ruhe&apos;s gorgeous minimalistic cinematography. Ten minutes can be spent just following Clooney down a street, edited only to change camera positions. For some, this will be a major deterrent that will force many to turn off before reaching the halfway mark.\n\nHowever, upon reflection, Corbijn&apos;s deliberate slow pace makes sense. He attempts to thematically convey the loneliness of this contract killer, inevitably disposing of those who grow attached to him. One could argue that mainstream spy flicks like &apos;Casino Royale&apos; convey this through spectacular extravaganza, yet The American opts for an arthouse approach. Does it achieve the same results? In a way, yes. The biggest problem with this film is the lack of plot. It becomes overbearing at times that nothing is actually happening and is unable to evoke any characterisation or engrossing dialogue, but still remains intriguing thanks to the rural scenery and Clooney&apos;s nuanced performance.\n\nIt&apos;s peculiar, and a film that has lingered on my mind for some time now. It&apos;s unfortunately too empty to be a flawed masterpiece, leading me to look at my watch on various occasions, but certainly doesn&apos;t deserve the resentment that it has received. Technically meticulous yet unable to escape the all too common &quot;style over substance&quot; trait.",

This has to be one of the better sci-fi movies I&apos;ve seen.\n\nImagine it, you traveling across the continent to a safe-haven - the ONLY one left on Earth.  Your transportation; a shoddy-looking bus with others, crammed like sardines.  Your obstacles; everything.  From crazed bandits to violent solar storms, this leaves you imagining yourself in place of one of the characters on that bus.  Quite a thrill, isn&apos;t it?\n\nFood is heavily rationed, medical aid is meager, and death is engulfing. Great, great setup for a storyline (which could have been better in several ways, although I&apos;m fine with it as-is)."

He/she completely missed the point. There&apos;s so much more to this movie, watching it was of great joy and delight for me.\n\nIt gives an honest, simple and raw account of Sarajevo realities back in the 1960s, when it was an expanding city in Tito&apos;s Yugoslavia. &apos;Dolly Bell&apos; offers many memorable snapshots that it uses as setting: teenagers mimicking Adriano Celentano, audiences watching &apos;Rome by night&apos;, couples with children dreaming of moving into new housing complexes built by the communist government, lunches with extended family members, community center struggling to buy instruments for their band.....etc, etc. And all this while the main character Dino (played by Kusturica&apos;s favourite Slavko Stimac) is finding his way through adolescence.\n\nBasically, the movie is Kusturica&apos;s and Sidran&apos;s love letter to their respective childhoods, which happened to take place during an interesting time in Yugoslav history not too long after World War II when the country was being rebuilt under new social order and a tangible sense of excitement of participating in something good and worthy was felt amongst certain sections of its population.\n\nKusturica would of course go on to make much more serious and challenging films later in his career, but this one shows his ability to successfully deal with simple stories that are not driven by big, complex ideas and don&apos;t have an instantly dramatic setting."

From the very first sight, the professor irrevocably accepts the rental conditions! A triangular relationship settles quickly between 1) an intellectual sensitive to beauty and youth, 2) a desperate widow impressed by this professor, both unable to fight against theirs own obsessive desires, and 3) a manipulative and nonchalant teen. Consecutively to a fatal accident and because of the inquisitive and invasive look of Clare Quilty, the teacher will progressively and ineluctably descend in the depths of the abyss.\n\nJames Mason is awesome and monumental. He is also excellently seconded by Sue Lyon, Peter Sellers and Shelley Winters. And Stanley Kubrick is definitely a regular of successful and even improved literary adaptations, with Shining (1980), 2001, A space odyssey (1968), Barry Lyndon (1975), A clockwork orange (1971), The Killing (1956), ...\n\nThis movie is truly a masterpiece."

      "name": "An accessible and lightweight French comedy featuring everyone&apos;s favourite Audrey Tautou",
      "reviewBody": "Love seems especially beautiful when it happens in France, doesn&apos;t it? We&apos;ve all imagined ourselves as the beautiful people headlining French movies like Amelie (2001), A Very Long Engagement (2004) and Priceless (2006). Is it just coincidence that the above-mentioned movies feature French cinema&apos;s darling Audrey Tautou? Here we have another romantic comedy starring the lovely starlet and her pixie crop.\n\nTautou plays Emilie (probably paying homage to Amelie, the character which made the French star a household name), an owner of a hairdressing salon who receives a hand written love letter from a shy handyman. She dismisses the passionate letter at first, but when she realises that her mother is still distraught over the betrayal of her father, she decides to resend the letter to cheer the upset woman up. What follows is a series of misunderstandings and an awkward love triangle involving a man caught between two women who are mother and daughter. \n\nThis is your usual French charmer, with a tried and test romantic comedy formula. You&apos;d be chuckling instead of roaring in laughter at the setups and the occasional sexual innuendos, you&apos;d be impressed with yourself (yet again) because you could see the ending coming one quarter into the 105 minute movie, and you&apos;d have no problem sitting through this lightweight and accessible production where everyone, well, is a charmer.\n\nWe are talking about the caricatured characters here, ranging from Tautou&apos;s smart alec but lovable protagonist, Nathalie Baye&apos;s (Catch Me If You Can) mother character who seems a little too hungry for sex, Sami Bouajia&apos;s (Days of Glory) handsome handyman, and other supporting roles written to provide additional laughs. This isn&apos;t exactly a bad thing though - the people in the world written by scriptwriter Benoit Graffin may lead everyday lives like ours, but there is something particularly charismatic about how they appear on screen. This makes us common folks desire for a lifestyle like theirs, and that&apos;s probably why everyone loves French cinema. \n\nTautou and her signature bob does nothing new here, but still manages to have you siding with her idiosyncratic and quirky character. Baye steals the show as the mother whose love life is turned upside down after receiving a zealously written love letter. The actress manages to deliver a comical performance which provides the energy for the film. Bouajia isn&apos;t too bad either, as one can only imagine his frustration as he finds himself caught between two women. Supporting characters played by Stephanie Lagarde and Judith Chemla complete the likable ensemble cast. \n\nAs this isn&apos;t a sweeping romance drama, you can expect standard production values (read: simple cinematography and simple art direction) which are more commonly found on TV movies. This, also isn&apos;t a bad thing, because your attention should be on the character&apos;s jesting and bantering.\n\nDirector Pierre Salvadori, who also co penned the screenplay, is obviously hoping to repeat the success he enjoyed on Priceless five years ago, which also starred Tautou. A romantic comedy like this will be easily enjoyed by the masses, but it may also be conveniently filed into the category of &quot;one of those&quot; French comedies you&apos;ve watched before.\n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n",

I agree with the other poster here that the acting is phenomenal and the main actors in this movie truly shine as though they really are the characters they are playing in this film, 100% believable in their roles. Big congrats to the cast of this one for their great work. I only saw this by happenstance because my friend taped it on a cable channel years ago by mistake and we were looking for a tape to record a show while we were out and I said not to tape over this because it looked interesting, how about that? It&apos;s about the working class in England and seems to be very realistic about these hard working people who sometimes have very dangerous jobs they simply don&apos;t have any other choice of making a living. I am surprised never to have heard of this movie before but if you get a chance to watch it I would say check it out for sure if you are a fan of good acting :)",

Tricky. Ronald Harwood can write the ins and outs of theatrical life better than any living soul - remember &quot;The Dresser? - This is not any way near as good or as insightful but is charming and fun. Lilli Palmer played the part back in the 60&apos;s in &quot;Adorable Julia&quot; and she was adorable indeed as is Annette Bening in a tour de force performance with regular interruptions to give plenty of space to the trade mark Bening giggle. Shaun Evans plays the young man, the object of Julia&apos;s desire, her frustrating emotional holiday and I must admit, that&apos;s the one element that should have sizzle instead of fizzle. Shaun Evans is a good actor but it doesn&apos;t have anything that would make us understand the folly attraction that awakes in Julia. He plays an American but appears bland, as bland as a British actor can be when he&apos;s bland. I longed for a Billy Crudup or someone younger, a Brad Renfro. Can you imagine what the movie would have been like with a Heath Ledger in that part? Unless, of course, the whole thing was intentional to underline Julia&apos;s absurdity. An actress on the verge of a nervous break down. Comparasions with &quot;All About Eve&quot; are ridiculous. That would be like comparing &quot;One Flew Over The Cookoo&apos;s Nest&quot; with &quot;The Couch Trip&quot;",

I love the perfect precision Godard has over Piccoli. Evertime Picolli speaks, Godard interrupts and overwrites his information with with a more profound and articulate meaning - thus leaving Piccoli anxious and frustrated, this happens quite often - absolute genius.\n\nAlso, Its really funny to see the workers (of the place the documentary is set) getting asked about trivial information on the golden age of cinema - they literally don&apos;t have a clue. I know this is a reconstruction and you can obviously tell that it is staged but it reconstructs how ignorant some people are, only knowing names like Arnold Schwarzenegger &amp; Madonna and only hearing of films such as Pulp Fiction (because of its mainstream violence) and 9 1/2 Weeks (because of it&apos;s mainstream nudity) and how these films are publicised just because of their so-called content. This Documentary also tries to rule out the forgotten french cinema (golden-age that is) and it&apos;s true - Godard&apos;s part in the first 1/3 is worth seeing alone.\n\nbut overall, this was very interesting and anybody interested in french cinema (or cinema in general) should try and see this.",

The actor who played Billy Pilgrim captured Billy&apos;s passive, calm and vaguely anti-social demeanor. Lazarro, Montana and Billy&apos;s wife are also well played. \n\nGeorge Roy Hill had a knack for directing movies made from great books -- e.g., &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; -- and in the end, I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie turned out. \n\nAs far as the Vonnegut adaptations go (I know of four -- this one, &quot;Mother Night,&quot; &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; and the god-awful &quot;Slapstick&quot;) this one is the best of the bunch. \n\nI&apos;ve always wanted to see a movie version of &quot;Sirens of Titan,&quot; but it&apos;ll probably never happen -- so &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is my only chance to &quot;see&quot; Trafalmadore. \n\nRecommended to any true Vonnegut fans. Other people probably won&apos;t appreciate it.",

      "reviewBody": "Most of this Harold Lloyd feature consists of enjoyable low-key comedy, but it is capped off with a manic chase finale that is fun to watch. Aside from a handful of somewhat dated details, it holds up pretty well, and it has some good material. In &quot;Doctor Jack&quot;, Lloyd gets to play the kind of energetic, well-meaning character that he performed almost effortlessly.\n\nMost of the first half of the movie simply introduces the characters and presents a series of interactions between &quot;Doctor Jack&quot; and various persons in his hometown. It&apos;s pleasant and often pretty amusing, since there are a lot of subtle comic touches to go along with the rather broadly-played events. In the second half, the doctor takes on the &apos;invalid&apos; played by Mildred Davis, and from there things build up towards the finale.\n\nThe conference between &apos;Jack&apos; and the stuffy specialist is crafted nicely, and the climactic chase sequence is entertaining as long as you don&apos;t take it too seriously. In fact, by design it seems to get more and more ridiculous as it proceeds, until it is finally resolved in a clever way.\n\nThis doesn&apos;t have the memorable material or impressive set pieces of Lloyd&apos;s most celebrated movies, but it has a lot of amusing moments, and shows skill in a different way, by taking what is essentially one simple situation and using it for as much comedy as possible."

      "reviewBody": "Watchable version of the oft-filmed Victor Hugo tale: made by the same studio (Fox), it emerges as a wholly inferior remake of the superb 1935 version – which I reviewed earlier this month. Despite Milestone’s involvement, this one displays more surface gloss than genuine style – with the script itself being much more prosaic. Still, there’s an intermittent evidence of talent throughout – for instance, in the rather effective final shot which frames the mirror image of the protagonists between the all-important candlesticks; also worth noting is the score by Alex North which, particularly at the climax, feels like a dry run for his Oscar-nominated work on SPARTACUS (1960).\n\nMichael Rennie and Robert Newton are fine actors, but their performances here are no match for Fredric March and Charles Laughton in the earlier film; though Newton is remarkably restrained, his role has been somewhat diminished to accommodate the sappy romance involving Debra Paget and Cameron Mitchell! Besides, it’s compromised by the loss of two small but important scenes from the 1935 version which, in this case, robs the character of essential depth: a) when Javert is humiliated by his peers for his lowly background, and b) when he blackmails newly-appointed Mayor Jean Valjean, a former convict, in his office; unbelievably, it substitutes the first by having Javert’s own father serve a prison sentence on the galley to which he’s himself assigned!\n\nOther conceptual flaws include: Edmund Gwenn’s pivotal role of the Bishop, which comes off as whimsical alongside Cedric Hardwicke’s haunting turn in the earlier film; Valjean is depicted as an illiterate who receives schooling from the intellectual played by Joseph Wiseman (his Method approach feels out of place in a 19th century French setting!); Javert’s conscience-stricken demise here is, disconcertingly, brought about by his brief conversation with James Robertson Justice (as Valjean’s right-hand man); missing from the narrative, though, is the poignant character of Eponine (whose role gave a plausible melancholia to the romantic angle in the 1935 film).\n\nUltimately, I wouldn’t call the 1952 LES MISERABLES unnecessary, considering that it’s made with undeniable professionalism and the fact that countless other film versions have followed it; perhaps, the late eminent critic Leslie Halliwell summed it best in his claim that it’s “lacking the spark of inspiration”.",

      "reviewBody": "This film by Nicolas Roeg builds on the unusual titles of his past career (Don&apos;t Look Now; Walkabout; Performance) and adapts Lucy Irvine&apos;s book of her real-life experiences as a Girl Friday on a desert island.\n\nAmanda Donohoe reaches career-grabbing perfection as Irvine, the girl who answers an ad from lonely middle-aged businessman Gerald (a multi-faceted role for Oliver Reed) and goes to live with him in the tropical sun for a year. Roeg&apos;s film requires Donohoe to appear nude or semi-nude much of the time but it doesn&apos;t seem gratuitous. Not surprisingly it helped her gain other roles in the remainder of the decade as a ballsy, sexy siren.\n\nAs a two-hander for most of its running time, &apos;Castaway&apos; depends on the performances of its two leads - they have to be convincing, they have to be compelling, and they have to have chemistry. It isn&apos;t a match made in heaven - but as Gerald and Lucy learn to live with each other despite the obvious problems, the viewer is drawn in with them.\n\nOliver Reed is excellent as Gerald, a complex character who goes from bluster and rage to sweetness and sensitivity. It was something of a comeback role as the first part of the 1980s hadn&apos;t given him roles of any great depth to work with (neither did many films after this one), and he does well within the confines of Lucy Irvine&apos;s reminiscences.\n\nI particularly like the ending. Fact or fantasy? But it rounds off this atmospheric film beautifully.",

      "reviewBody": "I had a wonderful time attending the Regensburg preview of Beste Zeit. I was very worried that with only 4 months of German training and a total of only 7 months living in Bavaria, that i would have a massive problem understanding a lot of the humor throughout the film. Much to my surprise i found that the story was very easy to understand to an &quot;auslander&quot;. I&apos;m looking very forward to reading the subtitles on this movie when i watch it the second time, and i will definitely be recommending it to my Mum and sister. However, my boyfriend, who was with me at the premier, also enjoyed it very much, but i think that was mostly because of the Bavarian humor. He is also Bavarian. The relationships between the main character, Kati, and her friends and family surrounding her, are so understandable, and easy to relate to. They really have fantastic bonds, and these are explored quite well throughout the film. Apparently this is part of a trilogy set, and if that is true, i look forward to seeing how these relationships grow and grow.\n\nThere are little to no conflicts in the film, but i didn&apos;t find this to be a problem at all, as i enjoyed the uplifting nature completely. All in all, its a wonderful, romantic painting of the Bavarian countryside and its lovable inhabitants. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to travel to these remote parts of Germany, or even if you just feel like taking a holiday in your local independent cinema. It&apos;s just great.",

Valentin is the Amelie Poulin of the Latin younger set, and just as adorable as Kolya, the Cinema Paradiso kid, and the Life is Beautiful kid. And Buenos Aires is displayed beautifully in this movie. If only Valentin was in wider release in the States. No one knows about it, but many would enjoy this very charming, warm-hearted movie, that reminds us of the innocence of our own youth and how we tried to decipher and improve the world in our own small way."

      "reviewBody": "The Long Voyage Home (1940)\n\nAny movie with Gregg Toland behind the camera is worth watching, with an emphasis on the visual experience. From Wuthering Heights (1939) to the Little Foxes, Ball of Fire, and Citizen Kane (all 1941), in three years, Toland lifted (again) the standards of the best Hollywood could do. This isn&apos;t just me saying this, and of course there are other great cinematographers, but if you&apos;ve seen these movies you know they are exceptional. I falls right in the middle of this great stretch, and it has the revered John Ford directing, letting Toland do his thing, right from the first scene.\n\nThis is a solid, sometimes moving, sometimes dramatic movie, for sure. But the long first part is a composite of manly clichés: drinking, fighting, and womanizing. It&apos;s all in good fun, in a way, and the exoticness is made to sell movies. But there&apos;s quite a lot of nothing going on beyond seducing native women in some unnamed distant land. The dancing and fighting are filmed with Toland perfection, but it turns quickly to farce, or stereotype.\n\nThomas Mitchell is a lively Irishman in his best form, and John Wayne is an improbable Swede, and doesn&apos;t stand out much from the bunch except toward the end, when he is a block of wood with a bad accent. The story is a series of misunderstandings and friendships, but since the plot is made of four different Eugene O&apos;Neill plays (from 20 years earlier), there is a little discontinuity to it all.\n\nAll of this is set during that strange cusp between World War II beginning in Europe and the U.S. still not joining in. The ship is carrying ammunition, and hints of things that really matter are given right at the start, with some news reports crackling into the seeming isolation of the ship. As the captain says as they are to depart from New York with the military cargo, &quot;If it doesn&apos;t get there it&apos;ll be missed. But we won&apos;t.&quot;\n\nIsolationism gets a more famous treatment in Casablanca two years later, after the Americans are already at war, so in a way, a big name movie like this had more potential influence on American sentiment. It&apos;s fascinating to see this Walter Wanger/John Ford/John Wayne collaboration after their breakthrough Stagecoach the year before (producer, director, star). But the stakes are raised, and the production level is much higher.",

Part of it&apos;s&apos; focus is on one woman&apos;s return to the site her husband had died during the war.\n\nThe great strength of this film is it also speaks with Vietnamese women whose husbands were killed. Because their country experienced the war directly their stories are very different and more intense.\n\nLike other great films on war this clearly points out that one&apos;s pain of war never goes away. The war lives on in one&apos;s life forever. One woman recounted that she felt her husband&apos;s name should have been at the Vietnam Wall in Washington DC. He committed suicide seven years after the end of the war and the reasons&apos; were directly connected to Vietnam. Another woman&apos;s husband died from the effects of Agent Orange. In a recent commentary Canadian Romeo Dallaire, who has experienced Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, said that the number of suicides of Vietnam War veterans was far higher than the general population. He said these suicides would raise significantly the count of American war dead from Vietnam.",

Far, far better than today&apos;s huge budget craps that are released on DVD market, craps most of them from Eastern Europe, where CGI is galore. This sixties movie amazed me, even dubbed in French. A pure masterpiece, which has nothing to envy to Hollywood material. Excellent camera work, jawdropping cast and acting. Such movies are so rare to find, especially from Eastern Europe. If you crave for Medieval films, with plenty of extras, battles, gruesome and awesome battles, pulled by outstanding production design, this film is definitely for you. I don&apos;t know the other movies from this director, political oriented, but if I have the opportunity to watch them, I won&apos;t miss."

Marlon is so in love that he&apos;s decided to go to the college of Jessica&apos;s choice, Ramsey College. Anthony Edwards is Kip, who recruits for Ramsey and admits to Marlon that he&apos;s heard of worse reasons for wanting to go to a specific college, so Marlon and his friend Oliver (played by Christopher Rydell, son of director Mark Rydell, and if he looks familiar, it may be because you remember him making the wisecrack &apos;I didn&apos;t know they had gas back then&apos; to Henry Fonda in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;) go to Ramsey to check it out. Various other students attend, the most interesting of which is Vera, a feisty girl working at Mickey D&apos;s who has college aspirations but whose mother is wary of her daughter ending up disappointed.\n\nComedy is hit and miss. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes flat. Tons of cameos (Curtis Armstrong, Taylor Negron, Bob Eubanks (!) and Brian-Doyle Murray) are enjoyable. Coming in at a svelte 88 minutes, you&apos;ve done a lot worse. 7/10.",

He had much success as &quot;Accion Mutante&quot; , &quot; El Dia De la Bestia&quot; , &quot;Perlita Durango&quot; and ¨La Comunidad¨ , among others . De la Iglesia is back with a tragical comedy about two Spanish clowns of the 70s . Here deals with a homage to dark humor and Spanish history from the Civil War until the 7os . In the film there are comedy, tongue in cheek, humor, horror, action, drama and is pretty entertaining . It&apos;s an exaggerated drama/comedy giving the perfect tone through the entire film , you can either follow it or just wander about the ridiculousness of every single minute . Some may regard this kind of dramatic comedy dull or dumb , but the truth is its the most simple, minimalistic, rawest, and pretentious comedy you will ever watch . As the shy Javier (Carlos Areces) and the violent Sergio (Antonio De La Torre) are two clowns who reach the heights of success with their circus show , but eerie events and an acrobat woman (Carolina Bang , partner is director Alex De Iglesia) turning them into deadly enemies . However, the hate between them grows as fast, and as much, as their horrible faces . \n\nThe picture blends thrills , suspense, tension as well as an intriguing script full of dark comedy , drama and exciting situations . Packed with scenes of absurd nature, this story is a fantastic farce, as we follow the ridiculous careers of a pair of clowns whose destination is dictated by a fateful love , rather than by their own decisions . The film works on various levels and is constantly reconfigured , however contains some embarrassing , contriving moments and also certain excess . Strong performance from three protagonists , Areces , Bang , De La Torre and excellent plethora of secondaries as Manuel Tejada , Gracia Olayo , Enrique Villen , Manuel Tallafe , all of them usual actors in ¨Pluton BRB Nero¨ series produced by Alex De Iglesia . Interesting screenplay Alex De La Iglesia who usually writes his films and bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Dying of laughter¨ or ¨Muertos de Risa¨ also with two comedians -Gran Wyoming and Santiago Segura , Alex&apos;s fetish actor- who reach the heights of success with their spectacle, becoming them into huge enemies . Atmospheric and dark cinematography by Kiko De La Rica with a good camera work . Suspenseful musical score by Roque Baños . The motion picture is well directed by De La Iglesia . He&apos;s a cool director has got much success as ¨Accion Mutante¨, ¨Crimen Ferpecto¨and ¨Oxford murders¨, and winner of several Goyas (Spanish Oscars), however his movies have not yet reached box office in USA, but he has strong followers . Nonsense, ridicule , laughters , absurdity , terror , disturbing scenes .. and many other issues ; you can find everything in this movie . The movie is a lot of fun, especially for those who know the historical period . This is without a doubt a thrilling and thought-provoking movie to be enjoyed for dark humor buffs and Alex De Iglesia fans.",

      "reviewBody": "The director received funding for a 10-minute film and used those miniscule funds to make the most spirited film ever made (in my opinion), an extremely moving piece about two children in Siberia. The film is loose-as-a-goose -- there&apos;s never been a movie as &quot;un-rigid&quot; as this. In my mind it&apos;s a bookend to another film about children, the Spanish film &quot;Spirit of the Beehive.&quot; But where that film&apos;s depth is in its poetry and mystery, this film&apos;s depth is in its emotions and sheer good-fellowship. They&apos;re opposites. Except that, to me, there&apos;s never been two better films. Why hasn&apos;t Kanevsky&apos;s second film, &quot;An Independent Life,&quot; been released in the U.S.? Why has the second film of Victor Erice (the Spanish director), &quot;The South,&quot; been virtually unseen in the U.S.? (It&apos;s as good as &quot;Spirit of the Beehive.&quot;) I tell you... seeing those films will spoil you for nearly every other film!",

      "reviewBody": "The premise of this story challenges both of its romantic leads to use their bodies to convey the characters&apos; emotions.  Jong-du, played by Sol Kyung-gu, is an awkward ex-con whose older brother calls him immature but he seems a little crazy, or maybe mentally deficient.  His family reluctantly helps him out, but he is an embarrassment and a nuisance to them.\n\nGong-ju (Moon So-ri) is a woman with cerebral palsy whose family is just as bad as Jong-du&apos;s.  When Jong-du begins to visit her an odd relationship develops, with each bringing the other an acceptance and appreciation neither has felt before.\n\nMoon So-ri&apos;s performance is so convincing I actually thought she had c.p. until a fantasy sequence showed what Gong-ju imagined herself doing if she were not disabled.  But it&apos;s not just the contortions of c.p. that she portrays.  She manages to show every possible emotion within the confines of c.p. spasms and she brings the character to life with a fully developed range of emotions and intellect.\n\nSol Kyung-gu&apos;s body language is just as effective, though his performance is easily overshadowed by Moon So-ri&apos;s.  He is by turns menacing, sweet, dim-witted, shy, playful, inconsiderate and contrite, and most of this comes out through his body language.\n\nI saw this movie with English subtitles, but the acting is so effective that you almost don&apos;t need to read them.\n\np.s. keep three hankies handy"

A lot of people have of course been commenting on Mr Hartnett&apos;s attempt at a Yorkshire accent. Anyone British like me and no doubt most of everyone else will also be wondering what country he&apos;s pretending to be from when he says the majority of his lines. It seems the writers gave him lines as short as possible to avoid him buggering up completely. Even so the film is great and Josh, despite looking strained does a fairly good job. Bless &apos;im."

This is certainly more than enough to please Yes fans. And because of the large variety of songs, styles and performances, I guess that listeners who are not accustomed with Yes music yet (but with good ears) will find find more than enough to understand why Yes has reached, and is still on top of the symphonic rock bill after almost forty (!) years. The symphonic orchestra adds some really nice touches, enhance yet never take over the music, just as it should be. The only drawback for me is a lack of &apos;bite&apos; in some of the more raw numbers. I still prefer the studio version of &apos;Gates&apos;, for instance. Anderson presents most of the songs in an endurable &apos;in jest&apos; way. This makes it harder for me to take him, and even the music, seriously. Yes music is not &apos;in jest&apos;. It is MUSIC, pure and simple, in all its excitement, magnificence, joy, aggression, and virtuosity. Enjoy!",

Jerry Blake (O&apos;Quinn) is the new realtor in town, a perfect neighbor and family man; but something is awry- Dr. Bondurant is killed and strange occurrences crop up.\n\nIf you have never seen this film, it is a worthwhile suspense/thriller; there are also some beautiful scenes of the Pacific Northwest- you will enjoy this film for Halloween.",

      "reviewBody": "Those commentators who thought this movie was rubbish were either totally uneducated or in a vile mood and shouldn&apos;t have bothered watching, or else they have no knowledge of life at all.\n\nThe story was deep, and that requires thought and insight for an audience to appreciate, not just superficial watching and waiting for the action. There were so many messages in this one film I would need to write a thesis to cover them all. Sure, there were a few weaknesses, but a film is made to entertain an audience, not to satisfy literary critics. I found the characters all extremely clear-cut, the situations well portrayed, the story satisfying and very poignant. Again, the portrayal of the twins and their sad story was a very deep concept, open to all sorts of interpretation. The final scene was absolutely spot-on - a view into endlessness, waiting for explanation of why things happen as they do.\n\nMatthew Modine is an outstanding actor, who is in my opinion not sufficiently appreciated for his fine work. Maybe for the average cinema-goer he plays parts that require more insight, and therefore doesn&apos;t hit the spotlights. That he doesn&apos;t appear in every boulevard magazine is a tribute to his qualities, they don&apos;t lend themselves to cheap gossip. His double role in this film is proof of his versatility, even though neither role is at all flattering to an actor&apos;s image. Who wants to play a loser! or a small-time gangster? Respectively, who can do it convincingly? I watch this film every time it&apos;s shown and can still find more in it. A real &quot;cult&quot; film, Mr. Modine&apos;s specialty.",

      "reviewBody": "Through a chance meeting in the street, our hero Billy Bathgate (Loren Dean) encounters and impresses the notorious 1930&apos;s gangster and bootlegger Dutch Schultz and even becomes his protégé.\n\nGangster films, like westerns, have so many cinematic plus points built in that making a totally duff one is pretty hard. This is a very professional piece of work, but hardly takes the genre to another level. One of the games you can play while watching is ticking of the clichés one-by-one.\n\n(For the record the lead&apos;s poor mother - she works in a laundry - doesn&apos;t reject his &quot;dirty&quot; money, which I thought was compulsory in this type of movie, but most other must-haves are observed: The &quot;surprise&quot; summary execution and the chase through the period streets - to name but two - are both here!)\n\nDustin Hoffman is surpassingly good as a gangster who treats other people as collectable/disposable items. While he has a cold streak, you feel that only people that cross him are going to get the chop (one of whom is Bruce Willis - who looks like he took a small part to wear the clothes).\n\nMore ambiguous is his love (or is she?) interest Nicole Kidman who he seems to enjoy mentally torturing. I couldn&apos;t get a clear grip on her mentality or why she goes along with it all - not even for her own security reasons.\n\nDean is a good looking young actor who looks about ripe for corruption, but the role doesn&apos;t require him to be cool or knowledgeable merely look on as a witness, so that we can too. His attraction for Kidman, who seems to like casually undressing in public, is natural given that he is supposed to be a wide-eyed virgin.\n\nNaturally hanging around with gangsters isn&apos;t a safe sport and soon Billy is in hot water that he has to think himself out of, but I think you can safely guess that what the final outcome will be.\n\nBilly Bathgate is the work of solid pros from the script to the scenery (very believable 1930&apos;s NY), but the piece never reaches the heights and for long periods jogs along like a marathon runner conserving energy.\n\nWhile delivering no fireworks or giving you anything new it gets you through to the end without being bored. Nevertheless it is hardly the type of film you would want to own or even sit through twice.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a well made and relevant film that explores the moral, ethical and legal implications of war against an insurgency. Rossi, a young French soldier who is a lawyer in training enlists into the Army and goes to Algeria where the French were trying to pacify Algeria 40 years ago. Rossi&apos;s experiences with his Colonel and the methods used by the Colonel against the insurgency puts Rossi in an impossible situation. The story alternates between the war and present day where a murder investigation is under way and a mysterious diary of Rossi is being mailed anonymously in pieces by someone and read by a sympathetic and riveted female soldier who is investigating the murder that seems to be related to Rossi&apos;s diary and the events described within.",

The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.",

Remakes of popular movies from the 30&apos;s and early 40&apos;s seem to be trendy nowadays in the Hungarian film industry (see also Hippolyt from 1999). Obviously, the producers wanted to build on the success of the original story and they could easily do so due to the similarities between 30&apos;s and 00&apos;s in terms of social trends. Meseautó will be probably a solid financial success (a surprising new trend for Hungarian movies) in the trendy cinema multiplexes because after the decade of overwhelming dominance of Hollywood it is now trendy again to go for local productions (at least the showroom was packed when I saw the movie). Otherwise the movie is rather mediocre, except for a  few enjoyable gags.",

In the beginning the only thing that he wanted is to be useful for his family. To help his ex-wife and to love his lovely daughter. And certainly the only thing that he lives with was cycling. In Marks childhood his father made a big mistake in drowning grief in wine, his only son was left alone in the world of misunderstanding and pain. Even good talents were deeply hidden under the mask of feelings and anger. The anger on his father. Marks is overcoming his tragedy with great help of his best friend and with love of a beautiful woman who see a light in him and made everything to release it. Great story, great playing. Sometimes dialogs are too continuous but it gives a fine atmosphere for the movie. If you are fond of cycling or living through the chain of losses in your life - Phantom pain is your choice.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was sabotaged by its own PR team.\n\nPutting &quot;gore&quot; in the title is supposed to be like a red handkerchief in the back pocket of your jeans, letting you know what you&apos;re getting into. I think the very title is what gave people a misleading expectation that wasn&apos;t fulfilled. And thus, a tainted view of the actual movie -- which was almost good, with some rare and surpisingly horrific moments.\n\nAnd THAT was the biggest &quot;jump scare&quot; of them all: finding out that Tokyo Gore School was on a much higher tier than other movies of its ilk. Of course, that means that there were more BORING parts e.g., people talking to each other, kissing, introspection, etc. But the boring movie part of a supposedly GORE movie rendered the movie an almost good movie.\n\nThe lead was cute enough to keep looking at.\n\nSeems like he actually knew his way through a mid-air swirl and twist.\n\nThe movie kept my interest WITHOUT the hoped for gore.\n\nBut still, I was satisfied.\n\nBUT -- there WAS some gore. Don&apos;t get it twisted.\n\nJust not all that much. Acting happened instead.\n\nBut we were tainted with a misleading brain meme that caused us to twist our balloon animal of attention a certain way, and then those expections and hopes were destroyed.\n\nBut on the bright side, there&apos;s usually a friend that isn&apos;t so much into gore, horror, and violence. So you compromise:\n\nTokyo Gore School is a perfect movie for you two to enjoy together."

      "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with a young woman by the name of &quot;Yukiyo Sugiuchi&quot; (Eriko Hatsune) having just moved into a new apartment and unpacking her household items. It&apos;s during this time that she happens to smell an awful odor and upon checking it out is thrown from the 13th floor onto the ground below. The scene then shifts to a few months later with a small group of people gathering in that same apartment building to celebrate the fact that their good friend &quot;Sayaki Midorikawa&quot; (Aki Fukada) is moving into a new apartment building. Naturally, being a young woman who has never lived on her own before, Sayaki is thrilled to have found such an inexpensive place to rent. However, it&apos;s during this time that she also smells a strong odor coming from one of the rooms within the apartment. So, being somewhat concerned about where the odor is coming from, she promptly goes to check it out. Minutes later she returns to her friends and--to their great shock and dismay--she then proceeds to throw herself off of the balcony to her death. A few days later, Sayaki&apos;s older sister &quot;Mariko Midorikawa&quot; (Noriko Nakagoshi) goes to pick up her belongings and begins to see hallucinations of her sister in that same apartment. Little does she realize that, the longer she continues to investigate Sayaki&apos;s death, the closer she gets to the real horror behind it. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this could have been a pretty good horror film but it lacked the suspense necessary for a movie of this sort. Admittedly, Noriko Nakagoshi, was quite attractive and performed her role rather well. But even so, it wasn&apos;t enough to overcome the rather uninspired plot and I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average.",

Years later I can appreciate the stellar performances by the 2 legendary Italian actresses Anna Magnani and Julieta Masina. The story begins with Masina&apos;s arrival in jail, innocently convicted. The young, shattered woman is immediately befriended by the experienced criminal Magnanni. Several intriguing characters are introduced and side-plots spun out. Masina eventually is exhaunorated, but returns &quot;for a visit&quot;, with shocking results.\n\nThis film, like other Italian Post-War masterpieces (&quot;La Strada&quot;, &quot;The Biscycle Thief&quot;) focuses on the lingering poverty, a direct result of a &quot;lost war&quot;, and the deep gaps between the haves and the have nots. The &quot;little guy&quot; in that place and time had very few laughs, as the better-off will exploit the desperate. A fascinating score and beautiful black &amp; white cinematography make this one of the supreme foreign film classics. I highly recommend this film.*****",

      "reviewBody": "I have previously reviewed a couple films by Minoru Kawasaki and found both of them to be completely bizarre...as well as worthy additions to my &quot;you ain&apos;t seen nothing&apos; yet&quot; series of reviews of strange films. Executive Koala is a strange murder mystery starring a guy dressed up in a koala costume and Rug Cop is a hilarious film where a weirdo group of hero cops, and a smart toupee, fight evil! Here in Calamari Wrestler, Kawasaki has crafted yet another ultra-strange film...a film about a professional wrestler somehow reincarnated as a giant squid!!\n\nWhen the film begins, Taguchi has just been crowned the king of Japanese wrestling. However, as he raised his new championship belt to the heavens, it&apos;s snatched away....by a six foot tall squid!! And then the squid proceeds to beat the crap out of the champ. No, this is not a cartoon...the filmmaker has a guy in tights wearing a squid costume! Sounds pretty weird...well, it only gets weirder from here!\n\nAt first, Calamari Wrestler has a hard time getting a re-match with Taguchi. After all, the big shots in charge of wrestling don&apos;t want the invertebrate to be a hero and will only arrange a match if Calamari agrees to throw the fight! Undaunted, he goes on a campaign to win the love of the Japanese public and soon the fans are demanding the fight takes place...and Calamari be allowed to try his best to win. However, when the big match is just about to begin, a huge surprise takes place....Taguchi has learned how to transform himself into a giant fighting octopus!!! Who will win this battle of the titans? And, what other incredibly strange surprises are in store for the audience when they see this film? And trust me...it only gets stranger!!\n\nThis film is very enjoyable because it never takes itself seriously and is great for a laugh. It certainly ain&apos;t sophisticated entertainment, but it IS entertaining and fun. Quality-wise, I still prefer Rug Cop, but Calamari Wrestler is still one delightfully strange film and a worthy addition to Kawasaki&apos;s list of bizarro films!",

Patsy Kelly is especially good as the wise-cracking maid and just about everyone belives Bela Lugosi (the butler) is behind the crimes. But is he? See the movie and find out. The Ritz Brothers are mildly amusing and a trio of inept detectives. Had the Marx Brothers or The Three Stooges been cast instead, this would be a great film. However, all in all, &quot;The Gorilla&quot; is worth watching just the way it is."

      "reviewBody": "BANDITS FROM SHANTUNG (1972) has some great atmosphere and a couple of superb fight scenes, but it doesn&apos;t have enough of a plot to keep us fully engaged. It starts off well enough with some nice build-up in a sprawling deserted farm town (a nice backlot on a Taiwan location) as various motley characters show up at the town&apos;s only open establishment, a tavern/inn, with some evil doings in mind. When advance men for the title bandits show up to lay the groundwork for a raid, they round up all available hostages but one. That one is the film&apos;s lone hero (Chang Yi), whose motivation is simply stated—he&apos;s there to check up on family—but no one believes him. At the thirty-minute mark, he launches into an eight-minute battle with the two bandit chieftains, hand-to-hand with one (Sammo Hung) and swordplay with the other (an actor I didn&apos;t recognize). It&apos;s a well-staged brawl and it spreads all over the empty town.\n\nAfterwards, not much of interest happens until the next major fight scene, which takes up the film&apos;s last 13 minutes as our hero fights the bandit leader (Pai Ying). It&apos;s a good fight, but we haven&apos;t really seen enough of the villain up to this point to feel any stake in it. And he&apos;s done such a poor job of banditry throughout the film that he seems a bit out of his league with this formidable hero. So there&apos;s not much suspense.\n\nThe few notable supporting cast members include Hu Chin (one of the kung fu-fighting tavern maids in THE FATE OF LEE KHAN), Chien Yuet San (who played a Japanese villain in WHEN TAEKWONDO STRIKES) and future kung fu great Sammo Hung, but they have relatively small parts. All the great characters we meet in the first half-hour are pretty much gone from the movie by the 40-minute mark, after the first major fight. Sammo Hung choreographed the fight scenes. The film&apos;s writer-director is Huang Feng, who was responsible for so many of Golden Harvest&apos;s early kung fu classics (LADY WHIRLWIND, HAPKIDO, WHEN TAEKWONDO STRIKES, etc.).\n\nStill, it&apos;s short (79 min.) and well-paced and shot amidst picturesque locations and that awesome set built in the middle of the Taiwan countryside. And it&apos;s nice to see Chang Yi still playing heroes after being a leading man at Shaw Bros. (THE SECRET OF THE DIRK) but before his great streak of kung fu villainy in the later &apos;70s (TRAITOROUS, EAGLE&apos;S CLAW, CHALLENGE OF DEATH, FATAL NEEDLES VS. FATAL FISTS, etc.)."

Vincent seriously tells his stories, not relying on obnoxious comedy or jump scares to sell the movies. There is an almost operatic edge to the manner in which the tantrik (played by Mohanlal) reaches heights of greatness, but his succumbing to his baser instincts leads to his downfall.\n\nVincent also made the intriguing Vayanadan Thampan (1978), in which a young Kamalahaasan plays a vampiric warlock who manages to live across centuries by seducing maidens and drinking their blood.",

I later had the opportunity to watch some reruns of the old black-and-white sitcom with its brilliant performances.\n\nI had high hopes for this movie, and I wasn&apos;t really disappointed. I just enjoyed it for what it was. A silly two hours with commercials with some reasonably talented actors making me laugh with ridiculous situations. But I couldn&apos;t help but think that someone out there could have done it better. After all, Jackie Gleason, Art Carney and Audrey Meadows were some of the greatest comic actors ever. No one in this movie even came close.\n\nJohn Leguizamo gives a real standout performance here. If anyone is talented out of this cast, he is. But Cedric the Entertainer, Mike Epps and Gabrielle Union all give good performances too. It&apos;s just that this movie was probably on the same level as Tyler Perry or Martin Lawrence. Fun, but nothing that could be called &quot;The Greatest&quot;.\n\nThe women working? No way Jackie Gleason would let his wife work, remember? Audrey Meadows, however, would have put him in his place if she had ever needed to work. And as I recall, she was too pretty for the role. Gabrielle Union is gorgeous.\n\nThe storyline with the dog is kind of ridiculous and miraculous. But it made me laugh.\n\nThe movie&apos;s villain is too cartoonish. But I always hoped he wouldn&apos;t get that great house and that our heroes would.\n\nDon&apos;t expect too much, but it&apos;s not so bad."

      "reviewBody": "The presence of Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin in &quot;Midnight Run&quot; seemed to cause many people to wildly overrate that standard action movie; similarly, the we-hate-Forrest-Gump crowd approached the quietly compelling &quot;Cast Away&quot; with too much prejudice to view it fairly. In &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (the English-language title of &quot;Le Pacte des loups&quot;), a character says that lies told in Latin can be seen as truth; the fact that this is a commercial film in French (with subtitles so you can fool yourself into feeling clever that you&apos;re watching an art movie) may explain why some are very, very enthusiastic about it. Not that the movie doesn&apos;t deserve praise (it does in a lot of ways); it&apos;s just that I wonder if they&apos;d have been as impressed had it been the identical film shot in English and with an American cast (or with Americans other than Mark Dacascos).\n\nBased on the French tale of a deadly creature that roamed the Gallic countryside in the 18th century and was never caught, &quot;Le Pacte des loups&quot; plays like a better, more coherent, more frightening version of &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; with the representative from the major city (Samuel le Bihan)and his Iroquois Indian blood brother (Dacascos) sent to investigate the gruesome goings-on, and gradually finding out there&apos;s far more than meets the eye - although unlike &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; which went overboard with the decapitations, the murders are kept to a minimum in the early going (we do see the beast attacking two of its female victims (the beast only attacks women and children) in the first half, but most of the details are kept to our imaginations... unlike later on in the movie). The movie takes its time setting the pace and mood, slipping in a few clues to the resolution - one hint: watch out for the gun - and risking losing the audience because it really is pretty methodical; but once all the main characters have been introduced, and once past the halfway point, the movie really starts to deliver.\n\nDirector/co-writer Christophe Gans leaves several narrative threads hanging, but barring a few plot holes this doesn&apos;t damage the movie&apos;s overall effect because so much stuff is woven into it; the tunnel vision of several of the characters, religious symbolism, conspiracy, a hint of incest between a crippled aristocratic hunter (Vincent Cassel) and his sister (Emilie Dequenne) that comes up in a crucial moment of the plot... provided you don&apos;t think it over too much afterwards (for starters, why does the beast not go after men?), or simply think on the movie&apos;s impressive visuals (the first fight scene and several thereafter are in slow motion, but when le Bihan launches an attack on the baddies towards the end - for reasons I won&apos;t divulge here - they come in regular speed; some of the CGI effects are a bit awkward, but the work of Jim Henson&apos;s Creature Shop is thankfully less like the Bloop in &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and more like their usual effective stuff, with a creature guaranteed to give you nightmares), it works just fine.\n\nMention should also be made of the fine score from Joseph LoDuca, no stranger to scoring uncharacteristically zesty historical stories after Hercules and Xena - his cue for our heroes going hunting and the final scene are standouts, although I could have lived without that song over the credits (sung in English, by the way); of the cast&apos;s acting, with special nods to Cassel, Dacascos, and Monica Bellucci as the prostitute who turns out to be more involved with the plot than it appears (if only American actors (and while we&apos;re at it, British ones) were as multilingual as their Continental counterparts); and of the brutal but effective fight scenes, with a particularly impressive climax. While this isn&apos;t the all-timer some say it is (that first hour IS a problem), I enjoyed it in the end; despite its reputation, French cinema has always had its accessible offerings (let&apos;s not forget it gave us &quot;Diva,&quot; Brigitte Bardot, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; and Luc Besson, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; notwithstanding), and this is further proof.\n\nAs for Monica Bellucci naked - definitely one of the most memorable (and unlike the other ones, decidedly pleasant) moments in the movie, with Gans throwing in an amazing dissolve from Miss Bellucci&apos;s topography to that of the French mountains. For once, Jim Henson&apos;s Creature Shop doesn&apos;t contribute the most impressive bodywork to a film."

It was, and still is, the most memorable musical experience for me. The singing and dancing were of course top notch.\n\nFor a film version I would have much preferred a good film of the actual stage production, as has been done with the great &quot;Cats.&quot; However, they made the movie, and it does not stink as some seem to want to make everyone believe. When Morales does &quot;Nothing&quot;, or when the three girls do &quot;At The Ballet&quot;, this film version has the same impact as the stage version does, even if the singing is often mediocre when compared to the Broadway cast. So, anyone who is a fan of musicals, and who thought the stage version was a &quot;10&quot;, then the film is probably a &quot;7&quot;, or maybe a &quot;6&quot; at the lowest. Those who rate this film version of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; very low simply are showing themselves as very poor critics.\n\nEdit: May 2019 - I watched it again on DVD, very nice to see it again. And now in 2021 it is available online via streaming services. I found it on Amazon streaming.\n\nEdit: MAR 2024 - Again, this time streaming on Prime, I came away with an even better opinion of this version."

Humor is not absent and the scene of the petition is a great moment of fun.The &quot;speeches&quot; in the gardens of the bride&apos;s father&apos;s desirable mansion introduce a bizarre emotion .And the little lighthouse and Pierre&apos;s story predate another Lioret &apos;s movie &quot;L&apos;Equipier&quot; ,in which the heroes are lighthouse keepers.\n\nWhy this title? The word is used once in the whole movie ,but for the heroine,it means her salad days ,when everything was still possible."

The tale of power and of right-wing/fascist politics corrupting is shockingly timely even today, in this time of global conflict, with enemies branded &quot;unpatriotic.&quot;\n\nThe movie portrays the moral corruption of Italian police and politics in the 1970&apos;s, with totalitarian tactics wrapped in patriotism.  The movie&apos;s lead policeman is swept up in the power of position.  Sadly, it&apos;s only too easy for me to believe his ability to use his position and power to manipulate people and place himself above &quot;the law&quot;.\n\nThe movie &quot;looks&quot; Italian and 1970&apos;s, with stark concrete and flat colors, which appealed to me.  The story builds well, jumping backwards to fill in details, to climax in an alternate possible ending, very believable.  I highly recommend it."

Actually it would have been a pretty good if it was a Bosnian movie, but it does not live up to the expectations of a Hollywood movie of a major movie star. \n\nThe story was weak - the main characters meet once, then they meet again when she is kidnapped by Serbian soldiers and they are suddenly in love. It feels like they were in a relationship before the war but the movie never makes that clear. \n\nThere is no background on the war, no explanation why any of these events are taking place, no reason where the all that hate is coming from.\n\nThe characters stroke me as emotionless. I understand that some of that could be attributed to being used to seeing death and atrocities during the war, but there is little war footage and it feels fake.\n\nThere is some character development, the Serbian commander has some second thoughts about the reasons behind the war, but overall he simply goes along with everything with little to no emotion and giving very little insight in his thoughts reasoning.\n\nThe cinematography was good, the acting was pretty good, the story is original and engaging even though it&apos;s not developed well. \n\n&quot;No Man&apos;s Land&quot; is much better movie on the Bosnian war in my opinion.",

      "reviewBody": "I liked it a whole lot, while at the same time this film has absolutely nothing to do with Sátántangó Béla. This I knew before I watched it, which is why I didn&apos;t really expect to like it. The only thing it has in common with his more recent films (starting with &apos;Damnation&apos;) is that it doesn&apos;t have much that you could call a plot, but it IS very straight-forward.\n\n&quot;Plot&quot;: It&apos;s no more than a very simple portrayal of a couple with two kids. The man is working as a &quot;button-pusher&quot; while the woman watches the kids at home.\n\nShe cries and yells a lot. He tries to evade her as good as possible to spend his time watching TV, reading the paper, playing pool, drinking beer with his workmates,...\n\nShe wants: -To be with him more often. -Some quality time with the family. -And also some quality time for herself, walking around in pretty dresses, doing girl&apos;s stuff. She doesn&apos;t actually know what she wants because she lacks interest in any hobbies, nor does she have any friends apart from her family.\n\nHe wants: -Freedom to do whatever he wants to do at any given moment.- Enough money to buy all the stuff one has to have to have made it in life (e.g.: a car, a house,...). He doesn&apos;t actually know what he wants, because he is stuck with one woman, he isn&apos;t a rock star, he isn&apos;t the world&apos;s most popular man, he isn&apos;t filthy rich,...\n\nAbout the style of &apos;The Prefab People&apos;: The film certainly isn&apos;t noteworthy for its visual appeal. The whole movie is shot hand-held. There is a preference for long shots but neither are they meticulously planned nor does Béla Tarr limit himself to only using long shots. Dialogue scenes are rather conventionally edited, with cutting back and forth. The camera points at the preferred action and that&apos;s basically it. Rarely it shows characters &quot;doing nothing&quot;. It&apos;s dialogue-heavy and the dialogue is very basic, or &quot;real&quot;, if you want to call it that. No poetic stuff or monologues.\n\nIt&apos;s like a Michael Haneke film for Hungarians. But not as judgmental of its characters and the result of unfulfilling, monotonous, invisible imprisonment in socialism are frustrated human beings, rather than anti-social and eventually violent ones, as in Haneke&apos;s films. I&apos;ve read that it&apos;s like a Cassavetes film, but I wouldn&apos;t know anything about that. Other than of Haneke I was also reminded of early Fassbinder. If it played in Germany and the cast was speaking German, it would have worked just as well. The film&apos;s title could have been: &quot;Why Does Herr F. Go Away?&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "1942&apos;s Iceland is a wartime film about a playboy marine, James Murfin (John Payne) stationed in Iceland. There he meets Katina (Henie), a lovely young woman in a hurry to get married so that her sister can marry a man who will bring some much-needed cash into the family. As in many cultures, the older girl must marry first. Katina, however, isn&apos;t crazy about the man who has proposed something like 36 times (Sterling Holloway), so when she meets Murfin, she says they met a few years earlier and are in love. Before Murfin knows it, he&apos;s engaged, the marriage license has been registered, and at one point, the family believes that he&apos;s Katina&apos;s husband.\n\nThere&apos;s not much of a story here, but some of the music is pleasant enough and well sung by Joan Merrill. Sonja has some great skating sequences. Figure skating was different in those days - much more dance oriented with no big jumps - barrel rolls and singles were about it. Sonja was a dazzling performer who had great speed and a thrilling signature spin that started slowly and went faster and faster, until she resembled a whirling dervish. Her contribution to the world of figure skating is invaluable: She popularized figure skating, invented the skating show, and made white skating boots the thing to wear! John Payne is handsome and does a good job as Murfin, but he doesn&apos;t get to really sing. He had such a nice voice, it&apos;s a shame. Felix Bressart plays Katina&apos;s father and is a joy as always. Jack Oakie is Murfin&apos;s comic buddy, and he&apos;s good as well.\n\nHowever, when you&apos;re watching a Sonja Henie movie, it&apos;s Sonja&apos;s skating that&apos;s the true star. This isn&apos;t her best film, but it&apos;s still entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "Very silly if not outright preposterous film in which director/writer/actor Armin Müller Stahl shows us a 103 year old  Adolf Hitler. The aim of the film is to demystify the man Adolf Hitler, but it is a good thing that Müller-Stahl explained this when it premiered as from the film itself it is never clear what Müller-Stahl tries to achieve. It is neither satirical nor thought-provoking (the film at any moment did not provoke any thought with me as I was trying to stay awake). \n\nWhat is the viewer expected to do with a Hitler who shoots peas at his visitor, refuses to take his medicine and is simply annoying to the 2 people around him. Is this supposed to be funny? The conversations do not lead anywhere and certainly no laughs, also due to the fact that there is no chemistry between  Muller Stahl and Robert Balaban. The film basically only concerns itself with the story idea of the 6 actors who doubled as Adolf Hitler during his life. So what? Did Müller-Stahl wanted to say that the acting of the real Hitler made the German people believe in him?\n\nThere is one moment that is is very hilarious: one of the doubles doing the Hamlet &quot;To be or not to be&quot; routine in Hitlerian fashion. This is a surreal moment and maybe the whole idea should have been executed in this fashion. On the other hand: where did I see this before? John Cleese as Hitler on the balcony of a house in an English suburb; Ernst Lubitsch and Jack Benny?\n\nIt seems to me that Müller-Stahl had a &quot;hunch at a possible idea&quot;, but forgot to make it into a solid subject for a film that would have some meaning. In stead of demystifying Hitler he made a mystifying film that never is a contribution to the Hitler debate. The very good cinematography and superb set design - Hitler&apos;s Berlin bunker was duplicated in the studio - can not save this one. (2/10)",

      "reviewBody": "Though Gene Kelly is superb as the athletic strolling player Serafin, and is given some of the best dancing opportunities of his career, this is Miss Garland&apos;s film all the way. And what a film! How strange that it isn&apos;t better known.\n\nIn one of their rare moments of scenic largesse, Metro released Garland from the small town confinements of Hardy--ville, and/or the sweet girl who makes it to Broadway with the corn stalks still in her suitcase, and gave her something of genuine wit and sophistication.\n\nFor here, she is Manuela Alvarez, of the colonial Virgin Islands, a well born, cloistered 19th century maiden, (presumably convent educated, i.e., Gladys Cooper to Judy, &quot;...we&apos;ll take refuge in the church!&quot;) whose only psychic escape from her self enclosure consists in fantasizing about the notorious pirate, &quot;Mack the Black Macoco.&quot; That she is tricked into believing a dashing actor, Serafin (Kelly) is the real Macoco, while in fact he is none other than her lumpy affianced, Mayor Dom Pedro (Walter Slezak) is the spindle upon which this cinematic yarn spins its glories.\n\nAnd what phantasmagoric glories they are! This ranks with &quot;Yolanda and the Thief,&quot; (sorry &quot;American in Paris&quot; fans) as Mr. Minnelli&apos;s most accomplished Technicolor visual achievement. For working with Jack Martin Smith, he concocts a Caribbean sea port a swirl with color and characters--one can almost smell the salt air a waft with spice and languor, and including as well: a quay brimming with turbanned negroe vendors, a village of Salmon and off white stucco walls, and black filagreed wrought iron against a cerulean sky, and bevys of extras dressed in a fortune worth of rainbow colored moire, velvet and brocade flounces, furbellows, snoods, and gauntlets. The shaded interiors are replete with empire furniture, carved ebony, and bamboo blinds and palmettos.\n\nThe effect is dreamlike in an operetta sort of way and deliberately so. A storybook come to life but one which successfully combines the conventions of 19th century aristocratic propriety, (in which young women of quality do not walk out without their duennas) against 20th century show biz colloquialisms to great effect, (one thinks here of Mr. Kelly&apos;s delightful reference to a review in the &quot;Trinidad Clarion comparing him to David Garrick&quot;,&quot;No Noose is Good Noose,&quot; and &quot;You should try underplaying sometime.&quot; \n\nThe players are at the top of their form: Mr. Kelly is in full command of his powers here: his partnering with the Nicholas Brothers in &quot;Be a Clown,&quot; as well as the &quot;Pirate Ballet&quot; (in which he pivots with a javelin against a cinnabar sky lit with explosions) almost literally take ones breath away.\n\nBut it is in &quot;Ninia&quot; that he achieves the most felicitous display of solo Terpsichore, with Robert Alton&apos;s choreography, Harry Stradling&apos;s fluid boom camera following his cat like moves over up and through the town, and the delightful Cole Porter lyric and melody, culminating in flamenco steps with torrid and tempting MGM contract dancers in and through the striped poles of a circular gazebo.\n\nOf Miss Garland enough cannot be said. No more Betsy Booth! Manuela offers her a chance to broaden her range in a direction in which (sadly) she would never venture again.\n\nHere her exasperated intonations wring humor out of every line and situation, &quot;Oh Casilda I do wish you were a little more spiritual!&quot; or &quot;Do you call it fun to live in a tent? to go hungry ?, to be looked down on by all decent people?!&quot; give full vent to the drollery the script affords. Indeed, she channels her trademarked nervous energy into her character in such a way, that she, (as &quot;Parent&apos;s Magazine&quot; noted in its review) gently spoofs some of her earlier film characterizations. Thus we get the Dorothy like: (&quot;I know it, something dreadful is going to happen, something dreadful...&quot;) It&apos;s a performance that one cannot simply imagine any other actress playing. Thus, she claims the role and makes it her own.\n\nAnd who can forget the scene where she pretends to believe Serafin is Macoco once she has discovered the deception, &quot;I can see us now, you with your cutlass in one hand and your compass in the other, shouting orders to your pirate crew, and I, I spurring you on to greater and greater achievements, won&apos;t that be magnificent?!&quot; to which she pounds her fist against the table with sugar dipped venom.\n\nMusically she is also a delight from start to finish.\n\nMoreover, she has never been seen to such pictorial advantage in the post war period as she is here, gowned by Tom Keogh and Madame Karinska in one of the most arresting (and beaded!) wardrobes she ever wore on screen, and just as importantly, effectively coiffed throughout, (most particularly in the &quot;Love of My Life&quot; sequence where she is adorned with a coral diadem and matching earrings.) \n\nSimilarly, her close-ups are meltingly lovely, such as the nightgown clad scene wherein she begs Gladys Cooper to take her to Port Sebastian, &quot;I&apos;ll make him a good wife Aunt Inez--really.&quot; (what a vision in feminine charm she is here!) or slightly later when, clad in a broad brimmed straw hat she gazes upon the Caribbean, or perhaps best of all, with a conch shell at her ear, and under hypnosis, she whispers of Macoco to dazzled interlocutors.\n\nSupporting players are top of the mark, and it is interesting to see Garland interact with Gladys Cooper and horror veteran George Zucco.\n\nAfter it was completed, MGM relegated Garland back to formula vaudeville hokum, but thankfully &quot;The Pirate&quot; was already in the can. Musical film scholar Douglas McVay has declared it to be the best musical film of 1948. He&apos;s right. See it to find out why.",

      "reviewBody": "Very dull.\n\nTo anyone that has taken time to read it or any small part of it, Kafka&apos;s body of work does not readily lend itself to film adaptation. His fiction is savagely personal, and so the vast majority plays out in the minds of the central characters rather than through action or dialogue. And when there is dialogue, it is subtly understated, absurdly simplistic, powerful and surreal. His novels were his nightmares, and in writing they became our nightmares, imagining his quiet and steady suffocation and contemplating our own. Committing true horror to film is difficult by any standards, and this film fails outright.\n\nIt lacks the brutal eeriness that Kafka relates. It lacks the finesse of Kafka&apos;s words. It lacks the expressive thought that is instrumental in deciphering his protagonist. It lacks all but Kafka&apos;s story (and his name), and this story is really too simple. The nuances of the language never emerge and any lingering boldness is soon lost in boredom. To translate Kafka into English requires passion and true understanding; to translate Kafka to another medium requires nothing less than inspiration, and this director and his cast lack it entirely.\n\nIf you want a well-realized, true-to-Kafka film, find American animator Caroline Leaf&apos;s &quot;The Metamorphosis of Mr. Samsa&quot; or Orson Welles&apos; adaptation of this same novel, or even Rudolph Noelte&apos;s 1971 version of &quot;The Castle.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Paul Wegener, in his first talkie film, plays an evil inventor who is pursued by investigative journalist (Harald Paulsen) through four famous horror tales. The first is based on Edgar Allen Poe&apos;s &apos;The Black Cat&apos;. Wegener kills his wife and hides her behind a wall in his basement. The reporter, who hears the wife&apos;s screams as he is passing by, calls in the police days later after she is reported missing. The journalist and the police eventually find her body thanks to her meowing cat, which was also accidentally walled with the body.\n\nThe inventor escapes, only to hide in a wax museum (spoofing Paul Leni&apos;s &apos;Waxworks&apos;), where a sinister game of cat and mouse develops. The chase soon moves to an asylum (taken from another Poe story, &apos;The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether&apos;) and later, to a strange gentlemen&apos;s club which runs a sinister suicide game (from Robert Lewis Stevenson&apos;s &apos;The Suicide Club&apos;).\n\nThis is a remake of the director&apos;s own &apos;Eerie Tales&apos; (1919), which also included adaptations of &apos;The Black Cat&apos; and &apos;The Suicide Club&apos;. All three stories here have been filmed since as well - &apos;Tales of Terror&apos; (1962), &apos;Curse of the Stone Hand&apos; (1964) and &apos;Dr. Tarr&apos;s Torture Dungeon&apos; (1973) stand out as examples – so this may all feel quite familiar. Despite this, it&apos;s still very entertaining.\n\nThe novel approach of linking the separate well-known short stories into one adds a new dimension to the horror anthology sub-genre. It&apos;s intended as a spoof of Germany Expressionism, but while it may not exactly have your sides splitting, it still works as a creepy, atmospheric melodrama.\n\nIt&apos;s always fun to see Wegener, whose three silent portrayals of the Golem have ensure his place in horror history. He&apos;s great here as the villain; his stony face and narrow eyes make him appear every bit the devious killer. The rest of the less well-known cast do well too.\n\nAustrian Director Oswald, who is accredited with directing the first vampire film in 1916 (&apos;A Night of Horror&apos; - now lost), does a fine job of creating a different atmosphere for each story. Of particular note is the &apos;Dr. Tarr&apos; segment, in which a whole host of lunatics attempt to put our hero on trial.\n\nThis is a very difficult film to find which is a real shame. Highly recommended for fans of early horror.",

      "reviewBody": "A really good book cannot be entirely simulated adequately on screen. There is too much going on underneath, too many subplots, too much conversation and description to undertake in two hours. Choices made by production folk determine which direction the film will go, generally accenting one plot line of or other and allowing the rest to fall to the wayside. HOD does a fine job with the route it takes, darkly stating the consequences of empty lives which rely on artifice for sustenance. These creatures were not creating their lives so much as feeding their idea of existence without exploration. The result is tragedy but the tragedy was already in existence. The actions of the trapped subjects simply began to reflect their emptiness. This doesn&apos;t make for a happy movie but it is instructive if one chooses to see the lessons. And as art, the acting, direction and cinematography are quite fine.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Private Lessons&quot; isn&apos;t astonishingly bad... if you can look at it from the standpoint of it being a cheap adolescent thrill on late-night &quot;Skin-emax&quot; or any other premium station du jour. I&apos;m mostly fine with plots involving taboo; even the &quot;Onegai&quot; series of anime doesn&apos;t phase me. But I will say this: the one and only reason anyone should feel compelled to watch this movie is to see the rather hot (back then anyway) Sylvia Kristel in the nude. It does have a cute premise, but it&apos;s never done much justice due to all of the amateurish writing and pacing.\n\nEric Brown is Phillip Fillmore (Philly Philly??), a 15-year-old kid with hormones gone berserk. In other words, he&apos;s pretty damn average. His deadbeat dad has left on a... business trip (wink wink nudge nudge) and has left Philly back home with his recently arrived immigrant housekeeper Nicole Mallow (Kristel) and sleazy chauffeur Lester (Howard Hesseman). Seems Philly&apos;s got the hots for Nicole, and Lester takes advantage of this, persuading Nicole to fake her own death at the hands (or loins) of the boy so he can make off with Philly&apos;s money like a bandit. But Nicole switches around mid-plot, deciding instead to help stop Lester&apos;s Half-Baked Evil Scheme. Cue several slapstick hijinks culminating in a final sex scene and serve.\n\nObviously, you don&apos;t watch movies like this for plots, no matter how inane and far-fetched they may be; you watch them to get sprung. Alas, this was back in the early eighties, and unless you had a big name and/or a lot of cash to burn, your film was almost destined to rot in film quality hell. Such seems to have been the case with &quot;Private Lessons,&quot; and the fact that it is billed as a comedy rather than an adult movie bewilders me to no end. Even with the nudity, the filmography is agonizing to watch, but since this was probably produced as a &quot;quick buck&quot; teen-pleaser, that&apos;s not surprising. Panning shots of Kristel fondling or teasing Brown while the kid makes goofy, unrealistic &quot;shocked and amazed&quot; expressions are about as dynamic as this thing gets.\n\nI should also mention that the character of Philly&apos;s chubby friend (Patrick Piccininni) is simply the most irritating part of the movie in my opinion. Some people have commented that this character, who comes across as being doomed to remain a virgin for the rest of his life, is rather cute in his behavior, and I fail to see how they arrive at that judgment... as if one gawking teenage boy wasn&apos;t enough. Hesseman&apos;s character is strictly porno-level, period, end of story. Even Dan Greenburg, the author of the book this film is based on, had the ego to have a bit role as the hotel owner, even going so far as to appear fully credited in the &quot;profile&quot; shots of the cast during the closing credits! \n\nIt&apos;s hard to recommend &quot;Private Lessons&quot; for any other reason than the aforementioned Ms. Kristel and the fact that it is better than most soft-porn out there. Aside from these aspects, it&apos;s downright mediocre.",

Definitely not heavy going; light, fun, and great for the whole family."

Very soon we discover that O&apos;Brien&apos;s real job here is not building ships.\n\nThis WWII spy thriller has a bit of romance thrown in and features an assortment of characters whose personal and wartime lives often overlap:    Carole Landis and Ruth Warrick are both quite good as women doing jobs that take precedence--at least during wartime--over their personal lives or relationships. Landis is a fellow agent who poses as O&apos;Brien&apos;s wife; Warrick is Morris&apos;s assistant in the shipyard office. Morris would like to marry Warrick but she may still have feelings for her old flame, O&apos;Brien--whose professional regard for Landis may grow into something more. \n\nWallace Ford, always fun to watch, is part of &quot;the team&quot;--his main job being spotting Nazis at the shipyard. Barton MacLane is excellent as a rough-edged yard worker whose eventual friendship with O&apos;Brien is hard fought. \n\nThe plot is solid: O&apos;Brien and Ford keep an eye out for saboteurs while Morris and Warrick, realizing that O&apos;Brien is no ordinary dock worker, keep an eye on him. There&apos;s some comic relief that isn&apos;t too funny, unfortunately, and also some cute scenes involving a couple of war orphans that just aren&apos;t real convincing. \n\nIt&apos;s a great role for O&apos;Brien, though, as that rugged American everyman who doesn&apos;t say much but performs awesome feats.",

Sometimes that will to hurt each others when a relation is broken is justified.. but sometimes it isn&apos;t. Trust in a relationship, as this movie rightly observes, is not the simplest thing to attain, and sometime it&apos;s nearly impossible, despite the will of the partners..",

He is unable to tell anyone of his real intentions of inheriting 300 million by successfully blowing 30 million dollars in 30 days. As soon as he receives news he goes on a wild spending spree and recruits lawyers, security guards, decorators  etc. all at very inflated salaries. Eventually the word goes around and soon everyone is jostling to benefit from his generosity. Some of the people close to him are unnerved by his spending prowess and tries to help him acquire more money through investments which is exactly the opposite of what he wants. This all adds up to a series of very comical events which is most enjoyable to watch. Look out for the upcoming remake of this movie."

The film took advantage of this, of course, to avoid a &quot;stage&quot; feel. The perceptions, or rather the misperceptions, of people and motivations are well explored and portrayed. Ben Kingsley is a standout, for his interesting twist on the character Feste. In short, a good adaptation and film. Recommended.",

They actually did a pretty good job, although the book is much better.  The animation was nicely done, and I liked  the way the characters changed from life form to animated form- it gave the film a real surreal type of film.  The songs were quite poor, and were obviously aimed at the kids to &apos;liven&apos; things up a bit, after all some may say the  story ventures on the dark side of things. It&apos;s nice to see a film aimed at children that can also appeal to adults as well, although it does help that many of us are very familiar with Roald Dahl&apos;s stories.  In summary quite a good effort.",

The spare plot involves a search for a woman&apos;s missing husband which leads eventually to a diamond mine in a distant province. The safari braves assorted dangers along the way from wild animals and savage tribesmen, and the film captures the beautiful vistas of the African plains and exotic animals in their natural habitat. Richard Carlson is along as a member of the safari, as are two natives who provide fine characterizations as the plot unfolds. This picture doesn&apos;t have a music score but does have instead the drums and chants of the tribesmen that provide an authentic accompaniment to the film. Robert Surtees received an Academy Award for his excellent cinematography for this movie.",

However, one has to be in the right frame of mind. As a straight drama, it can be trite, uneven and a bit preposterous. But viewed as a kind of fascinating cultural time capsule with an over-the-top performance by Elizabeth Taylor as the scorned wife of a philandering Michael Caine, it can actually be quite entertaining and even hilarious. Never has any woman tried so hard to keep her man in the face of dire circumstances while simultaneously wreaking havoc on just about everyone. X, Y and Zee is a strange little film, but if you&apos;re a Taylor fan and don&apos;t mind overlooking a few flaws, you might find it quite entertaining and amusing. One thing for sure...this film belongs to Taylor; without her, it would be nothing.",

      "reviewBody": "I am not going to say too much about the movie because I don&apos;t want to present any &quot;spoilers,&quot; but I have to say this is one of the top action movies out, although very under the radar.\n\nI first watched Undisputed I without ever knowing what it was, just saw it lying around at my friends house and watched it. It caught me completely off guard. Then I watched the second and I just finished the third. It seems like as far as the plots and action sequences go, they keep getting better. The fighting moves or sequences they perform in this movie are crazy! One of the main reasons I love this film. The also, completely capture what Americans think of when we think of a Russian prison. Very accurate to what I picture in my mind. \n\nThe acting is rather good in this movie, in my opinion. Sure there are some cheesy comments but every movie has them. My only wish is that they would put Jason Statham in one of these movies. But I have to say I was more than pleased that they brought Boyka back to fight, since he lost in the last movie.\n\nOverall, very good movie if you are into movies like Bloodsport, or Kickboxer. I LOVED Bloodsport, and I was impressed how they copied Bloodsport as far as how the movie was set up, but was still so creative about the actual story line. Didn&apos;t take a ton of special effects and sex scenes to make it a great movie, the fighting was just phenomenal.",

      "reviewBody": "Another 9 1/2 Weeks (1997) \n\n1/2 (out of 4) \n\nWhat on Earth were they thinking? John Gray (Mickey Rourke) travels to Paris to try and track down Elizabeth but after learning that she&apos;s now married he starts up a relationship with a young fashion designer (Angie Everhart). I think 9 1/2 weeks in hell would be much more pleasant that trying to sit through this film. It has one of the worst reputations in the history of sequels and it&apos;s easy to see why. It would be like trying to make a Friday THE 13TH film but instead of violence, gore and Jason you threw in singing, good vibes and Barney the dinosaur. I&apos;m really not sure what the producers were thinking but this here is perhaps the most unerotic erotic movie ever made. They clearly were just wanted to cash in on the notoriety of the first movie and I understand that. I&apos;m fine that they were simply wanting to make money but for the life of me why would they deliver something like this? There&apos;s very little sex, little nudity and there&apos;s nothing erotic that happens. The majority of the overbearing 105-minute running time features the two stars just going into various clubs and getting in trouble. They flirt, they talk, they talk some more and then they go home to do nothing. Director Anne Goursaud might have been given an impossible task but she didn&apos;t help matters any. The pacing of the film is downright horrid, the lack of style just made for an ugly mess and I&apos;m really not sure why she decided to make everything so dark. The entire film just seems like a bad nightmare that you can&apos;t wake up from and this includes the two leads. Rourke and Everhart have zero chemistry together and Rourke appears bored out of his mind and wishing he was anywhere but in front of the camera. ANOTHER 9 1/2 WEEKS is a really bad movie on all levels and it&apos;s even poor when compared to much of the direct-to-Cinemax trash that was making the rounds during this period."

      "reviewBody": "David Lean&apos;s production of &quot;Ryan&apos;s Daughter&quot;is an outstanding piece of cinematic artistry.  It&apos;s a romantic drama set in a small village on the Irish coastline.  The mood of the villagers is as changeable as the waves that crash upon the shore.  David Lean uses the sea for dramatic effect as he alternates between the village people and the sea itself. John Mills as Michael the inquisitive village idiot is superb as we watch him play with a box of explosives.  Sarah Miles plays Rosy torn between the love for her Irish schoolteacher husband (Robert Mitchum) and an unbridled passion for a newly arrived British officer (Christopher Jones).  Village gossip virtually destroys Rosy&apos;s life.  Trevor Howard as the local much-respected priest gives a compelling performance as one who tries to keep the peace in a troubled village.  The shell-shocked officer with dreadful memories of his time in the trenches in France has a distinct presence on screen.  His part requires little dialogue, the emotions being portrayed through eye and body language. Some of the loveliest scenes I thought were those of the high cliffs and broad beaches where Rosy often walked alone with the incoming tide.Unfortunately footprints in the sand can reveal the most intimate secrets!  The wild storm in which the locals attempt to salvage boxes of ammunition from a shipwreck in raging seas is one of the most realistic and exciting sequences I have seen. We are reminded constantly in the film that the sea is the dominant player. Photography, sound effects and music blend into a perfect whole. In one word...a winner!",

      "reviewBody": "The first of a trilogy that really should be viewed as a whole. This elegant film tells of the very humble beginnings of Miyamoto Mushashi, who has become a paragon of Bushido and Giri. A Samurai&apos;s Samurai.\n\nHowever, you have no inkling of this at the beginning of the movie. What we see is dirt and squalor and a desperate chance to get out from beneath the mud. It all goes wrong and things look desperate.\n\nAs the movie progresses in the slow, methodical, often obtuse, Japanese fashion we become engrossed in the plot and the lives of our protagonists. Toshiro Mifune shows a vast range of emotion, power and character growth in these this movie. To get the full flavour of the story you must also watch the next two movies in this trilogy (2) &quot;Duel at Ichijoji Temple&quot;(1955) (USA)and (3) &quot;Duel on Ganryu Island&quot; (1956)(USA."

      "reviewBody": "Karl Volkin (Patrick Kilpatrick) is a vengeance-crazed Scanner who&apos;s escaped from prison, and is hellbent on striking back at heroic Scanner cop Samuel Staziak (Brad Dourif look alike Daniel Quinn). What he does to work towards this end is suck the life out of other Scanners, leaving them twisted, burning hunks of flesh. He hopes to become even more powerful than his nemesis, and stops at nothing.\n\nThis is actually a pretty good B movie, made with competence (if not flamboyance) at every level. Its story, concocted by Mark Sevi, is ultimately very routine, but director Steve Barnett does keep us entertained. It&apos;s amusing, as it always is with these movies, to watch actors make all manner of faces as they unleash their devastating mental abilities. Volkin leaves quite the trail of bodies behind him, so viewers can take comfort in a respectable body count, as well as some reasonably impressive (if protracted) makeup effects sequences devised by John Carl Buechler and his company.\n\nThe cast gives it their best effort. Quinn is a decent enough good guy, but he&apos;s outshone by veteran movie villain Kilpatrick, who&apos;s fun to watch. A number of recognizable actors pop up along the way, although Robert Forster is given precious little to do as Staziaks&apos; superior officer. Khrystyne Hage (&apos;Head of the Class&apos;), Stephen Mendel, Brenda Swanson, Jerry Potter, and Jewel Shepard (&quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot;) co-star, while Eugene Robert Glazer (&apos;La Femme Nikita&apos;), Allan Kolman (Cronenbergs&apos; &quot;Shivers&quot;), Aaron Lustig (&quot;Bad Channels&quot;), and none other than Kane Hodder have small parts.\n\nA worthy follow up to &quot;Scanner Cop&quot;.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "name": "In the piano duet, Betty literally plays the &quot;blue note&quot;.",
      "reviewBody": "In music, a &quot;blue note&quot; is a note which departs from the expected major scale and instead goes minor (flat). You&apos;ve heard it a million times in blues or jazz; it&apos;s &quot;that note&quot; that makes you go &quot;oooooooh&quot;. In the film &quot;Betty Blue&quot;, a meticulously crafted, deeply symbolic, allegorical tale of passion and madness, there&apos;s a wonderful scene where the 2 main characters slip away from a funeral wake in the middle of the night, find a room of pianos and play an impromptu duet. In this scene, the man and stable component of the relationship, Zorg, plays a chord progression while Betty, the volatile component, comes in with a simple melody hitting that powerful blue note.\n\nWhy am I harping on this one scene? It&apos;s because it shows how carefully planned and meaningful this film is right down to the music. And we haven&apos;t even touched the visuals: the incredibly surreal lighting, colors and set design, or the first class acting from everyone involved, or the hypercharged story itself. This is one of those films like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; which experts can spend decades dissecting on a technical as well as artistic level. Whether you approach it like that, or whether you just sit back and take in the experience, either way, this film works.\n\n&quot;Betty Blue&quot; is, on the surface, a love story. Underneath the surface it&apos;s the quintessential story of an artist and muse. Zorg is the artist (in this case, a failed writer) while Betty is the muse, a powerful, passionate force that suddenly drops in on him, adoring his simple scribblings to the point of obsessive madness, forcing her own passion upon him and driving him to write and believe in himself even though he barely knows or cares what he&apos;s doing. He simply wants to hold on to Betty as if his entire being depends on her because he knows what a rare force she is.\n\nIf you happen to be a writer, artist, musician, inventor, or anyone with creative leanings, you&apos;ll really grasp this angle. Even if you&apos;re not in those fields, you&apos;ll still grasp the story of a person who finds pure passion and will do anything to keep it.\n\nAlthough I&apos;m describing this story from Zorg&apos;s perspective, the movie is really about Betty. Zorg is almost just a bystander in his own life, experiencing the passion, volatility and violence of his lover. I thought this was a fantastic angle, even though you may be perplexed at his lack of reactions in some cases. For example early in the film Betty has a big flipout and throws all of Zorg&apos;s earthly belongings out the window. Zorg watches from afar with hilarious detachment, chatting calmly with a neighbor as if they&apos;re watching waves break on the beach. The film is full of surreal/comical moments like that, and that&apos;s what offsets the brutality of it all. Think of it: if your lover flipped out and destroyed everything you own, it probably wouldn&apos;t feel like a beautiful, artistic moment. But in this film it is. It&apos;s magnificent and oddly triumphant at the end of the scene.\n\nOk now the disclaimer: &quot;Betty Blue&quot; is a tough film for American audiences. This is mainly because there&apos;s a ton of very explicit nudity and sexuality bordering on softcore porn. Do NOT watch this with your parents. And for the love of all that&apos;s holy do NOT watch it with your kids. Honestly I wouldn&apos;t watch it with anyone because I would feel so uncomfortable. Full frontal nudity, both genders, kissing of private parts, and of course there&apos;s that opening scene: a brutally voyeuristic shot of the two having sex for a solid minute or two without any cuts, dialogue or distractions. But if you can handle that first scene, then your all set. Oddly enough, this film doesn&apos;t try to be erotic. It&apos;s hard to describe, but the explicit sex scenes convey passion without necessary getting bogged down in eroticism, thus avoiding any cheese factor that often comes when filmmakers try too hard to be sexy.\n\nIt may also be a difficult film for American audiences because it&apos;s just plain long (assuming you watch the 3-hr director&apos;s cut which you should). There isn&apos;t a clear, summarizable plot. The entire story is somewhat episodic and random, with sudden bizarre life changes happening that change the entire backdrop of the film. But this is precisely the point. Almost like a weird Alice in Wonderland fantasy, you have the main character(s) and everyone else is peripheral, everything surrounding them is surreal and inexplicable. This creates a sort of bubble around Betty and Zorg where we the audience feel what they feel: that the only thing that matters in the world is their love for each other.\n\nI highly recommend this film to anyone who goes to the cinema for more than thrills and popcorn. I would rank &quot;Betty Blue&quot; up there with other artistic masterpieces by Kubrick (&quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;) or Kieslowsky (Blue, White, Red Trilogy) or Wim Wenders (&quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;). All of these films are somewhat difficult to watch because they&apos;re not easily digestible entertainment, and unfortunately that&apos;s why they&apos;re not marketed here and you&apos;ll probably drop a few bills ordering a rare import copy, but it&apos;s worth it.",

This blurring is the point that is lost on the many people who question how this film can be part of Rivette&apos;s otherwise strikingly different oeuvre. This film is NOT the conventional adaptation of the novel it may seem to be at first glance. \n\nThroughout the film we sense the &quot;fate&quot; of the characters who have been preordained by Brontë&apos;s text to their gloomy fates - and ... yet - throughout the film we have glimpses of ways they could have escaped: the beauty of nature all around them, carefully observed in the cinematography, is one of these hints that &quot;fate&quot; could be simply a construct and that a different way of relating to what is &quot;given&quot; could open at any moment if the right conditions are met. Other potential &apos;escapes&apos; from their literary fates are suggested in dream sequences as well as in the glances characters give each other and their environment. In the sense of providing the anticipation and hint of that OPENING away from fate, the film is like &quot;Celine and Julie Go Boating,&quot; but in its own subtler way. A masterpiece.",

Let there be no doubt, there is a great subject for a plot here. Forget that its based on a true story because its not - that&apos;s just marketing and fodder for pointless forum discussions.\n\nWhat really hurt this movie were the pointless special effects and overly exaggerated sentimental shots, mostly featuring Meryl Streep, interspersed throughout the movie - typically after a scene where the protagonist experiences success or failure. There are only a handful of these shots and they only last seconds  but they are schmaltzy in an otherwise very believable movie. If you&apos;re watching even somewhat closely, they give away the movie very quickly.\n\nI&apos;ll bet Shi-Zheng Chen goes on eventually to make a truly great movie. This one is about half way there.",

Dabangg had some great jokes like &quot;Haathi k neechay agar Kuttay ki dumb ajaey&quot; and The one where Salman said &quot;Hum un kaminoo k bhaghwaan hain&quot; but this humor is missing in Dabangg 2. Salman Khan was Good and he did his part well but the other actors were not that good, Parkash raj&apos;s Role was too Small and he didn&apos;t had any good dialog&apos;s to deliver and his part looked a little experimental, he was try to change his voice, Arbaz khan and vinod khanna were just below okay and Sonakshi&apos;s Acting was average. All in all Dabangg 2 is a big disappointment.it will earn much more than Dabangg but its not even close to it when it come to entertaining and letting go Abhinav Singh Kashyap was a big mistake.If you are thinking about watching it Save your time and Go for Tom cruise&apos;s &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; or wait for &quot;Matru ki bijli KA Mandula&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "GARY COOPER is a dedicated Naval doctor during World War II tending to the wounded in Java where a shipload of men are wounded and expecting an attack by the Japanese. LARAINE DAY is the lovely woman he loves and who stands by him when the going gets rough.\n\nThe Technicolor photography is a big asset in making the war scenes more realistic and the men really look like damaged goods in their bandages and splints--two of whom are played by PAUL KELLY and DENNIS O&apos;KEEFE. O&apos;Keefe shares a wobbly, artificial sub-plot romance with a nurse (CAROL THURSTON) who looks after him. Ditto for SIGNE HASSO and ELLIOT REID. However, all of the scenes in the infirmary have an authentic look, thanks to DeMille&apos;s eye for detail.\n\nThe wounded men are full of high spirits and hi-jinks but Cooper is told that 60,000 Japs have landed in Java nearby and none of the wounded would have a chance to escape. It&apos;s up to him to devise a plan where he can help some of the wounded escape.\n\nThe action scenes are fine but there&apos;s too many lulls in between with clumsy use of flashbacks involving Wassell&apos;s romance with Laraine Day and some tediously repetitious scenes of wounded men suffering further wounds when the men try to make an escape with the aid of British troops.\n\nCertainly not a typical Cecil B. DeMille vehicle, but Cooper gives a decent performance. \n\nThe running time is too long because the flabby screenplay is sidetracked by poorly handled flashback segments. The sub-plot with Dennis O&apos;Keefe&apos;s character just doesn&apos;t work and the whole story takes too long to tell.",

      "reviewBody": "Again Hill as Cat Stevens and Spencer as Hutch Bessy team up against a baddie named Bill well played by Frank Wolff . Exciting western deals with a gunfighter robber hijacks a payroll train , kills everyone aboard and then stashes his loot . This violent Spaghetti Western oater goes on when Cat Stevens (Terence Hill or Mario Girotti) trying to save himself from a pursuit by nasties . Then meets Hutch (Bud Spencer or Carlo Pedersoli) who proposes him to discover the train robbing , allegedly committed by Bill St Antonio , and the two guys mess with Western baddies . Bill has been killed and holds on his tombstone an inscription captioning : ¨Here lies Bill St Antonio , greatest shot in the world killed by a traitor , otherwise no¨ and he receives a spectacular funeral in New Orleans style . Stevens reunites with Hutch joining forces, confronting baddies. Nevertheless , the heinous villain is alive and seeks revenge , he is a ruthless outlaw and supported by heinous henchmen .\n\nThe movie contains gunplay, action Western, bloody spectacle and fist-fights . Terence Hill as a tough gunslinger and Spencer as a bouncing hunk are good but still not personified the Trinity hero characters . At the picture appears usual Spaghetti secondaries who played ordinary characters as villains in numerous Spanish/Italian Western as Jose Luis Martin , Frank Braña , Jose Canalejas , Tito Garcia , Francisco Sanz and Luis Barboo , among others . The film belongs the Giuseppe Colizzi trilogy starred by Hill and Spencer as Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy . This one is the first , superior and the best outing ; the second installment is ¨Four gunmen of Ave Maria or Ace high ¨ with the great Elli Wallach and more camp tendencies ; and the third is ¨Boot Hill¨ with Woody Strode and less of a budget . The film is produced by DÁmbrossio and accompanied by a musical score by Carlo Rustichelli with an enjoyable leitmotif . The movie is finely photographed by Alfio Contini, and of course is shot in Almeria , Spain, location where were filmed hundreds Western in the 60s and 70s . This motion picture also titled ¨God forgives¨ will appeal to Hill and Spencer fans and S.W. aficionados.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s alright. \n\nThat&apos;s a perfect description. Should you watch it? Yes. But I&apos;d feel better about myself if I waited for this one and watched it at home.\n\nThis is a basic heist movie, but the details of the heist are not very clearly defined and presented to the audience. Oceans 11, Italian Job and the like really spell it out for you - in Contraband we just get a loose overview. The suspension of belief required in some areas of the movie just kind of deflates the entire film a bit. Not too much, just a bit. Maybe my expectations were too high?\n\nMarky Mark does a fine job and the movie is fine. It&apos;s enjoyable. But, it&apos;s not great. And I want great from Wahlberg because I&apos;ve gotten it before and I know he can do it. The other members of the cast range from passable to good, not great, except for Ribisi who really gets under your skin and delivers a menacing and chilling performance. No sex, but there are some beat &apos;em up scenes and graphic gun fights. The language is pretty clean overall - not unnecessarily vulgar at least.\n\nIn my opinion, Mark Wahlberg has been an inconsistent actor. He&apos;s had some high levels of success and other times it just seems like his movies are just OK. I wonder if he has internalized this and just works to collect a check... I don&apos;t know. I hope he frequently makes movies, but I also hope he makes a few more great ones, instead of just &quot;alright.&quot;\n\nWith all that being said, I was entertained. It&apos;s a fine movie and good enough for the movie theater. But again, if you&apos;re trying to maximize your $10.00, take a look at some of the other offerings this week.",

      "reviewBody": "This is another weird, wacky Japanese genre effort in the same vein as Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl and Robo-Geisha. The title says it all: a group of ancient Japanese ninja end up going claw to sword (and eventually sword to sword) with some monstrous aliens (that look suspiciously like people in moderately expensive Halloween costumes). \n\nThere&apos;s really no more story beyond that and a hinted at love triangle between two of the male shinobi and their female counterpart. Nothing about the &quot;aliens&quot; is explained, they just show up and start swiping people&apos;s heads off and fiercely trying to grab boobs. Alien vs Ninja isn&apos;t as gross or ultra-violent as many similar movies can be, but it does have its moments. People get ripped in half and have little mind-controlling aliens crawl up their noses, and plenty of pink pepto bismol alien blood flows all over the place. \n\nAvN won&apos;t win any awards for storytelling or production values, but it&apos;s a goofy and occasionally fun way to waste some time. There are better similar movies, but genre fans should find it worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I Dream Too Much,&quot; nicknamed &quot;I Scream Too Much,&quot; is a 1935 film starring opera singer Lily Pons and Henry Fonda, who at this point in his life resembled Jane Fonda in a man&apos;s haircut. He was really at the height of his most adorable-ness. Fonda plays a composer named Johnny Street who marries a young woman, Annette, only to discover that she has an operatic voice. In attempting to push his opera, she sings some of it for the head of the opera company in Paris. He makes her a huge star and Johnny is stuck on the sidelines. When he finds out that she is paying for a production of his opera, he leaves her.\n\nThis is a slight story no doubt prompted by the success of Jeanette MacDonald and Grace Moore that relies on the voice and personality of Lily Pons and the cuteness of Fonda. Eric Blore plays a neighbor who has a trained seal; he&apos;s there for comic relief, and he was always funny.\n\nPons was a huge opera star who actually sang for the last time in 1972, when she was 74 years of age! She was tiny at a time when opera stars ran very big, she was very glamorous, and her timing was impeccable - she arrived in America during the Depression and saved the Metropolitan Opera from bankruptcy. Her signature aria was the Bell Song from Lakme, an opera done infrequently today if at all. In it, she wore a bare midriff costume and showed off her F above high C and her coloratura technique. She was an ideal Rosina, Gilda, Lucia, Linda di Chamonix, etc. Women singers in those days were trained a little differently than they are today, with back placement of the high notes. Pons&apos; middle voice and extension above high C were lovely, but the notes from F to high C had a shrillness to them, at least in recording. Her speaking voice records shrilly as well.\n\nThis is actually a sweet film that the actors make enjoyable. I could have done without the long, dragging number at the end, but it&apos;s a chance to see one of opera&apos;s legends and a very young Fonda.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though some critics thought it might. Now this had a bad standing from the beginning. And while the actors are quite nice and the R-rating was secured (something fan boys really wished for), it did not make nearly as much money as it was supposed to. Or rather as much as the producers and the studio hoped for overall.\n\nAnd while this is layed out to warrant sequels, this probably won&apos;t happen. And it&apos;s almost a shame, because it isn&apos;t at all bad. The effects are good, the new Hellboy managed to stay afloat (which is quite an achievement if you think about the shoes he had to fill - or is it the horns?) - the story made sense too. But I guess there is a comic book fatigue to a degree. There are so many movies out there, that people pick and choose. Maybe there were other reasons too, but in the end it doesn&apos;t really matter ... speaking of endings: there is one mid credit scene and one after credit scene. So if you watch it, watch it proper",

Having survived an air crash , one of the survivors visits the bereaved families of three fellow passengers with whom he had become friendly during the fateful flight . Five great stars in a masterpiece of bold and beloved emotions !\n\nAn interesting and decent but hardly ever outstanding dramatic compendium , dealing with a simple and plain plot about a survivor after a plane accident visits the families of three of the victims whom he met during the flight , being paced in good sense , sensibility and with plenty of emotion . Maudlin and adorable film with emotion , deep feeling and and intense drama . Compellingly performed by a nice main cast as Gary Merrill , Shelley Winters , Michael Rennie and Keenan Wynn .These great stars being well accompanied by a good support cast , such as : Evelyn Varden , Warren Stevens, Beatrice Straight , Craig Stevens , John Doucette , Nestor Paiva and Helen Westcott . Brief appearance by George Nader as a pilot and Bette Davis , then Gary Merrill&apos;s wife, shows up in a subordinate role as Keenan Wynn&apos;s spouse and moves things up a gear or two .\n\nBeing well written and produced by Nunnally Johnson. Displaying a stirring and memorable musical score by classic composer Franz Waxman . Equally , an atmospheric and evocative cinematography by Milton R. Krasner. This agreeable and sentimental weepie was competently directed by Jean Negulesco . This classy Hollywood director Jean Negulesco was an elegant and brilliant filmmaker who made notorious films with penchant for Musical, Comedy and Drama, such as : The invincible six, The best everything, Daddy long legs, Three coins in the fountain, How to marry a millionaire, Titanic, Phone call from a stranger, A woman&apos;s world, Three came home , Road house, Humoresque, among others. And of course his successful Belinda with the Oscarized Jane Wyman. Phone Call from a Stranger (1952) rating : 7.5/10. Better than average.",

It is a shame they didn&apos;t cast Glynis Johns in the stage role she created, she would have been perfection as the flighty, melancholy aging actress and she and Hermoine Gingold make sense as mother and daughter. Hermoine and Elizabeth Taylor bear no resemblance in either feature or gesture making it even harder to get into the material. Diana Rigg, Hermoine Gingold and Len Cariou do what they can with their parts and the settings are lovely but the direction is flat, in this sort of whimsy that is deadly.

It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren&apos;t part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. Watching him in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances. True, there are a few songs missing that I would like to have seen on there, but like any album it can&apos;t have everything. I just bought this in 2006, but if I would have know it came out in 1972, I would have definitely bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash!",

Instead... we watched a train wreck. Both of us kept looking at each other in disappointment as we started to fall asleep. About 50 Minutes into it we actually walked out. We had to. We Both wanted to! This thing just wasn&apos;t getting any better. I have never walked out of a movie in my entire life..... until this movie came on the screen. The Movie &quot;Being Human&quot; is truly Horrible. However I do recommend that you Rent it just so that you can see how horrible it is for yourself. I highly recommend it for people who have trouble falling asleep. When pills won&apos;t work..... This movie will."

      "reviewBody": "This is a thrilling and stirring adventure based on Karl May novel with two agreeable characters as Old Shatterhand and Winnitou, being stunningly played by Lex Barker and Pierre Brice respectively . It deals with Mabel Kingsley (Karin Dor who married to director Harald Reinl) arrives at a western little town to clear her missing daddy of the charge that he robbed a shipment of government gold. A scout known as &quot;Shatterhand&quot; (Lex Barker) agrees to escort her in a search for the gold and for clear the disappeared father . They are joined by an army party , an amateur botanist (Arent) and an old partner (Wolter) .There is also an officer from the Army helping the group and he falls in love with the girl in an enjoyable love story . Then there takes place an emotive meeting between and Winnitou (Pierre Brice) and Old Shatterhand when on a cliff edge Winnitou saves him . Old Shatterland and his faithful half-brother are on the trail to discover the gold charge . In spite of troubles caused by bandits led by Murdock (Rik Battaglia who acted as good guy in ¨Winnitou and Old Firehand¨) and a Sioux chief , Winnetou&apos;s enemy, they get escape . Old Shatterhand set out on pursuit of the bandits and prepares them a trap . But when Shatterhand rides for Sioux help against Murdock&apos;s gang who captured their companions, he finds the tribe&apos;s friendly chief succeeded by his hostile son Red Buffalo (Voyo Goric who starred various Indian roles), who proves to be a dangerous enemy . Winnitou then fights against Red Buffalo in an exciting combat . Mabel&apos;s party eventually reaches the dangerous ¨Valley of snakes¨ and after that the &quot;Valley of Death&quot; which holds the answers to the mystery of the missing father and hidden gold . At the end takes place a silly epilogue by means of explosions and fire with no much sense .\n\nThis is a passable episode about one of the series of popular German made Western , featuring the duo formed by valiant ¨Old Shatterhand¨ who agrees to guide the motley group trough Osage Indian territory and immortal ¨Winnetou¨ , both of them repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always . This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures , shootouts , explosions , larger-than-life characters and spectacular scenarios shot in-Atelier, Spandau, Berlin, Germany ,Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA ,Ivanica, Dubrovnik, Croatia ,Popovo Polje, Roski falls, Yugoslavia ,Zrmanja canyon, Croatia and Zubci, Trebinje, Yugoslavia .\n\nWinnetou-Pierre Brice repeats , as usual, his excellent and unforgettable role to be continued in a TV series . Lex Barker scores especially high marks , though he plays as a serious and intelligent frontierman . Enjoyable relationship between Old Shatterhand and Winnetou is quite match . The highbrow Lex Barker played the most part of series : ¨Apache gold (1963)¨ by Harald Reinl, ¨Apaches last Battle (1964)¨ by Hugo Fregonese, ¨Last of renegades(1964)¨, ¨The desperate trail¨, ¨Old Surehand¨ (1965) directed by Alfred Vohrer, ¨Old Shatterland(1966)¨ by Harald Philipp, ¨In the valley of death(1968)¨ by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions , he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland , he plays with mirth and liking manner as ¨Among vultures¨ and ¨Winnetou and Surehand¨ . Besides Rod Cameron starred only one : ¨Old Firehand¨ in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . Nice support cast such as the customary nasty Rik Battaglia as Murdock , Karin Dor as Mabel Kingsley and the series usual Ralf Wolter as Sam Hawkens . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching , sensitive musical score ,though with excessive use of synthesizer by Martin Bottcher , series&apos; ordinary , being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Rialto Productions was professionally directed by Harald Reinl who directed various Karl May titles , besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi - Edward Wallace adaptation- and realized another Western titled ¨The last Mohican¨ . Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous landscapes and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia and Grand Canyon National ,Arizona , USA.",

When she meets another boy (Marc Michel,who ,like Chakiris ,worked with Demy (&quot;Lola&quot; )) who works in a printing house -and writes in leftist propaganda newspaper ,she hardly understands what he does -except that it might help bring her love back from exile.\n\nMara lives in a romantic world ,a motionless world ,she identifies with the heroine of &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (played by Vivien Leigh) a movie she saw in the local theater .She&apos;s deluding herself and even in the final scenes she is the heroine still waiting for her hero to come back....even though if it&apos;s not sure that means happiness to her.She also feels guilt -although once again Bube is a macho (the scene in the restaurant where he starts eating without waiting for her) and probably ever will.But Comencini was often a pessimistic director who did not trust the grown-ups.Hence his love for children ,the only positive characters in his best films.There&apos;re no children in &quot;La Ragazza&quot; .",

      "reviewBody": "Father Malachias, offended by the bar and brothel next to his church, prays the building (and all its inhabitants) onto a rock in the North Sea. What follows proves to be more than the padre bargained for.\n\nBased on the book by the Scots writer, Bruce Marshall, this movie was directed by Berhard Wicki--easily one of West Germany&apos;s best post-war directors. Wicki uses a technique of having the camera follow various people talking as they cross paths that Fellini would put to even better use a couple years later in &quot;8½.&quot; the tone of the film is similar to Billy Wilder&apos;s &quot;Ace in the Hole,&quot; with a harsh cynicism toward the human tendency to exploit events for profit.\n\nThe films stars Horst Bollmann. This is his first film, and it shows. He would eventually become a good actor, but here he was still learning his craft--under fire, so to speak. Wicki reportedly finished this film only seven hours before it premiered, and this shows as well. The film has a few rough spots and scenes that could have used retakes. Nonetheless, the film is fun to watch and stands as a one of the better films to come out of Germany during the sixties.",

Let&apos;s clarify:\n\nIn 1914, &quot;Der Golem&quot; was filmed. This movie dealt with the resurrection of the Golem in modern times. Known in the USA as &quot;The Monster of Fate&quot;, it is considered a lost film. Only about a minute or so survives, somewhere in Germany. Rumors have circulated for years of a single, surviving print - but this seems to be untrue.\n\nThe 1920 film was actually Wegener&apos;s &quot;prequel&quot; - a film set totally in period, dealing with the creation of the clay being by Rabbi Loew, and how it is brought to life.\n\nThe 1920 film is, in my opinion, a must-see; the earlier film is pretty much lost. It is important, however, that we not confuse these two motion pictures."

      "reviewBody": "Takashi Miike&apos;s City of Lost Souls (also known as Hazard City, 2000) is very different due to its multi nation cast which includes Russians, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and some others. The protagonist is Mario who is a Japanese/Brazilian who has beautiful Chinese girlfriend Kei who he frees in the outrageous beginning of the movie from some immigration system. Then they try to get out of Japan, but before they can, they have to deal with crazy Yakuza members, Mario&apos;s ex-girlfriend and her little girl and irritating radio host. This film reminds distantly of Guy Ritchie&apos;s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so that gives a clue how much things happen in this film; you&apos;re right, a lot.\n\nThis is one wild ride to experience and even though it&apos;s not the director&apos;s masterpiece, it&apos;s still very interesting film and personal to say the least. The film is full of details to be found and crazy ideas, and Takashi is definitely among the most interesting directors of today. There are long takes without edits, weird and crazy camera angles (the toilet!), wild action scenes, CGI and some outrageous gags mostly towards some Hollywood blockbusters like The Matrix. The cockfight scene is totally unbelievable and I&apos;d like to know what do the Wachowsky brothers think about this film! The very menacing &quot;blade&quot; effect at the end is again very personal and the kind of crazy idea one could expect from this director and Japanese cinema in general. The violence and action is very comic book like and thus not too shocking nor disturbing and that&apos;s not even the purpose. Fudoh (1995) is far more serious film and very masterful piece of Yakuza genre and alongside Audition (1999), it is Takashi&apos;s masterpiece.\n\nCity of Lost Souls raises some interesting topics mostly about different races and how we after all are very similar no matter what &quot;race&quot; or nation we belong to. All the characters are more or less tragicomic and show that there&apos;s absolutely no culture or person in the world who could be described as &quot;perfect&quot; or without flaws; people in City of Lost Souls are selfish, stupid, violent and proud of themselves so these are exactly the same things which plague every human being in the world. These things are not necessarily active in every case, but they&apos;re still there &quot;un-active&quot; and waiting for some stimulation to become active because, in my opinion, they belong to human nature, whether we wanted to accept it or not. City of Lost Souls tells many thins about us humans, but it tells them with little like tongue in cheek and with plenty of humor and lightening elements and so the film becomes even more interesting. The same case is with Mario Bava&apos;s slasher classic Bay of Blood aka Twitch of the Death Nerve (1971), which is a horror film on one level, but ends up being a hilarious satire and black comedy during the end, and the final scene in Bava&apos;s film is very memorable and, in a way, little similar to Takashi&apos;s film&apos;s end and how and why Kei and Mario end up like that. \n\nCity of Lost Souls is very easy to watch many times due to its creative content and over-the-top personal director, who hopefully manages to make more interesting films for many years to come. It is ridiculous but also sad how many just think this is some non-sense director whose films are so good just because of their often strong violence and other shock elements. Takashi Miike is another great talent in the growing list of Japanese talents, and his films are far more than many manage to understand and see.\n\n 8/10",

The music is secondary to Paul letting everyone know how great he is and explaining how he makes his music. As Frank Zappa once said &quot;Shut up and play your guitar&quot; This DVD is good if you are looking for a documentary from a great artist. But if you want to see him perform, find another DVD of his live music. Some of the music is lip syncing and a little is him playing to a crowd. But most of the time he cuts in to let everyone know how he did what it is you are hearing."

      "name": "The drama of dying of cancer made into a (boring) comic book",
      "reviewBody": "In &quot;Death of a Superhero&quot;, Donald (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) wants to be a superhero when he grows up. That&apos;s not going to happen because Donald is dying of cancer. He&apos;s trying to balance his survival/mortality rate with his coming-of-age interest in girls and sex. It&apos;s a drama about cancer, comic books, superheros, thanatologists, and teenage boys. It&apos;s an interesting mix which results in an odd, quiet, and unfortunately uninteresting film.\n\nOn paper it can be compared to &quot;50/50&quot; (2011) but it has a completely different tone and feel which makes it less palpable. It&apos;s like &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010) but with less action, more comic book drawings, and less humour. And I mean that as a good thing. I think. This is a very slow-moving film about a depressed teenager who draws out his superhero and superheroine fantasies. I think it would have been easier to take if he really did fall or jump off the bridge that he teetered on the edge of. It started getting more entertaining when he met a girl and she elevated his graffiti to revealing heights. But, as it has a tendency of doing, cancer slowed that down.\n\nRemember the cute and only slightly annoying kid from &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003) and then remember the knowing laugh of amusement when he appeared as a young Paul McCartney in &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; (2009)? This is your chance to see him in a very impressive dramatic role. The other stand-out was Andy Serkis as the thanatologist hired by Donald&apos;s parents to help him and themselves deal with his impending death. For all intents and purposes, let&apos;s call him a therapist. It&apos;s the usual character which all of these types of movies have, but there was something more here which I can&apos;t quite put my finger on which grabs your attention and then makes you bookmark his IMDb page.\n\nThe drawings were insanely impressive; unfortunately, I&apos;m not one for comic book stylings. &quot;Death of a Superhero&quot; is certainly a good film that I appreciated, but I can&apos;t say I liked it.",

      "reviewBody": "The latest slice of period drama to grace our screens is this biopic on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who during the 1770s was patroness of the Whig party and prisoner of a marriage which made her, among other things, suffer the indignity of having her husband&apos;s mistress living under the same roof. These heritage dramas are an industry all by themselves; the armies of prop hirers, wig and costume makers, researchers, production designers, location scouts and (mostly) British actors who go to make them must find themselves in almost permanent employ. The BBC does them, the Americans have a go at them, and the public can&apos;t seem to get enough of them. The Duchess is a superior example of the genre, though nowhere in the league of Kubrick&apos;s Barry Lyndon, and combines the spectacle of Keira Knightley looking glamorous in a range of frocks and wigs, while at the same time honing her acting talents (no more those rictus grins), with the guilty pleasure of following the uncomfortable parallels between the fortunes and indiscretions of the ancestress of Lady Diana Spencer with those of the Princess of Wales herself. Lowering over the whole proceedings is the truly superb presence of Ralph Fiennes&apos;s Duke of Devonshire, Fiennes an actor who can convey polite discomfiture or threatening ire with slightest twitch of the mouth. In his hands the Duke becomes far less a melodramatic villain than a product of his time, and you almost feel sorry for him. Go and see The Duchess; only those who have had children will balk at the liberties taken with childbirth and breastfeeding. But not even that will spoil the fun.",

I don&apos;t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is certainly loud and violent but it&apos;s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he&apos;s done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",

      "reviewBody": "Plot In A Paragraph: Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) pursue a former L.A.P.D. lieutenant turned ruthless arms dealer, during the six days prior to Murtaugh&apos;s retirement.\n\nThere is a massive drop in quality from the first two movies, and I think it is not helped by a lame villain. Rene Russo is a good addition to the cast though. This is a much watered down Lethal Weapon movie compared to the first two movies, and for this Zoner, Lethal Weapon 3 is the low point of the franchise for me. The lack of Shane Black is obvious. They up the comedy even more this time, and it falls a bit flat for me. The humour in the first two was great, this has a female security guard chasing Murtaugh around whilst Riggs is tricking him into kicking water coolers over. \n\nRiggs is an absolute jerk at times in this one!! Gone is the man overcome with grief, looking for a reason to get through the day and is dangerously unpredictable as a result. Instead we get someone who eats raw onions and dog biscuits, threatens Jaywalkers with his gun, beats up movie directors, knocks out handcuffed suspects and makes random guesses on what Wire to cut on a bomb!! And that&apos;s without mention his treatment of his best friend and partner Murtaugh.\n\nHe constantly berates him about retiring despite it being the sensible option. Especially since he can&apos;t dress himself without accidentally setting off his gun. Riggs repeatedly put him in unnecessary danger. Surely Riggs should want his best friend safe at home with his family, out of danger. But no, he is incredibly selfish!! \n\nJoe Pesci who I loved in the last one, is awful here. There is no reason for him to be here and he&apos;s just irritating. \n\nDoes the movie director Riggs assaults remind anyone of Steven Spielberg?? \n\nLethal Weapon 3 grossed $144 million to finish the 4th highest grossing movie of 1992.",

In any case the heroine, played by Molly Ringwald, evinces no sympathy and the viewer winds up not caring what happens to her. Any emotion in this movie is displayed by the killer who is introduced as a new character in the last five minutes of the movie. His acting ability is displayed like the actors of the silent movie era where the back of the hand is thrown up to the forehead in despair. This movie deserves to be locked away in the annals of movie-making dreck."

The story makes little sense (note: I have not read the antecedent manga) but Aikawa&apos;s character is likable, the &apos;action sequences&apos; are fun, there are some comical scenes (I particularly liked the victim of Zebraman&apos;s deadly back-kick) and the film has a goofy low-budget appeal (especially for viewers who pick up on the meta-humour and the tokusatsu in-jokes).",

      "reviewBody": "Can anything new be added to the seemingly endless cycle of big screen gangster movies? Maybe not, judging by this lavish, overlong tribute to mobster Ben &apos;Bugsy&apos; Siegal. In a role perhaps written with Warren Beatty in mind, the title character is presented as a charming, vain, lecherous wannabe actor with a weakness for Hollywood glamour, which if true would make this film his dream come true. Typical for director Barry Levinson it&apos;s a big, glossy production, well cast with reliable talent and tailor made for Oscar consideration, with plenty of domestic melodrama and backstage romance, plus a memorable, histrionic death scene for its star. The script by James Toback opens strong, but fatally softens Siegal&apos;s lethal character (after only one frightening temper tantrum) by concentrating more on the underworld myth of the man who &apos;discovered&apos; Las Vegas. Even more damaging is the heavy-handed comedy, which drags the film away from its subject into something uncomfortably close to parody.",

An interesting, rather complex plot, and it&apos;s good and dark, something many of those other films lack.\n\nI really liked the ending as well, not really what one expects from this kind of film and the final shot is quite memorable.\n\nAs far as this era of action films go, its an 8. In the bigger picture, still gets a six from me for being above average. Which is saying a lot, because most of these 80&apos;s/90&apos;s mercenary/military movies are 4&apos;s.\n\nI first saw this on a tape of old cheesy movies a friend had made when they were a kid, and was surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it. I remember being quite creeped out during a scene where you see the effects of a deadly nerve gas on people. Check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "Tall, handsome Vittorio Gassman stars as Peppe, the womanizing glass-jawed palooka who, along with several keystone criminals, stumblebum their way to...not much. Also featured in this comedy by Italian film legend Mario Monicelli are Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale, who would go on to fame and fortune, but here have only modest parts. Mastroianni, who would later star in La Dolce Vita (1960), Il Bell&apos;Antonio (1960), Divorzio all&apos;italiana (1961) and many others, plays Tiberio a photographer without a camera, whose wife is in jail, who has a constantly crying baby to take care of with one of his arms up in a sling with a board under it. Cardinale, who would go on to become one of Italy&apos;s most famous beauty bombshells, plays Carmelina, a young woman locked up by her brother in order to protect her honor until she marries.\n\nAlso featured are Carla Gravina (Nicoletta), a very pretty 17-year-old who went on to only a modest career, and the veteran Toto who plays the incompetent safecracker, Dante Cruciani. Notable is Renato Salvatori as Mario who wins Carmelina&apos;s heart, Memmo Carotenuto as Cosimo who fails at purse-snatching, and Carlo Pisacane as Capannelle who looks like an aged member of the Bowery Boys.\n\nThe story begins when Cosimo is caught trying to steal a car. In prison he learns of a nice sting that he can pull off if only he can get out of jail. So he tries to hire a scapegoat to confess to the crime so he can be freed. Finally Peppe, after getting knocked out in the first round of a prize fight, decides he needs the money. However when he goes to confess, the police see through the ruse and throw him in jail without releasing Cosimo. But Peppe does get out, and he and the motley assortment of would-be jewel thieves plot their crime amid hilarious missteps, pratfalls and mass confusion as they break into an apartment that they have the keys for to knock down a wall (which wall?) to gain access to a safe they probably can&apos;t crack. Will they succeed despite all the mishaps? There is a sense of both recovery and poverty in post World War II Italy in the backdrops and the asides and the circumstances of the characters that lend to this comedy a realistic edge. We see the petty thievery as an understandable and almost acceptable way of life, at least for the time being. Mario always buys or steals three identical things for his &quot;mother&quot; who turns out to be three women who raised him at the orphanage. Tiberio has to sell his camera and then steal one. Skinny Capannelle is always eating. And in the jail several men share one cigarette while they blow the smoke into a bottle to capture it so that others might get a little nicotine as well! (Sure, and I have some gum I can recycle.) The Criterion Collection DVD that I viewed has excellent yellow subtitles, but some of the lines come so fast and with such comedic as well as denotative intent that it is easy to miss something. Knowing Italian would help! See this for all the &quot;bumbling criminal&quot; movies that it both imitated and inspired, and for the fine work by the talented cast.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

      "reviewBody": "I watched this under the title Dating Santa. Between the title and the actors and settings, it appears to be a foreign (to USA) film. I even wondered if the actors filmed the movie in Spanish and then used English voice overs, but the lips appear to be in sync with the words mostly in English. The closed caption, however, had a lot of discrepancies.\n\nIn the beginning of this movie, I thought it was going to be great. The lead, Lucia, is very appealing, at least at first. The two lead actors have great chemistry and the dialog is lively. At first, the daughter, Leo, looks like she is going to be a cutie. Mom is able to stay out all night on a date and greats her daughter amicably upon waking. Clearly the plot is going to be more than so many other Christmas movies.\n\nThen it crashes and burns, all because of that little cutie. It is not unusual for a single mom to be especially doting with her little girl. It is not surprising if she is a little spoiled and tyrannical. But when Leo meets the boyfriend, she throws an absolute tantrum and Lucia caves completely, willing to give the child anything she wants. This, of course, is how the movie sets up the need for Sergio to impersonate Santa. I just wish it had been done without making Leo such a spoiled brat. Also, it almost seems that the mom and child are more in sync than the romantic leads.\n\nThese things smooth out as the movie goes on and it becomes a comedy about the ruse to make Sergio into Santa and the place they are visiting into the North Pole. Leo remains a bit manipulative but not as tyrannical as she was.\n\nIf Leo doesn&apos;t turn you off, this could be a fun movie. If she does turn you off, it does get better, but leaving a little sour taste behind.",

      "reviewBody": "Enter the Void is exactly the kind of polarizing film that cinema needs right now. Too many films these days play it safe, being concerned with keeping the audience comfortable, safe and happy. Enter Gaspar Noe, who clearly has no regard either for the well-being of either the audience or his actors. We have antagonistically long (but brilliant) takes, beginning in an apartment and ending in a bar, several blocks over. We are given characters and are exposed to their darkest moments, but are never given a real reason to care for them, or to perceive them as anything but wretched. We are also shown some sexually discomforting things that we never really wanted to see on the silver screen (if you&apos;ve seen it you probably know what I&apos;m talking about). Also, the film is almost completely in first-person viewpoint, so you&apos;re constantly feeling confined to what Oscar is looking at, which are mostly psychedelic images. In effect, the feel and tone of the story are immediately off-putting for the viewer, but since you&apos;ve already bought a ticket, what can you do but follow it through? \n\nThis is definitely the kind of film that can be approached in the wrong way, both with the medium that you view it through, and with your state of mind. Enter the Void is meant to be a transportive film (i.e. you living directly in the viewpoint of another, and feeling how that person feels, and perhaps even thinking how that person thinks). To technically maximize the experience, the film should really be experienced on the big screen. I&apos;d imagine an IMAX screen to be ideal.\n\nI also think a film like Enter the Void really needs to be approached with a separate set of goals than that of a normal film. First of all, chuck any notions of entertainment, or even enjoyment, out the window. While you&apos;re at it, remove any notions of positivity that you can think of. The only reactions that Enter the Void will draw from you are negative ones. Personally, the only emotion I consistently felt was a slight nausea, tinted with the occasional horror, or perhaps a shameful arousal, as there is excessive sexual content that is all wretched in one way or another.\n\nThe film is shot with a certain frame of mind, and sticks to it with remarkable faith. It&apos;s in the point of view of a small group of friends who are confined to the drug and clubbing scenes in Tokyo. He then films them in the most abrasive ways possible, showering the viewer in infinite neon lights, and fish-eyed close-ups, and then Noe lets his frames linger on these unsightly images for uncomfortably long. Even with his tracking shots moving from one location to another, when the viewer is normally given a moments rest, he rapidly cuts across hallways, stairs, and streets, and never gives the viewer a free moment to settle down.\n\nDespite the film&apos;s antagonistic feel, and despite the physical and psychological discomforts that the film drew from me, I still found Enter the Void to be a worthwhile and even inspirational experience. More to the point, Enter the Void may not be a friendly experience, but this exact kind of experimentation and determined expression are just what cinema needs in order to be taken seriously as an artistic medium, when so many other directors air on the side of caution and safety. It might be a difficult ride, but just watch it once and you&apos;ll carry it with you forever.",

He makes many mistakes, but you can see how he cares very much. The love he has for Sarah is very real. I felt so sorry for Sarah but I also knew that she was a survivor.

With a story that could&apos;ve been plucked straight from the pages of the famous European western comic Lucky Luke, Les Petroleuses is an irreverent euro-western cartoonish spectacle from start to finish, a low-brow comedy populated by stock characters and silly slapstick but still fairly entertaining as far as these films go. What really makes it worthwhile however is the screen presence of Bardot and Cardinale, none of which have to stretch their acting muscles to earn their paycheck, except look as gorgeous as possible. Seeing Bardot&apos;s bare buttocks and Cardinale doing a song number dressed in a skimpy cabaret outfit probably helped quite a lot.\n\nInteresting to note is that Les Petroleuses plays like a male sex fantasy of female supremacy. Bardot plays notorious train robber Frenchie King, leader of four black-clad European babes, while Cardinale is in charge of a ranch and her four idiot brothers. All the men in the movie are stupid and incompetent buffoons, chief among them the sheriff who is a bumbling fool always running after his horse and Cardinale&apos;s perennially horny brothers. The women are sassy, bossing the men around and outsmarting them at every turn. Buxom beauty Cardinale has an old Indian housekeeper while Blond vixen Bardot has a black manservant (who calls the Indian his &quot;red brother&quot;). Both Cardinale and Bardot have the goofy sheriff wrapped around their finger. At one point Bardot kidnaps Cardinale&apos;s brothers, has them tied and stripped naked before her and rains buckshot on their bare asses! In the end, the sheriff drops his star and gunbelt on the floor and sighs in admission of defeat that &quot;the west ain&apos;t no place for a man&quot;.\n\nYou can guess the conclusion from sheer arithmetics alone and the movie is pretty crude from a technical standpoint, but eurowestern fans will have a ball seeing two of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen duking it out for crude petrol."

      "reviewBody": "An unashamedly romantic film of Heinz Ruemann performed by a magnificent cast headed by Hertha Feiler, Hans Soehnker, Hans Nielsen and Susanne von Almassy. There is also a marvellous turn as a manservant by Erich Ponto who steals all of his scenes. Tremendous production values and an excellent score by Ruemann&apos;s favoured composer Werner Bochmann. Adapted from a play the script is by Helmut Weisse who directed Ruemann in one of his most popular films &apos;Die Feuerzangenbowle&apos;. There is invariably a darker side to Third Reich films of course. One reads that the glorious Hertha Feiler, being a quarter Jewish, was only granted permission to work by virtue of being Ruemann&apos;s wife. Hans Soenker was apparently on the Nazi blacklist for his pro-Semitic activities. Compare Ponto&apos;s comic performance here with his terrifying portayal of Lord Talbot in Ucicky&apos;s flagrantly propogandist &apos;Das Madchen Johanna&apos;. This should hopefully not lessen one&apos;s enjoyment of this delightful, charming and totally captivating film. Let us just be thankful for it.",

      "name": "Short and sharp covering of one woman&apos;s plight, which effectively applies cinematic devices to immerse the viewer in her tale.",
      "reviewBody": "The oppositional documentary entitled Enemies of Happiness wastes no time in laying out its hand in detailing the core of what it&apos;s about. In beginning with a political discussion-come-seminar in Afghanistan during which individual rights for women are at the forefront and the consequent anger the men exhibit at this, the piece establishes what it will come to revolve around; the problems the item faces and a general sense of politically infused content in starting in an assembly of sociological type. What follows is a tale of one woman, a true tale, of Afghan born female politician Malalai Joya and her plight in attempting to bring about a degree of gender equality where previously there was none. Her tale is a tale of personal belief but met with hostility; and through a camera crew whom it&apos;s believed has ties to Danish production companies, we follow her around for a certain number of months over the course of two years. In brief, we are immersed in her plight; frightened by the reactions of certain others within; saddened at some times but are still permitted to come away feeling rather joyous.\n\nThe documentary is like most recent films from The Middle East covering this subject of women&apos;s rights or gender equality, films that predominantly herald from the nation of Iran and that sees a very down to Earth; borderline neo-realist approach applied to a tale of a woman or young girl venturing from place to place in a Middle Eastern world just wanting to engage in the sorts of activity that comes so easily to her male counterparts, because of their gender, but usually failing in the long run. The films of this canon have always carried that odd balance between true to life tale and out-and-out film designed to raise awareness but ultimately dramatically involve us, first and foremost, in the plight of a protagonist. Few will question as to whether Jafar Panahai&apos;s Offside, which was released in 2006, works as a film – because it most certainly does, but one must remember the manner in which it was shot and that it was based on a true to life event anyway, thus blurring lines between what is a dramatic piece of fiction about the plight of a central character which lasts 90-odd minutes and what is actually a pseudo-documentary piece with larger things on its agenda.\n\nOn the other hand, Enemies of Happiness is most certainly a documentary; a piece about a real person I did not know existed prior to seeing it and actually thought it was a fiction film until its reality sank in. It subscribes to that Middle Eastern film making philosophy of shooting everything around a central female, here not wanting to go to a football match or to school (alá Buddha Collapsed Out of Shame) or whatever, but to move into politics and encourage feminism as well as gender equality in the nation of Afghanistan. In short, it does it really rather well. Joya begins with speaking directly into the camera, a verbal promise that she must leave her current zone and get out and about to spread the word when a sense of danger feels prominent. That was 2003, the documentary then jumping forward about a year and half and to 2005; a time in which we are suddenly greeted with the lead on a series of wanted posters complete with baying protesters seemingly wanting her borough to some kind of justice so as to stop the madness she&apos;s inflicting.\n\nThe film unfolds in a dry, dusty and hostile locale; flies buzz around its inhabitants and television and radio updates talk of attacks on the British soldiers, American soldiers and collaborating Afghan&apos;s located there. Hostility towards, and awareness of, unwanted people or items in certain forces seemingly attempting to come in and change ways of life or the nation itself is everywhere; nobody said Joya&apos;s quest would be easy. She visits a number of people, an elderly man has worn and blistered hands as a result of working in construction with the camera capturing the results of such graft and projecting such a scenario onto that of our female lead as she herself attempts to construct something in the form of an existence for women that&apos;ll surely see similar results of the strain manifest. One other such visit sees the documentary again draw on parallels to Joya&apos;s struggle, specifically, an interview covering that of an elderly woman; a woman with a tale of heroism in the face of death as she recounts her exploits against the invading Soviets during their war of the 1980s. Joya&apos;s own plight in the face of adversity is itself a war of sorts, a gender war; a war of traditional values against contemporary beliefs fought not with anti-tank mines, bolt action rifles and Kalashnikov rifles but with words and belief in a cause.\n\nJoya is a living embodiment of the antithesis to the regime that rules her nation and the rules that they govern with. She addresses the camera, listing in a stark fashion the negatives of the current ruling bodies and how she would love to expose and expel them; the technique eerily echoes that of certain other basic, piece to camera recordings in front of blank backgrounds, those that are designed to strike fear into the West as threats and anti-life messages are broadcast from organisations within the nation. With Joya&apos;s speakings, the aesthetic and basic construction of the piece is the same but the content the complete opposite thus furthermore going on to suggest a binary oppositional stance to what is usually emoted although with similar levels of disdain towards a set situation. Where fear and terror is usually prominent, the content of Joya&apos;s political direct to camera video is of a fearful and political nature but focusing more on an elevating sense of equality rather than threats and execution. It&apos;s an engaging piece, providing an engaging account of a very brave person.",

Hockney just comes across as an Andy Warhol wannabe--the artificial yellow hair, the I am an artist&quot; eccentric eyeglasses. The flat one-note swimming pool paintings derived from commercial art styles and techniques. Warhol did stylized art of Marylin, Liz Taylor and Elvis--but he did a lot of other things in his art as well. Warhol&apos;s &apos;factory&apos; was open to other creative people. A whole community grew out of his activities. Hockney&apos;s world seems like a soap opera of people in a self-indulgent little coterie/clique. Yes there is a swimming pool scene of nude young men with camera angles looking up their butts, and a glamorized but documentary-style shot of two guys having sex. Maybe that was &apos;cutting edge&apos; for film in the 1970s--but now--who cares? And Warhol&apos;s many films about gays and transvestites that same period in New York were a lot more honest, and a lot more weird, and curiously, had a lot more vitality.\n\nSo--Hockney is not a very interesting or appealing person on film--just annoying, or out of his depth maybe. And the world has moved way past the gay &quot;statement&quot; films of 50 years ago.",

Crespi manages to perform a successful operation, but during the recuperation, he gives a drug to Ross that gives him the appearance of death. When Ross is pronounced &quot;dead&quot;, Dr. Thomas (a staff member at Crespi&apos;s hospital) suspects Crespi of killing Ross, but Crespi overwhelms Thomas, and locks him in a closet while Crespi attends the funeral and burial, with Ross still alive. Not sure of what Crespi did, Thomas and colleague Dr. Arnold dig up Ross&apos; body for an autopsy, but when Ross &quot;comes back from the dead&quot;, what will happen next? Intriguing film based on Poe&apos;s &quot;Premature Burial&quot; with a very sly, mad performance by Von Stroheim and very well done subdued performances by the rest of the cast. The film was shot in the Bronx, so production values are not the peak of excellence, but even the direction could have been better with many close-ups and shots of the actors that are a few seconds too long. A score to the film would have helped, and the romantic subplots w/ the doctors &amp; nurses (2 of them) detract from the main story, but the story is enough to help this B movie. Rating, 6.",

The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don&apos;t care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint.\n\nConclusion.\n\nA fun B-movie and a must for all horror fans. Though it does nothing to forward the genre.",

At least the musical numbers in DS are actually worth sitting through.\n\nThe reasons it scores so highly are:\n\n1) The mirror sequence. The finest comic sequence ever committed to film. Sure, it&apos;s old-hat vaudeville, but it&apos;s professional, beautifully timed and spirals into wonderful absurdity.\n\n2) The one-liners, puns and other jokes. Pick of the crop are the peanut stall interchange, the telephone sequence, the riddles (&apos;what has four pairs of pants, lives in Philadelphia, and it never rains but it pours?&apos;) and the final battle (especially the stock footage of monkeys and elephants running to save the army under siege - the kind of thing the Zucker Bros pinched for their comedies). Oh, yes, and the motorcycle routines.\n\n3) The satire on politics and warmongering. The Brothers simply deflate the pomposity of the whole deal.\n\n4) The fact that Zeppo is actually given something to do.\n\nAnybody who thinks the Farrelly brothers are the last word in comedy should be strapped to a chair and shown Marx Bros films over and over again, until they concede.",

      "reviewBody": "I must admit, I was very surprised by this film. When you see the previews for P.S. it looks as if it is nothing more than a simple romantic comedy of sorts that hints more towards originality than refurbished Hollywood. While there are elements of humor and greatness in this film, the preview can be a bit dissecting. This is a tragedy of sorts. It is the story of a woman still searching for her true self and cannot do that because of tragedy that has constantly fallen upon her during her life. It reminds me of It&apos;s A Wonderful Life when George Bailey finally realizes that perhaps he isn&apos;t needed anymore in town and decides to end his life. This is where our story somewhat begins with Louise (Laura Linney). While it isn&apos;t as dramatic as Jimmy Stewart on a bridge, Linney does give off this aura of depression and pensiveness. Where is her life, why does she continue with this repetitive routine at work, and what is her relationship with others around her are simple questions that become much larger as the film progresses.\n\nWhat really captured me with this film was the utterly beautiful chemistry between Topher Grace and Laura Linney. They really embraced this sense of adventure, comfortability, and fear of the unknown exceptionally well. From the moment that they shared screen time together until the rather poignant ending, I thought that the two of them made an award-winning pair. Topher is growing up quickly in Hollywood and this film should prove that he has the &quot;chops&quot; to play with the bigger boys. The same can be said for Linney that continues to prove that she can make movies that redefine the roles of both women in film and involved in film. While I think that her role in this film should have garnered her with an Oscar nomination over the over-hyped lackluster Kinsey. I am still honored to see her getting the praise that she deserves. Her emotions are so raw and real that you can literally get lost in her words and actions while forgetting that you are actually watching a film. I would be hard pressed to be able to name another actress that could do that with the material that she does.\n\nThe rest of the cast in this film supported our two characters with the greatest of ease. This film is the perfect example of small parts making a huge impact on a film. Gabriel Byrne is outstanding in a role that could have been very one-dimensional. He brings depth and almost a bit of &quot;evil&quot; to his character that he only helps give Linney that extra push into her climactic ending. The same can be said for Paul Rudd and Marcia Gay Harden whom may seem miscast or at least oddly cast in this film, but both prove with the greatest of ease why they continue to work in Hollywood. It was the strength of the cast that really brought this character study out of the ultimate fate of several others of the same nature. The characters/actors brought this story to life and gave it this unglazed vision of the real world where people struggle with past histories and long for the opportunity to see what life would be like if only one thing would have been different.\n\nThis leads me into my favorite part of the story which was the subtle themes and story that was happening behind the characters/actors. There was more than just one element happening to our characters which helped give so much depth to the story and people. It wasn&apos;t just Louise looking for love, but also the chance of a &quot;what if&quot; encounter that normally would never happen in your average person&apos;s life. I loved all the elements from Byrne&apos;s secret, to Harden&apos;s indiscretions, to Rudd&apos;s dual life that really built a strong point for this story. I felt as if these characters were real and that the elements that were facing them were not built by Hollywood, but instead crafted by the truth of another. That is what made this story work. There wasn&apos;t this all-powerful run to the airport at the end, but instead a somber moment that made you reflect back on the rest of the film, dreaming of another chance to watch.\n\nOverall, I really liked this movie. I felt that director Dylan Kidd did a very wonderful and bold job with this film proving that he can handle everything from simple themes to multi-layered moments that will reign supreme in your mind. Linney and Grace&apos;s chemistry was outstanding. I watched this film with the words, &quot;I didn&apos;t think it would go this far&quot; dripping from my mouth. It was different than the previews and overall better. I suggest it to all and hope that you will be able to see the vivid reality that Kidd has painted with his film, P.S.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****",

      "reviewBody": "Hitchcock bragged that The Birds was pure fantasy, with no connection to real life (as we know it).  I&apos;ve seen this movie a few times and I still wonder what it &quot;means,&quot; if it has a specific meaning.  It might just be a horror film about preternatural killer birds, but I humbly suggest that it might, in a sense, be an allegory about the Nuclear Paranoia of the era. Not an exact allegory like &quot;Pilgrim&apos;s Progress,&quot; but perhaps a parable, or a fable if you like, with the birds standing in for all those forces ready to kill innocent people for no good reason.  &quot;The Birds&quot; is so richly suggestive that there&apos;s an Oedipal theme as well, and some hints that Mitch isn&apos;t a very admirable guy, and so on... very Kubrickian, but predating &quot;2001&quot; by 4 or 5 years.  It&apos;s a film that can simply entertain, or frighten, or hold one&apos;s interest, without begging for interpretation.  But it&apos;s fun to wonder what the writer and director were thinking, and how much the actors/actresses knew of the artistic intent of the filmmakers.  It&apos;s interesting too that after &quot;Psycho,&quot; with its classic musical score, Hitchcock made &quot;The Birds&quot; a 2-hour film with no music - except the squawks, clucks and cries of The Birds.  Wonderful picture.",

And if you have seen &quot;Scrubs&quot;, then you have essentially already seen &quot;White Coats&quot; as well. Yes, it was the exact same formula used for both projects.\n\nThe acting in the movie was good, and that did help the movie along quite nicely. And it was a good change of pace to see a cast of mostly new faces. And it should be said that the various actors and actresses did good jobs with their given roles and characters. And there was no doubt about it being Dan Aykroyd, Dave Foley and Matt Frewer who were the pulling names to make you sit down and watch the movie, despite them not having overly big roles in the movie.\n\nIt should also be said that there were some good laughs throughout the course of the movie.\n\nIf you enjoy comedy movies, then by all means do sit down to watch &quot;White Coats&quot;, if you have the chance. Just bear in mind that it is not a movie that will leave a lasting impression.",

      "reviewBody": "To me, and presumably a number of others, there was something special about Robotech. For all it&apos;s many convolutions it was lightning in a bottle. The energy, the complex sci-fi packaged in a youth demo-graph, the richly drawn characters struggling against real darkness and danger, the music and everything else. There has been a lot of similar anime that has fallen far short, not least the turgid, corporate &apos;Shadow Chronicles&apos;. So the fact that lily C.A.T. was brought to us by the same people that constructed Robotech potentially promised something special, or at least something in that familiar style. Pleasingly, the animation is pretty much the same, and several familiar voice actors crop up, but ultimately the question would be whether it stacks up on it&apos;s own. \n\nThe story is disappointingly derivative, in equal part to &apos;Alien&apos; and &apos;The Thing&apos;. There are a few interesting ideas, mainly concerning suspended animation over long periods in deep space travel, and time and effort has gone into the ship design and the future technology, but it is essentially nothing new. The story concerns a deep space expedition that travels to a distant planet to investigate the possibility of habitation but along the way is contaminated with some form of alien life which eventually starts picking the passengers and crew off one by one. Add to this an A.I. that has it&apos;s own agenda and two passengers that are not who they claim to be and we are ready to go down a pretty familiar path. Telling an old tale is always forgivable if it is done inventively and with energy and I would say, in this regard, that lily C.A.T. gets a pass mark. It is more problematic, I feel, in it&apos;s indecision over whether it is more for adults or for kids. There is some horror and some of the concepts are quite adult yet it fails at creating an adult internal reality. Mostly in regards to the characters reactions to some pretty horrific events. It might well work for more adventurous younger viewers but it is hard for me to say. The characters are mostly interesting and well realized but their interaction falls way short of the mark for adult sensibilities which is generally not the case with Macross, Mospeada and Southern Cross, or Robotech. \n\nI refer to these other anime mainly because it would be hard to recommend Lily C.A.T. on it&apos;s own. A fan of the aforementioned franchises would have a much better chance with this than a random viewer. This, like Robotech is storytelling on the cusp between adolescence and the adult, and that would be a problem for some, who had no prior fondness for the work of Carl Macek and his ilk. Ultimately, for lovers of Robotech I would recommend Lily C.A.T. as worth the effort. It may not be a masterpiece but it definitely has that same mood and feel. It has that sense of energy and fun for the most part and it&apos;s flaws are there, but it can still be enjoyed if you are in the mood to be generous with it.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1995, the movie &quot;le hussard sur le toit&quot; was released and it had a record; it was the most expensive movie ever made. This record was beaten seven years later with this film. But once again, this enormous budget was worth to be spending. Alain Chabat controls perfectly the huge incomes to his disposition (for example, sceneries are carefully restored and the crowd movements are wide) and he succeeds in recreating the fanciful atmosphere of the Astérix&apos;albums. His making is very inventive, full of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves. Moreover, he doesn&apos;t only emphasize on the special effects of the movie and this was one of the faults of the first Astérix&apos; film made by Claude Zidi in 1999. On the other hand, what a casting! It&apos;s very similar to the Sacha Guitry&apos;s film &quot;si Versailles m&apos;étais conté&quot; and you can have fun by guessing which actor epitomize which character of the album &quot;Astérix et Cléopâtre&quot;. As far as Christian Clavier and Gérard Depardieu are concerned, they&apos;re better managed than in the Zidi&apos;s film: they don&apos;t ham it up and are more credible in their respective roles even if Depardieu isn&apos;t fat enough. The other actors are excellent, (especially Gérard Darmon) rightly chosen even the minor actors in whom Chabat grants a big importance. Nevertheless, this one doesn&apos;t fit in the Caesar&apos;s role: he is a bit listless and not authoritarian enough. At last, let&apos;s notice that the characters&apos; names are successful and funny puns (Menubestofplus, Numérobis, Itinéris), but they&apos;re only easily understood for French people. At the end, a successful adaptation of the Astérix&apos;s comic strip on the screen and a pleasant entertainment."

      "reviewBody": "Many years ago there was a film starring Alec Guinness called &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, which took the case that a member of a wealthy family murders off his relatives to inherit the estate. &quot;Le Couperet&quot; offers a similar plot, although this time a disgruntled unemployed engineer becomes an inept assassin to remove his competitors for a top job with often-hilarious consequences.\n\nIn this very dark comedy Jose Garcia does well as the bumbling killer, at times reminiscent of a young Jack Lemmon, and there are many surprises along the way. The film does highlight more sincerely than you may expect the plight of middle-aged professionals that are retrenched, and find it difficult to obtain positions in the current climate. Many watching the movie might well relate to its characters and their plight.\n\nExcellent sequences include the job interview, which has more than a ring of truth, the discussions about unemployment and its social consequences by the discouraged out-of-work executives, and the scenes with the marriage counselor. Despite its black humour, there is a very human side to this film. Costa-Gavras is an exceptional filmmaker, with experience that shows in the smooth integration of the hilarious with an undertow of real pathos. The story ends on a suitably enigmatic note.",

It is re-watchable, if for no other reason than to see if the script holds up to analysis. Generally I tend to avoid films with a lot of flashbacks, but in this case, the three points of view presented are intriguing. Acting and character development are acceptable. The film has strong violence and some perverted sexual situations, but hey, this is not supposed to be family entertainment. It is what it is, and what it is, is different. I found it to be entertaining because the unique presentation held interest. Give &quot;Surveillence&quot; a try if you are looking for something beyond the obvious. - MERK",

It&apos;s pure porn, naturally, but also a hard-to-obtain milestone with a cult history like no other movie could ever present. &quot;Deep Throat&quot; made the porn-industry what it is today: a mainstream and very profitable business in which actors and directors get respect and sympathy. And, instead of simply editing a whole lot of boring hardcore sequences together, the makers of this film wanted to tell a story (although a very silly one) with a great sense of humor! Linda Lovelace stars as a poor young woman who can&apos;t enjoy physical love no matter what she tries Along with her doctor (the utterly cool Harry Reems) she discovers that her clitoris is wrongfully placed at the back-end of her throat! The doctor, as well as multiple other volunteers, gladly teaches her a way by which she can enjoy sex after all. This premise alone already is quite comical but humorist value of &quot;Deep Throat&quot; is increased by the playful performances (Reems is having the time of his life), the brilliant music (wait until you hear the title song!) and the implementation of typical but non-pornographic footage that illustrates what kind of pleasure the characters are going through (for example, shots from a rocket-launch when the men are climaxing). Funny stuffand Lovelace still looks better than most female porn stars today!",

      "reviewBody": "Very solid and straightforward entry into the Spaghetti Western genre. Lacks some of the off kilter atmosphere and inventive action of a stylish Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci picture, but, despite this, still manages to entertain with decent story, characters, a good villain, and dingy locations. Notably co-written by Italian film stalwarts Bruno Corbucci and Fernando Di Leo, and directed by the well-rounded Domenico Paollela.\n\nScruffy, good-natured, and free spirited Miguel just wants to go to New York and be an artist, and makes his money by dealing with a one-legged, underworld figure named Coyote. Cooper is an older family man, ashamed of being an outlaw, storing his loot so he can move his wife daughter away from the life he has fallen into, and he has the misfortune of having a cutthroat partner named Moxon. Cooper and Miguel cross paths when Cooper and Moxon rob the bank in which Miguel has been keeping his New York money. After slaughtering the bank tellers, Moxon tries to double cross Cooper during their escape, only to be thrown off the wagon and down the rocky mountainside. Miguel stops Cooper, only wanting his NY money, but unfortunately this polite exchange pins Miguel to Cooper as his accomplice, and the two are captured.  Miguel is cleared and set free, promising Cooper that he will look in on his wife and daughter. Cooper on the other hand is sentenced to life with hard labor, stuck chest deep in a filthy marsh and interrogated as to the whereabouts of his loot. Moxon, bloodied and mean, gathers himself from the hillside and goes back to his gang of thugs.\n\nIt is after this setup that the film kicks into gear, with the surviving Moxon stealing back the loot and taking Cooper&apos;s daughter and wife, Cooper contracting a fatal case of malaria and escaping from jail, and Miguel having to eke out a living again (he doesn&apos;t get his NY money back) and deal with Moxon&apos;s gang, who is going after Coyote and his associates. So, in typical fashion, paths cross again, and the revenge fueled Cooper and feisty Miguel go after the cold-hearted Moxon and his gang, battling it out in the usual dilapidated locales of most Spaghetti Westerns. Its a good&apos; film, by a capable director, with defined characters, maybe a little sparse or bland in the action department, cinematography/settings were good, as well as the music (although could do without the bouncy , annoying `La Cucaracha&apos; melody in one repeated theme). A nice film all around. Well worth a look. 7/10.",

Two are brother (Garrel) and sister (Green) identical twins (or so we&apos;re told) who have an almost metaphysical bond and the third is an interloper (Pitt) who falls in lust with the sister. There&apos;s little plot to this slice of young adult life flick which seems to be more of a Bertolucci pet project than a commercial product for the masses. Less than engaging and much less than compelling, &quot;The Dreamers&quot; immerses itself in the esoterics of the place and time to the exclusion of anyone who wasn&apos;t there then. Beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted with some young actors doing superb work under difficult circumstances with plenty of graphic nudity and sex, &quot;The Dreamers&quot; will play best with aficionados of French cinema, Bertolucci fans, etc. Those who are squeamish about sex/nudity should pass. All others, be prepared for a marginally interesting watch. (B)",

Maybe I was over-prepared (Hey, it took me a second viewing of &apos;Citizen Kane&apos; to get my past pre-set expectations!). But while I could see why M*A*S*H was groundbreaking and important for a Hollywood film of it&apos;s day (lack of the usual clear narrative line, anti-war stance, overlapping, improvised dialogue, sexuality, bloody operating room scenes serving as ironic counterpart, etc), it felt pretty dated and unfocused. There are some very funny moments, but a lot of the ironies seem easy, and there&apos;s a lack of a true darker underpinnings and ideas, unlike, say, &apos;Dr. Strangelove&apos;. \n\nA lot of the humor is juvenile, cruel and silly. And while I get that&apos;s the point – nothing can be more deeply juvenile, cruel and silly than war, it got repetitive and heavy handed after a while. The performances are good, but beyond Robert Duvall, none of the characters have much in the way of dimensions. People stay exactly what we think they are from the moment we meet them. \n\nWalter Chow makes a good argument on the web site &apos;Film Freak Central&apos;, that the sexism, homophobia, etc are the whole point. Altman is saying we&apos;re ALL beasts at heart, even if we act like we&apos;re bucking the system. It&apos;s an interesting idea, but I&apos;m not sure I buy it&apos;s what Altman was intending.",

I loved the soundtrack( some songs just stuck in my head) I believe this movie showed in humorous way what needs to be changed and what is definitely wrong in the society. And that they used some clichés. Well it&apos;s not the end of the world.\n\nLiving in the country were homosexuals have equal rights it&apos;s odd to see that there are countries where they are subjected to abuse and beating. But I do believe that this movie shows hope that this will change. Everybody deserves his/hers happiness and it&apos;s wrong to define person according to his sexual orientation. This was the main aim of the movie If even one person changed his opinion after watching this movie it served it purpose."

      "reviewBody": "A lavish anime production that did it mean a new record for the most expensive Japanese animated movie . This is one of the smartest, most overwhelming animations ever . The yarn takes place in an alternative universe , where some modern inventions where never discovered or made available for the advancement of our societies. In the middle of the 19th century, in the midst of the Industrial Revolution, the young inventor Ray, raised in a family of scientists, awaits the return of his father and grandfather to America where they continue their research. However, the only news that Ray receives about them is a mysterious metal ball sent by his grandfather. From the moment that comes into his hands, Ray finds himself involved in a world of incredible intrigues , being relentlessly pursued by the the nefarious O&apos;Hara Foundation . As the steam-engine inventor Lloyd Steam and his son Edward discover a pure mineral water source . The axis of the film is a strange ball , in fact, it&apos;s an extraordinary ball of steam, the secret key to an incomparable force that various powerful organizations are eager to capture. Ray must discover which of these organizations represents good and which represents evil. Then an experiment goes wrong and a ball-like machine appears from the destruction.\n\nJapanese animation set in 1860s Britain, directed by Katsuhiro Ôtomo one of the masters of the genre , author of the science fiction classic ¨Akira¨. It is a literary playground for non-stop action , nail-biting chases , spectacle , drama , escapism and scientific exploration . But most of all it is fun This movie Steamboy is an excellent Anime, made in the purest catastrophic and futuristic style by the master Otomo with animated scenes in a clear line , containing great spectacularity and a story that combines the past and future common mastery. An interesting an engaging plot about a teen calle Ray who has to choose sides when his father and his grandfather at odds over the progress and meaning of science, Ray must try to determine for himself what he believes in and whom he can trust, as the future lies in his young hands. As the boy inventor finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly conflict over a revolutionary advance in steam power. There&apos;re also historical characters as Robert Stephenson who was the son of George Stephenson, known as the Father of the Railway , in 1829, they built a locomotive &quot;Rocket&quot; in the Rainhill Trials and won and Robert built lots of steam locomotives in England. ¨Steamboy&quot; is definitely a perfect example of Steampunk fiction sub-genre , as it takes a historical setting : Industrial Revolution, and adding the element of Sci-fi super science and whose main representation was ¨April and the Extraordinary World¨ by Christian Desmares, Franck Ekinci based on Jaques Tati&apos;s drawings , the latter creator of the imaginative stories of Adèle Blanc-Sec .\n\nLavishly financed by Production companies Production I. G. and Sunrise , being efficiently directed by master animator Katsuhiro Ôtomo (Akira, Memories ,Mushishi , World Apartment Horror, Spriggan, Robot Carnival) who used one hundred ninety thousand individual drawings . It had a budget of 22 million dollars, being the most expensive Japanese animation production up to that time. Steamboy won the animation award at the Sitges Festival 2004 . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average . Well woorth seeing.",

We meet the attractive, blonde servant girl, Emily, who Stephen clearly has a lustful eye on from the get-go. By the next scene, he tries to kiss her coming down the stairs after bathing in his tub, and, well, she screams and he &quot;accidentally&quot; strangles her. With his brother assisting him, they put her body in a big sack and sink her in the river, then follows the cover-up of the murder.\n\nWell, this film is quite interesting, dark and suspenseful - there&apos;s a lot going on here. The print I saw looked strikingly full of sharp black and white contrast. The photography in this makes the film menacing with blackened rooms lit only by candle light casting dark, sharp shadows across the walls, some extreme camera angles up stairs and down halls, shots of faces seen only in mirrors, extreme close-ups, and sweat dripping on the face of a nervous murderer.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a lesser-known effort than the same director&apos;s notoriously awful ROBOT MONSTER (1953) but it actually proves somewhat better, if still in no way a good film. It may well be the first zombie picture to receive a sci-fi slant (thus predating George A. Romero&apos;s regrettably landmark NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by 8 years!}), but the monsters&apos; use here is really no different than the various &apos;alien takeover&apos; ploys we had seen and would continue to see until that particular fad burnt itself out! What is different is that the zombies were rendered so in a car crash, so that the victims are all scarred, bloody and literally torn to pieces (one of them keeps losing an arm throughout)!; their real form, then, is nothing more than a glowing speck which enters the human body through the brain.\n\nThe titular site, of course, is the U.S. rocket-launching base and the aliens are here to sabotage their every effort to breach outer space...which they do by shooting an unwieldy bazooka straight at the shuttle (at one point, the man does it while one-armed and hits the bull&apos;s-eye regardless – so much for his partner&apos;s whining that he should restore his other limb, of course by finding another human donor)! By the way, one of the film&apos;s main founts of amusement is the aliens&apos; evident contempt for one another! – incidentally, they occasionally report to their intergalactic superior, who appears on their monitor in the form of a floating pancake!! \n\nAt the base, we have the usual motley crew of military brass, rookie scientists and the obligatory German expert, who comes with a geeky-but-cute niece who throws the Doc into a fit by flirting with the young man on his time! The two lovers have to cut loose in order to enjoy some quality time together, meeting with another couple to have themselves a picnic-by-moonlight; however, the hero is too immersed in his work not to notice the static on his pal&apos;s radio, which means that a transmitter is being illegally operated in the vicinity (and which, he reasons, may have something to do with the rockets going haywire)! While he and his girl go snooping around, the other two are abducted by the aliens to their cave hide-out and placed half-dangling into what appears to be a sink while the girl is undressed to then be wrapped in a plastic sheet (in preparation for her being transmitted into space), while the boy&apos;s body makes for a plastic surgeon&apos;s dream as the bruised-up alien pilfers whatever takes his fancy from him – assuming that, if he looks good, he should be less conspicuous when roaming outside! \n\nHero and heroine are soon in the aliens&apos; clutches themselves, but he manages to escape simply by passing his watch in front of the controls: I have to wonder, at this stage, what would have happened had the leading man not been Physics-savvy! He lands in the home of a hillbilly (who appears before long toting a gun in his pyjamas) and calls the authorities – again, since he is who he is, we do not get the usual wasting-of-time with the hero attempting to make the cops believe his story! Even so, the pace of the 68-minute film is rather slow, being even stopped dead in its tracks at the climax so as to allow most of the cast (including the eminent scientist, who is actually present in some group-shots but not others!) – captured by the aliens by means of a paralyzing gun! – to methodically work out, via mathematical equations, what would cause an explosion from the materials at their disposal inside the cave! \n\nAgain, the film is nothing to write home about and yet it does contrive a circular twist ending which was totally unexpected and downright cynical for such a low-brow offering! For the record, this viewing came by way of an old and quite hazy TV transmission that is continually interrupted for ad-breaks (though these were somewhat haphazardly eliminated afterwards).",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was once broadcast on German TV - at a very late hour - and since one of my favourite actresses, Lilli Palmer, appears in it I decided to tape it. I&apos;m so glad I did! Overall it&apos;s a pretty silly film, the story is certainly no masterpiece but I really enjoyed all the typical 1960&apos;s views. The buildings, the cars, the card system that picks Olga and Anja as the perfect couple to deal with the problem. The slapstick comedy group looks as if they&apos;re somewhere dragged in, but this is a minor case of Europudding so who cares. A funny film in my view, perhaps not in the way the makers meant it to be, but I had fun watching it albeit over thirty years after production. That probably helped too. Seven points out of ten, but... that&apos;s my personal opinion!",

      "reviewBody": "With the title &quot;Buck and the Magic Bracelet&quot;, I was expecting something directly aimed at kids. If that was their intention then it must have been made for kids with really long attention spans.\n\nThe film opens up introducing us to a group of gold prospectors. They evidently have a decent claim and they let a shady character know about it. The guy attempts to sell information about the fortune to a group of outlaws but they kill him after hearing where the gold stash is being hidden. The gang rushes into the camp and easily guns down most of the people at the camp. The leader of the group of gold miners and his son are two of our protagonists. The father is shot twice and left face down in a river. His teenage son is shot once and for some inexplicable reason (oh yeah...he&apos;s our hero so he CAN&apos;T die) isn&apos;t finished off.\n\nThe teen is discovered by Matt McCoy and his goofy Native American pseudo-medicine man sidekick. They nurse the boy back to health and try to both find his father and the outlaw gang responsible for slaughtering a lot of people. I hope you like a lot of talking and a lot of snow because you get both in spades here. People talk around campfires, ride around on horses in the snow, lay in bed talking, walk around in the snow, sit around a table talking, ride around some more in the snow...yawn...excuse me.\n\nTo break up the monotony, there is a sloppily edited dogfight in the middle of the movie. Parts of it look like they are playing and other parts look like they are really fighting. The cuts are so choppy, though, it&apos;s difficult to know exactly what they are doing. The film just limps along from there.\n\nThis Italian production with the assistance of PM Entertainment (collective groan) doesn&apos;t seem very sure of what it wants to be. A large chunk of it is actually along the lines of a Western. However, they throw that silly Native American into the story and give him the titular magic bracelet which he sort of gives to the boy as a gift. They also give us a strange gang leader by making her clutch a Bible and constantly spout out Biblical references.\n\nI imagine this film had a tight budget but a couple of the sets look like some high school students built them on a stage and allowed the film makers to use them. It was like watching a filmed play rather than a motion picture. Acting is difficult to assess since a lot of it appears to have been dubbed in a studio after filming was completed. No matter though. A cast full of classically trained actors couldn&apos;t have saved this one. 1/10",

This film was an major box office disappointment back in the summer of 1991. This film has become an cult classic. Rourke and Johnson gives amusing performances.\n\nDVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD only extra is the original theatrical trailer. This Post-Futuristic action film is fun and a treat for fans of the two leads. Written by Don Michael Paul, who wrote the equally trashy action-thriller &quot;Half Past Dead&quot;. (****/*****).",

Scenes shot around the city (in particular the newly developed Bay area) are displayed along with the music of the incredibly talented John Cale as performed by Wales big stars (Catatonia, Big Leaves, Manic Street Preachers). If you know Cardiff at all then this is the film to watch as it shows the city without over glamourising it but still portraying it&apos;s beauty. Added to this is commentary in the beautiful Welsh language...my only question is when will they release the soundtrack and video?",

Joy! Ok, so I watched this movie, and it&apos;s honestly not that bad! Yes, it&apos;s a bit cheesy in a 1970s sort of way, and there are a few pauses when people are speaking, and there are lines like &quot;This is where the fish live&quot;, but this movie is really not that awful! Watching a film like &quot;Manos&quot; or &quot;Red Zone Cuba&quot; without the MST3K treatment would make a person long for the sweet release of death, but I think I could have watched this film without the riffing and still have enjoyed it. I thought it was a decent movie. True, it had plotholes big enough to drive a barfed-on Charger through, but it was a pretty decent movie. And I have a HUGE crush on the main character, Melissa. Touched by Satan or not, she&apos;s a sweetie who only wanted to help her sister. :("

      "reviewBody": "Dzien Swira ( Day of the freak) is Koterski&apos;s latest addition to an already impressive portfolio. Like his other semi-autobiographical move titled Nic Smiesznego ( nothing funny), Dzien Swira records the inner dialogue &amp; the prose of a single day in the life of Adam Miauczynski, a character based on M. Koterski. Miauczynski, like Koterski, is an compulsive-obsessive, excentric, bitter &amp; disillusioned individual caught in Poland&apos;s post communist reality, a reality as Ill suited to him as the communist one was. One of the reasons why Koterski&apos;s work is either loved or intensly disliked by Poles, is the painfully acurate description of polish hell, made all the more vivid by his insistance on showing the trivial &amp; at the same time essential moments of daily life in excruciating detail. life is all the more hell when the damned are aware that life could be different, and this is what makes Miauczynski&apos;s suffering all the more real.  A number of the scenes are classics, unequalled by any of Koterski&apos;s contemporaries, especially the  scenes depicting Miauczynski&apos;s relationship with his son, the senate, train toilet and street demonstration scenes.\n\nIt is unfortuante for the western viewer that the context &amp; language of the film make it very difficult to translate adequatly, refering as it does to polish classical literature, contemporary culture and nigh-untranslatable street slang, the contrast being all the more vivid, since Miauczynski is a Polish literature lecturer obsessed with what he percieves to be the decay of the language he loves.\n\nIf I were to compare Koterski to any western director, it would be to Britain&apos;s  Mike Leigh. An insane Mike leigh with an infectious sense of humour &amp; a penchant for social commentary.\n\nAll in all, This is Koterski&apos;s finest work to date, perhaps the finest Polish film in the last 5 years. My rating is a solid 8/10"

While fans will always compare Carpenter&apos;s later movies with his early genre classics, &quot;Vampires&quot; is excellent entertainment, even if it isn&apos;t an &quot;important&quot; or &quot;milestone&quot; horror event.\n\nJames Woods is not the most likable of heroes here but he&apos;s very watchable. Daniel Baldwin delivers a believable performance as his dependable sidekick. &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&apos; Sheryl Lee plays the leggy small-town hooker who is unfortunately bit by a Master Vampire, Valek. There are also appearances from Maximilian Schell and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;&apos;s Gregory Sierra.\n\nIn Carpenter&apos;s &quot;Vampires&quot;, the undead don&apos;t exit this world peacefully. Instead, they explode like giant Catherine wheels. This is exciting to watch - you can&apos;t have enough sparking vampires, can you? With lots of action and a few dark laughs, you could do a lot worse than see this movie.\n\nWith an excellent score, great visuals and a fast pace, &quot;Vampires&quot; scores a strong 8 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The Republic is threatened as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) agitates for a rebellion. Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) arrives at Coruscant to vote on the creation of the Army of the Republic. After an assassination attempt, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Padmé. They haven&apos;t seen each other in 10 years. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) traces the attacks to bounty hunter Jango Fett and the hidden water planet Kamino.\n\nThis dialog is horribly flat. It&apos;s not simply the stilted awkward romance. The expositions are all done in tired uninteresting way. There is a lot of walking-and-talking and sitting in a circle. It is all terrible and I would suggest fast-forwarding several sections of the movie.\n\nOn the other hand, the CGI continues to be great. The best is Kamino. That world is sci-fi heaven. I love the aliens. I love Jango Fett and Anakin is nowhere to be found. McGregor gets to leave behind that dead weight. I also like the Blade-Runner-like lower levels of Coruscant although that bar should have been a lot seedier. It has too much of a sports bar feel. The coliseum is good and who doesn&apos;t love that outfit on Portman. There is plenty of fun action in this movie but it needs a better writer to punch up the dialog.",

      "reviewBody": "Cat&apos;s Play is about two elderly sisters (really more one than the other), one of whom lives in the city and the other lives in the country. They keep in contact through letters and occasional phone calls. They were famous beauties in their youth, but now they are lonely and unappreciated by those around them. One of them goes through a crisis while the other tries to help her from a distance. The most striking thing about this movie is its unusual structure. Much of the soundtrack is excerpts from the letters which are often read aloud by both of the sisters at once. Also, brief glimpses of their past continually flash into view. This can make for disconcerting viewing at first but once you get used to it it serves the story well.",

Especially at the time when homosexuality was blatantly illegal in Germany. Not surprisingly, the film was soon banned and almost completely destroyed.\n\nConrad Veidt was also bold for starring in it, even if he had not yet been made into a star for &quot;Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; the following year. This was at least Veidt&apos;s second time working with Oswald, having just finished up &quot;Uncanny Stories&quot;.\n\nThe plot is interesting in making the presentation that homosexuality is normal (definitely a minority view at the time) and the real crime was extortion from those who would blackmail closeted men. Although neither Oswald nor Veidt were gay, they clearly had sympathy for their brethren (Veidt was later better known for standing up for the Jewish community).",

      "reviewBody": "I recently received a present of the Ralph Bakshi animated film &quot;FIRE &amp; ICE&quot; and was shocked to see the documentary &quot;Painting With Fire&quot; included on Disc-2 (well done Blue Underground).\n\nI quickly slipped the disc into the player and pressed &quot;play&quot;...\n\nRight, I&apos;m a Frank Frazetta enthusiast and so I was thinking there&apos;s NO way they&apos;ll do a good documentary on this fabled artist. Wrong! They did a good job indeed.\n\nThe feature-length documentary covers Frazetta&apos;s early life and fills in the missing blanks about what he did in the years when he had to fend for himself. For an artist who is extremely private and reclusive, this film peeled back the layers of mystery and revealed the man beneath. It&apos;s a very intimate portrait and one that throws light on many aspects of his life as a sportsman and a devoted family man.\n\nThe film opens with an absolutely stunning 3-D rendering of the Clayburn Moore &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; statue and the painting literally comes to life and moves. The facial bones twitch and the eyes of the Barbarian blaze with intense fire, the sword drips with blood and the slave girl grips onto his leg with unbridled lust conveyed in her luscious legs and flowing hair and across the sky huge vultures circle for the meat on the pile of corpses that the Barbarian stands knee deep in. Skulls lie crushed all around and the sun drips golden fire all over the landscape behind this mighty warrior.\n\nWhat a truly inspirational opening to the film.\n\nI adored the method used to illustrate and showcase the oil paintings. The colours were rich and the lighting was magnificent. It was like seeing the artworks for the first time. It&apos;s one thing seeing them in books and another thing to see them displayed on the screen in such vivid detail. And, what a lovely surprise it was to see rare sketches and variant versions of some of Frazetta&apos;s paintings in this film.\n\nDirector Lance Laspina&apos;s method of using &quot;chapters&quot; to sketch though Frazetta&apos;s life reminded me of a book-style presentation and it worked splendidly. This was a very effective format and allowed the viewer to focus in on the different aspects of Frazetta&apos;s varied life.\n\nIt was great to see Frazetta talk and reminisce about the old days. And despite his ill-health this man is still a fighter! And I noticed that in MANY of the paintings it is Frazetta himself who is the central figure for the model. Just take a careful look at &quot;Conan the Adventurer&quot; (the Clayburn statue) and you&apos;ll realize it&apos;s none other than Frazetta himself! The lighting in the film really brought out subtle details that are missing in the books. The art had much greater shading and revealed acres of stuff that the books can never get close to due to their &quot;flat&quot; printing process and the quality of paper used.\n\nIt was interesting to note that because Frazetta had such a busy life as a sportsman, he sometimes ran out of time for his commissions and was thus reduced to painting the pieces in a matter of hours. If he had run out of paper he would simply tear out a plank of wood from the floorboard and use that as a canvas. He would make a pot of coffee, put on a classical record and finish the painting in six hours or so. He&apos;d then spend a week recovering from this intense battle between his creative juices and his physical body. His hands would literally shake with the exertion after painting these pieces. The impulse and speed of the work actually lent his finished pieces a rawness and savagery that is sorely lacking in the works of other painters such as Boris Vallejo.\n\nThe film also discussed the influence that Frazetta has had on the world of movies, literature and art. John Milius, Simon Bisley, Ralph Bakshi, Joe Jusko, Sylvester Stallone, George Lucas, Bernie Wrightson, Clint Eastwood, Michael Kaluta, Steven Spielberg, etc, have all been influenced by Frazetta.\n\nAnd to compare Frazetta to Michelangelo and Da Vinci was valid. Frazetta is sometimes ignored by the Fine Art community because he is often regarded as an &quot;illustrator&quot;. Well, in that case, so were all the past greats because they also illustrated books e.g. The Holy Bible. I think there is idle snobbery levelled at Frazetta because his subject matter usually depicts Fantasy scenes. Nevertheless, Frazetta does not need to prove himself to the Art critics because this man can paint with oils, water-colours, ink, he has produced prints and worked on canvas and also delivered stunning sculptures. A man of many talents then! Just like his fellow painters from the Renaissance period.\n\nIt was monumental to see how, after several strokes that left his right arm almost paralyzed, Frazetta taught himself to paint and draw with his left hand. What a great example he is to all of us.\n\nI would have preferred this film to have run for six hours but I can&apos;t complain too much since they did cover many of the bases. Even the end credits proved to be fun. Laspina left a little clip after the film closed for the fans - we see Ralph Bakshi walking away from the Frazetta museum with a huge stolen canvas stuck under his shirt! All I now need to do is see the Special Edition of this documentary which contains a second disc of supplemental material where we see Frazetta drawing a panther and the picture gallery contained on the DVD is supposed to be brilliant.\n\nBlue Underground should be congratulated for producing such a lovingly created package.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

I liked it very much, have seen it twice, once on the big screen and just now on DVD. It was not the least bit boring the second time even though the film relies heavily on its plot twists and the suspense they produce. I think many people just don&apos;t come to terms with cross-overs, they want either a suspense film that takes itself dead serious or a clear cut comedy. I liked the humor in the film and its outrageous characters well played by a perfectly assembled cast. Patricia Arquette is just great, a pleasure to watch! She deserves the price for the funniest sociopath femme fatale ever seen on the silver screen. Vincent Gallo in his tiny role as contract killer is the icing on the cake! The film is superbly shot and directed and features a brilliant soundtrack. I voted it a 9.",

Undoubtedly there are many other best Korean films of this but do not know how to explain it ... but this film as I say I like too, want to really charming atmosphere, both for the pathos that is able to convey, either for the rich characters and very often not devoid of morality and that are unexpected in their way of acting and of course for many other reasons. The plot is very smooth and is full of surprises, especially at the end that according to the tradition of Korean cinema does not disappoint the expectations of the viewer. I&apos;m sorry to see many this film is not so much appreciated and it is unfortunate, and not to defend the film but I find it unfairly underestimate. It is not a perfect agreement, but I consider it a good movie survivor movie very addictive, fast-paced and full of facets",

Just watched Funès &apos;Oscar&apos; last night and was laughing with tears.

      "reviewBody": "A film fully deserving to be in IMDb&apos;s top 250, Jim Sheridan&apos;s &quot;In The Name of the Father&quot; is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.\n\nThe story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.\n\nThe two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.\n\nJim Sheridan&apos;s direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons&apos; freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.\n\nOf course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.\n\n&quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.",

If you are looking for an &quot;entertaining&quot; film, then go elsewhere. Dubus, author of the short story that the film &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; was based, is not out to entertain. He is into dealing with real people in situations that are catastrophic to one&apos;s life. John Curran, the director, peels away at the emotions of these 4 characters who share loveless relationships with their respective mates, with the exception of one of them. There is no flash, no melodrama, and no special effects (thank God). It is also beautifully filmed in the Vancouver, B.C. area, and the acting is top notch, especially the performance of Laura Dern. It&apos;s like watching an episode of Thirtysomething without all the smaltz and cutesiness. Highly recommended!!",

Andie Anderson covers the &quot;How To&quot; beat for &quot;Composure&quot; magazine and is assigned to write an article on &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.&quot; They are sure to meet each other in a bar and both tries to get what they want without knowing what they are really doing.\n\nThis is one of the funnier romantic comedies, if you&apos;d like some laughs. There are many laugh-out-loud moments here and there. The humor was witty and slapstick, which I love in comedies.\n\nThe chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey is great. this film is like the battle of the sexes.\n\nDon&apos;t watch this film if you want lies between romance but if you would like to have a really good time, then this is the film.",

      "reviewBody": "Talented stuntman/fighter Dan Chupong (Born To Fight) is given little to work with in this repetitive, overlong mess from Thailand. Clearly hoping to bask in the financial glory of Ong Bak and The Protector (aka Tom Yum Goong), this film seems rushed and it shows. The plot is terrible and the acting is substandard (even for a Thai film). The action scenes are poorly conceived and filmed. Slow motion is used for shots that don&apos;t deserve it and money shots almost always feature a cutaway revealing the choreographer&apos;s complete inability to make the action scenes work. If they get any credit, it&apos;s that they don&apos;t stoop even lower and use the horrible &quot;shaky, camera on a string&quot; crap to further cover the shortcomings! The character&apos;s are cardboard and the set&apos;s look like, well, sets! The special effects are cheap (as in most modern Thai films).\n\nJust a reminder to those Thai filmmakers who wish to emulate Ong Bak-\n\n1. Get talented martial artists &amp; stuntmen \n\n2. Concentrate on the quality of the fight scenes and don&apos;t give in to CGI and cutaways. \n\n3. Keep the plot simple (the best martial arts films usually have minimal plot)\n\nIf you are going to ask those talented stuntmen to risk injury or death, at least try to make a film worth them getting injured for!",

Leslie Nielson is a great guy I&apos;m so sorry about his performance in Scarymovie 3 and those movies that squashed the good and funny memories movies like these gave us fans. Priscila Presley is Gorgeous...she looks fine...but this movie dates back to 1992..so i guess now a days she must look very old..I guess. Anyhow the film was great and i remember good as yesterday the time this film came out, it came out a week before The Terminator 2 and Leslie Nielsen used to do this television spots saying: Hasta la vista..baby...they were so damn funny..I hope someone remembers them...Or someone gets them for a DVD. its a definite 10 out of 10 on Comedy."

      "reviewBody": "I have fond memories of this film. It played in Boston in 1979--back then I was a closeted high school kid. It played for over a year at a theatre in Boston and I was curious to see why. I somehow got in (the film was R rated and I looked about 14) and loved it! It was funny, uplifting, gay positive and made me realize there is nothing wrong with being gay. Seeing it again over 20 years later it&apos;s not as funny or uplifting as it once was but I still enjoyed it.\n\nThe plot is old hat and the movie is directed by the numbers but the script has some very funny lines and all the performances are great. Particularly funny are Michel Serrault (as the more feminine gay man) and Michel Galabru (as the minister of moral order). The final dinner party sequence is absolutely hysterical! \n\nSome people have said this film has stereotyped gay characters and that Serrault&apos;s constant screaming is annoying. I disagree--I found nothing offensive about the characters (there are gay men like Serrault--I&apos;ve met them!) and his screaming is actually pretty funny. A very good French farce--well worth seeing. Ignore the R rating--it only has that because of the subject matter (which was pretty risky for 1978). If it were rerated today it would easily get a PG-13.\n\nSkip the two sequels and the Americanized remake &quot;The Birdcage&quot; in which they use the exact same script as the original--with all the same jokes and some bad new ones added in.",

      "reviewBody": "Returning home for Christmas, a true-crime podcaster looking forward to seeing their family during the holidays is alarmed when a series of crimes against fellow members of the trans community paint her as a prime suspect and must rely on her skillset and other friends to stop the rampage.\n\nThere&apos;s quite a lot to enjoy here with this one. Among the better elements with this one is the solid small-town murder mystery that serves as the main setup of the whole feature. The central plotline involving the group of friends coming together at the behest of their returning friend trying to set everything right during the holiday season which serves to set off a series of killings around the town that are directly tied to her arrival makes everything appear quite enjoyable overall. The small-town history involving a history of murders taking place in the town that includes a series of unraveling clues pointing to a figure from it&apos;s past come back to life and starting a new spree over everything is all handled nicely enough as the clues lead to a killer directly targeting members of the specific community. Even with this factor being taken into account, the whole setup coming into a rather cohesive conclusion adds nicely to the overall presentation which is a great time here. This one also manages to bring together a fairly solid series of brutal and generally enjoyable stalker set pieces that are handled rather nicely. The opening setup that turns out to be a recreation of one of the stories from the podcast she hosts is an impressive enough time as the case reveal comes off nicely after the stalking and brutal murder that starts everything. The regular stalking here, done at the hands of the Santa-dressed killer, are generally quite fun, resulting in either the sudden shock ambush that ends in a brutal kill or the grim aftermath of everything when they stumble upon everything. With there being a lot to like about it, the only real issue with this one is the generally predictable setup that results from operating in such familiar territory where so much of this one is hammered home by the slasher formula. It&apos;s not truly detrimental or damaging but does stand out as a factor against this one.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

The film is a sequence of events during wartime and it just carries on after the film has ended, just like it was already in existence once the film had started. It does have dramatic segments, eg, the home visit granted to Gustav Diessl (Karl), the exploits involving Hans-Joachim Mobis (the student) and various battlefield situations, confrontations and realizations.\n\nThe film occasionally has slow segments but it is interesting from a social history perspective.

In that and every other respect, this film is flawed only by the long and eventually tedious chase scene involving the fake Keystone Kops. I admit it is enjoyable to watch people run in fast motion (typical of silent films), but that scene gets boring before long. I am a big Abbott and Costello fan. Here, the acting is good. Fred Clark is good as Joseph Gorman, and the man who plays the producer (I don&apos;t remember his name) was billed last, and he is one of the best actors in the cast, better than Fred Clark, even! Also, Roscoe Ates (the hillbilly who stutters) was perfect! The mistaken identity scene of the two policemen and crooks is hilarious. This film also has many other hilarious touches: Costello being thrown out of the theater (twice), the train scenes, the stop-motion when Joseph Gorman (disguised as Sergei), yells Cut!, Abbott and Costello being carried by each other at various times, and many more. This is not the best A&amp;C film (only one film is reserved for that honor), but this is not a bad\n\nfilm. It doesn&apos;t need to be better, really. It all depends on your expectations (and that should never be very high anyway).",

      "reviewBody": "It is a very touching story of a Tamil Migrant Murughan (Mammothy) coming to makes a living in a small Kerala town by ironing clothes on the road side. He has three children, one son and two girls from whom one is blind.\n\nThe movie is about his struggles to live an honest life and be a role model of goodness to his children.\n\nHe lives in a slum where he meets a neighbor lady (Actress Padma Priya) who also begs and does odd road side jobs. She takes care of his children.\n\nMurughan goes to iron clothes at the house of a rich lady (Actress Meena) who is ailing and is about to die.\n\nBoth of them bond with each other because of the blind-girl as their link. Meena feels for the struggle of a single father raising three kids on his own in this cruel city.\n\nShe wants to donate her eyes to the blind girl when she dies but her husband is against it and does not like her special emotional bond with ironing man Mammoothy. It is a bond of PURE TRUE AGAPE LOVE. When they see each other in the eyes they know there is a special connection between two human beings\n\nThere are so many moments in the movie that will make us cry - not because it shows the tragic lives of poor - but because it shows how resilient they are to show kindness, love, compassion and humanity even in trying times of struggle.\n\nBEAUTIFUL movie - I cried many times during the movie.\n\nThe direction by Director Kamal is fabulous. To come out with such story idea and weave a movie around it is brilliant\n\nMeena dies but her family is not able to fulfill her wish to donated her eyes to the young blind girl.\n\nIn the end Mommothy goes back to the village after that along with his 3 kids and that Padma Priya.\n\nDirector Kamal is famous for making social based family dramas in Malayalam cinema. The setting and feel of the movie including the dress and make-up and looks are so real. All the characters are well crafted and everyone have acted so well.\n\nThe music by Mohan Sitara is very good and songs are beautiful.\n\nThe movie won The National award for the Best Family Movie for 2006, and several state and filmfare awards. Mammoothy, Padma Priya and the blind girl too won awards for best acting.\n\nA wholesome humane drama that everyone should watch.\n\nI would go with 7.6 out of 10 for this gem.",

      "reviewBody": "Who knew the end of the world could be such a bummer? In &quot;2012,&quot; the first and certainly not the last big-studio bid to cash in on the supposed coming apocalypse, Roland Emmerich once again lays waste to Earth and its assorted famous landmarks, but this time it&apos;s with a touch of exhaustion, an almost routine finality. Maybe it&apos;s middle age (it&apos;s his first apocalypse since he turned 50). Or, maybe, it&apos;s because to a consummate destroyer of worlds (four doomsdays and counting), the true end of days is really just the final dreary step. Few images, after all, beat that of the California coast crumbling into the ocean like a sinking aircraft carrier, or of the subsequent barrage of flaming volcanic rock that pummels the earth when Yellowstone finally goes kaput, blowing its literal top and the audience&apos;s already torpid movie-going mind. \n\nBoth of those sequences are given high prominence in &quot;2012,&quot; though neither is predicted by the end of the Mesoamerican long-count calendar, from which this movie takes its name if not much else. Weaving escapist fantasy into scientific fact has long been the prerogative of high-concept vehicles like &quot;2012,&quot; which omit most of the finer factual details (the Mayans never actually wrote of the end of the world, for starters) to make their own pseudoscientific conceits appear frighteningly plausible. That may explain why &quot;2012&quot; takes a nominally more scientific approach to the cataclysm (neutrinos, crust displacement, blah, blah, blah), though even Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the president&apos;s scientific adviser, seems to know that it&apos;s all one big joke long before Woody Harrelson, as some sort of apocalyptic hippie fanatic, can pop his eyeballs and declare, &quot;It&apos;s the apocalypse, man!&quot;\n\nMr. Harrelson&apos;s character doesn&apos;t figure much into the story beyond the usual wise fool archetype, though at least his bug-eyed mugging gives oomph to what is otherwise a pretty unremarkable disaster flick. The real selling point of &quot;2012&quot; is, of course, the annihilation of our planet and most of our species, and, if nothing else, the destruction here can hardly be called boring. That&apos;s to be expected, seeing that Mr. Emmerich is certainly an old hand in the industry, having already vaporized, trampled, flooded and frozen the planet solid, not to mention raked in a collective ten-figure sum at the domestic box office. Considering the worldwide scale of &quot;2012&quot; and Mr. Emmerich&apos;s incurable tendency to one-up himself, it&apos;s also no surprise that here he works so relentlessly to cover all his catastrophic bases, from the pulverization of the Vatican to the inundation of D.C., to the purely extraneous sight of a cruise ship keeling over, Paul Gallico-style, upending the galley and its many digitally- rendered flailing human bodies.\n\nBut, seriously, what&apos;s the point anymore? Like most apocalyptic trifles, &quot;2012&quot; trades on the doomsday scenario to stake the usual forgettable claims at the resilience of the human spirit (and the American nuclear family) but mostly it just wants to watch the world burn, sometimes literally. The human race is ending, after all, and if that end never really resonates in &quot;2012,&quot; it&apos;s because not even Mr. Emmerich seems interested in examining it beyond the visceral level. Although he duly taps his emotional well by occasionally bringing you close to the calamity – the tiny human bodies tumbling from a collapsing freeway are certainly frightening – it&apos;s hard to feel awed by or even care at all about any of it when all the man wants to do (and wants us to do) is have a good time. \n\n&quot;2012&quot; is a pretty much a romp, then, and, for its first ruinous hour at least, a reasonably satisfying one. The sturdy B-movie screenplay by Mr. Emmerich and Harold Kloser actually picks up in 2009, giving time to introduce a few of the leading men and women who will figure into the imminent end, some of them likable (Mr. Ejiofor), others abhorrent (Oliver Platt as a blustering government bigwig), most of them just plain boring. Three years later, as the cracks in the Earth and the story become wider and more worrisome, more people come into play, in this case an everyfamily (John Cusack, Amanda Peet and their two burdensome children) we&apos;re meant to follow while modern civilization crumbles around them, in increasingly spectacular ways. \n\nBut the spectacle wears off and the movie soon drags, done in when Mr. Emmerich&apos;s exuberant flair for devastation gives way to his seriously underwhelming affinity for family soap operatics and teary moments of worldwide harmony. Part of the problem with movies like &quot;2012&quot; is that even with the latest brand of pricey computer-generated effects at their disposal, such wizardry tends to undercut itself when you stop and realize that almost none of what you&apos;re seeing is really there, really happening. Mr. Emmerich is not entirely to blame, of course, though it&apos;s nonetheless a wonder that after three stabs at destroying the planet, he still can&apos;t avoid the disconnect between human tragedy and worldwide destruction that runs through &quot;2012&quot; like a fissure and keeps even its most realistic-looking disasters from ever feeling remotely real. Which may make it the perfect tonic to this particular ploy of the paranoia market.",

A movie that probably appealed to the crowd of the Quartier Latin. The story of a techno society. A society where people are killed if they act in an illogical way (ex. express sentiments). The episode of the pool is particularly good. The movie goes between two paradox: technology and poetry. But eventually, victory will prevail in the form of a «je vous aime».\n\nGreat lines in this one: «Dans la vie, il n&apos;y a que le présent. Personne n&apos;a vécu dans le passé et personne ne vivra dans le futur». Or this question by Alpha 60: «Quel est le privilège des morts?». Lemmy answers: «Ne plus mourir». This is just great!\n\nOn last word: Eddie Constantine and Anna Karina are both terrific in their role.\n\nOut of 100, I give it 79. That&apos;s good for *** out of ****.\n\nSeen at home, in Toronto, on November 12th, 2002.",

Maybe a bit too long for the story, but that&apos;s ok.\n\nThe young Valentina Cortese is elegant and charming. There is even a moment of &quot;meta&quot; where the American soldier, taking her out from the party to the garden, talks about how there are such scenes in almost every American movie, and she responds accordingly after coming close to losing control.\n\nPost-war Italian perception of the USA comes with some great trivia in the movie. Such as that statement from General Clarke which she teaches her students:\n\n&quot;We will not ask anything from Italy other than a little bit of land to bury our dead&quot;\n\nWhat I have difficulty wrapping my head around is how fast Italian cinema could react to the very new situation of Americans being there in the country, becoming a drive for certain aspects of social life, interacting with local women.\n\nThis movie itself is proof that screenplays were not passing from hand to hand for years in an effort to make them as mature as they can. Writers just observed what&apos;s going on, hit fast their typewriters, and not much time was spent between that creative phase and hands-on production.\n\nThat&apos;s why these movies look &quot;imperfect&quot; from today&apos;s understanding of cinema, whereas their foremost quality is indeed that freshness.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie was done in a style that was quite unique from your standard issue shoot &apos;em up or Scorsese gangster movie in a number of ways I found refreshing. It slowed down the pace of dialogue scenes to a relatable and believable level, made the violence far more realistic, and didn&apos;t overdo the music. Those who can&apos;t handle too much, or too realistic of violence won&apos;t like this movie.\n\nSome might feel the dialogue makes the movie drag just a bit, but if you like realistic filmmaking, they&apos;ve made it feel as if you&apos;re sitting in on actual conversations. The scenes and cuts are long but are livened up with the fairly constant scummy-ness of the characters. James Gandolfini seemed to prattle on a little too much but I suppose that was the point.\n\nThe violence can be summed up as unsentimental; much of it can be defined by the difficult achievement of not falling into played out Hollywood clichés. There are no heros in this movie as the director doesn&apos;t use cheap tricks, like voiceovers, disproportionate screen time, or happy music to convince you that one criminal is worth rooting for over the others. There is no glorification or demonization of violence, as it is depicted without the influence of music, and the audience can decide for themselves about what is being shown. There are no Schwartzenegger-style shoot outs, as the violence is usually sudden but brutal and loud. Every gunshot is closer to being as loud as real life, so you get a little jolt with every shot like being at a gun range.\n\nThe use of music is also played down and important in making both the violence and dialogue distinct. There is some music which gives the movie some energy, but overall far less than the average Hollywood film. This adds an element of suspense as the music doesn&apos;t give away what is about to happen in every scene (like a movie with ominous music when something bad is about to happen, etc.). The lack of music also allows the audience a semblance of neutrality in what they are observing; characters are allowed to be likable without being good. \n\nThis is the sort of movie you could expect if the hero was removed and you only had the villains and thugs left over--it is far less boring.",

Even the actors, acting and not actually fighting for their lives, look like they&apos;ve been through hell. The filming holds back nothing on the horror of being caught in a storm on the infamous North Face of the Eiger, in the Alps. These very talented, likable chaps (even though Germans just before WWII, yes), are up against it big time. And the movie makes the most of it.\n\nIt&apos;s a simple story, and a simple structure, contrasting the comfortable press corps down below with their fireplaces and wine, against the men on the cliff, night and day. A woman and a love story are a part of it as we go, but this is more a love/hate story of men against each other, against themselves, and against the mountain, weather systems included. \n\nIt&apos;s a relief to see a movie without heroes. There is a lot of heroism, for sure, and admirable human behavior up and down. But none of the throbbing music as one or the other of the men performs an impossible feat. This is about a real life and death confrontation, and breakdown, and impossibility. Well done, well done. High frustrating and nerve wracking to watch, but well done.",

      "reviewBody": "You don&apos;t get me containing my excitement too much for Hong Kong/Japanese/Korean action films.  I see a name like John Woo, Chow Yun-Fat or Takeshi Kitano on a movie poster and I break into hives with anticipation.  What makes these foreign films better or more appealing than their American counterparts you ask?  Well, first and foremost is the style. Our friends from the East have a knack for action sequences.  Check out the gunplay in films like Hard Boiled and Shiri and see their influences in the West with films like Face/Off and Heat.  \n\nSo when the creators of Shiri reunited for a film about a cop on the trail of a madman who has taken over a speeding train, my heart began to pump uncontrollably and pestered my local DVD supplier continually for updates as to the film&apos;s North American Release.  \n\nThe film I am referring is Tube.  Directed by first timer Baek Woon-Hak and starring a multitude of hyphenated names that you wouldn&apos;t recognize, the movie was about a former assassin for the government that takes over a subway train to persuade his former boss and now mortal enemy to sacrifice his life for the lives of the innocents on board.\n\nPutting a crink in the plans is a rogue cop who has been on the killers trail for many years, and who too is looking for payback for the death of his wife and the loss of a finger in an abbreviated altercation that took place some time in the past.  \n\nAs demands are made and peaceful solutions examined, people are shot, ambushes are ordered and rail cars are blown up.  Everything we would expect from a film of this genre.  \n\nIt&apos;s too bad it doesn&apos;t work.\n\nWhile watching Tube I wondered if the Director and Producers were sitting around one weekend watching American action films and tried to copy what they thought were the best parts from each.  The premise is stripped from Under Siege 2 (and if you ever copy a Steven Segal film, you need your head checked), the opening sequence rips of Heat, an attempted rescue on the train was done better in Speed and even films like Apollo 13 and Stallone&apos;s Daylight look to have had their scenes stolen directly from the original screenplays.\n\nBut stealing from big budget films wasn&apos;t the only once noticeable Americanization of the film.  Speeches are given when the characters should be acting or reacting to their situations and flashbacks are thrown in to stretch the running time.  The soundtrack was overwhelming as is Hans Zimmer was vacationing in Tokyo and had nothing better to do than provide a repeating beat that would bound out of my subwoofer every time we see the train speeding down the track.  Even the comic relief in the character of a thug that is handcuffed in one of the rail cars was straight from a Bruckheimer brainstorm.  Whoa&apos;s me!\n\nMy excitement over the films release was quashed like a lake being thrown on a campfire.  Everything that made these foreign films unique and pulse pounding was lost to what I can only assume was an attempt to puncture a hole in the lucrative North American video market.  I could have cared less about the characters, I felt no attachment to the emotional attachment between the various couples and if you are just going to throw mindless action at me, well then, I hate to say it but give me a Michael Bay film. At least then I know what to expect and don&apos;t feel robbed of an afternoon.\n\nwww.gregsrants.com",

Til Schweiger plays Ludo Dekker a libertine who is condemned to make 600 hours of social work in a children&apos;s home. There works Anna (Nora Tschirner). In their childhood Dekker was terrible to Anna. So far the starting constellation. But it&apos;s a comedy with happy ending. The beauty of such films is to observe the slight variations from one story to another and how the extravagant figures come along and end up together to make the perfect match. I understand that it&apos;s a very special kind of humor that doesn&apos;t suite everybody. Nevertheless I liked this big city story very much. Funy slapstick situations, nice dialogs, sweet plot, wonderful characters, good acting, and splendid Berlin as a fantastic supporting actor.",
