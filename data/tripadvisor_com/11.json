A culinary experience featuring contemporary Pacific Northwest cuisine. Since serving our first meal in 2020, we’ve been delighted to be the place where locals and visitors of Seattle celebrate special occasions big and small – from first dates to anniversaries to family reunions. Our culinary team has dazzled guests with special prix-fixe menus that have become core to our locally-sourced and seasonal approach to Contemporary Pacific Northwest cuisine. We’re excited to announce that our dining room is exclusively offering a 3 or 4-Course Prix-Fixe menu as of March 15th, 2022. An extended Bar Menu will continue to be available to guests in our Bar and Lounge. We look forward to continuing to showcase the best of PNW cuisine and to the many special moments ahead!",

As this is not a typical music venue, our acoustic concert aboard a the Virginia V Steamship is incredibly unique. We also offer a very intimate listening environment that most traditional venues lack. This gives the musician an opportunity to connect with the audience and for the concert goers a very personal and meaningful experience.",

    "description": "This Seattle tour has it all: art, history, culture, and incredible views from the top of the iconic Space Needle!\n\nOur Seattle tour starts with a walk around the Queen Anne neighborhood and Seattle Center. As we pass by landmarks like the Museum of Pop Culture and Chihuly Garden and Glass, your local tour guide will point out the grounds’ lesser-known artworks and institutions, from the famous musical International Fountain to surrounding entertainment complexes like the Seattle Opera.\n\nFor any Seattle music fans, we can include a stop at a local radio station and record store to browse some vinyls and enjoy some local coffee. \n\nThen it’s off to the Space Needle for timed entry to the observation deck. Once there, you’ll enjoy a 360-degree Space Needle tour with your guide, who will point out other city landmarks and provide some Seattle history background.\n\nAfter the tour, continue enjoying spectacular views of the city, Puget Sound, and on clear days, the Olympics and Mount Rainier!",

His depth of knowledge about Seattle’s history and the stories of how the city was settled and built were both fascinating and engaging.\n\nSam’s storytelling was not only insightful but also sprinkled with humor, which made the tour even more enjoyable. He had a great way of bringing history to life and connecting it to the vibrant city Seattle is today.\n\nThe Space Needle itself was, of course, a highlight, but it was Sam’s guidance throughout the day that truly made the experience memorable. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Seattle—whether it’s your first time or you’re a local looking to rediscover the city!"

    "description": "The electric bikes make taking a three hour tour effortlessly. You will ease up the hills of Seattle while smiling. After the tour you will have seen many unique sites, expanded your knowledge of the waterways, the animals of the Sound and the neighborhoods, and you will have had an enjoyable and memorable experience that's truly all about Seattle. The electric bikes allow for close up viewing of the gardens, boat docks and other sites. Your guide is a local. I grew up in Seattle, taught in Seattle schools, I care about the city and the natural settings and continue to build my knowledge of Seattle. The helmets have an intercom system that helps us communicate while riding the bikes. Your safety is a priority, we stick mainly to bike paths and lightly traveled roads. Please check out the reviews on my website. Must be 16 to take the tour. The bikes are only designed for adults. I charge per bike. I do not charge for children riding on the back of the cargo bike.",

Joe was our tour guide and we could not have asked for a better tour guide.  Joe is incredibly kind, so knowledgable and it is clear he is passionate about the history of Seattle and delighted his guests.  He took us some epic spots we have never visited even after living here for 3 years!  You even get to play a game at the end of the ride and the prize for the winner is pretty epic too! :) Joe....  we will keep telling everyone we know who comes to visit to do this amazing experience! Thank you for a wonderful day out exploring this beautiful city!"

I have done 3 electric bike tours in my travels around the world and granted the last two weren't with native English speakers, but this by far was the best. I would absolutely recommend this tour for those who don't know the city and for those that do and don't get out much to see the great history of seattle.  They provide everything you need and they even do a wonderful job of explaining how to ride electric bikes for those who have not ridden one. Im a beginner mountain biker and sometimes see electric bikes as \"cheating\", but i feel like electric bikes are the best way to explore the city and allow yourself to take in the sights and views without being worn out. I would definitely do this tour again because there is so much to see and remember. They are patient, helpful, safe,  and most of all very kind. This tour is excellent for all age groups and people from all walks of life."

You’ll get to meet the locals, perhaps spot some flying fish, and pass by two renown attractions: the notorious Gum Wall and the original Starbucks!\n\nYou’ll also get to enjoy local eats from hearty fish stew to fresh local cheeses and fruits. We’ll combine these local foods with cuisine inspired by immigrants who have brought their own style, ingredients, and stories to Seattle over the past century and a half.\n\nMaybe you’ll try a savory stuffed pastry, indulge in a cinnamon-coated cookie, or enjoy the perfect pairing of a locally roasted coffee and a decadent yogurt. While you eat, you’ll be even happier knowing you’re supporting the market with your ticket price!",

From November to June snowshoes/crampons will be provided when necessary since there is often snow on the trails in those months. \nWe hike a few miles throughout the day and you will experience diverse landscapes and scenery such as glaciers, mountains, waterfalls, rivers, lakes, and tall trees in old-growth forest which are all the highlights in Mount Rainier National Park.\n(In the winter areas of the park may be closed some days and not all highlights will be accessible at times).",

It was challenging because you would sink into the snow every so often . But so worth it. The views are spectacular and having lunch on a glacier is an incredible experience. We then hiked to a couple of waterfalls and a forest area so got to see all aspects of Mt Rainier. Susan was wonderful and very knowledgeable. Plenty of of bathroom facilities along the way so that was much appreciated."

I think ability definitely depends on the time of year.  This is a physically demanding tour when snow and ice are on the ground. I am a runner and would not recommend for anyone under 13 or over 65 (not in good physical health) during the snowy season.\n\nDefinitely an incredible tour, and Inwould definitely do again!"

The pick up time and location was right on and the ride out to the mountain was very comfy. After we put our snowshoes on and got our poles, Susan led us up the mountain. I was a little worried as I’d never snowshoed before but it went smoothly after getting the hang of it. \n\nThe views all around were spectacular! I recommend dressing in layers because you’ll be cold at first but you’ll want to shed your jacket about 5 minutes into the climb. \n\nAfter reaching the base again, we went to see Narada Falls (beautiful) and stopped at a number of other equally beautiful nature scenes. If you’re given the option of skipping anything, DON’T! See everything you can! You won’t regret it!"

The weather was perfect with clear blue skies making it perfect conditions for our trip.\n\nComfortable drive out to the park and pick up on time where designated.\n\nWe hiked a fair way up to a nice spot to have our picnic with all snow shoes and walking poles provided.  Various other stops after to see waterfalls, scenic spots, a running glacial river and an old growth forest.\n\nMy only suggestion would be the advert needs to be clearer regarding the strenuous nature of the snow hike and the suitability for some people.  We were probably the oldest in the group at mid 40s and fairly good fitness and we found it a little tough."

The views were spectacular in February with the snow and ice on the ground. Us two newbies found walking with crampons super easy. Susan is a wonderful guide with lots of cool ecological information (and nice snacks!)."

Susan was a great guide and pointed out lots of interesting things to see and learn about. A fun hike that does include some areas of incline and stairs, but not too challenging. Take a backpack to shed or add clothing layers if needed. Bottled water was provided. Bathrooms at the trailhead. Would recommend this to anyone who doesn’t want to commit to an all day event."
