      "reviewBody": "If you like slashers then you&apos;re most likely gonna enjoy you&apos;re next. This movie follows a fairly generic slasher plot and there&apos;s nothing necessarily different about it initially. The film does have scenes where viewers can get familiar with the characters but there&apos;s one in particular thats most prominent in the movie. The reason why, is slowly revealed as the film goes on and makes for an exciting buildup throughout. As far as content goes, I thought there was some entertaining and suspenseful sequences involving the characters trying to evade the home invaders. This movie does have a twist that is fairly easy to pick up on but it makes for a cool rewatch.\n\nSomething else I like about this film is how it&apos;s unique compared to other horror movies. In most other horror films I&apos;ve seen, the characters are usually easy targets for the antagonist because they all act stupid. However in this film the protagonist shows surprising signs of resourcefulness and even competence in fighting. This makes the movie fun because it&apos;s not just about her getting lucky but more so displays her skillsets. This left me wondering what shes gonna do next throughout the movie. I can&apos;t give this movie a perfect score because I thought the writing and acting could&apos;ve been way more convincing. I also wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the shaky camera shots as it just takes away from the overall experience. Either way I thought this was a solid slasher worth watching.",

How can this be though as the nun is supposedly a virgin and showed no signs of even being pregnant? Enter psychiatrist Jane Fonda who is sent to examine the highly mysterious and secretive Tilly. Fonda immediately locks horns with mother superior Anne Bancroft (Oscar-nominated) as Bancroft feels that the outside world has no right to disturb anyone in the convent. Fonda tries to help Tilly who appears to have a problem distinguishing between reality and fantasy. A really tense film that will keep you guessing until the very end. The screenplay is smart and Norman Jewison does another fine directing job here. The film is flawed in many areas and could even be considered very negative towards the Catholic Church, but it is still a production that is worth a look. 4 stars out of 5."

I had to look away sometimes because being a suspenseful movie watcher all my life I knew by the sound of the chilling music something was gonna happen that would freak me out and boy did it do its job.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t overly predictable. It was a look back on what exactly happened when Emily Rose got possessed and how it ended. It wasn&apos;t a &quot;push the catholic belief down everyones throat&quot; because defending the Priest was an agnostic lawyer trying to not only get ahead in her career but convince a journey that medical science could not determine she had a medical condition but a demonic possession. Cant tell you anymore than that.\n\nThe movie had a &quot;dark&quot; look and was cozy it kept me on the edge of my seat and the way she got possessed and how she looked was way freaky. Good movie and worth to own on DVD!",

      "reviewBody": "This film version of Jane Austin&apos;s Pride and Prejudice is generally pleasant to watch.  The cast is certainly glamorous and a slight change in the period moved the story into one with fancier costumes to look at.  At a few places the plot had to be rushed a little to make it fit into two hours and the ending is also a touch happier than in the novel.  Some critics lamented the slightly changed ending but this works actually very well for this medium. The rushed plot elements increase the overall pace but compromises somewhat the credibility of the characters, while the increased pace is at odds with the much more tranquil way of life in days gone by.\n\nTherefore, this is really watchable, but the definite version is the 1995 BBC mini series which is much closer to the novel as well.",

By this films style i mean a deeper meaning, and style maybe is not even the right word to explain what i mean. (Style) is probably the wrong word but anyway, the meaning behind that word that i am using is the innocence used in this film to triumph over the prejudice towards people who are not considered normal, in this case meaning Joon and Johnny depp&apos;s character in this film. Also the power to interest me and a story that keeps it&apos;s innocence. They really should make more films like Benny and Joon! To promote the equal judgment of all people. I am really happy i saw this wonderful film."

KARISHMA was speaking, crying, shouting, loving in same Exotic tone which was very common those days in Bollywood. Actresses were, mostly, used, not acted.\n\nAfter completion of 2/3rd of the movie, Shahrukh came and tries to be comic with his acts which he fails badly. Other than streching his arms and be romantic, other genres are above his talent.",

      "reviewBody": "The next film alphabetically on Disney Plus is &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad&quot; which is more interesting than truly successful. The Wartime effort left Disney short on resources and with many films and ideas too short to be cinematic releases, two of which were then glued together here and released as a feature. This is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen these two films, as opportunities to see if have been scarce - They&apos;ve almost never been on network TV and a VHS version didn&apos;t appear to be available when I was age appropriate.\n\nBasil Rathbone narrates an animated and abridged version of Kenneth Grahame&apos;s &quot;Wind in The Willows&quot; in which the rich and excitable Mr Toad loses his ancestral home to a pack of Weasels and must count on the guile of his friends to help him retrieve it. Then Bing Crosby introduces Washington Irvine&apos;s &quot;Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;. A schoolteacher moves to a New England town and falls for the town&apos;s most eligible maiden, but he has a rival for her affections, Brom, who comes up with an intriguing way to use a local legend to his advantage.\n\nThe animation for both stories is really good, as you might expect from this period of Disney. Crosby&apos;s narration is a little livelier than Rathbone&apos;s but he has more to do as the &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; half of the feature has very little other dialogue. I found that both stories struggled to hold my attention but of the two I enjoyed &quot;The Wind in The Willows&quot; a little more. Maybe it&apos;s just that I&apos;ve seen more adaptations of that one and was more familiar with the narrative, but it actually worked as a story - whereas the Sleepy Hollow aspect is a romantic slapstick comedy that just suddenly switches on a dime when it introduces its most famous character.\n\nIt&apos;s interesting from a completist standpoint but ultimately there&apos;s a reason that it hasn&apos;t been dragged back into the light, prior to its residence on Disney Plus - it&apos;s just not that entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the years, i have found few romantic comedies suited to my taste. Be it live action or in the form of anime, romantic comedies tend to be very mediocre IMO with only a handful that turn out really funny and enjoyable. Through some unforeseen circumstances i ended up not watching &quot;Gamer&quot; starring Gerald Butler and instead watched &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot;, also starring Gerald Butler. To be honest, it was my curiosity at seeing &quot;Mr &apos;This is Sparta&apos;&quot; handle a comedy lead role that convinced me to give this movie a shot.\n\nTHe premise is as such. Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a perfectionist, &quot;control freak&quot;-ish morning show TV producer whose show is on the verge of being canceled due to low ratings. One night, she comes home from a disastrous date and happens to watch a segment of a TV show, &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot;, hosted by &quot;shock jock&quot; by Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler). Abby calls into his show and argues with Mike on-air, in response to cynical attitude about relationships prompts, which leads to her quite literally &quot;hating his guts&quot;. The next day, she discovers that the station she works for has hired Mike to do a segment on her show in order to boost ratings. This kicks starts a very storm tossed relationship between the two which lends itself to numerous comedic turns. Sooner than expected, Abby just so happens to fall for her doctor neighbor and she grudgingly goes to Mike for advice at &quot;netting&quot; the man of her dreams(actually the only man who fulfilled her listed criteria). The unlikely pair cut a deal in that if she is She agrees to his advice and is successful, it would prove Mike&apos;s theories on relationships and she will work happily with him. However if Mike fails, he agrees to quit.\n\nAnyone with experience in this genre of movies can more or less fill in the rest of the story. Unlikely pair work together, more jokes, fall for each other, more jokes, Love triangle develops, tragedy strikes, touching finale. Finish.\n\nIn this case, I would admit that the usual formula actually works to a certain extent. It allows the audience the satisfaction of actually knowing what they are watching, and getting exactly what they are expecting. This is not avant Garde cinema, but it is entertainment. Also the formulaic story allows one to focus more on the scripting and acting, which IMO is where this movie truly shines.\n\nWitty banter and a cornucopia of innuendo-ed jokes fill up most of the film. Sexual references abound but are written in such a tactful way that they do not come off as crass or crude. Most sexual innuendo jokes tend to be rude and sometimes offensive; thankfully thats not the case here.There is wit to the humor in this movie that utilities word puns and double meanings in their jokes to good effect. Thankfully, the humor is not over-played and the more serious moments of the movie are spliced very well into the overall narrative. The characters and situations are written in such a way that anyone could easily identify with them, which lends to a greater emotional involvement in the film.\n\nStellar acting by the cast also helps. Special mention goes to Gerald Butler who proves to be an exceedingly versatile actor. He nails the carefree, in-your-face, yet internally bitter character of Mike Chadway to the point that it is easy to forget the actor playing the role and just become so involved with character himself. Katherine Heigl does a satisfying job as Abby, lending both her acting chops and eye candy to the complex lead role. \n\nMy only beef with this movie is that it could have expounded on the relationship themes a little more instead of falling back on &quot;the usual thing&quot;. Having a clearer conflict of ideals between Mike and Abby and maybe going deeper into the strengths and flaws of the ideas presented would have turned this film into a more thought provoking experience. &quot;what men really want&quot; , &quot;what women really look for&quot;, &quot;loving the &apos;me you want to see&apos; or loving &apos;the real me&apos;&quot;, all those little tidbits would have made benefited from a more central role in the film which would have given this movie a &quot;fresher&quot; feel instead of the stale standard story.\n\nI was personally very entertained by &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot; especially in the laughs department, not just because the jokes were extremely funny, but that they were also well written, witty and made sense without being offensive. I loved superb acting by the leads, excellent cast chemistry and an overall sense of escapism. \n\nAt the end of the day, All i can say is that unless you are already a fan of romantic comedies or unless you have an open mind when it comes to various movie genre(&lt;---like me), its best to stick with what you like. &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot; won&apos;t convert staunch action movie junkies or epic fantasy aficionados anytime soon, that&apos;s for sure, but just sit back relax and enjoy a good laugh that is easy on the brain. A hearty chuckle and a few quick tugs at the heartstrings now and then is good for body, mind and soul.\n\nNote to the &quot;not so proficient in English&quot; crowd: Keep your ears open for all the double meanings behind the jokes, its funnier that way.",

The English Language version is rather clumsily synchronized, although the voices used for the dubbing are fine. The on location filming is lovely. But what really makes it memorable, is the new musical score, composed by Anne and Milton Delugg. Not only are the songs charming, but the orchestrations are wonderful. This is basically the Grimm Brothers version of Cinderella, but the Fairy Godmother (from Perrault&apos;s tale) has been added. Goodtimes Home Video released a near mint videotape of it years ago, but it is now out of print (and it was never easy to find even when it was available). The only other release was a cassette from Republic home video(also out of print) which was missing 22 minutes, and was scratchy and splicey to boot. Ihope this film makes it to DVD soon!",

He can see the running bullet and slide his body left/right before it cross him. That means he got faster visual than the speed of a bullet !!! As he is faster than bullet, he is faster than any human being; that&apos;s why nobody (bad people) can harm him (if he doesn&apos;t let). So, he alone is enough to save everybody.\n\n... That was all about what is in the film. Actually, I like Ananta, I liked his last film &quot;Nisshartho Bhalobasha&quot;, I hoped this one will be better, but disappointed at last.\n\nAfter all, the starting of the story was good, Ananta&apos;s acting improved on the romantic side, his dance improved, his dialogs were enjoyable.\n\nI hope he will stop showing himself as a super-human.",

      "reviewBody": "The third Mad Mission movie - a very high paced slapstick parody of the James Bond and other spy movies with some Asian influences - is probably my favourite one of the entire series. Some silly toys of the first two movies have disappeared, the pace is much higher in this movie because of extremely interesting action scenes like on the Eiffel Tower and the jokes are even funnier than before and add a hilarious slapstick style to the movie for example when Samuel Hui plays Tic Tac Toe with cheats in a high secured area or when Carl Maka gets seduced and cheated in the most ridiculous way possible by his friend and a beautiful woman in a restaurant. A very special gem in this movie are the exotic locations for example in Paris and the appearances of some actors of the James Bond movies like Richard Kiel. Only the later Mission:Impossible star Peter Graves is awful and boring in this very entertaining flick filled with action and absurd humour. One can also see that the budget was higher than in the first two movies and most of the action scenes are really well executed.\n\nThe only negative point is that the quality of the special effects is very low. You can for example easily see strings when Samuel Hui uses his flight machine to escape after a robbery or when he is fighting in the submarine. You can also see that plastic models of ships or planes are used instead of real material. Another negative fact is that the dubbed versions are really awful.\n\nBut those details and this lack of professionalism doesn&apos;t change anything concerning the fact that this movie is still very entertaining over twenty-five years after its creation even if some effects, ideas and the story line are very old fashioned but at least in a charming and nostalgic way. I have seen this movie at least four times now and it is still entertaining and memorable in my opinion. So, if you are looking for a very funny and high paced parody of the James Bond and other spy movies with some charming characters, this movie is the perfect choice for you and it is also a good introduction to the whole Mad Mission universe in my opinion. That&apos;s why I can highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes action or comedy movies.",

There is a lot of drug references, though. The film&apos;s antagonist/loving father is Cloud Rock La Belle. A cycling enthusiast, who claims he&apos;s been stoned for the last 40 years and loving it. With a great score by Sufjan Stevens, this movie blew me away.\n\nAlmost painful to watch at times, because of Cloud Rock&apos;s brutal honesty, and unwillingness to adopt responsibility for the abandonment issues, that the filmmaker claims to have suffered. Brilliant movie-making.",

It&apos;s a very strong movie, and it&apos;s a damn fine thriller, too!! One of the other users mentioned &quot;Nattevagten/Nightwatch&quot;...but what, exactly, was new in that movie?? No, this movie is the one to see if you want Danish horror. True horror isn&apos;t about ax-wielding maniacs, true horror is taking the clue from everyday life, and then plant normal people in weird situations. Anyone who fails to see that, should stick with the teeny-bop movies and let the rest of us enjoy art!!",

The bluesy use of harmonica from the beginning reminds of the main theme in a french film noir classic, &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot; directed by Jacques Becker. The friendship between Cesar Romero and his crippled employee Victor Maddern is touching, the atmosphere in Romero&apos;s club is moody and sexy, the jukebox has some important apparitions (and like in &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; for a sequence, but we&apos;re far from that unique masterpiece). There are a lot of nice surprises in british film noir like this &quot;Street of shadows&quot;.",

PICKLE AND MR. PRYDE is the Holy Grail of Laurel films; it was lost for decades, then a French print turned up in somewhat unsatisfactory video versions. Now it has been beautifully restored with the original titles, which add a great deal of amusement to Laurel&apos;s portrayal of Pickle (a veddy, veddy British scientist). But it is his take on John Barrymore&apos;s Mr. Hyde that makes this film a must-have for any comedy buff: Laurel is not only hilarious, he is actually SCARY as he &apos;menaces&apos; the town while capering around with clawed hands outstretched...\n\nThis film is on an excellent new DVD of Laurel&apos;s work. I just wish they had also included MUD AND SAND...but this one is worth the price of the double disc set, all by itself.",

      "reviewBody": "The religious teenager Angie Albright (Sarah Thompson) moves to a small town to study Art History in college. She finds a weird roommate and befriends the student and former altar boy Rick (Matt Dallas). Angie decides to babysit to raise money to buy a bed and she finds an advertisement to work at the distant Stanton Farm in the countryside. She is welcomed by Jim Stanton (Bruce Thomas) and his wife Violet (Kristen Dalton) that are seeking a babysitter for their son Sam (Kai Caster) and they make arrangements for Friday night. Meanwhile Angie has the sensation that someone is stalking her and she goes to the police station and reports to Chief Dinneli (Bill Moseley). On Friday night, Angie&apos;s car breaks and Rick gives a ride to Angie to go to the farm. When she is alone with Sam, a stranger breaks in the farmhouse and Angie saves Sam from the man. Soon she learns that she is in the house of evil and nothing is like she thought it would be.\n\n&quot;Babysitter Wanted&quot; is a creepy and gore low budget horror movie surprisingly good. In the beginning, I thought that this movie would be a rip-off of &quot;When a Stranger Calls&quot; and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, but the story has a great and unexpected plot point to an original development. The direction is sharp and the cast has excellent performances and the boy is really creepy. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Procura-se Uma Babá&quot; (&quot;Babysitter Wanted&quot;)\n\nNote: On 15 April 2019 I saw this film again.",

      "reviewBody": "I have seen this film quite a few times and have always been somewhat puzzled about it. There was no doubt that it had some of the most emotive scenes of any war film but seemed fractured. At times there seemed to be far more realism in it&apos;s morality than other films which was understandable since Sam Fuller actually served with The Big Red One at this time so much of it is a first hand account of events and attitudes. I have now read some of the background to the making of the film,I think in the L.A. Times,which now makes sense of the flaws in the film. Apparently Sam Fuller&apos;s budget was cut to the minimum by the studios after a regime change and the original screenplay as shot was hacked to death by the same studio against Fuller&apos;s wishes. This was not the film he wanted to make but he made it. And it was not the film that he shot as is indicated by the very complete screenplay notes he made. I think it is Richard Schickel, the noted reviewer of Time magazine, who has laboured to find the missing outtakes and to put the film together in its complete form with over 40 minutes added to the length. Apparently this more complete cut significantly improves the film and adheres to Sam Fullers screenplay more accurately. This new cut is now playing to limited audiences and, hopefully, will be available on DVD. It must be emphasized that this is not the film that Fuller originally wanted to make as the budget was cut by 75%. Some of the comments made by other reviewers on these pages are valid as to authenticity specifically in battle scenes. But Fuller did not have the budget that both the Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan had. It will be interesting to see the new cut. Hopefully it will flesh out what could have been one of the greatest Second World War films.",

McIntire is killed, but Murphy takes him and they have one interesting journey back.\n\nThe film is kind of The Comancheros in reverse with a younger Texas Ranger bringing back an older outlaw. Like Stuart Whiteman with John Wayne, Sullivan is full of tricks and charm, but Murphy is up to it.\n\nThe whole film like The Comancheros depends on the chemistry between Murphy and Sullivan and they do it have it. It makes watching Seven Ways from Sundown good fun and you don&apos;t think about some glaring plot holes and some rather specious character motivation for the main and supporting characters. \n\nThe title comes from the fact Murphy&apos;s dad numbered rather than named his children. And Murphy&apos;s mom embellished the numbers with some additions, One for the money, Two for the show, etc. \n\nHey it could happen. I was in Fort Polk, Louisiana back in 1971 with a guy named John Twenty Five in basic training. Having seen this film in the theater way back when it was always on my mind during that rather grueling period of my life with Mr. Twenty Five.",

It&apos;s this attitude being celebrated here, an addendum to her Gleaners film which she liked making so much she took her camcorder and went back a couple of years later. \n\nTwo things worth gleaning here, both reflections of that attitude.\n\nOne is that the first film stirred so many people, she was flooded with letters of appreciation, handmade postcards and gifts of all kinds. There&apos;s quiet joy in being able to share in this outpour. Here too we see gleaning and gleaners of another kind, people touched so much by what they saw, they went out to fashion tokens by what they could find around them. Small gifts, but someone pored over them and made them with their hands, reflected in these we see Varda&apos;s own film, itself gathered up in the same loving spirit\n\nOne of these senders she visits, a smiling young couple in Nantes. The girl seems to have understood Varda&apos;s point behind the first film the best and Varda makes it a point to include this tidbit. It was about people getting by she says brightly, managing in spite of everything.\n\nThe other thing to glean is that she revisits many of the subjects she interviewed for the first one. Not the fact that she does but the way and how it gives rise to a way of seeing in a larger way. Some are better off, having found unexpected interest in them or a shelter from the cold, others had their share of trouble since. One professes to have given up alcohol (while stinking of wine says Varda), another seems perhaps pleased with the attention. But Varda is not there in any other way than as someone who knows them and wants to see how they are.\n\nThis is what Varda&apos;s aware presence bestows in turn. She is simply there to see, listen and nudge in a small way but no more. People are allowed to present themselves as they see fit. When she meets the black man who lives off a van cramped with garbage, she asks can you sleep here, he says he can with a smile, she asks do you have water, he does, she asks do you have anywhere to shower, he says there&apos;s a shower in the garage where he works, smiling. That&apos;s all.\n\nA view of hardship in other words, but seen through Varda&apos;s eyes, no one is victimized or pitied, no one allowed to be the center of self- pitying drama or merely the token of societal neglect. I say in other comments that Varda is a wise woman, a sage in her own right; not because she has a particularly intelligent or vehement answer to a question, but because she knows what questions are worth asking."

      "reviewBody": "You can&apos;t help but go into Wax Mask with a little trepidation. First time director, written by an aged Luci Fulci and Dario Argento (who also produced), both of whom have had a less than impressive careers as of late. That said, Wax Mask is not a disappointment. It isn&apos;t a great film, but an entertaining one.\n\nThe plot is liberally adapted from the classic Gaston Leroux story, also used for classic horror film House of Wax. A young girl sees her father killed by a metal handed maniac. Flash to 12? years later, she begins to work at a local wax museum that specializes in recreations of murders. We actually dont see much of the museum, just a few sculptures down one heavily draped hallway. A metal handed figure begins to go around town injecting and abducting prostitutes and children. All the while, the wax museum keeps a steady supply of figures that appear really lifelike. You know the story. A newspaper reporter begins to investigate the disappearances and takes a shine to the girl. Everything begins to point to the wax museum and its curator/mad inventor and his goons. The finale is ridiculous, but short enough to not ruin the film with its awkward turn.\n\nStivaletti handles the film pretty evenly. You can tell he learned a lot about atmosphere in his years working for Argento, Bava, and Soavi, but Stivaletti doesn&apos;t showcase any revelatory talent, just competent skill. Italian horror films are always style first, general substance in the plot or performances is always secondary to the mood and movement. The film is paced well, and doesn&apos;t pretend that we all won&apos;t know who the killer is, after all this is well tread territory.  The setting (early 1900&apos;s) and score are a welcome change, since Italian horror usually stays in modern times. Stivalletti makes use of heavy colours, POV, flashbacks, CGI, as well as old horror imagery like the gothic buildings, and a mad doctor laboratory with bubbling serums in tubes, and electrified levers. The lead actress is beautiful, sultry, wide eyed, and willing to take her top off. The hunky reporter is very lame and unappealing. He attempts to be suave, but he is just a dork. Miscasting him as the hero is the films real lowpoint. The curator is good, he doesn&apos;t overplay his part, not a drooling maniac, just threatening enough.\n\nItalian horror fans should find it a satisfactory film, nothing to astound you, but not overly disappointing, either. Other horror fans may be wary, but it does have a genuinely nice blend of old and new schools of horror. As far as Italian horror goes (where one must often not expect much in the acting and plotting department) it gets a B-. As far as standard horror it gets a C.",

      "reviewBody": "Forget the cheerful seasons greetings, as here&apos;s another nasty little holiday slasher that&apos;s only made more interesting for the fact it was directed by genre actor David A. Hess. However his presence might have been better suited in front of the camera than just behind it. &quot;To All A Good Night&quot; is another addition to the Christmas --- Santa Clause slasher cycle and probably one of the least known, despite coming out around the same time as &quot;You Better Watch Out&quot; and even before the likes of &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t Open till Christmas&quot;. Still with that on mind, it&apos;s your typically rancid and atmospherically moody slasher that amusingly passes the time but in the end there&apos;s not too much to write about. \n\nSticking to a formula that seems to be popular; it opens in the past showing a prank going horribly wrong then moves to the present time which has a group of horny rich girls at Calvin Finishing School for Girls waiting to secretly smuggle in their boyfriends for some late-night parting, but after doing so they start disappearing as someone in a Saint Nick costume is going around making ends meat of them. Does the past have something to do with it I can&apos;t see it any other way.\n\nIt had its moments (death by propeller was a neat touch), an unhinged, if wonky sounding electronic score and a cast (mostly no-names) that weren&apos;t too bad either. There&apos;s colourful bunch of characters (with expected red herrings; like Ralph the creepy looking gardener who can pop out from anywhere) and gladly they stood out from each other. The angelic Jennifer Runyon (in her debut performance --- although that&apos;s pretty for all the young cast) brings a grounded reality to her lead character. Her cute character was more sympathetic, thanks to her forlorn naïve innocence, but even so not worthless for that. Linda Gentile and Judith Bridges have titillating fun with their buxom parts. While Forrest Swanson and William Lauer are tolerable.\n\nThe location (a large sorority house) for such butchery is ominously remote, but David Hess&apos; glum direction was kind of clunky with many murky set-pieces with a real uneven focus on the deaths or a real lack of build up to them. Some happen off-screen, while others come off jarringly quick. Some passages are lethargic, like the long stretches of fooling around, bickering and then the waiting game for the killer to strike (oh there&apos;s numerous leg shots of our psychotic Santa killer walking stairs). The story kind of starts of plain (with some flat writing) but when it begins to open up to where its actually going, it brings out some rather amusing (though not all that intentional) and odd developments. Plenty of contrived instances make there way in and there&apos;s one scene that paints it perfectly. After discovering a dead body one of the characters run to the phone to call the police, but *drum roll* the phone is dead. But just before picking it up the killer perfectly times it by cutting the phone line just before it reaches his ear. But in the end it&apos;s the sudden revelation well more so the outrageous second one that&apos;s a groaner.\n\nA so-so seasonal low-budget slasher.",

But it must also be said that this is a very amusing film (and that is what counts), very well designed and with beautiful dresses; and all this in excellent Agfacolor. There is witty dialogue, it is well paced (though the military parades seem to go on for hours) and well written; Franz Antel&apos;s direction is above his standard here.\n\nThe operetta and revue interludes are nice and the can-can is surely worth watching. The cast is fine (even Rudolf Prack is not as deathly as usual) and has fun. Two (very different) comics of the old guard are here: Hans Moser and Oskar Sima; both are good, but it is easy to see that Moser is the more natural one.",

      "name": "Emotionally draining but truly moving &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; story",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Hunt&quot; is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\n\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I&apos;ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I&apos;ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\n\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen&apos;s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won&apos;t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp&apos;s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she&apos;s in.\n\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children&apos;s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\n\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund&apos;s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer&apos;s imagination, which chill to the bone.\n\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn&apos;t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\n\n&quot;The Hunt&quot; was easily the saddest film I&apos;ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It&apos;s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that&apos;s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\n\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but &quot;The Hunt&quot; is one of the most affecting and emotional films I&apos;ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.",

      "reviewBody": "After reading some of the other reviews on this film I felt compelled to write a review. True Romance is my favourite film of all time. True Romance was not a film that got dusted off in the midst of Tarantino fever and is not attempting to be &quot;Tarantino&apos;esq&quot; in its direction. Actually this was the first script that he ever wrote. It was penned whilst he was working in a video and comic store in Amsterdam. He rented the apartment above- anybody who has seen this film will know the parallels with Clarence Worley. Tarantino was actually trying to get his work taken on at the time by some film companies and he requested Scott because he loved his early work. It is true that later on Tarantino kicked up a fuss because they altered the ending and he criticised Scott for making it too Hollywood. Clarence dies in the original script! Anyway Scott agreed to make both endings and let Tarantino watch them, Tarantino then conceded he preferred the new version. The film wasn&apos;t trying to be Tarantino-esq that part was just the authors input on the film which is not common when people are making films like Harry Potter as the author has no knowledge of film but it is very common when working with screenwriters! This film is the most romantic film i have ever seen, brilliant characters, amazing sound track, brilliant acting &amp; the cast alone informs us that this is one of the best films ever made. Brad Pitt was asked to be a lead character in the film but was working on another at the time. Pitt wanted to be involved so badly that he flew in for a days shooting just to do 6 lines as room mate Floydd. &quot;and some cleaning products&quot; was ad-libbed! Just see this film."

Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98&apos;, but when you watch it, its somewhat like, &quot;OK, let me guess, Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a &apos;pause for laughter&apos; moment?&quot; Yup.\n\nIs Sandler going to do a stupid voice the whole movie and end on a &apos;touching theme&apos;?. Yup.\n\nActing is good, I will give it that. However, if you have seen any Adam Sandler movie, then you won&apos;t be surprised with his acting choices.

      "reviewBody": "The documentary director Frederick Wiseman, has been much acclaimed for his bare and non-narrative style. He just places a camera somewhere and register what happens. No information about the action or the people involved is given. But Wiseman did choose the locations. He did choose what to register. And for how long each set and set of actions are supposed to roll. (And that is long, very long). The result is a deceptively documentary narrative about the Paris Opera. But the story told is of course Wiseman&apos;s interpretation of the Paris Opera.\n\nWe all know that documentaries are the result of a personal vision, there is no such thing as objectivity. But we have to remind ourselves of this watching La Danse, as it is seemingly devoid of valuation.\n\nHere are some examples of what Wiseman chooses to show and emphasize (randomly presented à la Wiseman): Dancers do not talk with each other. Dancers are silent, anonymous people. The artistic director never looses her temper. Almost no one in this movie loses his or her temper. The only black people at the Paris Opera are cleaners or cashiers. The food in the Opera&apos;s canteen is pale and colorless, like hospital food. The bread in the canteen is guillotined. The modern ballets of the Paris Opera are full of violence, anger and frustration. The longest ballet scene in the movie is a literal blood bath from Medea. Even the scenes from the Nut Cracker look drab and dull. The whole film is dark and gloomy, probably because of the lighting. The dimly lit corridors of the Opera house are narrow and empty of people. The film starts and ends in the claustrophobic catacombs under the Opera House. OK, just a few examples but they say something of Wisemans perspective.\n\nThis film has nevertheless its fascinating moments, especially the meetings in the artistic directors office. But never have dance and ballet had this joy-less outlook in a movie before. And never before have the images of the roof tops of Paris (frequently interspersed throughout the movie) appeared so refreshing after the sombre rehearsal studios of the Paris Opera.",

      "reviewBody": "Pizza (2012) : Brief Review -\n\nProbably, The best use of &quot;Deux Ex Machina&quot; ever done in thriller genre. Meet World&apos;s First horror-con-thriller ever. I think i have given away too much in the first two lines only which might turn a big spoiler unless you don&apos;t think about it too much. So, first you should know what is &quot;Deux Ex Machina&quot;. If you know it then it&apos;s great and if you don&apos;t then please go to Wikipedia and read about it there. That will save some copy-paste work for me in this BRIEF review. So, now you know what that term means basically and let me tell you it&apos;s not complex as you think. Actually, we all have been through it with many comedy films over the years but just didn&apos;t think that it could mean something intricate like this. So better leave it UNSOLVED and that&apos;s what it means here. Pizza is horror film but we all know that there&apos;s nothing like ghosts and all so we start finding solid reasons for it. Remember, Malayalam Classic &apos;Manichitrathazu&apos;? Even that belongs to horror genre but as we all know it&apos;s not a real thing so we start finding logic into it. That film provides it by the perfect use of Psychological medical terms so while watching Pizza you also wish there would be something logical at the end to cover all the unrealistic loopes. It&apos;s a sign of an intelligent movie viewer who easily don&apos;t believe in spilled stuff and rather likes to wait for intriguing turnarounds. With Pizza, the same thing happens. They show you horror images because you are a smart movie buff, you don&apos;t believe it and wait for the suspense to get revealed. A pizza delivery boy lands in a mysterious circumstance and it works a dramatic change in his life. I am not spoiling anything here because i want you to watch the film without any speculations and i am sure it will blow you away. It&apos;s little predictable but still very hooked and surprising. Thanks to Team Pizza for trying something different and for me that&apos;s the best thing about it.\n\nRATING - 8/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest.",

Hardy Kruger turns in a amusing performance and my favorite, Stephen Boyd, seems to be having a pretty good time in his cowboy role as well. This is a German film and one of Stephen Boyd&apos;s last, released just before his premature passing in 1977 just as he was making a return to films as a supporting character actor rather than the leading man roles he played in the 60&apos;s films.  He was a well-seasoned, solid actor and it&apos;s unfortunate for us that he didn&apos;t have the chance to make more films like this one.",

A sensitive and poetic film of this class sank at the box office, leading to the death of its producer Shailendra due to financial crisis. This film is today recognized as one of the best movie by all critics and actors. Film is based on a story of the Phanishwer Nath Renu, one of renowned Hindi writers.\n\nThis film portrays story of Hiraman, a bullock cart driver and a dancer Hirabai. Hirabai is attracted to Hiraman due to his simplicity. She is going to a fair by Hiraman&apos;s bullock cart to perform in drama. The bond between two grows stronger as the day passes at fair. But finally as the fair comes closer to end, the parting seems imminent due to external factors. Finally when fair is over, Hirabai has to go and two separates.\n\nTo quote Star and Style&apos;s review of the film, &quot;The way the cart driver and nautanki dancer meet, talk and discover each other and themselves at the same time and the manner in which they part are like a poem on celluloid with a thread of pain running through it.&quot; Raj Kapoor and Vaheeda Rehamn has given the best performances of their career. Songs are worth listening for hours. A must watch.",

      "reviewBody": "While &apos;Three Colours: White&apos; may be the weakest of Krzysztof Kieslowski&apos;s &quot;Three Colours Trilogy&quot;, that is in no way saying that it is a bad film (to me it was actually still an extremely good one) and that it&apos;s testament to the trilogy&apos;s consistently high overall quality.\n\n&apos;Three Colours: White&apos; could have been a little longer to give more development to the two leads&apos; relationship and to Julie Delpy&apos;s character perhaps, and there are a couple of parts that do strain credibility. On the whole though, it is an entertaining, sad and thought-provoking examination of equality and revenge with a story detailing love on the rocks and the aftermath of Poland&apos;s Communist Regime.\n\nAgain it is very symbolic, especially in the linking to the protagonist&apos;s past (this time with a coin and a Marianna plaster bust) and again the recycling of bottles that ties in with the film&apos;s main theme of equality. This symbolism is this said intriguing and visually arresting, instead of being incoherent, one may not get the significance of it at first but reading up about the film and analyses of it has proved to be tremendously insightful.\n\nVisually, &apos;Three Colours: White&apos; is every bit as visually stunning as the previous film &apos;Three Colours: Blue&apos;. The scenery is intentionally not flattering but at the same time it is also affectionate, and the film is exquisitely shot with the use of colour bold and striking. The music is not quite as symbolic as in &apos;Blue&apos;, but is still very much inspired and cleverly used, with a dark jauntiness to match the blackly comedic nature of the film and also a little pathos to mirror the emotions of the protagonist.\n\nWriting is of the true black comedy/dry humour kind, enough to make one laugh heartily and cry unashamedly, with plenty of funny and poignant moments as well as blunt and thought-provoking ones. Kieslowski&apos;s direction is never intrusive.\n\nZbigniew Zamachowski excels par excellence in his tragicomic role, a very funny and nuanced turn. Julie Delpy&apos;s role is not as interesting, but she does bring a formidable edge and sensuality to it.\n\nOn the whole, the weakest of the trilogy but still extremely good. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The film centers on the prejudice experienced by a Korean teenager living in Japan; he doesn&apos;t fit in with Koreans or the Japanese. But he utters many times in the film, &quot;This is my love story,&quot; and while he does have a love interest, it is a rather small part. I liked how this film looked at the different tensions of race, life, and love.\n\nThe acting was pretty great. The lead actor was very convincing as the teenager who is conflicted between two identities. He overacted the last scene, but there is this one very beautiful scene where he just sits and talks to a police officer. It&apos;s pretty awesome: very simple and beautiful. Kou Shibasaki as his love interest is pretty good as well, and she won the Japanese equivalent of the Oscar for her role in this. She makes the most of the relatively short amount of screen time she has, and we can see why the main character would fall in love with her.\n\nNot the best Japanese movie I&apos;ve ever seen, but still pretty good. Worth your while. 7/10",

The movie is colorful, the actors are good, the plot is magical and captivating, lots of battle scenes and martial arts.\n\nThe one thing that you should keep in mind when you decide to go and watch it, however, is that there&apos;s one important difference between &quot;Promise&quot; and &quot;Tiger/Dragon&quot;, for example. While the latter was mainly about the martial arts, magical swords and true warriors searching for their destiny and characters&apos; relationship remained peacefully in the background, &quot;the Promise&quot;, despite its many combat scenes and stuff like this, is a love story, a fairy tale. Which makes it sort of similar to the &quot;House of flying daggers&quot;.\n\nThe flaws? Well, I suppose there&apos;re some, because nothing is perfect. But, personally, I didn&apos;t notice any.\n\nIt&apos;s a beautiful love story and it&apos;s worth watching. There&apos;s a right time for everything and there are not many bad movies....\n\nEnjoy it!"

      "reviewBody": "Kiri Davis has addressed some things that SHOULD be talked about much more--and these are the cultural standards that make black women seem less than ideal. In other words, pop culture (movies, magazines and the internet, among others) seem to say that black women are BEST if they are lighter-skinned, have straighter hair and act &apos;less black&apos;. This is such a wonderful thing to address as it&apos;s horribly stupid to make value judgments based on such superficial and stupid standards. The impact of this on all black women (light and dark skinned) is discussed--some of this through interviews with YOUNG* black women as well as a discussion of Dr. Kenneth Clark&apos;s social psychology experiment that showed kids (black and non-black) would favor white baby dolls**.\n\nIf you&apos;d like to see this short, get the DVD entitled &quot;Sixth Media That Matters Film Festival&quot;. As for me, I&apos;d love to see more work from this clever woman.\n\n*My only complaint about the film, and it&apos;s very minor, is that we only heard from young black women. I really would have loved to have heard from a broader age spectrum, though I cannot fault the filmmaker as I assumed she mostly interviewed students at her school. Plus, this is her only film credit--so I don&apos;t want to demand too much from her. She did a great job as it is.\n\n**Although in the 1960s experiment, kids did strongly favor white dolls, I&apos;d love to see a large study try to replicate the results today. I assume (hopefully) that the results would be much different today--and just interviewing a few kids today doesn&apos;t really do Clark&apos;s study justice. For a doctoral or masters level psychology graduate student, this would be a great dissertation of thesis topic.",

      "reviewBody": "An absent minded professor discovers a new type of rubber that can be harnessed as an energy source.  However his discovery causes him to miss his wedding and lose his girlfriend.  While trying to demonstrate his discovery to Sara Jean to win her back, he gets the attention of mobster Hoenicker who wants the discovery for himself.\n\nThe story here is unimportant - it&apos;s all a bit daft and if you look too closely at it, it all falls apart.  For example - the professor has created a flying robot that has full intelligence and character but yet he hasn&apos;t made any money for himself or his college!, is the flubber alive or not? etc.  But really it&apos;s all about the set pieces and the jokes.  As such it falls down a little - it&apos;s good for kids but there&apos;s nothing in the crude slapstick for adults.  Jokes include the usual &quot;people getting hit in the head&quot; style humour.\n\nWilliams character is not funny at all - a bit of a weakness in a comedy lead.  In fact his forgetfulness is just stupid at times and doesn&apos;t have any charm to cover it.  The funniest bits actually revolve around McDonald&apos;s Wilson - he doesn&apos;t get good lines but he has lots of incidental laughs. Ted Levine and Clancy Brown have both done better than this and are limited to comedy thugs - although both were probably glad to be in a big movie. Other well known faces include Raymond J. Barry and Wil Wheaton, although these are also underused.  It&apos;s not really a movie about performances but I think it&apos;s still important.\n\nThe best characters are Weebo and the flubber.  Weebo is quite funny and actually has a deep character - she&apos;s the secretary in love with her boss type - she also creates a strangely moving scene.  The flubber is good - best in one big musical number halfway through and I wonder if they could have had more imaginative scenes with it as a character rather than just a bouncy ball.\n\nOverall it&apos;s a kids film - don&apos;t expect anything more than that."

      "reviewBody": "Robert Stevenson (1905-1986) was a superb British director, but his name is not widely enough recognised. He is probably most famous for JANE EYRE (1944) with Orson Welles and TOM BROWN&apos;S SCHOOLDAYS (1940). Less well known are his excellent DISHONORED LADY (1947, see my review), and his truly magnificent OWD BOB (1938, see my review), which he made the year after this. In this year, he also made KING SOLOMON&apos;S MINES with Anna Lee, who stars once again in this film of his. This really is a most fascinating film, because of the spectacular second half which takes place on a trans-Atlantic Clipper seaplane, the interior of which resembles that of a zeppelin, on multiple levels with individual sleeping compartments, bar and restaurant. It even has a little balcony where people stand outside to take the air and look down upon the ships which are not far below them. Francis L. Sullivan here gives one of his finest performances as the oiliest and least scrupulous of villains, truly hair-raising in his wickedness. Anna Lee is a typical 1930s English &apos;sweetie&apos;, but with more fibre and character than is usual for that time, and she handles the part of the courageous accidental heroine very well. She is determined to save the wrong man from being executed in America for a crime he did not commit. Anna stows away on the Clipper to get back to America to give her evidence, which Scotland Yard had refused to take seriously. This is very much a Hitchcock-style suspense thriller, and makes excellent viewing. It deserves to be more widely known, as it is certainly a British pre-War classic. If Britain had as many film buffs as there are in America, where almost any trivial B or C movie can achieve fame nowadays, films like this would be familiar and praised, rather than obscure and forgotten. But the British are lazy about their cinematic heritage, and films like this are never shown on British television, so no one even knows they exist. In this film, the child actor Desmond Tester is most amusing as an eccentric child musical prodigy who becomes entangled in the murderous intrigues going on aboard the Clipper plane. If only British films still produced wonderfully strange character actors like that! It was also amusing to see a young Peter Bull scowling with his heavy jowls as a blackmailer in this film. In real life, he was actually rather jolly, although extraordinarily bombastic and often too loud, and he was always available for a chat when he ran his astrological shop in Notting Hill Gate in the 1960s and 1970s.",

It is superbly directed by Shakti Shamantha (his best effort).\n\nThe film takes a look at how society views women who have been forced into the sex trade. Their sensitivities, insecurities etc., are so beautifully touched upon.\n\nThe music of the film is by R.D Buraman, a Kaka favorite. All the songs are gems. Specially the &quot;Chingari koi badke&quot; song.\n\nSharmila tagore has mentioned how Kaka had so masterfully performed in this song in the very limited space they had i.e in a small boat.\n\nIt is a lifetime role for sharmila tagore &amp; she makes full use of it. She surely deserved the national award &amp; it is a wonder how she missed it.\n\nThe supporting star cast of Madan Puri, Vinod Mehra &amp; Om Prakash are adequate.\n\nComing to the hero of the film, the eternal superstar Rajesh khanna. He was at his zenith when this film released.\n\nIt was reported that when the film crew asked for police permission to shoot the &quot;Chingari koi badke&quot; song near the howrah bridge, the police denied permission stating that they would not be able to control the crowds &amp; that the bridge may collapse. Eventually, the song was shot in a studio set. Such was the popularity Rajesh commanded.\n\nIn spite of his super stardom, as is his wont, he did not think twice about accepting this role knowing fully well that this film centers around the heroine. The beauty is he comes out unscathed. He looks handsome in his Bengali dhoti &amp; underplays superbly. The end scenes specially show kaka at his best.\n\nDefinitely a film which comes in the top 3 of kaka&apos;s films &amp; eternally loved by Rajesh khanna fans.\n\nWatch it over &amp; over again. You will never feel bored.",

It appears as if Godard had deliberately chosen Dutronc for that role keeping in mind their own erratic behavioral patterns.Nathalie Baye is acceptable in her role as the hapless girl friend of this eccentric director.The most challenging and in some sense controversial part has been played by Isabelle Huppert as an innocent prostitute who silently bears all the ill treatment meted to her by her clients.This is a good psychological film directed by Godard about the emotional stagnation of some characters who are unable to come out of their mental framework.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film on April 5th, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival&apos;s Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture &quot;explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.&quot; Heartland gave that award to this film.\n\nThis film is about a 12 year old boy growing up and coming of age in a small, picturesque town in the Midwest. Even though his family is of modest means, he has an ideal life with a loving family consisting of his father, mother, two little sisters, and his beagle dog, Shiloh.\n\nThe boy takes on a challenge. He befriends an old, cantankerous man who has no friends or family, and is rumored to be involved in everything from dog beating, to burglary, and even to a current murder investigation. This old man was abused as a child and seems to be a hopeless cause. His cause seems hopeless not only because of his behavior, but also because he is forever the victim of gossip. The boy looks for the good in the old man even though he is not sure if he will succeed or whether the old man is capable of change.\n\nAlong the way, the boy confronts other challenges closer to home. He has a senile Grandmother who appears to be an Alzheimer victim and is difficult to love. He also has a rebellious young sister who is a constant pain.\n\nDisplaying sacrifice and compassion well beyond his years, the boy learns valuable lessons about life. However, this is not a preachy movie. The morality statements are understated, and the children are surprisingly fine actors who mostly display the fun of being young and open and naive. The whole family can enjoy this movie, which is part mystery, part adventure and part family drama.\n\nFYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",

They end up opening the eyes of a group of rich and spoiled young girls, getting chased by the police, getting attacked by jealous jocks, and everyone else that they come across, both gay and straight, end up all either falling in love with them or being admirers of them. A couple people end up actually dying too! This film has everything!!!! \n\nNo, but seriously, the plot of this film may sound kind of like a cross between Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off and The Warriors, which isn&apos;t far from the truth. I&apos;d almost call it a remake of The Warriors if I weren&apos;t such a purist. Either way though, I had so much fun with this film. Within ten minutes I ended up falling in love with all these boys and I especially loved how genuine they are about everything. They consistently remain true to each other, which is so rare in youth-related films today. They are all brave and good natured. They aren&apos;t violent, they don&apos;t do drugs, and they are charming in a weird way. I would probably not be bothered by the idea of them hanging out with my nephew. They really lend a lot of energy to the film, which helps the film stay more focused on the surroundings rather than plot, and this really isn&apos;t the kind of film that should have a plot, or at least a complicated one.\n\nThis film likely won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s cup of tea. The subject matter, relating to gang violence, punk rock, and skateboarding will not appeal to a lot of viewers. In addition to that, most will not appreciate the blatant stereotypes of all the characters surrounding this group of boys. I personally was not bothered by most of it. I felt that it somewhat helped define the characters a little bit more by allowing them to roam in an environment that wasn&apos;t reality and was somewhat simple. I did find the one scene with the Charlton Heston lookalike to be a little too tasteless, but I was too entertained and fascinated by what was going on to really be much bothered by it.\n\nI think that this is one of Larry Clark&apos;s strongest films. It&apos;s not quite as good as BULLY, but it&apos;s not really the same kind of film either. WASSUP ROCKERS is really more of an entertainment picture. This is pretty much Larry Clark&apos;s lightest and most positive film, though when the darker situations come into play Larry Clark goes all the way with it. WASSUP ROCKERS is entertaining, moving, scary, hilarious, and bizarre. It&apos;s very fast paced, so even if you dislike the film it will be out of your system before you know it. In short, this is a great film and I applaud Larry Clark for pulling off such a fun film."

This film is set mostly in the villages of Tamil Nadu and one gets a beautiful nostalgic feeling of the serenity of villages in this film.\n\nThough the script depicts an action film with no new concept- a hero, his heroine, a villain and so on, there are developments one can witness in this film that makes it different from others. For one, the heroine, Meera Jasmine, does most of the comedy and the rejoicing in most segments is appealing.\n\nWatching a relative newcomer, vishal reddy, playing his first-time action role with ease is amazing. Never before have I seen a hero so befitting the action image and delivering his dialogues with dollops of power punches.\n\nThere are no flaws in the films. If there are, they are extremely hard to notice. And I&apos;m not an action film fan, but this film made my day.",

It&apos;s really amazing how well the film has held up after nearly thirty-years and it&apos;s clear that there&apos;s no slowing down as the series continues to get sequels. With that said, as good as some of the sequels are, they can&apos;t compare to the original film, which had Chucky being one evil maniac.\n\nThe film works on many levels but the best thing about it is that it goes against the majority of the slasher films that were out around this time. Instead of just trying to come up with creative kills, this film instead plays out like a thriller and on this level it works. The story of the single mother and her son is a great set-up and this really adds to the drama. Even better is the relationship between the cop and the mother as this added even more drama that plays itself out well against the horror elements. Then you&apos;ve got a great killer in the Chucky doll but there&apos;s also the entire story dealing with the serial killer played by Brad Dourif.\n\nThe special effects are also another major plus and especially how perfectly blended the mechanical Chucky was as well as the moments where he&apos;s being played by an actor. THe film manages to have some nice suspense and is certainly very well directed by Tom Holland. The film is certainly one of the better horror films from the later day slasher era."

      "reviewBody": "One of silent cinema&apos;s greatest pairings, Greta Garbo and John Gilbert starred together one last time in Queen Christina. Gilbert&apos;s career was in tatters by 1933 after a string on failures, and Laurence Olivier had already bailed from the role, but Garbo insisted on Gilbert. And he is wonderful as the Spanish envoy. He looks great and gives a sly performance with plenty of wit. This is also one of Garbo&apos;s best talkies. Together they light up the screen. This film also boasts some of the most gorgeous close ups of Garbo you&apos;ve ever seen. Solid historical drama of Swedish queen who abdicates for love. Good supporting cast includes Lewis Stone, Reginald Owen, Akim Tamiroff, Ian Keith as the slimy Magnus, C. Aubrey Smith, Elizabeth Young, and David Torrence. Beautiful film with solid performances and, dare I say, very feminist in its view. Gilbert&apos;s performance in this film and Downstairs (1932) should have put him back on top. What a shame. Norma Desmond was right when she said, &quot;They took the idols and they smashed them. The The Gilberts, the Fairbankses, the Valentinos.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "This second part is a follow-up to ¨Shangai noon¨with the likeable starring(Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson) . When the killers murder Chon&apos;s estranged father he flees. He goes London to retrieve a brilliant royal object that Jackie Chan&apos;s father guarded in the forbidden city Pekin when he was murdered by some Chinese rebels . Roy also escapes to England, and he and Chon make their way to London with revenge on their minds. And Chon&apos;s sister, Lin, has the same idea. They meet Victoria queen (Gemma Jones) and a roguish street boy called Charles Chaplin . They&apos;ll confront the villains (Aidan Gillen and Donnie Yen) which want to overthrow the British and China thrones and nasty Chinese Boxers and even Jack the Ripper (Oliver Cotton). Meanwhile, Owen Wilson falls in love with Chan&apos;s sister (Fam Wong).\n\nJackie Chan and Owen Wilson give a jolly and perfect couple . It&apos;s usual in Chan films create duos , a ¨buddy movie¨ type , as male : Chris Tucker (Rush hour I and II) , as female : Jennifer Love Hewitt (the Tuxedo) and Claire Forlani (The medallion) and here magnificently with Wilson . Here they uncover a worldwide conspiracy to murder the royal family but almost no one will believe them . The choreographic fights are excellent , they are made as musical numbers, there are remembrances to ¨singing in the rain¨dancing as well as Harold Lloyd , Keistone cops and to author Arthur Conan Doyle with his Sherlock Holmes creation . It&apos;s an agreeable picture but uneven comedy, works better when Jackie Chan goes into the action . It&apos;s a Chan vehicle for the continuous struggles in leaps and bounds .The final confrontation among the starring and the enemies on the Thames river with fireworks background and in the Big clock tower are overwhelming and breathtaking . Cinematography (Adrian Biddle) and music (Randy Edelman) are spectacular and atmospheric. Production set is extraordinary, it&apos;s very well designed along London epoch . The picture was rightly directed by David Dobkin. Rating : Nice and bemusing .",

However a meeting with them and Raymond Delauney sees Palfrey made to look a fool by the caddish Delauney.  To counter his wishy washy ways, Palfrey joins the `Lifemanship&apos; school of Mr Potter.  Here he learns all the ploys of a cad.  Upon completion of the course he sets his sight on Delauney  but can he avoid becoming that which he hates?\n\nTerry Thomas is famous for his lecherous wretch and here he not only plays it to perfection, but also gets out played at his own game.  The plot here is in three acts.  Firstly the caddish Delauney outplays Palfrey. Second act Palfrey attends the school and finally Palfrey returns to his life a changed man.  All three acts play out very well for different reasons, only the end of act 3 drags a little bit but ends well.  The gentle comedy of the time runs through it  it is a very English film in its own way.  I enjoyed the vast majority of it.\n\nIan Carmichael appears a weak choice for the lead but his transformation from coward to cad is well played and he was actually very good.  Thomas is well cast although this is what he is famous for I suppose.  Sim is pretty good but given too little to do and there are some nice little cameos from Hattie Jacques and (even better) John Le Mesurier.\n\nOverall this is very slight but it is also very enjoyable.  It isn&apos;t hilarious but it is a very enjoyable film with a good sense of wicked humour running through the film."

Their demanding captain refuses to give the men shore leave with the beautiful island girls. Abner (Dana Andrews) and Tom (Don Dubbins) decide to jump ship and head for their imagined paradise.\n\nThis is a B-movie and it&apos;s a rather boring one. It&apos;s more important as one of the last few production by RKO before its bankruptcy. It&apos;s a fitting movie to show the decline of the once great studio. It&apos;s got great palm trees in the Acapulco adjacent locations. That&apos;s the best part of the movie.",

This guy has absolutely no talent, he does not understand the concept of surrealism, he makes self-indulgent, extremely amateurish no-budget films and thinks of himself as a big artist and drops big surrealist/horror names on his DVDs, e.g. Alejandro Jodorowsky. Sorry buddy, but these shoes will never fit you, no matter how hard you try.\n\nHe has no idea of how to direct, how to set light, use the camera, of timing etc. Only the score is sometimes interesting, but not subtle.\n\nThe guy who plays the hit-man looks like an 18 year old and has - of course - absolutely no acting talent, he even grins his way to some of the gore scenes. The story is nothing else than a bold statement without anything on the screen to support it. The gore and horror looks like its been done from 14 years old fan boys, I don&apos;t know how people can be disturbed or shocked by this ridiculous joke of a movie.\n\nThe same goes for Iskanov&apos;s &quot;Visions of Suffering&quot;, its even more boring and filled with pathetic random imagery, which has absolutely nothing to do with surrealism or artistic expression, its just clumsy and shallow.\n\nDon&apos;t waste your money or time on releases of this guy, he&apos;s just not capable to deliver anything interesting now or in the future but is a loudmouth playing around with big topics like Japanese Unit 731. Gosh! Get a life, Mr. Iskanov.",

Two very close friends promise each other, that if one gets a son and the other a daughter, they shall be married when they grow up. They actually do get a son and a daughter, bit they never get the chance to see them grow up, while the children instinctively feel they belong to each other, while the adoptive family of the daughter prevents their union, with fatal consequences. It is actually a monumental tragedy but wrapped up in an incredible and comprehensive play involving many people, festivities, ceremonies, dances, songs, enormous circumstances and overwhelming passions, while it&apos;s the music that is especially impressing. It is as if music was the dominating element in the lives of these Polish Jews, and the film gives a very strong impression of the vital importance of music in all aspects of Jewish life. The film is unforgettable in its overwhelming richness of images and feelings, the unique filming of services, celebrations and ceremonies inside the Synagogue, in brief, everything in this film is exceptionally fantastic.",

Federico Fellini speaks candidly about his way of making movies and about himself.\n\nOnly a few of his collaborators were called upon to talk about the maestro. Fellini was a figure larger than life; his pictures were the way for him to express his ideas to his audience. It&apos;s curious only three actors were selected for the documentary: Donald Sutherland, Terence Stamp and Roberto Benigni. Omitted from it were collaborators like Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee, Anita Ekberg and other living actors that are still living who could have added their views to the documentary.\n\nHaving seen &quot;The Magic of Fellini&quot;, directed by Carmen Piccini, Damian Pettygrew&apos;s film doesn&apos;t add anything that had not been known before as Fellini remains a figure that had all the ideas in his mind, but it seems he was a man whose way of working depended a lot on the improvisation he brought to the set on any given moment.\n\nMr. Pettygrew finds parallels between Fellini and Guido, his character of &quot;8-1/2&quot;, who was at best, an enigma because everything he had stored in his head and how, at times, it was so hard for him to communicate the ideas to the people he was working with, at the time.\n\n&quot;Je suis un grand menteur&quot; is a must see for all Fellini fans.",

      "reviewBody": "People say that all you need  to make a movie nowadays are a couple of actors in front of a greenscreen. The Jerry Cotton series proves they were doing it forty years ago, only with back projection. The series of bi weekly pulp novels were brought to the screen starring Rock Hudson&apos;s friend Georg Nader, and using the most American looking Germans they could find as support. This is the third entry, in which the crafty G-man has to find a stolen truckload of nitroglycerin (Wo is der Nitro?) before the stockshots of New York city surrounding him are evaporated.\n\nYou gotta be amazed by the sheer amount of grainy and faded footage of the Big Apple they found for every occasion (though sometimes it looks looks more like Vegas). Only once did they have to go out and film near some real life bushes. None of the cars have any windows either, leading to a crazy sequence where Cotton is disguised as a window cleaner to spy on some thugs. They try to shoot him but only hit glass and he almost falls to his death. At that moment his useless partner Phil walks in from the other side and gets hit on the head with the glass from a car window! This was probably cheaper to get than a breakable vase and also meant they could use the same sound effect twice.\n\nThis is the sort of series Roger Corman would have made had he lived outside of the U.S. (Rogier Kormann?). Bad guys include a jewelery stealin&apos; platinum blonde and a crime boss who is lying down all the time (being massaged, having a steam bath or just relaxing while his cronies torture people). One of the best things is the soundtrack which changes style (cocktail music, blues) per scene. Jerry himself seems to have the Shadows as a backing group and sometimes we here &quot;Thomas Crown Affair&quot; like madness going on complete with incomprehensible lyrics. Time is running out and the temperature is rising, but it proves hard to get excited about action sequences on top of a bridge or in front of a train when there is such an obviously difference between the fore- and background.\n\n5 out of 10 for effort"

      "reviewBody": "The Lost World is the sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park. Whilst this film is not as good as the original it does stand up well as a sequel. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm has been asked to return to another Island were Dinosaurs have been allowed to live without cages. Malcolm refuses but when he finds out his paleontolagist girlfriend is already there he goes with a team of documentariens to rescue her. However several accidents ensue and they are left stranded on the Island with a second party. The film does not have the all round strength of the first and is far more dependant on thrills and its visual effects this time round. It does however succeed as good entertainment and its better than the third installment in the franchise by quite a bit. The Dino sequences are handled well with the Raptors in the long grass being the highlight of those and quite possibly the entire film. The T-rex features strongly again ( and this time there&apos;s two of them) along with a new and nasty little green dinosaur compsagnathus. The acting is&apos;nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us. So I think its fair we overlook some of its flaws as with any kind of blockbuster sequel they are always there.",

In the worst way possible, that is. Basically, there is no ending. When you begin hoping that something interesting will actually start to happen and save the movie from oblivion, in fact it smartly decides to end.\n\nThe whole film builds up slowly towards a climax that never happens, because it ends prematurely, and you&apos;re left with a perplexed look on your face, wondering what the hell was in your head when you decided to watch this.\n\nIt looks like all the guys involved in production decided among themselves: &quot;Let&apos;s pull a prank on the viewers and only make half of a movie. Then we&apos;ll have a good laugh looking at their faces as they watch the credits in awe.&quot;\n\nWell, news flash gentlemen: The joke is on you. ;)"

      "reviewBody": "&apos;A Visit to the Louvre&apos;, is Strab and Houllet&apos;s companion piece to their earlier film &apos;Cezanne&apos;, which are both drawn from letters exchanged between Cezanne and his friend, art critic Joachim Gasquet. Both films follow a similar format with narration drawn from the text of Cezanne&apos;s letters played predominately still images. &apos;A visit to the Louvre&apos; is the more tightly structured of the two which, aside from an opening panning shot of the building, is composed of images of the art Cezanne is critiquing.\n\nAs a film, this is difficult to categorise, Straub and Huillet always actively worked against convention, even in terms of running times (this is an awkward 45mins). This is not exactly a documentary, it simply presents one person&apos;s perspective on a relatively small selection of paintings. That said, the idea of &apos;recreating&apos;, in a very constrained style, the experience of walking through the Louvre with Cezanne, as Gasquet did, is a fascinating one. That won&apos;t translate into a fascinating film for audiences beyond serious art lovers (and even they many lose patience), but as always with Straub and Huillet, the ambition is admirable.",

With his hot body, hairy chest, hard tools and as a pure Top he is one of the best and hottest looking gay performers ever. This guy is pure male! The movie is all Arabian style with a gay fairytale feeling. My personal favorite scene is when Huessein f**** Sarib. If you wanna know what the guys in Arabia really do watch this movie. This movie doesn&apos;t really have a plot ore story (it would have been nice to hear the guys speak), but as a whole this movie is in one word HOT! The 2 disc DVD version has great bonus specials.",

This movie was filled with laughs, but still managed to tell a truly genuine story. A story about people that get trapped in their dead end jobs, and struggle to find happiness and try to decide what they want in life. Eventually teaching acceptance and promoting individualism rather than trying to live up to some kind of social standard.\n\nI was very impressed with the casting, everyone was great, and it was great to see some familiar faces, Afflec and Lee really left an impression even though they were only present in one scene each. Smith really presents a dramatic tone with his directing, a tone which is rarely set nowadays with most directors trying to match the style of Spielberg, Hitchcock, or (insert successful director here), and leave the movie looking like an impression, Smith isn&apos;t afraid to use his own style. Most movies today are very cookie cutter, but this is a refreshing change. What happened to directors just directing, instead of trying to follow a formula to get rich? Smith is a genuine and modest filmmaker, we can only hope that he keeps making movies, and maybe he&apos;ll inspire more &quot;Hollywood&quot; directors to stick to good/original material rather than weak big budget movies with all the latest young stars stinking up the screen. Cheers to Kevin Smith, cheers to Clerks II.\n\n9 / 10"

      "reviewBody": "This 2009 Chilean film, based on the diary of one of the inmates, depicts a group of prominent Chilean political prisoners in the 1970s. After the government of elected &quot;Socialist&quot; President Salvador Allende was ousted in 1973, in a CIA-engineered coup d&apos;état led by army general-turned-dictator, Augusto Pinochet, ten surviving members of Allende&apos;s cabinet were consigned to a navy-run prison camp on the cold and forbidding Dawson Island, in the Strait of Magellan, a region infamous for some of the world&apos;s worst weather.\n\nOn the surface, as a prisoner-of-war film, &quot;Dawson Island 10&quot; has the expected dramatic tension. Despised as &quot;Communists&quot; and &quot;traitors&quot; by most of their captors, the inmates are forced to perform hard labor under punishing conditions and are routinely insulted and degraded. The living conditions portrayed in the film, however, including comfortable-looking beds and bedding, are at odds with the descriptions of squalor that appeared in later authoritative government and international reports. The prison commandant, an old-school naval officer, is shown giving lip service to honoring the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war and believing that he is &quot;rehabilitating&quot; his captives, turning them into &quot;better people&quot; through hard labor. The film indicates that, with time, he develops a degree of respect for their intelligence and abilities. (They repair his malfunctioning radio.) It also shows him resisting subordinate army officers who agitate repeatedly for solving the growing problem of prison overcrowding by executing some or all of the prisoners. Instead, he orders the building of more barracks. The film depicts the transfer back to the mainland (amidst dire forebodings) of ailing former Defense Minister Jose Toha. It does not, however, show his actual fate at his destination, the Air Force War Academy in Santiago: endless tortures followed by hanging. Even if the film&apos;s portrayal of the Dawson Island prison commandant&apos;s humanity was accurate, it would be a great mistake to conclude that this behavior was typical of the Chilean Navy. In fact, its Admiral Merino was one of the principal coup leaders and the Naval War Academy in Valparaiso was one of the regime&apos;s most notorious torture/murder centers.\n\nAs a historical political document, however, &quot;Dawson Island 10&quot; fails utterly. Instead of analyzing the suicidal policies of Allende &amp; Co. in their &quot;peaceful, parliamentary road to socialism,&quot; it surrounds the fallen &quot;Comrade President&quot; with a halo of near-religious awe and perpetuates those fatal myths. One of the former cabinet members speaks glowingly about their desire to &quot;take power without firing a shot.&quot; No one speaks out against this idiocy. Several of them, bemoaning their fate, cry out: &quot;how did this happen?&quot;, &quot;what did we do wrong&quot;? It was all I could do to restrain myself from yelling at the top of my voice &quot;you let the fascist bastards take power, that&apos;s what you did wrong!&quot; It was not only these prisoners who appear to have learned NOTHING from the overthrow of the Allende regime. The filmmakers seem to have learned nothing as well. They raised not the slightest challenge to the deeply Stalinist and reformist notion that capitalism can be overthrown from WITHIN the system — one of the deadliest political illusions in today&apos;s world. As Karl Marx wrote after the French capitalists crushed the glorious Paris Commune of 1871: &quot;the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes.&quot; On the contrary, it is necessary for the workers to DESTROY the capitalists&apos; state machinery and replace it with a state that advances the interests of THEIR class. If only that lesson would be learned, the Chilean martyrs will not have suffered and died in vain.\n\nBarry Freed",

They find more then the expected there. This is a very funny movie but it is not for everyone. This is the type of comedy where if you offend easy I would avoid it. Like most movies by Apatow or Rudd the dialog is so great that you find it hard not to laugh at the lines or the delivery of them. The cast is great in this and everyone adds their own brand of comedy but at the same time no one really gets in the way of the others. Just as a heads up though there is a lot of full frontal male nudity in this, but its really funny when it happens. I laughed threw the entire movie and there are a ton of quotable lines in this, but this is not a movie I would buy. Overall, a very funny movie that fans of Apatow will love. I give it a B+.",

      "reviewBody": "The first time I saw Twins Effect, I was stunned. I bought it because the case (lovingly Pirated in China) was a picture of Jackie Chan and one of my favorite pop duos Twins.  I thought I had to see it. I didn&apos;t know whether to love it or hate it. The character development is slow, but quite interesting.  You really have to love the personality that each of the girls brings in.\n\nGypsy (Ah-Jiao) Really makes her mark as a possible action or drama hero. Her acting is very skillful, and thankfully not over-done. Helen (Ah-Sa) also brings charm to the screen but more in a quite concious over-acting (Which though sometimes annoying, is also quite endearing).\n\nThe Vampires are scary, funny and different at the same time.  The film pulls elements from Buffy the Vampire slayer, as well as kind of a euro-coolness for the Vamps.  It is a crazy mix and doesn&apos;t exactly pull me into the film, but it pushes the plot through and, though not convincing, they are fun.\n\nObviously some of the draw to the movie is the great ensemble cast which includes several Hong Kong stars and starlets.  Jackie Chan and Karen Mok bring some of the funniest and most endearing scenes in the movie. Karen, as a booze-loving bride steals the scene in her short cameo.\n\nAction, Romance, Vampires, and cool stunts really make this a good all around movie.  It can be a date movie, or an action flick, or just a fun mindless movie.  In the beginning I said that when I saw it I didn&apos;t know whether to love it or hate it.  Well, now I&apos;ve seen it about 12 times and I love it more with each viewing.  My recommendation is give it a chance, you may like it.\n\nBY the way the opening song done by Jackie and Twins is really cool, if you want to hear it with the vocals look it up: The song&apos;s name is &quot;Bian Bian Bian&quot;  It really is a good piece of HK Pop.\n\nI give this movie an 8 out of 10"

The title is so intriguing that I find myself putting it into all of the scripts I write. The film it&apos;s self pretty much sucks and has no connectedness. It feels as if it has never been edited properly. Here are my thoughts on this film&apos;s integrity 1. The lighting is good for a film that is obviosly very cheap 2. The actors all look like hicks and thus gives reality to the piece 3. The most awesome part of this movie is that there is a character by the name of Jim Carry who goes missing and following this throughout the whole film character will repeat where&apos;s Jim Carry and it&apos;s funnier now since their is a famous actor by that name. This said the movie is pretty crappy aside from that one recurring joke thats not even really a joke. I say avoid unless you like crap like I do!",

The actress that most might know from Almanya, shows that she can do much more than comedy. It&apos;s a tour or a ride or whatever you want to call it. And while she was able to shine in an ensemble movie too (&quot;3 Zimmer, Küche Bad&quot;), this is her baby right here (no pun intended).\n\nAnimal lovers might have an issue here and there, but the movie is defined by other things of course. Relationships between friends and strangers get explored, an interesting look into human psyche and how deep and far things can be taken. A philosophical aspect can be attached to the movie too. There is a reason for that title. If I were to judge just the performance it would&apos;ve been at least a 9/10, but the movie itself leaves a few things/strands without resolution (which is life like and had to be done running time wise I&apos;m sure), some decisions seem far stretched too. Still the ending almost makes up for all the (little) flaws.",

He hooks back up with his friends - loser gangbanger Doughboy and athletic college hopeful Rick.  Tre finds that the hood is full of traps for the young men therein and must decide how he wants to live his life with guidance and hindrance from his father and his friends.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to remember now, but this film was the one that created a series of copies and spoofs, some of which were better or more hard hitting, but they all suffered because they held to cliches that this film created. I.e. the babyfather trap, the college kid having his dreams crushed etc.  The plot now suffers because we know it is all a cliché - but with fresh eyes it is powerful and realistic for many.  Singleton may be a flash in the pan but this was his flash and he directs well - only occasionally going OTT dramatically with slowmo etc.\n\nThe young cast are all very good.  Gooding Jr delivers a good, if naïve performance and Ice Cube proves that not all rappers have to be rubbish actors in poor `comedies&apos;.  Fishburne is as powerful as ever in a small role but Angela Bassett has little to do with her small role.  Long is one of my favourite actresses and she&apos;s really good here.  Many of the cast do fall into caricatures but it&apos;s best to ignore that as much as you can.\n\nOverall a great film that suffers now because it has been copied so much that it looks like a cliché itself.  However with fresh eyes this is a powerful film with only a few weaknesses."

The plot is easy to follow with several surprising and shocking moments that let you peak in how far things can go.\n\nHowever, having said all that, I felt a topic such as this has much more potential to study in more depth than those Glinski shows on screen.\n\nWhen compared to Lilja-4ever, a film which is one of those films that you will never forget and one of the best ones I&apos;ve seen on the subject, Swinki is a only a nicely told tale with a good structure that is somehow afraid to dig deeper and show more layers to this horrible issue happening in our world every single day.",

One woman (Mary Murray) who ran away is brought back by her father (Peter Mullan), who beats her up in front of the women in the dormitory. Her hair is then cut off by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) in an attempt to further degrade her. In another instance, the three new arrivals along with others are forced to stand naked in front of a nun who ridicules their body parts. Crispina (Eileen Walsh) is sexually abused by a priest.\n\nThe Catholic Church has never apologized for the horrendous and inhumane treatment of over 10,000 girls that were imprisoned in these asylums over a period of 70 years, ending as recently as 1996. To this day, various Christian, Jewish and Islamic fundamentalists continue to subjugate women on account of their fear and hatred of female sexuality and freedom.",

I like how this movie doesn&apos;t paint this situation in black and white though. It shows how hard it is to survive in Japanese society, even if you are just guilty by (family) association with a criminal. But it also explains the reasons behind that mentality from, you could say, an evolutionary perspective. While this might not fit the current liberal Zeitgeist, it still makes sense. Some little things that happen storywise are a bit far fetched, but all in all it&apos;s a very enjoyable film with likeable characters.",

Cargo cults are common on a number of islands in Melanesia (e.g., Worsley, P. &quot;Cargo Cults of Melanesia.&quot; Scientific American. 1 May 1959. Search for this online to see the article, since url&apos;s are not permitted in reviews.)\n\nCargo cults have existed for over 150 years. They all are similar in that they anticipate the return of some American(s) bringing &quot;cargo&quot; (desired riches), commonly in association with someone named &quot;John Frum&quot; (= John from...) who will bring the &quot;cargo&quot;. Many cargo cults have traditionally believed that when the cargo comes, blacks will be turned into whites and vice versa. The idea that the US Navy would be sending someone-- today -- to Tanna to search for a lost WW2 airman named John Frum is absurd, and makes fools of both the islanders and the audience. Fortunately, the interesting video and comments of the islanders outweigh the dumb narration/ storyline.",

And unlike Miyazaki&apos;s works and the suggestive speculation from its title, this movie sticks closer to reality (save for the parallel fantasies of a totally different time era) and is not too overdone.\n\nIt is a nice reminder of Ohomide poro poro, one of my favourite anime of all time."

      "reviewBody": "This movie came out four months after &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; with Betty Hutton. Anne Baxter plays a female sharpshooter role quite similar Annie. It suggests that if Betty Hutton had not been available, Anne Baxter would have been an excellent second choice for Annie. While the movie isn&apos;t quite as good as Annie, it is a totally entertaining piece shot in gorgeous Technicolor. If 1950 hadn&apos;t been a year filled with great movies like &quot;Sunset Boulevard,&quot; All About Eve&quot; (with two terrific performances by Ms. Baxter and Betty Davis), &quot;Samson and Delilah,&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Annie Get Your Gun,&quot; it is possible that this one would have picked up at least a few nominations. \n\nDan Dailey has never been better. He is totally relaxed and charming in his role as a salesman of &quot;mustache cups,&quot; and subscriptions to the Saturday Evening Post. Anne Baxter plays her Annie type character with surprising ease and coolness. She seems totally natural when she takes the badge and town sheriff role from her wounded grandfather (wonderfully played by character actor Will Wright who appeared on over 60 television shows in the 1950s and early 60s).\n\nRory Calhoun looks much younger and far handsomer than he was starring in &quot;The Texan&quot; a decade later. This was the first of three movies he was in with Marilyn Monroe. This is Marilyn&apos;s debut film, unfortunately she&apos;s only in it for about five minute. It is also Western star Jack Elam&apos;s debut. Look quick, he&apos;s in it for less than minute. You can also catch Victor Sen Yung (Hop Sing on the 1960&apos;s Western &quot;Bonanza&quot;). Walter Brennan also has two or three nice small scenes. \n\nIf you&apos;re a &quot;Maverick&quot; television fan, this is a must see. While not the first comedy Western, this movie is probably closer to &quot;Maverick&quot; in tone and style than any other movie. Its even closer than James Stewart&apos;s &quot;Destry Rides Again.&quot; \n\nDailey and Baxter giving great performances is the reason to watch, but the Technicolor, beautiful Colorado scenery, and bit parts by future stars is a lot of icing on this sweet little cake of a movie.",

As an exercise in deconstruction (or audience manipulation), COMMENT CA VA is hypnotic, offering a voice-over debate revolving around the effect of images upon a viewer, which is brought to life by contrasting (against the voice-over) white noise, long close-ups of a woman typing (not a man&apos;s fingers, as the woman is cast in a secretarial position even as a discourse questioning the kind of social structures that would include sexism or stereotypes plays out in the background, thus challenging the sexual politics of the intellectual milieu that such a debate would be the product of), and montages of static images of riot-and-strike scenes, which focus the discussion of how the expressions and gestures of the individuals in the captured images manipulate an audience that arrives with preconceptions and expectations that can be slotted into existing ways of viewing the world.\n\nIntellectually and philosophically this is fascinating, and descendants of this interrogation of images and their power as signifiers can be found in the work more recent directors as diverse as Tsai Ming-liang, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Spike Jones and Todd Haynes. But in this earlier presentation, Godard drops the fun factor to zero, creating a film that is provocative, and weirdly haunting, but very, very didactic. For die-hard fans (or theory geeks) only.",

      "reviewBody": "George Sluizer&apos;s salvaged 1993 desert thriller Dark Blood is an uneasy but captivating watch. More than anything its a tantalising final glimpse into the talent of star River Phoenix, surly one of the most promising actors the world has ever seen. \n\nRivers tragic and sudden death in the winter of 93 halted production and left the film missing many of its most crucial and inmate scenes. To overcome this director Sluizer can be heard reading the script amongst a mixture of stills and short clips. This method, whilst effective, is quite jarring and ultimately strange mainly due to Sluizers heavily accented, matter of fact voice which clash with the very intimate words and actions he is trying to get across. \n\nHowever we do get long periods where the film plays uninterrupted, its in these moments we get a sense of what a great movie this may have been. At times a classic Hollywood thriller and others a disturbing art house flick.\n\nPryce and Judy Davis are pretty much note perfect as the bickering Hollywood couple. Pryce plays his character so well I would not be surprised if the role was written with him in mind.\n\nIts no secret that Judy Davis was a very difficult actress to work with not only for the director but also the actors. River in particular was targeted with many friends reporting he would call them in tears due to her hostile treatment towards him. Such was his misery that he personally asked Sluizer to delay the most intimate scenes between them till the last days of shooting (they were never completed). It is to both actors immense credit that this difficult working relationship never comes across on screen, the scenes between them burn with desire and feeling.\n\nIts impossible to talk about this film without really talking about River, even as you are watching the film, the tragedy that was to come is always there, playing on your mind. At only 23 River Phoenix was an Oscar nominated actor of incredible talent, grace and beauty. With the character of &quot;Boy&quot; he was able to display a side of him we had never seen before. He is terrifying, disturbing and dangerous but even in the throes of this madness that trademark sensitivity of Rivers shines through. He was a very special and incredibly gifted actor, and this film like all his prior performances have done before it, bear tribute to that.",

Ali Larter looks fantastic, and the locations are nice even if the time-lapse scenery jumps get a little tiresome by movie&apos;s end.\n\nWorth a look for fans of the genre, but by no means the soft-core porn flick some posts here (and the title - I wish!) suggest. Well, one scene, and no, it features neither Gershon nor Larter.",

I have already read the novel several times, but I still thought that the movie perspective might be helpful.  Needless to say I was wrong.  The movie turns a book about the futility of the individual&apos;s role in war into a boiler plate feel good war movie w/ a happy ending. One of the most important parts of the novel, where Hearn is betrayed despite his best efforts to be a &quot;good&quot; leader, is scrapped.  Hearn not only survives, but the movie goes on the kill the ass hole, Sgt Croft.  In the book we see a group of individuals who all want to singlehandedly make a difference and who all end up failing because modern war has grown beyond the control of the individual.  In the movie we see a division of good guys and bad guys where where good guys win and the bad guys get what&apos;s coming. Finally I would like to point out that this movie is a waste of time or unpleasant to watch.  If its going to be on TV by all means watch it, but if you&apos;ve read the book brace yourself to be VERY disappointed.",

A thing that turned out to be a mistake on my behalf, because this really is a good movie. And of course it would be very unlikely not to be good with Andy Lau in the leading part.\n\nI bought this movie for two reasons; the first reason was, of course, Andy Lau, and the second reason being that this is a Chinese martial arts drama.\n\n&quot;Shaolin&quot; also has a small role for martial arts legend Jackie Chan, and even in a supporting small role he shines, and really did add his usual charms and charisma to the movie.\n\nI enjoyed &quot;Shaolin&quot; quite a lot and was genuinely surprised at captivating the story was and how good director Benny Chan is at telling a story to the audience.\n\nIf you enjoy Asian cinema then you most definitely should take the time to watch &quot;Shaolin&quot;.

This film is truly a product of its time in that there are open displays of affection and the young ladies wear miniskirts. This was the first film with the very pretty Jacki Piper, buts its the ensemble aspect of this film which makes it work. Its a sex comedy without the nudity. Its fun and enjoyable.",

      "reviewBody": "This story deals with an American hit-man (Nicolas Cage, also producer) in Thailand , he kills his victims with no remorse . The drug addict murderer forms a relationship with a young man (pleasant Shahkrit Yamnarm) , as he teaches his craft to Thai hustler . Meanwhile , the killer falls in love with a deaf-mute (in the first version this handicap is borne by the murderous) pharmacist (enjoyable Charlie Young) and he shares brief moments of happiness .\n\nThis detailed study about an assassin and a youth he trains is an exciting movie with a great visual style . It concerns about murders , vengeance , a love story and this one delivers it well . The picture reworks many familiar issues , as a double-crossed hit-man falling in love . The rate of events blending drama and action are enhanced by extended length of the hunting scenes and occasional flashes of brilliance . There takes place a great deal of killing with some creative moments wrought from heavy stylistics and in a John Woo style . It succeeds in building intrigue , tension and nice performances , thanks to the affecting acting of the girl who plays the deaf and mute , she&apos;s frankly marvelous . The characters are well portrayed and they are persons for who the viewer has feeling and compassion . Worth it for the terse script and twists ending .\n\nFurthermore , colorful and granulated cinematography by Decha Srimantra , Pang brothers&apos; usual . Atmospheric musical score fitting well to action by Brian Tyler (author of notorious soundtracks from Rambo 4, Constantine , War , among others). The motion picture is professionally directed by Pang brothers (Messengers , Re-cycle , The eye), shooting during Thailand coup d&apos;etat . Directors , Danny and Oxide Chun Pang did a cool but uneven work in making this violent story .",

The special effects were excellent, with quite a few &quot;oh $#!@&quot; moments.\n\nBe warned: If Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, then I don&apos;t recommend Cloverfield. The *entire* movie is filmed in the &quot;handy-cam&quot; style of the trailer - but in my opinion, it works better here than in Blair Witch. It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.\n\nVery intense film.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes it feels like a disadvantage to watch as many movies as I do, and as huge a variety. I&apos;ve watched revered jidaigeki classics from the likes of Kurosawa Akira and Kobayashi Masaki; I&apos;ve watched middling U. S. action flicks and B-movies, including some that to one degree or another play loosely and indifferently with aesthetics lifted from Japan or China. Maybe it has something to do with the production having filmed in Canada, and I double and triple-checked to try to be sure that I wasn&apos;t missing some crucial detail - but in watching this 1990 period piece, frankly I discern as many similarities with the latter as with the former. There is a jarring discrepancy between those facets that unquestionably reflect earnest mindful care, and those that seem to have received the benefit of notably less attention or resources. The sum total is still enjoyable in some measure, but there&apos;s a clash of styles and quality throughout the whole runtime that makes me feel as if I were watching two different versions of the same film smashed together into one. It&apos;s kind of unpleasant and uncomfortable, and not in a manner that has anything to do with the ugliness of war as depicted herein. I&apos;m glad that I watched, but how much is that really saying?\n\nThe foremost visuals and ardor of the production unmistakably belong to the cinema of filmmaker Kadokawa Haruki and his countrymen, and there was seemingly no expense spared. Epic battle scenes are rendered with countless horses and extras, thousands of props, weapons, and suits of armor, and the magnificence of enormous battlefields. The stunts, effects, choreography, and otherwise action sequences are outstanding and invigorating, and one wishes that we saw still more of them. This is to say nothing, broadly, of the terrific production design and art direction. The sets are utterly fantastic, and likewise the costume design, hair, and makeup. The filming locations are plainly gorgeous. At its best Kadokawa&apos;s direction is impeccable in orchestrating shots and scenes, and the cinematography is unfailingly smart, whether we&apos;re watching stark violence unfold or a quiet scene of dialogue between two characters. &apos;Heaven and Earth&apos; is beautifully shot, and it&apos;s a sight for sore eyes that in its fundamental presentation fits right in with esteemed classics like Kurosawa&apos;s epics &apos;Ran,&apos; or &apos;Kagemusha.&apos;\n\nOn the other hand, this Japanese picture, that was filmed in the Japanese language, includes narration in English from a man whose timbre recalls Peter Falk narrating &apos;The Princess Bride,&apos; but with a less sincere diction. The music is defined largely by so-so MIDI themes produced on a keyboard that would feel more at home in a low-grade sci-fi flick, or maybe a PC videogame from the early to mid-90s, and the drama and thrills are sadly undercut to a considerable extent. The editing and sequencing come off as a little brusque and sometimes sloppy, a far cry from the meticulous craftsmanship we expect based on jidaigeki from the previous several decades. Even if we make allowances for weak translation in subtitles to convey information in a different language, every now and again the dialogue comes off as weirdly oversimplified and dull, and the same verbiage could be applied to the scene writing. Actually, I&apos;m not so impressed with the screenplay at all; Kadokawa, Kamata Toshio, Keynji Chogoro, and Yoshiwara Isao give us a feature that majorly emphasizes its battles, and the otherwise grandeur of the visuals, while oddly skimping on the plot that provides context for what we&apos;re watching. Case in point, Usami is treated so lightly in the script that his actions relative to Kagetora pretty much seem to come out of nowhere, and there is absolutely no weight behind what happens between the two men. In another example, a supporting character that is important to a primary one dies off-screen, but since they were barely part of the tale to begin with, their loss means nothing to the audience. The story requires these events to transpire, and so they do, but the incidence holds no water.\n\nFurther complicating matters, though Kadokawa arranges scenes in general, battle scenes particularly, and wide, sweeping vistas with a mind for that visual splendor, in the smaller, more specific instances of guiding his cast and informing the camerawork, to be honest his work comes across as halfhearted and middling. The final scene between Usami and Kagetora is executed with sloth and apparent hesitance that has nothing to do with the emotions the figures may be feeling and everything to do with how actors Enoki Takaaki and Watase Tsunehiko are moving and expressing themselves. Later, as the camera slowly revolves around Enoki in a somber moment, it is with a speed that undercuts the drama of the beat. The action sequences are truly phenomenal, and the overall excellence of the the sights to greet us no less so in a production that was accordingly massively expensive by any prior standards of the Japanese industry. So why does it seem as if the title was shortchanged with regards to the minutiae that help to bring the best value to bear? Did those involved have a very limited skill set that resulted in this dichotomy? Was the budget so pointedly devoted to the battles and visuals that all other elements were bereft, and the contributors had to make do? In one fashion or another, there are two halves that comprise the whole that is &apos;Heaven and Earth,&apos; and they are not equal, identical halves.\n\nFor what it does well I want to like this far, far more than I do; I cannot overstate how superb the battle sequences are, likely among the very, very best that have ever been produced in the medium. For where it strangely falls short, sacrificing other key aspects to hyper-focus on the battles and visuals, I&apos;m aghast, and flummoxed. The disparity is glaring, and the movie in its entirety is gravely diminished in turn. Had all components been treated with equal skill, intelligence, and care, &apos;Heaven and Earth&apos; would surely be hailed as one of the greatest pictures ever made; having not received the benefit of labor applied equally across the board, my favor drops precipitously. For as great as those battles and visuals are, it&apos;s not as if we can&apos;t get similar ardor elsewhere. The number of reasons there are to watch this instead of anything else are few. I do like this feature, but I also can&apos;t help wondering if I&apos;m being to kind in my assessment. Do check it out, by all means, and for the especial parts that I&apos;ve noted - but be well aware that &apos;Heaven and Earth&apos; is a title split in two, and it is in turn both stupendous and tiresome.",

But the story just kept getting in the way.\n\nThat&apos;s why &quot;When Nature Calls&quot;, in my opinion, is much funnier.\n\nThe story of securing a sacred bat is neither too intrusive nor annoying and leaves room for gags aplenty.  \n\nAnd Carrey....  Well, he enters a slapstick marathon and wins the gold in every event.  I swear the man is made of rubber.\n\nSome of the jokes are pretty gross (the spitting ritual, the &quot;guano&quot; references, etc.) but why should that come as any surprise?  Most comedies gear for that kind of humor anymore and, more or less sophisticated, reach the same common denominator: body fluids is funny, dude.\n\nStill, without the fluids and functions, there are still great scenes (Ace&apos;s entrance in the dining hall, the monks&apos; reaction to his departure, his behavior at the slide show, his driving habits, his escape from a mechanical rhino) and plenty of opportunities to see Hollywood&apos;s most uninhibited comedian use every conceivable part of his body to make us laugh.\n\nI laughed.  His work is done.\n\nWhen this &quot;Nature&quot; calls, answer it.\n\nNine stars.  And remember: do not pass go, do not collect $200."

Ann Augustine is wooden &amp; could be compared with Arjun Rampal of Bollywood. The rest of the cast is average because they don&apos;t have much to play. Nivin Pauly is amazing in his new role.\n\nThe story is pretty clean with a fat guy aiming high, love &amp; freedom from humility. The story revolved around the thadiyan and his life. Yes, of course, this films talks about hope and how one should stand with one&apos;s capabilities, but at a time when Aashiq Abu has delivered us 22Fk and while we expect more serious cinema, Da Thadiya stands inside the box not to charm much. Rating 6/10.\n\nIntroducing teen Mallu language, Star Wars star-troopers&apos; helmet, flashy songs, dress code or Vespa for that matter won&apos;t work anymore. That phase is just out of trend, right now. But, I appreciate how Abu has taken courage to direct a film with teen faces and yes, he has succeeded in garnering the local Kerala crowd. But, in a broader aspect, DT just fairs average, or maybe a step ahead. That&apos;s all.\n\nNothing new in story, stunts are fake, songs are catchy, performances are amazing, direction is good as well as the screenplay. Watch it for the entertainment, because this is no charmer. And yes, go for it for the brilliant wacky climax; no wonder why people around me howled for that last sequence!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

Louis de Funes (Der GENDARM von St. TROPEZ), Philippe Noiret, Sacha Pitoeff and Jean Rochefort can be seen in additional supporting roles. Love is also not neglected in the form of Genevieve Grad as beautiful Isabelle and Anna Maria Ferrero.\n\nNothing special, but definitely worth seeing for fans of the genre!",

      "reviewBody": "There is a twist to this horror tale; all modern horror films seem to be required to have a story twist. I won&apos;t tell what it is, but I will say careful viewers will have no trouble figuring it out.\n\nA young grad student arrives at a mental institution to begin his internship and from the start notices that the hospital is not up to standard. Patients are not given proper (sometimes not even humane) treatment, doctors and staff seem uninterested, facilities are nearly defunct, and (of course) the place just might be haunted.\n\nThe movement of the film is nice and brisk, with scare scenes coming at a fairly steady pace. The cast is capable and it&apos;s nice to have a couple horror regulars on board (Lance Henrickson and Jordan Ladd). The scripting is also adequate, but lacks punch; most everything seen here can be seen elsewhere. And then there is the twist, which while not a &apos;deal-breaker&apos; will still influence your opinion of the film as a whole.\n\nFor some decent and classical scares this works just fine, just don&apos;t expect anything new or unique.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "Well, here it is folks, I think it&apos;s been long enough since hackers came out (6 years+), so I am going to offer what I think will be the definitive commentary on the film &quot;Hackers.&quot; Simply put, Hackers is the finest movie ever. The music, the costumes, the dialog... if you could put FUN in a box (not to mention Johnny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie) the box would say &quot;Hackers&quot; on it. If this movie were a president, it would Hackraham Lincoln. If it were a gum, it would be Hackalicious... you get the picture.\n\nAnyhow, the really important thing I have to say is this:\n\nA.) Hackers is NOT a &quot;B-movie&quot;; the budget was large and the actors have major talent; it&apos;s a slick production, and it shows.\n\nB.) Contrary to the belief of some cyber-dorks out there (who mainly get their jollies by pretending they know more than other people about computers) it doesn&apos;t matter if the computer interface is somewhat unrealistic. Obviously, there are some classic &quot;movie&quot; style computer screens (a la 1995&apos;s other horrible computer flick &quot;The Net (of crap)&quot;), but lest I seem like a broken record, I will repeat for the entertainmentally challenged THIS IS A MOVIE!\n\nC.) Are you kidding me? This stuff is great! I can watch this movie forever (and believe me, I have) and NEVER EVER get tired of it. C&apos;mon, this stuff is just classic, listen here to some dialogue:\n\n(spoken with much gusto:) &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s got a killer refresh rate.&quot;\n\n&quot;Risc is good.&quot;\n\n&quot;Never fear, I is here.&quot;\n\nIT&apos;S SO CLASSIC IT HURTS!\n\nBottom line, if you wanna be a nerd, go program something. If you want to be entertained, get this movie, NOW!"

      "reviewBody": "Christina Ricci sings more than she speaks in the movie, but she manages to hold your attention nevertheless for a pretty solid hour and a half in this well-acted and profound, but uneven period piece. Sally Potter, who also directed the similarly problematic &quot;Orlando&quot;, clearly has the visual and thematic talent to be a much better respected director than she is - she just needs to learn how to tell a story.\n\nThe first forty minutes of the film, which begins in the year 1927, are absolutely masterful. The sublime Claudia Lander-Duke plays young Fegele, an impoverished Russian-Jewish girl whose beloved father decides to journey to America in search of a better life. After that, Fegele and her family are set upon by unnamed bad guys (probably either Cossacks or Communists), and Fegele is separated from them. She ends up on an ocean liner bound for England, where her name is changed to Susan, she is adopted by an English family that doesn&apos;t understand her, and she is forced to begin the process of assimilation.\n\nFlash forward ten years or so (Potter is regrettably and consistently unspecific about such things). Fegele (now Suzie and now played by Christina Ricci, she of the large, expressive eyes) wants to be a showgirl so she can earn money to go to America and find her father. She auditions and is accepted by a group based out of Paris. Once in Paris, she rooms and becomes tight with fellow showgirl Lola (Cate Blanchett), a somewhat vapid and materialistic creature with no ambition save that of landing a rich man - which she manages to do in the form of opera singer and Mussolini supporter Dante Dominio (John Turturro, in one of his better performances). Around the same time, Suzie meets and falls in love with Cesare (Johnny Depp), the leader of a band of gypsies.\n\nOnce all the dominoes are in place, Potter wastes no time in knocking them down. You can see trouble coming a mile away: Lola, Suzie&apos;s one confidant who is aware of her Jewish ancestry, begins falling under the emotional and political spell of anti-Semitic, gypsy-hating fascist Dante. Meanwhile, the Nazis have invaded Poland and, despite everyone&apos;s self-assured predictions that they&apos;ll stop there, the French border is neither geographically nor historically distant. Suddenly, it&apos;s a race against time for all involved, but especially for Suzie - will she stay behind with her gypsy king, or, given a choice, will she escape certain death? The problem with all of this is that it&apos;s all so familiar. Potter adds nothing to the old story. There are some wonderful messages in this film about multiculturalism, nationalism, and the sometimes subtle nature of fascism, but if you don&apos;t care about the story you&apos;re not going to be interested in listening to the messages. The gypsy subplot, for instance, seems tacked on, like it was an excuse to give Ricci a love interest and have him be played by Johnny Depp.\n\nThe really interesting plot line here involves Lola and Dante, and I would pay ten dollars to see a movie that was just about them. Both Blanchett and Turturro create real, flesh-and-blood human beings, and it&apos;s in their scenes that Potter&apos;s writing really soars. Watching Dante sink deeper and deeper into a political philosophy fueled by his own insecurity while the irrepressibly optimistic Lola tries to turn a blind eye to it all is a fascinating and marvelous experience.\n\nRicci gives a good performance too, although occasionally that Valley Girl tone she uses in most of the rest of her movies slips out a little too much here and there. Fortunately, Potter doesn&apos;t give the shy, quiet Suzie very much to say. Most of her acting is done with her eyes, and she&apos;s really quite good. Johnny Depp does what he can with Cesare, but there&apos;s only so much an actor can accomplish when playing a plot device.\n\nArt direction, music, and cinematography were all top-drawer. As is par for the course with Sally Potter&apos;s films, it looked good and had some interesting things to say. I just wish it had been more compelling."

      "reviewBody": "While &quot;Traffickers&quot; (&quot;Gong-mo-ja-deul&quot;) is not the brightest moment in Korean cinema, it is neither the darkest. This movie is the type of movie that will have to simmer for a little while as it sinks in, because it is a movie that gives you something to think about.\n\nAs such, then &quot;Traffickers&quot; may not appeal to just everyone in the audience, and can be something of an acquired taste.\n\nThe story is about a group of people who deal in illegally obtained organs taken from people against their will, with deadly results.\n\nWhile there are many different layers to the story here, it does seem a little bit out of place, and as if director Hong-seon Kim is trying a little bit too much, and not fully accomplishing what set out for. However, as the movie progress, what previously didn&apos;t make much sense or came off as being strange and out of place, starts to make sense as the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. With a movie that works in this manner, perhaps a second viewing is to be done in order to fully grasp the whole thing.\n\nThe acting in the movie was good, and there was a great flow to the story, although it just didn&apos;t always make much sense at first.\n\nIt should be said that there are some fairly brutal and visually macabre scenes throughout the movie. But for a movie of this caliber and genre, it is a necessity. But be warned, some might find it a bit appalling.\n\n&quot;Traffickers&quot; is enjoyable, although two hours were pushing the boundaries a little bit, and the movie would have fared better with a bit cut out in the editing here and there. And while things portrayed in the movie may or may not actually take place in the world, then &quot;Traffickers&quot; does give something to think about. So if you sit down with the intend to watch this movie on autopilot, you might be better off with something else, perhaps with a movie that doesn&apos;t really require conscious thought.",

After Johannes has fought with his doubts about this &quot;job&quot;, he finally starts reporting about Farid, when he starts dating the girl that Johannes has a crush on. \n\n&quot;Schläfer&quot; is a very typical German movie of 2006. Apart from the highly up to date &quot;terrorist&quot; background, it tells the story in quiet, discreet pictures (except from some party scene), which are very popular at German directors at present (in the beginning you have a 4 minute long steadicamscene without a cut). But it is definitely one of the better movies in this style (not just another Aki Kaurismäki or Jim Jarmush copy). The pictures are partly very fresh and unspent. The story itself is interesting because of its social-political background (we have a huge debate about integration...) but also because of the psychological relationship between the three characters (Power and envy).\n\n&quot;Schläfer&quot; is a modern movie, with complex characters (Bastian Trost is really good) and a story that deals with an issue effecting us all, politically as well as socially. It looks really great, thanks to a solid cinematography-job by Reinhold Vorschneider and the talent of the director Benjamin Heisenberg. But for all that, the fascination that inspires the audience (like &quot;city of god&quot; or &quot;paradise now&quot; is missing. That makes it a 8/10",

As melodrama indicates, it&apos;s drama with music, and from the start Ophuls sets in motion an operistic, artificial mood. Every performance is self-conscious, aware of being representing; all sets are shown thoroughly, characters leave the scene and the camera remains a few seconds in the empty decor; even the way the snows falls from the sky appears to be fake. Still the film has an admirable freshness and engages the audience in an almost hypnotic trip, to which Ophuls&apos; floating camera and his modern, dramatic use of the score contribute big time. Max Ophuls can be paralleled with Douglas Sirk as a director that purposely breaks up with any trace of reality in order to convey a truth that is purely cinematic."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always loved Blake Edwards films and although this may not have been regarded as his best work, I feel it was highly underrated.  Though thoroughly implausible in many ways, I have to say that this movie made me laugh harder than any movie I&apos;ve ever seen.  My sides literally hurt after watching it.  Although I&apos;ve only seen it a few times since it came out because none of the networks other than FX ever show it.  Why I don&apos;t know because it&apos;s really great!!\n\nThe main reason I&apos;d have to say was John Laroquette as Nadia&apos;s psychotic ex-boyfriend.  I was cracking up in every single scene he was in with his standard line (I&apos;ll kill you).  His physical comedy is totally brilliant. I don&apos;t know why he didn&apos;t end up with a film career of his own.  But my favorite scene has to be at the end when Nadia sees David hanging from the balcony of the house and squeals as they both dive into the pool and meet at the bottom in a kiss as they come up for air, with David yelling; &quot;Nadia, get your mouth off of him&quot;!!\n\nThe movie is flawed in places though.  What are the odds that a house moving company would be moving a house at the exact moment that Nadia decides to knock on the door.  And it is never explained why Walter is facing 2 years in prison for his night on the town, yet David completely escapes any legal obligations for plowing his car into 3 seperate businesses.\n\nKim Basinger and Bruce Willis were great as well.  Though I didn&apos;t understand why they dyed her gorgeous blonde hair brown.  Maybe because her image was supposed to be that of a sweet girl looking for love and Edwards thought she&apos;d look too much the vamp and would lack credibility without the dye job.  It&apos;s also a good chance to see the late Phil Hartman early in his career.  I also loved the love song played at the end by Gary Morris and Jennifer Warnes.\n\nAll in all, a fun ride from beginning to end.  If you haven&apos;t seen it yet, go out and rent it now.  You won&apos;t be disapointed, it&apos;s a 10+++!"

      "name": "tricked into seeing this, and it was... not bad, not very good, just &quot;decent&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "A Better Tomorrow - for some of us cinephiles the film&apos;s name brings to mind images of guys (i.e. Chow Yun-Fat in his break-out role and performance that made him a star in Hong Kong) in trench-coats and ray-ban sunglasses with big friggin guns firing away in blazing battles staged with a balletic precision and melodramatic (or just operatic) sleight of hand by John Woo. It was a classic unto itself, if not as polished as The Killer or as crazy as Hard Boiled with just as much (or more) genuine heart to its dramatic acting and story. So surprised I was then to see that my local cineplex- which often gets Asian films to cater to the the nearby town that is predominantly Korean- that &apos;A Better Tomorrow&apos; would be coming to that theater for a two-week run. What better way to see Woo&apos;s film, I thought, than on a big screen like one of the ones at my local theater. I was even told (perhaps misleadingly to buy a ticket and/or concessions) that it was the 80&apos;s Woo film, albeit &quot;Korean&quot;. Hmm, I thought, is it Korean? I thought it was from HK, like Woo&apos;s films usually are, but maybe it&apos;s dubbed in Korean for the community... hmm...\n\nAnd no, lo and behold, it was really a remake (I can tell this as not an accident as Woo himself is credited here as exec producer). I decided to let the movie speak for itself; maybe someone would riff of of Woo&apos;s film while putting his own distinct take on the material. Suffice to say it&apos;s not anything to write home about. It takes the ingredients of the original story- a tale of brothers and betrayal, cops and gangsters, and a showdown at a big dock/shipping yard (that last part was the one thing that really stuck out most among set- pieces, and it&apos;s recreated here)- and just makes it... ordinary. It&apos;s a thriller that has a few decent performances (I couldn&apos;t tell you exactly who as I left before the credits rolled, albeit the main gangster villain reminded me of the villain from Oldboy, and it&apos;s that&apos;s the case then very good work there by a proved guy). It has a few flashy-violent scenes. Most memorable for me some time after the movie&apos;s end is when a character, after shooting up a massage parlor loaded with bad guys and with only a minor wound in his shoulder, walks away with sunglasses on, trench-coat on, and is trying to look super-cool... and then gets shot through the knee and his cool is taken down a peg.\n\nBut there&apos;s not really much to invest in any one character, and no actor here is like a Chow Yun-Fat or even a Ti-Lung, who were two major assets to the success of Woo&apos;s film as real actors with real star appeal. The guys here are workmanlike, easy to see how they go through the motions, and the director mostly lets the music (which even for an Asian crime movie) go way over the top to try to direct emotion from the audience when what&apos;s there should be enough, very stock stuff. If one has never seen the original Woo film, I could imagine some perfunctory enjoyment coming from the material, but the problem I had (and perhaps this is somewhat my fault and happens sometimes with Korean movies) was I couldn&apos;t keep track of some of the principle characters. I lost track of who was who in the first half hour of the movie, and had to be reminded when a character said someone&apos;s name. It finally got into a good groove once it flashed forward to three years later, and a character with a particular limp is distinctive. But the story doesn&apos;t always feel very closely knit together. \n\nThere&apos;s nothing in it that is so offensive as to want to leave the theater. There&apos;s also nothing that grabs me in and makes me rush out to tell friends who would perk up at a solid HK or Korean or whatever crime movie with big emotions and bigger gun battles. I can&apos;t really speak to the director&apos;s past work to draw upon comparison- one film by Hae-sung Song, Failan, is unavailable in the US though touted by reviewers on IMDb- but he doesn&apos;t push the material into anything very interesting. It might be commendable that the film doesn&apos;t slavishly imitate the original film, but then what else is there? Just general competency? A few cool looking characters in a gun battle or some tears shed at just the right flash of the cut of film? A Better Tomorrow 2010 most depressingly does what a good many American remakes do: takes the core ingredients, gives it a 21st century sheen... and it&apos;s generally just dull.",

It&apos;s mostly interviews, luckily the interviewed are all influential people in the world of music. Some of the interviewed talk kind of slow (probably stoned?). I guess you got to be interested in dub/reggae or at least in making music.\n\nAnyhow the musically not-knowing people must be educated, so show &apos;em this documentary.

      "reviewBody": "Short Circuit is a rare case when a robot character makes a film and outshines the rest of the cast in the film.\n\nA military organization that builds weapons known as Nova creates five robots. One of the robots, Number Five, is hit by lightning and as a result is able to become &quot;alive&quot;. He escapes from Nova and befriends a woman named Stephanie and begins to gain a lot of &quot;input&quot; and learns a lot. Nova plans on capturing him, but Number Five realizes that he must not get captured in order to remain alive.\n\nFirst off I have to say that this film is a comedy and much of it should not be taken seriously. By that I mean that the depiction of the military group of Nova constantly bickering and having lame discussions is something that film intended on doing.\n\nThe acting and human characters are pretty odd in this film. I can see why Steve Guttenberg is constantly criticized by viewers. He is just a boring not funny guy who makes robots in this film. Ally Sheed plays Stephanie, a really naive and not that intelligent veterinarian. Also the character of Ben being a Caucasian who speaks like an Indian Person is something that I think is pretty funny, if not a bit racist as well. But for the most part the human characters are not special at all and completely overshadowed.\n\nThey attempt to make a love story with Guttenberg and Sheed&apos;s character. However it comes off as rushed and horrible and I did not buy it. If anything the romance with Number five and Stephanie is much more convincable.\n\nThe reason for this film being good is Number Five. Number Five is one of the greatest robot characters ever in a film. Hilarious, intelligent, and highly entertaining. He can do anything. It is quite interesting seeing him gain input and learn a lot about the world. It is not common for a robot to steal the show and make a movie good just by itself, but this is one case where that happens and the film is good because of it.\n\nQuite an interesting film. Lame acting and human characters. However a great character in Number Five. I recommend this film to viewers because of Number Five.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a cartoon movie that I saw a few times when I was a little kid, a story about the Evil Queen casting a snowstorm across the village in attempts to freeze Snow White. However, Snow White escapes, but not before seeing her parents turned unto ice.\n\nThis is an exciting little movie that is full of adventures, fun for the kids and entertaining for adults as well. While the fairytale of Snow White has been adapted many times, it&apos;s nice to see a new chapter to the story that is treated with innocent fun but suspenseful thrills. You get to see Snow White try to get away from the Evil Queen in new ways and, instead of the Seven Dwarfs, she meets the Seven Giants. They try to help Snow White deal with the Evil Queen and save her village. \n\nWith bright animation and colorful characters, it&apos;s a fine movie for the whole family, but more for the kids.\n\nGrade B",

      "reviewBody": "Greenland, with its rich culture(and this goes into both positives and negatives of it, when something like this often ignores one altogether), fascinating language and warm-hearted people. No prior knowledge of any of those are necessary to appreciate this - most of it can be inferred(the level of detail is immense, with almost nothing having to be explained to the audience, as this requires the plot take a break). Eva(Villaume, sweet, she doesn&apos;t put up with any crap) travels there to meet her fiancée, only to find that he&apos;s with someone else. She stays with Jens(Reichhardt, lonely and business-like), both of them hoping that the next boat home comes as soon as possible. At the same time, the relationship between the natives Pavia and Naja thrives. But maybe things will change...\n\nThe clever approach to this setting(which makes for amazing, scenic shots) is to weave it into a traditional Western story. A primitive society is quite different from a so-called civilized one, so this tells one plot from each, parallel to each other. Balling was an impeccable director even at this point - the characters are all credible, both genders are strong and the development is so invisibly organic. All of the acting is great, there isn&apos;t a poor performance to be found, regardless of age or ethnicity. Dialog, music, script, all of it rather well-done. The title translates to &quot;peak wanderer&quot;, which is what a man who has suffered great shame may become... one who walks into the hostile nature, to certain death. This comes with subtitles in either of the spoken languages, although we Danes can follow it without any.\n\nThere is some disturbing and bloody content in this. The DVD comes with a 7 minute interview with the cameraman, 3 minute restoration examples and trailers for De Frigjorte, Det Store Flip and this. I recommend this to any fan of drama and/or romance, as well as anyone interested in the island. 8/10",

Complicating matters is the volatility of a local tribe after its chief dies, leaving the sons (Ed and Rafer Johnson) to battle for succession.\n\nStrictly formula Tarzan fare with all the usual motifs (pet leopard, a pair of chimps et al) blends some nice scenery with watchable action scenes. Henry is not as relaxed in his role as Ron Ely (the TV Tarzan), but does the business well enough to be convincing. Lacks intensity (the scene where Gur &amp; Gans are attacked by the megalomaniacal brother Ngambi ends rather abruptly), although enough of the cast end up skewered on spears that it&apos;s perhaps too violent for the pre-adolescents.\n\nIf you&apos;re into Tarzan, and especially if you grew up on Ely&apos;s TV rendition, then this instalment should satisfy a Sunday afternoon."

      "reviewBody": "The Hurricane is a terrific but overlooked film from 1937, often thought of as a tepid &quot;island romance,&quot; but in actuality a solid dramatic film (directed by John Ford) with great special effects and music by Alfred Newman.\n\nDorothy Lamour and Jon Hall play the leads, Pacific Islanders who get caught in French provincial law and governance, as applied by strict governor Raymond Massey. Despite sympathetic tendencies of others Hall is convicted of striking a white man and imprisoned in Tahiti-600 miles away. He escapes in time for the &quot;big blow&quot; that seems to his the island in retaliation for the white man&apos;s laws.\n\nLamour is quite good as the island beauty, and Hall brings more to his role than the usual &quot;hunk&quot; attitudes and poses. Massey is solid as the taciturn governor who finally sees the light. Mary Astor is good as always as the governor&apos;s wife. Thomas Mitchell is the drunken doctor. Jerome Cowan is the ship captain. John Carradine is the sadistic guard. Spencer Charters is the inept judge. Inez Courtney is the girl on the ship. And best of all is the regal C. Aubrey Smith as the island priest.\n\nThe hurricane is awesome and the special effects among the best of the decade. The scenes of Astor crawling along a rope to find refuge in a tree and windblown Smith playing the organ as the church roof blows away are great. The destruction of the island is totally convincing and becomes almost mythic as a natural force to wipe out man&apos;s inhumanity. \n\nGreat film and very underrated."

The jokes, the acting and the overall behavior of the people in this movie is exaggerated, ridiculous and not funny at all. I do not see the point in making a sequel to a movie that was released in 1980, because the first movie was exactly the same; stupid exaggerated non-funny jokes and acting. So I say this to all of you who saw the first movie in theaters, watch this if you want, but you&apos;re gonna get disappointed. This movie may have it&apos;s moments, but there&apos;s not many of &apos;em.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a film that can be viewed on two levels.\n\nThe first level is that of a straightforward black comedy. Five liberal students, who think they have the answers to all the world&apos;s ills, have their comfortable world invaded by a redneck racist who is invited in for supper after coming to the aid of one of the students when he has car trouble. Naturally there is a clash of politics and, after a violent argument, the racist is accidentally killed. They decide to bury him in their garden instead of reporting the killing. What follows is a continuation of an earlier debate they had been having; would people be justified in murdering someone if they knew he was evil? Their answer is yes, and soon they are inviting other rightwingers for an evening of dinner, debate and death. On the first level the film is okay.\n\nIt is on the second, more cerebral level, that the film really succeeds. The great irony is that the liberals become intolerant, revealing the dangers of political correctness and the very real possibility of a left-wing police state in which alternative views are crushed in the name liberal values.\n\nA good soundtrack, some sparkling cameos by the dinner guests, and a knockout performance by Ron Perlman as the conservative commentator make this largely overlooked comedy well worth a gander."

Both Rondo Hatton as the psycho killer and Martin Kosleck as an artist driven to madness by unkind critics are villains, yet both are sympathetic in a way. What is especially touching is Kosleck&apos;s interaction with his pet cat and the closing scene where the cat curls up by his dead body. (Or did he die? The dialogue isn&apos;t clear on it.) It was effective and sorrowful.\n\nMy sole complaint is the woefully brief appearance of Virginia Christine as Creeper&apos;s first victim. I hardly had a chance to recognize her before she was offed. I always enjoy her early film appearances because she was an out and out fox. I would so much have enjoyed seeing her as the tennis model instead. Hubba-hubba!",

Be warned, if you prefer r&apos;n&apos;b over Mozart and Schubert you will have hard time watching this. And maybe that guy is right, the director doesn&apos;t know &quot;the life&quot;.

      "reviewBody": "TLTH is a solid war movie made in a time devoid of Tom Cruises, Di Crapios and other mattodamonic Bennaffleckians. Caine and Robertson look like men, not wimpy little effeminate preppies which we&apos;re served and rammed down our throats en masse nowadays. Michael Caine participated in the Korean war as a soldier, while Denholm Elliot spent several years as a Japanese P.O.W. in WW II; what&apos;s the toughest ordeal Casey Affleck ever had to go through? A broken nail? And it partially shows on screen, of course.\n\nThe main drawback is the length; I saw no reason for this plot to use up over 2 hours of screen time. A minor problem was the occasional mumbling.\n\nOne of the things I liked here is that there was a more realistic way of looking at World War II. In recent decades we&apos;ve had U.S. liberals and other clueless Leftists tell us how &quot;valid&quot; and &quot;noble&quot; that war was, as opposed to other wars that came later, that were supposedly totally immoral, unclean, nasty and vile. However, there is no such thing as a &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;sanitized&quot; war. The lack of discipline, morality and even courage among some of the British troops in this film is a refreshing break from the kind of silly over-glorification of WW II - especially the way this stands in contrast to the over-vilification of wars fought by America in the decades after that.\n\nJudging by Caine&apos;s memories (from his autobiography) related to filming TLTH, a documentary on the making of the film would have been fascinating to watch."

      "reviewBody": "This movie is deceptive--a casual viewing could discard it as another &quot;feel good&quot; film from Europe. \n\nIt permeates Christian values without sermons, priests, or any religious hard sell (a small poster of Christ in a booth of the Salvation Army is an exception). Philosophically, it presents Tabula Rasa or a clean slate to begin life anew. The film tends to be absurdist (not even a moan emanates from brutalized victims of violence, broken noses are twisted back painlessly, victims of violence emerge from shadows to mete out justice). The film recalls shades of the brilliance of Tomas Alea&apos;s early Cuban films and the humanity of Zoltan Fabri&apos;s Hungarian cinema.   \n\n The film presents entertainment of a kind that would be alien to Hollywood--a cinematic essay on human values that seem to be a rare commodity the world over. There is no sex; there is no need for it. The poor who live in garbage bins and in empty containers, are rich with pockets full of kindness, helping each other without any expectation of a reward. The rich and powerful (the ex-wife and her lover, the policemen, the hospital staff, the official who rents out illegal living space) seem bereft of true feelings or any human kindness. The poorer sections of society (the electrician, the restaurant staff, the family who nurses the main character, the Salvation Army staff) do good to others, care about others and expect nothing in return.\n\nThe film is an affirmation of Christian values without preaching religion. The main female character in love with the man, is ready to sacrifice her love because she genuinely respects marriage vows and even brings a &quot;train&quot; schedule to send off her lover to his wife. The art of giving is sanctified. A man who employed workers believes in paying his workers, even if it meant robbing a bank to do so. A lawyer argues a case well because he likes the Salvation Army. Symbolically, even half a potato among six or eight harvested is given away to some stranger wanting to eat it and avoid scurvy! Again, symbolically there is rain on a clear day to help grow the few potatoes...\n\nThe film provides humour of a quaint, Finnish variety. A timid dog that eats leftover peas is called Hannibal--a male name one can associate with a king or even the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter--even though the dog is female. There are swipes taken against the government and its associated machinery (antiquated laws, North Korean buying Finnish banks, retirement benefits, strikes and strikers, bank staff, corrupt banking practices).\n\n Trains play a crucial role in Kaurismaki&apos;s screenplay. It begins and ends the film. It also punctuates the film, when the past is revealed, briefly.\n\nThere are possible flaws in the film--the blue tint when the children spot the injured man. The unexplained Japanese dinner with Sake and Japanese music on the train. The significance of the cigar in the script is elusive. The choice of songs, however good, seem to be haphazard.\n\nThe script is otherwise brilliant. In glorifying the detritus of society, Kaurismaki seems to affirm there is indeed a link between the tree and falling dead leaf (with reference to a comment by a character in the movie). The train moves on. Forward, not backwards! \n\nMinimizing the world into a man, a woman, a dog and trains, Kaurismaki serves a feast of observations for a sensitive mind--a tale told with a positive approach to move on and seize the day. It is a political film, an avant garde film, a comedy and a religious film, all lovingly bundled together by a marvelous cast.\n\nFinland should thank Kaurismaki--he is her best ambassador. He makes the viewer love the Finns, warts and all!",

It&apos;s a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot &apos;em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.",

This film is very similar to Frank &quot;Basket Case&quot; Henenlotter´s &quot;Frankenhooker&quot;, but obviously shot with a higher budget and a more elaborated story. It never reached the status from its predecessor, the unique &quot;Re-Animator&quot; directed by Stuart Gordon, but it´s worth to be watched in any case! Especially Dr. West´s weird creatures like four spider-looking combined fingers, a strange symbiosis between arm and foot, and a dog whose leg was replaced by a human arm make &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; being a bizarre pleasure! At the end Dr. Hill and some creepy zombie maniacs storm the laboratory and destroy the property. Dr. West seems to be dead, but recently I read on IMDb about the production of &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; - starring Bruce Abott and Jeffrey Combs..."

      "reviewBody": "Well I didn&apos;t see the full version of this movie until a couple of years ago. I know it from a 1970s cut-down to 18 minutes Super 8mm film version I saw many times,long ago. Those were the days...\n\nWe need to work our way through a self-centered and self serving Jerry Lewis. As an earlier comment correctly stated, Jerry Lewis didn&apos;t manage to come up with the &quot;not too bright underdog with a golden heart, trying to live the American dream, facing many obstacles but making it in the end&quot; - story, even though this was clearly his idea of the storyline. You can call me names for my next statement: Sylvester Stallone did that thing much better (even though not through a comedy) in his first two &quot;Rocky&quot; movies.\n\n Anyway, this still is a Jerry Lewis classic with many great scenes. Undoubtedly the best being him doing a perfectly-in-sync routine to &quot;Blues in Hoss Flat&quot;, as usual impeccably performed by the great Count Basie big band.\n\nSome other material such as the radio that won&apos;t stop playing even when smashed to bits has been done much better in 1940s Warner Brothers cartoon shorts. \n\nThe two scenes where Morty (Jerry Lewis) meets &quot;living&quot; puppets are rather painful and reminiscent of Charles Chaplin&apos;s later work (Limelight etc.) It&apos;s in the &quot;crying Clown&quot; tradition and rather out of place in this otherwise funny and inventive movie. The puppets, a little clown and in a later scene a talking female ostrich, magically coming to life (yet obviously performed by rather average puppeteers) in a comedy are the only beings who really understand our &quot;hero&quot;? I&apos;m afraid this is very weak material.\n\nJerry Lewis also has his &quot;serius&quot; moment in movies like &quot;Cinderfella&quot;, and they are totally out of place as well. But that is a classic: a comedian trying to show his (or her) serious side. I will be tolerant and understanding (=forgiving).\n\nIf you are a Jerry Lewis fan, &quot;The Errand boy&quot; is a must see in any case. Jerry lewis definitely was (and remains) a great inspiration to contemporary film comedians such as Steve Martin and Jim Carrey."

      "reviewBody": "In an earlier review of the first Sissi film, I pointed out that the historical significance of this trilogy lies not so much in its account of the Austrian Empire before the First World War (this is totally fairy-tale history) but in its relevance to the post-war German world.\n\nGermans (particularly young Germans) were in a constant state of denial in the fifties and sixties. As late as the seventies I taught groups of West German students who would were not even willing to express an opinion about the possible future reunification of a still divided Germany and of course steered well away from any discussion of the unfortunate events of 1933-1945 - the &quot;you know what&quot; of the German world.\n\nAustria, spared by a sort of political conjuring trick from all implication in German nastiness, served as a wonderful alibi for the pan-German world and was the natural setting for a sumptuous epic (a film of the kind that Germany itself now avoided making).\n\nRomy Schneider and Karlheinz Böhm were the ideal representatives of the new generation, expressive at once of continuity and reborn innocence. Both had parents who were in fact closely implicated in the period no one talked about. Magda Schneider, who appears of course as her daughter&apos;s mother in the films, had been a neighbour and close friend of Hitler (she still lived in Bechtesgarten) and had also been, according to herself at any rate, his favourite actress. The conductor Karl Böhm had belonged to a quasi-Nazi cultural organisation (formed by the very racist Alfred Rosenberg)and had publicly and ostentatiously welcomed the annexation of his native Austria in 1938. Romy and Karlheinz of course had both been at boarding-school and were innocent of any such associations.\n\nThe average German did not so much want a break with the past but to establish a line of continuity that made the past somehow OK (even the &quot;you know what&quot;). It might be mildly critical of those nasty Nazis (as in the highly popular film Die Trapp-Familie, which came out in the same year as this second Sissi film, but were not prepared, understandably enough, to accept the burden of collective guilt for the past. Even The Sound of Music, the gooey Hollywood musical based on the German 1956 film, was felt by German audiences (despite the edelweiss) to be too strongly critical of the unmentionable past.\n\nIn the second Sissi film, there is the same pan-Germanic context as in the first (Bavarian beer and Bavaraian pigs&apos; trottters, the Tyrol and edelweiss are not forgotten) but the historical events (the Hungarian unrest and Sissi&apos;s fondness for Hungary are accurate) allow an expansion of the pan-Germanic space, balm to the soul of a divided Germany, beyond the German-Austrian world portrayed in the first film to include Hungary, traditionally very strongly linked, culturally and politically, with the German world but in 1956 a Communist state under Russian tutelage. It is not too difficult to appreciate the importance of this in 1956, the year of the Hungarian rising against the Communist government and its suppression by Soviet troops. The link was widely commented upon in the contemporary press and 350 Hungarian refusgees weer invited to the film&apos;s première at the Mozart-Kino.\n\nIn 1954 Leni Riefenstahl&apos;s Tiefland was released in Germany, controversial because it had been made during the war and had made use of concentration-camp inmates as gypsy extras. Faced by a hostile press campaign, Riefenstahl ttok refuge in Austria. Her tour there was, in her own words, &quot;a roaring success&quot;. In this film Mariscka hired gypsy extras for the crowd-scenes in Hungary, a fact frequently emphasised in the publicity for the film. \n\nToday a reunited Germany sees itself once again as the centre of the culture of Mitteleuropa but, even in the days when such things weer not spoken of, that cultural imperium remained close to the heart of most Germans. As Germany increasingly flexes its muscles and begins to talk incessantly once again of rearmament, let us hope that the future of that Central European imperium proves closer to the fairy-tale world of this trilogy, where even the reactionary autocrat Franz Josef is displayed as a benevolent liberal, than to the darker reality of the &quot;you know what&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "The Other Conquest --- A Film for Generation Ñ\n\nThe Other Conquest (La Otra Conquista) is a passionately directed, written and edited film by Salvador Carrasco and produced by Alvero Domingo (Placido&apos;s son). The story opens with the protagonist, Topiltzin, a blood relative of Emperor Moctezuma, having just witnessed the gruesome massacre of Aztec nobility at the hands of Spanish Conquerors. We follow his life as he, too, is captured by Spanish soldiers. Topiltzin is forcibly converted into an order of Monks, where he is renamed Tomas. Along the way, he befriends Dona Isabel, rightful (also renamed) daughter of Moctezuma. She has been &quot;converted&quot; and is being kept in marriage by Cortes. Isabel and Tomas depend upon each other, secretly, for spiritual survival and empathy. All the while, they strive to keep their cultural flames alive by however means necessary.\n\nIn his quest to unfold the beginnings of racism in Mexico today, Carrasco captures the nuances of prejudice and whispers of colonial oppression that speak to today&apos;s Latin-American in the same way that The Crucible and Roots spoke to their respective audiences. Indeed, much has been said concerning his astute reflection on today&apos;s society, and at a recent screening, Carrasco comments, &quot;I know this is all still present, because I see it.&quot; Carrasco, Mexican born, schooled at NYU, and current resident of California, is destined to become a prominent voice of Generation Ñ, the Latin Gen-X population. (As defined by the New Times Magazine, if you grew up knowing the words to the theme song of Three&apos;s Company AND ¿Que Pasa USA?, you&apos;re generation Ñ). Characterized by paradox and duality, Carrasco is true to Gen-N in his eclectic vision, score, and central issues. So much so, in fact, those moments depicted in this 1520s art film ring poignantly true in my own modern day Newyorican experiences.\n\nFor instance, like many of my generation, I was at first raised bilingually. But, in kindergarten, children with a Spanish surname were funneled into &quot;the bilingual program&quot;. It was a poorly concealed attempt to segregate the Latino children from the mainstream, grouping us instead with the &quot;problem&quot; children. It didn&apos;t matter that most of us spoke English perfectly, or that some of us didn&apos;t know Spanish at all. My mother fought it,and she learned a valuable lesson in survival: If your brown face and accented name weren&apos;t &quot;American&quot; enough, your voice would have to be. And so,I learned to speak Spanish many years later, in a classroom with a direct view into ex-president Nixon&apos;s living room window across the street. In this mostly White, well-respected parochial high school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I was both proud and embarrassed to finally be speaking Spanish. One day, as I sat in my itchy plaid skirt, mindlessly repeating words and watching Nixon&apos;s Latina maid vacuum the second floor, I was called upon to start the translation exercises. &quot;Where is the bus stop?&quot; Mrs. Hayne demanded. Caught off guard, I blurted &quot;¿Donde se queda la parada de la guagua?&quot; Mrs. Hayne, who had been educated in Spain, scrunched her face in disgust. &quot;¿La guagua? Esa palabra es muy fea&quot;. Favor de usar &quot;el autobus&quot;.\n\nIt was a thirty second exchange during an unremarkable class over fifteen years ago, and yet remembering it still causes pangs of rage that I hadn&apos;t felt since. That is, until I saw The Other Conquest.\n\nWhat set me off, specifically, was the scene during which a beautifully &quot;uniformed&quot; Dona Isabela sits at the garden bench with Topiltzin, now successfully monkified. They chat in their native indigenous tongue, until the Spanish guards appear within earshot. Then they stiffen their movements and switch to Spanish. Isabela is confronted by one of the guardsmen, who comments, &quot;I thought I heard barking&quot;. Mrs. Haines&apos; scrunched up face flashed before me, along with all of the mixed emotions I had felt on that day. And, I felt better --- someone understands.\n\nThis film is froth with such resounding moments. Shortly thereafter, Dona Isabela schools the guard on the functions of the liver in response to his ill-referenced insult. She sites the organ as the seat of all passions, which was a common belief held, (referenced by Shakespeare in The Tempest, some hundred years after Isabela would have lived) The guard was unfamiliar with this information. In the hard world of dual living, the minority needs to know everything of their conqueror&apos;s culture, though it never applies vice versa. This makes for an unexpected advantage on the part of the oppressed, and therefore, a threat. We recognize this as fear clouds the Guard&apos;s face when Isabela speaks, and we as an audience know that she will suffer for her wits.\n\nThis jarred memories of my days as a graduate student at the Universidad de Puerto Rico, where I taught &quot;American Pronunciation&quot;. One of my students bounded into class one day, ecstatic at having landed a job in the luxurious El Conquistador (pure coincidence) Hotel. She expressed her sincere gratitude at all she&apos;d gained from my class, because &quot;The Native staff was not allowed to speak Spanish on the premises unless approached in Spanish&quot;, lest the mostly American clientele feel offended. Nor, she added, were they allowed to kiss or hug each other hello nor goodbye. And unruly hair was frowned upon. In other words, they couldn&apos;t be Puerto Rican, and their knowledge of another language, their comfort with human contact, their very sincerity was unwanted as they served their American guests in their own country. But she maintained a smile as she told me of her new job there.\n\nThat &quot;square-peg&quot; status is all too familiar for us. Seeing Topiltzin in his Monk garb for the first time is, initially, comically shocking, then sad. His long, flowing, beautiful hair has been shaven off. It becomes heart wrenching to hear this foreign language spewing from his lips. Even in seemingly total assimilation, even when it appears to give us an edge, we are not accepted in our own country, as, ironically, we cannot accept Topiltzin. We can feel the sting as Topiltzin is made to bow to a Virgin Mary that bares no resemblance to him, maybe recalling those parochial school days in that scratchy, drab uniform. But we can also recognize our collective Latino culture&apos;s obsession with the paradox of a Virgin Mother. Gang members spill each other&apos;s blood with total disregard, yet turn the corner and sign the cross to a spray-painted mural of La Virgin Maria. An uncomfortable insight, we can feel the turmoil Topiltzin is suppressing in the name of survival.\n\nThen there are the issues around our names. Topiltzin is renamed &quot;Tomas&quot;, and that incites the obvious jabs we silently bare when one of us is nick-named &quot;Mr. J&quot; because Jimenez is &quot;too hard to pronounce&quot;. More complex is our Latino notion of a surname being a public sign of legitimacy and acceptance. Growing up in a poor minority community, I remember wondering why most of my classmates had different last names than their single mothers&apos;. To carry a father&apos;s last name, even if that were eventually to be the only thing he&apos;d willingly give his offspring, was a badge of pride --- at least in the eyes of the mothers. In reality, it was, more often than not, the child&apos;s sole, imposed connection to a man he would never meet. When Cortes announces that his child would bare his last name, but that his wife does not, it speaks volumes -- he is claiming the future.\n\nAlso pulsing through the heart of The Other Conquest is that ever-present need to procreate within one&apos;s own race. This is a theme touched upon by many of our contemporary artists, crossing forms and cultural bridges from Toni Morrison&apos;s Beloved to John Legguizamo&apos;s Mambo Mouth. In one of the most artistically gripping scenes of the film, Topiltzin and Isabela consummate their relationship. Devoid of lust, this survival tactic will ironically begin a new race, a generation of Duality and Paradox.\n\nDuality and paradox: again, my Generation Ñ. From the opening shot of the two faces of the Aztec Warrior, to the masterfully combined classical and primal musical score, to its different-yet-familiar format, our duality is reflected again and again in The Other Conquest. It seems that within a Generation defined and named for its very lack of commonality, we, Gen Ñ still don&apos;t fit in -- until we come together. There is no question in my mind why Isabela and Topiltzin had to connect.\n\nBut, ultimately in self-examination, when we play the steel drums, paint African Madonnas, and hang golden crosses from the necks of Gangsta rappers, we have to ask ourselves, &quot;who&apos;s conquered whom?&quot;\n\n&quot;That is&quot;, comments Carrasco, &quot;the question at the heart of La Otra Conquista. I didn&apos;t mean to answer it... just ask it.&quot; True, far from a Strum and Drang approach, the question is presented with neither lecture, anger, nor judgment.\n\nLike us, it just...is."

As such, it takes you on a philosophical journey, through which the director makes you wonder about the different ways in which we are looking at others (your lover, your family, a stranger) and at film. The director reflects on the film medium itself and on how film represents reality and affects us doing so. A film that also installs a strange, distorted sense of time. The photography and the editing are very well done, but the acting could have been a little more vivid, I think.",

Garbo had become a star in her first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And audiences waited til this film to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies. She did. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky, and Renee Adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents, Garbo sailed on for another decade. Despite the staginess of this film, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60. Charles Bickford is OK as Matt, and George F. Marion is good as Old Chris. Marion originated this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with Blanche Sweet. This Eugene O&apos;Neill play is a true classic yet, oddly, was never filmed again. Anna Christie ranks as one of Garbo&apos;s greatest performances. And despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story, she is truly a marvel. See this one for Garbo and Dressler!"

      "reviewBody": "MADAME DU BARRY, a wanton, vivacious young woman, catches the eye &amp; the heart of the aging Louis XV and quickly becomes his mistress. Through guile &amp; intelligence, she soon finds herself the most powerful woman in France.\n\nDolores Del Rio shines in this funny, lavish &amp; sadly neglected film. Her Mexican accent is more than compensated for by her fiery beauty &amp; fine acting. She is perfectly matched by Reginald Owen as Louis, in one of his finest roles, somewhat ribald &amp; ridiculously in love. An odd cinematic couple they may be, but they are never less than entertaining.\n\nAn excellent cast supports them: Maynard Holmes &amp; Anita Louise as the childish Dauphin &amp; strong-minded Marie Antoinette; Victor Jory, Osgood Perkins, Verree Teasdale, Henry O&apos;Neill &amp; Ferdinand Gottschalk as sundry court officials &amp; hangers-on; Dorothy Tree, Helen Howell &amp; Joan Wheeler as Louis&apos; spiteful daughters; Halliwell Hobbes as the English Ambassador; and Arthur Treacher as the snooty Master of the Bedchamber.\n\nMovie mavens will spot, in uncredited roles, Doris Lloyd as the madam of the royal brothel; and Robert Greig, as Louis&apos; chef, who shares a hilarious omelet-making scene with Reginald Owen.\n\nCuriously, the film takes great pains in making the Dauphin &amp; Marie Antoinette into sympathetic figures, especially during their bizarre wedding night sequence, only to turn them into villains in the very last scene.\n\nWarner Bros. must have spent a pretty penny on this film - and it shows. Its pre-Production Code status is also very evident from the somewhat salacious content &amp; dialogue.\n\nWhat really happened to Marie Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse Du Barry, after the death of Louis XV in 1774? She retired to a life of luxury in her private château and kept up a schedule of intrigues &amp; dalliances throughout the reign of Louis XVI. With the outbreak of the Revolution, Du Barry escaped to England in 1793. Foolishly, she returned to France &amp; was arrested on charges of conspiracy against the New Order. Du Barry had her appointment with Madame Guillotine on December 8, 1793. She was 50 years old.",

      "reviewBody": "The two leads were my main reason for seeing &apos;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&apos;. Helen Hayes (am more familiar with her later roles, so seeing her as young as she is here was really interesting) was a truly fine actress and wholly deserving of being one of the few Triple Crown winners. Have also a high opinion of Lewis Stone and he specialised in the sympathetic, dignified parts that require authority. The subject matter, a bold one for the time, also interested.\n\nAlthough it won&apos;t be, and isn&apos;t, for all tastes (with it being too melodramatic and stagy for some), &apos;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&apos; struck me as a good and quite powerful film and handles its difficult subject well. It is not perfect by all means, but in regard to a lot of early talkies from this period there have been a heck of a lot worse with stage play to early film adaptations wildly varying in particular. One thing in particular is enough to make &apos;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&apos; watchable at least.\n\nBeginning with what isn&apos;t so strong, it is very melodramatic and some of the melodrama goes overboard later on. Particularly towards the end, which was like being drowned in syrup (am aware what it was trying to do, it was just too much for my tastes that&apos;s all).\n\nDid find the dialogue too talk heavy and creaky and some of the pace could have been tightened.\n\nHayes however is an absolute revelation in a difficult role, and her Oscar was a deserving one. She is incredibly moving here while showing grit and determination, never did it feel stagy or over-acted to me. Her character also grows and matures, one that was rootable. Stone is sympathetic and dignity personified and the protectiveness is not over-bearing. Robert Young is suitably youthful and Jean Hersholt does noble very well. The direction didn&apos;t feel static or fatigued and plays to the actors&apos; strengths.\n\nSimilarly found the message admirable and that it wasn&apos;t laid on too thick, also in a way still relevant today. It&apos;s very nicely filmed and the production values are not too simple or over-elaborate. Really admired its tackling of its brave subject and found much of the film poignant and far from sugar-coated, so serving its purpose well as a tear-jerker.\n\nConcluding, not great but good and has power. See it primarily for Hayes. 7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "If one is interested in the action/adventure component of Tarzan movies, Tarzan&apos;s Peril does have something to offer.\n\nWhile the plot may be simple, this first Tarzan movie ever filmed in Africa does have its moments, mostly revolving around one of the sub-villains, King Bulam, played by noted African-American actor Frederick O&apos;Neal, founder of the American Negro Theater in New York which launched the careers of such notables as Sidney Poitier.\n\nGun runners have broken out of jail and have come to King Bulam&apos;s village to trade guns for jewels. Bulam, who has tangled with Tarzan before, intends to use the guns to make war on the peaceful Ashuba people, led by Queen Melmendi (Dorothy Dandridge).\n\nTarzan (Lex Barker) is unsuccessful in stopping Bulam and his Yurongan warriors and is even thrown over a waterfall and presumably drowned. King Bulam conquers the village and, after being rejected by Melmendi, he withdraws and his warriors get drunk. Tarzan returns and organizes an uprising after having freed the Ashuban men.\n\nWhen Bulam arrives to check on the situation, Tarzan gives his famous yell and the Yurongans are caught off guard. Bulam sees that Tarzan is very much alive and flees in confusion and fear.\n\nTarzan catches up with the husky, proud, ambitious, and greedy African war chief and a knife fight, one against one, ensues. While a much trimmer stunt double is sometimes visible, this is still an exciting screen fight. Bulam manages to knock Tarzan&apos;s head against a tree trunk and then pulls out a rather hefty, oversize knife that we have seen dangling at his waist for much of the film. The knife is almost in Tarzan&apos;s neck when Tarzan grabs Bulam&apos;s wrist and causes Bulam to fling the knife away. It lands in some ferns, blade side up. Using his legs as scissors, Tarzan manages to spin Bulam away, and the chief rolls over several times.\n\nHere is the part I savor. Bulam rolls over onto the clump of ferns where his knife is projecting skyward. As his ample belly passes over the knife, it is shoved into his body. The wicked, adventurous, risk-taking war chief is stunned; he has been stabbed with his own knife! Bulam makes several attempts to rise and continue the fight and Tarzan even draws his own knife, not certain as to whether Bulam is really done for. But, as his head lolls for the last time, with the knife partially obscured by all the vegetation the king has rolled into, it is certain that Bulam has been vanquished.\n\nThe next scene shows the warriors being herded into a corral and Tarzan is begged to stay for a celebration but he must go after the gun runners who are even now having a falling out of their own and, eventually, endangering Jane."

The catch is a series of rituals along with an unfailing Faith in your resurrection into Evil.\n\nHe paves the way and convinces the rest of his biker gang to join him. It is a small grass roots gang of 2 women and 5 other men. Most are willing, but a couple of them relent.\n\nAnn Michelle excels with a great presence as an evil biker girl. Too bad she wasn&apos;t a heroine more often, but the seventies were not a decade of risk taking, despite what people claim. Stereotyping was a seventies staple.\n\nStill, this film has a great atmosphere to it, a bit of humor, and some creativity, never detracting from the story line.",

      "reviewBody": "As a great admirer of Federico Fellini, I was really taken with I Clowns. It is not one of Fellini&apos;s finest like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, Amarcord, Nights in Cabiria and La Strada, but has much to recommend it. I did feel at times that some of the dialogue collided into another bit of dialogue a little too much. And while certainly not amateurish at any rate I can think of other Fellini films better in this good, again not bad, actually it is skilled but with a somewhat grainy quality and lacking the dream-like feel of for instance 8 1/2. Faults aside, the costumes are stunning showing a lot of detail, while the settings are just as colourful. Nino Rota&apos;s scoring, which is largely made up of parts of his other works, is bright and cheerful, yet doesn&apos;t in any way undermine the melancholic ending. The structure of the story is much more focused than Satyricon, and while I did enjoy the documentary-like approach of some scenes, it was the personal and nostalgic charm that is part of Fellini&apos;s style all over that made I Clowns so intriguing. The clowns are interesting with more than them that meets the eye, they are not as easy to identify with as some of Fellini&apos;s other work but they are hardly detached either. The acting is engaging at feels at least naturalistic. All in all, largely successful and well done if not among Fellini&apos;s finest work. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Charles Sturridge&apos;s adaption of E.M. Forster&apos;s classic novel is well in line with such other greats as &quot;Howards End&quot;, &quot;A Room With a View&quot;, and &quot;A Passage To India&quot;.  As with all of Forster&apos;s work, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; treats the topic of Edwardian British society with poignancy and humour.\n\nCultures clash when Philip Herriton is forced by his mother to retrieve the only child of his dead sister-in-law, Lilia, from its Italian father.  The baby represents both the English and Italian way of life, and the ensuing struggle over it is an analysis of just how futile our own nativist prejudices can be.\n\nSuch a sensitive topic is dealt with by a charming cast.  Rupert Graves is perfect as a man transformed by his horrific experiences; Helen Mirren is both laughable and lamentable as the tragically flighty Lilia; Helena Bonham-Carter is the soul of goodness, and Judy Davis (a Forster veteran from &quot;A Passage to India&quot;) provides comic relief as stuffy Harriet.  These fine performances are matched with a beautiful score by Rachel Portman and even more beautiful Italian vistas courtesy of Mr. Sturridge.\n\nStimulating and provocative, I highly recommend this film to those interested in either Forsters&apos; work or the imperialistic inclinations of the British circa 1900.",

      "reviewBody": "I caught five minutes of this then decided to watch more of it and I was pleasantly surprised at what a superb actress Kirsten Dunst is! She is so natural and at ease in front of a camera. The chemistry between her and the boyfriend is the best you will ever see and that&apos;s why I watched this movie. I felt like I was eavesdropping in on two young teenagers throughout the whole movie. The story is very simple and just chronicles the life of these two high-schoolers who fall in love by pure chance (the romance is instigated by Dunst and she does a great job). I think everyone will be able to relate to the characters and story in this movie. These are real-life characters and they are not overly stereotyped which was surprising, as well. The leading actor did a fantastic job, too. There is zero shock value thrown into this movie to try and put you on the edge of your seat which is something you don&apos;t find in Hollywood movies and which was really nice. Mostly every scene involves Kirsten and her boyfriend and they pull it off. There aren&apos;t many actors that can say that they can do that. This movie is entertaining throughout and will keep your attention. Already I like Kirsten more than I ever liked Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow, Daryl Hannah, Winona Ryder, Chistine Ricci, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Sharon Stone, or any of these younger female celebrities. The direction in this movie is very good. If you want a real nice relaxing evening and you don&apos;t want to watch something with a lot of hype, drama, violence, stereotypes, people pitting each other against one another, etc. then I recommend this movie. I will definitely look for more of Kirsten in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I must admit that I am rather impressed that the &quot;Die Hard&quot; franchise can remain this exciting and entertaining four movies into the franchise.\n\nInitially I found the plot of the 2007 movie &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; from writers Mark Bomback and David Marconi a bit off-putting, given the thematic cyberterrorism that the movie revolved around. But it grew on me and I came to like it as director Len Wiseman managed to put out a movie that was every bit up to speed with the previous three movies.\n\nThere is as much action and excitement in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; as there was in every previous installment in the franchise, so if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, you will also enjoy this 2007 movie.\n\n&quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; had a pretty impressive cast. Of course you have action star Bruce Willis returning to the John McClane character. But the movie also have talents such as Justin Long, Maggie Q, Cliff Curtis and Timothy Olyphant on the cast list. I was thrilled to see that they cast Timothy Olyphant for the villain in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;, however he just wasn&apos;t given as much material to work with as the previous villains did in the previous 3 movies, so his character came off as being less detailed and interesting actually, which was a shame, because Olyphant is a good actor.\n\nThe storyline in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; deviates somewhat from the formula used on the previous three movies, for better or worse. I guess this gamble from writers Mark Bomback and David Marconi is something that you either like or dislike. Personally, I enjoyed it, as it brought some freshness to the franchise, while it kept the essence of the franchise at heart.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; lands on a 7 out of 10 stars, once the dust has settled.",

      "reviewBody": "Say the name and most people will think of the 2016 animated Disney feature. I just looked at Robert J. Flaherty&apos;s documentary about life in Polynesia; after all that time in the Arctic filming NANOOK OF THE NORTH, a couple of years with his wife and children in warm Samoa must have been a very pleasant working vacation. In the early 1980s, a version was released with a new soundtrack, but I looked at a version with none.\n\nThese days our concepts of documentaries are informed by an additional ninety years of development. Documentaries are compiled by interviews and delving into archives and by following the subjects around, waiting for something interesting to happen in a cinema verite way; anthropology is a well-developed discipline. In the 1920s, there were no such standards, everyone was inventing new techniques as they went along, Paramount hoped to recoup the money advanced Flaherty for the project, and Flaherty understood the rhythms and techniques of film -- its poetry, if you will. As a result, to the practiced eye, many of the events of this film were carefully staged and edited. Wait until about a third of the way through the film You&apos;ll see a youngster, Moana&apos;s younger brother, climb a tall palm, gather coconuts, and bring them down. Not only is the sequence edited, with another member of the family watching, but the camera&apos;s vantage shifts dramatically, from watching the youngster climb -- from afar -- to watching him twist the coconuts off the tree -- from a few feet away. Clearly this entire sequence was shot over several days.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several bits that clearly preserve actual techniques of the period: Moana and her mother making cloth; hauling a turtle aboard an outrigger; cleaning taro, freshly pulled from the earth.\n\nIf there is a message in this movie, it is that these people live closer to the earth and sea than the movie&apos;s audience. Even a rural audience in this period would be thoroughly civilized, from farm animals, to guns for hunting, to harvesters, to the movie projectors and screens that showed them this film. There is a message that the riches that these trapping of civilization bring are fine and dandy, but so is a coconut you have climbed the tree to get for your family and yourself.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;My Left Foot&apos; is the remarkable story of Christy Brown, born into a working-class Irish family with cerebral palsy. Growing up in a life full of poverty and extreme prejudice, Christy defied everyone&apos;s expectations. Using his left foot, the only part of his body he had proper control over, the young man learned to write and paint.\n\nI could spend this review talking about the film&apos;s excellent portrayal of working class Ireland, and the working class Irish family specifically. I could talk about how the film does a good job of showing how the attitudes towards Christy Brown changed as Ireland&apos;s own political landscape changed. I could probably also talk about the role of women in Christy&apos;s life, from his mother and sisters, to the loves in his life. All of these things are worthy of mention.\n\nHowever, when talking about &apos;My Left Foot&apos;, there is one thing that stands out above everything else; that being Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis had already proved his acting chops in the excellent &apos;My Beautiful Laundrette, but it was this movie that put him on the map globally. And rightly so: he is absolutely fantastic as Christy Brown.\n\nActing is difficult at the best of times, when you&apos;re playing a fully-functioning human being. What Day-Lewis achieves, therefore, is even more admirable. It is an extremely effective and realistic portrayal of someone suffering from cerebral palsy, and the actor goes gung-ho with both the physicality expressiveness required for the role. It is a joy to watch.\n\nAn honourable mention also needs to go to Hugh O&apos;Conor, who plays the younger Brown. I can only assume that it is even harder for a child to go through the rigours that the role requires, but O&apos;Conor is brilliant. What makes the character difficult to play is that, in trying to make it look real physically, the emotion required can be lost. Both actors avoid that problem with what seems like relative ease: at no point does the efficacy or emotion of the moments falter.\n\nAll the other stuff mentioned above are worthy of talking about, if I intended to write a longer review. But for this small thing, I think it is more than enough to say that &apos;My Left Foot&apos; deserves to be seen just for this landmark Daniel Day-Lewis performance. Whatever you may think of the film as a whole, or whether you care about the story of Christy Brown or not, it is secondary to the simple appreciation for an actor at the top of his game.",

It may not be as good as the Wembley shows which had extra fizzle with the band in front of its home crowd but this is still a great show with classic songs.",

If Placido Domingo&apos;s face doesn&apos;t show very much of the emotion that boils below the surface, his voice is sublime. He was the best Don Jose I have ever heard.\n\nJulia Migenes would not be called beautiful, but she knows how to portray the sluttish and irresponsible sides of Carmen. You know this woman is not going to achieve lasting happiness because of her volatile, impulsive nature. Ruggero Raimondi as Escamillo shows why he could get women with animal magnetism. The parting of Jose and Carmen outside the arena is wonderfully poignant, a triumph of direction and acting.",

Hachi was born in Akita pref. in 1923. Because of his bent ears, people sometimes get wrong impression that he was a mixed dog, but he was a purebred Akita dog. His owner was a professor of Tokyo university. His house was big and located around area where Tokyu department store is now. He already had a pointer dog named John and another dog S when Hachi came to live his house. John, S and Hachi went to Shibuya station evade to see their owner off in the morning and were there every evening meet him. It seemed the happiest days for dogs. Unfortunately the owner died one year later and his wife and dogs had to leave home to make ends meet. The dogs were taken to different homes with different owners. Mr. Saito who was a member of the Japanese dog Preservation Association, saw Hachiko sometimes and he remembered him as a faithful dog. By the time he discovered poor Hachiko in Shibuya Station, he was already sad shape, dirty pitiful but still waiting for his ex owner. Mr.Saito detailed Hachiko&apos;s plight in the newspaper and suddenly Hachiko had became a famous dog in Japan. While he was still alive, his statue was erected and his story was told in primary school textbook. Ha ha Hachiko&apos;s tale itself was a pretty good, loyal dog story. But some people&apos;s reaction to Hachiko seems a little bit over-the-top actually. Anyway like I wrote in eddoko topic, my grand mom met Hachiko in her school days. Yeah, she said it was a dirty dog. :-). First Hachiko statue was melted once during ww2 to make armaments. The 2nd Hachiko in Shibuya station was recast again after ww2. Ah you can meet real Hachiko in the National Science museum with another famous dog Taro and Jiro.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LakIEfEOQSE \n\nand the above clip showing a Spanish person traveling the steps of Hachi to the statue.",

      "reviewBody": "Lawrence loved Arabia and Meryl Streep fell for Africa, but Diana, the leading lady of &quot;The Sheik,&quot; resists the desert with all her might. She reacts badly to Valentino at first, prefers to consort with Europeans, and threatens Arabs with a pistol she can barely shoot. As in every Hollywood romance, however, her heart eventually melts. Maybe this was an unexpected plot twist in 1921.\n\n&quot;The Sheik,&quot; will open the eyes of anybody who mistakenly believes that human history has been a steady march of ever increasing open-mindedness about sex. The 1920s were a more open, steamy time in film that the next couple of decades that followed it, which the &quot;The Sheik&quot; non-prudish storyline illustrates.\n\n&quot;The Sheik&quot; is not quite exhilarating enough and is somewhat disappointing if you&apos;re looking for exotic passion or a home video for date night. But it succeeds as an early romantic comedy, and distinguishes itself from other silent era fare such as the mawkish humor of Chaplain, the historical bombast of &quot;Birth of a Nation,&quot; and the serious reverence of &quot;King of Kings.&quot; For romance between appealing leads in locations far from civilization as we know it, &quot;Son of the Sheik&quot; or even &quot;Stagecoach&quot; fifteen years later are better bets. Still, &quot;The Sheik&quot; is historically important and more fun than most films of the time.",

      "reviewBody": "The film starts with a little girl in a playground getting bullied by a boy, and her mother telling her that this means that the boy likes her, setting up the premise that the more a guy treats a woman like dirt, the more she&apos;ll hang around on the phone waiting for his call. From this point we follow the relationship woes of six (no eight, nine, is it ten?) different people and their relationships ups and downs, as one guy is trapped in a loveless marriage, one couple realise they want different things and one woman who is trying to figure out how to play the dating game, the stories cross and intertwine and from this comical situations ensue.\n\nNow, from the tone of the last part of that sentence you may well have come to the conclusion that this is just another standard romantic comedy chick-flick, and, on paper, it should be. But it&apos;s not. The script is very similar in tone and feel to &quot;When Harry met Sally&quot; with &quot;supposed&quot; regular people introducing each chapter of the film, the insights are decent and the dialogue contains a lot of honesty that I think many people can relate to. The cast are all first rate with special attention going to Ben Affleck, who has so needed a good role in front of the camera for ages, and Jennifer Aniston as the couple who can&apos;t move forward, also good are Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connolly in their respective roles. The big star turns for me though are Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long as the hapless dater and the hapless dating coach, who are really good. For Long it&apos;s another step up the Hollywood ranks (pretty much the direction he&apos;s been heading since &quot;Dodgeball&quot;) and for Goodwin it is a star-making turn that should do for her what &quot;knocked-up&quot; did for Heigl.\n\nThe film of course has a number of elements and outcomes that are extremely predictable (it IS a romantic comedy) but there&apos;s enough other stuff in there, and definite surprises at the end, to make it more than just the sum of its parts. It&apos;s charming, clever and, when viewed with a pantomime-style audience that I saw it with, a lot of fun, and I&apos;m a guy! A cross between &quot;When Harry met Sally&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; that doesn&apos;t try and jump on the gross-out comedy bandwagon.\n\nGood stuff",

Asylum basically make rip off&apos;s of popular Hollywood films and try and capitalize on that popularity by releasing the film very close to the Hollywood films release date. Most of the press refers to them as &quot;Mockbusters&quot;. For example Transmorphers is, as you can imagine, based off of the Transformer movies and both of the Transmorpher films came out right around the same time as their Hollywood counterparts. Just look up a complete list of Asylum films and you should easily be able to figure out which Hollywood film each Asylum title is based off of. Asylum films are low budget and are released straight to video.\n\nAs for this film, it is a sequel to the first transmorphers and in all honesty is equally as bad as the original was. It stars Bruce Boxleitner,who has done a number of Asylum films, and his performance is as bad as one would expect from these types of films. Its almost as if Bruce knows this film is going to be terrible so he doesn&apos;t even bother trying to give a worthy performance. He is there for the paycheck. As bad as the acting is it is trumped by the absolutely horrid special effects and this is something that really boggles my mind as we have now gotten to the point where high quality special effects can be done on a 2000-3000 dollar computer. I am betting I could do better special effects on the Mac I am using right now.\n\nThe bottom line is I have seen a bunch of Asylum films, more out of curiosity than for entertainment value and each time I watch one of these films I am left absolutely speechless. The one question that I ask every single time is how does this studio stay in business. I understand that these are low budget films thus they don&apos;t need to make a lot of money to break even or even to make a profit however I am absolutely shocked that there are people out there that are willing to continually buy these films. You know the famous saying, &quot;fool me one shame on you, fool me twice shame on me&quot;, well that has never been more true than in regards to supporting this company by buying their films. I can see some people getting duped once after all I am betting some people actually mistake them for their Hollywood counterparts however to go back and buy another and another is just absolutely mind boggling. This is in all honesty the very bottom rung for motion picture entertainment. Even Uwe Boll&apos;s movies are like Oscar winning films compared to these films and his films are rated some of the worst movies ever to be made.\n\nSave your time and money and pass on anything that has the Asylum logo on it. I guarantee you will wish you had by the time credits start rolling, that is if you can even make it that far.",

      "reviewBody": "As gorgeous to behold as a Renoir painting come to life, this fin de siecle melodrama tells of a young laundress lured into prostitution by her sleazy and shiftless lover. Based on a novel by the French author Charles Louis Philippe, the film was meant to be shot in Paris - until budget woes forced director Mauro Bolognini to relocate it to the northern Italian city of Turin.\n\nIf anything, the switch works to the film&apos;s advantage. This story of love, lust and disease is a universal one. For all the pretty period trappings, the casual way in which the characters infect each other - one by one - with syphilis feels starkly contemporary in the age of AIDS. Exquisite on the surface but black at heart, Bubu is neither comfortable nor easy to watch.\n\nAs usual with Bolognini, the acting is first-rate. Ottavia Piccolo (so annoying as the insufferably virtuous wife in Metello, the director&apos;s best-known film) gives a powerful performance as Berta, the hapless young hooker. The pretty-boy Italian pop icon Massimo Ranieri fares surprisingly well as Piero, an idealistic student who tries to redeem her. Yet the film belongs to Antonio Falsi, who oozes reptilian sex-appeal as her ghastly lover and pimp, Bubu.\n\nVisually, the film is a triumph for cinematographer Ennio Guarnieri and designer Piero Tosi, whose costumes here are as stunning as those he did for Visconti on Death in Venice that same year. Best news of all - the visual and dramatic splendour of Bubu is now easily available on Italian DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "Biographies of strange people have always fascinated me, and this is no exception. And &quot;strange&quot; doesn&apos;t really seem to adequately describe real-life comedian Andy Kauffman. He was REALLY different, many times very offensive, sometimes very unfunny....but always extremely interesting and certainly unique.\n\nJim Carrey shows us once again how comedians can be such good dramatic actors. Carrey is outstanding in this role, and perfect for it. The rest of the cast is good, too, from Danny DeVito to Paul Giamatti to Courtney Love.\n\nRight from the beginning of this movie one sees how original it is, and how original Kaufman was as a comedian. His routines, antics and put-ons are so realistically done that no thinks they are just that. Unfortunately, his &quot;jokes&quot; don&apos;t always go over so well, aren&apos;t appreciated by most audiences and he is not always the most likable entertainer you will ever see. That means - be forewarned - that there are a number of unpleasant scenes in this film. You have to really appreciate Kauffman&apos;s absurd humor and to appreciate Carrey&apos;s great portrait of this man.\n\nOn multiple viewings (I&apos;ve seen it four times) I liked this film even more than the first time, even though I knew the surprises. I don&apos;t know of any comedian - to this day - who deliberately tried to annoy his audience or truly liked it when his audience hated him. I cannot believe he had the nerve to do the things he did. In summary, this is a fascinating biography, to say the least.",

      "name": "Beautifully Shot , Intelligently-Scripted TV Version of Dumas&apos; Classic",
      "reviewBody": "This is a made-for-television version of &quot;Le Comte de Monte Cristo&quot; which I believe qualifies as a masterwork. The feature was directed by David Greene and written by Sidney Carroll. Its basis is the famous adventure novel by Alexandre Duimas, the father. The feel of the piece is clean, to my eyes, the lighting very bright, the colors intense. I found it to be modern without committing in any sense a violation of its own century. Even those unable to understand something being of another age but not &apos;dated&apos; can probably still enjoy what I regard as a very superior production of this classic story. The cinematography by Aldo Tinti I find to be memorable, as is the lyrical score by Allyn Ferguson. The attractive and varied settings within the production design done by Walter Patriarca as well as the art direction by Andrew Patriarca with Walter Patriarca are very much above-average even for theatrical-release films. Also, Olga Lehmann&apos;s costumes help to establish period and mood admirably in my judgment; the French period illustrated with its Empire dresses and fitted gentlemen&apos;s clothing photographed very nicely. The story is actually a fairly simple one. Edmond Dantes, a gifted and honest young seafarer has taken command of a ship belonging to his company and brought it home safely after the death of his captain. Betrayed by enemies he never knew he had, he is accused of the captain&apos;s death and taken away from the woman he loves, his life, his world and imprisoned for fourteen years. He at first fears he will go mad; then he is found by the Abbe Feria, who was tunneling to escape the island prison where he too has languished, but ended up in Dantes&apos; cell instead. The two become fellow conspirators, and the learned cleric teaches Dantes all that he has missed in life as they work together to regain their freedom. He tells Dantes of a fabulous treasure on the Island of Monte Cristo, that they will be able to share someday. But he dies suddenly, after they have worked three years more; and Dantes barely escapes before the jailers come, with the map to the treasure and their tools. He returns to the cell where the Abbe&apos;s body has been sewn into a bag for disposal into the sea. Substituting himself after shifting the Abbe to his own cell, he waits. Thrown into the sea, he uses a knife to escape and survives the fall and near-drowning in good condition. It is his bad fortune to have to swim for hours before he can find so much as a floating log. Then they rescue him and take him in among them, for his knowledge of seamanship and more. He becomes a valued man, and learns that his father has starved to death during his absence. He vows revenge and seizes the means to it--the treasure of Monte Cristo. Recruiting loyal friends among the smugglers, he finds the five-centuries-old treasure. &quot;The world is mine!&quot; he cries. And with that, he becomes &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo,&quot; one of the richest men in the world, a man who can have the revenge Edmond Dantes was denied by those whose business should have been justice. Four men are his target, the men who have profited from their evil deed against him. His sweetheart Mercedes has married one of the four and has a son; but even she fails to recognize him when he turns up as the darling of Paris, the most-sought-after man in French society. One by one, ensnaring them through their weakness and their lust for his unearned wealth, he causes them to be ruined or find death or a prison cell. He has become, in Mercedes&apos; words, an &apos;avenging angel&apos;, no longer a man. But he is passionless about his pursuit of justice; it is for the viewer as if the innocent young Dantes were a man who had been done to death and as if he, the Count of Monte Cristo, were his separate champion exacting punishment for the man who is no more. But when he finishes, Mercedes does not see Edmond Dantes in him, only the vengeance seeker. This film is not about the power of wealth, but rather the wealth that power brings; for with cooperation, men ready to invest in one&apos;s schemes, men who can be bought or men who follow an opportunity, there is very little one cannot do. The flaw lies in a French society whose power-holders can be bribed and corrupted, not in the man who makes them offers they should refuse. I believe this to be far the best of the story&apos;s many versions. The cast is exceptional too for any film. Richard Chamberlain as the young Dantes, the prisoner, the smuggler, the avenger, the man is award caliber; he became &quot;king of the TV mini-series&quot; largely on the strength of this timeless performance. Among the men he seeks are Donald Pleasance, Tony Curtis and Louis Jourdan. As Mercedes, Kate Nelligan is lovely and suffers as well as she always does; her emotional range is admirably suited to the task of both losing Dantes and grieving over her threatened son, long after she has ceased to love her gamecock husband, Curtis. Trevor Howard is powerful and affecting as the Abbe Feria, lacking only enough lines to deserve awards for his work. Among the conspirators, Jourdan is coldly interesting, Pleasance admirably nefarious and Curtis, despite his accent problems, is energetic and intelligent. This is a film that I never miss, and I invite viewers to discover it. It is hard as a diamond, yet passionate, fast-paced and I suggest intensely-interesting at every point in its logical progression.",

      "reviewBody": "I missed Captain Video in the theatre in 1951. It played on an usual morning bill (for our town)for 15 weeks with cartoons and shorts. This was before most of the hinterlands had TV. We had heard about Captain Video, even seen the comic book, however this serial, even with the tinted sequences now available on DVD, bears absolutely no relationship to the TV series except for the name. I recently bought the DVD set and I must say even for Columbia and Sam Katzman this is just about, no make that the worst serial they even put out. Judd Holdren as the Captain comes across as very gay at times, not a lot of character development. Not much outer space goings on either. The villains on the red tinted sequences (especially poor Gene Roth)are dressed as Mongolian Tartars. The good guys on the green tinted sequences are all dressed as Arabs, everything else in outer space and on earth is in black and white. Special effects? Don&apos;t ask. The episodes and the cliff-hangers (where you can call them that) are just ridiculous by any standards. Knowing full well that this was directed towards 8 year old kids of 1951 and written by a veteran crew of serial writers, its an ungodly disaster! Approach it at your own risk.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Ugetsu&apos; is a Japanese film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi based on stories in Ueda Akinari&apos;s book titled Ugetsu Monogatari. At the basic level, this is a story about survival during the Japanese Civil Wars in the late 16th century. The film follows two married couples namely Genjurō and Miyagi, Tōbei and Ohama of the Ōmi Province. They get uprooted along with a lot of other families when their village gets attacked by Shibata Katsuie&apos;s army. Genjurō being a potter decides to go to Ōmizo to sell his wares to earn money. He goes to Ōmizo with Tōbei and Ohama while Miyagi decides to stay back and take care of Genichi(Miyagi and Genjurō&apos;s son). While in Ōmizo, Genjurō gets attracted to the mysterious and enigmatic Lady Wakasa and becomes overwhelmed by his interest in her, and Tōbei, who was always a bit of a delusional dimwit, gets more and more inclined towards living the life of a samurai and show-off his bravery and strength. Tōbei ends up seeking out Samurai soldiers leaving his wife Ohama alone and helpless during chaotic wartime.\n\nAlong with &apos;Rashomon&apos;, &apos;Ugetsu&apos; is considered by many critics to be the film that opened doors for Japanese cinema in the western world and gave the cinema in Japan a global exposure. Like &apos;Rashomon&apos;, this film was also based on Japanese folk tales, but Mizoguchi&apos;s humanist filmmaking made it relevant for the 1950s and its relevance hasn&apos;t waned at all in the last 50 years. &apos;Ugetsu&apos; belonged to a whole line of films that got released after WWII along with &apos;Rashomon&apos;, &apos;The Bicycle Thief&apos;, &apos;The Planes are Flying&apos;, &apos;Ivan&apos;s Childhood&apos;, etc. which looked at war in a critical way instead of glorifying. They critiqued the very purpose of war by brutally depicting its devastating consequences. Although &apos;Ugetsu&apos; is set in 16th century Japan during the Japanese Civil War, for me it clearly is an allegory for Japanese society during WWII and the allegory here is a lit bit more overt and obvious than the same in &apos;Rashomon&apos;.\n\nThis can surely be seen as a feminist film. We see the men fall prey to puerile ambitions and greed, while the women are left helpless and asked to fend for themselves during a time of war when they are more prone to danger and harm with ravenous and wild warriors running around everywhere. But the women in the film do what they have to do without showing any fear and without accepting defeat. After watching this film, I don&apos;t think it is possible for anyone to not fall completely in love with the character of Miyagi. She has unconditional love for her husband Genjurō and their son Genichi. She does whatever she has to, to make sure her son survives under difficult, harsh conditions, when Genjurō was spending time with Lady Wasaka. This film shows the hopeless nature of gender inequality that existed in medieval Japan and how women were extremely vulnerable.\n\nThe film as I mentioned before is an allegory for the Japanese society and the Japanese political system in the WWII era. Like Tōbei, some men are too drawn to the idea of power and will go to any lengths to prove to others that they are powerful by engaging in pointless fights. Genjurō represents those people who being led by unrestricted greed want to utilise war in their own way by making use of people&apos;s troubles to fill up their pockets. Lady Wasaka is very mysterious and interesting character. She is a very Mephistopheles- like character who lures Genjurō into her world by promising him eternal happiness, wealth and love. The Faust-esque Genjurō falls for her and abandons his own family. If the people sitting on thrones are led by the greed for power and the greed for lust and wealth, it can sometimes lead to irreparable damage to their country and its people. This might sound preachy, but the film presents this through the screenplay instead of blatant sermons. The film is also a commentary on the disappearance of Buddhist ideals and principals in modern Japanese society.\n\nAlong with Mizoguchi&apos;s style of storytelling, one can&apos;t help but admire the skill of his camera work. The film has many beautiful wide shots which serve both purposes - beauty as well as thematic relevance. There are some seamless transitions from one scene to another. Mizoguchi also beautifully builds tension and sets a Gothic creepy atmosphere in certain scenes which lends the film a genuine horror element. However, &apos;Ugetsu&apos; like &apos;Rashomon&apos; ends in a very optimistic and emotional note.\n\n&apos;Ugetsu&apos; is a film whose importance and significance in film history can never be questioned. It is an artistic allegory of life during wartime. As long as the concept of war exists in human society, this film will continue to have significant relevance.",

It turned out that the source novel was Brian Edgar Wallace, the famous writer&apos;s son. There&apos;s an interesting technique here: we are introduced to several of the characters as they wander about doing nasty things, like Lord Hans Nielsen raping girls, and sea captain Hans Hamacher blackmailing people without discussing why. As a result, the audience has an opportunity to solve the mystery of who the Phantom is before the police.",

      "reviewBody": "Forest Whitaker&apos;s ferociously charismatic turn as Idi Amin so dominates this intense historical fiction that it is honestly difficult to pay attention to anything else in this 2006 political thriller. Even though he is definitively the emotional locus, he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance, Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man&apos;s lack of hesitancy to take action, Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician, a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator&apos;s political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.\n\nScottish director Kevin MacDonald brings his extensive documentary film-making skills to the fore here, as he creates a most realistic-feeling atmosphere in capturing the oppressive Uganda of the 1970&apos;s. Helping considerably with this image are the vibrant color contrasts in Anthony Dod Mantle&apos;s cinematography and the propulsive action induced by Justine Wright&apos;s sharp editing. Screenwriters Peter Morgan (who also wrote &quot;The Queen&quot;) and Jeremy Brock have developed a sharply delineated character study of Amin, who evolves from a magnetic leader giving hope to his people to a scarifying tyrant conducting murders on an imaginable scale (at least until the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur). It is impossible to over-praise Whitaker&apos;s towering performance here. He conveys the dictator&apos;s playfulness as well as his unmitigated rage moving from simmering to full boil with a power that is at once bravura and subtle. His relationship with the fictionalized Garrigan turns out to be the plot&apos;s essential pivot point, although the contrast between the two can be almost too extreme at times.\n\nWhile McAvoy admirably captures the boyish naiveté of Garrigan, the character is drawn out in rather broad strokes that make his self-delusion all the more contrived as the story progresses. To intensify the political upheaval portrayed, the plot takes a melodramatic turn into an adulterous affair and even folds in the infamous 1976 Entebbe hijacking incident to illustrate Garrigan&apos;s increasingly precarious situation. It&apos;s all exciting and even downright brutalizing toward the end, but it also starts to feel a bit too Hollywood in execution. Kerry Washington shows genuine versatility as Amin&apos;s cloistered third wife Kay, while Simon McBurney oozes cynical suspicion with ease as a British operative. A convincingly Brit-accented Gillian Anderson makes her few scenes count as a weary clinic worker who proves to have better instincts than Garrigan. But see the movie for Whitaker&apos;s magnificent work. He is that good.",

      "reviewBody": "Tim Fehlbaum&apos;s Hell depicts planet Earth as a barren, desolate wasteland that was once infested with blooming life. The cinematography of the dry, insufferable heat is so containing and properly handled that it almost bathes the viewer in hot flashes to the point where I was totally willing to step outside with no coat in the middle of Chicago cold. In terms of look, feel, and liveliness, it&apos;s a seriously effective thriller. As a film adding to the recent popular but rarely impressive genre of post-apocalyptic thrillers, it&apos;s more or less the same thing we&apos;ve grown accustomed to.\n\nHell (also ridiculously titled Apocalypse in some retail chains) has one major selling point and that&apos;s its producer, the iconic German filmmaker Roland Emmerich, who has made a name for himself in the field of disaster films such as the American adaptation of the Japanese Godzilla series and Independence Day. Perhaps his producer&apos;s credit was earned in the fact that he saw a bit of his most recent film (at the time), 2012 in Hell. Unlike his picture which hammed up the nonsensical action and took almost nothing seriously in a long, winded two and a half hour film, Hell capitalizes on character relations and subtlety rather than tossing special effects at the viewer in an apparent contest.\n\nWe are placed in 2016, and learn immediately that the Earth has warmed at unprecedented rates, increasing 10°C because of solar flares destroying the atmosphere of Earth. The few survivors must shield their skin with excess clothing, gloves, smocks, and anything they can potentially protect themselves with from the increasing heat of the sun. We soon meet Marie (Hannah Herzsprung) a young woman traveling the ruins of parched roads with her boyfriend and younger sister. After picking up a man who claims that he can help them, (right after almost killing all three of them for their diminishing water supply) the three make an unplanned stop leaving the sister left in the car, which has its windows covered with newspaper and barricaded off. She is taken by a group of survivors who thrive on cannibalism in this newfound hellish world, and after her boyfriend splits, Marie and the hitchhiker attempt to recover her younger sister before she is subjected to uncertain doom.\n\nFehlbaum treats his characters respectively, not having them shout ridiculous lines, or commit acts of impulsiveness with not even a shred of a thought process as to why. He makes grand use out of his small cast of newcomers and on top of that, creates crafty tension with his co-writers Oliver Kahl and Thomas Woebke using long, uncertain shots that focus either on characters or dried-out, empty landscapes.\n\nBut the kicker here is the wonderfully captured, hauntingly displayed, almost blinding cinematography, that cinematographer Markus Förderer personifies into its own character rather quickly. He opens the picture showing off the film&apos;s inherently brutal climate with no points of being intrusive or to irritate the casual viewer. It&apos;s all a means to concoct suspense and atmosphere for maximum effect. Fehlbaum&apos;s Hell has its share of ups and downs, and after a while, you begin to realize you&apos;re seeing the same type of areas over and over again. Like movies of its genre, it fluctuates between interesting and not, repetitive and enticing, and beautifully stylistic and much of a muchness. Thankfully, its negative traits are minimized because the film never overstays its eighty-nine minute welcome and provides us with smarter entertainment than I&apos;m sure many of us were expecting.\n\nStarring: Hannah Herzsprung, Stipe Erceg, Lars Eidinger, Lisa Vicari, and Angela Winkler. Directed by: Tim Fehlbaum.",

      "reviewBody": "Magic Kitchen (Moh waan chue fong) has got a cast of beautiful people and a fun convoluted plot told in flashbacks from a few times, moods and perspectives. You will either love or hate that way of telling a story.\n\nIt is a story of how a circle of lifetime friends from kindergarten support each other and negotiate the sticky points of being adult and in the search for a partner or true love. It doesn&apos;t fit squarely into drama, comedy or romance genres, while having moments for all of them. While it makes social commentary on this age&apos;s shape of love and dating relationships, it is light, falling just short of fluffy. \n\nIt is sort of a watered down version of Like Water for Chocolate so far as the aspects of chef and cooking goes. The movie has definite parallels to the movie Woman on Top, with a chef, quirky unexpected plot turns, the bit of the surreal, and a woman who would be ditsy if she weren&apos;t so loved and smart. I liked this one better than the Penelope Cruz one because Magic Kitchen struck me as having far more believable characters, less sanitized view of choices in relationships, with less of a pat fairytale ending. \n\nIt&apos;s soundtrack isn&apos;t intrusive. It&apos;s cinematography doesn&apos;t take center stage but these things are considered. In the subtitles, it would have been handy in a couple places if the print on screen would have been translated not only the spoken words.",

      "reviewBody": "Monkey Business Cary Grant&apos;s second film with Ginger Rogers and his fourth and final film for director Howard Hawks has him reaching back into some of the lunacy of his previous work like Arsenic and Old Lace. Not since that madcap piece was Grant ever so frantic on the screen.\n\nGinger Rogers doesn&apos;t yield one inch of screen ground to him in that department though. In The Major and The Minor she faked being a teenage girl very convincingly and in this film she and Cary go back even farther in their return to adolescence. \n\nCary is a research scientist who is working on that eternal quest for the fountain of youth. A chimpanzee gets loose from her cage and mixes some chemicals and dumps the result in the water-cooler. Everyone thinks it&apos;s what Cary&apos;s concocted and the company bigwigs led by Charles Coburn and Larry Keating try to get it from him, but in his adolescent state it&apos;s no avail.\n\nMonkey Business does meander over into just plain outright silliness, but with Cary and Ginger you don&apos;t really mind. I do so love the way Cary with a gang of kids he&apos;s playing Indians with leave poor Hugh Marlowe tied to a tree ready for a scalping because the wolfish Marlowe&apos;s been making moves on Ginger. \n\nSecond to that is Charles Coburn and Ginger Rogers trying to talk to an infant who they think Cary has morphed into. Coburn may have been one of the screen&apos;s greatest actors, he&apos;d have to have been to hold his own with that baby. Note the dignified expression on his face never leaves.\n\nOf course Monkey Business is also known for having one of Marilyn Monroe&apos;s early screen roles in it on her way up. She&apos;s Coburn&apos;s secretary and note the expression on Coburn&apos;s face as she is showing Grant the result of his work on a no run stocking.\n\nMonkey Business is second tier stuff for Grant, Rogers, and Hawks, but fans of all three will like it and quite a few more than those people.",

      "reviewBody": "Can a horror film be scary and boring at the same? The Dark has an extremely good effort  about equivalent to lifting one&apos;s little finger. The plot shows all the attention span of someone reading a Welsh mythology after smoking several reefers. Formulaic scare-mongering knocks you out of your seat at regular intervals, though without enlivening the story or characters much, the most interesting of which, a girl called Ebrill, is temporarily back from the dead after a number of misled churchgoers and nigh on a flock of sheep have been offered in her place.\n\nYoung Sarah arrives with her mum at a remote cottage on the Welsh coast where her dad is staying. Legends, hallucinations, nightmares of sheep and people going over a nasty bit of cliff abound and we hear of how it might be possible for some people to pop back and forth between this world and the next  at a price.\n\nDirector John Fawcett, who showed promise and originality with Ginger Snaps, has here gone for banality enlivened by the most unashamed editing. If you flash a very sudden, very bright image at someone, and simultaneously make a very loud noise, they will jump. Traditionally, filmmakers have used this technique to emphasise a plot turn  the appearance of the bogey-man, monster, serial killer. Fawcett doesn&apos;t bother, he just inserts it. One minute you&apos;re watching the sleep-inducing story and the next you are shocked awake by a loud crash together with a bright light. Explain it to yourself as a deep insight into the unsteady mind of one of the characters? Well if I was a character in such an insipidly put together movie I&apos;d probably need to be deranged for fun too. The trouble with this technique is that there is no plot momentum to keep you excited until the next loud bang. After the first two, I started trying to predict the next one (wait for a false alarm, then a lull, then the bang) and with reasonable accuracy till I lost interest.\n\nIt picks up a bit towards the end, and the scares are scary, however contrived. All in all it&apos;s standard Saturday night horror fare, nothing that special. If you don&apos;t mind the clichés, sit back and go whaaaaaa (as I did!)",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It&apos;s hard to imagine a better choice for opening night of the 4th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival. After all, this year&apos;s theme is the &quot;No Wave Movement&quot; of the late 1970&apos;s, and writer/director Sean Baker&apos;s most recent film (and a Sundance favorite) is the perfect complement. Co-written with Chris Bergoch and filmed entirely on iPhone 5s&apos; (with cinematic apps), this gritty, no-frills film spotlights real problems of real people on a real day  on the real streets of Hollywood and Los Angeles.\n\nPersonally, I haven&apos;t seen many (ok, any) films that focus on two transgender prostitutes (both, persons of color). However, the exciting thing is that the story pays little attention to the vocation of Sin-Dee and Alexandra, and is more a story of friendship, heartbreak, and the sub-cultures that make up a particular community of the L.A. area. This is not the glitzy/celebrity side of Hollywood, but rather the underbelly of a melting pot city where the paths of transgender streetwalkers and Armenian cab drivers intersect.\n\nSin-Dee (Kiki Kitana Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor) are opposite personality types, but clearly good friends as they chat while splitting a donut in the opening scene. We quickly learn that Sin-Dee is fresh out of jail after serving 28 days, and she doesn&apos;t react well to Alexandra&apos;s news that their pimp (and Sin-Dee&apos;s boyfriend) Chester (James Ransone) has been cheating with a &quot;natural&quot; woman (played by a very talented Mickey O&apos;Hagan) while she was incarcerated. A woman scorned provides the energy of the film as Sin-Dee tracks down this mysterious girl whose name starts with a &quot;D&quot;. It also provides new meaning for dragging someone all over town (kudos to Ms O&apos;Hagan for the physicality and bruises).\n\nThe sassy banter is filled with brutal put-downs and smart-ass comebacks, as the three actresses play off each other as if loaded with short-fused fireworks. The story with taxi driver Razmik (Karren Karagulian) shows a family man drawn like a magnet to the world of Sin-Dee and Alexandra  he even finds a reason to skip out on Christmas Eve dinner with his family. His mother-in-law Ashken (Alla Tumanian) is most suspicious of his activities, and that leads to the frenetic and hilarious confrontation at Donut Time.\n\nMany individual scenes are funny, while others are tension-filled. There is even a scene in Razmik&apos;s cab featuring veteran actor Clu Gulager (&quot;The Virginian&quot;), and Armenian celebrity Arsen Grigoryan plays another taxi driver. The acting throughout is strong and humanistic, and the iPhone photography is shocking in its depth and range  we would never suspect the &quot;equipment&quot; being used. This approach allowed for the organic feel of the street – think of Banksy making a movie  clandestine with no sets (or permits). Baker&apos;s style is reminiscent of John Waters and John Cassavetes, and that&apos;s quite a compliment. The film also features the pitch perfect description of Los Angeles: &quot;a beautifully wrapped lie&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I caught this movie after a hard day of watching football during the 2014 world cup in Brazil. The movie is about the beginnings of the sport in the 1870s Germany or as it was known back then, an empire. Fresh from various military successes against the French and the English, national pride was deeply ingrained. Along comes Konrad Koch, a young German who had spent several years in England. With him he brings a football. He has been hired as an English teacher in the city of Braunschweig. There he encounters resistance to change amongst the snobbish kids and their even snobbier parents. Suffice it to say, the beautiful game paves the way for change. \n\nA charming movie. In a way, reminds me a bit of a more intellectual version of &quot;The Goonies&quot; seems like a stretch but its not. Definitely worth seeing. Goal!!",

Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a bicycle messenger in Manhattan who lands the unfortunate job of delivering a small slip of paper worth a ton of money. Corrupt cop Michael Shannon, trying to pay off a Chinatown gambling debt, gets wind of the item and attempts to relieve JGL of it. Unfortunately for Shannon, JGL is a pretty darn fast rider and great with stunts, and soon he has the help of his girlfriend (Dania Ramirez), who is also a bicycle messenger. It&apos;s just a simple chase movie, but it&apos;s perfectly edited and paced, with well-timed jumps back in time to explain the situation. The actors are all fine (I also really liked JGL&apos;s professional and romantic rival, Wole Parks), but Shannon really steals the show. This is the perfect place for his style of menace. Well worth your time.",

The first to worst Texas State team finds itself with a team of mostly &quot;non-athletes&quot; that came about after the school held open tryouts. The entire championship team from the year before had been suspended for violations. Scott Bakula plays a competent lead as a middle aged college athlete. Sinbad adds some fun to the story as another &quot;elder athlete&quot;. Kathy Ireland, while no actress, does add some eye candy to the film. I also like this film in that this rag-tag team does not reach the heights of being #1 or making it to a championship game. The &quot;big game&quot; of this film is when Texas State plays the the #1 ranked college team. The film has plenty of laughs, a touch of drama and competent script writing and players. Watch it on a Sunday afternoon when nothing else is on.",

A Parisienne (the delectable Julie Gayet) stranded on the empty streets of Nantes with no taxis in sight accepts a ride to her hotel from a stranger (Michaël Cohen), the ride leads to dinner together and obvious attraction, and that leads to his request for a goodnight kiss, &quot;a kiss without consequences,&quot; as they are both involved with other people. She says no and is persuaded (in fact this entire movie is filled with effectively clever persuasion) to tell him the story that she says would explain her refusal. That story becomes the majority of the movie, which Stephen Rea in the Philadelphia Inquirer, calls &quot;impossibly French.&quot; Kisses can be very powerful, at least they are to the couple she describes, played charmingly by Virginie Ledoyen and Emmanuel Mouret, who also wrote and directed the film. They have been best friends for years and he, in a funk over his lack of physical connection with anyone, persuades her—a married woman—to kiss him. And, while the premise may be a little unrealistic, it&apos;s lighthearted fun, delivered smoothly.",

      "reviewBody": "I completely agree with the other person who reviewed this movie.  The reason I saw it was the same thing -- the box looked like it could be really funny and maybe have a few good absurd weird things in it. It turned out to be one of the most unpleasant maddening movies I have ever seen. I strongly reccommend that no parent ever show to this to their child.  I can&apos;t imagine a normal child taking any joy out of this movie, because there IS no joy in this movie.  The whole movie is about suffering.  Nukie almost dies several times, and his brother is being tortured by scientists while he begs and cries in pain.  This is suppossed to be a fun kids movie but there is nothing light-hearted about it.  It is so intense and painful, only showcasing the miseries and trauma of life. Even more disturbing is it&apos;s strange political subtext.  At one point in the movie, an African child and Nukie are in desperate need of aid.  They are lost and tired and looking for America (this is where Nukie&apos;s brother is being &quot;imprisoned.&quot;)  The African child cries out &quot;AMERICA!  SAVE US!&quot; Could this be a commentary on how America treats other nations, or &quot;aliens&quot;? What about the name, &quot;NUKIE&quot;?  &quot;Nuke&quot;?\n\nOnly see this movie if you and friends are looking for absurd, kind of funny, yet painful puzzles to try and figure out (which is what I do)"

Well, he seems to have grown mature, but not tamed in that sense. He probably will be strongly criticized for the oral sex scene, on grounds that he is abusing disabled individuals, just like he was almost damned by feminists because of the looong rape scene in Kika. Well, although he seems to have moved away from his bright colors and chaotic chasing sequences, and although Live Flesh is to the best of my knowledge the first movie where he openly praises the post-Franco era, it was as tasteful as its predecessors. And who can build up such a web of events and relations better than Almodovar does, anyway?",

No, no, no!\n\nThe acting is just so bad! And I am not writing this as a movie critics opinion, I am just comparing to their previous roles!\n\nAnd of course it is all due to the directing!\n\nI love these actors and I feel so sorry for them having to team up with director (writer, actor) Derek Ting in this movie! Or should we say student film? The credits show only ten (10) people and one (1) voice-over. Also, the writing, lighting, cgi and music score all seem to be done to confuse and worsen the movie!\n\nThis movie is so bad that is...bad!\n\nIf for some reason you still want to see this, make sure you have very, very low expectations and you might somewhat enjoy it!",

Feluda, who is in Benares on holiday with his cousin and assistant Topshe and the inimitable Jatayu, is asked to help find the thief. The story moves along at a fast clip from the opening scenes when we see the holidaying trio arrive in rickshaws, with Jatayu having to constantly raise his folded hands to his forehead as they pass one temple after another. Ray is a master at showing the timeless beauty of this ancient city with its ghats, bazaars, havelis and gallis, and leverages this to the fullest to transform a mundane whodunit with a twist into a moody, sensuous, intensely funny and hauntingly musical piece of cinema which transcends its humble subject matter, but still delivers a darkly dreadful murder scene!"

      "reviewBody": "I say it all the time, but I&apos;ll say it again: Pearl Jam is simply one of my all-time favorite bands. Haven&apos;t done the top 10 or top 5 or whatever kind of exercise, but is very probable that the Seattle almost-old-enough-to-drink band would end in my 5 favorite bands. So you can imagine how f****** excited I am ever since their upcoming 11/24 show in Mexico City was only a rumor, was confirmed by the band and ever since I bought my ticket! This is going to be my very first Pearl Jam show (it&apos;s their third visit to my city tough but back then, in 2003 and 2005, I was too young and too stupid, and I wasn&apos;t a fan yet), it&apos;s their 20th anniversary tour, one night only (at a venue with a 50,000+ people capacity), and also the Cameron Crowe 20th anniversary film is coming in September (an exciting book and soundtrack too), goddamn, it&apos;s simply a great time for the Pearl Jam fan! \n\nPersonally my excitement for all of this has been translated into hearing almost nothing but PJ records during these days. There was, and still is (with all the official bootlegs nobody will ever end!), lots of PJ stuff for me to discover. This DVD was one of those. When I read about it I wanted to get it immediately. The main reason was that I knew its director Danny Clinch. I knew Clinch&apos;s WHERE THE LIGHT IS: JOHN MAYER LIVE IN LOS ANGELES. I love that film, so I knew Imagine IN CORNICE was something really worthy. After all, it was indeed not just another concert DVD, as its short set list indicated (in the back of the case there are 13 songs listed). \n\nTalking about the song selection, you have to keep in mind that this is about PJ&apos;s Italy tour of 2006 (the tour consisted in 5 shows, each in a different city – Bologna, Verona, Milan, Torino and Pistoia). So there&apos;s a lot from their 2006 album &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; (the film actually starts with 3 songs from that album – &quot;Severed Hand&quot;, &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; and &quot;Life Wasted&quot;). It&apos;s the &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; album plus some of the classics. Actually, it&apos;s literally that as we have, aside of the cover (Neil Young&apos;s &quot;Rockin&apos; in the Free World&quot; – also we can hear, as background music, the cover of Tom Waits&apos; &quot;Picture in a Frame&quot;) and &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; (that first appeared in the SINGLES soundtrack), only songs from the 2006 album and from the first 3 ones (&quot;Ten&quot;, &quot;Vs.&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy&quot;). This is certainly a great resume of the 2006 world tour, with nothing but perfect performances. For me the ones that stand out are the starting-slow great version of &quot;Porch&quot;, &quot;Betterman&quot; (the Italian crowd is great here, singing as loud as possible, and it ends with a great image of the four original members playing together in a circle), &quot;Alive&quot; (Clinch takes nicely an accidental fall of Eddie to edit this one as it was the very last performance of the film) and a f****** intense &quot;Blood&quot; (yet again showing that the Italian crowd is a great one, if not as intense as the Argentinean or the Mexican!). \n\nNow, let&apos;s talk about the other element of the film. The Clinch element that made me knew this was something else. The interview, backstage, sound check, being-tourist-in-Italy, and stuff, sort of element. It&apos;s absolutely priceless. Just to see how the band prepares an encore, you must check out this one. Or how Eddie learns his Italian lines, or how, hell, see by yourself! It&apos;s a great picture, perfect for the warm-up prior to the entire PJ20 extravaganza!",

      "reviewBody": "(Read the full review at http://nickplusmovies.blogspot.com)\n\nI started off my experience at this year&apos;s Toronto International Film Festival with Aki Kaurismäki&apos;s &quot;Le Havre&quot;, a rather obscure, small production that was competing for the Palme d&apos;Or at Cannes (it was Terrence Malick&apos;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; that was the big winner). The question is: Did I start off on the right foot? Read on to find out...\n\n&quot;Le Havre&quot; centers on an elderly, working-class shoe shiner named Marcel Marx (played by André Wilms), living with his loving wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) in the French port city of... Le Havre. Although his profession only leaves him with enough money to get by, he never gives up hope and always finds great joy and warmth in all the people in his life-- be it his friendly, selfless, next-door neighbor or the kind owner of the local bar. Marcel&apos;s life takes a bit of a turn when he must send his ill wife to the hospital, hoping she will get better soon. But that&apos;s not it-- soon after, when he finds himself alone, eating a sandwich at the harbor, he discovers a young African boy named Idrissa (Blondin Miguel) hiding in the water. Marcel befriends him and learns that he had been hiding with many other illegal immigrants in a shipping container, with hopes of arriving in London to meet up with his aunt. The old man voluntarily goes out of his way to keep him away from authorities and completely out of sight, but soon, this situation quickly transforms into a cat-and-mouse game, lead by the persistent, intimidating, wolf- like police inspector Monet (Jean-Pierre Darroussin).\n\nWith its simplistic plot, clearly defined characters, and inviting setting, this film has all the qualities and characteristics of a great short film-- if you don&apos;t count its feature-length runtime. Is this a bad thing? Hardly! I find that this makes the film all the more absorbing and enjoyable, though slow in progression at times and thus able to make your average modern-day moviegoer lose interest. But I still believe that sometimes, it&apos;s nice to just sit down and follow a naturally flowing, straightforward story, when most of the movies you see today are flashy and overly stimulating to the point where they bore you. &quot;Le Havre&quot; is something refreshingly different, for a change.\n\nRarely do films combine comedy with drama in such a natural, uncontrived way. With this film, Aki Kaurismäki proves to be one of the few working directors able to pull off a mixture of dark, ironic, and deadpan humor while maintaining the same upbeat, cheerful, and optimistic tone throughout the entire film. A great example of this guy&apos;s exemplary sense of humor is the opening scene of the film, where we see Marcel going around with his shoe shining materials, looking for a paying customer. He finally lucks out when he approaches a suspicious looking type holding a suitcase in his hand. As he shines this man&apos;s shoes, we see two other mysterious figures watching from a distance. It&apos;s clear that something&apos;s up. When Marcel finishes his job, the man pays him and quickly tries to escape. But it&apos;s too late; we hear gunshots, a tire squeal, and a scream as the camera lingers on Marcel, whose facial expression remains pleasant. He simply says: &quot;Luckily he had time to pay.&quot;. Of course, since it&apos;s more of a visual gag, it&apos;s much funnier when you see it for yourself. Having said that, there&apos;s no denying that this film has very smart comedic elements.\n\nWhat I love just as much-- if not, more-- about this little film is how authentic and down-to-earth the characters are in their interactions. Every scene is made into such an accurate portrait of life thanks to all of the real, human performances from the entire cast of lesser-known actors. The only thing that threw me off was how the couple of Finnish actors in the film let their accents slip through as they were speaking French. But this would be barely noticeable for those of you who don&apos;t speak either one of these languages.\n\nAlthough this film is Finnish, it&apos;s obvious that it&apos;s shot on location in France. I was breathless as I got to admire the beauty of the ocean and the quaint coziness of the old city buildings. Sadly, this is the closest I&apos;ve ever gotten to visiting France! No wonder these sights took me away.\n\nIn sum, Aki Kaurismäki&apos;s &quot;Le Havre&quot; is a simple, human tale that remains light and pleasant while brushing on topics of illegal immigration and the illness of a loved-one. It&apos;s a soulful film that mixes smart humor with true emotion, without ever feeling artificial. I recommend looking for this hidden gem. You might just like it.",

Thankful to Gothenburg film festival 2002 for showing it, I look forward to an opportunity to see it again.",

      "reviewBody": "After having high expectations of this movie, as I have with all movies with Priyanka Chopra, I regrettably say that this movie was nothing short of a total FLOP.\n\nAlthough it is admirable and even courageous of bringing new themes to Bollywood, no director could have possibly done worse than Harry Baweja himself. The bizarre and unique plot left plenty of golden opportunities for Baweja however, instead of directing a good movie, some directors feel the need to show off the miracles of computers and the special effects they can produce.\n\nDespite the terrible directing, this movie was further worsened by Harman Baweja, the actor that has now taken the new role of imitating Hrithik Roshan in any possible way Certainly, my condolences do not go for Hrithik as Harman is no match with his pathetic (sorry, I had to say it) acting skills. Hopefully this will show that being the boyfriend of a famous actress plus the son of a director does not correlate to a successful actor.\n\nWriting this comment, I wonder to myself, should IMDb not have an option of sending a 0 rating? If only they did I can almost guarantee that the rating of this movie would be far low than the highly generous &quot;2.9&quot; I see above me",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fairly entertaining pre-War cheaply made British musical comedy which sadly fails in a number of ways: it was the 3rd film with Jessie Matthews and Edmund Gwenn, and definitely the least satisfying of them; it was Hitchcock directing a non-thriller with his heart not in it; Hitchcock and Matthews didn&apos;t get on, and it showed in his screen treatment of her - Britain&apos;s top singing and dancing star at the time; and a ridiculously fictitious plot. Hitch thought it was the worst film he&apos;d ever made and Jessie thought it was &quot;perfectly dreadful&quot;.\n\nIt was an adaptation of a London musical stage play which apparently ran for over a year: Johann Strauss II played by Esmond Knight wants to be a composer like his father, I (Gwenn), who is arrogantly dismissive of his talents throughout. I&apos;m afraid I won&apos;t see Gwenn as Santa quite the same again. II eventually succeeds spectacularly with the help of Countess Fay Compton (was she ever anything but elderly and wistful?) and barmaid girlfriend Matthews - incidentally Robert Hale who played her father was her real-life father-in-law. Jessie was as usual good to look at (personally speaking) but unfortunately didn&apos;t really get to sing much, and Hitchcock was excellent as usual but didn&apos;t get to show off much. Most people will be disappointed with the latter, but for myself it was with the lack of Jessie&apos;s beautiful singing voice in what was after all billed as a musical, and with her name over the title. On the other hand, Hitchcock seemed to be mining the One Hour With You stylistic vein a lot of the time albeit in a cheaper but still pleasant British way, there were some nice sets and of course there was Louis Levy&apos;s orchestrations for The Blue Danube to admire when it arrived. The less said about how II was supposed to have composed it here, the better!\n\nIt&apos;s a pleasant enough 76 minutes for someone like me who isn&apos;t a Hitchcock completist, but probably will be a real chore if you are.",

So when Jeff is stolen away by Anna, a beautiful actress, Sophie wants revenge. \r\n\r\nThe first step in her plan, Â“Sympathy and Understanding,Â” fails, as does the second step, Â“Nostalgia.Â” SophieÂ’s friends invite her out to a party to cheer her up, but she runs into Jeff and Anna. She also runs into Gordon, a photographer, who apparently has been recently dumped by Anna. She quickly elicits his help in her revenge campaign. \r\n\r\nWith Gordon, Sophie continues to implement the other steps of her plan. But Â“ReinventionÂ” fails. So does Â“Entrapment.Â” Gordon reluctantly agrees to help Sophie with Â“Arousing Jealousy,Â” where they both behave like lovers in front of Jeff and Anna. Finally, something in her plan begins to work: Jeff seems to be jealous.  A thrilled Sophie is convinced that the next step, Â“Search and Rescue,Â” will be her final winning move.  \r\n\r\nBut Gordon refuses to help, and confesses that he has fallen in love with Sophie, who, sooner than expected, is confronted by a repentant Jeff who wants her back! Who should she choose for true love and happiness?.",

      "reviewBody": "English film critics, especially those at a loss for what else to write, often refer to films such as this as &apos;very French&apos;. This certainly holds true in so far as French cinema is mainly concerned with character rather than plot.\n\nClaude Sautet was a respected &apos;script doctor&apos; before his breakthrough film &apos;Les Choses de ma Vie&apos; which not only put him on the map but made an international star of Michel Piccoli and revitalised the career of Romy Schneider. He went from stength to strength and made his last film &apos;Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud&apos; in 1995 starring Michel Serrault and Emmanuelle Beart.\n\n&apos;A Heart in Winter&apos; is his penultimate film and is as one would expect from Sautet, a piece both beautifully written and constructed. Sautet has here collaborated on the script with Jacques Fieschi loosely based on the novella &apos;Princess Mary&apos; by Lermontov. The plot is easily told. Camille, Maxime and Stéphane move within the cloistered world of classical music. Camille is having an affair with Maxime but falls for Stéphane and is devastated by his refusal to respond. Emmanuelle Béart as Camille convinces totally as a professional musician and took violin lessons for a year to prepare for the role. She was of course destined to be underrated as an actress because of her beauty. To describe the Stéphane of Daniel Auteuil as &apos;enigmatic&apos; would be an understatement. A woman might very well be attracted to elusiveness in a man but there is a limit to her patience. That Auteuil and Bart were romantically involved at the time brings a definite piquancy to the film. As Maxime André Dussollier is splendid and the supporting players uniformly excellent. The cinematography of Yves Angelo is stunning and the use of Ravel&apos;s music inspired. Sautet was one of the last true craftsmen of French cinema and if as some say this film is a little cold then it is the coldness of a polished gem.",

      "reviewBody": "Le fantôme de la liberté (Buñuel, 1974) seems to take off right from this film as if it were a sequel, visually and conceptually.  This film however is much more determined to denounce the contradictions and hypocrisy of different religions, while Fantôme has even more artistic freedom.  Also this is much more coherent and if there is any danger of getting heavy-handed, Buñuel knows how to joke himself a way out using illusionism or a mild shock-treatment.  It is simultaneously very rational and miraculous.  The anti-clericism and subversive desires frequently come to the surreal surface.  I can&apos;t help but see this as an inspiration for Monty Python&apos;s &apos;Life of Brian&apos; (1979), because that film also remotely feels like an off the wall road movie in which anything can happen.\n\nThe subject matter was sort of tough for an atheist (heretic?) like me, but the humour with which Buñuel lets the characters throw the crucial differences between religions at each other is hilarious.  E.g. in the middle of a duel between a Catholic and a Jesuit: &apos;Prior will is mere impulse.  My thoughts and my will are not in my own power ... ma liberte est un fantôme.&apos; &apos;What does freedom mean anyway?  How can I be free if what I do is determined in advance?&apos; etc.  And why would all the personnel of a restaurant be caught up in an eloquent discussion about the existence of God while they are at work?  See for yourself.  Cinematographer Christian Matras (also Le Grande Illusion, 1937) continues to improve Buñuel&apos;s visual style using zoom-pan-zoom shots for instance, but keeps it sober.\n\n9/10"

This has Barry K Barnes as a young lawyer, who exasperates his senior partner A.Sim by acting for enemy spies and getting them cleared on technicalities, his motive is to infiltrate the gang and get the head man, its quick competent, watchable and of course it has A.Sim always a delight. The Director is the undervalued David MacDonald who was active from the late 30&apos;s to early 60&apos;s, his most fun film being DEVIL GIRLS FROM MARS (1954) a rare example of a 50&apos;s British sci-fi film, and as with LAW AND DISORDER, not to be taken seriously. Alastair Sim was a great talent he was in films for 40 years from the mid 30&apos;s his best work being SCROOGE (1951); both of them were Scottish they worked together on two other films THIS MAN IS NEWS (1938) &amp; THIS MAN IN Paris (1940), along with B.K.Barnes (English). To sum up if you get the chance this is no masterpiece, but is worth 75m of any fan of old British films, enjoy!",

      "reviewBody": "Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early showing on 10-22-09, and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion.\n\nDon&apos;t let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel.\n\nThe laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn&apos;t seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all&apos;s of &quot;The Word&quot;, but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.\n\nThe acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren&apos;t hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself.\n\nAnd I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie."

Susan Clark played a lot of these kind of roles in the late &apos;60s to about 1980. Clint Eastwood and Don Stroud are the male leads and Eastwood fits the mold as a tough Arizona lawman going to New York City to bring back an escaped convict. This kind of set of the stage, I think, for his Dirty Harry series which began a couple of years after this.\n\nThe story moves well and has some good action scenes, but, man, you can tell it is the late &apos;60s and no longer the &quot;classic era&quot; in Hollywood with the nudity and no one with any moral standards.",

      "name": "A different kind of film from Woody Allen",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; is Woody Allen&apos;s tribute to German Expressionism, and it&apos;s very interesting, often funny, and at times downright strange. He gives no indication of the setting or time, and as is often true with Allen, there&apos;s a serious undertone. His nebishy character, Kleinman, is woken up in the middle of the night in his home for reasons having to do with a serial killer at large. Poor Kleinman doesn&apos;t know exactly what he has to do with anything, but as he puts it, everything seems to know what he&apos;s supposed to be doing but him. Across town, Mia Farrow is the circus performer Irmy, who finds out her boyfriend (John Malkovich) is cheating on her, so she leaves him. She winds up in a brothel with some real characters played by Lily Tomlin, Kathy Bates, and Jodie Foster. A client (John Cusack) declares himself in love with Mia and offers her money to sleep with him. When it gets up to $700, she accepts. Later she meets Kleinman and sends him to the church to donate all but $50. The priest is impressed, and the police cross Kleinman&apos;s name off the list of suspects. Then they meet a beggar, and she sends Kleinman back for half the money. Kleinman&apos;s name goes back on the list of suspects.\n\nYes, it&apos;s an odd but fascinating film. The atmosphere is bizarre, very German - dark, bleak, and foggy, with a scary serial killer out of &quot;M.&quot; Big stars float in and out of the film, like Madonna, some with tiny roles. The funniest scene is when Kleinman tries to hide out at his ex-girlfriend&apos;s (Julie Kavner) who calls him every name in the book and then tries to turn him in.\n\nKleinman is an innocent man caught in confusing circumstances and times, not sure which side he should be on - there are two factions trying to catch this killer, and both attempt to recruit him - and all the poor guy wants is a promotion at his job. Though his reactions are often amusing, imagine being awoken by the police in the middle of the night and having no idea what it&apos;s about. It&apos;s happened, though, as it happens in the film. As Kleinman wanders the streets, unsure of where he&apos;s going, we can relate.",

      "name": "Intrigue, love and loyalty: a big-budget portrait of a 17th century Spanish mercenary",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s big-budget, it boasts extras by the planeload, and a broad historical panorama: it&apos;s all about intrigue, loyalty, love, and loads of a real man doing what a real man&apos;s gotta do. This is the Spanish film industry&apos;s most serious attempt yet to break into the mainstream international market, and Viggo Mortensen&apos;s brooding, laconic Alatriste makes a convincing bid for the job. A heroic figure despite himself, Alatriste is the poor bloody footsoldier whose unquestioning courage provided the flesh and blood foundations of the Siglo de Oro, the golden age of the early 17th Century when the Spanish crown laid claim to half of western Europe.\n\nIn scuffed boots and floppy fedora, Mortensen cuts an attractive figure in an amoral, down-at-heel sort of way: women are prepared to leave their husbands for him, men fight for the privilege of dying at his side. We are led, or perhaps bullied, on an epic sweep through the muck and bullets of Spain&apos;s military meddling in its neighbours&apos; affairs, seen through the jaundiced eyes of Alatriste and his fellow hired hands. Death is a constant presence; if you&apos;re not torn apart by a cannonball on the battlefield, or knifed in a dark alley, it may well come for you in the shape of the Inquisition  and in which case, you might be better off cutting your own throat.\n\nWe cut frantically and frequently back to the Spanish court, where the grandees plot and connive, and we just know that someone inconvenient is about to get dispatched to the colonies at the very least. Here, Alatriste&apos;s glint-eyed soldier&apos;s determination gives way to the quizzical gaze of a hard man out of his depth, as matters of State are signed and sealed on oaken desks. Watch your back -- you get the impression that the most blood-sodden battlefield is a far safer place to be.\n\nThe film covers a massive swathe of turbulent European history, some three decades of a long Spanish Catholic struggle against the Protestant heretics of the Low Countries. And this, perhaps, is the film&apos;s greatest flaw  the screenplay is a pull-together of some of the most dramatic episodes from a clutch of Arturo Pérez-Reverte&apos;s Captain Alatriste books, and the joins show badly. Sub-plots come and go in a tangle, and the film develops its undoubted dynamism from a regular dripfeed of another bit of swashbuckling, or whispered courtly dirty deeds, rather than the convincing development of any interplay between the characters themselves. For such a valiant warrior, poor Alatriste doesn&apos;t seem to have much say in his destiny.\n\nThat said, the film looks fabulous, from the opening misty waterlogged shots off the Flanders coast, to the final crunching battle of Rocroi. Director of Photography Paco Femenia -- responsible for the similarly atmospheric Carmen and Juana la Loca -- takes his inspiration from the contemporary canvases of Velásquez to evoke an atmosphere painted in rich earthy tones; the camera conveys the glittering sterility of the Spanish court as tangibly as the dirt that Alatriste and his ever-dwindling band of chums are forced to eat  so often without pay -- to enable their lordships to live in the appropriate style.\n\nThe film, at two hours and 20 minutes, rattles along well, but is too long. If only director Augustín Díaz Yanes had the faith in the attraction and bankability of his lead character to take a deep breath, and slice the action up into more manageable chunks: a trilogy, even. Why not? Everybody else seems to be doing it, and so often with inferior material to this.",

But boy do I miss them. &quot;Night of the Juggler&quot; is a jaunty, outrageous and politically incorrect very late 70s chase thriller filled with a lot running, chaotic driving (stealing police cars), chewy dialogues and ballsy beat-ups. It&apos;s a relentlessly raw and intense barrage, as our protagonist violently bounces from here to there encountering cops, corrupt cops, an ex-wife, pimps, prostitutes, bouncers and street gangs along the authentically seedy strips of New York in his quest to find his kidnapped daughter. In what was a bungled napping attempt of mistaken identity although the kidnapper still believes he has the right girl; that of a wealthy real-estate owner. Now just wait until James Brolin&apos;s ruggedly scruffy ex-cop character gets his hands on the madcap kidnapper. There&apos;ll be hell to pay! Everyone he comes across that stands in his way have felt it. The pulpy plot might be &quot;heavily&quot; contrived, unpleasant and fairly ridiculous, as it goes beyond and pushes reality many times. However this one-man riot machine provides on-going gritty, seedy and unapologetic excitement. No one is safe from this one man&apos;s devotion. &quot;I&apos;ve got to find my little girl.&quot; A chiselled Brolin is fitting in the central role, looking and acting the part. Cliff Gorman is particularly edgy as the scummy kidnapper. Then you have Richard S. Castellano bringing some solidity and Dan Hedaya is memorable as a psychotic cop. Director Robert Butler provides great location staging for its action and keeps a frenetic pace keeping things rough and ready. It might not be high-art, but this grungy, slam-bang action fodder is smashing entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Sister Act \n\nDeloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is a lounge singer at a successful Reno casino, and is also the mistress of its manager, Vince LaRocca (a lazy Harvey Keitel), a drugs baron. Feeling unloved, she finally decides to quit her job at the casino and split up with Vince when he gives her his wife&apos;s old fur coat as a present. But then Deloris accidentally walks in on Vince dispatching one of his snitch employees, and literally has to make a run for her life. Taking refuge with the police, she discovers that she is required to testify in court when Vince is charged for his dirty deeds. But until then, the police arrange for her to hide out at a nunnery in Chicago, overseen by the Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). As Deloris reluctantly adapts to her new lifestyle as Sister Mary Clarence, she strikes up friendships with the unsuspecting nuns at the monastery, and even finds a way to put her singing skills to good use. But wherever she goes, Vince is never far behind \n\nThe above plot synopsis is likely to imply to the unknowing that &apos;Sister Act&apos; is a &quot;woman in jeopardy&quot; thriller, when actually it&apos;s the complete opposite. The creators of the film seem to have designed a worthy fish-out-of-water comedy, and then simply used the bookends of the film as window dressing. It&apos;s all the story you need, though, when you have Whoopi Goldberg in the lead.\n\nI&apos;ve always had a preferment to Goldberg&apos;s shockingly underused skills as a dramatic actress, but her funny act can make virtually any film enjoyable. This is one of them. However, this being a family film, the climax is slightly underwhelming, and seems to be trying to be funny that actually letting off tension. But &apos;Sister Act&apos; is a decent comedy regardless.\n\n~ 7/10 ~",

      "name": "I found this Cyborg in the woods Can I keep it?",
      "reviewBody": "The downfall of the great Italian cult cinema was largely caused by an endless stream of hopelessly inept Sci-Fi/action flicks during the second half of the 1980s. These were shameless imitations of blockbuster hits like &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Robocop&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot; or &quot;Predator&quot;, but unlike during the seventies or early eighties, the Italians somehow became uninspired, lazy and exaggeratedly amateurish so that their once glorious rip-offs suddenly became pathetic low-budget flicks that almost were almost instantly exiled to the lowest shelves of insolvent video stores! True story, I assure you, and &quot;CY Warrior&quot; is the prototypic example of this sad trend. This was supposed to be a fun and exhilarating &quot;The Terminator/Robocop&quot; rip-off, but due to the imbecilic script and unimaginably clumsy post-production work, it turned out to be a B- movie disaster that even soiled the career of the great Henry Silva. Blond poster boy Frank Zagarino stars as a hi-tech and secretly developed cyborg that escapes from his freezer on a military research vessel. The US government promptly sends out a team of soldiers to destroy him, led by the sadist Hammer (Silva) who doesn&apos;t mind using heavy artillery in places crowded with innocent civilians and making lots of collateral damage. The incredibly annoying teenage kid Brandon discovers the wounded cyborg in the woods and takes it back home to his 18-year- old sister Susan. Instead of wondering what the hell a cyborg is doing in their living room, they teach him how to eat hamburgers (by the way, this has got to be the single most retarded sequence of the entire eighties), how to shop for ugly clothes and – of course – how to dance! The girl naturally also falls more or less in love with the cyborg and repeatedly states that she – and I quote – &quot;keeps forgetting that he isn&apos;t a real human being&quot;. Personally, I find that rather impossible to believe, especially since the cyborg makes a conspicuous mechanical noise every single time he turns his head. So, we are to believe that he is a state-of-the-art piece of intelligent engineering whose stomach is even adapted to processing actual food, but somehow they can&apos;t make his head move in silence. Meanwhile, Henry Silva keeps annihilating innocent bystanders and shouting &quot;I don&apos;t give a good God damn!&quot; The shootout sequences are pretty tame and there&apos;s a shortage of gore, with the exception of a blatant imitation of a famous &quot;Terminator&quot; scene where the cyborg fixes the burning wounds on its own face. Writer/director Giannetto De Rossi delivered fantastic work as principal make-up artist for the films of Lucio Fulci (&quot;The Beyond&quot;, &quot;Zombie 2&quot;) and other acclaimed horror directors, but perhaps he shouldn&apos;t have moved to the director&apos;s chair himself. In short, if you&apos;re looking for a B-movie disaster with laughable stunts, horrendous English dubbing and an absolutely retarded melodramatic climax, I highly recommend &quot;CY Warrior&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I have to be biased here: I love Meth and Redman&apos;s music. Whether it&apos;s solo, in collaborations with others, or when they do an album together. these two are among the premier rappers in the industry. So despite the films heavy emphasis of promoting marijuana use, which I&apos;m not sold on, I had to see this movie, because I&apos;m a big fan of rap music and would rather see these guys in films over the likes of Britney and Mariah any day.\n\nHow High is hilariously funny, but it&apos;s not for everybody. You have to be fans of these fine gentlemen or have a crazy sense of humour. The rappers play Silas and Jamal, two young men who live for their pot and sexing. One day, after a friend of Silas was killed in a hilarious accident, Silas and Jamal are smoking a potent type of pot that gives them a high that allows them to &quot;see dead people&quot;, namely Ivory, the man who was killed in the accident. He is able to give them the answers to all the questions on their SATs and that allows them to go to any college they want, and so they pick Harvard.\n\nThe film has them doing their thing, turning Harvard upside down with their decidedly different attitude and angering the dean (Obba Babatunde, with his name as Dean Cain, after the actor from Superman:The Series).\n\n There are some crazy scenes in this film, such as when they run out of the special pot and they go to a graveyard to dig up the body of President John Quincy Adams, hoping that his brain could help them pass the courses or that weirdo who passes out tickets reacts to seeing his bicycle being destroyed. This film is so out there!\n\nThe acting is actually good and the characters have vibrancy. Also in the film are another great rap group, Cypress Hill, and former NBC alums Anna-Marie Horsford (Amen), Fred Willard (DC Follies), and yes, Lisa from Saved By The Bell (Lark Voorhies).\n\nThe DVD contains a lot of stuff, from the usual documentaries, music videos, commentary, etc to neat things like the &quot;Hide The Stash&quot; game where you have to find Meth and Red&apos;s pot by clicking on the correct 420 and there&apos;s even a preview of Eminem&apos;s &quot;8 Mile&quot; film. All in all, a lot of fun; if you&apos;re like me in my mind frame, see it. This film might be a cult rental like Showgirls and The Doors are for me."

It&apos;s a tense and highly watchable tale that makes Frank Sinatra&apos;s sole directorial credit, and he also co-stars in the movie as the medic of the group.\n\nThe tale is quite low key and more of a character piece than an action film. There are action scenes here, but they&apos;re few and far between and low budget. Nonetheless the film looks classy and expensive with fine cinematography that brings the lush locations to life. As an anti-war piece of filmmaking, it ploughs much the same furrow as HELL IN THE PACIFIC, exploring the way in which all soldiers are the same and the parallels between the two units despite their utmost grievances.\n\nThere are some exemplary performances amid the cast members. Clint Walker is exceptional as the nominal group leader and Tatsuya Mihashi his equal as his Japanese rival. Sinatra himself gives an understated performance but the set-piece involving the amputation is the tensest and best in the whole film, a minor acting masterclass from the star. Only Tommy Sands falls apart with a turn that could best be described as a caricature of a real person.",

      "reviewBody": "Not so much a musical as a mating call set to music. But then what else could be expected from three back-to-back production numbers from that carnally-obsessed choreographer Busby Berkeley. &quot;Beside the Waterfall&quot; alone has enough &apos;flowering o&apos;s&apos;, half-dressed chorines, and suggestive camera angles to make Hugh Hefner blush and send Dr. Freud into terminal overload. Then too, who else but the mad Mr. Berkeley could convert the complicated matter of sex into a mere conjugation of overhead geometry. There&apos;s also &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot;, a celebration of the no-tell motel, with marching phalanxes of hormonally driven couples all named Smith, and led by a demonic cupid looking like an early Billy Barty. The sight of his tiny legs chasing after a fleeing Amazon is enough to drive Harpo Marx to distraction and cause the audience to doubt the laws of physics. While bringing down the curtain is the marching madness of &quot;Shanghai Lil&quot;, where Berkeley proves-- in case you ever doubted-- that race, creed, and bad make-up make no difference to a Chinese bordello. It&apos;s sort of an early gathering of the UN, where people from all over come together to discuss the world&apos;s number one topic. All in all, there&apos;s enough sheer pizzaz, flash, and animal energy in these numbers to light up a thousand dark movie houses.\n\nSure, Warner Bros. tries to cover the orgy with the fig leaf of two cheerful innocents played by a sappy Dick Powell and a virginal Ruby Keeler. But it doesn&apos;t work, because everyone else gets in on the fun, including that human buzz-saw Jimmy Cagney and everyone&apos;s favorite sassy dame Joan Blondell. Director Lloyd Bacon proves too he knows what to do, giving us an eyeful of Blondell endlessly rolling and unrolling her hosiery, while the writers pepper the conversation with suggestive one-liners. Yeah, it&apos;s a great movie-- good enough to help bring down the heavy hand of censorship the following year, and put an end to damp dreams like &quot;Beside a Waterfall&quot;. But not even the Watchdogs of Public Morality could stop Berkeley&apos;s deliriously suggestive pageantry that would live on at even that most repressed of studios, MGM. Sure, Astaire-Rogers may have been more graceful and a whole lot more chaste, no doubt producing more sheer polish-- still and all, don&apos;t let this unabashedly pagan celebration pass you by. As they say around the owl cage, it&apos;s a real hoot."

      "reviewBody": "Ignore the way this old clunker is marketed on DVD and disregard the American title, &quot;Chamber of Horrors.&quot; There&apos;s nothing supernatural here and there are no Poe-like thrills. The &quot;horrors&quot; are a collection of old torture devices owned by the main villain, and they don&apos;t get much play. The English title gives you a better sense of the movie. You see, there&apos;s a door with seven locks which requires seven different keys. An heiress possesses the seventh key, and several unsavory characters will stop at nothing to get it from her.\n\nThe trappings of this mystery &quot;thriller&quot; are familiar nowadays mainly from comedies, parodies and cartoons. I especially liked that portrait with the real eyes peering out. I&apos;ve seen that countless times on &quot;Scooby Doo.&quot; Then there&apos;s the spooky tomb, secret panels in the wall, sinister servants and so on. Leslie Banks (probably best known for the original &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;) plays a flamboyant villain, sophisticated yet evil, complete with goatee, cape, a foreign accent of some kind and a pet monkey. This is one of the rare times I&apos;ve seen this stuff played straight – more or less.\n\nFortunately, this movie is no more self-serious than &quot;The Lady Vanishes.&quot; But don&apos;t expect any Hitchcockian suspense here. We have an excellent cast, headed by the beautiful Lilli Palmer and the amusing Banks. Lots of droll dialogue. (&quot;I love frolicking in morgues.&quot;) Lots of the aforementioned mystery trappings. But no suspense. The writers haven&apos;t the slightest idea how to grab our interest, much less keep it. The director betrays absolutely no flair for this kind of thing. It&apos;s all a leaden bore. Go watch &quot;Scooby Doo.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "SYNOPSIS The lives and loves of Russian Cossacks living on the eastern steps of Russia during the Russian Revolution.\n\nCONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER How events beyond our control and the judgment of others shape our lives in the long term. No matter how hard we try, sometimes fate controls our destiny.\n\nPROS AND CONS This is a great film, not because of it&apos;s acting or screenplay, but because it shows the western world that there were important events in the past that we have little knowledge of. It opens a doorway to us that we never knew existed and lets us glimpse some of the reasons that others think differently than we do.\n\nDuring the late 1950 the Soviet Union was keen to copy everything that the west did regarding popular culture to show that they could do it just as well as the Americans and the Europeans. They sort of had a chip on their shoulder and wanted to prove that they were good enough to run with the big boys. In response to films such as &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, they geared up their own state sponsored film industry to produce &apos;epics&apos;. This is one of them. Five and a half hours of the Russian experience in grand scope and scale.\n\nSome have said that this is the Russian version of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, but it is more closely tied to &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; in theme and tone. The film deals with a portion of history rarely seen in the west. The internal struggles of a nation in the midst of Civil War in what could best be described as the Wild West of Russia.\n\nThis film is long with slow pacing. Russian cinema does not move a story along at a fast pace. Characters are built slowly and relationships between them are complex and wide ranging. The scenery is beautiful but sparse, as befits the Russian hinterlands. This is mostly a rural &apos;people&apos; film, without much else to distract the audience, such as machinery or large scenes in cities. It is intimacy played out on a very broad canvas.\n\nOne of the more peculiar things about this version of the film is the narration. The film is shown in it&apos;s original language with no subtitles. The characters are narrated, not voiced over. So when someone speaks, it is in their native tongue, and then an English voice speaks what they are saying, sort of like you are reading their mind in delayed time. It preserves more of the feel of the film, but takes a little getting used to.\n\nThe other thing that was noticeable about the film was the Foley work. Sounds such as breaking glass or gun shots were VERY loud and distracted from the film at times. In a fist fight early in the film, the sounds of fists hitting the actors faces sounded like a sack of rice dropped from two stories up and hitting a wooden floor.\n\nUnless you watch this film very closely, without distraction, it is easy to get lost in the complexity of the story. I was often left wondering who were the Reds (Communists) were and who were the Whites (Loyalists) and who was fighting whom. This film assumes that the audience has a good understanding of this time in Russian history, much like most American audiences have a good understanding of who Benjamin Franklin and Paul Revere were.\n\nWhat this film left me with was a better understanding of the mind set of the Russian people and how they perceive their world and their place in it. They are pragmatic for a reason and see the journey of life as a hard and difficult thing. There is no &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; in their character. There is only finding happiness where it lays and enjoying it while you can.",

The jokes aren&apos;t all that funny either. Which puts this movie in a very grey in-between of being oddly watchable, yet unbearable all at the same time.\n\nFelt like a straight to streaming movie yet I saw it in a theater so props to the studio for that I suppose.

This is the first of three remarkable films director John Ford made about the United States Cavalry fighting Apache, Sioux, and Cheyenne. This film deals with topics such as leadership, responsibility, heroism, and legend, and one of the first films to present a more authentic and sympathetic view of Native Americans. It is characterised by a superb example of military academy officer stiffness and a martinet approach to soldiering; there is further interest is in his meeting a more organic Western community at the isolated outpost. The character, Lt. Col. Owen Thursday, was inspired by General George Armstrong Custer and his ill-fated stand at Little Big Horn. Immaculate and painstaking detail was given to the story&apos;s period and setting. Henry Fonda and John Wayne gave the drama vigour. Ford&apos;s direction achieved broad scope, employing a non-linear narrative using digressions from the main storyline to help produce the atmosphere of a military outpost, making the main theme about moral ambiguity in warfare powerful.",

      "reviewBody": "Some films have titles that are too good to be true. I mean, who doesn&apos;t want to see a cobra woman - a scaly half-human, half reptile with snake eyes and a flicking tongue? But this being a low-budget Filipino B-movie, we just know that what we&apos;ll get won&apos;t be that great. Sure enough, the titular creature is simply actress Marlene Clark with arms and legs coated in a thin layer of latex to make her skin look rough. Occasionally, she can be seen mid transformation with stupid looking large eyes slapped over her real peepers. The effect is terrible.\n\nOf course, a lousy monster can be easily forgiven if the story is great, but NOTCW fails big time there: the plot feels like it was made up as it went along, and is not going to be easy to summarise. I&apos;ll give you the gist...\n\nDuring WWII, nurse Lena Aruza (Clark) is bitten by the fabled Firebrand Cobra, endowing her with eternal youth, so long as she keeps herself topped up with venom. Decades later, and Lena is still going strong, her scaly pal Movini providing her with the necessary life-giving secretion. When UNICEF worker Joanna (Joy Bang) pays a visit to Lena, looking for help with making an anti-venom, she is turned away, so she sends her boyfriend Duff to see if he can have better luck (Roger Garrett). Quite the opposite... he&apos;s bitten by the Firebrand Snake, and only survives when Lena sucks out the poison.\n\nJoanna goes looking for Duff, and while waiting for Lena at her home, notices a sample of Firebrand venom in a pot, and so half-inches it and leaves. When Lena realises what Joanna has done, she sends her snake Movini after the girl, not reckoning on her having Duff&apos;s pet eagle Dirk with her. The eagle kills the snake, leaving Lena no option but to feed on the life-force of young men by having sex with them, starting with Duff...\n\nWhat follows is extremely sloppy storytelling, with zero concern for logic, terrible pacing, animal cruelty (a monkey is strapped to a table and snakes are killed) and very poor special effects, all leading to a downbeat ending in which Duff chooses to stay with Lena (who is in permanent snake form). Joanna walks away dejected, pausing to pluck a venom-infused mango from a tree.\n\nOn a &apos;scale&apos; of 1 to 10, I give thissssss a 3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the nudity (both Bang and Clark get naked for the camera), the hidden pig (I thought it was a rock, and then up it popped!) and for cult Filipino favourite Vic Diaz as a hideous hunchback.",

      "reviewBody": "That&apos;s the best way to describe this post war drama of a man, Bruno, who looks for vengeance for his brother&apos;s death at the hands of the Germans. He searches for the man who betrayed his brother.\n\nHis homecoming is riddled with the emotions one would expect, especially from those who have seen enough misery. Although most people seem to know the identity of the culprit, no one, not even Bruno&apos;s own family.\n\nAnd that&apos;s why the stark reality of these emotions are only for mature audiences. This is not for the sheltered naive kid who lives in a cubicle and thinks spaghetti Westerns make sense. This is for people who have &quot;been around the block&quot;, mature people who don&apos;t think it&apos;s normal to kill three men each morning before breakfast.\n\nAnd for those who think that makes it slow paced, it will be slow paced. However, for mature viewers it moves along at a very good pace. There is conflict, suspense and drama throughout that make it seem actually shorter than many modern movies that are allegedly action packed, but actually bore us to death.\n\nEnriching film, both in entertainment value, in learning about people, and in spirituality.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently was lucky enough to get to go to a screening of this film followed by a Q&amp;A with director Allen Coulter, stars Diane Lane and Adrien Brody; each one of which did a fantastic job in their most recent performances. Coulter&apos;s first foray into film is a very successful one. His abilities with the camera from his experience like The Sopranos is clear throughout and is very strong from the opening shot of LA as it swoops into the house as police enter the crime scene that is George Reeves home. The cinematography by Jonathan Freeman (&quot;Rescue Me&quot;, &quot;Taken&quot;) is very strong with a great contrast in shadows and a subtle yet noticeable difference between the two times shown in the film. Coulter also uses music and sound differences to establish the Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) and George Reeves (Ben Affleck) time lines as separated. The acting is all around amazing, Affleck and Brody take their characters and live them, both amazing. Affleck has a few moments where the Reeves voice seems to lapse slightly but it&apos;s nearly unnoticeable. Both near perfect performances and as for the rest of the cast, there is not a poor performance to be found in this film. Expect a SAG ensemble nomination here. The overall style of the film is very interesting. Coulter describes the film as a &quot;film noir in the daytime&quot; and a &quot;film about a modern man.&quot; The story is beautifully told with a nicely flowing back and forth between George Reeves life up until his death and &apos;independent investigator&apos; Simo&apos;s search for the truth about that fateful night. Overall the film gets a 9/10 from me because it was simply nearly flawless, I left the theater very happy for having seen it because I&apos;m willing to predict that this film will get some mentions come award time.",

This is an important documentary about an issue that is life and death for many people.\n\nIt actually deserves a slightly higher rating but there are no subtitles and even when an individual is not speaking English, no subtitles are provided. So quite a number of sections of the film are useless unless you happen to speak all the languages spoken in the film. Even many statements from the Nestles CEO are wasted in the film.\n\nNestles says its concerns are humanitarian, but as evidenced in the film, its only concern is money and making a profit. Once an area is dry, they move on to another area.",

      "name": "Post-apocalyptic &quot;Eli&quot; covers up weak plot with solid development and action",
      "reviewBody": "Everybody&apos;s talking about what happens after the apocalypse these days.  &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; is sort of the boiling point of this science-fiction  concept, a combination of last year&apos;s &quot;The Road&quot; and George Miller&apos;s  &quot;The Road Warrior.&quot; America is a post-apocalyptic wasteland and Denzel  Washington is the only self-sufficient badass. So originality is not  exactly &quot;Eli&apos;s&quot; calling card, but it clearly establishes its ruinous  world and the Hughes brothers (&quot;From Hell&quot;) take good care of its  characters while supplying top-notch action.  Washington stars as our stolid protagonist, Eli, journeying westward  with his canteen, a large machete, a couple guns and a special  leather-bound book. He lives on an Earth that was fried 30 years before  by the sun because of a war that ripped a hole through the ozone layer.  Sun-goggled bikers run amok pillaging, killing and raping passers-by,  yet Eli is morally sound and focused on keeping his book safe no matter  what so he can deliver it somewhere out west.  Although written by a first-time screenwriter and former PC Gamer  editor, Gary Whitta, &quot;Eli&quot; impressively creates its world between the  sunglasses/goggles due to the sun&apos;s power, trading of goods because  money&apos;s obsolete and the constant examining of hands to determine if  someone is jittery from eating too much human flesh. Whitta also places  Eli squarely in the story. He&apos;s a good but dangerous man who&apos;s not  afraid to kill, and as he sits idly by as a couple gets attacked, it&apos;s  abundantly clear that this is a world where compassion is secondary to  survival and self-interest.  Where the plot comes in is &quot;Eli&apos;s&quot; weak link. It doesn&apos;t try too hard  to hide just what exactly the book is and that sort of dissolves some  of the film&apos;s mystique. The plot is essentially Eli wants to protect it  and take it west and he has a run in with Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an  older man who runs a small town and desires it for selfish  power-related reasons. Along the way, anyone who threatens to lay a  hand on Eli gets sliced up or shot. In the two or three fight scenes  where he takes down numerous guys at once, you can&apos;t help but wonder  why after he kills the first few guys, the others don&apos;t run the hell  away, especially considering people are otherwise in self-preservation  mode living in a wasteland (and they know nothing of the book).  The Hughes brothers make those scenes worthwhile, however. There&apos;s a  style and grace to their action scenes -- they create a sort of a  moving tableau in some scenes and execute a wide range of tempos in the  action sequences to make them more intense. When Carnegie&apos;s men  encounter Eli and the young woman (Mila Kunis) that he inspires who  follows him at the home of some old folks (cameos by famous Brits  Frances De La Tour and Michael Gambon), they place the camera in the  middle of the action and sweep along with the gunfire (part- digitally)  from one side to the other. It&apos;s very cool and is an example of one way  the Hugheses keep the focus away from the plot&apos;s shaky skeleton. I only  have beef with their excessive slow-motion walking-toward-the-camera  shots and showing a bit too much of the cloudy green-gray sky.  Some people are going to be more surprised and impressed with the  film&apos;s big reveal than others, but anyone with a love of action and  that post-apocalyptic context will find something to make &quot;Eli&quot; a  worthwhile watch regardless of plot weakness. Washington is slightly  under-utilized but he&apos;s an ideal fit. He brings an intensity in his  demeanor that makes him an intriguing character and the film does a  good job of making his character more central than anything else.  ~Steven C",

      "reviewBody": "This is a fairly humorous story with decent special effects, especially considering it was made over 40 years ago. The key ingredient for success in this film was Veronica Lake. She&apos;s known more for her peekaboo blonde locks and for starring with Alan Ladd in several hit movies, but Lake was a good comedienne, too.\n\nSusan Hayward does well playing a snotty woman and Cecil Kellaway always plays an interesting character. Frederic March plays opposite Lake and I wish I hadn&apos;t read Lake&apos;s biography in which she explains how much she hated March. In made the love scenes lose a lot of impact when I learned how &quot;forced&quot; those scenes were.\n\nOh, well. It&apos;s still a nice, lightweight comedy, nothing special but entertaining for the most part.....but it helps to be a fan of Veronica Lake, which I am.",

      "reviewBody": "After having seen Schroeder&apos;s Idi Amin and Kiki the talking gorilla, I was disappointed by L&apos;avocat. From an artistic point of view it is not on the same level. I found it difficult to recognize the organizing, guiding hand of the director. Also, the subject is strangely out of focus  but that is maybe just one of the points the movie wants to make. Maître Vergès must be a pretty elusive fellow and certainly not someone who let himself manipulate by a movie maker. And - contrary to Amin and the gorilla - Vergès is just not very telegenic. That&apos;s certainly nobody&apos;s fault, it&apos;s just a fact.\n\nWhat remains for me are the many bonmots&quot; this movie contains. It did not become clear to me if Vergès ever was a good lawyer. I suspect he always saw the court of law principally as a stage for making political statements or for furthering a certain self image. But he certainly is a great story teller. My only war wound&quot;, he tells the interviewer, was self inflicted  I cut a finger when I closed my pocket knife after eating a dish of oysters&quot;. Mao listened to me attentively  or maybe he just wanted to be polite.&quot; It is fun to listen to him telling these anecdotes and being disrespectful, even to himself. Many, maybe too many other people make their entrance as interviewees. Even for someone who has a notion of the last few decades of world history it is not always easy to follow.\n\nSaying all this, I have to credit the movie for forming a pattern of statements, places and time periods that recount events which brought a lot of pain and sorrow to this planet. The central question - is Maître Vergès a man with a cause? - remains unanswered. Somehow he shifted from one liberation movement&quot; to the next, maybe connected to secret services, maybe not - his aims apparently as fuzzy as those of the said movements - never drowning like others but always ending up seemingly comfortably on the surface. It is never clear how much Vergès was a prime mover on the terrorist scene or a teleguided pawn. After seeing this movie I would liken him to a joker in a pack of cards.\n\nSomeone not very deep into history might be surprised at how L&apos;avocat shows that there were always connections and sympathies between old, active Nazis and young, seemingly leftist revolutionaries. Others know the old French saying: Les extrèmes se touchent.",

The major project of the expedition is the mapping of the ocean floor using advanced sonar, but in between the crew stays busy exploring the ocean and occasionally &apos;interfering&apos; with the habits of the local sea creatures.\n\nYou&apos;d never see this kind of disrespectful attitude in a National Geographic docu today and in a way it&apos;s kind of refreshing to see that these guys are not infallible.\n\nOne note to those with sensitive stomachs, there is a scene where the Calypso &apos;accidentally&apos; runs over a baby whale and the resulting wound turns the ocean bright red forcing the crew to capture the whale and administer a &apos;kill shot&apos; in order to put it out of it&apos;s misery.\n\nParents might want to think twice about bringing kids to see this rather graphic look at ocean research and some of its inherent dangers.",

      "reviewBody": "That alternate title for Masculin Feminin, The Children of Marx and Coca-Cola, is provided in the middle of the film. It is probably the most famous thing from it. It&apos;s actually a good title. Politics and pop culture mix in odd ways in the film, and the characters are uncertain about both of those aspects of their lives. \n\nTruth be told, Masculin Feminin is a lesser work by Jean-Luc Godard. It was made during a difficult period in his life: his relationship with Anna Karina, his wife and favorite actress, star of many of his early films such as Le petit soldat, Une femme est une femme, and especially Vivre sa vie, was falling apart. Therefore, this particular film is very bitter and hopeless. Godard is also unsure of where he&apos;s going. The film stars Jean-Pierre Leaud, who is most famous for playing Antoine Doinel in such Truffaut films as The 400 Blows. His girlfriend is played by Chantal Goya, who was a pop star at the time (and she plays an up-and-coming pop singer in the film). The film loses track of its supporting players. They are omnipresent, but when they have scenes without Leaud or Goya, the film gets tedious. Godard doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s doing with them. This is especially true of a long scene where Leaud&apos;s best friend tries to court Goya&apos;s best friend in a kitchen. He asks her many questions, but they are all very trite ones about her sex life. I swear, he asks the same three questions a dozen times each. It gets old fast, and the scene lasts forever. There are several good sequences, but nothing that really equals the best of Jean-Luc Godard. Perhaps its real value is in its editing. Godard&apos;s editing is always interesting, and Masculin Feminin shows us his skill with long takes. Also, there are a couple of great tracking shots. 7/10.",

The former Akira warrior Zed (Jeff Corey) advises that they should hire mercenaries to protect them from Sador and offers his spaceship to seek them out. However, the Akira can only pay with food and lodging. The young Shad (Richard Thomas) offers to pilot the ship with the computer Nell to look for mercenaries. He meets Dr. Hephaestus (Sam Jaffe) and his beautiful daughter Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel) in a space station where he unsuccessfully tries to find weapon. Nanelia comes with Shad and he teams up with the earthling Cowboy (George Peppard), who was going to deliver weapons to a planet that was destroyed by Sador and offers to give them to Shad. Then he meets five clones that share the mind of one entity called Nestor that join him. Shad also recruits the lonely and wealthy assassin Gelt (Robert Vaughn) that accepts the proposed payment. Then the sexy and annoying Valkyrie warrior St. Exmin (Sybil Danning) joins the group since she wants to battle. Shad also recruits Cayman (Morgan Woodward) that wants to kill Sador and does not require any payment. They return to Akir and Sador also returns to attack the planet. Who will win the battle?\n\n&quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; is an enjoyable cult movie with a story based on &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and its remake &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; but in space. Inclusive the Akira is a tribute to Akira Kurosawa. &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; reuses material from other films (&quot;Space Raiders&quot;, &quot;Starquest II&quot;, &quot;Dead Space&quot; and &quot;Bachelor Party&quot;); the acting is only reasonable; and the special effects, sets and costumes are poor. But who cares? My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Mercenários das Galáxias&quot; (&quot;Mercenaries of the Galaxies&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This is a stunningly visual film which takes many of the best elements of the minor sub-genre of 1980s and 1990s sci-fi involving virtual reality, and blends them into an interesting story exploring social withdrawal, addiction, the nature of reality, and the value of life. The film does have a bit of new wave pretentiousness to it - using cliché hacker-names for the players of Avalon, etc, but no more so than many of its competitors (and a bit less than The Matrix). If this sort of thing doesn&apos;t appeal to you - and especially if you&apos;re the type who wants a film to simply entertain and tell you a simple story, don&apos;t bother to read any further.\n\nThe film uses a story-telling technique common in good literature but unfortunately under-used in film - that of intentional ambiguity. The best example of this is the main character - well played by Malgorzata Foremniak. You simply don&apos;t know what to make of &quot;Ash&quot;. Though I found it easy to relate to this character, and I think I understand her, I am not sure most viewers will. In my opinion, Ash is best interpreted as a person with an iron-clad grip on reality, who nevertheless maintains a distance from the people around her, and prefers to keep her relationships &quot;in-game&quot;. This is not at all an uncommon personality type, especially among women and mature males in the real worlds of virtual reality and on-line gaming.\n\nThe film focuses on Ash&apos;s ambitions to become the best player of Avalon - an ultra-real and sometimes deadly virtual reality game - in the world. Avalon is illegal and run on LANs which are set up in what looks like futuristic crack houses. To become recognized as the best, Ash has to complete a level which tends to put anybody who enters it into a catatonic state. She comes to believe that an old team mate of hers - Murphy - inhabits that zone, and wants to rescue him. But of course the designers of the game have other plans, and maybe Murphy himself does as well. Foremniak does a great job of playing this ambiguous yet sympathetic character. Ash, the carefully developed script, the excellent soundtrack, and the superb and beautiful visual effects, all keep you guessing until the very end. I never knew what to expect from this film, and I was very pleased by the way it developed its own concepts of logic and justice - remaining centered on Ash throughout.\n\nAvalon was interesting enough for a second and perhaps a third viewing. I will update my review (if needed) after my next round with it. For now, I will only give it a very high recommendation to anybody who has read this far. After all, if you&apos;ve read this far in the review, you&apos;re probably interested enough in the film to see it.",

While shopping supplies in a local store, Megan befriends the seller Nick (Tyler Hoechlin) and buys a magazine with an article about communication with the dead in the summer solstice, the time of year when there is the greatest length of daylight. While in her house, Megan is haunted by a spirit that she believes is Sofie trying to communicate with her. In her investigation, she suspects of the weird hick Leonard (R. Lee Ermey) and while snooping in his house, she finds the picture of the missing girl Malin (Jenna Hildebrand) and unravels a dark secret about the suicide of her sister.\n\nThe low-budget &quot;Solstice&quot; was a great surprise with a consistent story, solid screenplay and good acting. The original story startles in many moments without gore, and the young team of gorgeous actresses and handsome actors has great performances. I was expecting to see another slasher teen horror movie and found a pleasant surprise. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

This film was really funny! So funny, that I&apos;m wondering if the people who say they hated it actually saw the same film. No, its not fine art, its a summer comedy, and it delivers plenty of laughs. I am middle-aged guy whose not into early Adam Sandler, or Napoleon Dynamite type comedies, and this movie had me laughing hard. Sure, not at every single joke, but at most of them. If you are into absurdest humor, or enjoyed movies like Hot Fuzz, or Super Troopers, you&apos;ll find plenty to enjoy. P.S. My wife liked it too.",

We also get lots of gratuitous nudity from the statuesque Erika Anderson, who&apos;s married to Judge Reinhold (fairly good, but not good enough to be taken absolutely seriously as a dramatic actor yet) and pursued by Nicolas Cage (in a smug performance he would probably like to forget today). Overall, not a horrible film, but not outstanding, either. (**)",

      "reviewBody": "Blue, directed by Anthony D&apos;souza is a brainless, forgettable action-thriller that quickly sinks without a trace. Let me say this right away: anyone expecting anything other than the sight of Lara Dutta in a skimpy bikini, or indeed Akshay Kumar with his shirt off, is going to be very disappointed. The film&apos;s hare-brained plot involves a coveted treasure buried at the bottom of the ocean, and a reluctant Sanjay Dutt playing Sagar, a working class, regular-Joe in the Bahamas who refuses to seek it out even though he seems to be the only diver in the world who knows where and how to find it. No amount of coaxing from his friend and employer Aarav (played by Akshay Kumar) will do the trick. But the out-of-shape Dutt – whose unsightly man-boobs suggest he&apos;s been bunking too many sessions at the gym – finally agrees to take the plunge when his kid-brother&apos;s life depends on it. Sam (played by Zayed Khan wearing a single expression throughout) is in trouble with some goons who must be paid $50 million immediately. For a film that&apos;s titled Blue, most of the action here involves bike chases and car explosions, while the underwater portions are gorgeously filmed but evoke no real excitement. To be honest, in fact, the tension never heightens to the point where you worry about the protagonists. How can you, when you notice even the sharks are swimming peacefully around them, oblivious and uninterested even when underwater brawls result in blood being spilt! Blue suffers from a dull script and inane dialogue, and is cursed with characters that are as shallow as the waters they paddle. You want to burst into laughs when Lara Dutta (playing Sagar&apos;s girlfriend Mona) slips into Miss India mode and complains that they have no money to realise her one dream of setting up a marine research facility. The lady does not show so much as a passing interest in fish, by the way! Coming back to the business of the buried fortune, let&apos;s just say we&apos;ve all participated in school treasure-hunts that were more challenging than this one. We&apos;re told the fortune hasn&apos;t been retrieved in 60 years, and yet Sagar leads the way to the loot as if it&apos;s lying in his backyard. Neither slick nor fast-paced, this film lumbers in circles before crashing into a moronic finale involving ridiculous back-stories about dead family members. In the end, despite its travel-brochure look that might afford some momentary National Geographic-style relief, Blue doesn&apos;t have a shred of intelligence, and it sinks in a sea of lame writing and laughable performances. Sanjay Dutt sleepwalks through his scenes, and Akshay Kumar overdoes the smugness. As for Zayed Khan, how I wish the makers had spent the fee they paid him to hire a few more sharks and include a few more thrills instead. The music by AR Rahman is strictly average; even the item song by Kyle Minogue can&apos;t save this film from reaching its watery grave.Director Anthony D&apos;souza&apos;s Blue&apos;s has flashy exterior and it&apos;s one dead fish. Watch it strictly at your own risk.",

The plot has holes, direction, too, and yet something keeps you interested in watching this movie. Martin plays the villain, against type; he commands a troop of convincing heavies; Peppard comes into town, the silent fellow who ends up restoring order. ROUGH NIGHT is pleasant enough, with some quirky touches, like Martin telling Peppard to bury one of his henchmen, the poker game between the two, and a whipping of Peppard that brings to mind Marlon Brando&apos;s in ONE-EYED JACKS.",

      "name": "Notable Paella/Spaghetti Western well directed by Joaquin Romero Marchent , including thrills , intrigue , crossfire and plot twists",
      "reviewBody": "Cool Spaghetti full of drama , suspense , fury , action, and portentous duels . This is a surprisingly low-key Paella Western compellingly written and directed by Joaquin Romero that will appeal to traditional and American-style westerns more than those following the peculiar Leone wake . After commiting a bank heist by Frank (Jesus Puente) and Martin (Jose Bodalo) and betraying his partner , resulting in Frank is incarcerated , and then Martin becomes a wealthy owner . In a desert region , Martin , bound to a wheelchair , is served by a gang of desperados (Luigi Pistilli , Carlos Romero Marchent, Gaspar Indio Gonzalez) to collect rents and murder anybody who resists . Then Lassiter (Robert Hundar) arrives , telling Martin that he knows where Frank is, the man who made him a cripple by shooting on back . As Martin seeks vengeance against the thief colleague who cowardly crippled him . Nowadays , Frank lived easily in a ranch undertaking a peaceful life .\n\nSpaghetti with Chorizo Western crammed with thrills , drama , shoot em&apos; up , killings and and particular roles seeking bloody vendetta , an usual plot in Spaghetti/Paella Western . An Italian-Spanish co-production full of emotion , exaggerated characters , shootouts , twists and turns . Decent Tortilla Western well starred by the Italian Robert Hundar and compellingly directed by Rafael Marchent . This is an agreeable as well as attractive Paella Western , pre-Sergio Leone , and packs violence , shootouts , high body-count , dramatic happenings , being fast moving and quite entertaining . Joaquin Romero Marchent creates some good action scenes and moving set pieces . It&apos;s an exciting and thrilling western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Robert Hundar against several enemies. The notorious Spaghetti/Paella actor , Robert Hundar -actual name : Claudio Undari- is good in his usual tough role , here playing an elegant and roguish gunman , become into a terrible but sympathetic avenger . His role bears remarkable resemblance to posterior Sartana , as an amoral anti-hero. He&apos;s not out there to catch the baddies , as he&apos;s just out for money and blood . His quirky gadgets often bring to mind the other Gianfranco Parolini character, Sabata . At the beginning his career , Robert Hundar acted as an extra but Italian westerns soon followed in minor roles . He once reportedly missed out on a role in a Franco Nero western because his height made Franco Nero look too short , he soon moved into other film genres playing good guys , bad guys , and good-bad guys . As he performed several Ravioli Westerns , such as : ¨Cut-throats nine¨, ¨Antes Llega La Muerte¨ , ¨Con Lui Cavalca La Morte¨ , ¨Un Hombre , Un colt¨ , ¨Dakota Joe¨, ¨Ramon El Mexicano¨ , ¨Brandy¨ , among others . His main enemy is rightly performed by José Bodalo as a cruelly baddie role is terrific , he acted in the classic ¨Django¨ subsequently would play similar characters . Furthermore, there appears usual Italian/Spanish Western support actors , a largely secondary cast plenty with Spanish/Italian secondaries , but more Spanish players than Italian ones , all of them ordinary in Chorizo western , such as José Bódalo , Jesús Puente , Francisco Sanz , Luigi Pistilli , Roberto Camardiel , Aldo Sambrell , Benito Stefanelli ,Gaspar &apos;Indio&apos; González , Luis Gaspar , Emilio Rodriguez , Luis Prendes , among others , though there sadly lacks the great Fernando Sancho . Furthermore , Carlos Romero Marchent who is brother of Joaquin and Rafael Romero Marchent , here playing an important role as adopted son of José Bodalo . Adequate photography by Rafael Pacheco , being necessary a right remastering because of the film copy is washed out , filmed on location in Las Rozas , Manzanares Del Real , La Pedriza , Madrid and , of course , Desert of Tabernas , Almeria . And being accompanied by an agreeable musical score by Marcello Giombini , including catching .\n\nThe movie was produced in enough budget by the notorious Alberto Grimaldi who produced the famous ¨Dollars trilogy¨ by Leone and previoulsy financed various Paella Western usually directed by Joaquin Marchent . Here delivering a simple pre-Leone-style Western with nice performances and fine filmmaking. Being professionally directed and in his own personal style by Joaquin Romero Marchent who was the first to shoot Westerns in Spain , along with his brother Rafael Romero Marchent . The craftsman Joaquin Marchent is deemed the Paella Western&apos;s best director , his first film was ¨El Coyote¨ and the sequel titled ¨Revenge of Coyote¨ shot in Mexico ; after that , he filmed ¨The shadow of Zorro¨ and ¨Revenge of Zorro¨, he went go directing Western as ¨ Riding to death ¨ , ¨Adventures in the West¨ , ¨Three good men¨, ¨Sabor Venganza ¨ and the most popular and violent ¨Condenados a Vivir¨ . Plus , he wrote for his brother Rafael Romero Marchent the following Westerns : ¨Manos Torpes¨, ¨Ocaso Un Pistolero¨ , ¨Garringo¨ , ¨Dos Cruces en Danger Pass¨ and ¨Sartana Kills Them All¨. Rating : 7/10 .Passable and decent Chorizo Western , though contains a few flaws and gaps ; however , it results to be entertaining and enjoyable .",

      "reviewBody": "Four men and a lady blast off for the red planet Mars in this lean-budgeted but likable little yarn.  The explorers find a thriving civilization of completely humanoid Matians.  The leaders of the Martian government act friendly, but they secretly plot to kill the Earthlings and steal the secret of their rocket propulsion system.\n\nScientist Arthur Franz (`Invaders from Mars&apos;) is the leader of the expedition, Cameron Mitchell is the wisecracking newspaper man, and Virginia Houston is Franz&apos;s jilted fiancé&apos;.  Mitchell fall in love with Miss Houston, and Franz falls in love with a gorgeous Martian lady in a minidress, played by Marguerite Chapman, the heroine of  `Spy Smasher&apos; -- one of the Republic serials which Lucas and Speilberg patterned `Raiders of the Lost Ark&apos; after.\n\nDirector Lesley Selander shot the picture in just 11 days, and admirable accomplishment in view of the results.  After all, it was made in 1951 (the same year as `The Thing&apos; and `The Day the Earth Stood Still&apos;) in glorious Cinecolor, and the set designs are remarkably similar to those used in `This Island Earth&apos;.  I read somewhere (`Starlog&apos; magazine, I think&apos;) that the sets and special effects were by the same people.\n\nThe costumes are excellent, especially those worn by the attractive female stars (extremely short, `futuristic&apos; dresses).  Also noteworthy is the fact that we get to see Morris Ankrum in his second sci-fi role (the first was `Rocketship X-M&apos;).  He portrays a general, as he did in so many 1950s sci-fi films -- but this time he&apos;s a MARTIAN general who urges his people to invade the Earth!\n\nA lovely irony for 1950s sci-fi fans.\n\nThe highly appealing rocket in `Flight to Mars&apos; was reused in at least three other 1950s movies -- `Queen of Outer Space&apos;, `World Without End&apos;, and `It ! The Terror from Outer Space&apos;.  And that makes this rocket the most well-traveled interplanetary vehicle in film history, second only to the Millennium Falcon!\n\nIf you&apos;ve got  a soft spot for 1950s films, this one will warm the your heart if you can find it.  Lemme&apos; know if you do."

      "reviewBody": "10 MPH is great fun and heart-warming. If you&apos;re a city dweller, you deserve a taste of what the rest of the US is like. The only thing better than actually seeing this film is that you can&apos;t help being happy for the filmmakers that they got to put their vision, talents, and sense of adventure to such good use. They embody this line from Howard Thurman, &quot;Don&apos;t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.&quot; \n\nOne thing that really made me want to see 10 MPH was this comment by Sam Chaffos, Documentaries Programing Director for the 2006 Vail Film Festival: &quot; . . . the moving experience shown in your film transcends the screen and infects the audience in a way that I don&apos;t know can be properly expressed through words. Maybe it&apos;s just where I happen to be in my own life at the moment, but I doubt it. The deft editing and subtle power of the courage, friendship, humour, and adventure conveyed in 10 mph is unlike almost any documentary I&apos;ve seen, and I thank you personally for exposing so much. It amounts to an unbelievably powerful piece of art.&quot;",

And of course being a priest while being &quot;naughty&quot; exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.\n\nIf you have seen Wook&apos;s previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath. And when that boils, quite a few bad things start to happen. But through all that dark, there also moments of light (fun) to be had too. A very stylistic and though provoking movie, that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...",

Yes that is a part of the tradition of the series from both manga and anime, however, the point is sorely missed by those who are simply looking for a bloodbath and base entertainment.\n\nHokuto no Ken is about personal responsibility, hope and standing up for what a person values. This new movie keeps with that theme and further explores characters who were not fully developed in the series. It expands upon relationships which were glossed previously. The subtitle for the anime translates to murdered love story. By retelling the parts of the story which it does it shows how the main character&apos;s brother murdered love in his heart and provides a parallel with the villain, Souther showing the fruit of murdered love and how it leads one to destruction and doom. This movie is an excellent piece of storytelling and my only complaint is that Souther&apos;s back story was removed, taking away from his depth as a character.",

Aside from the rather frightening look into the current world of holocaust denial and pro Hitler ideology, the contents of the film were used as evidence to secure a court conviction. Gil Sedan filed this report from Bonn, for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, on September 8, 1995. &quot;A neo-Nazi leader whose life was the subject of a documentary has been sentenced by a Berlin court to 3-1/2 years in jail. Bela Ewald Althans, 29, was convicted of racist incitement, defamation and holocaust denial in connection with the film, Profession: Neo-Nazi&quot; [Beruf Neonazi].\n\nNo connection has been proven between the film and the &quot;torching&quot; of Ernst Zundel&apos;s Toronto headquarters, which were featured in the film, but his centre for operations did sustain heavy fire damage, only to be rebuilt as a fortress behind iron fence and heavily monitored by internal closed circuit cameras!\n\nOverall, the film awakened me to my own ignorance of the vast extent and fervor of today&apos;s neonazi movement.",

      "reviewBody": "This enlightening, competently investigated and imperative documentary with a fantastic opening titles sequence seizes the various health and environmental concerns associated with the privatization of water. Bottled water corporations make masses of proceeds every year, but are they entitled to exhaust a small town&apos;s water supply without previous permission and without restoring it? Fryebyrg, Maine, endured a water famine while, in tandem, Coca-Cola continued to pump their already deficient supply. It&apos;s revealed that the bottled water industry is unregulated and causes health hazards. Tap water, however, is thoroughly regulated. Municipalities test water for toxins nonstop every day.\n\nDirector Stephanie Soechtig jabs acutely at the predicament of water with specific and vital insights, eschewing disproportionate use of talking heads. For instance, I feel like I should&apos;ve already known that the Pacific has a portion overflowing with plastic. Numerous corporations employ the chemical BPA to make their bottles, a neurotoxin that potentially causes various neurological disorders. There&apos;s no denying that any and every form of growth are all endangered when science and law mingle with misinformation and materialism. At least documentaries like Tapped appear every so often to nurture awareness, to notify the people and clear the daze of party lines. Whether or not Tapped will help to heal the public&apos;s indifference toward progress and environmental causes is a different affair.\n\nTapped does to bottled water manufacturing what Food, Inc. and Super Size Me did to food monopolies. It&apos;s an exposé of champion reporting. Some will likely put the propaganda label on Tapped however, and one could split those hairs, insomuch as it&apos;s predisposed to a certain alliance. But the information is indisputable, unlike the propaganda of today that functions to make us believe what its makers don&apos;t believe themselves. Tapped joins the crusade to battle corporate Goliaths who have milked local water supplies to sell it in toxic bottles, sometimes during droughts that constrain towns to rigorously limit their own water use.\n\nWe&apos;re first brought to Fryeburg, where one day, their standard of living is as it&apos;s been for generations, and the next day enormous trucks roll in. Without any prior communication, Nestle just silently procured land to tap for water, and since then they&apos;ve been rolling those trucks in and out, extracting from the local spring but paying no taxes to recover the community. And unlike other trades, they&apos;re not even required to purchase resources to make their product, save for those plastic bottles, made by petroleum factories with cancer-causing constituents.\n\nAll effective modern documentaries seem to need statistical facts presented in graphic design effects to give their allegations a source. And in an age of instant gratification, they must. Conservative Libertarians want to know what&apos;s wrong with someone making a buck? Well, just 1% of the water that envelops 75% of the planet is drinkable. A year before this documentary was finished, there was a drought in 35 of 50 States. No water, no life. The first words said in Tapped are, &quot;By 2030, two-thirds of the world will not have access to clean drinking water.&quot;\n\nDuring a Raleigh drought, Pepsi kept hauling over 400,000 gallons a day. How are such reckless actions possible in a democracy? Well, the FDA, we gather from intense footage of Senate hearings, relies on tests run by the companies themselves! Meanwhile, one FDA pen-pusher is accountable for supervision of the entire industry. Put in close-up and faced with facts, we ultimately even hear the FDA publicist telling Soechtig that if he&apos;d known this was the course the interview was to take, he wouldn&apos;t have agreed to grant the interview. Why does the FDA even need a publicist?\n\nA visit to Corpus Christi familiarizes us with residents who live within miles of the factory producing the plastic bottles used by the big three water manufacturers. All have health troubles. The more you watch, the more scared and livid you become. American industry has been reduced to a criminal kingdom over the last thirty years, but the bottled water industry has clearly avoided greater scrutiny. Hopefully, that&apos;s changing. It all boils down to water as a rudimentary birthright, a raw material owned by us all. If you begin commodifying bare essentials of life in such a way as to make it harder for people to get to them, you have the footing for grave political volatility.",

I drive people nuts when I point out faults in this or that. With that being said, I can SEE where some might find fault with some of the particular errors in this film (i.e. the lack of helmets) but to be truthful, though I am ONE OF THEM, I was so caught up in the intensity of this film, I didn&apos;t even notice the irregularities.\n\nThis film IS intense and very well acted. I literally was on the edge of the couch I usually lay back on while watching movies and it takes a fair amount to get me on that edge.\n\nLebanon may not be perfect, but it&apos;s perfectly good. I could find no fault with it and didn&apos;t even try. It sucks you in from the minute it starts. The very fact that you NEVER LEAVE THE TANK is amazing. If you are even remotely claustrophobic, maybe you shouldn&apos;t watch this movie. You might be in your own home in a spacious room with windows and everything, but once you get into this movie, you feel like you&apos;re with the crew and they won&apos;t let you out until the end.\n\nI won&apos;t say more primarily because, as simple as the story line is, it&apos;s a complex movie and to say much, would say TOO much."

This movie drew a lump to my throat the size of a golf ball and made me hug my son extra hard at bedtime. Michelle Williams gives another outstanding performance and Ewan MacGregor is, as always, a complete pleasure to watch on screen. This film will come out on DVD this year and I would urge anyone with a heart to embrace it.",

      "name": "Splendid  film  dealing with SS lieutenant Kurt Gerstein attempts  to inform Pope Pius XII about Jews being sent to concentration camps and massacred",
      "reviewBody": "Thoughtful and brooding film with excellent interpretations and horrible events . The picture talks an officer Gestapo named Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur) in charge of Zyklon B , a deadly chemical gas used for killing Jews in the death&apos;s showers from concentration camps as Treblinka , Sorbibor , Auschwitz , Majanek , Manthausen ,.... , Gerstein contacts a Jesuit priest (Mathieu Kassovitz) who&apos;s related to a Vatican Cardenal (Michael Duchaussoy) and his father results to be Pope&apos;s assistant . He denounces and explains Pope Pio XII (Marcel Iures) the situation of the Jews&apos;s genocide .\n\nThe pic is correctly based on historic deeds and famous personages as Pio XII and Nazi chiefs who don&apos;t appear in the film but they&apos;re continuously named as Goering , Goebbles , Himmler , Eichmann ,thus as notorious events as Stalingrado (1943) where Nazis have the first important defeat and the bombing strikes over the Germany cities (Berlin , Dresde) . The movie is based on a play by German playwright Rolf Hochhuth which started a lot of heated discussions and arguments after its first release in 1963. The film blends drama , tension , historical events and in spite of the runtime is two hours and some isn&apos;t boring , nor dreary but happens enough interesting deeds . The Vatican did not give a permission to shoot the film in their buildings. After searching a scenery of adequate size for the scenes taking place in the Vatican, Costa-Gavras finally chose Europe&apos;s largest building, the House of the People in Bucharest . Some of the outdoor scenes were shot in Mogosoaia Palace, some fourteen kilometers northwest of Bucharest. The movie attained quite polemic but there&apos;s an accusation to Catholic Church for passivity on the crimes and mass slaughter . I really think that didn&apos;t have but lack of forecast . The motion picture was well directed by Constantine Costa Gravas who at all his films always gets controversy and dispute . Rating : Above average . Well worth seeing .",

As its predecessor, &quot;Tiovivo&quot; has virtually no plot, and limits itself to representing the lives of a bunch of people in the Madrid of the post-war era. \n\nThe cast is simply impressive, it looks like just any actor who was available was summoned by Garci to star in his film. However, we would have liked to see a bit more of some actors who appear in little more than glorified cameos (Fernando Fernán Gómez, Ana Fernández or Beatriz Rico, to name just a few). There are some extremely fine performances from the likes of Alfredo Landa, Tina Sáinz, Andrea Tenuta or, surprisingly enough, Elsa Pataky and Francis Lorenzo. All of them make the most of their bit parts in this ensemble piece, but the heart and soul of the picture is Aurora Bautista, who plays a destitute woman who sells religious stamps.\n\nTaking into account that the movie has virtually no plot, there is no apparent reason to make a two-hour-and-a-half movie. There are so many great stories, but I couldn&apos;t help to wonder whether the film would have benefited if Garci had kept a few of them for a further project. The eventual result is overlong, and definitely not as good as &quot;You&apos;re the one&quot; or &quot;Historia de un beso&quot;, but it is still worth a watch if only for the great performances. \n\nOverall rating: 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "James Miller goes to the Palestine territory to film the children of the Intifada and is killed by Israeli firepower. His murder is a stunning coda to a filmed account of how war corrupts the innocence of children. Miller begins the film acquainting us with the geography of Palestine, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip. We meet, get up close and personal, with the battle hardened &quot;martyrs&quot; of the Hamas jihad. Hidden by masks they seduce the children, so needy for heroes and mentors, with speeches of death and destruction. Blow yourself up and go to paradise. We meet the children, feckless, disingenuous children learning to kill, feeling the heft of a gun, basking in the praise of the masked warriors. There are the girls, praying for the destruction of Israel, eager to emulate their male counterparts. The children seduce us with their wide-eyed appeal, their ability to absorb the most horrible blows as their homes are destroyed. One child points to his uncle&apos;s car which has been tossed into the limbs of a tree by an Israeli bulldozer that&apos;s just leveled his home. The children watch all this, relate the stories of the martyrs, and seem with their open faces and fetching smiles and flashing dark eyes not to have a clue that they&apos;re living in a hell. They express the earnest belief that all will be well once the Israelis are (1) killed and (2)removed from the area between the Mediteranean and the Sea of Galilee. The innocence and naiveté are beguiling, disturbing, sad. At the last Miller meets his brutal, surprising death in the murky dusk, in the rubble of the streets of this hopeless settlement. There seems no way out. Violence begets violence. The righteous shriek their slogans. Human life is disposable. This brilliant film solves nothing. Don&apos;t believe me? Read the viewers&apos; comments on the Message Boards. Read the insults, the disparaging remarks, the certitude of bigots and believers. James Miller. R.I.P. All the innocent children of Gaza. R.I.P. (And today I read of the death of journalists from U.S. TV in Iraq. When will it end?)",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m of the opinion that out of all the movie stars and would-be movie  stars in Hollywood, Denzel Washington is one of, if not THE, safest  bet. I say this because I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever met a person who  dislikes the man. In a culture that is built upon strong opinions and  holding to said opinions fiercely (this is the backbone of the industry  in many ways), it is a remarkable feat to put together a 20+ year  career like Denzel has without drawing the ire of someone or some  group. Age, race, and gender seem to matter not when it comes to  Denzel, whose films almost always find a way to exceed expectations  whether they are magnificent (Training Day, American Gangster) or  wholly lackluster (John Q, Unstoppable). There is an overriding sense  among a high percentage of moviegoers that if Denzel is in, so are  they. Safe House, a solid if uninspired action thriller, has proved  this theory to be true.   Instead of the undercover investigations and shoot outs he expected  when he joined the CIA, Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) has been relegated  to manning a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. He is bored and he  wants some action, a desire that is all too well fulfilled at the  outset of the film when former CIA agent-turned-traitor Tobin Frost  (Washington) is brought to his house for interrogation. Soon after his  arrival, a militant force arrives to take possession of Frost, killing  the highly-trained team that brought Frost into the house. With no  other option, Weston grabs Frost and makes a bolt for it, barely  escaping the unknown villains who killed his comrades. With no other  teams in the area, Weston&apos;s superior, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson),  tasks him with keeping Frost alive and in custody until he can be  collected, a proposition which turns out to be much more difficult and  complex than Weston would have ever imagined. With the assailants hot  on their trail and Frost crawling deeper and deeper in Weston&apos;s head,  the young agent must think fast and learn on the run before he becomes  another casualty of a dirty battle that Frost has sucked him into.  There are a few departures from the main storyline at work within Safe  House but these distractions are only there to lengthen the film and  add some uninteresting depth. This film lives and dies on the  performances of Reynolds and Washington, both of whom come through  beautifully. It&apos;s been a rough year for Reynolds whose star status has  been thrown into serious question with the failures of Green Lantern  and The Change-Up. This role, however, is a better fit for him,  allowing him to share the load with an established genre veteran  instead of being relied upon to carry a major film on his own. I was  pleasantly surprised at his ability to give Weston more depth than what  you usually get with this sort of film and I thought he hit the right  balance between being a half- terrified, inexperienced field agent and  being that hardened, &quot;see this thing through to the bitter end&quot;  character that Safe House had to have. Washington, meanwhile, is a tour  de force, exuding both charisma and menace in just the right amounts.  Always a commanding presence on the screen no matter what his role,  Washington is at his best when delivering his lines in that quiet,  calm, measured manner which he has become famous for and this is a role  that calls upon that ability several times. I can&apos;t say that this is  one of Washington&apos;s best portrayals and it&apos;s certainly a safer choice  than I&apos;d like to see an actor of his caliber make, but it is  nonetheless a reminder of exactly why just about everybody digs what  this guy has been selling for two decades.   Every other element of Safe House plays second fiddle to the work done  by the two leads. The action is intense and somewhat gritty; when a  shot is fired, you feel it as much as hear it, a characteristic I quite  like in a serious action film. The plot itself is rife with  generalities and clichés, making the film about as paint-by-numbers as  they come. Personally, though, I didn&apos;t get caught up in these  half-hearted missteps too often. Better choices could certainly be  made; the major &quot;twist&quot; could be seen from a mile away and the  conclusion was unsatisfactory for me. But given director Daniel  Espinosa&apos;s relative inexperience behind the camera and the sheer power  of Washington&apos;s star appeal, these are issues I found easy to overlook  as the film progressed. It&apos;s nothing new and it&apos;s not a film I want to  watch a dozen times over but for what it is, Safe House provides an  entertaining and appealing experience.",

Despair at the loss of a loved one, either through death, divorce or disinterest. Knowing that going in and if you don&apos;t mind downbeat films there are some really moving performances from a cast full of legends.\n\nHeavy with gloom there is still much too admire though Miller&apos;s prose is at times heavy and tending towards pretension. Marilyn&apos;s woozy sexuality coming through a haze of pills and booze at times still suits her character&apos;s searching and displaced loneliness. \n\nClark Gable accepted his part after first choice Robert Mitchum passed. Mitchum would have been great of course and publicly stated he regretted not taking the role since he and Marilyn were longtime friends, before both were famous he had worked with her first husband, and he felt that around him she would have been able to pull herself together as she had on River of No Return. This was the end of the line for Gable and his weathered appearance and weariness actually suits the role better than Mitchum&apos;s ruggedness would have at that point. The film contains some of the best acting Clark ever did.\n\nClift and his sad broken looks make a powerful impact and Wallach scores well too but the great Thelma Ritter is somewhat shortchanged since she disappears about halfway through the picture. Her astringent tartness would have been most welcome later in the film when the real heavy going takes place.",

How naked and honest the emotions of this film evoke in me is a priceless feeling that I cherish every so often I get the chance now days. The duality of emotional contrasts is very present in each character vividly. I feel in love with the little boy with a BIG LIFE and how he just wants normalcy, also his tired, worn down mother who is uneducated, unfit (at times), and strong in the same respect. I think that Alma projected each story line in a concise and efficient way that can be felt by a skeleton. The old man is a great well deserved lull or break from the emotional content and serves as a sort of narrator of the spirit of the film and the meaning that I personally got, being resilient through life and also loving life as it happens. Sometimes the camera work was shaky (i personally get motion sickness easily) but overall It was an exceptional work of art, also a very human, organic piece of art. It left me hoping the best for every character, and that is a great ability; to make people feel human, emotions, and love. PS. i gave it a 10 because it is better than the 6.7 rating it has at the current time PSS. shotout to Carson Daily for putting a spotlight on a great work of art, even though universal picked up the film and universal produces his show, I appreciate this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Coming out in 1963, The Girl Who Knew Too Much is not as ground-breaking as other Mario Bava efforts but it&apos;s still every bit as stylish and suspenseful. The plot of the film, convoluted and filled with twists and red herrigns galore, anticipates the giallo cycle of the late 60&apos;s. Of course one year later the director would practically define the style with Blood and Black Lace, introducing other genre staples like the black-gloved killer, the garish colours and the gore but that doesn&apos;t detract from the ifluential status of this proto-giallo.\n\nAs the title imples, The Girl Who Knew Too Much is with one foot firmly set in Hitchcock territory, but whereas Hitch films had a tendency of trying to be too many things at once (little bits of comedy, romance etc) something I always considered distracting, Bava allows nothing to come between him and his goal: a suspenseful horror thriller.\n\nThe chiaroscuro photography is simply beautiful to look at, light and shadow play off each other in expressive ways, not unlike film-noir. Leticia Roman&apos;s face is at times only half-lit to stress her confusion, while in other set-pieces dark figures stand out against fully lit backgrounds. Bava is famous for being one of the best visual directors in the history of the medium for good reason. His black and white work is as good as his colour films.\n\nMinor quibbles I had with the film include that many scares turn out to be false, the first person narration (another film-noir influence) and the implied possibilities in the ending *was it all a dream?* Leticia Roman and John Saxon hit it off with great chemistry, the DP work is fantabulous, the opening 15-20 minutes leading up to the first murder are among the best 20 minutes in 60&apos;s horror and this an all around accomplished horror film that deserves every fan&apos;s attention."

Perhaps the problem is that a biographical film like this of one of the most famous films ever made could have been more dramatic. As it is, it&apos;s definitely rather light-weight and doesn&apos;t have all that much meat to it, but what is there is enjoyable in all the right ways. The cast is solid, but the two leads are really great. Hopkins disappears into the role, and Mirren does wonders with her part in such a charming, charismatic way. As a huge Psycho fan, a film like this is just really enjoyable and entertaining, and in that way it didn&apos;t disappoint. I definitely recommend this."

James Franco is a very talented actor, and I thought he did well in this movie. Not only that, I found Annapolis in general to be an entertaining film. The boxing scenes were well shot and exciting enough. I know that it&apos;s similar to Topgun, but I wouldn&apos;t call it a rip off. It&apos;s got it&apos;s own flare, and I throughly enjoyed watching. A good soundtrack, great cinematography, and good acting really make this movie. This movie might not be for everyone, but I&apos;m usually a pretty tough critic and I really liked it. So, if you&apos;re looking for a good watch one night, go check out Annapolis and decide for yourself.",

He comes to know Julia Stiles&apos; character, a vulnerable housewife living with an unpredictable screw-up (Renner) on barren tundra.\n\nThe relationship between Stiles &amp; Renner was intricate yet believable. And the relationship between Stiles &amp; Whitaker is surprising. I didn&apos;t see the ending coming, which I appreciate always. I&apos;m so tired of formulaic thrillers. This movie reminded me of movies from the 70&apos;s - the good old days when every plot point wasn&apos;t spoon fed. It has style and feeling like classics from that time too.",

Quite a bit is packed into a little more than an hour, and yet the pace always gives you a chance to keep up and to absorb what you learn about each stage of his life.  Fredric March&apos;s narration works quite well, holding your attention while always keeping the focus on the subject matter and not on the narrator.\n\nIt does a very good job of placing the great artist in the context of his era, using cultural and historical background to help you better understand both him and his work.  There is a lot of detail shown from Michelangelo&apos;s various works, and it really impresses upon you his vast array of artistic accomplishments.  Despite being filmed in black-and-white, the visuals are interesting and generally effective.  Overall, it&apos;s nicely done and definitely worth watching if you&apos;re interested in the subject."

      "reviewBody": "The Road To Guantanamo a film which was screened on Channel 4 last night is a harrowing tale of injustice committed by the American Government under the guise of the war on terror.\n\nThree innocent men, (actually four to begin with),childhood friends all British, 3 of Pakistani origin and one Bangladeshi ( not Arab as described by IronicFilmReference review) set off to Pakistan for a holiday and to attend the wedding of one of the 4 men.\n\nWith time on their hands before the wedding, stupidly they decide to go to Afghanistan to help with the relief effort at a time when the US is gearing up for an invasion.\n\nWhen they realise the gravity of the situation in Afghanistan, they try to get back to Pakistan, instead they get taken deeper into the combat zone and there the 4 men from Tipton, became the Tipton 3 as one of their Friends (Monir) gets separated (and is never seen again).\n\nTaken into custody by The US forces after surviving near starvation for a month at the hands of the Northern Alliance what should of been the end of their ordeal turns out to be just the beginning.What emerges next through interviews with the men and re-enactment of events is a tale of unbelievable treatment of the three men and incompetence at the hands of the US authorities.Routine humiliation and torture both physical and psychological in Afghanistan before they are sent to Guantanamo Bay, where they some how endure the same regime for a further 2 years.\n\nThis is an unmissable film/documentary of the above mentioned events which will have you question the freedoms and rights you enjoy so freely and how in this day and age the world is so silent on the injustice and blatant disregard for human rights that is taking place in Guantanamo Bay.Whatever else you do in 2006, watching this film should be at the top of your list.",

John Bolger, who later played Gabe McNamara a police chief on the soap opera Another World, plays a man who is leaving his lover to take a job in Africa. His reasons for leaving are examined and challenged all to the tune of a delightful score by Brahms with Mozart in counterpoint. A visit from a character from Don Giovanni provides a delightful interlude. Fans of The Drew Carey show will enjoy the performance of Kathy Kinney in a role that is almost a mirror image of Mimi.",

Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed &apos;accidentally&apos;. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.\n\nBut what can I say? It&apos;s just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you&apos;ll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo&apos;s by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent.",

      "reviewBody": "Rating as a softcore flick: C+ \n\nWatching Seduction Cinema flicks are a considerably different experience than most other movies of the softcore genre. They usually have poorer production values, attempt at having a plot that constantly shifts in tone, and feature women who, shall I put it kindly, are usually plain and not all that attractive.\n\nBut there are exceptions to that last rule, as I had an immediate crush on Laurie Wallace when I first saw her in The Erotic Witch Project, thus my only reason to seek out the rest of her films under Seduction. This eventually led me to Witchbabe, which had one fairly short scene in it with Julian Wells, but it was enough to make clear that Laurie would have some competition as the hottest chick in Seduction (though, as far as I&apos;m aware, Laurie now works for Torchlight Pictures).\n\nSo Dr. Jekyll and Mistress Hyde marks the first movie I&apos;ve seen with Julian in the lead role, and all things considered, it&apos;s not such a bad softcore movie. Sure, most of the other women are unattractive, particularly Ruby Larocca and the overrated Misty Mundae, but almost every scene features Julian in it, enough to carry me through the short 70 or so minutes.\n\nThe film actually tries to work as a serious psychological drama and as a titillating skin flick, and this is where the problems mostly lie. When it concentrates on the former, it&apos;s mostly a disaster. While the cinematography is surprisingly solid and atmospheric, the acting and script simply aren&apos;t good enough to make any of the drama believable. The performances are especially pathetic, with Larocca sounding like she&apos;s having difficulty memorizing her lines.\n\nBut as a softcore extravaganza, the movie gets just enough right to get a passable recommendation. It is unfortunate, though, that an early masturbation scene with Julian looks as if it boasted a body double in her place, even though such a move makes no sense in this genre. Otherwise, though, I would say the movie is worth watching for those who find Julian Wells an absolute hottie."

      "reviewBody": "Shot in Nazi Germany in 1941, HEIMKEHR shows the suppression of ethnic Germans in a little town in Eastern Poland (now Ukraine) during spring and summer of 1939. While Polish military prepares for war, German schools are closed and plundered. Minority rights are cut down or disrespected. Open hostility and violence against German people increases, while the official authorities watch on. After the outbreak of the war, the Germans are interned into a prison. Only the progress of the Wehrmacht safes them in the last minute. The final scenes show them being re-located and transferred &quot;back to the Reich&quot;.\n\nFor today&apos;s audiences this film shows a world surrealistically turned upside down, as it is a Nazi produced film that accuses ethnic persecution and a chauvinistic state treating his unwelcome citizens with ruthless disposal and disrespect of laws. Many scenes and lines said by the actors appear familiar from countless Anti-Nazi-movies. \n\nThe propagandistic means employed by director Gustav Ucicky are mostly very primitive, as the villainous Poles look ugly and mean with no redeeming qualities at all. Even a few nasty Jewish stereotypes are thrown in.Other scenes, such as the imprisonment of the Germans in a crowded dark cell, have an intense, nightmarish quality, and ironically strongly recall Holocaust iconography for today&apos;s viewers. The final speeches, held by the otherwise great Austrian actress Paula Wessely, are a torture to watch: pathetic, pompous, silly and empty propaganda at its worst, as lifeless as a cardboard.\n\nIt should however be pointed out that the pogrom-like assaults (including murder and manslaughter), the increasing ethnic hostilities and the aggressive nationalist policy of the Polish state, which was also directed against other minorities (or in this particular then-part of Poland rather majorities) such as Ukranians, Jews and Belorussians, is based on well-documented facts, which are given little attention or downplayed by many historians today for mostly political reasons. As the war came closer, the hostilities on both sides increased. There are many scenes, such as an incident at a movie theater when the Germans are forced by an angry crowd to sing the Polish national anthem which may actually be fairly realistic portrayals of the atmosphere in certain parts of the country and the loyalty conflicts endured. \n\nOther now rather forgotten facts of the prelude to the war are shown as well, such as the mobilization of the Polish army as early as March 1939. A Polish propaganda poster which can be seen in one scene, that calls for a Greater Poland reaching as far as Berlin and further is authentic as well. After the outbreak of the war several Thousands of German civilians were interned and massacred throughout Poland. That the Nazis in consequence could do far worse than that is a testament to the cynical hypocrisy and double-speech of totalitarian regimes.",

      "reviewBody": "Take the first 20 minutes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; - with soldiers limbs being shot off at the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach, add some magnificent jungle scenery and action a la &quot;Tears Of The Sun, and put it all in &quot; Blackhawk Down&quot; mode with gunfire dominating the film....and you have the latest Rambo movie.\n\nHey, I knew it was going to be a tough, adventure story but this was a shock. I&apos;ve never seen so many heads blown off, limbs blasted away with blood spurting out and holes blasted in the middle of chests and stomachs in one movie in my life.....and it&apos;s only 81 minutes long! (The last dozen minutes are ending credits.) Man, this is almost non-stop action and suspense/ Yeah, a bunch of it is overdone but overall, it still was an entertaining movie.\n\nI know it sounds like some dumb Texas Chainsaw Massacre-type thing, but it wasn&apos;t despite the mayhem. There actually was a small story with a decent message about making your life stand for something. &quot;Rambo Gets A Conscience&quot; could be another title to this movie.\n\nHowever, if you are the least bit squeamish about bloody violence, you better skip this movie. If you enjoy a good action movie and don&apos;t care if it gets a little gross in spots, this is your cup of tea......in spades. If you have any hostility in you, after 80 minutes of watching this, it should be gone. \n\nAfter an absence of 20 years, Sylvester Stallone&apos;s &quot;John Rambo&quot; comes back to the screen. Rambo is the kind of guy you don&apos;t want on your college debate team but he&apos;s a number one draft choice on the field of battle. He&apos;s a man of few words and a lot of testosterone. With veins popping out of his arms like a 25-year-old bodybuilder, Stallone looks more juiced than Barry Bonds but at least it makes him look the part, even if he does have bags under his eyes. I liked Stallone&apos;s comeback in the recent &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; better, but this was still an entertaining flick.\n\nThe middle-aged John Rambo was more realistic than the male missionary, &quot;Michael Burnett,&quot; who was a bit obnoxious for who he was playing. I&apos;ve met a number of missionaries and none of them act or sound like this guy, but that&apos;s the film world for you. The guy with the Australian accent who was the &quot;leaders&quot; of the mercenary group was a bit over-the-top and cartoon-like with the profanity. With him, and the Burmese rebel leader, you had no probably identifying who the a-holes were in this movie, and who were the good guys. They weren&apos;t too subtle about that. Then again, the action scenes weren&apos;t too subtle, either - but it was entertaining, in a sick sort of way.\n\nOne last thing that everyone should agree with: this was nicely filmed, with fantastic jungle scenery. Kudos for cinematographer Glen MacPherson and director Stallone for some incredible shots. I cannot imagine how good this must look on a high-definition disc.",

Not because it was really a very bad film, but because something so much better could have been done here.\n\nI arrived at it because i&apos;ve been interested in Spanish cinema, and this one could strike me as something worth watching though not the best Sapin has to offer.\n\nIn comes in a line of Amenábar. Somehow closed thrillers, appealing to an inner search, resolving conflicts in abstract, living parallel worlds, parallel to a reality which is as &quot;normal&quot; as possible. It worked in &quot;Abre los ojos&quot; because of the dreamworld vs hell duality. Here the mixture is between various &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;not normal&quot; worlds: \n\n\n* the always fascinating period of religious ceremonies in Spanish Andalucía.\n\n\n\n* the &quot;game&quot; world, invented by Mollà&apos;s character, through which Simón (Noriega) will get at his inner struggle.\n\n\n\n* Noriega, again playing his &quot;abre los ojos&quot; character, safe choice by the production, no risk \n\n\nThis is a failure, due to several aspects: one related to direction, which has to do with not being able to &quot;hold&quot; interest until the end, the film dies completely as the historical Seville center is exchanged by the Expo92 site. this leads me to second aspect, picking up Sevilla, in the moment of its more visceral, more mediterranean moment of the year, and building there an absolutely inner abstract Amenábar kind of story is a failure by principle. No story can hold against those strong traditions. You either make a picture &quot;about&quot; Sevilla, about religion, and insert content on that basis (it was following that path for the first half) or you detach the story from any perfectly identifiable context (example once more: Abre los ojos) and build whatever you want in that abstract/normal/universal etc. space. And in this second,you have to hold the viewer with strong thinking and fine construction. The first chance s more documented in a way, more &quot;earth-to-earth&quot;, the second may (or not) work out more intelligent.\n\nAnyway, trying to mix both was the failure here. OK, Amenábar&apos;s soundtrack, following Herrmann is good, works in the mood, there are good shots of Sevilla, exploring some places, and the overall production is quite good (Spanish is now and was already here in a great production level). But you have much better things to watch from this country. Anyway i&apos;m still trying to find something worthwhile and which understands Sevilla, a fantastic city to which cinema hasn&apos;t been paying the necessary tribute.\n\nMy evaluation: 3/5 (holds only for the production, some beautiful faces, and the other good elements i mentioned)"

      "name": "When Jack&apos;s on screen, you can almost never go wrong!",
      "reviewBody": "Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I&apos;m not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen.  The moment I see Jack&apos;s face on screen, I get this feeling that everything&apos;s going to be all right.  He could do a Pauly Shore film, and elevate its quality with his mere presence.  And I didn&apos;t even get to his acting.\n\nNicholson won a well-deserved Oscar for this movie.  Then again, I feel like he deserves an Oscar for virtually everything he&apos;s been in.  Hell, you can even give him an Oscar nod for &quot;Anger Management.&quot;  THAT&apos;S how great he is! He&apos;s one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he&apos;s not saying anything than when he is.  And of course, he has one of the coolest movie star voices ever, so it makes it a joy whenever he does speak.  I still feel like &quot;You can&apos;t handle the truth!&quot; wouldn&apos;t be as priceless a line if Jack didn&apos;t yell it.  He can say almost any line of dialogue and turn it into gold.  In this movie it was &quot;You make me wanna be a better man.&quot;  Again, an otherwise forgettable line of dialogue made gold by Jack.\n\n &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; is a flawed film, with scenes that drag and an overlong running time, but it&apos;s highly enjoyable and altogether pretty well-written. Aside from its many hilarious moments, it&apos;s also quite touching.  But I have to admit that it&apos;s the comedy that sticks out most in my memory.  There&apos;s some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack&apos;s usual table.  He first intrudes into their conversation saying, &quot;People who speak in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch.&quot;  He complains to Helen Hunt, his usual waitress, saying &quot;I have Jews at my table!&quot;  He then intrudes in the couple&apos;s conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying &quot;Obviously your appetites aren&apos;t as big as your noses.&quot;  Now, I probably wouldn&apos;t want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I still found those cracks to be hysterically funny.  The same when he attacks Greg Kinnear&apos;s gay character with constant homosexual slurs.\n\n The performances are great all-around.  Though Jack pretty much steals the show, Greg Kinnear gives a wonderfully endearing performance.  He doesn&apos;t play out the gay stereotypes, yet he&apos;s sensitive and feminine enough to have me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on &quot;Will and Grace&quot; who acts like he&apos;s gay for the sake of the show&apos;s gimmick).  It&apos;s nice to see Kinnear rise from the host of &quot;Talk Soup&quot; and the thankless late night talk show &quot;Later&quot; to a fine actor.  Previously, I wouldn&apos;t have any notion that he could become what he is now.  Helen Hunt also gives a compelling, emotionally packed performance.  And Shirley Knight, as her mother, provides a little bit of comic relief.  Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small but interesting role, and he makes the best of it.\n\nThe film does have its dull moments, but Jack&apos;s one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile.  There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could&apos;ve played Melvin better than him.  I read in the trivia that John Travolta was originally offered the role.  Now, I like Travolta, but in this type of role he wouldn&apos;t hold a candle to Jack.\n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the crap the filmmakers had to endure to get this one done, it took its share of pans when it came out: A pious piece of agitprop full of too-good-to-be-true and too-bad-to-be-believed stick figures, etc etc. Today, it holds up well - first, its use of &quot;real&quot; locations and &quot;real&quot; people appears more valuable in a documentary sense the farther away we get from the time it was made. Second, the production values, especially the cinematography - the Blacklist claimed some of the more talented technicians in Hollywood, and Salt of the Earth benefits richly from their work.\n\n Third, the themes remain quite relevant. When we see footage of, say Bolivian coca growers taking to the streets to overthrow their country&apos;s US-sponsored tycoon president, what&apos;s so surprising about a community of Mexican American workers standing in solidarity against an exploitative mining company? When we see Justice for Janitors bringing the owners of LA&apos;s office towers to the table (at least), what&apos;s so far-fetched about workers in Salt of the Earth grabbing a bit of justice for themselves? I could go on.\n\nFrom the vantage point of 2003, Salt of the Earth looks like a refreshing change. Agitprop is news to a lot of people today - it can be powerful if done well, yet we&apos;re now all conditioned to think that any form of dramatic art that doesn&apos;t center obsessively on the isolated individual is false and/or sentimental. Is Salt of the Earth really more sentimental than On the Waterfront (made about the same time), in which a corruption struggle on the New Jersey docks serves merely as the scenery for Marlon Brando&apos;s emoting about his boxing career?? Come on!!\n\nPeople who stand in solidarity really are powerful. Americans are taught not to think so, but it&apos;s when they stand up together, not separately, that they win the biggest victories (and I don&apos;t mean in uniform, either)."

The story chronicles the current lives of the members of an avant garde musical group in Germany in the mid 1960&apos;s. A group of American G.I.&apos;s who met each other while playing around on instruments in the equivalent of the Army mess hall, and got good enough as a band to play local gigs as a band called the Torquays around Germany. A team of German producers discovered them and turned them into The Monks, and branded them with corporate identity insisnting wherever they go they are monks dressed and acting like monks. The music was ten to twenty years ahead of it&apos;s time. A combination of techno, punk, metal and rock and roll, they have a sound unlike anyone else at the time. After a few years of touring Germany they came home to the U.S penniless, and found out thirty years later they were a cult band. Very worth while, well done documentary, highly recommended to all.",

It&apos;s the brief (but not quite brief enough) saga of a cold-blooded killer who&apos;s put to death, then somehow returns to life as a stabbin&apos;, laughin&apos;, wise-crackin&apos;, foot-tall slab of holiday confectionery. As if that premise needed a little extra kick, this monstrous devil-cookie also happens to be voiced by Gary Busey. The concept itself is hilarious for all of ten minutes, but burns out quickly as the plot tries, courageously but hopelessly, to make us care about his victims. It&apos;s atrociously acted of course, the equivalent of D-grade porn stars who keep their clothes on, so those misguided storytelling efforts don&apos;t even have a fighting chance. A moment rarely passes without some manner of absurd stupidity. If it isn&apos;t a particularly bad pun, a wickedly awful special effect or a pathetic dash of vacant dialog, surely there&apos;s a glaringly obvious editing mistake in view. We&apos;re talking night-becomes-day-becomes-night, several times in the same scene. Removing a baking pan from the oven with bare hands, commenting on how its contents are freshly scorched, then casually setting it aside. Firing seventeen times from a six-shooter. Though it runs for just an hour and ten minutes, that seems about twice as long as it should&apos;ve. I had almost as much fun glancing at the cover art as I did watching the entire thing.",

      "reviewBody": "Probably one of the worst movies of the 1980&apos;s, &apos;And God Created Woman&apos; stars Rebecca De Mornay as Robin, a prison inmate who convinces the prison handyman (Spano) to marry her for a large sum of money so she can get released on parole. When she&apos;s out, they move in together and don&apos;t get along. Robin starts a rock-band, hoping to fulfill her life long dreams of becoming famous. Soon Robin catches the eye of local senator James Tiernan, and they eventually have an affair. As Robin&apos;s new found freedom is put in jeopardy, she must do whatever she can to remain free, while not hurting the man she really loves.\n\nIf there was ever a movie looking for a point, this is it. The movie has no direction, it wants to be too many things and ends up nowhere. There are prison breaks, gratuitous sex, family squabbles, political banquets, and rock bands. The writing in this is so over the top I had a hard time figuring out if this movie was intended as a drama or a comedy.\n\nHack director Roger Vadim, remaking his own 1956 film of the same name, had hoped this might do for De Morney what the original film did for famous sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, but the film turned out to be a box-office dud, and she&apos;d have to wait a few more years before her chilling performance in &apos;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&apos; finally saw her deservedly hit the big time.",

S. video market. It plays like an elongated tv episode.\n\nBen Gazzara is a bit uncomfortable in the lead role of a semi-successful magician touring Europe with his whiny (&quot;Let&apos;s get married&quot;) assistant Mary Crosby. Nasties, led by Ivan Desny, plot to use him as the dupe to kill an African leader attending a summit conference in Locarno, with the blame to fall on Gazzara.\n\nThe hitmen fail to complete their mission, with Gazzara escaping rather than being murdered. With the aid of Crosby and other beautiful women he adapts his long-in-the-works super magic trick to outwit and catch the baddies.\n\nPic is well lensed on lovely locations but fails to generate suspense. Gazzara&apos;s magic feats are perfunctory, and little interest is generated by the cornball romantic rivalry between Crosby and their employer (Catherine Jarrett) for Gazzara&apos;s boudoir attentions.\n\nTech credits are good, including English dubbing of support roles supervised by Robert Rietty."

The acting was terrible and all of the characters seemed to be complete idiots. The whole story was poorly written and the special effects weren&apos;t that good. What bothered me most though was the fact that the leading actress looked nothing like the girl on the cover. It&apos;s obvious which girl is meant to be the main character in the story just by looking at the cover image but at the beginning of the film I was constantly asking &quot;Well, where is she?&quot; because I couldn&apos;t find her. Unlike the girl on the cover the girl actually playing the leading role, despite the movie&apos;s claims of her beauty, is actually quite homely. The actress playing Crystal would have been better suited to play the role of Siren. Combine that with her bland emotionless acting and I can&apos;t see this leading actress going very far in the movie business."

I liked very much, the director has been able to represent the human side of the North Koreans, and the actors were really proved in part, of all people especially the captain Agari ruthless and brutal to the end. The film quality is defended quite well, of course, for the era in which it was made, you notice the due limits, such as the struggles with bare hands through his partisans are made as best or you will never see the fire from weapons, but they only hear the sound .... but you can easily turn a blind eye and enjoy this milestone in Korean cinema And a movie for many but not for everyone, is because it is not the usual war movie, the context must be of interest to the viewer. Personally I consider it an art-house films, so it can be heavy viewers unfamiliar. In my case it was not so, the nearly two hours of the film have been well spent and satisfying, among others are also able to recover and see the excellent documentary about Piagol and duration of forty-five minutes, and that I consider very instructive. I&apos;d like to see other movies about this genre, the theme interests me very much and I would look into.",

      "name": "Brooding and meditative piece exploring trouble in proposed upper-class paradise as love; disenchantment and ill-felt notions spawn chaos and frayed morals.",
      "reviewBody": "The two characters primarily involved in Claude Chabrol&apos;s 1969 French thriller The Unfaithful Wife have, at least at the beginning, rather an idyllic and somewhat pleasant set up in their lives. When we first encounter them, we see both the husband and titular wife with their rather extended family in a large garden on a warm, sunny and welcoming day; the tone of the exchanges polite, the activity nothing out of the ordinary nor needlessly extravagant. The opening shots of such imagery are quite crudely broken up by a blurred effect which drowns the screen of its focus, the ideal family unit itself thus becoming difficult to firmly latch one&apos;s eyes onto; the credits begin, some rather harsh and somewhat official looking credits that scroll upwards in a military manner whilst some distorting piano music plays overhead. It&apos;s a fleeting few minutes or so of idealism in-between such a sequence, the film going on to form a superior mediation on human behaviour masquerading as a causality thriller as paradise is rendered corrupt and peeking beneath the surface of the upper-classes reveals deception and titular unfaithfulness.\n\nThe film is unrelentingly fascinating, a piece never for more than a few seconds ever in the slightest bit uninteresting; a grim and somewhat bleak study how love, anger and victimisation brew together to create a cocktail of violence and anguish and how that in itself can come to forge a relationship which was never initially set in stone. The film&apos;s methodical lead is Michel Bouquet&apos;s Charles Desvallees, a lawyer with his own office located in a small enough building amidst the bustling Parisian streets away from the large, more ruralised country house in which he lives with his family. The family, of which, is made up of the titular wife, a certain Hélène (Audran) who&apos;s about the same age as her husband and is the mother to young son Michel (Di Napoli). The warm and welcoming day in the garden spent with Charles&apos; mother and Hélène&apos;s in-law turns into evening, Charles&apos; verbal illustrating of various plans he would like to have happen the following day involving both he and Hélène out and about doing things are shot down with casual reasons which excuse Hélène from attending. As they sit and observe a television broadcast later on during the evening, the signal begins to break up and the machine ceases to function as well as it might, thus further insinuating a breaking down of communication of an operative item and echoing their marriage.\n\nAt work, and aside from Charles&apos; rich circle of friends and busy schedule, he observes through young female secretary Brigitte (Turri) the very essence of temptation. His suspicion brought about by his wife&apos;s behaviour, and Chabrol&apos;s own channelling onto the audience of signs and notions towards an upsetting of a paradise-like set up or the malfunctioning of a working order, beginning to resonate. Desperate, as thoughts; feelings and drama all at once clinically escalate, Charles darts to the nearest payphone to call a place of business Hélène said she&apos;d be; the piano music from earlier only suggesting at something seriously wrong with what idealism we were seeing beginning to pipe up again to form the overlying soundtrack to the news she is not where she said she&apos;d be.\n\nThe painful inevitable is confirmed when a private detective Charles hires reveals to him the truth; that Hélène is, in fact, having an affair and with a writer named Victor Pégala (Ronet) based not so far away. The film allows Charles a moment you sparsely see in today&apos;s age of thrillers; a moment of contemplation that has him stand beside a river flowing through the urbanised locale in which the reveal was announced so as to merely look across to the other side of it, digesting what it is has been exposed to him. It is around about here in the film that Chabrol applies a gear change so dramatic and so effective that it propels the piece beyond its combined brooding roots of paranoia and suspicion and into an echelon of unpredictability; horror and human emotion in its some of its rawest forms. In short, the switch in tone and content works remarkably; the film coming to have Charles journey to the man and see him.\n\nThe film&apos;s causality infused thrills and scares following the venturing into the territory it goes near does nothing to distract the film from its overall tract; it is a film that is able to evoke just as much an on-edge reaction from its audience following a character&apos;s glance or nervous facial reaction as it can from a minor car accident. Chabrol&apos;s capturing of some of the interplay towards the conclusion as two people are forced into hiding varying secrets from both one another and the police is fascinating, and the film does not loose sight of son Michel&apos;s role as the picturesque representative of innocence caught up amidst all this and made to suffer out of others&apos; ill-gotten decisions. Chabrol&apos;s overall ending is decidedly bleak, but his conclusion that the two we examine whom previously appeared to fall away from each other only to reconnect when some sort of duality was established, is dangerously uplifting given the sorts of events which aided in this and the actions the lovebirds undertook; all of it combining to form a superior thriller of an immensely sophisticated ilk.",

      "reviewBody": "Five former college friends travel for the wedding of the wealthy Lila Hayes (Anna Paquin) with Tom McDevon (Josh Duhamel) at her family&apos;s beach house. The maid of honor Laura Rosen (Katie Holmes) was the roommate of Lila in the college and the groom Tom was her boyfriend. Laura still misses Tom and the groom is not sure that he shall marry Lila. Along the eve of the wedding day, they have a dinner rehearsal and drink a lot of booze, and Tom and Laura get close to each other and rekindle their love.\n\n&quot;The Romantics&quot; is a film about reunion and this there have produced solid movies and my favorites are &quot;Peter&apos;s Friends&quot; and &quot;St. Elmo&apos;s Fire&quot;. Unfortunately &quot;The Romantics&quot; is dull, boring, characters with no chemistry and poorly developed in an awful screenplay and story. Summarizing, it is a dreadful film. Laura is a despicable characters and I do not understand why she goes to the wedding to be the maid of honor and spends the night with the groom and vomits her feelings to Lila ten minutes before the wedding. Tom is a weak and uncharismatic character. Candice Bergen seems to be constipated with her grimaces and the sexy Swedish Malin Akerman and her thighs are the best that his film can offer. My vote is two.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Casamento do Meu Ex&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of My Ex&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "What I&apos;ve always enjoyed about this film is that, once you get past all the slapstick and Jewish American Princess jokes, you find the story of a sheltered young woman seeking her identity and independence. Judy Benjamin has been raised in a very coddled existence, believing she can do nothing, and that her only value is to be someone&apos;s wife, or attached to a person in some way. When her husband dies on her wedding night, she foolishly joins the army, where her inability is played for laughs. But this is not what the film is really about, in the long run. When her parents come to retrieve her, Barbara Barrie as Judy&apos;s mom is literally holding the pen, showing Judy where to sign. To me, this scene is very believable. It&apos;s as if Judy finally realizes that she has set herself up to fail. She decides to stay and proves that she can do a good job, she just believed she couldn&apos;t.\n\nPerhaps my perspective is different because I saw this film first in 1980 when I was 18 years old, but I still enjoy it to this day. I can overlook the portions that are not very PC by today&apos;s standards. It was, after all, a different world then. I find Goldie Hawn&apos;s performance to have great comic timing and believability. Eileen Brennan is memorable in her role, even though it is a bit stereotypical by today&apos;s standards. Barbara Barrie and Sam Wanamaker are hilarious as Judy&apos;s parents, and Robert Webber is unforgettable as Col. Clay Thornbush. I will always enjoy this film, perhaps always from a different viewpoint.",

He is doing what MLK and Bob Dylan did in the 1960s, what Democrates did in the Agora in Ancient Greece... Michael Moore is the voice of the underdog for a new generation - who genuinely cares that the excluded, the poor, the workers, and the unemployed are Americans too.\n\nEven if you hate MM, and really disagree with everything he&apos;s ever made, you should still agree that his films are a voice that is allowed to be heard.\n\nThe documentary itself is without a doubt good propaganda for the Democratic vote, but it also pretty good entertainment - it is very funny, and very, very poignant in places...\n\n....And the students love him.\n\nPretty stirring in places, with some good live music thrown in, MM is an excellent orator - let&apos;s just hope he never becomes a politician - even though he&apos;s got the chops for it - because he is the living proof that to hope is to be an American. And that one person can by getting off his or her slacker behind remind us what is means to care for We, the People rather than just Me...\n\nDefinitely worth the free download...",

The depth of the tragedy inflicted on the Navajo to this very day by the US Government through the BIA is hard to comprehend. The Euro-American race has long proved its prowess in human rights violations, but there is a particular cruelty in its methods against the Navajo and Hopi nations, who they tried to set against each other in order to pillage the incredible wealth under the land and poison it in the process. It could certainly be construed as torture, with shots of BIA bulldozers destroying even the desert vegetation to deprive the people of their food and medicine. When they could have given them much more than the peanuts (2 to 3% of the value of all that coal, gas, oil, and uranium!!!) and given them a few mesas on which to live their old dignified ways. Which is all they ever really wanted. Exploited for their beautiful weaving and jewelry too, ripped off, people! \n\nThe documentary is nearly perfect in execution, with wonderful narration by Martin Sheen and character voices by Buffy St Marie and Burgess Meredith(!). And a special treat for Laura Nyro fans, she wrote and sings an original song, a beautiful piece that weaves in and out of the film. Please watch it.",

I waited for a scene where someone ,or something is watching them,ready for one of them to leave the group,go off to pee,or make the beast with 2 backs,and get killed.Well,instead,they broke into ....more lame songs.It was at this point,i realized i was watching a musical.Now,i do watch them sometimes,and i did make it thru &quot;Little shop of horror&quot;(both versions),but this movie was not what i expected.Long scenes of singing,at the strangest times,a story that makes no sense,very little blood,sub-par effects,and basic camera work made this a LONG watch.i did make it till the end,but felt like a ass,for sticking around.All in all,i have seen much better musicals,and WAY better horror films.To me,this movie fails on BOTH levels.",

      "reviewBody": "... and I always round up when I&apos;m at the halfway mark, just to explain. This is a fine watch in spite of the choppy script.\n\nCooper and Widmark&apos;s characters&apos; boat breaks down on the way to the California gold fields--they have to stop in Mexico. They head to a local cantina. Susan Hayward comes in and says she is offering one thousand dollars in gold to anyone who will help her save her husband, who was trapped in a cave-in. She says the mine is right in the middle of cursed country called &quot;Garden of Evil&quot; - The film proceeds from there.\n\nThe uneven screenplay is credited to Frank Fenton. Bernard Herrmann contributed a score that supplies more drama than the screenplay; the handsome cinematography is credited to Milton Krasner and Jorge Stahl. Jr.\n\nWidmark is especially good as the man who&apos;s not used to being a good guy. Cooper and Hayward are as effective as the script allows. The rest of the cast is adequate. Look for a young Rita Moreno in the cantina.\n\nCritics yawned when the film was released, but it made a healthy profit, especially considering it cost around two million dollars to film. This is probably the most beautiful film Cooper made in the 1950&apos;s, and the most underrated.",

Jackson&apos;s role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.\n\nThis is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued role for him, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he&apos;s barely audible.\n\nBut he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn&apos;t happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it&apos;s preposterous. I&apos;ll just call an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis&apos; wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).\n\n&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie. This movie is done by the same man who did &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; M. Night Shyamalan, so if you enjoyed that you probably would like this, too.....although it&apos;s so different I wouldn&apos;t want to predict who would like this film and who wouldn&apos;t. If you&apos;re open to try something different, give it a look.",

It was wonderful to watch the kids giggle and hurrah at Vin Diesel, tough guy, nice guy, real softie routine. Whether he was kicking bad guys or changing diapers, he was great. While there were many clichés and material we&apos;ve all seen in other forms, we sometime forget that this stuff works. My child is 8 and this is fresh to him. I&apos;m so please that we were able to bring 18 people of varying ages who all had a good time.

On the way they have to cope with the modern world quite strange to them, as well as with their own back stories and desires (thus the tagline &apos;and lead us into temptation&apos;). They get mixed up in church politics and make the acquaintance of a charming and crafty young journalist, a romantic yet disturbing meeting both for her an for the youngest monk. Somehow they manage to sing many a beautiful medieval or renaissance hymn on the way, and in the end it is the mysticism of their music that carries them through. The cast does an excellent job in portraying the quaint protagonists, the locations have been chosen lovingly and fit right into the story, and the whole cinematography is very solid work. If you have the chance to see this rather obscure gem, go ahead and have a treat.",

      "reviewBody": "After his wife and son are killed by a stray meteor (or was it a mis-guided alien probe?) an unemployed astronomer begins to research UFO sightings, starting to imagine that aliens are among us and that he is being watched. He goes on a five year quest to understand why his family had to die and finally finds a book that may hold clues to the answer, but now the author is dead. So he befriends the author&apos;s son in an effort to learn more. The answer is surprising.\n\nThe movie was described as an &quot;Adventure Documentary.&quot; No kidding, they really called it that, but it was shown late at night at the same hour I used to watch &quot;Creature Features&quot; and &quot;Fright Night,&quot; so I think you get the idea. But anyone expecting to be scared by this film, even a little bit, will be disappointed.\n\nWhat you will get are a bunch of conspiracy theories about how the aliens are among us, and that ghost sightings or sightings of Big Foot are examples of those aliens, and that the Men in Black are spying on us.\n\nIf this movie wasn&apos;t so weird it would not have been worth watching at all. Also, seeing a man slowing claw his way out of the grips of insanity has it&apos;s merits I suppose."

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. It is rare that we find a movie so unsettling to watch, yet admire the expertise with which it is made. Such is the case with award-winning documentarian James Marsh and his presentation of Project Nim. This is the story of Nim Chimpsky, the chimp from the 1970&apos;s who was taught sign-language and raised by humans.\n\nThe chimp&apos;s name is taken from Noam Chomsky, the famous MIT linguist. Unfortunately, the linguistic side of this story actually is quite minor compared to what really occurred. Columbia professor Herbert Terrace wanted to conduct an experiment on a baby chimp to see if it could be raised like a human baby and learn to communicate with people. He started the project by snatching the baby from its mother at two weeks of age, and then plopping it right into a large, free-spirited family with no scientific or primate-training background. Heck, no one in the family even knows sign language! The film shows how quickly Nim adapts to the pampered lifestyle and is even breast-fed by Stephanie, the mother. Nim is also exposed to smoking pot, drinking alcohol and even has limited success being potty trained. All of this is explained away with &quot;it was the seventies&quot;. I was already bouncing between sadness and anger.\n\nAdmittedly, I am no scientist. I do know that a true science experiment or project would involve specific records and at least some type of plan ... not to mention the recording of actions, tests and progress. Instead, Professor Terrace shows up periodically for some photo ops and a hug from Nim. Poof! He is gone again. While this is never really explained in the film, one can only assume he was benefiting nicely from a huge grant, not to mention &quot;close&quot; relationships with a couple of his assistants. The other thing left unexplained was how Nim&apos;s mother had other babies taken from her in a similar manner. We get no detail on those &quot;experiments&quot;.\n\nAs Nim gets older, guess what ... he gets bigger and stronger. He is difficult to control and even lashes out periodically at his caregivers, once quite violently. He is bounced from home to home and person to person. He does adapt, but he is just too strong and unpredictable to be part of human society. Finally, he is sold off to an animal rescue farm. That&apos;s just great, except initially there are no other chimps. Not a good thing for a social primate.\n\nThe whole thing is just painful to watch. I couldn&apos;t help but feel sympathy for the chimp and anger at the people ... especially Professor Terrace. His selfish, ill-conceived project negatively impacted the life of a chimp and the safety and well-being of many good-hearted people along the way.\n\nWhile there was proof that Nim learned approximately 125 signs, the question remains ... did he really understand these words and phrases? Did he instead learn behavior that led to his reward? One of Nim&apos;s later day caregivers (Bob Ingersoll) visited him often at the rescue farm until at the age of 26, Nim passed away. The average lifespan of a chimp in the wild is about 45 years. So, it would appear neither the chimp or the people really benefited from Project Nim. It is, however, a well made documentary.",

      "name": "Spaghetti/Paella Western co-produced by Italy/Spain about a Mexican avenger seeking justice and vendetta",
      "reviewBody": "This Chorizo/Spaghetti Western is filled with noisy action , thrills , intrigue and spectacular shootouts . It is starred by the ¨Desesperado¨ with Glenn Saxson as the dashing masked avenger . It starts with a group of cutthroats attack a farm of a Mexican family , killing all of them ; except the youngest son . Many years later , the little boy called Manuel Lopez becomes ¨El Desesperado¨ , a masked man who defends good people and specially the Mexican families harassed by American settlers . He poses as a foppish who travels with model girls but the takes a secret identity , disguising as the &quot;The Desesperado&quot; to combat enemies and to help Mexican peasants oppose a notorious land baron who has cruelly oppressed them . He faces a tough, gun-wielding saloon owner , Blackie Stark (Massimo Serato as John Barracuda) and corrupt Judge Wilkins (Beni Deus) . Then Manuel falls in love for the Judge&apos;s daughter (Barbara Loy) . When Manuel Lopez&apos;s friends become targets in this struggle , the full revenge of ¨El Desesperado¨ will be unveiled.\n\nAgreeable movie , plenty of action , thrills , gun-play , a love story ; all meld together under Luigi Capuano&apos;s ordinary direction . It drags at times , balancing in ups and downs ; turning out to be entertaining enough . Although the story has been told before , similar to ¨Zorro¨ films , passable filmmaking and nice acting win out , but it results in an acceptable Western flick . The movie has the typical Spaghetti characters , as the violent facing , greedy antiheroes, bloody and spectacular showdowns, quick zooms , extreme baddies and being compellingly directed . The picture is a tale of justice and revenge , as a gunfighter looks for a man in a little town and seeks vendetta against the parents&apos;s killers . It is a combination of overwhelming crossfire and full of villainy , romance and heroism . Interesting screenplay by Manuel Martinez Remis who wrote various Macaroni/Chorizo Westerns such as &quot;Quinto: Fighting Proud¨ , &quot;God Was in the West, Too, at One Time&quot; and ¨Reverendo Colt¨. Fun acting by Glenn Saxson as an adventurer who uses all kind of shrewdness in order to destroy his enemies . The starring is stunningly played by the Dutch Glenn Saxson . Glenn is very fine , he ravages the screen , he jumps , bounds and leaps , hit and run . Glenn as a brave and two-fisted gunslinger is terrific , subsequently the would play similar roles in other Spaghettis ; as he also starred &quot;Django Spara Per Primo¨ and ¨Vete con Dios , Gringo¨ . Music original by Francesco De Massi composes a nice Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted and splendid leitmotif ; it&apos;s full of enjoyable sounds and emotive score . Support cast is frankly well , full of familiar faces from Tortilla/Spaghetti as Spanish players : Beni Deus , Gloria Osuna , Luis Induni , as Italian ones : Giorgo Cieroni , Nerio Bernardi , Glauco Onorato and Riccardo Pizzuti ; the latter , Hill-Spencer films&apos;s ordinary . There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction , adequate production design , and atmospheric cinematography by Pablo Ripoll , he creates an appropriate scenario on the interior ranch and barren outdoors , dirty as well as rocky landscapes , and being shot in Elios studios (Rome) , El Lazio and Spain : Manzanares Del Real , Colmenar Viejo and La Pedriza , Madrid . However , a perfect remastering being necessary because of the copy is washed-out .\n\nThe motion picture was professionally directed by Luigi Capuano . He was a good craftsman who made all kind of genres , and especially adventure movie . Capuano directed Spaghetti Western such as &quot;Il Magnifico Texano&quot; , Peplum as ¨Revenge of Ursus¨ ,&quot;Revenge of the Gladiators&quot; , &quot;Hercules and the Black Pirates&quot; and of course Adventures such as &quot;Zorro in the Court of Spain&quot; , &quot;Zorro, Rider of Vengeance&quot; , ¨Zorro and three musketeers¨ ,&quot;Tiger of the Seven Seas&quot; , ¨leopard of Sarawak¨ , ¨Vengeance of Sandokan¨ , &quot;Terror of the Red Mask&quot; starred by Lex Barker and &quot;The Lion of St. Mark&quot; set in Venice and starred by Gordon Scott .",

      "reviewBody": "Fear is real. Even big wave surfers are scared of something. &quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot; legitimizes the raw strength of the ocean&apos;s largest source of energy. A close relationship to both the surf in Northern California&apos;s Pacific and to the man who trains him how to survive its largest beast, this big wave film highlights some of the most interesting parts of big wave surfing psychology. Fear, love, loss... and finding a balance amidst it all. Drop into theaters to see Maverick&apos;s on the big screen - that should be reason enough. Period.\n\n-Shannon Marie Quirk, Editor of TheSurfChannel.com\n\nThe Surf Channel Television Network www.thesurfchannel.com",

Then, onto diving in the seven deadliest prehistoric seas, with creatures ranging from the 3 meter fish-eating reptile Nothosaurus, to the 15 meter, whale-eating shark Megalodon. Whoever says that man is the greatest species on the planet, has a lot to learn, perhaps this will clue you in. Fun, freaky and highly educational, this is something anyone can enjoy.",

After talking with a psychiatrist (Elwes) that still works in the hospital Roslyn (Foster) begins to see things differently. This movie is hard to explain and review. One because it jumps around between daydreams, flashbacks and the normal movie scenes that its hard to keep track where you are, and two because it&apos;s kinda boring I wasn&apos;t focused on it the entire time. This movie was a little like the &quot;Last Exorcism&quot; in the way that it seemed like every few minutes the plot and idea switched back and forth. There were so many ideas that could have gone somewhere cool if they let it. Even though this is another &quot;Ghosthouse&quot; movie it was more psychological then scary. I really don&apos;t feel one way or the other about it, not much of an impact. I give it a C.\n\nWould I watch again? - No, barely made it through once.",

The very same year ,two other political prisoners ,unfairly executed ,Sacco and Vanzetti ,were the subject of Guido Montaldo&apos;s movie and then again ,Baez sang the song ,&quot;here&apos;s to you&quot; on a music by Ennio Morricone ,which was a big hit almost everywhere (except in both the US and the UK)\n\n&quot;Joe Hill&quot; owes a big deal to its principal Thommy Berggrens ,whose performing is absolutely mind-boggling,mainly in the scene of the trial ,where he demands to defend himself ,because he knows his so called lawyers are bribed and that it&apos;s a travesty of a trial .the subject of the film,too red, too &quot;commie&quot; prevented him from becoming a big star .\n\nIt seems that his political awareness stems from the way religion deals with poverty : the Salvation Army&apos;s canticles provide a sharp contrast with Joe&apos;s revolutionary and foot-tapping song : he does not ask for pie in the sky but a square deal for the underprivileged , exploited by the wealthy bosses who treat them like dogs ,bully and humiliate them ( the scene when they force them to kiss the American flag is revealing). Joe was a generous hero ,-the actor&apos;s boyish look makes wonders- his final testament is deeply moving ,his spirit lives on, &quot;where working men defend their rights, it&apos;s there you&apos;ll find Joe Hill.&quot;",

I saw this movie when I was 10 years old and was impressed by it&apos;s pacing, the plot twist, and the fact that in the end it is just as it is billed, a romantic war movie. For a guy like me who cant stand romantic war movies I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this obscure film not once but the many times I have watched it. If during the course of a film you feel that same longing a character experiences then it has made it&apos;s mark. When David Halloran,  Harrison&apos;s character, transitions from cocky bomber pilot to reluctant pilot who begins to hear the concerns of his bombardier as well as his heart, from the unhealthy romance of two people in need of something concrete in a time of uncertainty, from the struggle to get back to the one you love this movie runs the gammit of what war is like for lovers, soldiers, and ordinary civilians caught up in it. Think of loving someone so much they make you ache then throw in the fact that they are someone elses lover and the knowledge that you will have to turn and walk away from them forever."

      "reviewBody": "Released just after historic 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the film recreates the work of early rocket developers (including American Goddard) with a focus on Soviet space pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. The biographical material is well made and interesting (as are the brief lessons in physics, ballistics and aeronautics) but the second half of the film, which speculates on the future of space exploration, is outstanding. The first manned flight (including &apos;space-walks&apos;) is predicted to carry three cosmonauts into orbit and the zero-G effects are incredibly realistic (apparently Kubrick used similar clever wirework in &apos;2001 A Space Odyssey&apos; (1968)). The film is extremely optimistic about the future of space travel and there is an excellent scene of gantry after gantry raising a row of streamlined rockets into takeoff positions. The segment about life on the rotating space station is also very well done (although being allowed to take your cat with you seems a stretch) with thought given to the kinds of research opportunities such a station would provide. The film closes with an excellent depiction of a manned lunar landing, the establishment of a lunar base, and the beginning of interplanetary exploration. While the images of the future don&apos;t match the reality (as of 2019), there is a shot of the first &apos;footprints on the moon&apos;, prefiguring one of the most famous images to come from the Apollo 11 landing twelve years later. &apos;Road to the Stars&apos; is the best, most realistic, depiction of the future of space travel as envisioned at the optimistic dawn of the space-age that I have ever seen. Excellent at many levels.",

As for the film itself, it is also powered by some fine acting from Marie Kean, and the motivations are interesting for each and every character - the film is a study of why different persons do what they do and what they expect in return. Sadly the snail&apos;s pacing is a bit slow for the material to have vigor, and some techniques used do not come off well, such as the melding of flashbacks and double narration with two characters each saying their thoughts. The gloom and anger in the film tend to verge on the excessive, but yet these sad emotions bring extra power to the story, and there really is not much of a story - in terms of events - to work with, but the film manages to do a satisfactory job. However, to call Smith satisfactory would not be justice at all. She is simply wonderful, in one of her last great performances, and the film is worth seeing for her work in it alone.",

For someone who wasn&apos;t old enough to attend their shows when Jerry Garcia died, it offers a good introduction to their artistry and their appeal.\n\nThe highlights of the concert are in the second half, with some excellent drum improvisation on &quot;Rhythm Devils&quot; by Mickey Hart and Billy Kreutzmann. Their performance takes on an almost jazz-like quality as two drummers riff off each other. There is also a great rendition of &quot;Fire on the Mountain.&quot; The film also features a few comic bits by Al Franken, pre-SNL and Senate. All in all, well worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Considered brutal and scary in the day of its initial release, &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; was a ground-breaking film with its look into the horrors of a mental institution. Giving the film its vibrancy and life is the elegant Olivia De Havilland. This fine actress goes to town in this fascinating portrait of a young woman, Virginia Stuart, who, soon after marriage to the handsome Robert Cunningham (Mark Stevens) , descends into a world of paranoia and insanity. He takes her to an institution, but conditions there are foreign to Virginia. This Hollywoodization of life in a mental hospital, though tame compared to reality, still packs a punch. We follow this delusional woman as she tries to come to grips with where she is, falls in love with her kind-hearted doctor, Mark Kirk (Leo Genn), befriends other patients, and tries to hide out in the hospital.  Celeste Holm has a minor, but welcome role as Grace, a fellow patient who takes a liking to and protects the confused Virginia.\n\nWhat a score for the lovely De Havilland! She really gets to show her stuff in this emotional role, and got an Oscar-nomination for her efforts. And kudos to director Anatole Litvak for a wonderful, but hard-to-take visit into a woman&apos;s not-all-there mind and her institutionalized world.",

      "reviewBody": "Almost 3 weeks ago, I attended a screening from Ain&apos;t It Cool News to see Henry Selick&apos;s latest film, &apos;Coraline.&apos; I was excited because the screening would showcase the film in 3-D technology, and there was the chance to do a Q&amp;A with Director Henry Selick (unfortunately due to bad weather, Mr. Selick did not make it to our screening).\n\nBefore going in to see &apos;Coraline,&apos; I had read the book on which the film was based. While many acclaimed it for it&apos;s storyline, I found it rather dull and predictable. I&apos;ve been surrounded by fans of Neil Gaiman&apos;s work, though so far had never picked up a book written by him (though &apos;American Gods&apos; did pique my interest).\n\nGoing into the film, I was not quite sure what to expect. I had had tastes of the film from the trailers, but the general consensus was that Henry Selick had tarnished Gaiman&apos;s story, turning it into &apos;Disney fodder.&apos; The truth is: the film manages to be both charming and creepy.\n\nFor those not in the know, &quot;Coraline&quot; tells the tale of Coraline Jones, who moves to a new town and a house with several strange characters. As well, Coraline&apos;s parents just seem to have no time for her, and so she takes to exploring her new abode by herself. In her exploration, she uncovers a small door in the house, which seems to lead to nowhere. But upon revisiting the door late at night, it opens onto a parallel world that is much more whimsical and fun than the real world.\n\nThe one difference is that in the &apos;Other World,&apos; almost all the inhabitants have buttons for eyes. But still, the other parents in this world pay attention to Coraline, and the rather blasé atmosphere of the real world is electrified with color and interesting flights of fancy. It seems just so perfect...or is it? Henry Selick manages to take Neil Gaiman&apos;s story, and crafts a world that just seems to take great advantage of stop-motion in a world where the obvious choice would be to go for a totally computer-generated world. Seeing minute details such as Coraline&apos;s clothing made of actual material makes the world seem even more magical, where invisible giants manipulate the Lilliputians in this miniature world.\n\nDakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, and a number of other vocal actors give voice to a number of wonderful characters, with Hatcher really doing double and triple-duty with her vocal talents. Fanning on the other hand, fleshes out a character that seemed rather dull in Gaiman&apos;s work. Her voice gives Coraline the life that I didn&apos;t think was possible.\n\nOne unsung hero (along with the countless animators who will be passed over in the press junkets) is the composer, Bruno Corlais. Mr. Corlais had never crossed my ears until the screening, but his music lends a touch of brilliance to the film, and makes it seem almost like a European production. Growing up in he US in the early 80&apos;s, I saw a number of stop-motion productions from Europe that played on the Nickelodeon show &apos;Pinwheel.&apos; Corlais&apos; music just transported me to that simpler of times when music didn&apos;t need to be &apos;commercial.&apos; His score really helps to establish the world as well, and uses some instruments that may sound foreign to American ears.\n\nAnd if anyone is questioning if the 3-D is worth it-it is! This isn&apos;t the fly-in-your-face #-D that was seen 2-3 decades ago. It&apos;s subtler, but gives dimension to the miniature world of &apos;Coraline.&apos; I think if you showed this film to a child in 3-D, they&apos;d go home dreaming of creating their own little worlds of stop-motion puppets.\n\nFor the year 2009, &apos;Coraline&apos; so far (as of 2/6/09), is my first enjoyable film experience. I&apos;m hoping my other upcoming film hopefuls (Watchmen, Up, Transformers 2) will also make me feel as positive.",

      "reviewBody": "This serial was produced by Victory Pictures, another one of the famed &quot;Poverty Row&quot; studios of the 1930s and 40s. The storyline centers around Sir James Blake, a retired and renowned law enforcement officer, brilliantly played by Herbert Rawlinson. Blake and his group are assigned to investigate the disappearance of a ray machine that was designed by an engineer (Ralph Byrd) that was to be used by the armed forces in combat. The henchmen, led by The Scorpion(who relies on a black hat, mask and a claw-like glove, give this group a real run for the money.\n\nThe settings take place in an eerie boarding house, complete with secret passages, rooms equipped so that one can observe and hear what goes on in the room below (this is one way that they keep tabs on each other), and the all-time cellar with the long stairway that leads into the river where a boat awaits the getaway. Each character adds meaning to the film except I don&apos;t understand why little Dickie Jones would be a part of this undertaking (he&apos;s Sir James&apos; nephew) but he manages to be a big help to the law. Sam Flint plays Police Inspector Henderson (oh, Superman! Where are you????) who works closely with Sir James &amp; the others. The key henchmen are played to perfection by Ted Lorch and Dick Curtis, both naturals for the roles. \n\nI have to agree with a previous reviewer about the fight scenes. There are some, but no where near as many as in the Republic serials. In those, there&apos;s a fight very 5 minutes which gets tired after a while; in this serial, the fights are spaced out evenly throughout the film, keeping the suspense level high. And speaking of Sir James and Inspector Henderson, those two gray-haired seniors hold their own during the fights. Sir James has one particular gritty tussle with a big brute of a guy (the mute and monster-like son of the boarding house owner who is also in cahoots with the henchmen)and manages to win! The down side of the fight scenes is that the fighting is done in slap-style, not closed fist, unlike the Republic fights, which made for a bit of chuckling while I watched it. \n\nThe film quality is dark at times but watchable. There were times that I had to get close to my screen to see what was doing on but those scenes were very few.\n\nI recommend this if you&apos;re in the mood for good, classic action from the 1930.",

Apparently, the lord of the manor has been mistreated or privy to the shenanigans of about five people and seeks revenge from the grave on them. One is his unfaithful wife, Steele. Each murder is set up in some bizarre way, each person murdered in an ugly, undignified way. There&apos;s always something in me that says, &quot;Did they really deserve to die, or could he have cast them into some legal trap, like the Count of Monte Cristo. But death it is. Some of the people who die are not horrible people, but it doesn&apos;t matter. This guy has powers in the great beyond. What about his soul, one full of vengeance. Why have the spirits allowed him to be so heartless and venomous. The two good people, are a young lawyer and the daughter of the castle&apos;s former resident. She is tiresome and rather insipid. He is mostly confused. Nobody in his right mind should still be in that castle. But it is quite scary and visually impressive. It&apos;s worth an hour and a half.",

These pictures are documentaries as well as propaganda...with a strong emphasis on propaganda in order to bolster support for the war effort. Of the seven films, perhaps &quot;The Battle of Russia&quot; is the one which emphases propaganda much more than facts. Using selective information, the film makes a strong message--our friends, the Russians, are plucky and will NOT roll over for the invading Germans...and they need our help. To make message, the film strongly emphasizes some facts while ignoring the many bad things about Stalinist Russia...such as repression, the Russia-Germany non-aggression pact and Stalin himself. This isn&apos;t too surprising, as Hollywood did an about face with Russia during the war. While pre- war films, such as &quot;Comrad X&quot;, made fun of the Soviets and mocked their system, now that they were allies in the war, a new and ridiculously idealistic view of the USSR made its way into movies such as &quot;The North Star&quot;. After all...they were now the American&apos;s new strange bedfellow. And, it&apos;s because of the combinations of truths and many half truths and omissions that the film is only fair despite its strong message.",

After some so called &apos;Ostalgic&apos; movies (from German Ost meaning East), which all told stories about and in the GDR, as if it had been a strange fairy tale country, this movie was different. At one point it shows the brutality of the totalitarian zero-tolerance system of the GDR at the start of the 60ies and at the same time it tells a differentiated love story. After the &apos;rote Kakadu&apos; I was more than cured of all Ostalgia and understood more about the relationship between men and women, and strangely at the same time I was entertained extremely well! If I had to recommend a movie, as the critical person I am, I would recommend this movie to everyone, who wants to understand a bit more.",

From here in the heart of the disappearing textile industry, Norma Rae rings truer than true. The first time I saw the movie, it was like looking out the window of my three-room mill house and seeing my neighbors. When Normae Rae is in the bar discussing her husband&apos;s death, she was a carbon copy of one of my friends -- swigging beer and having sex to forget about the problems of life. The reaction of people to the union was so typical. Most people didn&apos;t and still don&apos;t want to hear anything about it, afraid it would lead to a shut-down.\n\nFinally, a commentary on the 2004 review by jslack. For the most part, I agree with it. But not about Ron Leibman being either miscast or unattractive. I&apos;m curious to know if jslack is a man or a woman. Of course, Leibman of 1979 is not classically handsome, but he has a bearing and charisma that is almost breathtaking. I can&apos;t imagine anyone else in the role. The point is his difference, that he&apos;s not the same as all the cookie-cutter good old boys. This is not an affair of bodies or even hearts. It&apos;s an affair of the minds."

The line dies and Mrs. Park is attacked and killed by a ghost. On the next morning, the teenager Jae-yi Yoon (Kang-hie Choi) waits for her friend Ji-oh Lim (Gyu-ri Kim), who has the ability to call the spirits, and they begin a close friendship. The abusive and aggressive Mr. Oh, a.k.a. Mad Dog, is the substitute of Mrs. Park and prohibits Ji-oh to paint and compares the performances of the pretty So-young Park (Jin-hie Park) and the weird Jung-sook Kim(Ji-hye Yun), raising a barrier between the two former friends. Miss Hur misses her former friend Jin-ju, who committed suicide, and while trying to contact her, she discloses a dark secret about the past of her friend and Mrs. Park.\n\nI believe that the first point that impresses in &quot;Yeogo Goedam&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Whispering Corridors&apos;, at least for Westerns, is the abusive treatment spent by the teachers with their students, brutally spanking and offending the harmless girls. I do not know if it is usual and acceptable this behavior of teachers, or if the intention of the director is to criticize and denounce how terrible this type of education might be. The story about friendship, needy and revenge has a magnificent cinematography, movements and angles of camera and some subtle insinuation of lesbianism. The performances are very convincing and my vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

      "reviewBody": "Whoever knows Germany, knows that Bavarians (like me) are a little different from the other Germans. One one side very traditional, on the other hand forward looking, always trying to combine modern times with the good ol&apos;times. Josef Vilsmeier - like every Bavarian - loves his homeland, and so he just wants to depict his homeland in a cinematic way. He spent dozens of hours in a helicopter over Bavaria, only shortly interrupted by short pauses in which he shows images of a few larger cities or certain points of interest or to show images of typical Bavarian tradition, and watching the beautiful images, they are simply great and show the beauty of our homeland. But still - a lot of things are missing, and some of the text spoken by the director himself leave a foul taste.... To the things missing: there are almost no informations to Bavarian history. The traditions shown in the film are mainly catholic Christian traditions, besides, there is a lot more in Bavaria than the Oktoberfest. There is a clear dominance to the city of Munich (more than a fourth of the film), which is the hometown of the director, but Bavaria is definitely not only Munich! And, two of the more peripheral regions of the country of Bavaria (the &quot;Oberpfalz&quot; and the &quot;Allgäu&quot; or Bavarian Swabia) are only mentioned very shortly, typical for the pure Bavarian, that considers himself somehow to be in the middle of everything. And this is where the film and some of the director&apos;s remarks leave a bad taste: he mentions Bavaria to be the &quot;Land with the most economic power in Europe&quot; &quot;the best of the world&quot; - come on, I am a Bavarian, but mainly, I&apos;m German! Germany is a independent country, not Bavaria, it&apos;s just a part of Germany. And Germany - like all countries - has other beautiful places as well. A certain patriotism is good, but I personally despise this strong feeling of &quot;Bavarian supremacy&quot;. In conclusion: beautiful pictures, no equilibrium in documentation, lack of historic details, other people of Bavaria than the dominating Bavarians and Frankonians clearly underrepresented. And someone outside Bavaria will definitely be disgusted by this tone of Bavarian supremacy. At school the teacher would say: insufficient work, Grade E (or Note 5 in Germany), sit down.",

From the opening scene, we already have a pretty good idea of the surprise involving the girl&apos;s secretive parents (played by Clu Gulager -- excellent in &quot;Return of the Living Dead,&quot; but just mediocre here -- and Vera Miles from &quot;Psycho&quot;), but there&apos;s another twist at the very end that, in spite of some clunky hints here and there, is impossible to see coming (it&apos;s hardly fair, but it still provides a bit of a jolt.)  With all the background and character development out of the way in the first half hour or so, we finally get to the more-familiar second half, where a group of sorority babes (including Zuniga) and frat boys break into a department building at night as part of an initiation stunt and are subsequently killed off by a maniac who uses a variety of gardening tools and other sharp objects.  People are shot with arrows, shot with guns, shot with spears, stabbed, axed, and decapitated until the surprise killer is finally revealed (and it&apos;s probably not who you think.)  Gaping plot holes abound, but, all in all, this one isn&apos;t too bad (and, besides, you&apos;re not supposed to pay attention to that kinda stuff in these kindsa movies anyway.)\n\nHIGHLIGHT:  The pretty, blonde sorority girl happens to be holding the public address intercom microphone when she is attacked at the security guard&apos;s booth, and her shrieks echo throughout the entire building."

      "reviewBody": "At the start of this Lone Star cheapie, the Duke strays into Roy Rogers territory as he warbles in a worryingly light voice while trotting along on his trusty steed - and one can only speculate on how foolish he must have felt. Thankfully, our hero quickly becomes too involved with a crooked rodeo gang to &apos;entertain&apos; us with any more serenades as he &apos;bulldogs&apos; and &apos;Roman Rides&apos; and does all the other things an honest cowboy has to do to get in with a gang of crooks.\n\nSubsequent fame has given us a kinder opinion of Wayne than he probably deserves in terms of his potential in these early days. Ford saw something there, but nobody else in Hollywood did, and Wayne spent most of the 30s trudging from one no-budget potboiler to another. He&apos;s better than most of the cast in this flick, but there&apos;s little to indicate the massive star power he would one day possess - it&apos;s only his size that seems to give him a presence (and that, if truth be told, is what Wayne was - a screen presence rather than an accomplished actor).\n\nAll these flicks were padded out with interminable shots of cowboys riding very fast on their horses, and this one&apos;s no different. But in this one we&apos;re also treated to lengthy scenes of rodeo riders - which are actually more interesting than the horse-riding fillers, even though the numerous shots of men twisting steers&apos; necks to near-impossible angles in order to floor them and prove their macho status are not pleasant to watch. And the Indians - who were rarely a feature in the Lone Star flicks - are relegated to the status of rodeo sideshow acts here.\n\nTHE MAN FROM UTAH is by no means the worst of the Lone Stars pics (of the ones I&apos;ve seen, that particular wooden spoon is reserved for RANDY RIDES ALONE) although the superhuman status given to Wayne&apos;s character is a bit over the top. Probably the best from this era is THE LUCKY TEXAN, so if, for some bizarre reason, you&apos;re in a position to choose between the two, be sure to plump for the Texan.",

      "reviewBody": "Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank), some sort of scientist, is called to a Southern town to explain the onset of their rivers turning into what looks like blood. Although Winter is not religious (she has a very interesting theory about the ten plagues of Egypt that I found fascinating) she starts to become involved in a Biblical scenario anyway when the ten plagues happen one by one.\n\nI remember seeing the trailer for this in the theater and saying to myself how awful this looked. Just really boring and starring Swank, who I have little or no use for. Even the name &quot;The Reaping&quot; I found weak, thinking it could sell more with a death metal name like &quot;Death to the First Born&quot;. But, I am pleased to say whatever I thought of the trailer, the actual film was far more enjoyable and while nothing really mind-blowing, it definitely met my needs for a horror film.\n\nAny time you have ten plagues visiting a town, you have a good plot already made out for you -- frogs, blood, insects and more! This story also throws in a crazy religious sect and a town secret, so if you&apos;re into cult movies (literally) you will enjoy this more. The plagues, I must say, were done very well -- from the beginning with the river of blood, I felt this film had a good shot of being a winner. I was quite disappointed with the locusts (I can let the fact they&apos;re computerized slide, but the animator made it too obvious). Other than that, it&apos;s alright...\n\nI guess my only other concern (this is a straight-forward film, so there&apos;s not much to discuss) is the religious aspect. Religion and horror go hand in hand. There&apos;s the running themes of Christianity actually working (such as &quot;The Exorcist&quot;), Jesus or God being dead (&quot;Hellraiser&quot; and perhaps &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;) and your religious fanatics who take God&apos;s word in a very bad way. \n\nThis film does a mixture of the first and third, and I&apos;m not sure if I really think it works. I mean, it works for the film, but it may not work for me -- you have a horror movie that seems to have the subtle intention of making the viewer believe in God (because an atheist faces God-given plagues). Yet, you have the God in this film being a very unlikable agent (because of the plagues). So, it leaves you with very mixed feelings on whether this is a pro- or anti-religion film. But maybe the less than crystal plot is a good thing.\n\nAnyway, while I had my doubts and I have my concerns and it&apos;s not the movie of the year by any means... this is still a good film. I think you&apos;ll be pleased with what you see. Talking with others who have seen this one, it seems to get a similar reaction from them: a disposable, yet not worthless, religious-themed horror film. If you&apos;ve been curious, give it a spin.",

(Heath Ledger... what talent!)\n\nThe film begins as a surfing movie, then transitions into skateboarding, but the execution is amazing. I hardly watch movies without checking the time left, due to my incessant need to know everything, yet I didn&apos;t feel inclined to do so during this film. What that means is that the film has a perfect flow, it will keep you interested throughout the entire film.\n\nIt&apos;s a fictionalized film of &quot;The Z-Boys&quot; and how they revolutionized the sport of skateboarding. The film has much to do with skateboarding, but the main scenes are coming-of-age related and it really shows the simplicity of life that we take advantage of. There&apos;s many things you can take from this film: from fame, fortune, and success to humbleness, health, and friendship.\n\nI thought this film would be a somewhat decent, but I was so wrong, it is an inspirational and interesting piece of art. I highly recommend this film if you have an open mind. If you aren&apos;t moved by the end, then you aren&apos;t human.",

      "reviewBody": "O Principio da Incerteza is a film that, probably, most people will not understand, nor appreciate. It is no more and no less then art, and, thus, it is no more, and no less, then life. To achieve a proper explanation of what this film is, or of what it is about, it would be necessary to understand the nature of cinema itself as form of art.\n\nThe plot is quite interesting, as it is also the idea contained by the film. In fact, in the beginning of the story we are given what seem to be very marked and strongly defined characters. For instance it is immediately noticeable the attempt to associate some characters with their contrasting personas  represented in the opposition between the two women, between the two men and between the housekeeper and the Mother of the family.\n\nAs the film progresses the behaviour of the characters seems to evolve, and at least apparently, in a contradictory manner. So, not only the &quot;manichean&quot; view of the characters that we are presented with in the beginning of the film is discarded later on, but also the personalities of the characters appears to suffer from some form of mutation that leads them closer to what was their opposite. With one exception though: Camile, the main character, and the only true archetype. Only one catch: such archetype is constructed from within that persona, which, naturally, not only makes it impossible for the other characters in the film to understand her, but it also implies that solely by intuition, and not by a classical logic construction, we can catch a glimpse of her nature.\n\n&quot;O Principio da Incerteza&quot;, or &quot;the uncertainty principle&quot; is actually a cinematic representation of Werner Heisenberg&apos;s quantum physic&apos;s principle: The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known.",

      "reviewBody": "From the way the critics have gone after &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; you&apos;d think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.\n\nAs a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they&apos;ve paid good money to receive.\n\nIt would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man&apos;s granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.\n\nDespite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say &quot;unprecedented&quot; - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn&apos;t being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer&apos;s 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.\n\nThe movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a &quot;Golly, gee, could it mean_______?&quot; attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it&apos;s the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.\n\nTom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.\n\nThe religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn&apos;t have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.\n\nThe rest of us can appreciate &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; of whodunits.",

Typical underdog story that I have always been a sucker for and this one is no exception. Has that &quot;Rocky&quot; feel to it with shades of countless other inspirational sports stories from seemingly the beginning of films. It is good at capturing the intensity of Philadelphia sports fans and also excellent at showing how blue collar folks in that part of the country interact, socialize and often struggle to make a living. If nothing else, &quot;Invincible&quot; displays just how imperative and key that professional sports are to many within certain U.S. metropolitan areas. 4 stars out of 5."

The colors alone are most delicious! Sadly, we don&apos;t get such colors anymore, sometimes those digital recordings and their coloring (if not &quot;spiced up&quot; in digital post-production) really just look flat and destroy any &quot;vibe&quot;. Anyway, if you like adventures on the sea of long gone times, some swashbuckling and a lot of gun powder smoke, this one is made for you. This one ages well with every decade past. Note: the movies made for TV starring Ioan Gruffudd are also entertaining ones.",

      "reviewBody": "When you have the pairing of Tatsuya Nakadai and Hideko Takamine, you have magic. This absorbing drama spans 29 years of a relationship between Heibei (Nakadai) and Sadako (Takamine) in which they more or less despise each other. The relationship was built on a lie from the beginning as Heibei, returning home from war a semi-cripple (he needs a cane) tells Sadako that her boyfriend Takashi (Keiji Sada), who was still at war, was probably killed. Obviously, he wants Sadako for himself. He rapes her and a pregnancy happens. Takashi comes back not wounded and finds out and vows they will flee together, but this never happens. So, in five distinct chapters, you see this couple&apos;s marriage as what it really is: Filled with resentment, regret and overall enmity. There is not one chuckle in this film (in other words, its not over the top like &quot;The War Of The Roses&quot;). However, its so well acted by all three principal actors and it does not have a dull moment. Its about so many things. Mr. Kinoshita wrote and directed, doing a great job. Again, not a fun film, but for a fan of Nakadai, Takamine or even Mr. Sada, it is fairly essential viewing. I recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Intriguing hybrid adventure, as much a ripping yarn as a western.\n\nUnredeemed human suffering, violence, lust and betrayal – this could be a spaghetti western inspired by Dostoevsky. \n\nIn a recent interview, Franco Nero contrasted the Hollywood western hero with the Italian spaghetti western hero:– the former is indeed a hero, while the latter is more a &apos;son-of-a-bitch&apos;. Yet Nero plays no such &apos;son-of-a-bitch&apos; role in this film. Trauma and tragedy are his lot. Nero&apos;s attitude to the marketing fixation with the &apos;Django&apos; name was simply – &apos;It&apos;s their problem&apos;. He maintains that he only ever made one &apos;Django&apos; film, and it certainly was not this one, so don&apos;t be taken in by the German title of &apos;Mit Django kam der Tod&apos; (&apos;With Django Came Death&apos;).\n\nIt is hard to believe that such awesome landscapes exist within our very own EU (shot in Andalucia!). I particularly enjoyed the careful rationing of images of water, which contrasted so starkly with the bone-dry natural setting. The change of location from Spain to Mexico in the uncut German version gets away with murder. For example, one scene showing the longing for an escape from an outlaw&apos;s exile in the desert is expressed in some shot-reverse-shot images of a tortured gaze at flamingos taking off from a lake. The birds are fortunately native to both Spain and Mexico... \n\nGypsies too are native to both – though our Carmen (i.e. Django&apos;s &apos;Conchita&apos; in the uncut German) would be a rather Spanish-looking gypsy for Mexico, were it not for the black mourning clothes she wears in remembrance of her mother. The Italian-to-German dubbing has been done to a high standard – no mean feat considering that the names of characters and locations have also been altered in the German. Soldiers of the Spanish Bourbon regime must have had uniforms that almost pass for those of the US Civil War – or can some military history hack out there expose the shameless German tampering ...?",

First, I have seen it in 1985, when in Romania a dark dictatorship saved hard currency by preventing foreign films to be imported. It was presented during a festival arranged by the Italian Embassy. Combine the local cultural desert and the post-modern style of this film and you&apos;ll understand why, after the film ended, I wanted to have just a walk-on part on it. My wife just proposed to pay the projectionist to run it again. The second comment is about a strange premonition Fellini had about the conflict in Serbia/Yougoslavia. Each time I see &quot;E la nave va&quot;, I&apos;m deeply moved about the ending, masterly contrasting bold opera music and the vanishing of a certain Europe.",

There&apos;s a car-motorcycle chase scene in the middle of this that was apparently shot in a day, but it is so crisply shot and edited, it easily outdistances a lot of similar chases in much more expensive films.\n\nThis is both a bit of a nod to &quot;blaxploitation&quot; and a comic remark on it. The weakness of the film is that it is on the same terrain as Keenan Wayan&apos;s &quot;Low Down Dirty Shame&quot; but lacks Wayan&apos;s ability to draw out the most from every little comic bit. Other&apos;s have remarked how silly some of the scenes are - well, they&apos;re supposed to be silly, they just aren&apos;t silly enough.\n\nStill, I find the film very likable despite its failings. The characters are not very deep, but they are appealing. The pace I think is generally good, and the camera-work and editing are excellent.\n\nDon&apos;t be mean-spirited about this film; it could have been better, but it is still very entertaining.",

Sally Field was beyond perfect. The love scene in this movie was superflous and not really needed and seemed to me a bit off-center to the plot of the movie itself. The last scene in this movie got me right where I live. My heart constricted at the ending and, I am not ashamed to say, tears fell from my eyes. Right now as I talk about it my eyes tear up. I am happy that Sally Field won an Oscar for her portrayal of a depression-era wife and mother for she earned it ten times over. In the last scene a bible verse was quoted and I would love to know,again, what it was and where it is located in the bible. It had to do with glass and cymbals. Could anyone help out? Thanks."

This is nuts and bolts late 80&apos;s early 90&apos;s action B-movie fun right from the very beginning. Van Damme is on physical top form with some impressive moves from the many fights featured, the story is good simple action movie stuff, and even though this is clearly a lowish budgeted film it&apos;s always watchable and entertaining. Performance wise this isn&apos;t anything of course worth speaking of, but Harrison Page is good fun as the sleazy manager, while Deborah Rennard gets plenty of screen time wearing some of the periods&apos; more curious fashions. Overall any true of Mr Damme should certainly check this out.",

      "reviewBody": "Coming of age movies have become a rare genre and excellent ones even rarer. My Extraordinary Summer with Tess deserves a place with the classics, a near perfect C of A movie.\n\nTo begin with, the scenery around the Dutch island is fabulous. I always wondered what those Friesland islands look like, and now I know. Miles of nearly empty white sand beaches, but beware of the muddy quicksand at low tide, as you will see. In addition, the lighthouse becomes, to me, an important character.\n\nEleven-year-old, Josephine Arendsen plays Tess and switches between moods lightning fast. Unlike many off the present day crop of Coming of Age movies, she is utterly real. Not adorable, not particularly feminine or pretty, or nerdy, she just comes across as a real person. I suppose my favorite part is when she shows Sam, the young boy who falls in love with her, her diary documenting the search for her father. Sam, bumbles his way through being Tess&apos; companion in her search, his relationship with her echoing through his head while he wanders the island training himself to be alone.\n\nI am not much of a reviewer, but since this movie doesn&apos;t seem to have a review, and was featured on IMDb today, I wanted to let folks know that I have included my copy along with the best of Coming of Age movies and highly recommend it.",

The apple in question is a version of the one offered to Adam, but the story is modernized and really quite funny, proving that Helmut Käutner, who began his career as a member of a topical cabaret group, was not only the great master of cinematic poetry but also of sharp and witty allegory. The film has aged quite well, mainly because there&apos;s nothing to compare it to - that kind of film-making is long forgotten. The viewer doesn&apos;t even have to know too much about the situation in Germany back in 1948 - as always, Käutner distances himself from the present &quot;reality&quot; and shows us an alternative view of existence, which transcends time. The film cries out for colour, but that of course was quite impossible three years after the collapse of Germany and its blooming film industry.",

      "reviewBody": "The film takes one on a whirlwind journey of what happened not just in Ethiopia but the generation of that age. It is a sharp commentary on communism&apos;s excess. After all this was the era during which Italy&apos;s Red Brigade and Germany&apos;s Baader-Meinhof were coming into their own terrorizing their home communities. A film that tries to do justice to such a deeply felt wound in the Ethiopian and world psyche can be forgiven a few excesses, chief among which is its length.\n\nThe film is artistically well thought out, and one can tell Gerima had plenty of time during those 14 years to develop his ideas and refine them. It does not try to be clever except when it combines the protagonists problems with racial problems then existent in Germany. And by the way, there was an Ethiopian man that was thrown off a balcony around that time. The only difference is that in real life the man did not survive the fall.\n\nThis film is not for shrinking violets or those in denial. And those whose revisionism allows them the myopia of seeing those times in a golden light will find the stark reality of those violent times too accessible to brush away or ignore. \n\nIn all it is a portrait of a place and point in time, of people, a country and ideals that are no longer with us.\n\nBravo to Gerima and all who help present this palpable, smoothly told(overall) story of a neglected and wasted time.",

The story is simple enough, its the tale of someone who is wrongly accused of a crime in order to satisfy someones higher political manifesto but there&apos;s an ageless quality to it. I&apos;m not particularly clued up on films or politics, and certainly not a critic but I have to say that in these times of arrest without trial or evidence, this film strikes a chord. This film highlights some of the best and worst aspects inherent to human nature, a truly remarkable work.",

      "reviewBody": "Released in 1955 and directed by Tim Whelan, &quot;Rage at Dawn&quot; stars Randolph Scott as a special agent sent to Indiana to infiltrate the notorious Reno Gang, who carried out the first three peacetime train robberies in the USA. The stolen money was largely never recovered. Forrest Tucker plays the top member of the gang, Frank, while Mala Powers plays the honest sister of the brothers, Laura, whom Scott&apos;s character decides to romance.\n\nThere&apos;s only one other movie based on the exploits of the Reno Gang, which was Elvis&apos; debut film &quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; released the year after &quot;Rage at Dawn.&quot; &quot;Rage&quot; is more faithful to the true story, although the special agent played by Scott is fictitious and Laura, while not part of the gang, wasn&apos;t squeaky clean as depicted, plus she was loyal to her brothers. But the movie&apos;s accurate in that Clint Reno (Denver Pyle) refused to be part of the gang and was called Honest Clint, not to mention the notorious ending is faithful to history, albeit no one was apprehended for the &quot;crime&quot; (I&apos;m being ambiguous because I don&apos;t want to give it away).\n\nScott is at his charismatic best here as he romances a girl that&apos;s clearly younger than half his age. Randolph was 56 during filming whereas cutie Mala was 23 (!), but this is okay once you understand that Scott&apos;s character is supposed to be around 35 (even though he looks like he&apos;s at least 50). Forrest Tucker is also great as the malevolent Frank Reno.\n\nUnfortunately, the obvious California locations ruin the movie because the story&apos;s set in the Ohio River region of Indiana, Missouri and surrounding areas, which look nothing like California. Moreover, the last act isn&apos;t very engaging despite the action; it somehow loses the interest attained in the first two acts. Still, &quot;Rage at Dawn&quot; is one of only two movies based on the Reno Gang and it&apos;s the more accurate of the two; not to mention the principle actors are great.\n\nThe movie runs 87 minutes and was shot in Columbia, Sonora &amp; Chico, California.\n\nGRADE: C+",

But, this is just a small part of an amazing and beautiful record of a process that created a song that will last for generations.\n\nWatching the rhythm section work out the song, Mick working out the lyrics, Keith conducting the whole thing, Brian Jones playing remarkable keyboards, reminds us of the process of production. It took time. It took failures and it became an amazing song.\n\nBesides that, the film is so beautifully shot is looks like it came out of an 21st century design magazine.\n\nAnd please don&apos;t ignore the digressions. It is (in my humble opinion) about the appropreation of black culture by whites and white culture by blacks. An interesting diversion when you think about 1968 and Europe and the Americas. We all switch and use and sometimes it makes beautiful music.\n\nThis is an important film that should be seen by anyone going into a studio to record a song that will be remebered forever.\n\n\n* I Am Media Boy.\n"

      "reviewBody": "While I don&apos;t believe in the phrase &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;, if I did, I would use it to describe my love for the movie All American Christmas Carol. This movie is so trashy and so tacky, everyone in my family teases me for liking it so much, and it&apos;s earned the nickname &quot;Trailer Trash Christmas&quot; in my house. Nevertheless, it&apos;s one I look forward to watching every year, albeit all by myself.\n\nCharles Dickens&apos;s classic tale gets a new environment in this movie, and the Scrooge who needs a Christmas makeover is the white-trash Taryn Manning who lives in a trailer park. She teaches her children that &quot;work is for suckers&quot; and uses her idiotic boyfriend for his money while playing around with Alex Solowitz. When she misses out on her son&apos;s school Christmas play because of a late-night rendezvous, she gets visited by three spirits to help change her priorities.\n\nThis version is really different, and I understand why some people can&apos;t stand it. Jake Marley getting killed by a paintball, the Ghost of Christmas Past turning into a drunken, beer-bonging stripper, and a spray-painted Christmas tree might be jarring and ridiculous to some viewers. I see past those changes and find the humor in them. There&apos;s still a do-gooder Bob, a Tiny Tim, and Scrooge&apos;s miserliness. The basic point of the story is still there. Her childhood memories have tainted her views on Christmas, romance, and money, and when you watch them, you understand. The present still reminds her of what she&apos;s lost, and the future still scares her into wanting to change. She&apos;s just dressed in cut-off shorts and has ratted-out hair while she does it. And she says things like, &quot;I can&apos;t believe that dirty ho is trying to steal my man!&quot;\n\nI won&apos;t tell you to give this one a shot if you don&apos;t think you&apos;ll like it. But maybe the next time someone tells you they like it, you&apos;ll understand. Or, if you secretly watch it when no one&apos;s looking, you can take comfort knowing you&apos;re not the only person who loves it.\n\nDLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Each time a ghost is introduced, the camera tilts unexpectedly and it will make you sick. When Taryn wanders down the school corridor alone, cruises the shop aisles alone, and sits in her car alone, look away until the ghosts appear. In other words, &quot;Don&apos;t Look, Mom!&quot;",

I have watched almost all spy movies that came out after first James Bond movies Dr. No. Italian, German, French, British, American etc.. and to me this the best. The story, the script, the sequence of thrilling events that took place in the movie from start till end, makes it undoubtedly the best. The actors make you feel the actions . It is not a boring movie even if you watch it several times. I think the production also fabulous cause almost all scenes were shot in locations on different countries. Really enjoyable to watch.",

      "name": "I Laughed More Watching This Film Than I Have At Anything In Months",
      "reviewBody": "Maybe it&apos;s because I come from Italian heritage that I find this film so funny. I honestly think I laughed out loud during this film one of the highest amounts I&apos;ve ever belly-laughed during a movie. And you know how you laugh later on in a movie when nothing funny is going on because the thought of something hilarious that happened earlier is still stuck with you? Well that happened plenty of times to me here. I believe that it&apos;s because the Southern Italian and Sicilian in me both find fat Italian men to be perhaps the funniest group of people in the world. They are not simply funny because they know how to tell a joke, or they know how to pull off a good pratfall, but more because all you have to do is look at them, and they can make you burst out laughing. There is a scene where Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno, whom I believe plays his wife, sit close together on a small bench in a cemetery facing the camera, and I suddenly started laughing. They look funny. They don&apos;t look weird. They just look like the first thing they say or do is going to make me laugh like a hyena.\n\nEvery scene for the first half of the film, literally every single one, contains something explosively funny to me, and they are mostly consisting of native Italians speaking rough English with thick Italian accents and fulfilling stereotypes of ardent cultural traditions. Hands down, the scenes that made me cackle so hard I thought my friend watching it with me was going to slap me for the unreasonable sound that can cause me to make were the scenes that depict what Italian families are like when the son moves out.\n\nMambo Italiano is also a surprise, because really it doesn&apos;t look that good. On the cover of the DVD case, you see a bunch of characters in some comical motion lined up across the cover, and you feel like you could pretty much guess completely what their service to the story is. Well, you&apos;ll be vaguely right, but if it wouldn&apos;t surprise you too much for me to say this at this point, it&apos;s a very poignant film about growing up as a homosexual surrounded by conflicting influences and pressure. The film will actually make you angry at society and the reality of what friends and family can end up doing to you in your life. But it&apos;s riotous fun.",

Gene Nelson and Phyllis Kirk were also excellent,who would have thought they could do such acting and the cinematography is really something to see--I always wonder when seeing these films, just how many of the buildings are still around. This is a great little film--be sure and catch it if you ever see it on the schedule!!!"

      "reviewBody": "This is the best French movie of the year ! I saw it twice and I found it great both times. I didn&apos;t think it boring at all even though it is very long (3 hours). I&apos;m seventeen so I obviously didn&apos;t get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in French history, but it doesn&apos;t really matter since I still really enjoyed the film. It&apos;s actually quite universal : people of my parents&apos; age can identify to the characters and so can people my age. Garrel seems to perfectly understand young people, the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world. Maybe that&apos;s because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son)is actually meant to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Well anyway, great movie, no action (have to be honest on that point) but so strong feelings that you can&apos;t possibly stay indifferent to it. If you&apos;re looking for a relaxing Sunday-evening movie, don&apos;t waste your time on this, you&apos;ll be disappointed. But if you like cinema, you&apos;ll like Les Amants Réguliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s by the Nouvelle Vague artists.",

      "name": "Not perfect, but Rockwell shines in this fairly well adapted raunchy tale",
      "reviewBody": "Choke tells the story of Victor Mancini (Sam Rockwell), a sex addict working in a colonial times reproduction. His mother, Ida (Anjelica Huston), suffers from dementia, and spends most of her time thinking Victor is someone else (mainly long dead lawyers) during his frequent visits to the hospital. To pay the bills, Mancini has a bit of a unique talent: he chokes on food in swanky restaurants, and practically forces innocent bystanders into saving him from death.\n\nI read the book Choke a few years ago, thinking it would be same in vain to writer Chuck Palahniuk&apos;s near flawless Fight Club (and of course, David Fincher&apos;s incredible film). But Choke was nothing like it, and anyone going to see the film thinking it will be is in for a disappointment.\n\nBut like Fight Club before it, Choke is adapted quite well from its raunchy source material. The story is quite liberally changed in some instances, but in others, it is an almost literal recreation. Mancini is a well-rounded character, with bizarrely comic traits that are pure Palahniuk. I found myself almost crying from laughing so hard at the comic mishappenings he got himself into, frequently calling back to the events in the book. It was strange however that so little an amount of time is spent on the choking that Mancini has down practically to an art form, but then its off-the-rails, frank portrayal of sex was always much stronger. First-time director Clark Gregg does an excellent job making this character so true to Palahniuk&apos;s work that you can forgive him for glossing off something so integral to the plot (but at least it makes for a whole lot less convoluted, confusing and downright silly third act). Gregg&apos;s addition of the little idiosyncrasies of Mancini&apos;s lifestyle (small cuts to previous sexual encounters, frequent breast-filled day dreams) only further strengthens how close the film cuts to its source material.\n\nBut despite being 92 minutes long, I think Gregg could have done with a touch more editing. The film is not lengthy at all (many sequences practically zip by in the hyper-kinetic sense of Fight Club before it), but the film feels quite long in some instances. Despite their importance to the story, the flashback sequences involving a much younger looking Huston and young Victor (playing by Jonah Bobo) drag on endlessly, nearly losing their train of thought mid-scene. Some of the scenes between Mancini and Ida&apos;s doctor, Paige Marshall (Kelly Macdonald), also have a habit of dragging their heels. Some cuts here and there in these scenes could have only benefited the film. As well, Gregg&apos;s doing away with the third act leaves some subplots hanging in the balance, never to fully integrate themselves with the film as a whole. Non-readers may not even notice some of them (including one glaring omission), but it may strike those who have read it as quite odd.\n\nThe supporting cast is pretty well rounded. Macdonald does a great job in her scenes, as do Bijou Phillips in a small role as one of Mancini&apos;s co-workers, and Gregg himself as the lead character in the colonial times reproduction. I had failed to realize it was him when watching the film, but he brings a special greatness to every one of his character&apos;s lines.\n\nI was a little disappointed however in Brad William Henke&apos;s portrayal of Mancini&apos;s friend Denny however. Not because Henke does a bad job in the role, but because he does not get nearly enough time on screen. He steals many of his scenes, and seems to know just how to frame Denny, frequently shifting from the downtrodden weakling of a sidekick, to the strong willed individual Mancini wishes he could be. Henke is having fun in the goofy role, and it is obvious that he is very comfortable doing it. He does not have a whole lot of credits on his filmography, but I can only help this role makes him a lot more accessible in Hollywood. More scenes could have only reinforced the notion.\n\nHuston, looking much older than usual for the majority of the film, is excellent in her portrayal of Ida. She does not look to be doing much, but the emotions she conveys simply through her facial movements and expressions is enough to suggest that she is doing more than simply phoning in her performance. The role may not seem too tough, but she pulls it off without breaking a sweat. Despite disliking the flashback scenes, they only further developed her character into the closet psycho she is so great at playing.\n\nBut the movie rests on Rockwell&apos;s shoulders, and he is clearly up to the task. The breath of life he gives Victor Mancini is almost poetic in how personal it looks and sounds. No, he does not give the same energy that Brad Pitt does as Tyler Durdan, but this does not seem to bother Rockwell in the least. He plays Mancini just the way he needs to in order to make him a believable regular guy, suffering from addiction problems and his need to please his overbearing mother even as she is slowly withering away. You can see the pain in his face right from minute one, and never once does he let us take this idealism for granted. He uses it and characterizes Mancini with a great breadth of thought not regularly seen in contemporary American cinema.\n\nWhile it is not perfect at all, Choke is a wonderfully valiant attempt at recapturing the nearly demented nature of a Palahniuk book. His unique voice is captured quite fluidly within the film, and writer/director Gregg can be quite proud of his work here. With the help of a great supporting cast, Rockwell practically lights up the screen in a way that only further proves his greatness as an actor.\n\n7/10.",

      "reviewBody": "The Ice Harvest is attractive to two audiences, those being the film noir and/or crime fans and the people who think a movie with Cusack and Thornton directed by ex-Ghostbuster Ramis is going to be a mishap-riddled caper comedy. Unfortunately, this film&apos;s heart lies outside of the compatibility of either. It&apos;s technically not a crime film, because the story begins immediately as the crime ends, a $2 million embezzlement scheme that is never explained. Also, the film is certainly not a comedy within the ballpark of any other work by Harold Ramis. What Ramis has made is a film that is more of a dramatic exercise in cinematic mood and low-key atmosphere. The good news is that he pulls it off very well.\n\nThe Ice Harvest happens to be one of the movies I watch at Christmastime, because the film is actually so well-directed and so well-shot that it captures that constantly sought-after perfect cozy winter atmosphere on film. The events of the story occur over the course of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, all in the small and quiet town of Wichita, KA. No matter how much time it spends during the outlandish drunken bouts of Oliver Platt or the destructive tantrums of Ned Bellamy&apos;s overaggressive bartender, The Ice Harvest never breaks its meticulous feeling and image for one moment.\n\nEven though it&apos;s not what is expected by the vast majority of those who have seen it or those who mean to, it does have impressionistic characteristics of those expectations that deliver sensationally, such as Thornton&apos;s tremendously entertaining time on screen and the thicket of distrust that ushers in over the course of the holidays succeeding his and Cusack&apos;s so-called perfect crime. However, these are purely part of the style rather than the substance. The plot is conjecture of film noir rather than the real deal, as most of the twists are nearly meant to be somewhat obvious or expected. Really, the essence of the story lies in Cusack&apos;s descent into complete detachment from any virtue in life, feeling as if he&apos;s only an observer when encountering darkly humorous yet brooding things over his Christmas.\n\nThe Ice Harvest is not really a comedy and not really a film noir. Actually, it bears no genre per se. Simply, it&apos;s a wonderful installment in the phantom subgenre of cinematic moodiness.",

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re a fan of BELA LUGOSI you&apos;ll get a kick out of his sinister role here as a scientist who is bent on getting revenge because he never got his full share of the profits on his inventions. \n\nGiven the low-budget look and tacky special effects (a live bat appears in close-ups only), the modest little thriller entertains even though it doesn&apos;t quite provide the shudders intended. Still, if you&apos;re in a Halloween mood, you might want to sit through this at least once.\n\nInteresting to note Dave O&apos;Brien in the role of Johnny Layton. O&apos;Brien is familiar to me because of all the Pete Smith Specialties he starred in during the &apos;40s and which TCM has been running frequently. Others will recall him in a bunch of westerns he made at poverty row studios. At any rate, he gives the only really professional performance in the film aside from Bela who seems to relish his role as the mad scientist. Most of the acting among supporting players is on the less than credible side.\n\nAlso interesting to note that O&apos;Brien was a very versatile man who acted, directed and wrote throughout a prolific career that began in the 1930s--with over a hundred films to his credit. He was my main reason for enjoying THE DEVIL BAT."
