      "reviewBody": "Ip Man has quenched our thirst of a real good martial art movie where we don&apos;t just watch man kicking asses but where we can appreciate the man&apos;s moral and virtues.\n\nThe movie flows well, from the view of the kungfu street of Fo Shan, to the introduction of Ip Man, and so on. Scene by scene are there in a well done play, and when someone had to display martial art act, they don&apos;t just throw bunch of minions out from nowhere to have him beating them all over. I think the scenario is well written.\n\nFight choreography is great. Different approach from what we usually see, people doing flashy flying kicks and sorts; since it is about wing chun, feet hardly ever leave the ground but it doesn&apos;t decrease the beauty and flashiness of the fights.\n\nPeople may complain about bits that might not fit the real condition of those era. Well, I think producers have to make sure they made entertaining movies, not documentaries.\n\nLast words, Donnie Yuen has always been a good martial art actor, he just never get the spotlight. And finally as Ip Man he gets to stand on where he deserves.",

Nor there was any good twist or something.\n\nThe movie lacked required voltage and hence it&apos;s average. Director concentrated well on the aspects of framing and bringing richness on to celluloid but didn&apos;t bother much about narration of the movie.\n\nMainly dialogues are routine with no sparks to underline, Cinematography is good and sound effects are average. On a whole the screenplay is straight and flat without any mindblowing twist. Director could have worked more on the departments of dialogues and script. Especially the scene where Satya Raj discovers his son in battered condition is very weak and couldn&apos;t bring in any emotion.\n\nBottom-line : Not Recommended",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s be blunt: this is definitely not a good movie; it&apos;s not horrid either, it&apos;s just somewhere between average and bad. There are quite a few problems. First, with the script, which tries to incorporate all elements of the 1951 movie into a new, updated whole. The end result lacks cohesion and plays more like a sequence of 5 to 10 minutes scenes badly sewn together, the prime objective of each scene being either to introduce an element taken from the original movie or, on the contrary, an idea absent form the1951 original, instead of simply advancing the story. Second, the direction: poor, poor, poor. Third, some of the worst acting I have seen in a mainstream movie for a long time; I found the leads, especially Keanu, quite good but the other actors are decent at best, with Katie Bates delivering a frighteningly catastrophic &apos;performance&apos;. I was not shocked (positively or negatively) by all the other aspects of the film.\n\nComing out of the theater, I found myself pondering about this remake and the 1951 original. I find the Robert Wise movie quite good, but not the masterpiece some claim it to be. I was therefore ready to accept a remake and the few new ideas offered by the 2008 movie made me painfully aware that a remake could indeed have been interesting, had it been put in better hands or, if I dare say so, in much better hands. So, to me, it&apos;s another sadly missed opportunity.",

      "reviewBody": "LUCKY BREAK is Peter Cattaneo&apos;s follow-up to his hugely successful 1997 comedy THE FULL MONTY, which I thought was great.  Unfortunately his second stint behind the camera isn&apos;t half as successful.  The main problem with this comedy is simple: it&apos;s not funny enough.  Yes, there&apos;s a few chuckles but my sides definitely weren&apos;t split... they weren&apos;t even creased.\n\nJames Nesbitt, from TV&apos;s Cold Feet (in the UK), is full of cheeky Irish charm but I didn&apos;t think he cut it as a leading man.  He&apos;s great on TV, but he lacked something on the big screen.  The love interest is provided by the lovely Olivia Williams, who plays the same same sort of role she&apos;s done before, and is fine again here.  Christopher Plummer plays the Prison&apos;s Governor and it&apos;s always good to see him even if the film&apos;s not that great. The rest of the inmates were pretty good, with Bill Nighy&apos;s scene-stealing poncey Roger as the standout.\n\nStorywise it hit all the right notes but, as I&apos;d said, wasn&apos;t nearly funny enough.  There are echoes of MONTY throughout but the production put on by the inmates at the end of the film didn&apos;t work nearly as well as the MONTY finale.  So, overall I&apos;d say it was a bit of a disappointment, which is a bit of a shame."

Its pure propaganda in the &quot;we were right to try these people&quot; sort of way and is clearly biased against the defendants who had just set Europe aflame. The take is rather odd and unlike any thing that I&apos;ve run across in American or in Western European films on the same subject. It seems to be trying to over explain why the leaders of Germany were tried, which in retrospect is painfully obvious. Its clear from the lean toward the Soviet take of events and of its lingering on the speeches by the Soviet prosecutors who was behind the film. Its not bad but the heavy handedness of the presentation becomes wearing after a while.\n\nIf you keep in mind when the film was made its an intriguing look at how the events were viewed during their own historical period. However its probably too long at an hour, with its ponderous preaching taking away from any value the film might have had.",

Unfortunately, for most of its running time, Camp Cuddly Pines offers only one type of &apos;powertool&apos;—and it&apos;s pink and fleshy. And as for the spillage of bodily fluids—well, not much of it is red! With scene after scene of hardcore humping, and nary a graphic death in sight, anyone watching this movie WITHOUT the intention of choking their chicken will be extremely disappointed. In fact, to be honest, even for that purpose, Camp Cuddly Pines is pretty uninspiring, with each sex scene pretty much consisting of the same routine: oral, position A, oral, position B, money shot.\n\nThe cast—your typical assortment of silicone enhanced bimbos and muscle bound studs—struggle admirably to act in between the frenetic shagging, but to be honest, they&apos;re much better at delivering blow-jobs and facials than their lines. Only seasoned porno pro Randy Spears gives anything remotely resembling a decent (non-sexual) performance, and saves the whole mess from being a complete waste of time: his hammy turn as an R. Lee Ermey-style hayseed cop is pretty funny, and his brief tussle with a stuffed raccoon actually made me laugh (and not before time, considering this rubbish is also supposed to be a comedy of sorts).\n\nAs a porn film, I rate Camp Cuddly Pines Powertool Massacre 6/10; as a slasher/horror, I rate it a miserable 1/10 (splashing some fake blood after cutting away from the victim just isn&apos;t enough, I&apos;m afraid); and as a comedy, I give it a rather generous 2 (1 point each for the two R&apos;s—Randy and the Raccoon!). Add those scores up, divide by 3, and we get a disappointing average of 3/10.",

In this one, the protagonist is a teen girl who is a hard-core Ramones fan, and she and her fellow classmates are up against a dictator-like principal who wants to make the school a living hell.  The girl, Riff wants to write music for her favorite band as well.\n\n    Rock &apos;n Roll High School is a really fun, edgy, tongue-in-cheek, feel good kind of movie!  It&apos;s a teen movie I actually enjoy!  Even today&apos;s teens can like this movie, too!  The soundtrack is really enjoyable, and full of songs from The Ramones, Brownsville Station, Alice Cooper, and all those greats from the 1970&apos;s!  It was cool to see Joey Ramone and the others make an appearence.  Sadly, last year we lost Joey to cancer. \n\n     Want to see a real teen comedy?  Then see Rock &apos;n Roll High School! This movie puts all those pathetically unfunny teen comedies  of today (i.e. American Pie) to shame!  I give this 5 stars!"

      "reviewBody": "Veteran actor Peter Cushing depicts Sir John Rowan, an utmost genius and respectable surgeon. The passion for his work is only surpassed by his obsessive love for the lewd photo-model Lynn Nolan. When her pretty face gets badly burned in a very banal accident that Rowan jealously caused at a jet-set party, he swears to restore it. He performs an initially successful operation, using tissue and a particular facial gland of a recently deceased young woman, but the results are only temporary. In order to strengthen and prolong the effect of the gland, our doctor needs to use living tissue instead \n\nThe plot of &quot;Corruption&quot; is one of the most derivative and clichéd ones in horror cinema. In 1959, in France, director Georges Franju delivered the penultimate genre landmark &quot;Les Yeux Sans Visage&quot; – &quot;Eyes without a Face&quot; – and particularly during the next two decades, the tale of fanatic scientists and obsessive surgeons murdering innocent young women in order to restore and maintain the youthful beauty of their own mutilated wives or daughters has been copied numerous times, most notably by Jess Franco (&quot;The Awful Dr. Orloff), Sidney Hayers (&quot;Circus of Horrors&quot;) and Terence Fisher (&quot;The Man who could Cheat Death&quot;). \n\nThis version, helmed by Robert Hartford-Davies, isn&apos;t exactly what you&apos;d call a masterpiece, but it definitely contains a couple of elements that make it noteworthy and recommendable for horror fans. For starters: the almighty Peter Cushing! He&apos;s one of my personal favorite actors of all times and, even though he played a lot of villainous roles in his lengthy career, this one feels rather special. Due to his naturally elegant charisma and typically British appearance and behavior, Cushing usually depicts the &apos;sophisticated&apos; type of villains. You know; the type of evil mastermind who invents fiendish schemes but uses grisly minions to do the nasty work. His character here also seems very sophisticated (so much even that his choice of muse is highly implausible), but when he&apos;s forced to stalk and murder another poor victim to steal her glands, Dr. Rowan transforms into a relentless maniacal beast! The sequences in which the prowling Cushing goes berserk and literally butchers young girls, consecutively a prostitute and a random blond beauty on the train, are excessively vile and misogynic. Cushing, with pure insanity in his eyes and his hair all messed up, savagely stabs them to death and cuts off their heads in ways that are quite graphic for a British film released in 1968. Still, I&apos;m thankful for Cushing&apos;s performance as well as for the gory make- up effects, since the rest of the movie is mediocre at best. The protagonists, Sir John Rowan and Lynn, are a mismatched couple, to say the least, and the extended finale set at Rowan&apos;s beachside cottage is overlong and exaggeratedly far-fetched. Like they haven&apos;t got enough trouble already, Rowan and Lynn are held captive by a troop of anti-menacing thugs and the whole thing ends rather hectically (and foolishly) with an out-of-control laser machine. In case you&apos;re a fan of qualitative British horror from the sixties and seventies, I advise sticking to the Hammer productions or the Amicus anthology films. If, however, you watched all of those already and you want to see a different side of Peter Cushing, then I warmly recommend &quot;Corruption&quot;.",

I even left before the end, something I rarely do, because I was fed up with watching the birds, the zoo animals and the children swimming, while getting no new information about a great city. I wanted to see the architecture before the massive destruction of WW2 and got very little of it. The film was shot in the &apos;50s, so they could have contrasted the before and after periods of important monuments and buildings, but they failed to do this.",

It certainly is no Citizen Kaine &amp; if this Robin Hood does become a trilogy, I do not think it will fair as well as The Lord of the Rings trilogy. One can hope that this Robin Hood will only improve as did TLOTR. Time will tell...\n\nAs stated, the movie was entertaining. As a prequel it set the story to come rather well. It did run a bit long but it is after all, a large tale. As anyone who has ever had a favorite book turned into a film knows, that film rendition is simply not going to have the nuance that one gets from reading a book at your on pace &amp; with your own vision. So many are so disappointed by the lack of that nuance that they simply cant relax &amp; enjoy the vision of a master director such as Ridley Scott.\n\nIt is your loss if you go into this movie with unreasonable expectations that will keep you from enjoying this film.\n\nI give this movie a 7 of 10. There were, IMO a few CGI flaws &amp; a few slow moments. If the tale continues I hope to see more development among the minor characters.\n\nA last thought, if this is the only segment of any proposed trilogy, then this movie is able stand alone.",

Although it has fairly good storyline, it is definitely not as strong as movies such as the Pianist. There is no strong character growth and it is hard to tell who is really the main character. However, it is interesting to watch how the story incorporates drama, musical, and some light humour all into a war-themed movie. I was bit disappointed in the acting, especially the voice acting. The audio almost sounds like as if it was dubbed because the voice you hear does not really go with the character. I would have rather liked if they just spoke in German, not in English. One of the main reason I watched it was because of Heino Ferch. Unfortunately, his acting seems bit artificial when compared to his acting in der Untergang and der Tunnel.\n\nOverall, it is a good film that could have been better.",

      "reviewBody": "Okay, right off the bat, Paramount&apos;s all-star costume party is no substitute for the Alice books. Perhaps the eccentric literary genius of Lewis Carroll simply can&apos;t be properly recreated in a screen adaptation. No one&apos;s managed it yet, at any rate (though I&apos;d like to see the Brothers Quay take a crack at it). Nevertheless this curious film version is worth seeing, especially for animation &amp; special effects buffs, fans of Hollywood stars from the early talkie era, and connoisseurs of offbeat cinema. Even fans of &apos;30s horror flicks should take a look, because this film is closer to those works in spirit than you might expect. Although I haven&apos;t seen the Paramount ALICE IN WONDERLAND in years there are elements I recall vividly, and they tend to be the frightening or bizarre moments: Alice&apos;s blurry transformations in size; Humpty Dumpty&apos;s spindly legs flailing as he tumbles backward off his wall; a puppet-like Alice sailing down the stairs, out the door and landing on the walk; the Mock Turtle sobbing weirdly as he sings of Beautiful Soup; and, most vivid of all, that horrible-looking piece of mutton sprouting a face and complaining when Alice attempts to slice into him.\n\n20 year-old Charlotte Henry is pretty and sweet as Alice, decidedly sweeter than the stubbornly logical Alice of the books. To play the denizens of Wonderland and the Looking Glass World (realms jumbled together into a single patchwork Crazy Quilt here) the studio trotted out most of its contract stars to don heavy disguises, and the result is kind of like seeing all your favorite teachers participate in a school Christmas pageant. Some of them pull it off better than others. Perhaps the best-remembered casting is W.C. Fields as an especially cantankerous Humpty Dumpty. It&apos;s a memorable sequence alright, but somehow unsatisfying and even a little disturbing; Fields was too constrained by his makeup and the necessity of following Carroll&apos;s famous dialog to make the character his own. Interestingly, according to James Curtis&apos; recent biography, Fields thoroughly hated this assignment and performed his scene in an ugly humor.\n\nThe scenario is disjointed, but some scenes are unforgettable. Cartoon buffs will want to tune in for The Walrus and The Carpenter sequence, introduced by Tweedle-Dumm &amp; Tweedle-Dee (i.e. actors Jack Oakie and Roscoe Karns) wearing such cumbersome-looking rubber masks that we worry about their ability to breathe properly. The animators responsible for this sequence received no screen credit, and for a long time I was under the impression it was the work of the Fleischer Studio (whose output was distributed by Paramount) but apparently it was produced by Hugh Harman &amp; Rudolf Ising, who were affiliated with producer Leon Schlesinger prior to this period. It&apos;s interesting to speculate how ALICE IN WONDERLAND might have turned out if the entire film had been animated, with Paramount&apos;s contract stars simply supplying the voices. This was still several years prior to Disney&apos;s breakthrough feature SNOW WHITE, so the result could have been a groundbreaking milestone in animation, and perhaps more appealing than the adaptation Disney eventually released in the early &apos;50s. As it stands, this live action version features masks and costumes clearly modeled on the books&apos; original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel, and offers the amusing game of figuring out which actor is under which disguise. Some of the players (Edward Everett Horton, Edna May Oliver) are more recognizable than others (Cary Grant, Sterling Holloway). The casting doesn&apos;t always make sense, but Gary Cooper&apos;s befuddled White Knight comes off surprisingly well, and arguably steals the show.\n\nThe Paramount ALICE IN WONDERLAND has never been available in any official VHS or DVD release, although I believe collectors would snap it up if it were properly restored. One problem I recall from the TV viewings of my childhood was that the picture was badly cropped, cutting off significant amounts of image, a particular problem during the credits that identify the players. This was done in &apos;Storybook&apos; fashion, with big leaves turning and matching each costumed Wonderland character with the actor playing that character, seen in street clothes. The actors&apos; names are at the very bottom of the frame, and unfortunately when seen on TV the names are almost completely obscured. This isn&apos;t such a problem when the actor is well remembered, like W.C. Fields or Gary Cooper, but not many latter-day viewers are going to recognize the likes of Ford Sterling or Louise Fazenda. It would be delightful news for movie buffs if someone (Criterion, are you listening?) could release a fully restored, letter-boxed edition of this flawed but fascinating production.\n\nP.S. It&apos;s a pleasure to add that, as of March 2010, this film has finally received an official DVD release, concurrent with the new Tim Burton adaptation of the story. I look forward to renewing my acquaintance with the Paramount Alice.",

Romeo Dallaire (Roy Dupuis) who led a United Nations peacekeeping force. I will admit to being a bit confused initially as to what was going on and why Dallarie wasn&apos;t given any help (in fact support was taken away) or the ability to engage. His hands were completely tied as he dealt with bureaucrats and watched genocide take place around him, very frustrating. As the world stood by, 454 UN Peacekeepers from over 20 nations chose to stay behind in Rwanda, helping to save the lives of 32,000 Rwandans who would otherwise have been murdered.\n\nThis has been based on Dallaire&apos;s autobiography and Roy Dupuis is amazing in this role, transforming himself into the General. The scenes where he is with his therapist back in Canada were interesting, suffering from PTSD as the ghosts of those he knew and served with are in the room with him. Beautiful scenery but horrific and stomach churning that this was allowed to happen. 10/13",

As many of you may know I have never really been a big fan of these epic martial arts type movies. There have been a few I liked but not many. This one may be the best one I have seen since &quot;Hero&quot;. This movie grabs you from the opening scene and is action packed and keeps you interested the entire time. The story and action are very well done and there is not a dull moment in this at all. There are some very brutal scenes in this but it&apos;s not over the top at all and it helps the story. For fans of this genre this is a must see. For those like me who can go either way this is still a movie that is very much worth watching. Overall, one of the best of this genre I have seen.

As usual, Harris and Proctor bumble everywhere and it&apos;s the other guys who catch the bad guys.\n\nThe film could not be considered as strong as Parts 1,2,3 and 5 but it is very very good indeed. Scenes to watch out for include the battle between Hightower and the big strong bad guy, Jones pretending to be a robot and the identity of Mr. Big revealed.\n\nGreat film!"

It is a joy watching these two outstanding thespians at work. It is amazing the intensity and depth they bring to their performances. They bring these tortured characters to life and you feel their pain. When I was getting ready to write this review, my first instinct was to say that there wasn&apos;t a really likable character in the film. That instinct was wrong. Its not that the characters aren&apos;t likable, its just that they are flawed and in deep emotional pain because one man didn&apos;t do his job as a responsible husband and father and the pain he caused lives after his death. This is a very dark film, very depressing, gritty and true to life. No &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; happy endings here folks. Surprisingly, I think it makes it a better movie. The only major beef I have with this film is the character of the boy Josh. He is without a doubt the most appalling child character since Wesley on Mister Belvedere. I kept wanting one of the adults to give him a good smack in his little fresh, dirty mouth. I always hate it in movies when they show smart aleck kids who talk to adults more strongly then real life kids would dare do!"

It is seldom that we see a top quality thriller, but this movie is well cast, well directed, and works wonderfully. The story is quite simple really, it relies on strong characterisation and good dialogue. All the cast give good performances and Thora Birch is outstanding. This thriller really does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout; it is very dark, very creepy and has a terrifying atmosphere. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good thriller. It isn&apos;t in the same league as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs, but it is better than most thrillers that are released. \n\n8/10 A great film.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 1920&apos;s several international characters gather to compete in the gruelling Monte Carlo Rally. Some will employ fair means or foul to ensure victory.\n\nThis film was a follow up of sorts to 1965&apos;s &apos;Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines&apos;, although it also bares similarities to &apos;The Great Race&apos;(in which Tony Curtis once again starred). Sadly it is not in the same class as either. It lacks the coherence, wit and spectacle of &apos;Flying Machines&apos;, despite Ken Annakin being at the helm once more. In fairness to him the main problem is the screenplay - its simply not that funny. This causes an over reliance on the visual gags, and here again the film falls short. The effects aren&apos;t terribly special even for 1969. Some of the characters are also downright irritating - I&apos;m thinking particularly of the Italians - bulging eyed, flailing armed, noisy oafs.\n\nThere are some compensations however. Dear old Terry-Thomas and Eric Sykes repeat their double act from the previous film to some effect, and Susan Hampshire is every inch the English Rose. But its Peter Cook and Dudley Moore who steal the show as a British Army Officer/Inventor and his Batman respectively. They have all the best lines and manage to deliver them in a typically deadpan and upper class manner. Example:- As their car hurtles down a snowy hillside out of control, and having tried every concievable method of stopping it to no avail, Cook calmly announces &quot;This simply won&apos;t do at all!&quot; Priceless.\n\nNot a total disaster then, but considering the talent involved, with better writing and more careful work all round it could have been, and indeed should have been, so much better.",

There is no tension, no frights and very little gore, and that is badly done. I know Ulli Lommel has produced some of worst movies in history but this surpasses even those god awful efforts. Maybe Lommel&apos;s parents are to blame for encouraging him or maybe he&apos;s just some spoilt rich kid with more money than sense but either way, he should stop making films immediately. I believe the movie is taken from a book called &quot;Diary of a Cannibal&quot;. I&apos;m intrigued enough by the awfulness of the film to seek out this book and see if it is better. It must be.The entire movie is made up of flashbacks that are, more often than not, repeated over and over. The whole thing looks like it was shot through the bottom of a jam jar and the main actors do nothing of consequence throughout the whole turgid 80 minutes or so. If somebody offers &quot;Cannibal&quot; to you for free, don&apos;t take it. Just walk away because you will, most surely, regret the experience for the rest of your life.",

      "reviewBody": "Deranged is a recent (2012) horror/thriller/monster movie that&apos;s decent enough. For comparison&apos;s sake to recent similarly themed Korean movies; it&apos;s not near on the level of say The Host, but it&apos;s quite better than incredibly disappointing Sector 7.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nHere&apos;s your story: A severely dehydrated and decomposed body washes up on shore somewhere in Korea. The medical examiners are a bit baffled at the cause of death, but alert the police that this isn&apos;t the first identical case they&apos;ve seen. Soon enough, more dead bodies start arriving by the handful, then dozens, then hundreds, across the whole of Korea. Widespread panic sets in, and it quickly becomes clear that some type of deadly outbreak is underway. \n\nWith few clues at all, the authorities fortunately catch a break when they observe some of deaths occurring in real time on video cameras throughout the country. What they see appears to be people desperately trying to drown themselves as if they were possessed or on drugs. Another break in the case soon appears when one of the bodies is recovered before it can make it to a waterway to drown itself. What&apos;s inside the body are mutated parasitic worms that have latched on to the human nervous system in order to feed &amp; reproduce.\n\nThe worms feed on the host, requiring massive amounts of water to stay hydrated, until they are fully grown. Once in the adult stage, they drive the host to the nearest body of water where they can escape in order to reproduce. Surgery is not an option, but at least the doctors and scientists can now study the parasites and try to find a way to kill them. They better find a solution quick though, because the epidemic is spinning out of control. \n\nThe pacing of the early half of this movie is really nicely done. The outbreak occurs suddenly and without explanation, and the tension is palpable as thousands of people are soon contaminated, and efforts to contain the problem are not working. Before long, infected people are everywhere, and their zombie like insistence to get to water is entertainingly portrayed. This part of the movie certainly gives you a &quot;we&apos;re all screwed&quot; impression that the end of the world is near.\n\nMiraculously, there already exists a solution for the problem, in the form of a rather obscure over the counter drug that was recently discontinued. The general public races out to buy up the remaining supply off the shelves, while the government works to restart production as quickly as possible. The lone pharma company that makes the drug can&apos;t meet demand alone though, and being a dickish pharma company, they don&apos;t want to release the drug&apos;s formula because of the profits at stake. \n\nThe outbreak, the government&apos;s efforts in containing it, and the pharma company&apos;s involvement are all effectively portrayed. There&apos;s also some lingering concerns as to how and why this outbreak started, and why this otherwise unimportant drug is the cure all. It makes for an interesting case study that covers a wide range of the implications of modern medicine &amp; science, corporate power &amp; greed, etc.\n\nWhere this film fails to succeed is on a personal level. While the wider focus is on the overall problem at hand, there&apos;s also a separate focal point involving 2 brothers and their families affected by the epidemic. These personal stories are attempted to be interjected in similar manner as in The Host, to give you a family/personal connection to the overall monster/disaster story, but it&apos;s not very effective. Part of the problem is the actors and actresses don&apos;t seem to mesh together well, and worse, their interpersonal stories are not very well written for them. I simply did not care about the cop and the relationship with his estranged scientist wife because of the cursory nature of it. The other brother&apos;s efforts to save his family are undermined by a similar problem.\n\nThese stories are underwritten and seemed forced into the plot without much foresight. Either they should have devoted more effort developing these characters before and during the events, or they should have dedicated less time to them altogether. As it stood, it came off as a somewhat half-assed attempt to have you invest in some random characters as they reconnect with one another while under duress. Did not work!\n\nOverall, this film&apos;s not bad for what it is. It works OK enough to slightly recommend, and it does so on a moderate budget for a horror/monster film.\n\nBottom Line: 6 or 7 stars or so. 6 stars it is.",

His brother Jae-pil is a detective that is not all that interested in public safety and spends most of his time moaning about the stock market. The discovery of a series of floating, gruesomely skeletal bodies around the country sparks hysteria.

Meanwhile, Jae-hyukÂ’s wife and children are showing the same symptoms as the victims, leading to a frantic search for medicine. Through Jae-pil he learns of a warehouse containing a potential cure in thousands and thousands of doses and heads there with no idea of what heÂ’s heading into.",

      "reviewBody": "The main value of this enchanting film is the glimpse it gives us of Balinese village life and culture of 100 years ago. The film is well photographed and the Technicolor process in use then was more than adequate to the task of bringing out all the rich details.\n\nSeveral reviewers have lamented about this &quot;lost&quot; culture, even suggesting that Hollywood and film audiences have played a part in its destruction. WRONG! The Balinese culture remains relatively intact today! This is due to the genius of the people in using modern technological when necessary and convenient without destroying the essence and magic of their vibrant cultural heritage. \n\nSo the great appeal of this film will be to those who visit Bali today and wish to compare their experience with these pictures of the past. There are some differences, of course. Most Balinese males now wear western attire and jeans &quot;during the day&quot; and may revert to more traditional sarong garb in the privacy of their homes &quot;after work.&quot; \n\nAll the young ladies cover their breasts today, but this trend was already underway in the thirties when the film was shot. (However, one can still find in the villages very old ladies who disdain covering their upper bodies.) In the film all of the females are shown bare-breasted some but not all of the time. And they are beauties! (And one suspects the raison d&apos;etre for the creation of the film may have been to exploit such pulchritude!) \n\nSo the pictures of village life in the film are accurate, and can be experienced today if one leaves the tourist areas and seeks out the rural hinterlands. The dances shown in the film are still performed on a regular basis (for a tourist audience, to be sure) but unchanged in content. Cock-fighting remains a very popular pastime. The religious rites and processions and cremation ceremonies have not changed at all. They are all well depicted in the film.\n\nHowever, the writer of the screen play was obviously not a Balinese and his plot contrivances concerning romance and courtship are more European than Balinese. It is, for instance, almost unthinkable that a Balinese girl would kill herself over a failed &quot;love affair&quot; consisting mainly of a few amorous glances and a brief conversation or two! She would simply move on and pick another lover. \n\nThe writer also gets the religious thinking behind cremation all wrong. A Balinese MUST be properly cremated if the soul is to attain Nirvana, their equivalent of &quot;heaven.&quot; An opposite view is posited in the film.\n\nIf you have no interest in Bali, forget this film. Otherwise, I think you will enjoy the experience.",

This production style has ten individuals or pairings of clinic patients interact as a group, and we are invited to watch the story unfold in an asynchronous presentation. The group have an unrealistic conception success rate and a medical review takes the viewers back and forth through several months of these peoples lives.\n\nI found myself often confused where I was in the story and every time the setting changes, the experiences of all ten are displayed. I&apos;m looking for the differences for the differences of feelings or responses from the ten, but mostly wondered why does the movie want me to watch all ten going through basically the same motions. This repetition maybe the only reason the movie is compelling at all.\n\nUltimately the movie feels like it&apos;s 20 minutes too long. The Las Vegas setting feels like a silly place for a fertility clinic unless the satire of the story is trying to make concept of taking a gamble more conspicuous. There is little which is believable about the story, and maybe that was an intention point -- we should be cautious about any technologies involving life and death choices.\n\nWhile I can&apos;t really recommend anyone search out this title, it was a satisfying distraction for an afternoon.",

Kessler). This problematic history explains why this is such a poor picture. Even the photography with its day-for-night shots is disappointing. Wayde Preston uses ridiculous false beards, I wonder why anyone takes his various disguises seriously. However, De Santis is an impressive, hateful villain and the movie manages at least a few nice tricks along the way which you haven&apos;t seen in other westerns.",

      "reviewBody": "Ernst Lubitsch was a great director who very rarely made a dud. While One Hour With You may not be as good as The Merry Widow, Heaven Can Wait and The Shop Around the Corner it is still well worth watching and is a very good film overall. The film does drag a little towards the end and the ending is rather abrupt and awkwardly staged. But One Hour With You also has many pleasures, a case of the pros far outweighing the cons. One Hour With You is stylishly photographed with elegant period detail, and Lubitsch directs with his usual classiness. The songs are just great and generally do deserve to be much better known, the title song is the most well-known one and it is a catchy one indeed but we mustn&apos;t forget the risqué(for the time) Oh Mitzi, the witty Three Times a Day or the charming We Will Always Be Sweethearts. The dialogue is funny and sophisticated, the rhyming was really inspired and Maurice Chavalier&apos;s talking to the camera could have been annoying but was far from it. The story is very fluffy but very light-hearted, warm-hearted and sweet and nowhere near as improbable as the story for Monte Carlo(a better film than it&apos;s given credit for but the weakest Lubitsch I&apos;ve seen so far). One Hour With You is beautifully acted especially from the sassy and beguiling Genevieve Tobin. Maurice Chevalier oozes wit and easy-going charm and avoids being creepy in Oh Mitzi despite the risqué/suggestive material. Jeanette MacDonald radiates on screen and sings beautifully in We Will Always Be Sweethearts(sad that she didn&apos;t sing more) and Roland Young is deliciously ironic and induces fireworks whenever he appears. All in all, a very good film if not among the best from Lubitsch. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "The story of the doctor Dr. Friedrich Struensee, who came from the city of Altona, which was committed to the Enlightenment, to the royal court in Copenhagen and tried to change the monarchy through Enlightenment reform efforts, is still popularly told. In 1999, the Swedish writer Per Olov ENQUIST, who was long considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, published the novel DER BESUCH DES LEIBARZTES / THE VISIT OF THE PERSONAL DOCTOR. And in 2012, EUROPEAN FILM AWARD winner Mads MIKKELSEN and ACADEMY AWARD winner Alicia VIKANDER presented the Danish film DIE KÖNIGIN UND DER LEIBARZT / THE QUEEN AND THE PERSON in the BERLINALE competition.\n\nThe West German feature film by Harald BRAUN (SOLANGE DU DA BIST / AS LONG AS YOU ARE THERE (1953) and REGINE (1956)) was made in 1957 and was based on the original THE QUEEN&apos;S FAVORITE by Robert NEUMANN.\n\nAnd you can already tell that the love story between Struensee (O. W. FISCHER) and the Danish Queen Mathilde (Odile VERSOIS, a sister of Marina VLADY) is at the center of the action. The political intrigues of Queen Mother Juliane (Elisabeth FLICKENSCHILDT) and the chamberlains (Siegfried LOWITZ, Helmuth LOHNER) are treated rather marginally. The best role goes to the two-time GERMAN FILM AWARD winner Horst BUCHHOLZ (in 1956 he won the award for HIMMEL OHNE STERNE / HEAVEN WITHOUT STARS and in 1985 for WENN ICH MICH FÜRCHTE / WHEN I&apos;M FEAR) as the confused King Christian VII, who is accompanying his colleagues FISCHER (who also won the GERMAN FILM AWARD) ( (awarded in 1955 for LUDWIG II and in 1959 for HELDEN) and FLICKENSCHILDT (awarded in 1964 for DAS GROSSE LIEBESSPIEL) easily plays on the wall. The future CINECITTA diva Ingeborg SCHÖNER can be seen as the queen&apos;s lovely chambermaid, who gained new popularity in the 1980s through the crime series SOKO 5113, which ran on the West German television station ZDF.\n\nThe film is beautifully photographed. It&apos;s only occasionally annoying that you can sense the scenery of the BAVARIA studios. The outdoor shots were taken in Copenhagen and on the North Sea island of Sylt. Wilhelmsthal Castle and the Löwenburg in Kassel served as castles. The film attracted 3.9 million visitors (source: InsideKino) to West German cinemas and achieved an estimated box office gross of EURO 2.535 million.",

Together they explore, discover, and learn from each other. To do that of course they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humour, all of which they both have. I wish this film was realistic, I wish this type of story happened more often, I wish we didn&apos;t have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds. The film&apos;s message is based in the open heart, and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there - a world where peace could be a possibility.",

      "reviewBody": "The discovery of a skull and a sheriff&apos;s badge on a disused military firing range prompts Sheriff Sam Deeds to investigate.  Sam has long lived in the shadow of his father Buddy, himself the sheriff at one time.  However clues point to the fact that the skull may belong to Charley Wade, the corrupt sheriff who `vanished&apos; to Mexico when Deeds challenged him many years prior. However when Sam begins to ask questions that go deeper than the legends, he finds secrets within the border town that hit very near home.\n\nHaving just watched The Hi Lo Country (a modern day western with a sprawling story but focused on one thing), I was put in mind to watch Lone Star again. Lone Star is easily the superior film and is a rich weaving of many characters and stories all around one event.  The one event is the uncovering of an old murder (possibly) and this central investigation holds the attention easily.  Within this investigation and the lives that Buddy affected we are shown a lot of subplots  some followed through, others just giving us enough background to understand the characters.  All of these work very well and as a result you don&apos;t feel like the film is wandering when it moves away from the investigation by Sam.  The subplots are so well translated that we are given a lot of back story to complex characters in a very short time.\n\nFor the script to be able to create so many characters that feel real and that have meaningful things going on is impressive.  That it makes them all work is amazing and is due to Sayles both writing and editing.  As director he is great as well, avoiding the washed out desert feel many `Mexico related&apos; films have and instead goes for richer colours that reflect the rich mix of communities that are in his story.\n\nThe acting is faultless all round.  No one actor stands out regardless of screen time simply because no one goes over the top and everyone realises they are playing part of a story  even Cooper (realistically the nearest thing to a lead actor) plays it down rather than taking the film over. Morton is good even if his character is the least connected to the investigation, McConaughey is strong despite being little more than a cameo, likewise with Kristofferson.  McDormand has a small role but is very impressive as Deeds&apos; ex-wife.  Elizabeth Peña, so often dumped with almost token Espanic roles is given a real good part and works with it well.  I could list them all, however if any one person stands out it can only be Sayles himself  he takes all the strands and brings them together.  I watched a 90 minutes comedy earlier the same day that had dragged.  At 130 minutes this simply flew  it is that engrossing.\n\nOverall some will find it too slow, too character driven, sadly some will just not sit through a good story if that&apos;s all there is to it (all!).  I think this was reflected in poor box office at the time (comparatively poor anyway).  But those who have seen it will generally love it  if only more people would watch it!  A final word on the film  the ending is shocking and sensationalist on paper and a lesser man would have made a big deal out of it.  Sayles simply ends the film softly and leaves us the audience to take what we will from it.  Low key from start to finish  I can&apos;t praise it enough."

I mean every word. The decor is priceless and the timing of editing! no wonder since Anker Sørensen the director is also a master editor! And consider the fact that this movie premiered in Denmark in 1961, I repeat 1961!! Under the skin of everything in this movie lies the cold war, there is a very understated seriousness to this movie. One could discuss it is a very naive and lighthearted approach to that problem? But that aside still a great movie of its time! even ahead of its time in many aspects. Typical danish fun to watch, sweet to the tooth kind of deal.Worth your time!",

      "reviewBody": "Most reviews seem to look at this through the prism of &quot;Deadwood,&quot; which seems unfair as the elongated TV format allows for far more character development. So to point out that the characters in &quot;Wild Bill&quot; aren&apos;t as-- well, you get the picture. Viewed alone, the movie deserves praise for performance, set design, a sense of period dialogue and historical accuracy in visual recreations. Yes, WB really did wear Navy Colts backwards, cavalry-style, in a red sash; yes, he did have greasy lanks of hair and wear a big floppy hat, a thick tie and a vest that didn&apos;t match his jacket which didn&apos;t match his pants. And for about an hour, I think the movie is pretty amusing. But when it sinks into Deadwood over its last hour, it appears to use too much of the stagey dialogue of one of its sources, a play by someone named Thomas Babe. At this point, it pretty much abandons history which is bad enough, but also cinematic fluency, of which Hill is a master: it becomes static, talky, dreary, and completely loses its momentum. And someone--Babe?--made the decision to give the McCall-Hickcock dynamic an Oedipal overtone--he&apos;s the &quot;son&quot; of a woman once loved , then abandoned, by Hickcock. This is an attempt at coherency, to bring the murder into some sort of classic framework. Yeah, swell, however: McCall was much older, a buffalo hunter who&apos;d lost dough to Wild Bill the night before. He didn&apos;t stand for the abused son, he stood for the randomness of frontier violence, where booze, pride, stupidity and a culture of pointless aggression could easily spell an ambush murder like McCall&apos;s. THAT, to me, would not only have been more accurate, but more fluent and a better movie.",

His wife (Helen Mirren in an Oscar-nominated role) cannot cope and it turns out that no one can really help the king as the medical profession just lacked the modernism necessary to assist. Ian Holm is a genuine scene-stealer as the physician who uses some unorthodox methods to try and cure the titled character. Nigel Hawthorne, who sadly passed away recently, was one of the truly great actors of his time and this was his finest role. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "Upon seeing the Poster on the left for the first time, I was vilely repulsed. My God! It looks like a recruitment poster for an SS Death Squad! Whose idea of a sick joke was this, anyway? But the image kept ricocheting around in my brain non-stop.\n\nHmmm...1951, after the war. It&apos;s got to be ANTI-Nazi, for sure, I thought. Many of us spend time searching for &quot;hidden gems&quot;. &quot;The Axe of Wandsbek&quot; is, unequivocally, my best find to date, bar none! It is a truly misunderstood masterpiece, of great cinematic, social and historic import.\n\nDirector Falk Harnak was a member of the German resistance during the war, as was his brother and most of his extended family. Harnak&apos;s brother and most of his relatives were German Gentiles who died in Nazi death camps. Harnak himself narrowly escaped death at Dachau. After the war, the (&quot;We Love Freedom&quot;) Americans REFUSED to grant him permission to make this film. He was forced to ask the Russians, in control of East Germany, and they gave him the green light. AXE played to packed houses in the East until the Russians, after 3 weeks, pulled the plug on its continued presentation and kept it out of East German release for over 30 years! (They had their own agenda, of course, and claimed AXE painted an unrealistically sympathetic portrait of the Nazis!)\n\nHarnak&apos;s film speaks a truth that has been yearning to be told for decades! &quot;For ye shall know the TRUTH...and the TRUTH shall set you FREE!&quot; Before viewing, it is indispensable that you watch University of Massachusetts Historian Dr. Allen&apos;s explanation of the great social and historical significance of AXE. At 30 minutes it&apos;s a bit long, but worth it! Dr. Allen adds that in 1951 Germans seemed anathema to any forum in search of collective catharsis. All background info mentioned here comes from her interview. BTW, AXE is exquisitely made! 10*********, but recommended only for History, Sociolgy, Poly-Sci or classic foreign cinema enthusiasts!\n\nENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!",

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie quite a lot; if you are into Jeunet-type fantasy, I would recommend that you see it. Overall, I would give it a rating of 7 out of 10. The reason for the Jeunet comparison (e.g. Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) is that it has the same dark antiutopian/surrealistic ambiance to it, and is very imaginative. It is also very elaborate in its style, which lends most of the appeal to the movie. This being said, the biggest disappointment of the movie is the plot, which is overly straightforward and simple-minded, but at least it does not devolve into some technical meaningless psycho-babble as many Hollywood fantasy movies do, and maintains its fairy-tale quality.\n\nIt is unfortunate that modern Russian cinematography seems to be chasing the success of Hollywood (which is ironic, given the country&apos;s negative attitude towards US in general and Hollywood in particular), but this movie benefits from Hollywood-style special effects, and is free of annoying clichés (unlike the atrociously pretentious &quot;Barber of Siberia&quot; - another recent style-heavy Russian blockbuster; sorry Mikhalkov).\n\nTo sum up, this movie is quite original, imaginative, stylish and at times visually stunning, which in my book constitutes success, but don&apos;t expect any depth of ideas."

Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed out loud ooh at least five times and I&apos;m not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too. The cast, acting and script is great, I watch a lot of films right across the board and I haven&apos;t seen one in this genre that has been as successful. Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some! I&apos;m sure the book is good too but I think you have to judge it on its own merits.",

Using old tricks of mistaken identity and falling in love with a stranger, the dialogue is somehow saved from sounding corny and instead pays homage to the classic romantic comedies.

It really is quite good.  The story centers on a disfunctional family in a large Irish castle that had tragedy befall them six years ago when the youngest daughter died by drowning,  Since then the father has died and the mother has become obsessed with the death of her only daughter Kathleen, and she has her sons and herself attend a mock funeral every year as a kind of memorial.  Thrown into the picture are a fortune-hunting daughter-in-law and a strange, cryptic doctor(wonderfully played by the very underrated Patrick Magee).  The film has some great scenes and is very high on atmosphere. Despite being made on a shoestring budget(although actually filmed in Ireland and around a real Irish castle), the film transcends its limited resources and becomes a series of atmospheric shocks.  The death scenes are well-directed, particularly the two involving Luana Anders.  The score by Corman regular Ronald Stein is also first-rate.  A great film to watch late at night."

I said this cause I thought that the script was great and original, really different and refreshing.  Now I wouldn&apos;t say that it&apos;s the greatest film that I&apos;ve seeing cause of the acting.  The actors that played each role, seems that they played them without emotions, as if they took the life out of them.  When the wife laughed or cried, this didn&apos;t look real to me for some reason, that&apos;s just an example, but sincerely all the characters didn&apos;t act real at all.  I wish I could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it at least once but how can I do that since I know that I&apos;m not going to see this movie again.  I rented this film from the library of my school, without hearing anything about the film itself or the director.  I took a chance because the story that was describe on the back sounded really interesting and it really was.",

Grierson was a major player in documentary film-making and his influence is still felt today.\n\nNonetheless, this movie is still terrible to watch and will only be watched by many (I assume) because of its historical significance.

      "reviewBody": "I saw the Iron Sky recently in a preview screening. And, I quite liked it.\n\nFor those that do not know, Iron Sky is a Sci-fi action comedy from a team of Finnish &quot;independent&quot; film makers lead by Timo Vuorensola as the director. Iron Sky tells a story about &apos;freaking space Nazis from the dark side of the moon coming back to earth&apos;.\n\nFor what it is, the movie works fine. It&apos;s not a masterpiece of dramatic cinematic flavor on line with Citizen Kane or Pianist with some deep philosophical dialog. No, its more in the line of campy Nazisploitation and over-the top action, as one would come to expect. And as one would expect, the movie is absolutely ridiculous. It has its many fun moments and true laugh out loud scenes, specially made for those viewers who are into internet/computer/pop culture related stuff, which presence makes sense considering the guys who made this film are &quot;self taught&quot; young film makers who basically &apos;grew up&apos; making movies of their own, and are the children of the Internets.\n\nIron Sky has a really good cast who deliver consistently strong performance throughout the film. With Udo Kier being my absolute favorite who sadly goes somewhat underused with his too old to care and strictly for business Nazi führer of the moon guy... (Oh well, I still have him as the Yuri in Red Alert 2.) Weirdly, Götz Otto being the go-to baddie of the movie, delivers somewhat dry and unnoteworthy performance. And I think it felt this way was because there was a subtlety in his acting which sadly vanishes under rest of the silliness in the film.\n\nNow as expected from the guys who previously did the Star Wrek comedy films, they made absolutely brilliant CGI effects for Iron Sky. I rarely could tell which stuff were done with practical effects and which were done with CGI, which is a very good thing. There are many moments which I knew were definitely done with computers, but still were a blast to watch. Nothing there is jarring or unnecessary feeling, like in majority of the other CGI motion pictures of today.\n\nNow there are some few shortcomings in the film of course, few minor stuff here and there, but also one bigger aspect that was quite difficult to overlook. And that is that the Iron Sky skips around, a lot. It felt like there were tons of shots missing from between the key scenes. You&apos;ll watch the characters do something and have it immediately cut to a later moment in time, or to a completely different scene all together. The movie leaves a lot for the viewers to fill in. That was not too difficult for me one I adjusted. It&apos;s a bit distracting, yes. But if you manage to push it past, you&apos;ll find interesting plot unfolding. Now while I had no difficulties following the movie, I can also see someone used to the regular Hollywood &quot;tell it to the audience&quot; type movies being lost with this film. While the important scenes needed for the plot are still very much present, the sudden jumps might leave the viewer lagging behind, you might get some whiplashes watching this film.\n\nHowever, there is a very understandable excuse for that, which the director himself told us in the theater on the Q&amp;A session after the film. And it&apos;s that way because they had to cut stuff from the script as they simply had no money to realistically do most of them. Iron Sky had a budget of only of 7 million Euros, which compared to other proper big movies, is nothing. They said that every scene they did had to be done in the way of &quot;we&apos;ll shoot this if we get the money to do it&quot;. And considering that, it&apos;s amazing they managed as much as they did.\n\nIron Sky is a fun little movie that definitely differs from your average schlock. I&apos;d recommend to watch it, if only for the sake of curiosity. (And ridiculous Nazis.)\n\nAnd what about the the ending? Who wins? Oh, you&apos;ll have to watch the movie to find out. You might get a surprise. It might make you stop and think... I know it made me.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Well it&apos;s finally here, after a long wait we get to see a tamil movie. Ratchakan!&quot; - so much has been said about this film in 1997\n\nIt&apos;s said to be the most expensive tamil movie so far. It&apos;s also said that it has a different story from any other Indian movie; Looking at the title one may think that Ratchakan is something like a younger-character version of Indian or a movie with a patriotic theme; but it is NOTHING like that. It&apos;s just another stylised love action story with some glamorous conventions of the late 90s meant to appeal to couples in their 20s or 30s in those times.\n\nThe story goes something like this... Ajay(Nagarjun) an unemployed youth always gets into trouble because of his temper. He gets heated up when he sees anyone committing a crime; he takes the law in his own hands... beats them up and then gives them some free advice. Ajay&apos;s father, played by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, is very unhappy at his son&apos;s attitude, and tries his level best to change Ajay but he fails in this matter. Ajay meets Soniya(Susmitha Sen) and she falls for him instantly. What Soniya likes about Ajay is his temper. Soniya gets Ajay&apos;s father S.P.B&apos;s help to get Ajay to love her. Ajay is not interested in her at first; but later changes his mind and falls in love with her.\n\nSoniya&apos;s father Sriram(Girish Karnad) a businessman, has no objection to his daughter&apos;s relationship... But has one condition; which is , Ajay must control his temper for 90 days and not get into any fight what so ever, even though he sees a crime happening in front of his eyes. If Ajay doesn&apos;t succeed he can&apos;t marry Soniya. With a heavy heart Ajay agrees to the condition, and Sriram offers Ajay a job in his factory. Sriram actually has his own problems in his factory; 10 of his workers are working with his rival Easwar(Raghuvaran). Easwar is trying to put Sriram out of business and so his 10 people create havoc in the factory by killing old workers and &quot;ragging&quot; new workers. So when Ajay comes to work in Sriram&apos;s factory these 10 people do the same to Ajay. Ajay keeps cool, trying to keep his promise to Sriram. But Sriram hopes otherwise; he WANTS Ajay to break the promise and beat up the 10 people and throw them out of the factory; At the same time, Sriram hopes that the imminent marriage between Ajay and Soniya would get cancelled, since he doesn&apos;t want his daughter to be married to a &quot;gangster/street fighter&quot; like Ajay. So Sriram keeps on hoping that Ajay will somehow &quot;burst out&quot; so that his plans will succeed.\n\nWill Ajay break the Condition? Will Sriram&apos;s plan succeed? Will Easwar&apos;s plan succeed? Watch the movie and find out for yourself! Overall an average movie; but here are the credits: A.R. Rahman music is the BEST ever (9 songs altogether), \n\nThe music picturization of the songs are Excellent. There are some good &amp; dramatic action scenes; one in particular, is the scene is where Soniya has to drive a 20-wheel oil tanker (ordered by Easwar to do so) and if the tanker&apos;s speed goes below a certain speed limit the tanker will explode into flames. (elements of Hollywood movie SPEED). However poor execution marred the potential of the action elements in the movie . \n\nNagarjun seems too old for action movies and spends time running around &amp; dancing with a very young Susmitha Sen. Susmitha&apos;s acting in not convincing but does her glamour job very well . So if you like action movies and don&apos;t bother about the story or the actors; then this movie is for you. As my last words this is a Romance- Action movie; since there are no other tamil movies showing now this movie will be a great pass time and especially the music by AR Rahman is one for the finest in his career.",

      "reviewBody": "Despite the catch-penny title and stupid &quot;warning&quot; to viewers, this is a well-crafted thriller. In fact, it&apos;s a mix of thriller and horror as we can&apos;t be sure of what&apos;s behind the infernally sneaky skull. Seems poor troubled Jenni accompanies new husband Eric to his dead first wife&apos;s empty mansion. It&apos;s empty except for loony gardener Eric, who bumbles around like a gimpy zombie. Now strange sounds and happenings that surround a mysterious skull start haunting Jenni. Is it her troubled past and imagination, or maybe the loony gardener devoted to Eric&apos;s first wife, or maybe even a truly evil spirit. Old movie fans may notice echoes here of 1940&apos;s classic Hitchcock, &quot;Rebecca&quot;. \n\nThe horror aspect as a whole is downplayed in favor of actress Webber&apos;s truly impressive performance as Jenni. In fact, she runs a gamut of emotions in convincing fashion without the self-mockery of many horror flicks. In fact, I&apos;d give her a hooded Oscar for carrying the tricky narrative in compelling style. For guys, her traipsing around in a see-through gown also works. Outstanding too are camera-man Crosby whose b&amp;w shadings are A-picture atmospheric, along with director Nicol who manages to blend the somewhat awkward parts pretty effectively.\n\nI wish IMDB were able to post the movie&apos;s budget, with a cast of five and just a few sets, it couldn&apos;t be much. But they got their money&apos;s worth and so will viewers if you can get past the title and stupid warning."

The marvelously far-fetched plot grabs the audience till the very end as the two stories meet.Brannagh and Thompson succeeded in creating two characters each .The director cleverly uses in turn color (present) and black and white (past).The finale in the flat where the amnesic girl keeps her surrealist works (a la Dali,like in &quot;spellbound&quot; ) is grand guignol at its best.That&apos;s entertainment!",

It&apos;s hard to tell what the film would&apos;ve been like had Romm enough time to finish it, but Elem Klimov and Marlen Khutsiev were obviously not able to find an apt form for remaining footage. Intertitles that they chose to resort to give the effect very different from Romm&apos;s narration. The rendering of material in the second part of the film is not only predictably biased and one-sided, which by itself is not a crime, but too often, instead of giving a subjective view, leans towards plain and boring propaganda.\n\nWhat is truly valuable is the footage in the second part of the film that shows people of the early 1970s from all over Europe: interviews with children and young people, a rock concert, people in the streets - walking, kissing, reading... Sketches for a portrait of the age."

      "reviewBody": "This film takes place in Mexico during the last year of French rule with forces loyal to Napoleon III trying to stop arms shipments from Texas to Benito Juarez. As is often the case during a time of strife there is increased social unrest and as a result law and order has completely broken down with revolutionaries, arms smugglers and gamblers taking advantage of the situation. To that end, a French officer by the name of &quot;Lieutenant Jean Martin&quot; (Gaspare Zola) is instructed to stop a shipment of guns on its way to the local revolutionary commander &quot;General Droga&quot; (Walter Barnes). The problem with that is the fact that Lt. Martin has proven to be totally incapable of carrying out these orders as he has demonstrated several times in the past. But with no other option he complies with his instructions-and gets taken prisoner yet again. Fortunately, with the help of a double agent by the name of &quot;Carlos&quot; (Yorgo Voyagis) he manages to escape into the desert landscape and flags down a stagecoach headed in his direction. It&apos;s there that he meets a beautiful female gambler named &quot;Lulu &apos;Garter&apos; Colt&quot; (Nicoletta Machiavelli) and from that point on their lives-along with that of Carlos-will become extremely complicated. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had some potential but the talents of these actors were terribly wasted by an incoherent plot, poor direction and an awful script. Quite frankly, for a comedy it just wasn&apos;t that funny. Admittedly, having attractive actresses like Silvana Bacci (&quot;as Red&apos;s masseuse&quot;), Marisa Solinas (&quot;Rosie&quot;) and the aforementioned Nicoletta Machiavelli certainly didn&apos;t hurt-but it simply wasn&apos;t enough to overcome the faults just mentioned and I have rated this movie accordingly.",

The climbing sequences had a few minor errors, but all considered, the most accurate movie adaptation of climbing with the possible exception of &quot;Storm and Sorrow&quot;. I felt like I was there with the climbers, cold and scared and forced to continue. The dialogue on the mountain is &quot;rock&quot; solid.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a well-developed action flick with a dash of spy stuff, watch this movie. Eastwood has done so many great movies that it&apos;s hard to rank this one- it&apos;s not his best, but it is wonderful.",

This movie, on the other hand, may be trying to capture that &quot;old-fashioned&quot; feeling, but the values it&apos;s after are the values of craftsmanship and intelligence, two things rarely seen in comedies these days.  Oh, yes, and chemistry; Clooney and Pfeiffer have it in spades here.  The fact that it&apos;s set among the world of working parents and, for the most part, tries to get the details right, also helps.  And, oh yeah, it&apos;s funny.  It is a little cloying at times, and the end feels abrupt, but overall this is a pleasing movie.",

The rest of this ensemble cast which included the stepsisters (Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins) Tami (Jessica Parker) Dustin (Marcus Paulk) and Natalia (Nicole La Placa) all injected their characters with a bid of an edge. This movie was aimed at the 9-13 age range and hit it&apos;s target. Was it predictable, yes but the cast was brilliant and brought an old tale into today&apos;s world. The characters were lovable,except the obvious Britt Bree and Natalia, who balanced the fairytale with their nasty attitudes and antics. I loved the dance theme and the dancing was amazing. It won&apos;t win an academy award, but that was not it&apos;s goal. The goal was entertainment pure and simple.",

      "reviewBody": "An elderly scientist has discovered that a new planet has somehow changed its orbital path and will soon come dangerously close to the Earth. An American reporter goes to the northern most reaches of Scotland to meet with this professor in hopes that he can tell the world of his findings. Upon arrival he meets the young, beautiful daughter that he knew previously as a gawky child and a Dr. Mears, a scientist that should have been jailed for some past crimes but somehow was not convicted and was staying at the Professor&apos;s castle because of their former relationship as teacher and pupil. It is with this exposition that famed B director Edgar G. Ulmer then sends an alien in a small, weird-looking spaceship to this area for the purpose of scouting out another place for his/its own kind. Well, the story takes some interesting, some obvious steps in terms of fleshing out the story, but when the end result is viewed - one should be impressed with several things. First of all, the budget for this film was incredibly small. Ulmer rented out the old sets from Joan of Arc and then transformed them into the castle and Scottish bogs. They are convincing thanks to his heavy use of fog machines. The fog swirls and floats throughout. His special effects are not that bad either for the budget. The alien created looks surprisingly eerie in the fog as it looks through its glass helmet with those glazed, cold, blank eyes. But Ulmer does more than just create an alien that terrifies a region. Ulmer gives the alien a bit of soul. He ends up being a menace, but a question arises that would he have been that same menace if an evil human being had not been involved in trying to communicate with him. Ulmer leaves the answer to you - and it is a stylish, almost profound thing to do in a film like this. Make no mistake, The Man from Planet X is a B picture all the way, but it is a quality B picture with solid, innovative direction, haunting images, good acting from Robert Clarke as the lead, Margaret Field(Sally Field&apos;s mom) as the love-interest/daughter, and good-old William Schallert as the conniving Dr. Mears. My favourite performance though is by Roy Engel as a Scottish policeman. He can chew up some scenery!",

      "reviewBody": "Coming close to completing my collection of all the Shinya Tsukamoto movies, and this one is pretty hard to explain. A man wakes up in somekind of a concrete space, hardly able to move, and notices he has an injury which is bleeding. It&apos;s very dark, and you only see his face for quite a while and hear him think to himself about what is going on. He begins to crawl through tunnels, or maybe a maze, and comes across a woman also trapped and bleeding. Different visions occurs, like a force knocking on a huge door which he can&apos;t seem to reach, and multilated bodies floating on the surface of a source of water in this space. They begin a conversation about life, dreams, death, and what is happening to each other, and how to escape. He wonders if the world is at war and they are prisoners, or some pervert has locked them away for whatever reason, or is it really a very nasty nightmare or are they in hell. That&apos;s pretty much what is going on, at least for what you can see, because the movie is pretty dark until the last 10 minutes or so. Although the movie is only around 49 minutes long, that is plenty long enough for this type of ambiguous narrative. Being a huge fan of Tsukamoto, this movie to me is like a terrible nightmare, and that may be what it is, you have to judge that because the movie doesn&apos;t help you along much at all. But what there is that is so Tsukamoto, is the superior use of music and sound effects, along with some disturbing visuals. Interesting movie to say the least, and a must-have of course for Tsukamoto fans.",

      "reviewBody": "After reading different comments about this movie, I&apos;ve decided to see it, and I&apos;m really surprised because what I have found has little to do with what I thought it was. \n\nNaqoyqatsi is about the loss of our natural perception of reality and its substitute: the image itself as a product of technology, the image as a weapon in a globalized war. And here comes the apparent incoherence, because the film is a parade of these images, a product of the same technological violence it is reflecting and criticizing. That&apos;s not hypocrisy; the contradiction is part of the film itself.\n\nAlthough I do not completely support Reggio&apos;s point of view, I admire the way he expresses it through his films without impositions of any kind, so that the viewer can find his own perspective. While watching Naqoyqatsi, I was asking for the &quot;original&quot; pictures that were below those distortions and filters, but soon I realized the real world wasn&apos;t there. It was like &quot;OK, so that&apos;s all... Well, let&apos;s see it&quot;.\n\nA few words about the inevitable comparison with it&apos;s predecessors: if you are looking for something like Koyaanisqatsi, go see Koyaanisqatsi again. Naqoyqatsi is a different film. It does well as the third part of the Qatsi Trilogy, but like the other two, has its own &quot;personality&quot;. And I think it&apos;s a great film. Maybe not a masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi, but a great film.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a tremendous World War II film with amazing performances.  The director, Lewis Seiler, and the writer of the screenplay, Lamar Trotti, must have really been on their toes to come up with this little gem from a book by Richard Tregaskis.  The quality of &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; is amazing from the special effects and location shots to the cinematography and the dialogue. Sometimes less is more and this movie demonstrates that in portraying the violence of war realistically without being extremely graphic.  The only minor flaw I saw in the special effects was when a few soldiers were killed by grenades or bombs and they seemed to fall over from the blast a tad bit too quickly.  This movie uses an ensemble cast of actors to tell the story of a platoon of U.S. marines sent to Guadalcanal to fight the Japanese in the South Pacific Ocean.  The focus is not as much on the fighting and battles as it is on the men themselves in the context of war, although there are several terrific scenes of fighting and skirmishes that propel the movie along at an excellent pace. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; is in glorious black and white film and is crisp and clear.  Many scenes from the movie are so vivid that they have lingered in my mind long after watching the movie.  I can recall vividly the palm trees on the beach, the sound of the men singing, the men lounging on the deck of the ship, Japanese soldiers being blown up in a cave and falling out of trees, the faces and expressions of the men and on and on.  This movie not only stood up to a second viewing but also seemed even better the second time around.  I can&apos;t praise the actors enough who breathe life into this movie and who make their characters so easy to get to know that this sixty year old movie seems like it was made yesterday.  Watch this movie and see how these men respond to battle in &quot;Guadalcanal.&quot;  It&apos;s an experience not to be missed.  I highly recommend it and give it a 92/100.  I purchased the DVD for my collection.",

      "reviewBody": "Not having seen this movie for over twenty years, and stumbling across a video of it recently I said &quot;why not?&quot; The stars of this movie provided outstanding acting. Joe Regalbuto as the FBI agent in London of 1939 was a bit wooden in the part. However, I try not to blame actors as they may have been directed to act the way they do. Also, the part called for a naive and inexperienced federal agent. The thing that occurred to me is why would the US Government send an inexperienced agent all the way to London for such an important job, and no senior partner to guide him? He wasn&apos;t a bad actor it was bad writing, he just didn&apos;t seem to be into the part. Other than that, the top actors and actresses did a fine job. Tom Sellick brought his usual suave good looks and easy manner to the part of the professional jewel thief. The local London police official (Bob Hoskins - later of Roger Rabbit and other fame) hated the thief. I don&apos;t think it was ever explained why he had such a virulent hatred. One thing is for sure though, he was very believable and made a name for himself. Lauren Hutton was the twisted Nazi female, so scary that I tipped my hat to Selleck during the movie for even getting close to her. But he had his job to do and never lost his confidence. Hutton played the part to the hilt. Her watch dog was played by Nazi Gestapo badman Warren Clarke and brother was he tough. Excellent job Mr. Clarke. Ed Lauter played Lassiter&apos;s friend the car thief and the man who taxied him around town. I&apos;ve seen him many times and he is always a steady addition to any cast. In the top parts that brings us to Jane Seymour. She has played so many wonderful parts it is difficult to say which was best. But this much is true - she may very well be one of the most beautiful woman of our time. I mean truly beautiful. Sure, she had a nude scene in this movie and what a lovely bottom. However, I&apos;m talking about her face with delicate features that slender down to the chin past sensual eyes, nose and lips. Not quite perfect, yet nearly so, and all coming together into a delicate oval shape. Nevertheless, she has handled demanding roles like Dr. Quinn, the first Battlestar Galactica movie and Somewhere In Time to mention just a few. In this movie, she was Selleck&apos;s lover and a local dancer. She took a part that might have been on the minor side for other actresses, and turned it into a vehicle that increased her value. Lassiter has so many neat things that might be missed like the period costumes, antique automobiles, motorcycle, dinning car in a train, casino interior, Nazi guns and guards, a high wire escape (probably by a stunt man), and kudos to the two boxers (Clive Curtis and George Lane Cooper) who gave a real knock-em-down performance. It is a movie made of the good stuff of old fashioned entertainment. It wasn&apos;t perfect but it had danger, love, sex, gambling, fist fights, gun play, boat explosion, diamonds, intrigue and treachery. Be sure to catch this one."

But after watching a small and mediocre films as this, now I understand why Villeneuve is special. He made full use of one accident scene and all the desert scenes making the film look almost as beautiful as car chasing scenes in THE DARK KNIGHT and the space sequences in GRAVITY, INTERSTELLAR, etc respectively. He managed to give an average script a direction which is more than extraordinarily.\n\nAlso the performances of both leads were great. The cab driver subplot also had a promising thriller content, which could&apos;ve been more useful if the film had been a thriller.\n\nOverall, beautiful direction and great performances make this mediocre story to be more than one time watch. 7/10 (6 for script, 8 for acting, 9 for direction )",

      "reviewBody": "A big disappointment considering the two legendary leads, Grant and Kerr. And that&apos;s despite a rather promising opening. There&apos;s comedic potential in a jilted love translating a guy&apos;s flowery affections to a non-English new amour. As a result, the movie&apos;s best passages involve Kerr doing just that. Here, however, the idea&apos;s bound up with Middle East intrigue, and distinctly non-comedic mid-eastern types. There&apos;s also comedic potential in watching a woman transition from traditional subservience to modern freedoms. Trouble is these themes fail to catch fire in what amounts to a sloppy screenplay. \n\nToo bad too that Grant appears to be walking through his role in very uncharacteristic fashion. There&apos;s none of his usual bounce or spark. Apparently, he was on the brink of retiring and would not make another feature for two years. So there may well be an inside story to the MGM production. Kerr too seems too dour to be droll in a rather thankless role. At the same time, the results look like director Sheldon had no feel for the antic material, being more a popular writer than director. At least there&apos;s a winsome Betta St. John as the Arabian princess, an aptly commanding Walter Pidgeon as a government honcho, and a fearsome Buddy Baer as a towering enforcer. All in all, however, I expect this was not a movie Grant would like to be remembered by, nor one that his fans will revere him for.\n\n(In passing—Iran&apos;s Prime Minister of the time, Mohammed Mossadegh, gets a quick mention in the dialog. No wonder, because he had just nationalized the country&apos;s oil production and would quickly be deposed by a notorious CIA plot. These events culminated about the time this movie was in production, ie. early 1953, and may well have inspired the premise.)"

I would have liked to see each character fleshed out a bit more.\n\nI also agree that it was a completely one-sided view of international adoption. The whole time watching, I had trouble really understanding most of what was going and why characters were popping in and out of the story."

      "reviewBody": "World War II had several important episodes, but over the years many of them were forgotten or not had due recognition. Besides the famous invasion of Normandy by the Allies, operation known as &quot;D- Day&quot;, The Battle of the Heavy Water also played a key role in the outcome of that war. Directed by Titus Vibe-Müller and Jean Dréville in a French-Norwegian co-production, Kampen om Tungtvannet (original title) or Operation Swallow: The Battle for Heavy Water (in English) is a docudrama (documentary drama) that dramatically presented the reconstitution of these events that marked the history of the world and Norway.\n\nThe film begins by an introduction to the war and the reasons that led France and Germany to become interested in the heavy water produced only in the chemical factory Norsk Hydro, in the Vemork plant on the outskirts of the town of Rjukan in Norway. The first country was seeking it to do research in laboratories on its effectiveness, while the second was aimed at getting it to build a secret weapon. As the heavy water was a byproduct of fertilizer production, its production was limited and on a small scale, which meant that any amount obtained become of paramount importance. While the Norwegians remained neutral in the war, the Allies were able to catch the first batch of the precious liquid. But with the invasion of Norway by the Germans, on the morning of April 9, 1940, the Nazis ordered the Norsk Hydro plant to increase its production. Realizing the threat that the plant had the British Intelligence in London with the Norwegian Resistance came together to take preventive measures and sabotage Nazi Germany&apos;s plans involving heavy water.\n\nShot in black and white and without the aspects of large productions such as extravagant action situations and melodramatic approach, Kampen om Tungtvannet uses archival footage and reconstructs the other scenes with the participation of real life counterparts. This gives the movie plenty of realism and authenticity, as well as historical and educational features. Among the counterparts actors we can quote the scientists Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Lew Kowarski and most of the Norwegian saboteurs. So few characters were played by professional actors and the four native languages ​​of the countries involved in the plot were kept: Norwegian, French, German and English. And it is exactly by the common aspect that this film stands out, especially when we remember what was at stake at that time. These are not synthetic heroes we find in American blockbusters, they are just ordinary men who risked their lives to prevent the victory of the Nazi Germany.\n\nThe photography explores the mountainous region and the harsh climate of Norway through open shots. The rigorous living conditions to which the members of the Norwegian resistance underwent equate to the size of the challenge that was ahead: prevent the Germans build their secret weapon. They faced hunger, cold and also the enemy.\n\nThis story was also dramatized in a British production called The Heroes of the Telemark (1965), with the participation of Kirk Douglas (citing some of his films: Ace in the Hole - 1951, Paths of Glory - 1957, The Vikings - 1958 and Spartacus - 1960) and Richard Harris (known for A Man Called Horse - 1970), and two TV mini-series, a Canadian (A Man Called Intrepid - 1979) and a Norwegian (Kampen om Tungtvannet - Stopping Hitler&apos;s Atomic Bomb - 2015). The Swedish power metal band, Sabaton, also honored this episode through the music called Saboteurs.\n\nWar is not only won in the trenches or in the battle fronts, being fought by artillery fighting, but by the economic, social and mental mobilization in the rearward. It is won by the adopted strategies and resilience, bravery and wit of all its fighters.\n\nOriginally posted in: https://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those wonderful films where everything comes together. The acting and the writing is by far the most impressive elements of this film. William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.\n\nThe true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message. \n\nThe cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.\n\nThis is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970&apos;s (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics. For those educators out there, GREAT film for classes on Media and Politics.",

Josh Hartnett is an experimentalist of an actor gladly . As a private investigator hired to find a hermetic son of a pharma billionaire, he has his own mental battles to fight due to a serial killer in his police past which resulted to him quitting the force, and he delivered well that you will not be distracted by his handsome features at all. The missing party has turned into a faith healer meantime. Why- see it for yourself. This film has strong religious undertones , violence and horrific dead victim images. This film is for those who can take the aforementioned description and may not be suitable for impressionable viewers.",

Sometimes, movies have a way of becoming true reality; and, because the movie gave me a little insight and understanding of the brutality of war, in some way, I owe a debt of gratitude to the movie."

Parents may be present but show no love and do not bond with the child. A sort of re-parenting , going back and providing unconditional love acceptance and understanding, seemed to be at work in the nhs facilities and I think this may be a part of what is at work in the terraced asylum house.\n\nThis is no quick fix , there is the possibility of real change but its definitely a long term plan.",

In one word, it&apos;s a marvellous film which should not be missed!\n\nThe scenery and the images are fantastic. The journey motif makes it the lives that cross one another familiar. And the acting! It totally blew my mind! It seems as if the director is really relating the story of a group of people without ever making his presence felt. It does not feel like you are watching a film at all but from the very first moment you are taken in by the film. \n\nI want to congratulate Nuri Bilge Ceylan and all those contributors in this manner. This was his first film I&apos;ve ever watched and I&apos;ll watch the rest at once without any delay. I already feel like I&apos;ve lost a lot of my precious time...\n\nThanks a lot for this cinematographic marvel, people like you make us realise that cinema is in truth an art; one which keeps mesmerising us all..."

This film isn&apos;t bad at all, but nowhere close to that masterpiece. No question Tran Ahn Hung is a very good filmmaker, but this wasn&apos;t quite compelling enough. Pretty to look at, but not a whole lot else. Ultimately I think the film is just slightly too subdued for it&apos;s own good, and threatens to disappear into it&apos;s own poetic reverie. Also, at times the film was distractingly stagey, not surprising considering that it was shot entirely on a set. Particularly problematic were the outdoor scenes, although there weren&apos;t very many of them.",

And if you want to joke, you don&apos;t hurt yourself by telling the same joke for 10 years...\n\nSo the head of the state is incompetent ? Here&apos;s you see the man who got all powers in France: - keeping the same model of car for 30 years! (What a man opens to modernity!)\n\n\n* saying one thing &amp; do the opposite\n\n\n\n* marrying a woman who don&apos;t like her people\n\n\nIn conclusion, he&apos;s above all a chameleon thirsty for power....\n\nI find Michael Moore more respectable (He don&apos;t like Bush and he has no pity) or Charlie Chaplin, a more honorable artist (when he jokes about the greatest evil of XX century in an unique movie that says it all....)",

      "reviewBody": "So says the grizzled old factory watchman at the conclusion of the folk tale he&apos;s been telling the children huddled around his fire through the Russian night. One of the young boys comes quietly up to him as the others leave, and tells him that he too wants to be a master-stoneworker, like the hero of the story: &quot;ah!&quot;, says the watchman, &quot;you got the point!&quot; And the point&apos;s not just for children, either.\n\nPtushko&apos;s memorably beautiful film makes for a gripping parable about the conflict between the inner and outer life of the born artist, willing to risk sacrificing everything - even the woman he loves - in pursuit of artistic and technical perfection. At the secret heart of the Copper Witch&apos;s caverns, the Stone Flower itself represents that unattainable ideal of beauty, natural material fashioned so cunningly that it seems more real than reality itself. Danila, deeply unsatisfied with his work admired though it is by so many, has to study its form at any price, leaving his betrothal feast to pursue his ideal and hone his technique.\n\nWill Danila break free of the Copper Witch&apos;s charms, and return to the &quot;real world&quot;? You&apos;ll have to watch the film to find out...\n\nWith only four significant characters - the young genius, the ageing and ailing master-craftsman who teaches (or is taught by) him, his faithful betrothed Katinka, and of course the Copper Witch herself - &quot;Kamennyy tsvetok&quot; is much more tightly structured and less riotously inventive than some of the other Ptuchko films I&apos;ve been privileged to see, and the tension never flags.\n\nPolitical content, too, is restrained - surprisingly so, given the film&apos;s date and the fact that it was (as other commentators have pointed out) the first major Russian film to be made in colour. The peasants are duly repressed by the fat and frivolous landowners and their brutal class-traitor henchmen, but (assuming that *my* brain has figured it out correctly!) the clear message is that whatever its conflicts with everyday life and relationships, art certainly transcends politics and class. Surprising indeed. There&apos;s even a moment in the beautifully depicted and choreographed folk betrothal where religious icons are bowed to with grace and reverence. It is amazing that Ptushko was daring enough to try to get that one past the censors, let alone manage to succeed! \n\nThe commentator who compared the visual feast on offer with Powell and Pressburger&apos;s roughly contemporary &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was spot on: their &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot; is even closer in spirit. Ptushko&apos;s visual imagination and daring are in that league, and his colour process produced really breathtaking pictures. If his images here seem more illustrative and pictorial, less intrinsically filmic than the art of those English masters, they are none the less memorable. The magic scenes in the woods, and in the gem-sparkling caverns, are of a loveliness seldom matched in film of any era, and never surpassed.\n\nThe currently available RUSCICO DVD version is quite beautifully restored visually, and the sound is very acceptable too. With good extras, including a half-hour feature about Ptushko&apos;s life and work showcasing extracts from many of his other films, why not treat yourself and your family, if you have one, to this rich folk-tale? If you respond to it as I did, you may even manage - for one brief, shining moment - to feel that you are nine years old once again!",

      "reviewBody": "The &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; movies are a series of films about the experiences of young triads in Hong Kong&apos;s criminal society. They are based on a Hongkongese comic book known as &quot;Teddy Boy&quot;, a fact which would be unknown if not for the movie often cutting to hand-drawn images, revealing how closely the film resembles the comic book.\n\nThe film&apos;s structure seems to be fairly episodic; there&apos;s not much of an overarching narrative that I could detect, and thus the scenes only have power based on the performances. The stand-outs for me were Ekin Cheng as the protagonist and the stunningly beautiful Gigi Lai as his love interest.\n\nDespite being a HK crime flick, &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; isn&apos;t heroic bloodshed; there&apos;s very little gunplay and none of the violence is shot in balletic fashion. \n\nUnfortunately, with little cohesion to each scene, &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot;&apos;s power feels muted, especially in its climax; however it is entertaining for most of its run-time.",

      "reviewBody": "Most of this movie is a run-of-the-mill musical comedy. Palace intrigue in a small fantasy country, two boys, two girls, guess how it ends...\n\nBut a few scenes struck me. Benjamin (Heinz Rühmann) and Manja (Maria Sazarina, age 20 then) at the buffet, overdosing their snacks with hot pepper (Paprika). Both incurring breathing problems, craving for drinks to relieve their throats, end up via a defective elevator in the wine cellar of the duke&apos;s castle, and selectively quench their thirsts, plus some pickled cucumbers. Much wine is consumed, and they fool around - Benjamin directing an orchestra of small wine barrels, Manja doing a really exquisite solo dance on the big wine barrels. Really worth seeing! Later, the other two heroes join them - Antonio (Lous Graveur) and duchess Stephanie (Camilla Horn), the two contenders to the crown. Some unseen foe locks the door, so they&apos;re all caught in the cellar.\n\nStill later, Benjamin and Antonio (who really &quot;is&quot; a famous opera tenor) make music, and the girls listen from upstairs, and Manja does another solo dance (not as wild as the first), leading to her waltzing with Stephanie.\n\nSo far for my highlights, the rest is more comedy routine - Heinz Rühmann does his job being funny, Theo Lingen less so. But Maria Sazarina&apos;s dances beat all. She was Russian, acted in only six films 1934-40, and Wikipedia doesn&apos;t even list her. Watching more German movies from the 1930s, I&apos;m always astonished by the actresses to discover there - not star-billed (my last were Hilde Weissner and Trude Berliner). What a talent pool there was, working in the movie industry to provide escapist emotional relief from Nazism and later WW2...",

John was a children&apos;s show host in Syracuse, but also has a love for horror films, and becomes a television horror film host in Oakland. On one level, the film is just a drama about the Leary&apos;s trying to settle into their new life. On another level, Jack The Bear is about confronting various kinds of monsters, from make-believe to human, as well as more abstract &quot;monsters&quot;, including behaviors that are difficult to control and accidental tragedies such as deaths.\n\nI&apos;ve seen Jack The Bear a few times now, and every time I see it I like it even better. The performances are fantastic, taking you on a roller coaster of emotions. But it almost requires multiple viewings to really &quot;get&quot; the film. At its heart is the growing presence and threat of the various &quot;monsters&quot; mentioned above. The various monsters are all woven together in very complex ways, and most of the developments later on in the film are about how those monsters can be conquered, but always at some price. Just as the threads are densely combined, so is the vanquishing of the monsters, and both the development of the monsters and the &quot;solutions&quot; to them are like various pieces of a large jigsaw puzzle, each piece necessary for the whole, and often affecting the whole in unexpected ways.\n\nThe direction, script, editing, cinematography, and all of the technical aspects are impeccable. The score is also wonderful and not only enhances the setting, but underscores the dramatic developments if you listen to the lyrics closely.\n\nA 10 out of 10 from me. Don&apos;t miss this film.",

From the first one in the eighties unto today nobody really liked them. Or they were cursed with poor effects, or with sad CGI. But number 3 in the franchise, is the best of them. Again it is a mix between CGI and at last a real person. And that makes it all a bit creepier. to compare it with the first one, there is already T&amp;A in the first minutes and there is already blood too, two things we missed in the first part. And there is a lot of blood. Sometimes gallons of the red stuff flows on screen. They even put a bit of gore in it. A bit of lack of suspense in the storyline but it&apos;s a good starter for an entertaining evening.",

      "reviewBody": "Montana Moon (1930) \n\n** (out of 4) \n\nIncredibly uneven film about a rich brat (Joan Crawford) who gets off the train she&apos;s on after feeling guilty for messing with a man (Ricardo Cortez) that her best friend is in love with. Once off the train she finds herself in a small town where she meets cowboy Larry (Johnny Mack Brown) and the two quickly fall in love and marry but it doesn&apos;t take long for her desire for her &quot;other life&quot; to destroy the current relationship. MONTANA MOON is without question one of the most uneven movies that I&apos;ve ever seen from this period of Hollywood. For the life of me it seemed like someone was carrying the screenplay but ran into someone else carrying a different screenplay and the two scripts just got mixed together. For starters, there are so many different genres being tried here and very few of them work. You&apos;ve got the actual romance between Crawford and Johnny Mack Brown and this here actually does work and especially their &quot;falling in love&quot; scenes early in the picture. What does work are some really bad musical numbers that are thrown in as well as some comedy from Benny Rubin and Cliff Edwards. I know early talkies wanted to give people everything in regards to drama, music and laughs but it makes for such an uneven ride here that the entire movie just takes on a rather weird vibe. What keeps the movie slightly entertaining are the performances. Crawford is absolutely gorgeous here and manages to make you really hate her character at times and love her at others. I thought she was really good early on when she was the bad girl but once she meets the cowboy, I also believed the way she fell in love like a little girl. Johnny, on the other hand, is fairly good, although I&apos;m not sure if some of his awkward line deliveries were a part of his character or just him struggling with the part. Either way, the two of them made for a great couple. Cortez is the typical punk that he always played but it was nice seeing him. MONTANA MOON isn&apos;t a film most are going to enjoy but if you&apos;re a fan of Crawford then it&apos;s worth sitting through once."

It has Roger Carmel, &quot;Star Trek&apos;s&quot; own Harry Mudd playing the father. They get to stop a truck carrying tainted drinks. They smash up the wrong truck at a store. They were able to find and stop the truck and its selling of bad refreshments.\n\nMore high octane. Close to the birth of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. This is something to watch on late night.\n\n2.5 out of 5 stars.",

As the film opens an attempt is made to kidnap Miki, the daughter of a Japanese businessman, aboard a flight... this is thwarted by four of the Chai Lai. The fifth is outside her father&apos;s house where he is being threatened by thugs. It turns out the thugs, led by a man known as Dragon, are after the &apos;Pearl of the Andaman&apos;s&apos;; it is owned by Miki&apos;s father but she too knows its location. Dragon&apos;s next attempt at kidnapping Miki is successful; the Chai Lais must rescue her before Dragon gets his hands on the Pearl.\n\nWhen I sat down to watch this I wasn&apos;t sure if it was going to be utter rubbish or good cheesy fun... it was the latter and as it happened better than I&apos;d hoped for. The story is relatively simple but serves to provide a near constant stream of action set pieces. The action isn&apos;t exactly realistic but it is exciting; providing thrills and laughs in equal measure. The five protagonists are as sexy as one would expect in a film inspired by Charlie&apos;s Angels; the acting might not be the greatest but it was far from being bad. The antagonists were decent; Dragon was okay but his henchman, the cross-dressing &apos;King Kong&apos; steals most of the scenes he is in. There is a fair amount of blatant fan service as the girls fight in bikinis and towels and in one scene Rose dances in her underwear; this might not be politically correct but it never crossed the line to being sleazy. Overall I&apos;d say that while this might not be a great film it is a lot of fun if you like action/comedy films led by good looking women!\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Thai with English subtitles. Of possible interest the DVD I watched claimed to be &apos;Region One&apos; but played on my &apos;Region Two&apos; DVD player.",

The performance of the male lead is magical.  His facial expressions and mannerisms light up the movie, and the female lead matches his enthusiasm perfectly.  The music in the movie is superb, and launches the viewer into a place and time of beauty and substance.\n\nAlthough the English subtitles are misspelled through most of the film, I (a native English speaker from America), and all the Chinese friends who were watching with me were moved to tears.  I recommend it to anyone of any nationality."

The seemingly serious screenplay is laced with humorous moments which makes the film a nice breezy watch at just about two hours thirty minutes of its run time.\n\nThe films truly belongs to Antara Mali who delivers her career best performance as a Madhuri fan with a go-get it attitude. She has brought such an innocent charm in Chutki that you root for her every time she gets in to trouble. You just want her to win though it appears impracticable. That is the sweetness Antara lends her character and elevates the film to a cut above the common place. Rajpal Yadav, fine actor that he is, brings in a certain amount of earnestness in his act. Govind Namdev, playing the manager who tries to help Chutki, is also impressive.\n\nOn the flipside, the film only skims the surface of the casting couch syndrome without getting in to the gory details. A peripheral actor does try to take advantage of Chutki but it is all done and dusted with pronto. A little more insight in to the functioning of the Hindi film industry could have taken this movie to an altogether different level.\n\nNevertheless, Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon is one of the better products coming from RGV factory. Like Antara loves Madhuri, I started loving Antara after this film. Recommended watch!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",

      "reviewBody": "Miserly Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Seymour Hicks and looking particularly decrepit) is given a tour of his cold, grasping Christmases - past, present and future - by the restless shade of his deceased partner Jacob Marley. Similar to the 1901 Robert Paul version, the iconic three ghosts are replaced by Marley (a deviation from the original popularised in J. C. Buckstone&apos;s 1901 theatrical retelling). Typical of the era, special effects are simple double exposures but that doesn&apos;t detract from the &apos;dreaminess&apos; of the story and Hicks, who frequently played the humbugging skin-flint is quite good (he also stared in a &apos;talkie version&apos; in 1932). The film opens with a brief introduction to the provenance of the original story and (unlike the earlier silent versions) there are extensive intertitles featuring lines of dialogue that will be familiar to anyone who has read the book or seen the &apos;talkie&apos; versions. The version I recently watched on You-tube would have benefitted from a musical score.",

      "reviewBody": "I love this film and that&apos;s the reason I&apos;m adding a review to a film that already has 30 reviews. First of all, many previous reviewers complain that this is not a typical horror movie from the period. For example there is no Karloff or Lugosi in a starring role. That is true, but the film plays more like a breezy, fast paced Warner Bros. B&apos; crime film. I have no problem with that. Although the horror isn&apos;t stressed, the finale with Bogart taking the girl to the abandoned farm house is pretty spooky.\n\nI argue with those saying the cast isn&apos;t very good. While Bogart isn&apos;t at home playing a corpse who has returned to life, he doesn&apos;t disappoint. John Litel, is over the top (and great) as the doctor who returns Bogart from the dead. Finally Wayne Morris, who is the real star of the film, plays the wise guy reporter investigating the strange happenings. The rest of the cast is well above average for a &quot;chunk it out as fast as possible&quot; B&apos; picture. This includes, Dennis Morgan, Rosemary Lane, Huntz Hall, and the spooky Lya Lys.\n\nThis is no masterpiece, but this is fast and fun and never boring for a second. Ah, if only there were only more films like this. Who doesn&apos;t love a Bogart zombie film? Must viewing for any film buff.",

Its only tie however is a brief appearance by Jamie Far as The Shiek within the first few minutes of the movie. After that the movie severs most of its ties with the first two save for the race. Here a new crop of Cannon Ballers run the race while being pursued by Spiro T. Edsel a sheriff in the mold of Bufford T. Justice (a character played by the late Jackie Gleason on the Smokey and the Bandit series). Now believe it or not this is actually a decent movie when viewed outside of the Cannon Ball Run series.

When he takes her back to the immense family farm, there are mixed reactions to her; sister-in-law Fay Bainter hates her, but Margaret Sullavan is friendly. When, however, it becomes clear that Young and Miss Crawford lust for each other, things become dramatic.\n\nThe first twenty minutes of this, set in the big city, are excellent, with the cocktail set the brothers associate with having many catty remarks to make about La Crawford, and Young certainly plays grumpy well. Once it gets to the country, however, this turns into a Code-compliant, Peyton Place film, and those two simply do not mix well. Everyone does well in their roles, although Douglas isn&apos;t given much to do, and only Miss Sullavan is excellent. Crawford had wanted her for the role, and Mayer had tried to talk her out of it, pointing out that Miss Sullavan would steal the show. Miss Crawford responded that she would rather be a supporting player in a great movie than a lead in a stinker. This one is neither, but although I enjoyed it a lot, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a very good film.",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this film when I was 15, and was pretty wowed by it, especially it&apos;s high level use of the F word. Just recently watching it again, there wasn&apos;t that much bad language. Later discovering this was a Robert Altman film, this didn&apos;t surprise me, as he did another set piece one, continual scene film, &apos;Come Back To The Five And Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&apos; at the same time. There is actually a preview of the latter on this film, if you have a VHS copy, which I luckily do. Streamers works mainly cause of the powerful performances, notably Michael Wright, what you may call a deserter, off his nut, who crashes a dorm of Vets, still waiting on their orders to fight that notorious and unforgotten war. He&apos;s so powerfully unsettling, because you don&apos;t what he&apos;&apos; do next. It&apos;s like watching a bi polar patient. The other notable performance is that of Guy Boyd, a great underused actor, as a gung ho sergeant, who sadly, you don&apos;t see much of him in this, either. Modine is very strong too as Wright&apos;s rival, while Mitchell Lichstein is unforgettably great as the gay homo cadet, who brings so much to the role, an array of emotions. What happened to him? Streamers is basically a character driven, one scene movie, where the tenseness and anxiousness shows in these pre Vet soldiers, one young kid, slashing his wrists at the start, to get a pardon, with one of the creepiest faces I&apos;ve ever seen. If part of this character, I give the actor full credit. David Allen Grier, a good underrated actor plays another black GI, and Wright&apos;s friend. The atmosphere of these actors, doing their thing in a confined set is electric, even the smaller performances as we near it&apos;s end, after a double tragedy were great. The films not for everyone, as there are some confronting issues, in what in a pull no punches tale of innocence lost, and tempers flaring of a bunch of apprehensive soldiers, waiting to partake in that ugly war. The highpoint is watching a drunk Guy Boyd (and he&apos;s like this for all his scenes) singing instead of Beautiful Dreamer, Beautiful Streamers. George Dzunda, delivers too, especially near the end as Boyd&apos;s compadre. The marching gun display in perfect cadence at the start and end credits in frighteningly unsurpassable. Engaging viewing, where if not for the actors, this dorm would coming down.",

The best I can say about it is that if you are looking for a movie that will make you writhe in discomfort for a couple hours (which is what I was hoping for), this will probably do the trick. The first two stories have the combined effect of making you never want to have sex again. The fourth attempts (less successfully) to put you off both sex and food. The third is a bit of breather in that it has none of the grisly horror of the others and feels like a decent, thoughtful movie that was mistakenly put in the reel. The central narrative, unfortunately, is pretty dull. All of the stories together, while varying in tone, can be boiled down to one basic message: women should be feared. The movie on the whole is an admirable effort and there are certain images that will stay with you for all time either for their grossness or coolness (the breast surgery and the womb-cam in particular), but it does feel like it could have achieved a lot more.",

      "reviewBody": "The First Nightmare on Elm Street was scary and original. It had the great idea of a killer killing people in their dreams. All of its sequels (except for part 2, which went in a horrible direction) just built on to that idea, and the idea wasn&apos;t scary anymore as the series progressed. Now with New Nightmare, Wes Craven came up with another original idea. It turns out that Freddy is in fact real, some kind of ancient evil that took the form of Freddy Krueger and could only be contained through storytelling, IE: the Nightmare On Elm Street movies. But since the series has ended, the genie is out of the bottle, and this ingenious film unravels.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t say this movie is that scary, it&apos;s more creepy than it is scary, but I love its imagination. It plays mind little mind games and you wonder what is real and what is not. Freddy Krueger is even credited as &quot;himself&quot;. It&apos;s a must-see for any Freddy fan and in many ways it stands on its own...but only if you&apos;ve seen the other movies. If that makes any sense.\n\nThis is one of the best sequels in the Nightmare series and it&apos;s nothing short of brilliant. It&apos;s nice to see that Freddy is back in the bottle where he belongs, and hopefully will be for a long time...\n\nMy Rating: 9/10",

It should be noted that the relationship between the Beauty and the Beast is the main focus of the story here unlike most adaptations that derail the story with too many subplots such as a jealous suitor of Beauty and/or what her family is up to etc. The only subplot is that of the enchantress&apos;s character but the actress gives such a magnificent performance that it is forgivable. While it is obvious that this production was made on a tight budget, this does not undercut the magnetic chemistry between the two leads or the enchanting soundtrack scored by the late, great Edison Denisov.",

      "reviewBody": "Kidz in da Hood screened as part of MIFF&apos;s New Gen strand for children. MIFF notes recommended it for audiences aged 12+, though in the absence of much children&apos;s cinema, and with my 6 year old having had much access to adult world cinema, I had no hesitation in taking him. While the film has &quot;mild sexual references and mild coarse language&quot;, it really shouldn&apos;t be an issue for anyone but the prudish.\n\nThe film depicts an orphaned nine year old refugee facing deportation from Sweden and how she finds shelter in a run-down public housing block, staying with a punk rocker. For me, a good children&apos;s film should cater for all ages, including adults, which means not underestimating the intelligence of children. Kidz in da Hood doesn&apos;t quite meet this criteria, yet my son enjoyed it immensely, as did the group of several children in front of us aged 8 - 12.\n\nIt tackles issues of ethnicity, acceptance, crime and humanitarianism in a manner that is digestible for children, so is worth seeing for that alone. My son gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I picked up this film solely because it was an inexpensive film made during the early golden years of Corean cinema. The story is simply about the struggles a coachman and his family deal with in the modernizing city of Seoul.\n\nSurprisingly, even though it&apos;s not necessarily a happy film, it&apos;s still quite full of hope. The other thing is that, despite the ultimate upbeat nature of the film, it&apos;s decidedly Corean. We have a Corean family, a widower coachman who works day in and day out as a coachman to support his children. He&apos;s got issues, in terms of parenting and that comes to light through the film, but it&apos;s clear that he desires more for his children. There&apos;s the prototypical dutiful eldest son who is the father&apos;s bright hope for the family. There&apos;s the typical troubled younger daughter, whose selfish desires for status and material gain cause her to get in trouble. Interestingly enough, there&apos;s a mute older daughter who is trapped in a loveless marriage--but because of Corean societal rules, cannot return to her home anymore; although that doesn&apos;t keep her from trying. And then there&apos;s a love interest for our coachman, a widow and maid to the horse&apos;s owner.\n\nSo the story isn&apos;t too bad overall, except that the ending is too neat and clean and resolves everything without the main characters really being involved in the resolution. The other films I&apos;ve watched from this era avoid this need for simple resolutions, especially with a story and situations as complex as the ones presented in this film. I see that as a weakness, although it doesn&apos;t make this film any less valuable as a story about a troubled family trying to make it in postwar Seoul.\n\nThe resolution of the film is too easy, but it&apos;s otherwise a decent film and a nice document of the times. 7/10.",

He looks like he took took the &apos;method-acting&apos; thing seriously, as with his appearance in TRUE ROMANCE, I doubt he took even one shower in 1992.\n\nDuchovny &amp; Forbes were also fine as the normal half of this &quot;ride share from hell&quot;, but I&apos;m guessing Juliette Lewis&apos; naive &quot;jailbait&quot; turned off a few people (see NBK or CAPE FEAR for further proof).  Just ignore her grating &amp; whiny delivery, and go along for the wild ride all the way to KALIFORNIA."

Just a few elements to keep in mind: Mercenaries, an Armoured Train, a Nazi, Diamonds, Goofy UN Soldiers, a Drunk doctor, Yvette Mimeux, Jim Brown, a Moral ending, a chain saw fight, and more then a few scenes and lines that make you wonder why you never heard of this movie before. Rod Taylor is perfect for the lead role in this movie with such lines as: &quot;Why don&apos;t you put that Swastika back on....you&apos;ve earned it!&quot;...I can&apos;t say enough about this movie.  The book by Wilbur Smith &quot;Train From Katanga&quot; is an excellent read as well.",

      "reviewBody": "Honestly, it is really sweet and genuinely memorable, full of powerful messages of Christmas. I think it is one of the better Christmas videos out there, and there are a lot of very good ones, like Enchanted Christmas. Here, we have three stories, like Cinderella 2 and Belle&apos;s Magical World, but I would definitely pick Mickey&apos;s Once Upon a Christmas over both those films put together. It is a little short, but with the sweetness of the entire movie, the top notch voice talents and the surprisingly good animation, that is so easy to forgive. The highlight of the film was the beautiful, restrained intonation of Kelsey Grammar&apos;s narration, and he was the main reason why I got the video in the first place. The material he was given was beautifully written, and he made the most with it. The animation was surprisingly good, I was expecting worse, but the animation was actually one of the many redeeming qualities of this movie. The three stories are inspired and very well-done, my favourite being the last one with Mickey and Minnie. Plus the inspired moments of comedy like Donald chasing a turkey and lovely music and a musical yultide interlude at then end that is enough to touch the heart. All in all, a beautiful and touching yuletide movie, with a 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox",

The lead character is a guy, and well sometimes all we guys see is the outer beauty. The lead character is willing to overlook the fact that she is a horrible person. We have all tried to hang on to a girl who when in perspective we look back and think &quot;what the hell was I thinking?&quot; I am sure that girls have had the same experiences in their lives. I think the guy was a little whinny though, and after a period of a few months he should have just let her go. Milla is so cute and sweet, you keep thinking to yourself, is this guy blind or what. That is the problem with love, it tends to make fools of us all. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes not. I recommend renting this one if only to look at some of the situations and say to yourself, hey that is me!",

      "name": "LÖNS&apos; LIFE EXCUSE FOR A HEIMATFILM",
      "reviewBody": "The life of German journalist/writer/poet Hermann Löns is supposed to be the subject of the film; well, to be honest, the credits already warn that the film is based on &quot;ideas taken from the biography by Dr. Wilhelm Deimann&quot;. The life of Löns is a poor excuse for a slightly above average Heimatfilm with the standard ingredients of plenty of landscape, sentimental love stories and a couple of folklore songs and dances and very little of the life, let alone an insight in the literature, of Löns. One wonders how much time Löns could have had for writing his prose, poetry and being a journalist if so much of his time is used for keeping his marriage intact.\n\nThere are some enormous discrepancies between this Löns and the real Löns. I can not think of any other reason than the average conventional German mentality of the 50&apos;s that made the makers decide to let him keep his marriage until 1914. In fact his wife Lisa left him in 1910 after which Löns had a nervous breakdown and traveled through Europe for about 2 years. In this film he never leaves the moor and only has a slight attack of fever. From 1912 he lived together with Ernestin Sassenberg in Hannover, that is: without being married and that would have been a problem in a mainstream German film in the 50&apos;s.\n\nThis is still an entertaining film though. The cast is fine and director Karl Hartl has good control over the material and avoids it resulting into exaggerated sentimentality. Good cinematography, ditto music and pacing. (6/10)",

Also on view is Gordon Mitchell as a deliciously insane bandit leader who spends a lot of time talking to himself in the mirror. Also playing poker against himself in the mirror... Shots of horsemen riding along the horizon take up screen time and build the slim story up to ninety minutes or so of questionable action. Fidani has been compared to Ed Wood, but this one is pretty well done, with a top-notch score, plenty of extras milling about in the backgrounds, some nice town sets, a few gorgeous ladies, and an incredible stunt team who flop and twitch when they&apos;re shot; no slumping to the ground for them, they usually fly from twelve to fifteen feet when shot. Fans of the genre just might have a good time with this one; others beware!",

      "reviewBody": "This drive-in schlockfest has Pamela Franklin starring as a Los Angeles woman who moves to a bizarre small town in Northern California with her husband (Michael Ontkean) where he is to be employed for a toy company. The longer she spends there, the more disconcerted she becomes over the influence his boss, Mr. Cato (Orson Welles), has on the townspeople, which consist exclusively of young, fresh-faced hippies with a taste for all things occult.\n\n&quot;Necromancy&quot; had a troubled release history and was apparently re-edited to some degree in the early 1980s and re-released as a softcore film under the title &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;; the cut of the film I saw was apparently an early R-rated cut under the &quot;Necromancy&quot; title that is allegedly close to writer-director Burt Gordon&apos;s original vision, if you want to call it that. &quot;Necromancy&quot; as a whole feels like a &quot;vision&quot; of sorts-a hazy, drugged-out romp through Manson family-era California, with a supernatural twist. It suffers terribly from disjointed editing and a general lack of cohesion, which is disappointing given that the narrative is actually quite straightforward.\n\nThe film will remain an eternal curiosity for Welles&apos;s involvement, though his role is minimal and his presence generally underwhelming. The lovely Pamela Franklin (who many genre fans know and love from &quot;The Innocents&quot; and &quot;Legend of Hell House&quot;) is a formidable lead and does what she can with the material; a strappingly handsome Michael Ontkean plays her husband and is less impressive but still has a likable screen presence; and Lee Purcell (later of Wes Craven&apos;s TV schlocker &quot;Summer of Fear&quot;) is aptly doe-eyed and dead-faced as a distant member of the town/coven trying to revive Welles&apos;s dead son.\n\nThe film has a clever albeit rather standard twist that gives it a fun bite considering most of it is rather straightforward despite its acid-trip aesthetics. In the end, the film suffers greatly from serious disjointedness (presumably because it is so badly edited), but there are some ominous, utterly bizarre (and sometimes eerie) visuals throughout that are distinct to the era. Ultimately, what we have here is a drive-in-calibre occult flick, which, depending on who you are, may or may not be a complete delight. For visuals alone, I feel it&apos;s worth watching, though it does present itself as a serious case of &quot;what might have been.&quot; 7/10.",

This one is much better than the first (Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla 2002) by far. The story is very interesting this go around. The people of Japan are warned that if they do not dismantle Kiryu then Mothra will not fight for them rather against them.\n\nThis movie also has key elements from previous movies such as Mothra, and Godzilla vs Mothra, while still staying true to the 2002 flick. The special effects get better with each movie especially Godzilla&apos;s thermanuclear blast. The monster battles in this one were good as well, some reviewers think Godzilla has to be super evil to have good monster battles, shame on them. Mothra did her parts to hold off Godzilla until Hio and Mana (the larva) shows up.\n\nI won&apos;t spoil the movie or the ending for you, but the doorway for Godzilla Final Wars has been busted open. Again don&apos;t trust reviews from critics whom couldn&apos;t tell you the difference between Godzilla and Zilla. This is a definite buy and an enjoyable movie. Who says you have to be a kid to appreciate the action of a Godzilla movie? Check this one out, you won&apos;t be disappointed."

I glanced over it, then after awhile , I said, I should watch this before its taken down (hulu takes movies down some reason..space maybe for newer movies to come in?)\n\nAnyway, glad I did, very inspirational movie, I felt at times I wanted to cry. It&apos;s so unique, its rare I think, I don&apos;t think many know about this movie, its no so big like Pixar or from a company I ever heard of, but its still great! \n\nI recommend this movie, good animation, funny at times, its worth a watch. I&apos;m not sure if its on DVD but if it is, I&apos;d buy it :) \n\nOne thing I didn&apos;t understand was, the boy has cancer, and they kept telling him to believe and to have faith, how can faith change the cancer inside you, to fight it off? I guess it&apos;s because you never know what will happen, but hope for the best, but at the same time, not getting your hopes up or dashed dreams! \n\nGreat movie, I love it!",

      "reviewBody": "A man named Mike Enslin (John Cusack ,though Keanu Reeves was attached for playing lead role in the movie) writes books evaluating supernatural phenomena in hotels, and other haunted locations , as he specializes in debunking paranormal occurrences . Shortly thereafter Mike meets the manager of the hotel Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) and he checks into the fabled room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel . Soon after settling in , he confronts genuine terror and stays locked-up . Later on , he gets to communicate his wife (Kate Walsh was originally cast in this film, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflict and she was replaced by Mary McCormack) by means of a computer . \n\nThis exciting film based on the terrifying story by Stephen King contains chills , thrills , suspense , and supernatural situations . The picture succeeds because the thriller , tension , suspense , as well as a superbly written script delving into the human psyche in such extreme situation and ours instinctive urges for survival . The screenplay manages to be intelligent , intriguing and thrilling , the good thing about this film is that the director made it on an acceptable budget only having to do a few sets , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . Extraordinary performance from John Cusack in his second appearance in a Stephen King film adaptation , the first was Stand by Me. The picture bears certain relation with ¨The Shining¨ both movies were also shot at the same studio - Elstree, in London . The story this film was based on was almost never written ,Stephen King originally created the first few pages of &apos;1408&apos; for his nonfiction book, &quot;On Writing,&quot; as an example of how to revise a first draft. The story, however, intrigued him, and he wound up not only finishing a complete draft, but adapting it for an audio-book compilation of short stories. Colorful and evocative cinematography by magnificent cameraman Benoît Delhomme . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Gabriel Yared who had formerly won an Academy Award for Anthony Minghella&apos;s The English patient . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Mikael Hafstrom , an expert on terror and sinister atmospheres as proved in ¨Drowning ghost¨, ¨Evil ¨, ¨The rite¨ , and of course ¨1408¨, he&apos;s now filming ¨The Tomb¨. Rating : Good , above average . The picture will appeal to Terror buffs and Joan Cusack fans .This is without a doubt a thought-provoking and mysterious film to be liked for terror fans , turning out to be one of the most original horror movies of the last years .",

      "reviewBody": "A touch of the New Vague: Berlin shortly before the construction of the Wall with Loni von Friedl and GOLDEN GLOBE nominee Hardy Krüger\n\nIn the very worth seeing ARTE documentary &quot;The Hardy Krüger Story&quot;, Hardy Krüger talks about this wonderful film, which was shot in the early summer before the Wall was built on August 13, 1961. With this film, the actor, who has now become a world-famous star, wanted to create a cinematic monument to his hometown of Berlin. Unfortunately that failed! When the film, produced by UFA Film Hansa, premiered in Hanover on October 12, 1961, the Berlin Wall had already been a bitter reality for two months. In other respects too, the production was not a lucky star. The fabulous director and GOLDEN GLOBE winner Victor Vicas (Weg ohne Umkehr, 1954) fell ill and had to be replaced by assistant director Wieland Liebske. The result is nevertheless a fine and touching Berlin film, which - following in the footsteps of the French Nouvelle Vague and also the Italian Neorealismo - offers a quasi-documentary look at Berlin, divided into sectors, before the Wall was built. An everyday love story is shown sketchily and poetically and looks at living conditions that are not entirely easy with sober seriousness. Simply fabulous how a German film with realism instead of a dream factory combines the painful topic of divided Berlin with the reality of small people&apos;s lives.\n\nThe smart East Berliner Karl (Hardy Krüger) helps young Christine (Loni von Friedl), who has just come from Rostock to the GDR capital, to get to the western part of Berlin. In addition to his actual job in the East, he also works in a pub in Kreuzberg. Of course for hard D-Marks! Karl dreams of taking over the pub from his boss (Joseph Offenbach) and his wife (Ilse Fürstenberg). Karl falls in love with Christine, who experiences her first disappointments in the West. Getting married soon. And then there is actually a chance that Karl could use his savings to take over the pub, if not...\n\nWalter Giller (1927-2011) plays another role as Paulchen, Karl&apos;s best friend. He and his wife Nadja Tiller were one of the real dream couples in German film in those years. Great images from Kreuzberg and the Kurfürstendamm and the Gedächtniskirche / Memorial Church make this film, shot in black and white, a pleasure. Even if the construction of the wall ruined the success at the box office (Billy Wilder&apos;s &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; had a similar fate), the artistic value did not go undiscovered. The enchanting Loni von Friedl (born in 1943 / married to EUROPEAN FILM AWARD nominee Götz George from 1966-1976) deservedly received the Filmband in Gold /GERMAN FILM PRIZE. The film also screened at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina. In English the film is known as &quot;Two Among Millions&quot;.\n\nA beautiful film with a touching, unspectacular love story that you should definitely see!",

      "reviewBody": "MGM&apos;s loss was Universal Studio&apos;s gain when Louis B. Mayer sold Deanna Durbin&apos;s contract to Carl Laemmle and Universal gave her a grand debut in Three Smart Girls. The three are the Craig sisters played by Nan Grey, Barbara Read, and Durbin as the youngest and the one with the musical talent. But all three are on a mission to bring their mother and father back together.\n\nThe girls are vacationing in Switzerland when word comes that dear old dad who&apos;s been divorced from mom for years is about to be married again. Back to New York come the sisters to save father Charles Winninger from the clutches of mercenary Binnie Barnes and her even more mercenary mother Alice Brady. \n\nWhile on the mission Grey and Read get themselves some romantic involvement also with Dusty King and Ray Milland. It gets a bit complicated though when Read thinks that Milland is a no account count that King hired to woo Barnes away from Winninger. Actually Milland is a titled gent, the guy that King hired was Mischa Auer.\n\nIn the first of her many roles in the guise, Deanna Durbin plays little Miss Fix-it and solves everybody&apos;s problems in the end with a few songs to go with it. It was a formula that worked well for Universal, pulling the studio back from inherent bankruptcy. Abbott&amp;Costello would later make it turn a profit.\n\nThree Smart Girls got Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Original Story. The fashions and mores of the time place it firmly in the Depression Thirties. I doubt it could ever be made today again.\n\nWhere would you find a voice like Deanna Durbin&apos;s?",

Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. \n\nIt&apos;s a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn&apos;t really deliver in that department either. \n\nWhat you are left with is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography, cast and the tight music score, you&apos;re left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal. \n\nThis was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.",

You never know what you&apos;re going to get when it comes to the &quot;romantic comedy&quot;, and this is a breath of fresh air for the genre. Is the formula that new? Not really - but the off color humor, performances of the actors and actresses, and Michael Ian Black&apos;s writing more than make up for any flaws the movie might have. This is just the type of flick to see if you need a good laugh and don&apos;t mind your humor on the lowbrow side of things. If you&apos;re looking for a blockbuster, this movie won&apos;t be for you - but honestly, who needs anything that masterful when it comes to entertainment for entertainment&apos;s sake? Give it a watch...unless you&apos;ve got no sense of humor, you&apos;ll at least get some good laughs out of it.",

Bit by bit he starts to loose it....\n\nForm: It plays out very neatly. You have to follow the story tightly to make any sense of the whole thing. Follow closely and you get a reward at the end in the form of knowledge on the human mind.\n\nWho is it for?: First of all this is not a movie for kids. It is a highly realistic movie with a hard story,lots of violence and gore and an adult theme. So if you are a sensitive viewer or under 17  I would not recommend it for viewing. There are a lot of non-violent films out there about similar topics. But on the other hand if you don`t have a problem with violence in films and like a touch of realism, this is really the one for you.\n\n Grade: 10 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "The movie opens with a view of rural Minnesota, accompanied by 1950&apos;s radio...music, farm report, commodity prices, etc. It quickly moves to Mickey&apos;s Diner, an establishment located just a few blocks from the Fitzgerald Theater in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. There we see Guy Noir, whose job is managing security for the &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; radio program. Soon we are in the theater, preparing for the live performance of the radio program. Virtually all the remainder of the movie happens in the Fitzgerald.\n\nNote: I have attended two APHC performances in the Fitzgerald, and have eaten in Mickey&apos;s Diner. The exteriors in the movie are all real, and the stage, the sets and auditorium shots of the Fitzgerald are likewise genuine. Even a brief shot of a church near the theater, toward the end of the movie, is genuine. You can see some photos at PHCFan.com. The stage action in the movie is just like it happens in real life. Whether the dressing-room scenes and GK&apos;s disregard for deadlines are similar to real-life, I don&apos;t know.\n\nDuring much of the movie we are puzzled by a mysterious woman in white who has certainly caught Guy Noir&apos;s eye...her garments are so tight he can &quot;read the embroidery on her panties.&quot; She walks calmly around the stage and through the set during the show itself. We learn her identity in the second half of the movie.\n\nThe real-life Sue Scott plays a hairdresser in the movie, a speaking role. Even if you don&apos;t recognize her face you will recognize her voice. All the other regulars seem to play themselves.\n\nThe movie audience really enjoyed the movie. We laughed heartily at the jokes, and applauded at the end. It is a feel-good movie, a must-see for fans of the weekly radio program.",

It&apos;s a very personal family story that is told almost like a detective story about a grandson trying to open up his old grandmother that lives in a small island. It has a lot of humor even though the theme is so serious, I was quite surprised about that. The whole cinema was laughing many times. \n\nIt reminded me of the film Stories we tell by Sarah Polly which is also a family story told almost like it was a thriller. It seems like there is a new wave of documentary films that mix genres of reconstruction and documentary in new ways where it is difficult to know what is what.",

A parody of actor&apos;s lifestyles and film clichés.\n\nTest audiences were not impressed with the film and at the time musicals were out of fashion.\n\nI presume the songs were actually rubbish which tends to be the case with a lot of musical films.\n\nRe-cut and re-edited, this is now a straight story with Nick Nolte, playing Matt Hobbs, a once promising actor who has not managed to get a regular acting gig in some time. He ends up driving around an arrogant film producer (Albert Brooks.)\n\nThings take a turn when his ex-wife dumps their daughter Jeannie on Matt for what he thinks is for a few weeks but turns out to be longer as she is off to jail.\n\nMatt&apos;s daughter is used to getting her own way and he is not used to fatherhood.\n\nMatt&apos;s career may have some brightness as he gets friendly with with an attractive production assistant (Joely Richardson) who has a script idea and thinks Matt could be the lead actor.\n\nThe film was hampered from the start with its production troubles. Nick Nolte does well as a down on his luck actor with a brat of a daughter and trying to bond with her while dealing with machinations of the film industry.\n\nJames L Brooks succeeded so well when he turned his eye on TV news with Broadcast News. The story here is not strong enough and although the actors try hard the film comes off as hollow.",

But it has no fun, doesn&apos;t have what it needs, that is quality &quot;salt and pepper&quot;. The two directors, Castellano (Franco Castellano) and Pipolo (Giuseppe Moccia) they signed together many comedies between &apos;60s - &apos; 90s, some more successful, some less. Personally I have seen some with Adriano Celentano, among the best: &quot;The Taming of the Scoundrel&quot; (1980)Il bisbetico domato(original title), &quot;Madly in Love&quot; (1981)Innamorato pazzo(original title), &quot;Ace&quot; (1981)Asso(original title), the first two also with the beautiful Ornella Muti, who here &quot;plays&quot; herself. So, the three great comedians, Enrico Montesano, Nino Manfredi, Paolo Villaggio, are very good, very funny, in many other films, not here. They try hard but fail to be funny. More funny are Renato Pozzetto and Lino Banfi. The beautiful Laura Antonelli here is no longer the beauty of yesterday, and her role is really ridiculous. Ornella Muti, Heather Parisi, Michele Placido, are just present, in small and insignificant roles. The film is not great fun to watch, it&apos;s only for those who know and love the actors in it.",

I can&apos;t pick a better actress for the part, and the things that pop out of her mouth are unexpected and just plain funny. Yes, there&apos;s a little bit of drama involved, but overall, it&apos;s a comedy like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. And you should watch it as a sort of free-wheeling comedy. Overall, not a bad film. I wouldn&apos;t consider it Bullock&apos;s best, but it&apos;s definitely not her worst either. If you&apos;re looking for a light-hearted, plot packed, rainy day movie to watch, then this is the movie for you. Overall, I give it a C+."

      "reviewBody": "This is a heartfelt, sincere attempt to capture the love story in Spring Snow. It is carefully and respectfully done with high production values and an obvious respect to the source. Yes, the adaptation suffers the usual sins of deviation from the book, including here the astonishing transposition of the deepest irony from its place within the novel to the beginning of the film, thus giving away one of the novel&apos;s most striking, unexpected, and ironic moments which, when revealed, colors so much of the novel.\n\nHowever, this is not my main complaint. It is, rather, that in the novel the love story takes place in and can only be understood in terms of the other cultural aspects of the novel.\n\nIn the film, the love story is abstracted from these other elements. As such, the film becomes a soap. A sincere, well made, perhaps much superior soap, but still, a soap.\n\nThus, you can watch this and come away with: &quot;So what&apos;s the big deal?&quot; Read the amazing book and you&apos;ll know. The love story is even more dramatic, but part of the reason is the much broader context in which it&apos;s occurring that, at best, is only hinted at in the film. Not to mention Mishima&apos;s exquisite description of aspects of the environs in the midst of dramatic events.\n\nStill, Spring Snow, the movie, is superior to much of what passes for drama today.",

      "reviewBody": "BELLARIA is the story of a movie theater that has become a time machine. The film takes its name from a small neighborhood cinema in Vienna that shows old classic (and not so classic) films from the Ufa era to a motley assortment of senior citizens who can remember the days when the German film studio (die Ufa) was a match for Hollywood in every way.\n\nAlthough BELLARIA is technically a German documentary made in Austria by a Swiss-German director, Douglas Wolfsperger has managed to create an atmosphere that has more of the feel of a charming tale than a documentary. His truly unique film offers us a glimpse into the lives of an eccentric group of aging Austrians, parts of Austrian history, and the city of Vienna itself.\n\nWolfsperger opens the film with scenes of the aged moviegoers getting ready to go to the Bellaria, which has become a vital social gathering place for these widows and widowers living otherwise lonely lives with memories of vibrant, more active times. Herr Mosch, the projectionist, is himself one of these lonely folks who enjoy returning to the days of their prime via shimmering black-and-white images on the Bellaria&apos;s screen. He has access to a treasure trove of cans of old Ufa prints that he brings to life each week.\n\nWhen the Bellaria regulars gather for the 4:00 p.m. show to see &quot;unvergessene Filme und unvergessene Stars,&quot; the lobby turns into an old folks home as they sit around having refreshments prior to the screening. When the theater falls into darkness and the screen lights up, we share their experience of being transported to another place and time - not just on the screen, but in their own lives. While it is interesting to enter the black-and-white Ufa world of the 1930s and &apos;40s, we also share in the lost dreams and daily struggles of the audience. All of these people in their 80s and 90s live in the past, some in quite interesting pasts. One says: &quot;I live in the past. I have no future.&quot; But they all know that only the flickering images of their beloved movie stars are truly immortal.\n\nAll of the characters who visit the Bellaria are interesting, but some, particularly the Tenbuss twins, stand out. The Tenbuss sisters have come all the way from Munich to attend a special appearance at the Bellaria by one of the few old Ufa actors (Karl Schönböck) who are still alive. They live to collect autographs and photos of such stars. And to pester them. Watching them in action is both amusing and painful at the same time.\n\nIn the end Wolfsperger leaves his subjects with their proud dignity, even after revealing their foibles, prejudices, and weaknesses. As you laugh, cry and wince, it is hard not to take these oldsters into your heart. You&apos;ll leave the theater just as they do  feeling a little better about life on planet earth.",

To make the task more interesting (not to mention amusing), there is a set of 13 chairs, only one of which holds the cash prize.\n\nAs the two desperately follow the trail of the chairs (each, of course, had already been sold to different buyers), each retrieved chair is immediately &quot;searched&quot; for the stashed money, and each time there is nothing. The considerable expenses of this undertaking are paid by the store owner, while his demands for a share of the eventual profits grow higher.\n\nThe ending may be somewhat predictable, but the &quot;bonus&quot; is an uplifting testimony to the value of friendship and honor. There are things in life money won&apos;t buy.\n\nReminiscent of the legendary Laurel &amp; Hardy films, &quot;13 Stuhle&quot; is made from an old &quot;formula&quot; creating laughter from slapstick and mistaken identity, adding occasional sentimental moments, resulting in a simple delight we can still enjoy on a Sunday afternoon on television...some 70 years later.",

However, Cliff finds a package hidden by one of the gangsters with a rocket with belts and they find that the device allows man to fly. Meanwhile, his beloved girlfriend and aspirant actress Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) succeeds in an audition to make a small part in a movie of the great actor Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) that is ranked the third in box-offices. During a flight exhibition, the mechanic Malcolm (Eddie Jones) has an accident, and Cliff uses the rocket to save him, being called Rocketeer by the public. With his picture in the front page of the newspaper, Cliff is chased by the FBI, the gangsters and German spies that abduct Jenny and forces Cliff to rescue her.\n\n&quot;Rocketeer&quot; is a delightful adventure that recalls those classics from the old times of Hollywood. There is a handsome hero, a gorgeous heroine, gangsters, Nazi spies, betrayals, in a pace of cartoons with a magnificent art decoration, cars and costumes recreating Hollywood in the late 30&apos;s. The story has great lines and uses real characters, like Clark Gable and Howard Hughes, in fictional situations. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Rocketeer&quot;",

His work is brilliant, and makes Spinoza&apos;s film seem like a generic French thriller that pales in comparison. \n\nThis film requires an immense degree of suspended disbelief which makes it unwatchable in my opinion. Am I supposed to believe the events that transpire in the film? Seriously? This film is really far fetched and the lead actress&apos; performance is grating because of its one-dimensiality. Her obsession is just too much. And it cannot carry the film. No one is that obsessed in this world (okay, almost no one), certainly not over a Doctor??? Come on. Get serious.\n\nIf they would have examined her relationship to her mother (like Haneke did in The Piano teacher) in a more thorough manner then it might have helped out in terms of the character development, but these characters just develop in such narrow terms.\n\nI take French Cinema very seriously, but I must admit that this is just average fare. Mediocre at best."

      "reviewBody": "This movie was praised to be hilarious and a parody of all of these Vietnam war movies, so i got a grip on the original DVD and watched it. The hopes were pushed really high by the texts in the advertisements, but as i am familiar with amateur-movie productions i did not take these lines that serious, because most of them are only added to push the marketing. As this is a complete amateur production, i even won&apos;t say its a b-movie. Simply because it does not reach that level.\n\nThe first thing i noticed was that there were scenes taken from other movies and put into this one (the helicopter ones), which you can easily notice on the massive picture quality difference. Second thing i noticed was that the audio and video were about .2 to .3 seconds asynchronous, which i count as a major minus. The rifle shots and explosions are all digitally put in after wards, but they look nice for an amateur movie. I think, they did that because you can&apos;t simply detonate explosives in a German forest without permission. The forest looked pretty good and also the soldiers equipment was well done, so thats a plus.\n\nThe characters in the movie are shallow and fit the usual stereotypes, not even mentioning the acting, which was, in my opinion... brutal to look at. Don&apos;t expect anything from that part. Sometimes its embarrassing how desperately they try to fulfill that stereotypes.\n\nTogether with the fact that i did not have to laugh for a single time during the whole movie (there was not even a grin on my face), because it is simply not funny at all, made me think, how to get back the hour i wasted with this movie.\n\nSo i recommend it only for hardcore trash fans. Everyone else, stay away.",

At these days I was a big fan of epic naval adventures, and that movie easily became one of my favorites. Today, twenty years later, I watched my childhood favorite again. And you know what? It impress me again! I know that many people can say, that there is a lot of historical mistakes in that film. That is true. But also that movie is a great mix of battle epic and drama. There is an outstanding naval battles and truly breathtaking moments, like sinking of ships of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol harbor, by his own sailors.",

      "reviewBody": "Herzog&apos;s &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; is a miraculous documentary. He started by collecting hundreds of hours of video tape shot by the movie&apos;s subject, Timothy Treadwell. The director then culls through the footage and assembles a fascinating portrait of this uniquely bold (and clearly troubled) human being: Treadwell spent 13 summers living amongst grizzly bears in the wilds of Alaska, before being killed by one in the summer of 2003. \n\nTreadwell&apos;s footage is gorgeous, and at times heart-stopping: a grizzly battle caught on tape is the stuff Animal Planet would kill for. But the footage goes beyond simply revealing the harsh yet beautiful reality of the Alaskan wilderness. The camera soon becomes a silent confidant to Treadwell&apos;s self-obsessed confessions. For one, he sees himself as the singular savior of the wildlife preserve he camps at and the creatures that reside there. But he also sees himself becoming increasingly less connected to the real world he lives in 9 months out of the year. The footage here is most poignant, revealing Treadwell&apos;s inner struggles. It paints a picture of a lonely man searching, perhaps desperately, for purpose in a world he feels has rejected him. Most eerily prescient are Treadwell&apos;s repeated remarks about how he would die for the bears, though his eventual death does not appear to be the martyrdom he so clearly sought.\n\nThis is where the film is most riveting - in Treadwell&apos;s footage, focused on the man, the bears, and the force of nature around them. Less compelling are Herzog&apos;s talking head interviews with Treadwell&apos;s friends and family - although they do help to solve (as much as possible) the puzzle of where Timothy came from, what lead him to the bears, and why he was killed.\n\nIt would not be a Herzog film with the director&apos;s own philosophical palette framing the story. Herzog&apos;s commentary reveals his longstanding view that nature is cruel and that chaos is the constant in our life experience, not harmony. That Treadwell saw beauty and soul in the bears seems to be beside the point, since ultimately their need for sustenance made them turn on their self-appointed protector.",

      "reviewBody": "Controversial director Larry Clark&apos;s based on real-life events &quot;Bully&quot; is sometimes quite hard to watch, but you can&apos;t quite stop yourself from watching the misadventures of these messed up children either. This film feels so real, so nitty-gritty, that at times, you may feel like an intruder, watching someone else&apos;s life. These children are so far removed from being children, it is hard to think that they actually are just children. After all, the concept of a group of kids killing their so-called friend, well, its hardly child&apos;s play now is it? The cast are great. Brad Renfro is top-notch in all his performances, here is no exception. Bijou Phillips is great, Rachel Miner is cunning, Kelli Garner is a lot of fun, Michael Pitt is slightly annoying, but entertaining nonetheless. Nick Stahl is intense, to say the least.\n\nOf course it would be hard to say you condone the actions of these &quot;kids&quot;, after all, they murdered. But it makes for gripping drama. The film also reveals the sentencing which the kids received for their parts in the murder, some of which was very surprising. A great film, but you need to be in the mood for a hard-watch.",

And many overrated movies have that formula, which only works because you become so numb as you watch it, that you feel very surprised by the final outcome of the plot, and then believe that it was such a terrific film.\n\nOthers are the exact opposite, meaning that they have a great starting point, but the story gets duller and duller until the final result becomes very predictable. And so many other variations of this genre may arise.\n\nWith `The Unsaid&apos;, however, you can expect to be tied to your seat the whole time as the plot develops. It has a dramatic starting point, a powerful and constant *thrilling* middle section and well, I won&apos;t refer the ending because, believe it, if you start watching this flick, you won&apos;t go away until you see the whole thing. It&apos;s that good! But that&apos;s me, I personally like movies that grab your attention from the start and make you not even take bathroom breaks or answer to your cell-phone calls. What about you?\n\nThe acting by Andy Garcia was brilliant; he really got inside his character. Only with a role like this could he show his true dramatic acting skills, and was followed very well by the rest of the cast. The directing was ok, and had some notorious influence on our understanding and dramatic effect of the scenes. It was done the way it&apos;s supposed to, clean and sober, even in action sequences. I won&apos;t refer to the story or the subjects it&apos;s about, since none of that is necessary here. This is a review, not a `plot outline&apos;.\n\nThe bottom line is this: it&apos;s a definitely worth watching film! And if you&apos;re not entertained during and pleased after it, well. admit it: You watched some movie other than `The Unsaid&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Une étrange affaire&quot; is Pierre Granier-Deferre&apos;s magnum opus,where he goes for broke and proves he can be brilliant.He made another important work at the beginning of the seventies &quot;le chat&quot; but it owed a great deal to its stars Gabin and Signoret.Here,there&apos;s a veteran, Michel Piccoli,and Gérard Lanvin,a generally unambitious actor,finds his best part.But it does not explain everything:the screenplay is very well constructed,the atmosphere stifling and the hero seems to be caught in a giant cobweb.\n\nFirst part depicts the fears of the employees of a department store :a new boss is about to arrive and some skivers are in a cold sweat about it.All rings true,and the whole cast is really excellent.\n\nEnter the new boss,Piccoli,who will not be the one everyone expected:he&apos;s a bon vivant and he treats Gérard ,the hero, as a friend.He takes him to chic places,where the young man feels like a bull in a china shop,he gives him responsibilities and promotion is around the corner.\n\nWhen the future seems brighter than ever ,it&apos;s actually the beginning of the end:his wife ,Nina (a lucid sensitive Natalie Baye) ,has cleverly noticed something was wrong:actually the boss and his beaming but disturbing henchman (Jean-Pierre Kalfon) are making her husband their thing,a slave at their beck and call.They even look into his private life ,and one night,the boss even requisitions the apartment and the couple&apos;s bedroom .&quot;You do not exist anymore&quot; says the wife as tragedy is impending.\n\nThe boss &apos;s method is some kind of professional fascism,which destroys all that makes a man a human being.It&apos;s all the more terrifying as the Master is always friendly,joking,smiling and even fascinating.The conclusion ,which refuses the happy end will give you the jitters.\n\nA strange affair indeed.highly recommended.",

I wouldn&apos;t say the film was terribly original, but what is these days?\n\nThe cast members all did a great job with their respective roles.  I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age, and does quite a good job.  Jason London does a fine job as well.  And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role.  I really liked Sam&apos;s character (Matthew Trant) a lot.  At times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread, but in the end you really like his character.  The rest of the cast was very good as well.\n\nIf you&apos;re into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you, then you ought to watch this film.  I&apos;d suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you&apos;d be interested in, then go for it.  Anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris",

      "reviewBody": "I personally prefer Lalettan&apos;s 1980s and 90s classics but Balettan is a wonderful 🎥 and is my favorite 2000s and 21st Century 🎥 as Lalettan still looks young and the story is very touching. Balachandran is another one of my favorite character names for Lalettan. It&apos;s an interesting comparison as to how Actor Mohanlal is called Lalettan and Lalettan&apos;s name in the 🎥 is Athaniparambil Balachandran known affectionately as Balettan. In other words, Lalettan and Balettan are rhyming nicknames and Actor Lalettan is known as Balettan in the 🎥 which is the namesake title of the 🎥. Lalettan as Balettan is a good samaritan and a 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 hero. However, he has to suffer hardships as his father reveals a burdening secret to him and on top of that, a sinister stranger named Bhadran makes his life miserable and worst of all, his 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 suspects him on having an affair when spotted with his half sister. Balan always goes out of his way to help others but nobody is able to help him when he&apos;s in a time of need. Balan&apos;s father in law is a jerk and is always putting him down. However, this 🎥 ends happy as Balan and the 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 reconcile after learning the truth. My favorite scenes are the Chilu Chilum song and the climax scene where Balan fights Bhadran and defeats him. The endearing part of this 🎥 is where Balan is with his wife Radhika and his two daughters. Fun fact, Lalettan won two Best Actor Awards, the Asianet and Vanitha Film Award and for Best Actor for his performance in this movie. To conclude, Balettan is a legend and always will be for years and generations to come.",

      "reviewBody": "Ignacio (Tati) Benítez (played by himself) is a lumberjack in Argentina&apos;s northern province of Misiones. He has been laid off from his work as an axman and tries to make ends meet searching the forest for branches and roots with peculiar characteristics for a local sculptor, who turns them into carvings that can be sold to tourists.\n\nOne day he unearths a tree root with what looks like an image of soccer legend Diego Armando Maradona (whether the image actually resembles Maradona or not is the subject of many hilarious comments through the movie). Maradona is ill, interned in a Buenos Aires clinic, and Tati, a dyed in the wool Maradona fan, decides to take the root as a gift to the ailing idol. That Tati lacks the money for the trip doesn&apos;t worry him; in fact, he achieves at least part of his objective almost for free through the kindness of various strangers. Whether Maradona receives the root at the end is not clear.\n\nThe Spanish title, El Camino de San Diego sounds almost the same as El Camino de Santiago, the famed pilgrimage route from France through northern Spain to the Galician town of Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of Santiago, James the Apostle are supposed to rest. Like in the Camino de Santiago whether or not Tati&apos;s trip reaches its objective is perhaps not as significant as the quest itself.\n\nWhat makes this movie is Tati&apos;s interaction with people in his town and along the way; his fellow workers, his parish priest, a Brazilian truck driver that takes Tati most of the way (in spite of his partiality to Pelé, Maradona&apos;s Brazilian counterpart), a prostitute that asks Tati&apos;s help to reach Buenos Aires in search of a better career, a blind seller of lottery tickets, the guards and hangers-on in front of Maradona&apos;s country home.\n\nDuring the trip there are glimpses of the Argentine reality of the time; the cult of El Gauchito Gil (one of many local saints/healers not recognized by the Church but venerated by many people), the road cut by piqueteros (people that make their grievances known by stopping traffic), workers that have taken a factory abandoned by its owner, etc. Most of the people we see are poor but always ready to help. As one says, &quot;if we don&apos;t help each other who will?&quot;\n\nCarlos Sorin&apos;s movies are often minimalist, dealing with ordinary people and everyday situations and using nonprofessional actors. Sorin&apos;s direction and script for this movie are flawless; he shows people interacting with warmth, goodness and humor without falling into sentimentality. On the way, he manages to show unobtrusively snatches of the physical and spiritual landscape where his characters move. A superior film.",

Justus von Dohnanyi&apos;s script is particularly generous with jobless Willi (Stefan Kurt), a bothersome outcast held together by nothing but quirks and issues. He&apos;s fun to watch, but you can&apos;t help feeling relieved he doesn&apos;t live next door. Although Willi, Achim (Jan-Josef Liefers) and Sven (Justus von Dohnanyi) aren&apos;t the most manly males, &quot;Bis zum Ellenbogen&quot; suffers from a slight overdose of testosterone. I wish we had seen a little more of Susanne Wolff in the part of Rebecca, Achim&apos;s headstrong wife. Notable guest appearances by Antoine Monot Jr. (of &quot;Lammbock&quot; fame) as the village oaf and Devid Striesow, who clearly enjoys his small part as a heartless banker and dreadful dad.",

They are screaming and are really afraid by seeing that. \n\nNot only that but all the effects were done with CGI. And it annoyed me a lot. When the children attack and bite nothing is seen, not even a bite or some red stuff. If you don&apos;t show blood be sure that it is scary like Halloween did. And the acting was mediocre too, nobody could convince me. The most creepy part were the boobs of Kim (Bjanka Murgel), will they drop out of her bra yes or no. \n\nA waste of time for me, hope it will be hidden soon in a trash can.\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Story 1/5 Effects 0/5 Comedy 0/5",

Even in comparison with the over-the-top Film Horror it just doesn&apos;t have any redeeming features. Joke are laughable and not in a good sense. People running into trees and cheesy acting isn&apos;t enough to make you laugh.\n\nThe epigon of crappiness are all the &apos;boing&apos; noises... Watchable, but what for?",

(except for Christmas vacation 2).\n\nI did find the first part of the movie very entertaining, but I somehow got lost in the sudden change of the story, where the Johnson family Finally makes it to the reunion, and has to turn around and leave. Although, the fact that it was one wrong turn after another, and a story of a family coming together, I must give it some credit for sticking to some of the original &quot;vacation&quot; movie.

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s always interesting to see how the art of cinema... a form of expression which much too often suffers under an audience and financial backers who demand simple entertainment, easily taken in and processed... deals with topics that are more complex and intricate than can be explained to the common movie-goer in a limited space of time, that being between an hour and a half and about three hours(in recent years, there has been a return of the longer running times... for better or for worse, and with ranging success). Psycho-analysis was also dealt with by the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock... in Spellbound, in 1945. He, as Huston does here, gave it a fair treatment, though oversimplifying it some. What&apos;s interesting is that Huston, while his film seems to be the lesser known, is actually the better representation of the subject(though, mind you, not necessarily the better film). This deals with Freud and his discoveries, following him for half a decade, giving what may be a fairly accurate account of his first work with hypnosis and psycho-analysis. We see a few of his patients, and the film focuses on him as he works on one particular patient... whose symptoms strongly resemble some he, to a (considerably) lesser degree has himself, and we experience how he develops and presents(and is met with strong protest and outrage, as he indeed was in real life) one theory which would become a cornerstone of his psychological writings and his view on man. I will not reveal what it is here, but anyone should know what he believed before watching this, since it is a rather provocative idea(and it is somewhat glorified in this film... Freud comes across as more of a misunderstood genius than the hopeful man(who did yield some important and interesting discoveries) that he was in real life). The cinematic values of the film are fine... the pace could have been more consistent(it should be noted that I watched a cut that was 120 minutes, not 139, long), and there are one or two scenes which seem obsolete, but there&apos;s little else that stands out, neither positively nor negatively. The film&apos;s score is dramatic, but that is not uncommon for a movie of that period. There are several nice touches in the film, in regards to who it is about... among them the Freudian slip in a scene with a patient. I recommend this to anyone interested in psychology, regardless of their view on Freud... it&apos;s interesting to watch, and fairly nicely done, to boot. Just keep in mind that it&apos;s neither a documentary nor a proper biographical film. 7/10",

Some might point a finger at the catchy number of Hans Sommer &apos;Yes, gentlemen, the world belongs to us&apos; but that is open to interpretation and is ironically prophetic only in retrospect. This film apparently landed UFA in all sorts of trouble with the executors of the Conan Doyle Estate but the court eventually found in UFA&apos;s favour after years of legal wrangling.\n\nHans Albers as Morris Flynn and Heinz Ruemann as Macky McPherson bounce off each other wonderfully and they are ably supported by Marieluise Claudius who died tragically at the age of 29 and Hansi Knoteck who went on until the age of 98. Fascinating also is Hilde Weissner whose film appearances were rare, playing a crook. The final courtroom scene is magnfiicent, climaxing in the identity of the &apos;laughing man&apos; being revealed.\n\nThe careers of both Albers and Ruemann continued unabated after the war and Ruemann&apos;s popularity survived his perceived chumminess with Hitler.\n\nKarl Hartl who had worked twice before with Albers on more weighty material never allows the tempo to slacken and delivers a gloriously entertaining film. Zehn von Zehn!",

If I&apos;m surfing the remote and &quot;hit&quot; the movie that I just can leave, then that&apos;s it. I did this last night and  when I hit &quot;Inside Moves&quot;. This is a extremely comfortable and beautifully paced film . The scenes in Max&apos;s are so warm and intimate you feel if your in the corner of the bar observing the intimate relationships and comaraderie of the supposedly &quot;special &quot; people that live there. Yes, they are special..they&apos;re only aspirations are enjoying each other&apos;s company and accepting each other and their metamorphical handicaps. The scene where Louise admits she is frightened by a potential romantic realtionship with Rory is honest and heartbreaking. After checking the credits on Inside Moves I was surprised and then nodding in agreement, why it&apos;s a classic. Written by Barry Levinson...enough said.."

I was excited to hear that so many people were supporting this movie on its opening weekend. It&apos;s message will hit close to home with so many people. With the high divorce rate these days, I agree that all people should view this movie. I&apos;m not married myself, but it touched me so much because I saw in it the relationship my parent&apos;s have had for years. And while it focuses on the husband changing his ways in order to win back his wife, it also touches on wives changing their ways to win back their husbands. There may be many stereotypes shown in this movie, but that comes with movies trying to touch the world. Without stereotypes, we might not understand it so well.\n\nOverall ratings: Plot - 10, Cinematography - 9, Acting - 6 (due to using only one professional actor, kudos to the church members for holding their own)",

      "reviewBody": "Lost in Translation details the kind of wayward search for human connection many of us go through in life, sometimes young, sometimes old, or following a traumatic event. It&apos;s the time in our lives when we feel the most lost, and truthfully, many of us don&apos;t want answers as to how to better our situation, but just want somebody to go along for the ride. We&apos;d like to find someone to empathize with, embrace on a frequent basis, and know that somebody cares about us and our wayward ways and to reciprocate such feelings.\n\nWith this, Sofia Coppola writes and directs a film about that search for human connection and what it can exactly amount to. We are immediately introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an older American movie star who travels to Tokyo to film an advertisement for Suntory whiskey. Bob has found himself in the mix of a souring marriage and no real close friends, and it is in Tokyo where Bob sinks deeper and deeper into a midlife crisis. Meanwhile, we also meet Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a college graduate whose husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) is starting to lose interest in her in favor of all the models he works with.\n\nLater on, Bob and Charlotte finally meet and immediately recognize each others unfortunate situation. They spend sporadic amounts of time together, often not talking and simply speaking in fragmented sentences and lying next to one another. They aren&apos;t very concerned with long conversation; they simply let their lethargy in their current situations carry their relationship along.\n\nOver time, sexual tension between the two builds, though both of them are still caught in relationships, regardless of how mediocre they are. In addition, neither of them are quite sure how to conjure intimacy with one another. The two are much more in tune with being static beings and platonic. This is one of the few dramas I can recall that allows the presence of the characters to take over rather than their actions. Coppola sits back and watches with a keen eye and a sense of mannered restraint how Bob and Charlotte get close over the course of their visit in Tokyo.\n\nCoppola&apos;s interest lies in Bob and Charlotte&apos;s situation moreso than the progression of their relationship, which is a difficult thing to pull off in film without working with more of an impressionistic style. The brushstrokes Coppola paints this story in are more or less minimal, but they craft just enough out of a little so that we can recognize these characters, their feelings, and their current state. They have transcended living life into simply existing within it, rarely getting excited and scarcely finding any kind of mutual contentment.\n\nAgain, in these situations, all you need is another soul who feels the same way you do, and in this case, that&apos;s bottled up angst and complete and total uncertainty. The title represents a lot of things and the cultural gap Bob and Charlotte experience is only a small part of it; these two souls are lost within the translation of life. Life has keep going and two formerly active people who could keep up with the bustle have let it all pass by, letting sadness dominate their lives and fogginess encapsulate the remnants of the future. The translation lost is within the characters here, and that&apos;s sometimes scarier than not speaking the same language of the community.\n\nThe only issue that arises from this is that we get the impression that Coppola either doesn&apos;t understand Japanese culture or simply doesn&apos;t want to, what with the abundance of cheap stereotypes and archetypal Japanese characters played for nothing but laughs here. Coppola opens by ostensibly getting most out of her way, thankfully, however, through the use of subtle humor, but sporadically doubles back to throw in another jab or two, which can briefly throw the film out of whack. It reminds me of when a really artsy film wants to try and pander and connect with the audience when it thinks it has lot them, and, as shown here amidst others, the action has the opposite effect.\n\nHowever, Murray and Johansson craft wonderful, low-key chemistry here. Murray&apos;s subtle sarcasm and overall cynicism are downplayed but in force here, as he employs facial expressions that speak louder than words could. He fully shows how he can be a hilarious comic presence and a fascinating, real dramatic presence and merge the two in one project, proving nothing but great range and ability on his behalf. Johansson, who was only eighteen during the time this was being filmed, bears mannerisms and a self-assured aura that would be more expected from someone ten years older than her. Such lofty material is presented and she handles the task of not being too theatrical or obvious very well, and it&apos;s a performance that requires both actors to place a reliance on their body language and facial expressions. This was by no means an easy role for Johansson, yet she breaks out with it and becomes a force all her own.\n\nLost in Translation details a difficult time in a person&apos;s life and, in the process, doesn&apos;t sugarcoat it. The lack of human connection and the feelings of hopelessness, regardless of short-term or long-term, are debilitating to a person, and this film goes on to show to reiterate my idea about life: if we didn&apos;t have at least one of these things - a passion, a good relationship with family, or close friends and people to connect with - we would jump out a window.\n\nStarring: Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanna Ribisi, and Anna Faris. Directed by: Sofia Coppola.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is one of the first Argentinian horror films, and was the highest grossing film in the history of Argentina, up until El Secreto De Sus Ojos was released in 2009.\n\nIt was directed by cultural icon Leonardo Favio, and was the break out role for television actor Juan José Camero, who plays Nazareno Cruz- the seventh son of a family living in Argentina.\n\nThe story is based on the Guaraní myth of the Lobison- a werewolf-like creature, from South America, that lurks within the mind and body of the accursed seventh son.\n\nBy the time he reaches adolescence...Nazareno is already the most popular boy in his village.\n\nAnd he has fallen in love with the most beautiful girl in town.\n\nAs the story goes, though, the seventh son is always born with a curse...the curse of the werewolf...which will see him transform into a wolf, upon the rising of the full moon...so that he can feast on human blood.\n\nHowever, this metamorphosis is not initiated until he finds true love.\n\nSo, now that he has found the love of his life, he is approached by the Devil...who gives him an ultimatum: choose love or give it up in exchange for a vast amount of wealth, power, and influence.\n\nNazareno chooses love over riches.\n\nBut...he probably should have realized that any deal with the Devil is libel to be a ruse.\n\nBecause things don&apos;t pan out like he expects them too.\n\nThe girls father finds him fooling around with his daughter, and- feeling he has tainted her innocence and purity- decides to punish Nazareno for his lustful transgressions.\n\nFortunately for Nazareno, this incident just so happens to coincide with the rise of the full moon...and so he transforms into a wolf.\n\nThis isn&apos;t some epic special effects transformation, or anything, though...it&apos;s basically the actor falling down on all fours, before they cut to a shot of a real wolf...which is subsequently subject to a series of actual dogfights in the film.\n\nWhich, I&apos;m not going to lie...is a bit anti-climactic, for a film that is otherwise a beautifully shot, mildly arthouse offering.\n\nThe whole thing is effectively a tragic love story.\n\nOne that combines elements of Beauty &amp; The Beast with Romeo &amp; Juliet and a traditional indigenous werewolf tale.\n\nBut it might not be for everyone...because it&apos;s a bit slow paced, and arthousey.\n\nThe best part of this film is definitely it&apos;s cinematography and framing...which is really quite beautifully done.\n\nThe only thing is, there just isn&apos;t enough special effects- or arthouse complexity- to make it stand out from the rest of the crowd, and keep you fully engaged.\n\nBut it&apos;s not a bad film, by any means.\n\nWhere the execution might be lacking a bit, the story gives it a solid base...and the end result is certainly palatable.\n\nThose expecting an action packed werewolf slaughterfest are sure to leave disappointed.\n\nWhereas, those open to a more contemplative arthouse style might appreciate the picture a little more.\n\nAforementioned considerations aside, once the story has played itself out...it&apos;s kind of a middle of the road werewolf tale...which could be taken as a hit or miss, depending on what you personally appreciate and go in expecting.\n\nI enjoyed it...but don&apos;t go in expecting to get blown away, or anything.\n\nBecause it&apos;s just not that type of film.\n\n6 out of 10.",

Together with some excellent actors, strong dialects (it takes place in East Jutland, however there are many different dialects) and wonderful characters (all of the actors are excellent), this for me gives the film a quirky charm and personality. Compared to Karl Stegger (1972) and Henrik Malberg (1931) in &quot;Præsten i Vejlby&quot;, Poul Reumert is here more jovial and perhaps naive\n\nThe dialects can, I think, be a little difficult to understand, but this doesn&apos;t change my overall impression of a highly charming look into the old days.",

      "reviewBody": "Doris Day was among Hollywood&apos;s few truly bankable stars during the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly noted for her comic talents in such frothy farces as PILLOW TALK, PLEASE DON&apos;T EAT THE DAISIES, and THAT TOUCH OF MINK. Unfortunately, as the 1960s progressed her films did not, and although her films remained popular they were seen as increasingly out of touch with the tone of the times. The situation was not helped by Day&apos;s husband-manager Martin Melcher, who developed the habit of signing Day to film projects Day herself found uninspired. Such was the case with the 1965 flyweight comedy DO NOT DISTURB.\n\nThe play seems to be a grab-bag of ideas from previous Day films, the story of a pretty but slightly klutzy wife (Day) and a neglectful husband (Rod Taylor) who find themselves at romantic cross purposes courtesy of their landlady Vanessa (Hermione Baddeley), a sexy secretary (Maura McGiveney), and a handsome antiques dealer(Sergio Fantoni.) The roles are one-dimensional, the plot turns are predictable, and the dialogue trivial. Both Day and Taylor respond by overplaying, sometimes to the point of shrillness. Even so, they do manage to inject enough life into the film to make it mildly amusing--and the supporting cast is quite charming. When all is said and done, the film is most memorable for the sight of Doris Day in a brilliantly orange evening gown as she struggles on the dance floor to shake away an olive dropped down her back.\n\nThe DVD includes several bonus features, including an account of Day&apos;s early life and career, a brief biography of Michael Romanoff (who plays a cameo in the film), and a brief biography of composer Mort Garson (who is perhaps best remembered for the song &quot;Our Day Will Come.) It offers a nice transfer and is present in its original widescreen format. Most Doris Day fans will find it amusing, but even so most will admit that DO NOT DISTURB is hardly among the first tier of her films: not bad, but in no way memorable.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer",

      "reviewBody": "From `Goodbye Mr. Chips&apos; in the 1930&apos;s to `Dead Poet&apos;s Society&apos; in the 1980&apos;s, the movies have had a long-running love affair with inspirational, sentimental stories set at ivy-covered, collegiate-gothic, all-male prep schools.  These films inevitably center around a beloved teacher and the lifelong bond he forges with his devoted students.  \n\nThe latest addition to the genre  a successful one  is `The Emperor&apos;s Club,&apos; with Kevin Kline assuming the role of the teacher who considers it his duty not only to instruct his students in the details of classical history but to mold them into men of integrity and character in the process. `The Emperor&apos;s Club&apos; follows the standard formula up to a point.  William Hundert is the most highly respected faculty member at St. Benedict&apos;s Academy.  He is able to bring the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans to vivid life for his admittedly highly motivated young charges.  Then, one day, into his classroom strides Sedgwick Bell, a bright, highly unmotivated student who would rather mock the stuffiness of education and inspire his buddies to feats of rabblerousing than devote his life to the serious pursuit of academia.  It, thus, becomes Hundert&apos;s job to turn Sedgwick around, a feat that always seems much easier to accomplish in the movies than it ever is in real life.\n\n`The Emperor&apos;s Club,&apos; after its rather conventional beginning, deviates from its predecessors in one key respect:  Hundert, though a man of values and integrity, is not above compromise himself, and he winds up making a very serious one, the ramifications of which he has to live with for many years to come.  Rather than showing him as some sort of saintly figure, screenwriter Neil Tolkin (working from a short story by Ethan Canin) and director Michael Hoffman allow Hundert&apos;s humanity to shine through.  He is a flawed individual who permits personal feelings to cloud his judgments and who is willing, once he has created a problem, to allow the truth of his own guilt to remain hidden even when innocent victims suffer as a result of his actions.  `The Emperor&apos;s Club&apos; is also notable for its clear-eyed recognition that not all situations in life need have a satisfying resolution, that some people simply do not acknowledge their own failings and, therefore, never develop into morally superior people no matter how many experiences life throws at them.  Yet, what breaks Hundert&apos;s heart is the recognition he comes to that such a person is often times more highly rewarded by the world than the man who follows along the straight-and-narrow path all his life.\n\nKline gives a superb performance as Hundert, capturing the quiet dignity, understated passion and conflicted conscience of a man who loves his boys and who tries to do the right thing but who, like the rest of us, doesn&apos;t always succeed in doing so.  Emile Hirsch is also excellent as young Sedgwick, the boy whose need for attention and lack of moral guidance from his father lead him to accept the winning-at-all-cost philosophy to get him through life.\n\n`The Emperor&apos;s Club,&apos; despite having its roots firmly planted in a grand storytelling tradition, still manages to take us into new territory from time to time  and its recognition of the importance of education and academics (we actually get to learn a little about Roman history while watching the movie) makes it virtually unique among films of its time."

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a type of &quot;what if&quot; scenario and the makers of the short went with the &quot;what if the creature from John Carpenter&apos;s 1982 movie &quot;The Thing&quot; existed in the Resident Evil franchise&quot;, so this is basically what the animated short movie actually represents by the looks of it. To be honest: i&apos;m glad that it&apos;s not considered a canon, because it would probably hurt the franchise a lot and after seeing what the Executer Virus really does in the short movie - it&apos;s impossible for me to imagine where the franchise will go if they used that idea for future installments.\n\nThe biggest problem that i had with the short was the animation. It&apos;s so terrible, even for the time it was released looks horrendous. There are animated movies that were released before Biohazard 4D: Executer like Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and A Bug&apos;s Life that looked way better, even those that are starting to show their age and the old Resident Evil games (like Resident Evil 2, 3: Nemesis and Code: Veronica) that have great CG cutscenes that to this day i&apos;m still impressed by them.\n\nI was surprised that it doesn&apos;t shy away by showing some crazy gore and disturbing imagery and i&apos;m certain that everyone will enjoy them very much. It had some cool moments and some of the aspects like the shot composition, the editing and the sound are very well done, which made it a enjoyable experience, but the story, characters, dialogue, acting and the music makes it a very flawed short. Even though it&apos;s very flawed, i guarantee that i&apos;ll watch it again and again in the near future.",

      "reviewBody": "One last collaboration for John Hughes and Molly Ringwald, whose creative partnership dissolved after this film. Somewhat softer and more self-serious than the preceding teen epics Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, it tackles social cliques and classism from various perspectives. Ringwald and leading man Andrew McCarthy, akin to Romeo and Juliet, find their young relationship stressed by the negative influence of friends who insist they find someone closer to their own status. There really isn&apos;t much sparkle to the pairing, though, apart from a few awkward make-out scenes, and they both come off as especially wet noodles in comparison to the vibrant, brash supporting cast. Jon Cryer is most memorable of these as Duckie, a flamboyant mod who&apos;s been carrying a torch for Ringwald all his life, and nearly steals the film with an abrupt dance/lip-sync number just before everything gets overly angsty. Most of the third act is wasted on hand-wringing and moping, though, and the ending (changed at the last minute, much to Hughes&apos;s chagrin) feels disingenuous even if it does make a better fit for the movie&apos;s theme. The window dressings are drowned in &apos;80s flavor, too, from the appropriately synthy soundtrack to the Halloween-grade costume choices. Looks like everyone at this school was either Don Johnson, Sid Vicious or Morrissey.",

      "reviewBody": "Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel &apos;&apos;fanboy&apos;&apos; or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.\n\nThat being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.\n\nSo starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I&apos;m sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It&apos;s not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won&apos;t say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn&apos;t am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.\n\nSo as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.",

      "reviewBody": "Is BEYOND THE FOREST an overripe and over-the-top potboiler or a potent, underrated film noir? Both, actually, with an emphasis on the latter. This is film noir&apos;s MADAME BOVARY wherein a provincial housewife&apos;s romantic fantasies and big city dreams bring tragedy to everyone in her orbit and it&apos;s the &quot;twisted sister&quot; of Vincente Minnelli&apos;s ode to Flaubert&apos;s driven, deluded anti-heroine, released the same year. Nineteen forty-nine was the year of the desperate housewife in Hollywood- in addition to Bette Davis &amp; Jennifer Jones, there&apos;s also Audrey Totter in TENSION and Lizabeth Scott in TOO LATE FOR TEARS, postwar noir women who &quot;expect and demand a better life and plan to achieve it by any means necessary&quot;. \n\nForty year-old Bette Davis &quot;with her low-cut peasant blouses, long black wig, and carmine lips&quot; is unquestionably miscast but, like the film itself, that actually works in a perverted sort of way. If Virginia Mayo had been cast (Davis actually lobbied for her), it would have begged the question, &quot;why doesn&apos;t this beautiful girl just hop a bus to New York or Hollywood or something?&quot; but with a not-so-young-anymore Rosa -out of options and rapidly running out of time- there&apos;s a palpable sense of entrapment as the irrational resentments that have simmered for far too long are ready to erupt. Still, the movie also has its amusing aspects and you can&apos;t help but smile as Rosa sashays down the street and all the men stop and stare. How could a past-her-prime, dimestore siren like that keep Joseph Cotten and David Brian in such thrall? Why, sex of course. Rosa no doubt did things in bed they couldn&apos;t get enough of, much like the hold Wallis Simpson had over the Duke of Windsor. The crime of Rosa Moline was similar to that of Phyllis Hochen in THE UNHOLY WIFE (desperate for a way out, she ends up shooting her husband&apos;s best friend) and from the overblown opening prologue scroll to the mounting hysteria and rampant symbols of Hell that culminate in a &quot;shocking conclusion&quot;, Vidor&apos;s &quot;Bovary&quot; casts a spell as well. Written off as a &quot;camp classic&quot; for years, BEYOND THE FOREST has been reassessed of late:\n\nBette Davis tires of life married to a small-town doctor, so she takes off to Chicago for an affair, hopping the most monstrously phallic train in film history. Her frenzied performance is met on the other side of the camera by director King Vidor, who matches her excesses shot for shot. The &quot;What a dump!&quot; line quoted in WHO&apos;S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? originates here, though it&apos;s actually one of the film&apos;s more naturalistic moments. Much of Vidor&apos;s late work flirts dangerously with camp; this 1949 effort, I&apos;m afraid, frequently succumbs, though it has a weird kind of power and integrity. With Joseph Cotten and David Brian. -Dave Kehr \n\nBEYOND THE FOREST, with its main character&apos;s dissatisfaction with small- town middle-class morality, its big-city expressionistic mise-en-scène, and Davis, with the most extreme portrayal of a malignant bitch of the forties, we have a work that is firmly rooted in the tradition of film noir...this paean to amour fou is one of the most operatic of all films noirs -at once both moralistic and obdurate, grandly emotive, overbearing, and magnificent. -The American Film Noir \n\nA TV perennial back in the day, legal hassles prevent King VIdor&apos;s unsung noir from being shown today. As of this writing, it&apos;s not in the Warner Archives and TCM hasn&apos;t aired it in well over a decade. That&apos;s a shame.",

Catapult, the boss of the bad guys, is easy to find because he loves fireworks. Amen gets hired as a new band member, robs a bank together with the bandits, but Catapult still doesn&apos;t trust the new guy...\n\nIn 1976, the big wave of Italian westerns came to and end, and this is one of the last tired attempts to keep it going - a comedy that is never particularly funny. Director Bianchi left the genre and continued with X rated flicks. This gives you an idea of the budget and camera work which was used already here.",

What we get from Dracula&apos;s Curse is once again lots of fancy gunplay, swordfighting and martial arts involving hot goth chicks, which seems to have become the rule for vampire films these days (Blade, Underworld, Van Helsing etc. etc.) The cast perform adequately, but there&apos;s nothing much for them to do except strike poses looking cool or angry. The fights are choreographed okay and there&apos;s no poorly done CGI to laugh at, but we have seen this sort of thing before and I expect better from The Asylum.",

But the makers of the movie have stumbled onto a comedic truth that never fails: take an aberrant character trait, and take it to the absolute limit. The lead character is a mailman of monstrously incompetent proportions, a creepy, irredemiably snoopy individual who can&apos;t even get mugged right; he would gladly have handed over his mailbag, but he couldn&apos;t get it off his shoulder. In the process of sneaking around a deaf girl&apos;s apartment whom he fancies, he saves her life after she tries to commit suicide. For this guy, this uncharacteristically unselfish act sets off a disastrous chain of events. This weird movie will NOT work for you if you don&apos;t think it&apos;s funny. And this movie will only be funny for you to the degree that you&apos;re cynical and capricious in your affections. People of good heart, stay away.",

The big recruiting effort is tailback Darnell Jefferson (Omar Epps) and they use female student Autumn Haley (Halle Berry) as the lure. Once in school, he finds that she already has a boyfriend who is the starting tailback. Alvin Mack promises to buy his mother a house counting on signing an NFL contract. Andrew Bryniarski is the muscle-bound lineman found using steroids and attacking a girl.\n\nThis seems like a greatest hit of college football scandals. The scattered approach leaves this problematic. I don&apos;t have a big problem with any of the stories but none of them really takes the lead. Sheffer isn&apos;t compelling enough to be the star. Omar Epps comes close to be star material and it would be interesting to have him as the lead character. There are just too many main story material.",

      "reviewBody": "Ingrid Bergman oddly receives top billing in her last Swedish film, Only One Night before going Hollywood to reprise her role in Intermezzo which she did in her homeland 3 years earlier. Clearly the third lead her natural beauty takes a back seat to no one.\n\nCarny manager, Valdemar (Edvin Adolphson) is a persuasive charmer easy on the eyes of the ladies. A charismatic upbeat fellow he finds out he is the out of wedlock son of a nobleman through farfetched coincidence. The upper crust old man (Olof Sandborg) sets out to convert Waldemar to a life of gentry as well as hook him up with his refined ward played by Bergman in order to extend the breed and name. The conversion however does not go smoothly.\n\nAdolphson plays Waldemar the boundless charmer true to himself with a vivacious devil may care attitude, knowing the hardbitten existence of the carnival circuit suits him better than being lord of the manor. Bergman is more of a paradox, asexual but willing to sacrifice. She is certainly a character that bears a lot of scrutiny and Ingrid, though difficult to define is solid from end to end. Aino Taub as Wal&apos;s carnival squeeze brings excellent contrast to Bergman&apos;s character.\n\nBergman influencer director Molander seems to be attempting to convey a stay in your own lane attitude in this veiled class war that sometimes overloads scenes with superfluous dialogue making it move slowly in spots but forces you to linger to see where our leads are headed as Molander keeps matters nebulous until film&apos;s climax.",

      "reviewBody": "THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE (1936) is a landmark color film of considerable dramatic power that has been neglected in Hollywood history. It was the second full-length feature to be produced in the newly-developed 3 strip Technicolor process. The first Technicolor feature, BECKY SHARP, had opened the previous year (1935) but did not find audience favor. There is strong evidence to suggest that THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE was the film that really popularized color.\n\nAside from the superb color photography, the film has much to recommend it. There are very strong performances, particularly that of Sylvia Sidney as the backwoods mountain girl - a very convincing portrayal. She is supported by two handsome newcomers, Henry Fonda and Fred MacMurray, plus veterans such as Fred Stone, Beulah Bondi, and Spanky MacFarland. The story line is very compelling and there is the strong direction of Henry Hathaway (LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER, KISS OF DEATH, TRUE GRIT). In its original release, audiences reportedly burst into applause while viewing some of the color scenes. The film was a box office smash for Paramount, playing to packed houses in both large and small towns. (This is well documented.) It remains compelling entertainment today. The high-quality color photography was very much in evidence in the VHS tape that MCA released in the Nineties. It is to be hoped that the same high quality will be seen in the projected 2009 DVD release of this beloved film.",

      "reviewBody": "Visionary director Werner Herzog has explored innumerable landscapes throughout his career, from the wilds of Africa to the jungles of South America and the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. His latest project &apos;Enigma Of Loch Ness&apos; takes him to the Scottish Highlands, where he plans to examine the myth of the Loch Ness Monster. Alongside him, a documentary crew- led by intrepid producer Zak Penn- film the proceedings as &apos;Enigma&apos; goes into production. Though Herzog steadfastly disbelieves in the legend of Nessie, it seems that under the waters of the Loch something is stirring; something which may doom both productions to the cinematic shallows.\n\n&apos;Incident at Loch Ness&apos; is a funny mockumentary that satirizes the documentary format, as well as the public persona of the great Werner Herzog. Zak Penn&apos;s directorial debut, the film humorously portrays the notion of cinéma vérité as a Sisyphean ideal, also showing how the sensationalist machinations of producers and moneymen can hamper the filmmaking process. Though occasionally the jokes feel a tad on the nose and the narrative loses some impetus in the latter half; the comedy comes fast and frequent, and will assuredly have you laughing throughout.\n\nAs will the caricature the film offers of Werner Herzog. Playing into and sending up his reputation as a profound, determined, borderline obsessive eccentric, the film&apos;s version of the director is not an over-the-top creation; more of a slyly, wryly heightened one (obviously written by someone with great admiration and affection for the man). Herzog&apos;s performance as himself is a masterclass in understated comedy. He exaggerates his mannerisms and style of speech subtly, never once verging into the overblown. The antics the film&apos;s Herzog engage in are madcap at times, but always played completely straight and in keeping with his established character, and his dialogue is consistently comical. It is a delight to see Herzog play such an amusing version of himself, and you&apos;ll surely remember his performance fondly.\n\nLess impressive are the supporting characters, both in terms of writing and performance. While the central figure of Herzog is amusing, the ostensible co-star of &apos;Incident at Loch Ness&apos; Zak Penn is considerably less so. His caricature as a desperate producer insistent on cliches and sensationalist tactics is a one-note, irritating creation, and Penn&apos;s performance as same is mediocre at best. The other characters are underwritten, so that talents like Russell Williams II and Gabriel Beristain are left with relatively little to do.\n\nOn the technical side, the film easily impresses. Like the best mockumentaries, such as &apos;This Is Spinal Tap&apos; or &apos;Bob Roberts,&apos; &apos;Incident at Loch Ness&apos; doesn&apos;t overdo the technical conventions of documentary features, such as adding unnecessarily shaky cameras or grainy footage in an attempt to give the film a look grounded in realism. Instead, John Bailey&apos;s cinematography is reserved, professional and muted; in keeping with the actual style and look of documentaries. Abby Schwarzwalder and Howard E. Smith&apos;s editing must also be mentioned, as their consummate work adds to the effectiveness of the film&apos;s masquerade as truth.\n\nThough it is not in the same league as &apos;This Is Spinal Tap,&apos; &apos;Incident at Loch Ness&apos; is a funny mockumentary centered around a cinematic giant that is easy to watch and enjoy. Featuring a great self-parodying performance from Werner Herzog and an assured visual style, the film has plenty to boast about; though it also has its&apos; detractions. The supporting cast aren&apos;t particularly impressive and the narrative and its&apos; characters are unevenly written. However, it&apos;s got plenty of moments that&apos;ll have you laughing, and for any fan of Herzog, it&apos;s a must watch. In short, &apos;Incident at Loch Ness&apos; is something of a mixed bag; but one with treasures a-plenty for the discerning viewer.",

      "reviewBody": "I rate this high because the script builds some real suspense. As is the case with most of these, the villain is a really bad guy--psychotic to the nth degree. There seems to be an orchestrated effort to push Wallander to the edge. A series of event are directed at the daughters of cops. We are made aware that Kurt is under surveillance by some evil entity. Things are moved around in his apartment. He is called to crimes which prove to be falsehoods or distractions. His own people begin to doubt his stability. Linda is out to prove something, to outdo others, and she gets quite reckless. Another young woman is kidnapped, her bedroom splashed with blood. The key has to do with a connection among all of these. The downside is one that is recognized by other reviewers. The sloppy, careless, haphazard work of the police. In so many episodes, a little care and common sense would have prevented a great deal of anguish. Yes, there would have been less suspense, but with the right effort, this still could have been accomplished. Once is continually saying, &quot;Are you serious?&quot;",

The cutting of the movie looked like the guy who did it, got drunk, fell asleep, and then when he woke up just cut the whole film into random strips and taped it together again. Besides I really never figured out what Dennis Hopper&apos;s character was named. I think I counted at least 4 different names. Last a sudden sunrise really nailed my feeling towards the whole movie, it sucked! All in all I would say the only good thing about this movie is that it only wasted 95 min of my life.",

What a great study in murder, infidelity, cruelty, sex, and relationships between strangers. A kind of film noir with dark overtones and a slow but effective suspense, the story starts as a simple investigation about a runaway teenager, but grows more and more into a complex drama plenty of unexpected twists. Gene Hackman is superb as the rude detective, the rest of the cast is also in fine form, but the real shock is to see a very young, hot (and naked) Melanie Grifith doing a terrific performance. James Woods is also here, with less impact but great to see too. An excellent film, one of the finest 70&apos;s underrated movies."

However, I really, really lost a lot of respect for him when I watched this show. I know bad science when I see it. Here in &quot;Nefertiti Revealed&quot; I felt as if I&apos;d been taken in by a patent medicine show! Again and again, the show was advertised ahead of time as having all-new and earth-shattering discoveries about the famed queen Nefertiti. Instead, however, I saw Hawass say things like &apos;might have been&apos;, &apos;could be&apos; and the like as he talked about some mummy that COULD have been Nefertiti. And what support did he give for all this? Not much--just lots of supposition. I felt I truly had wasted my time and wondered if his motives had anything to do with advancing knowledge or just a chance to get himself on TV. After seeing him in several other shows since then, I have now learned to be a skeptic where his work is concerned.\n\nI&apos;d sure love to sit down and watch this again with an Egyptologist to see what they think...",

      "reviewBody": "8213: Gacy House (2010) \n\n1/2 (out of 4) \n\nAnother &quot;found footage&quot; film from The Asylum has six paranormal researchers going into the home of John Wayne Gacy and never being seen again. The police find their video footage and us unlucky viewers must sit through it. Some would say that The Asylum should quit making movies all together but I won&apos;t go that far as I find some of their &quot;mockbusters&quot; to be entertaining. Their found footage films, on the other hand, are a complete disaster most of the time and these I do wish they&apos;d quit making. 8213: GACY HOUSE isn&apos;t quite as awful as THE AMITYVILLE HAUNTING but that&apos;s certainly not an endorsement of this film. I think talented people can use this genre to really build up some atmosphere and deliver some scares but whenever you got some ultra cheap production like this that&apos;s main goal is to make money, the artistic level usually isn&apos;t on display and we end up with a horrid film. This movie really doesn&apos;t work on any level as it&apos;s quite annoying in regards to the story because we&apos;re usually just sitting here watching annoying people having annoying fights that get on our nerves. I must admit that I really didn&apos;t care about any of these people and I certainly wasn&apos;t worried about their fate. I always say you&apos;re in trouble when you&apos;re watching a horror movie and hoping our humans get killed sooner rather than later so you can stop the movie. Another problem is the technical stuff and the fact that it&apos;s just not very good. The various camera set-ups never really do much and in the end you&apos;re left with an ugly film with characters you don&apos;t care about. Even worse is that there&apos;s no any scares, no atmosphere and really no reason to watch the film. A couple of the performances are fine but this isn&apos;t enough to make you waste your time. I&apos;d also add there&apos;s a séance in the film where the woman uses her neighbor&apos;s teenage son&apos;s t-shirt to try and lure Gacy to come out. This here was rather tasteless."

      "reviewBody": "The dynamic and colorful life of Sam Houston is one of those epics stories that truly deserve a mini-series. Hopefully one day, one will be done for him. My guess is that his background as a slave owner works against having Houston honored in that way. One of the most glaring omissions of Man Of Conquest is the lack of black people and the issue of slavery which is one of the darker parts of the Texas story.\n\nThe film resembles D.W. Griffith&apos;s Abraham Lincoln biographical film in format. A quick passage through Houston&apos;s youth and military service with Andrew Jackson and he&apos;s governor of Tennessee. Then the story continues until the Battle Of San Jacinto with a brief epilogue. Another error mentions Houston was at the Battle Of New Orleans, he was not. He did however do some considerable Indian fighting, but also developed a great respect for the native people. In fact he moved in with his adoptive tribe, the Cherokees after the scandal of his divorce wrecked his political career in Tennessee.\n\nRichard Dix makes a solid and heroic Houston and his wives are played by Joan Fontaine as Eliza Allen and Gail Patrick as Margaret Lea. And Houston did not even meet Margaret Lea until after Texas was a republic on a visit to the United States.\n\nMexico by not populating its territory north of the Rio Grande left it pretty much open to whomever would settle and for awhile it was only Comanches, Arankawas, and Kiowa tribes. The bulk of settlers from the USA came from the south and some brought slavery and their slaves with them. Eventually East Texas became a cotton growing region like the rest of the cotton culture south. This is the part we don&apos;t talk about in this film.\n\nThe rest of the characters of Texas history are there, popularized by Walt Disney and John Wayne later on. Robert Armstrong, Robert Barrat, Victory Jory, Ralph Morgan, play Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett, William B. Travis, and Stephen F. Austin respectively. Edward Ellis plays a thinner and more subdued Andrew Jackson than you saw Lionel Barrymore do in The Gorgeous Hussy. Did you know Andrew Jackson took a secret trip to Texas while in the White House? I didn&apos;t either until I saw this film.\n\nTwo of Republic Pictures cowboy sidekicks got roles in this film. Max Terhune, minus his ventriloquist dummy, plays famed scout Deaf Smith and Gabby Hayes has an all purpose fictional sidekick role.\n\nThe Battle of San Jacinto isn&apos;t even played right. In fact it wasn&apos;t much of a battle because of the complete surprise that Houston got on General Santa Anna at dawn. The whole thing was over in about 20 minutes and more Texans lost their lives on the screen in Man Of Conquest than at the real battle.\n\nThis was Republic Pictures big budget item for 1939 and got Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Sound, and Best Musical Scoring. Herbert J. Yates really laid a lot of loot out from Republic for this film. The budget of about 10 Gene Autry and 10 Roy Rogers films went into Man Of Conquest.\n\nThe best treatment of the Sam Houston story is in TV film Gone To Texas which starred Sam Elliot as Houston. Man Of Conquest has not worn well over the years and its glaring historical inaccuracies will make any true Texan wince.",

      "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Director Phil Morrison and Writer Angus MacLachlan collaborated on &quot;Tater Tomater&quot;, which was featured at 1990&apos;s Sundance Festival. Together again, they have created a nice home-spun tapestry of family relationships. Despite its seemingly bizarre group of characters, we find ourselves easily relating to the difficulties in understanding and communicating with those in our family - those who should be most like us.\n\nThe filmmakers have assembled a cast of mostly veteran actors, but no Hollywood &quot;stars&quot;. The most recognizable is Benjamin McKenzie (&quot;The O.C.&quot;) who plays the simmering quiet little brother whose wife, played brilliantly by Amy Adams, is with child. Others include Embeth Davidtz as the wife of prodigal son George (Alessandro Nivola, who played Pollux Troy in the underrated &quot;Face/Off&quot;); an electric Frank Hoyt Taylor as the off-center civil war artist David Wark; and veterans Celia Weston and Scott Wilson as the parents of the feuding boys. As a point of interest look for Saturday Night Live alum Victoria Jackson as one of the nurses.\n\nAlthough the film&apos;s heart and soul is the theme of family and the stress it creates, while somehow producing the draw that cannot be ignored, it also does a really wonderful job of capturing the spirit of southern small time living. At the center of all of this is Amy Adams, who literally steals the film as the eternally optimistic and determined &quot;firecracker&quot; Ashley. Her performance is outstanding, multi-layered, thought-provoking and genuine. Kind of doubt that this film will receive the necessary attention to have her nominated for an Academy Award, but she deserves one.\n\nThis is a necessarily slow-moving film that can be uncomfortable to watch, while at the same time causing you to smile, laugh and even tear up.",

      "reviewBody": "OK this film is cheap, with limited effects and a relatively unknown cast. It just proves that you don&apos;t need allowed of money or Hollywood to entertain somebody for a couple of hours. I was sceptical before viewing this movie but i must say it was surprisingly enjoyable and original.\n\nSome guys are doing an army exercise in the woods of Scotland, when they are stalked and chased by werewolves. They manage to escape the woods and reach the only house nearby, where they end up desperately fighting for their lives against some savage beasts.\n\nThis is by no means a straight out horror movie. There is a lot of action and even some moments of comedy. There is also a clever twist towards the end and the audience is kept guessing who will survive and who won&apos;t. The men act like true heroes in the fighting and I genuinely felt for them - unlike in so many horror films.\n\nAnother thing I particularly loved about Dog Soldiers is that it&apos;s so British. I&apos;m tired of so many good American horror movies! The setting in Scotland, the dialogue and the men are very British. Although its not completely original many elements of this film are. Admittedly the effects aren&apos;t great and although a bit jumpy at times I didn&apos;t find this one scary (though that isn&apos;t its main aim).\n\nA refreshing and entertaining film; OK its not a classic but i still recommend it. If you liked this check out the Descent (by the same director) with a bit more cash",

      "reviewBody": "Shyam Benegal is an international award winning film director who made his name in the 1970&apos;s with films, such as Anker (1974), that focus on controversial subjects involving the examination of fraught, complex social and cultural relationships. These films tend to concentrate on the lower rungs of Indian society. Zubeidaa is a refreshing update in this mode of film-making, as Benegal transfers his name-making qualities to a subject at the higher end of society.\n\nIt is the story of a young man, Riyaz, who goes on a journey to discover what has happened to his mysterious mother, absent for as long as he can remember. What he discovers is reenacted in scenes set not long after independence, as the naïve but headstrong young Zubeidaa is scandalised by her romance, and subsequent marriage to Prince Vijayendra Singh of Fatehpur, head of a grand Hindu ruling royal family. As a middle class Muslim divorcée with a child by another man, her relationship with the Prince is naturally complicated by socio-political and religious factors.\n\nBut not only does she become entangled in the politics of the royal circle around the Prince, particularly in her relationship with the Prince&apos;s first wife, Mandira Devi, she also gets caught up in the larger politics of India. The film is set during a time not long after Independence, a time of change and uncertainty for the traditional ruling class of India, which still laid claim to about a third of the country.\n\nThough it is clear that this film is much more than royal watching, having such a subject naturally supports a lavish treatment, which Benegal ably supplies, as well as making the film&apos;s content rich in nuance and resonance, handling its mature romantic storyline gracefully, and skilfully embedding it into its larger historical context.\n\nThe characters are generally very well developed with empathy and without judgement or cliché. The acting matches this. Karisma Kapoor captures the strength and naivety of Zubeidaa with aplomb, and Rekha is authoritative and understated as the enigmatic Mandira Devi.\n\nThe only problem I have with the film is Zubeidaa&apos;s grown son, Riyaz. Riyaz is imperative to the film, since the viewer follows him on his journey of discovery. Seeing great characters through the eyes of other characters is a useful fictional device, most successfully utilised in Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s novel, The Great Gatsby. Nick Carraway&apos;s character is revealed by his journey in discovering Gatsby. However, in Zubeidaa, Riyaz stays enigmatic while discovering his mother, and even, at times, comes across as anodyne, feeling more like a biographer looking into an interesting episode in history, not a son trying to find his mother. Rajat Kapoor, playing Riyaz, does not manage to rise above his character&apos;s failings. And so, unfortunately, the film ends up feeling incomplete."

In my opinion, the movie left out some stuff that would have made it a LOT more interesting!!!  Some people seem to think that parts of the movie are unrealistic, but when you read the book and get all the detail and everything, it starts to become a lot more believable than it is in the movie.  Plus, the older brother has a MUCH larger role in the book, which makes more sense than how they protrayed him in the movie.  Anyway, I guess you can tell, what I&apos;m trying to say is, READ THE BOOK!!!!  :-)"

Add to that, the cheesiest effects and worst directing I&apos;ve ever seen. The story made no sense , yet every step of the way we&apos;re supposed to believe this nonsense. But allegedly, the US government keeps alien corpses in retirees barns. And top-secret government documents in filing cabinets in said barn. Plus the lead character isn&apos;t ignoramus, and treats his girl terribly. He is a giant manchild invading the privacy of his grandfather. I wish I could get the hour and 20 minutes back of my life that this film took. Fortunately I watched it for free on Netflix otherwise I&apos;d be very ticked off.

      "reviewBody": "I may have seen this film ages ago but seeing clips in Johnny Gaddaar reminded me that I needed to revisit the film. The film was an early career venture for Navin Nischol and Amitabh. Navin was cute, romanced the girl (Yogita Bali - was she a bit squint eyed?), got all the song numbers, and Big B played the sensitive introverted artist who secretly loves the girl but cannot have her. But seeing her with Navin twists the knife of jealousy deeper and deeper in until he decides that all is fair in love and war and declares a most insidious war. Yogita was OK, Om Prakash was a complete natural as ever, and Shotgun Sinha over-acted like hell in a cameo court scene. There was an obligatory item number from Helen. Oh - Kaifi Azmi wrote the lyrics and they were mostly mundane. Two songs were decent - Yun Na Sharma, Phaila De Apni Gori Gori Baahen and Simti Si Sharmai Si Kis Duniya Se tum Aayi ho.\n\nThe film had a very B-grade feel to it but the plot was extremely innovative - no wonder Sriram Raghavan got inspired! Navin Nischol was like a lost kid and it was hard to get too involved in the lovers played by him and Yogita. Amitabh was intense all the way through and had flashes of brilliance in the film. But it was the 70s and his negative role had to have redemption at the end. There might have been some problem with the way the character of Kumar developed because while the film was most interesting and engaging throughout I felt a clinical detachment from the players as I watched it. I think this was not very much like Jewel Thief and Johnny Mera Naam, instead of a whodunit suspenseful tale this was a Howdunit and very unique for its time. Worth a watch for the plot and for seeing the beginnings of Big B.",

First, for 40 opening minutes, there will be too much theatricality. But later on, this fades away.\n\nAnd the religious brother, Alyosha, is seriously miscast. Instead of bearing passion and superhuman will, we see Myagkov quite the opposite. There will be glimpses of true Alyosha, but most of the time he is misbehaving.\n\nOther than that, it is very good film.",

      "reviewBody": "This film begins in Istanbul with a private detective named &quot;Joe Walker&quot; (Tony Kendall) visiting a small nightclub where he is attempting to gather information concerning a large batch of LSD which was recently stolen from the American military by an international syndicate known as &quot;the Green Hounds&quot;. Not surprisingly, Joe&apos;s sudden presence at the nightclub soon becomes a cause for concern which leads the girlfriend of the syndicate boss to order one of the employees to slip some LSD into his drink. Fortunately, although he is tricked into drinking it, he manages to escape before they can kill him and eventually recovers with the help of his old colleague &quot;Captain Tom Rowland&quot; (Brad Harris). It&apos;s then that the two join forces in a effort to find and recover the stolen merchandise before the Green Hounds have the opportunity to disperse it throughout Europe. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this 4th film in the &quot;Kommissar X&quot; series was one of the better entries as the action and the plot were more evenly balanced. Likewise, having several attractive actresses like Sabine Sun (as the duplicitous girlfriend named &quot;Joyce Sellers&quot;), Christa Linder (&quot;Gisela&quot;), Olga Schoberova (&quot;Leyla Kessler&quot;) and Rossella Bergamonti (&quot;Jenny Carter&quot;) certainly didn&apos;t hurt in any way either. In any case, I liked this particular sequel and have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

George has writer&apos;s block and can&apos;t figure things out in time to graduate, but people come into his life to help out right when he needs it. This movie is hilarious with hidden references to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies and a few of Lucas&apos; other works! Something that is fun to show a small group of people late at night, or just a die hard SW fan. And great for outright laughs and something to chew on before EPISODE III opens on May 19th!\n\nSearch the web for this, it comes pretty cheap at $12-15 per copy, and is well worth the money spent!!!",

No special DVD or anything, it just sits there, waiting to be discovered. I saw this when it first hit the theater, and I have it on VHS (yeah yeah I know, I&apos;m just waiting for the special edition DVD to come out!). I love the plot of this one. Ben Stiller travels with his perfectly cast wife, Patricia Arquette and the adoption agency agent, played by Tia Leoni to try to discover his parents who gave him up for adoption. He needs to have a sense of closure, and also to give a name to his son. He probably didn&apos;t realize that this would involve Indian wrestling, truck driving lessons, or a married male couple of FBI agents. The story just piles one hilarious situation after another. I&apos;ve seen this film at LEAST 10 times and I STILL laugh out loud. It&apos;s just THAT funny!",

      "reviewBody": "I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don&apos;t They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.\n\nAnd let&apos;s just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this. No way could this be anything near as good as the original. And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded. Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn&apos;s title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden. Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man. He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot. In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances. Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.\n\nHe did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be. I mean, Cinderella move over. Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven. It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur&apos;s daughter than what transpires here.\n\nQuickly here&apos;s the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate. She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name. When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.\n\nThe basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina&apos;s character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic. Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow&apos;s end she gets. I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): &quot;They want romance, they want woman&apos;s fantasy? They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting? How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers? She can take her pick. We&apos;ve give &apos;em romance, we&apos;ll give &apos;em dreams come true!&quot; And they do. Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.\n\nOf course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla&apos;s Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson. I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this &quot;let them eat cake&quot; line: &quot;We thought we&apos;d use recycled paper&quot; (for the wedding invitations).\n\nThe script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy. For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: &quot;America is my country and Paris is my home.&quot; (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)\n\nI also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me–observes with perfect decorum, &quot;I&apos;m embarrassed that you&apos;re somewhere else.&quot;\n\nMemorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt. By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.\n\nI especially liked it when he sadly confessed: &quot;I was sent to deal with you. I sent myself.&quot; \n\nIt is probably better if you haven&apos;t seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons. Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez. They really are very different people. And comparing Billy Wilder&apos;s 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney&apos;s Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s.\n\nBottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the &quot;only surviving heart donor&quot; very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

      "reviewBody": "While often a bit obscure, this Dovzhenko classic is also filled with interesting and often thought-provoking images and themes. &quot;Arsenal&quot;, as with his better-known feature &quot;Earth&quot;, defies easy description. &quot;Earth&quot; is probably the more artistic of the two, but &quot;Arsenal&quot; is more complex, and it might also be a little closer - at least in places - to a conventional narrative.\n\nThe first ten minutes or so of &quot;Arsenal&quot; are quite abstract, with a succession of mini-montages depicting a variety of subjects. It would be hard, and perhaps inadvisable, to assign a specific meaning to all of the symbols, but they are clearly meant to convey some general ideas that apply to the story that follows, which is set in the Ukraine as World War I (or the Great War) is coming to an end.\n\nThe war sequences might be the most memorable part of the movie, and the chilling &quot;laughing gas&quot; sequence is a more compelling comment on war than are the great majority of complicated carnage-filled scenes in other movies.\n\nThe main story starts with the demobilization, and it is clearly influenced by Dovzhenko&apos;s own perspective. He does his very best to resolve two seemingly contradictory priorities, with his devotion to the Ukrainian people and his support for the Soviet state. He uses all his skills, with interesting montages and other techniques, including some creative camera angles that would even have impressed Orson Welles.\n\nAs politics, not all of it is convincing by any means, but as cinema, it is quite interesting, and at times it provides good food for thought. The specific issues considered in the film may be limited to their own time and place, but in asking what is best for his people, Dovzhenko also raises some broader issues that allow the movie to retain some relevance in later eras as well."

      "reviewBody": "There have been so many versions of this literary masterpiece filmed that it is high praise indeed from me when I say this is easily my favourite version and one of the best. Albert Finney gives a tour-de-force performance as Ebeneezer Scrooge. He is barely middle-age when making the film yet gives one of the best cranky, curmudgeonly old man performances seen in film. Finney gives such life to lines that have become tainted by overuse over the years. All the performers do excellent jobs with some old English stalwarts lending a hand. Dame Edith Evans plays one of the most charming and pithy Ghosts of Christmas Pasts I have seen. Kenneth More, an under-appreciated actor, adds so much life as the Ghost of Christmas Present. And let&apos;s not forget Alec Guinness as the Ghost of Jacob Marley. In some moments he is a clown and others a very scary spirit. The scene where Scrooge sees his fate as being a co-worker of Marley&apos;s in Hell is one of the most innovative plot additions I have seen to this classic, timeless tale. Guinness hams it up; watch how he walks with those chains all over him. The actors playing Cratchit, Tiny Tim, Nephew Fred, Mr. Fezziwig, and so on are all very believable and give genuine performances. I love the music. I know some people are not musical people, but each song is catchy and some like &quot;I Hate People,&quot; &quot;I Like Life,&quot; &quot;December the 25th,&quot; and the best &quot;Thank You Very Much&quot; will possibly remain in your head days after having seen the film. Because of its status as a tale of redemption and forgiveness and the possibility each of us have in changing our lives, A Christmas Carol(Scrooge) gets little recognition for being one of the greatest ghost stories ever written. I cannot say enough good about this film. What more can you ask for than good, solid acting, mellifluous tunes, authentic Victorian settings, and one heck of a good ghost story with a moral that each of us can relate to. If you don&apos;t like musicals, you will be put off by people combusting into song. As for me, Scrooge is the one version that my family and I make a point of seeing every holiday season. It just isn&apos;t Christmas here without it!",

      "reviewBody": "Any documentary about a successful Berlin Cabaret performer, film actor and film director is the exciting and creative world of pre-WWII Germany -- who performed with Weill, Brecht, Marlene Dietrich, etc -- would be in itself unique and fascinating.  This documentary certainly fulfills that expectation.  In addition, it is the sad, tragic story of how a great artist was hounded and dehumanized by the Nazis.  Finally, it is the incredible story of how the Nazis coerced Kurt Gerron to direct one of its most outrageous propaganda films to try to show the world that the Terezin Concentration Camp was a paradise for Jews sent to live in the &quot;east.&quot; The reality was that Terezin was a squalid, overcrowded transit camp -- where many died from disease -- and tens of thousands were transported to Auschwitz (and other camps) to be murdered.  In the end, Gerron was coerced to face the ethical dilemna that the Nazis posed to all their prisoners: &quot;As long as you help us, we have a reason to keep you alive -- so ... How soon do you want to die?&quot;\n\nDid Gerron make the film because he was selfishly trying to save himself and his family?  If so ... so what?  Wouldn&apos;t you have done that?  On the other hand, it is even more tragic to think that Gerron probably knew that the Nazis would never let him live -- and that this was his last chance to work -- to be creative -- to be a &quot;macher&quot; -- to have a modicum of control over his life.  Like all great artists, he did not want to produce anything less than his best.  Certainly, many of the &quot;actors&quot; in the film were forced to pretend to be happy.  On the other hand, when you see children eating bread and butter joyfully -- and you know that they would not have such food were it not for this film -- you can imagine that perhaps they were not pretending to enjoy the food.  Similarly, the chorale group, the children&apos;s musical, and the symphony (performing &quot;Study for Strings,&quot; written by Pavel Haas while he was incarcerated in Terezin) were not &quot;pretending.&quot;  They were enthusiastically displaying their love for their art and their pride of accomplishment.  The Nazis should be vilified for their treatment of these artists.  But the artists have nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nThe film raises more questions than it answers.  And some of the answers it suggests may not be convincing.  But that is another reason why this film is deeply moving and valuable.\n\nThis is an extremely well-made documentary -- excellently preserving much archival film footage.  Ian Holm is an outstanding narrator.  And the moments we see Gerron&apos;s acting and hear his singing are likely to encourage you to want to rent several of his films.  Nominated for the 2003 Oscar -- amongst Spellbound, Winged Migration and Bowling for Columbine -- this film is further evidence that today&apos;s documentary film makers are among the best creative artists in the cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "A perfect antidote or bookend to ON THE TOWN this excellent, mature and solid cinemascope musical is an absolute knockout. Made by MGM to placate Kelly for refusing to loan him to Samuel Goldwyn for GUYS AND DOLLS this film is probably one of the few 50s MGM efforts that plays well to audiences in 2004........but only of one sees it in cinemascope. Inventive use of the widescreen allows superb choreography to become ironic and witty......and the bewildering idiocy of TV stations to only show the center of the screen is an insult to any audience seeking to enjoy this clever and thoughtful musical. A small profit on first release and a drive in future saw this pic drop from view early in its life. the dance numbers are uniformly (no pun) astonishing and sometimes hilarious (especially Dolores Gray) BUT... I yi yi...Cyd Charisse in Baby You Knock Me Out lives up to its title. Trivia alert: one of the old boxers at Stillman&apos;s Gym is Gus Mecurio, father of STRICTLY BALLROOM lead dancer and actor Paul Mecurio. Kelly on skates is as good as Kelly singin in the rain...it&apos;s the same number but on wheels!.....this is a great film and a perfect musical. Imagine Kelly&apos;s rage at MGM after refusing him the Guys and Dolls loan out and they they distribute that film for Goldwyn anyway! No wonder WEATHER is such a suitably dark film of the disillusionment met head on in the American mid 50s. A full revival is much deserved.",

The illusion is overwhelming and the idea that we&apos;re seeing and hearing something that we shouldn&apos;t is part of its fascination. I loved Richard Fleischer&apos;s 1959 film from Meyer Levin&apos;s novel. I was enthralled by Dean Stockwell&apos;s performance and that&apos;s the only missing element here. Dean Stockwell. However, Tom Kalin has masterminded a narration that makes the whole thing so close to what it really must have been that the experience, for all film lovers, should be a must.",

It has lots of action, a very good spaghetti style music score, fun dialogue, a great villain, gold, the Mexican revolution, and the great Gianni Garko as The Holy Ghost.\n\nGenerally, I prefer the darker, more serious spaghetti westerns over the comedic ones that became popular in the early seventies, and I wasn&apos;t expecting this one to be a comedy, but it is. What&apos;s even more surprising is that it&apos;s an excellent one that succeeds as both a comedy and a very cool spaghetti western. The funny parts are genuinely funny and, in a way, remind me of the classic comedy of the Three Stooges. This movie is ten times funnier and more interesting than any of the Terence Hill/ Bud Spencer movies that I have seen.\n\nAnother surprise about this movie is that the Holy Ghost character is not really &quot;supernatural&quot; as he is described in every single description of this movie I have ever seen. There is one short scene close to the beginning of the film in which he seems to be able to appear out of nowhere, but that&apos;s it! For the next 85 minutes of this 90 minute movie, the Holy Ghost is a mere mortal named Harold who is very resourceful and quick with a gun, but definitely no ghost.\n\nI was curious about this movie mainly because I can&apos;t resist a supernatural western, especially if it&apos;s an Italian one! It isn&apos;t exactly what I thought it was going to be, but I&apos;m pleasantly surprised that it&apos;s an excellent spaghetti western anyway, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.",

      "reviewBody": "My absolutely favorite Jack Nicholson film has always and forever will be The Last Detail. I don&apos;t think he was ever better on the screen as William Baddusky of the United States Navy. I enjoyed his performance and the film itself on so many levels. Probably not surprising since the script was done by Robert Towne who would soon be teaming with Nicholson again for the critical and popular success Chinatown.\n\nIt&apos;s a simple story, not really any plot to the film. Two sailors, Jack Nicholson and Otis Young, both of them lifers in the Navy are stationed in Norfolk and get themselves an assignment to escort a prisoner to the Naval Stockade at Portsmouth. Of course with the per diem allowance for the two men and the prisoner and five days to travel in, Nicholson and Young are thinking of a mini-spree at government expense. \n\nIt comes to that and a lot more. the prisoner is newcomer Randy Quaid whose big crime is that he attempted to steal $40.00 from a charity collection box. For that he&apos;s getting eight years in military prison and a dishonorable discharge. A dishonorable discharge even today is not a good thing for one&apos;s resume. \n\nAs Nicholson and Young both remark, someone really stuck it to him. Let&apos;s face it what Quaid did in civilian life would probably be considered petty larceny and his jail time might be measured in days. Turned out it was the base commander&apos;s wife&apos;s favorite charity so it got stuck to him good. Sad because the indications we get is that Quaid was a troubled kid in civilian life and probably military service offered him a chance to straighten up and fly right.\n\nIt&apos;s done that for many others including Nicholson and Young who make it very clear even on this disagreeable detail they do like the Navy and like serving in it. \n\nThey&apos;ve got five days to deliver Quaid to Portsmouth so the journey becomes quite the odyssey for the three of them up the Atlantic coast. The three men have a great chemistry between them, you get involved with their lives and really feel for young Quaid and his plight. Quaid gets shown a good time and maybe that&apos;s not such a good thing considering what he is facing.\n\nThe Last Detail is a nice realistic look at the military both its flaws and good points. A lot of similarity here in the issues raised to From Here to Eternity and if I mention The Last Detail in the same sentence favorably as From Here to Eternity, you know how good it must be.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;My Dear Secretary&quot; is an odd film, as the first and last portions of the film vary so much in quality. The first is brisk and funny--the second is very slow and completely different. It&apos;s too bad because if the film could have maintained its pace, it would be an excellent and enjoyable picture. Instead, it&apos;s just frustrating to watch.\n\nThe film begins with Laraine Day being hired as a secretary to a successful writer. She&apos;s excited by this but her excitement soon wanes as she sees that her new employer (Kirk Douglas) is a very immature and undisciplined guy. Again and again, instead of working on his book, he takes the secretary and his friend (Keenan Wynn) out gambling and on spur of the moment vacations! \n\nDespite this portion of the film being hard to believe, it was quite funny--particularly for Wynn, who provided wonderful support. However, completely out of the blue, Day (who is rather conservative) marries Douglas--a wedding that makes absolutely no sense at all. And, as if the unlikelihood of the pairing also threw the writer, the film just languished and stopped being funny. Instead, the marriage soon begins to fizzle and Douglas&apos; attempt to write his next great novel seems to be a bust. There&apos;s more to it than this--including Day becoming a great writer herself and a divorce--but none of it made much sense or kept my interest.\n\nRarely have I seen such an uneven film. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did and can say it&apos;s, at best, just an amiable time-passer and nothing more.",

I contributed some e-mail comments but refused to appear in person because I could not determine what the underlying views of the producer and director was. I did not want to contribute to a hack job on my younger brother.\n\nI think it was Churchill who said that people who are not liberal when they are young have no heart but those who are not conservative when they are old have no brain.\n\nDean was just beginning to learn how the real world works before he died. I am confident if he had lived as long as I have he would have realized the terrible results of collectivism. Dale"

And Jeffrey Hunter was a favorite as well. Made in 1952, the year of my birth, I remember it for its vivid color and mountainous beauty. Yesterday&apos;s (June 30, 2013) announcement of the death of 19 smoke-jumpers in Arizona had me spot on with the memory of &quot;The Red Skies of Montana&quot;! Got the name, the stars, and year of release all correct. Now, that&apos;s an impressive movie. I highly recommend it.",

Cameron Mitchell movies are always watchable. Especially when there is an eye-patch involved.

Gave it a &quot;5&quot; because it&apos;s definitely one of those get it or not movies. I think I bought a lawnmower from that detective guy in scene 29 over at ACE in 1974.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;His Name Was Pot... But They Called Him Allegria&quot; is another one of the too many cheap westerns which Fidani directed. If the movie had a script, it could be summed up like this: The two brothers Pot (Peter Martell) and Ray (Gordon Mitchell) rob a bank together. They meet Steve (Lincoln Tate) and make him their new partner. Supported by an old man who knows everything about dynamite, the 4 outlaws rob a bigger bank. Ray is killed soon after, but only after Pot finds a medal that belonged to his brother, he knows about it and wants revenge. \n\nThe movie is below average in every respect and instantly forgettable except for Martell who puts a sympathetic personal stamp of interpretation on his role: an unwashed lawless man who takes what life offers him every day, ignoring all the rules, and he can even laugh about himself which is such a rare quality.",

      "reviewBody": "A love story for cerebral cineastes. A delight to watch after dinner with a philosophy professor friend and three glasses of wine, and it belongs right up there with your volumes of Wittgenstein. Upon more sober viewing, my analytic mind felt challenged. Actually, this reflects the film&apos;s purposeful plotting. Being a psychiatrist, let&apos;s see what I can offer. \n\nThe film exemplifies Godard&apos;s maxim that all it takes to make a movie is a girl and a gun. In this case the lead female characters are two lovely blondes. Each so cleverly resembles the other that one is reminded of Discreet Object of Desire, the surrealist flick where two actresses played one character. \n\nBut adding layers of complexity here, these twin-like actresses are also playing the left and right sides of the brain of the feminine anima of one male character. Got that? They all meet at the Pigeon Hole lounge. The first character is the young Hoyle, a feminine Bogart/Sam Spade analytic detective - the left brain. Like Sam she likes the gin and the story straight. The second is a sultry, un-named singer who has a familiarity with the poetics of T.S. Eliot - the brain&apos;s right. Her music is entrancing, her wit intuitive and nonlinear. Together, these two provide the counterpoint of Jung&apos;s anima to the male animus of the main character, Dudas. \n\nWhether Hoyle and her counterpart, Singer, convince us they are our anima is irrelevant as we so want them to be part of us. These lovelies draw us ever so seductively into imagining the dark recesses of our own beautiful unconscious, despite whatever misgivings. All we&apos;re here for is love, we are told. The shape of the universe is a relationship - functional or otherwise - whether with our inner parts or with our fellow beings. This makes for a strange little Jungian romp in luscious b&amp;w footage. This is Lynch with an underlying premise. Somewhat like the film Pi, this low budget beauty was made at the cost of Pi (made at $60,000) times pi! \n\nFirst time director James Kerwin makes for a Jungian fortune teller taking us on a trip to disentangle or re-entangle our male and female halves. Kerwin is an urban shaman who shows us the conventional mind as a &quot;surge suppressor&quot;. Our conscious minds filter small broken bits of time in a lame attempt to tell a story. Does it matter whether they &quot;add up&quot;? \n\nBeginning with some obvious allegory, the locks are broken off the allegorical unconscious and our character, curiously named Hoyle bravely walks into a poetic film noir journey to confront the Self. (Hoyle seems named after transcendental astronomer/physicist Fred Hoyle who was deeply intrigued by the &quot;Anthropic Principle&quot; of nature.) We begin with a look at Dali&apos;s surrealist masterpiece Persistence of Memory in a hallway. They meet Schrödinger&apos;s cat, the parable of which tells us there are opposite angles on everything and only by choosing do we arrives at any definitive perspective. Free Will is discussed. The film reveals a Jungian Fenestra Aeternitatus, a window to the eternal, that our characters need to navigate. \n\nA variety of other cutting edge consciousness theories are peppered throughout the film to spice the intellectual interest of the knowledgeable viewer, including pondering Planck&apos;s constant, a number describing the fundamental vibration at the Ground of Being. For those less informed, the film literally goes back to the psychiatrist to explain itself. Jung, we are told, said a man needs to project his animus onto the feminine anima in order to unlock the secrets of the universe. This is a film for men who are in need of seeing themselves and for women who want a deeper look into those men. What does a man see in himself as a woman? \n\nHoyle goes into a dream within a dream (hasn&apos;t everyone had at least one of these?) to contact her animus, Dudas, who has a notebook of important thoughts or ideas. Meanwhile we are constantly asked, what if our theories, concepts of self, and common sense don&apos;t add up? And what does that tell us about our relationships? And what is the nature and consequence of the loss of &quot;relationship&quot;? The right-sided feminine asks the questions. Left-sided Hoyle tries to read the tea leaves, the pattern in the chaos. Hoyle and her doppelganger meet another aspect of their animus, a scientist who explains the nature of time and who feels these two sexy blondes are &quot;better&quot; and &quot;better&quot;. They are also the choices that interface with reality. They will help us overcome our own guilt about our very existence and the broken promises to ourselves and to others. \n\nA deep understanding of time is seen in this film&apos;s Feynman diagram writ large in cinema. Physicist Feynman showed everything else might be one mind/particle bouncing backwards and forwards in time, appearing as each and all of us trying to make contact with every part of experience over eternity, the very fabric of time. This reach for the eternal is countered by the Shadow, the dark side, who delivers a bit of lead poisoning in the form of bullets. Death&apos;s shadow is a terrifying/exhilarating lockdown on the many-sided reality of now, it haunts our Selves. It occurs when we bring our stories to a halt. We need to let go of our life-text and grab onto our fuller selves, leaving our memories to be what they are and move on to script ourselves anew. \n\nThis film is an ultimate romance with &quot;The Other&quot;, a mix of the cosmos and the chaos, the order and the disorder, the male and the female. In this cocktail lounge of our emotions, letting go of our primordial selfishness lets our unconscious sing its own songs, reconciling the Self to itself. And pay attention to terrific music in here. Chase Masterson sings beautifully the lounge songs of our longing."

The key scene in relation to &apos;Salo&apos; is when the &apos;victims&apos; enter the chateau and once they are in the chateau suffer the same sort of torments as in Pasolini&apos;s film.\n\nThe basic difference between the two films is that despite the horrific subject matter Vadim retains a sense of romanticism which Pasolini rejected. It is a great pity this film is not more widely available on video as it is beautifully shot in scope with a delirious score that mixes Gotterdammerung with &apos;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&apos;!\n\nThe acting, especially from Annie Girardot is exemplary. You can see why this actress gave a such a terrific performance recently in &apos;La Pianiste&apos;. It was however one of Deneuve&apos;s first roles and like all her early films she was not at her best, but clearly decorative.\n\nA &apos;must-see&apos; film for all those film lovers who have appreciated the likes of &apos;The Night Porter&apos; and Visconti&apos;s &apos;The Damned&apos;.\n\n10/10",

They introduce him to their seniors on the site: Cyrano de Bergerac and the Baron Munchausen. Munchausen takes the Moon Man (for so he must be) on a trip to the Earth in what appears to be the 18th century. There they rescue the fair princess Jana Brejchová from the Sultan of Turkey and go on a series of imaginative adventures.\n\nIt must have been a dangerous movie to produce in Czechoslovakia in 1962. It celebrates imagination. It&apos;s not even imagination in the service of anything except itself. It&apos;s the imagination of a boy, just looking up from his loved library of Jules Verne and Alexandre Dumas and noticing girls for the first time. The set designs reinforce this. They look like Dore steel engravings, and the stock is toned, occasionally for what seems to be early two-strip Technicolor, with flashes of bright colors. Munchausen fights ten thousand bashi-bazouks; he flies about on cannonballs and dwells in a whale for months. He does whatever he pleases, as the fancy strikes him, and Jellinek follows along. Will he ever develop an imagination of his own?\n\nIt&apos;s clear to me that Terry Gilliam mined this movie extensive for his own MUNCHAUSEN; there are too many settings and incidents for it to be otherwise. He would have been 24 when it premiered in the US at Pacificon. I have no doubt that he saw it there and it left an impression in his mind at least as great as in my own.",

      "reviewBody": "John CASSAVETES as a slick gangster in Rome\n\nIt&apos;s the old story: A beautiful mannequin (Anita Sanders) gets involved with a windy charmer (John Cassavetes), who often does very crooked things with his buddy (very evil: Nikos Kourkoulos). Of course that doesn&apos;t suit the inspector (Gabriele Ferzetti). And so what has to happen happens. One friend is arrested, the other wants to take over, including the beautiful woman! The old drama, told again and again!\n\nWith this film, successful producer Dino De LAURENTIIS (Silvana MANGANO&apos;s husband) started the wave of Italian crime films that would ensure CINECITTA&apos;s income and livelihood until the early 1980s. Beautiful pictures of Rome, up and down the Via Veneto and also the luxury shops on the Via Condotti are appreciated in detail. 320 million ITL were sold in the domestic box office.\n\nJohn Cassavetes was simply on a roll after The Dirty Dozen and Rosemary&apos;s Baby. Back then, no one could manage this engaging self-satisfaction as well as he did. The still quite young Giancarlo Prete (1943-2001) has a small appearance.\n\nNot bad, but not a big hit yet! It wasn&apos;t supposed to come out in the Poliziottesco genre until 1972!",

This for me is definitely a 10 out of 10 picture which i might watch again tonight actually even though i only saw it yesterday."

He has a tremendous screen presence, more than just his stature (plus he had to do his own stunts!).\n\nThere are lots of memorable scenes throughout the movie.

But it&apos;s easy to see how &apos;Drag&apos; was permitted to fade into obscurity, because this film is so very bad: even as an historic artefact, it&apos;s nearly worthless. Frankly, many (perhaps even most) of Hollywood&apos;s so-called &apos;lost&apos; films have vanished precisely because they weren&apos;t much good in the first place, and therefore weren&apos;t much worth preserving. For every genuine cinematic masterpiece that appears to be gone forever, such as Murnau&apos;s &apos;4 Devils&apos;, there are a hundred or more reels of drivel such as &apos;Drag&apos; that might exist in somebody&apos;s attic but aren&apos;t worth tracking down.\n\n&apos;Drag&apos; is an early talkie, and -- like several other films from the beginning of the sound era -- its most creaking flaw is the underscripted dialogue. Silent films were made from scenarios rather than fully-fledged screenplays: the scenarist would indicate the actions and the emotional states of the characters, but wouldn&apos;t write extensive dialogue. One or two lines of dialogue might be included, to convey the content of an entire sequence. Dialogue-writing was considered a separate skill, entrusted to title-card writers *after* the actors&apos; footage was completed. Many of the early sound films were made in this same way, with scenarios rather than scripts ... leaving the actors with insufficient dialogue to carry their scenes. The most notorious example of this was &apos;His Glorious Night&apos;, with John Gilbert desperately improvising variations on &apos;I love you&apos; through an entire romantic sequence. Several scenes in &apos;Drag&apos; feature actors speaking generic dialogue and then repeating the same lines a bit more desperately, clearly unable to improvise beyond the meagre lines of the scenario. Matters are made worse in &apos;Drag&apos; by extremely poor sound recording, as well as the fact that some of these actors seem to have no experience with dialogue at all. (This too was a hazard of the early talkie era.)\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD. Richard Barthelmess plays David Carroll, the publisher of a small-town newspaper. The small town is Paris, Vermont ... and there are some painful attempts to wring humour out of the fact that this hick town is named Paris. David is married to Allie ... but the marriage is a package deal, because her in-laws are living with David too and cadging off him. The in-laws are Ma and Pa Parker and their son Charlie Parker, who doesn&apos;t seem to realise he has the same name as a jazz saxophonist. David feuds constantly with his in-laws, but his wife always takes their side.\n\nThe only sympathetic citizen of Paris (the one in Vermont) is Dot, a vivacious and artistic young lady who doesn&apos;t seem to be a native of this hick burg, although it&apos;s hard to believe she voluntarily came here from elsewhere. Dot moves to New York City, inspiring Dave to do the same. He walks out on his wife and her relations, and he moves to Manhattan. With laughable ease, David writes a play and gets it produced on Broadway! Conveniently, Dot is the costume designer for the play, so she and David will be spending lots of time together. (Actually, I&apos;ve been peripherally involved in a couple of Broadway productions, and I&apos;ve never seen the playwright and the costume designer working together: each has plenty of work to do in his or her separate craft without impinging on the other&apos;s.)\n\nFrom this point, the most obvious plot twist would be for David to sever all ties with his wife and the Parkers, and start a new life with Dot. &apos;Drag&apos; does something more surprising here, but that&apos;s not really a point in its favour. Feeling tempted to dally with Dot, David sends for his wife Allie to join him in New York so that he&apos;ll remain faithful to her. Even though Dot is a dilly, he&apos;d rather dally with Allie. What happens next is no surprise: Allie&apos;s brother and parents show up too, and once again they all move in with David. The payoff is quite dull.\n\nDespite the terrible script -- really not much more than a scenario -- I&apos;ll give the makers of this film some credit for attempting a story about a protagonist in an atypical situation. In the real world, someone in David Carroll&apos;s situation would either stick with his wife or abandon her altogether. Richard Barthelmess (showing more acting ability than this story deserves) plausibly portrays David as a married man who is attracted to an exciting &apos;other woman&apos; yet who still feels some love for (and loyalty to) his dull familiar wife. Barthelmess&apos;s attempt to balance his character&apos;s conflicting emotions is the only major point of interest in this film.\n\nVeteran character actor Lucien Littlefield is briefly impressive as David&apos;s father-in-law, and Lila Lee is attractive and intelligent as Dot. All the other supporting actors are wooden and dull here. I was especially disappointed with Tom Dugan as David&apos;s brother-in-law. Dugan would later achieve a solid career as a dependable character actor (notably as the Hitler lookalike in &apos;To Be or Not to Be&apos;), but here he&apos;s barely recognisable and shows no glimmer of his later ability.\n\n&apos;Drag&apos; isn&apos;t the worst film I&apos;ve ever seen, but it&apos;s well down there. I&apos;ll rate this movie 2 points out of 10, mostly for Barthelmess&apos;s creditable attempt to navigate the pitfalls of a difficult role that&apos;s badly written. I&apos;ll make some allowance for the fact that this very poor talking picture was made at a time when *nobody* was an expert at making talkies.",

ACADEMY AWARD nominee Helmut Käutner directed this colorful and thoroughly entertaining film.\n\nIt tells the life of Johannes Bückler, who rises to become a robber captain in the Hunsrück, who steals from the rich and shares in his loot from the poor. Allegedly! This Schinderhannes is so charismatic that his lovers (e.g. Eva Pflug as shepherd Ammi) scratch each other&apos;s eyes out. But even a dashing aristocrat like Carl von Cleve-Boost (excellent as always: Christian Wolff) joins the band of robbers out of idealism. Of course there are also many opponents and envious people (&quot;The Old Fox&quot; Siegfried Lowitz). Everything will be fine at the side of Julchen, who becomes the great love of his life. Think...\n\nWith a wonderful touch of dialect, the piece by Carl Zuckmayer is presented in very beautiful pictures from the Rhine Palatinate and Mainz. A classic worth seeing that also benefits from the strong cast!",

The book, the Desert of the Tartars by Dino Buzzati is an allegory for a man life and destiny. A man&apos;s hope to greatness, to glory, to accomplish great deeds. But as time passes, greatness is never attained, glory never achieved. Most of us us settle down in our routine. Drogo full of youth and enthusiasm set up for Fort Bastiano, the fortress protecting the border of his country. With the passing of time the precise, monotonous routine in the fortress becomes his life. He returns to the city and to his fiancé, but the city life does not please him. This part of the book is never shown in the movie. He returns to the fortress with hope of greatness if the Tartars ever attack and the star of glory to defend his country will shine upon him. Time inexorably goes by. Rumors of sights of Tartars prowling in the desert below are just rumors. Drogo is, we are getting older. His health starts to fail. But there is still hope in his hearth that the enemy may come. Then suddenly the enemy comes. The Tartars are invading, the desert under Fort Bastiano is full of them, the war has started, and while Drogo is carried away a young inexperienced officer coming from the city will have the honor and the glory of defending his country. Drogo&apos;s carriage is taking him to the city below where the greatest of all Enemies is awaiting for him.",

Perhaps they are there... whenever my mood changes, seemingly unprompted, I always wonder.\n\nHijacked and debased by people who don&apos;t know any better (even U2, I&apos;m afraid, and the American remake must be avoided at all costs - ideally it should be wiped from the record and the memories of all who saw it) this film has become iconic and has infected the imaginations of countless filmmakers. Look carefully and you will see its influence in the most unexpected places.\n\nI always thought that one masterpiece is all that anyone can aspire to in life. Wim Wenders has made several but for me this one stands out above all others. My favourite film.",

But the story of Hole drummer Patty Schemel&apos;s rise and fall (OUT of Hole) is beautifully done.\n\nGrowing up in a small town outside Seattle, it wasn&apos;t long before Schemel and her musician brother Larry became regular fixtures in the Seattle music scene. As the city was becoming the focal point for the new &quot;alternative&quot; movement, Patty and her friend Kurt Cobain were indulging in activities a bit more risky than music. Through home footage and interviews with all three band-mates and a who&apos;s who of influential female drummers, Hit So Hard tackles sexism in the music industry, the long and painful process of kicking drugs and the loneliness of being a young lesbian in a conservative town. But by looking at her life from so many facets, the film is ultimately uplifting, moving and powerful. Props to everyone involved. Best SXSW documentary this year.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s around this point that the budget(if not the actual number, then the effort put into making the relatively high amount shine through) and the stakes were raised. The vaults of the ninth, the Copenhagen City Hall Clock in the tenth... and then this one. The gang go to Bruxelles, and there&apos;s no doubt that at least much of it was shot on location. They also hijack a tank. The first of those two expenses begets some hilarious scenes. The plot is quite good, even if the main thing at stake is basically the same as it was last time... Denmark&apos;s fate. Børge returns, though he&apos;s hardly in the film at all. Fie&apos;s pregnant, and some attention is placed upon the fact that Kjeld will be a grandfather, though one is left wondering what happened to the first child of the young couple(then again, this *is* the series of the disappearing kids... just watch the transition from the first film to the second). The pacing is quite intense... not a moment is wasted, though I don&apos;t think I would say that it goes too quickly. Arthur Jensen portrays the meter maid(Parkeringsvagt) that he did in the ninth, in a very brief but irresistibly funny scene. Solveig Sundborg appears for the last time in one of these films. Interestingly enough, she had very small roles in exactly seven of these films... which makes up half of the entire series(if one counts the &apos;98 reunion film, which, I suppose, one should, as painful for us fans as that can be). Edward Fleming shows up again, in a smaller role, though he does have one gag. Bøffen is hardly in the film at all, though his scene is fairly funny(though his death trap isn&apos;t as creative as some of the others seen in the series). As a fun piece of trivia, his character seems to dress slightly differently in each film... new hat, different pieces of footwear and such... but he always wears a blue and white striped shirt with a black leather vest over. Peter Steen has his final role in this film, and with more luck and less of a pitiful overplayed performance than that seen in the three other films(the first three, incidentally) that he appeared in. It&apos;s amusing to see Bjørn Watt-Boolsen - in the role of Bang-Johansen - criticizing Holm Hansens big mouth... the very character he played twice, just a few films back. As my father pointed out while we watched, this seems to have more coups than any of the other entries. The opening scene contains what for my money is the single coolest break-in ever committed to film, at the very least for this franchise. The humor is still going strong, in spite of this not being as funny as the former film... the running gag about the police force&apos;s view on reporters, the Minister&apos;s wife who has a mania to turn out her rooms and the joke pointing out the solemnity of the profession of being a guard all spring to mind. There is poked some fun at the Danes&apos;(and perhaps that of many human beings, in general?) love of good food and beers. The police is parodied, for the umpteenth time. Not much else to say... it&apos;s clear that the series is reaching its end at this point, though there is still some creativity left in Bahs and Balling. An entertaining film in the series, and worth watching for at least a few great sequences. I recommend it to any fan of Olsen-Banden and/or Danish comedy in general. Having seen as many of the other films as possible first is a must. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Slowly I realize what Homer Simpson meant when he said: &quot;I wanna be John Irving!&quot; No, seriously, that was just supposed to be a joke. The ONLY movie I know &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; can be compared to is &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; - as this one based on a novel by John Irving.\n\nSometimes this movie makes you think that it&apos;s a mediocre and senseless one. That it&apos;s gross and abnormal. But that is John Irving! Like in &quot;Garp&quot;, sex plays a central role in &quot;New Hampshire&quot; - and it&apos;s turned upside down. In &quot;Garp&quot;, Glenn Close *raped* a dying man. In this movie, Jodie Foster is raped, she and her brother (Rob Lowe) want to make love and know that they will eventually - and they tell each other. They also tell each other everything about their sexual relationships, they talk about whom they fancy and how they should make love with them. Sex is always present in the development of the characters, but at another level as normally, i.e. as the most normal thing of the world, basically.\n\nThe main reason why that strange movie works is that the characters are very interesting. They are grotesque, alright, but something makes them real. The point is, that the characters in this movie are allowed to dream and even to be really mad. However, there are frontiers to their freedom, it&apos;s just not the same frontiers as we know. They make the frontiers themselves. Their frontiers allow the siblings to make love - on ONE single looong afternoon. And that scene is not as disturbing as it is kind of beautiful and touching, because THESE characters CAN do this! It&apos;s the *radicals* in Vienna who bring us back to the real world - still in a grotesque way. Well, and there are sooo many important characters in this movie - that makes it!\n\nThe actors are fabulous. Jodie Foster can never be bad, Rob Lowe is believeable and Amanda Plummer is as good as always. A real stand-out is young Jennie Dundas. About twelve or how old she was then, she looks so adult in terms. She does not have to hide opposite stars of Jodie Foster&apos;s kind here, she is really great. What she does is make a quite unreal character come to life - quietly but impressive and likeable. Well, it&apos;s no normal movie and there should not be many more of its kind. But, though confusing and gross, there are so many things that you must see. The characters, the actors, the freedom to be mad. Almost as good as &quot;Garp&quot;; there may be worse movies that I rated 8 out of 10.",

None of the characters have a lot of meat on their bones, but the special effects work is solid.\n\nIt&apos;s just a shame that most of the death scenes take place within a 5 minute span towards the end of the movie. It deprives the film of a lot of potential suspense and makes sure that the film is a bit too front loaded with not much going on until the end.",

      "reviewBody": "Guess this sort of stuff just isn&apos;t my cup of tea. There are some weird and odd moments in this filmed &apos;stage&apos; performance of the Greek play The Bacchantes. Not everything made an awful lot of sense to me and that is the reason why to me some of the scene&apos;s were totally impossible to follow, making this movie an almost completely unwatchable one at times.\n\nStill the story is intriguing enough and so is the way it is told. The two main characters are extremely well performed by Will Shepherd and William Finley. The two of them also have some great stage chemistry together.\n\nThe way Brian De Palma cut this movie entirely in split screen makes the story work even better and certainly doesn&apos;t make this movie a boring one to watch. There is always something happening and the split screen help to make the story and scene&apos;s work better since you can obviously show and tell more within 2 screens than in rather just 1 of course.\n\nIt&apos;s an interesting, intriguing and certainly unusual project to watch. This sort of stuff isn&apos;t exactly my idea of having a good and fun time of watching something but it still was a good experience to watch, that certainly does have its moments.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "I am not a great fan of Abhishek but it was this movie that made me to start noticing him seriously. The main storyline is anti-terrorism keeping in line with success of movies like Pukaar, Gadar, Hero etc. \n\nThe main protagonist Abhishek shouldering a failed past is ACP Jai who has been assigned the mission to curb the terrorists and bring them to task. Joining him on this mission is his ex-boss Ajay Devgan in a smaller role as a head-strong and strict disciplinarian miming Al Pacino. He does not have a heroine (good - Bollywood is coming of age!). Bipasha plays Abhishek&apos;s love-interest and is Air-hostess by profession (reason: climax!).\n\nThe action scenes are a definite highlight and do match Hollywood standards.\n\nThe climax is inspired from Air-India hijacking episode and could have been enhanced if Die Hard 2 was made as a bench-mark. What about Abhishek - yes, he is definitely improving. He gives a restrained performance in scenes lamenting of his failed past (reminisces of BigB in Kala Patthar). And Kajol, please take a dentist appointment for your hubby.\n\nTaking into account that its directors debut movie, which is not too bad for a beginner and compared to the shoddy movies pouring in dozens, Zameen does have a few interesting points which make it watchable.\n\nVerdict: A poorly marketed movie which otherwise had good potential."

      "reviewBody": "Hopes were not high coming into Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It is the fourth film in a franchise suffering from diminishing returns, plus it was using the stupid idea of smell-o-vision. And this family film does not disappoint.\n\nMarissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is a top OSS spy who retires after capturing a super villain, Tik Tok, and starts a family with her husband Wilbur (Joel McHale) and stepchildren Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook). A year later a new villain has emerged, the Time Keeper, who speeds up time using the Armageddon Device to punish humanity for wasting time. Marissa is called back by the OSS director, Danger D&apos;Amo (Jeremy Piven), to recapture Tik Tok which should lead them to the Time Keeper. But the Time Keeper sets out to kidnap Rebecca and Cecil because Rebecca has the only thing that could stop the Armageddon Device.\n\nThere are many problems with Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It&apos;s a cheap and unimaginative film where you could easily predict how they would play out. We have seen these story elements so many times before: the dad is a workaholic; there is animosity between step-mum and step-daughter as the step-mum tries to get closer to the children; the revelation of a lie, and so many others. The humour is crude, mostly poo, fart and vomit gags, basically the lowest common denominator which most children will easily outgrow. The other major route of humour is the barrage of puns: time puns, dog puns and smell puns – we&apos;re not stupid! The action is rudimentary; it is easy to expect much better from Robert Rodriguez who just uses poor CGI and quick cuts. And if you can&apos;t guess who the Time Keeper really is then you haven&apos;t seen enough movies. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World feels like it is a movie that is only made for a quick buck, not for any love of the material or the need to tell a good story.\n\nA movie aimed at children should be able to enliven their imaginations: Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is not going to do that. The artificial CGI scenes just look too fake for children to accept and buy into the action and the basic predictable plot will mean that children will not love it. Adults and parents will feel nothing but suffering when watching this movie. This is just a mindless movie with no imagination, which is ironic considering it makes a point that children make better spies because they have more imagination. Children are smart; they ask questions, see plot holes and come up with ideas involving sci-fi concepts. The best family and children&apos;s movies are clever, well-plotted affairs and often have good ideas behind them. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World does not share those traits. Plus this movie carries on the awful trend of spies with babies not working.\n\nMost of the acting is sub-par. The child leads are bland and not natural actors; it&apos;s your typical weak-child acting, and they are no Chloe Mortez or Kodi Smit-McPhee. McHale was truly unconvincing as the father and again a typical bad performance in a bad family movie. Alba was a punch bag for gags to be bounded off on. Ricky Gervais seemed to be having fun, but I&apos;m sure that&apos;s because he got a paycheck for saying bad lines in a recording studio. Piven is much the same, having fun and just being over the top.\n\nAs movie fans we expect better from Rodriguez, who&apos;s done great movies like Sin City, From Dusk to Dawn and the &quot;Mexico&quot; Trilogy. Let&apos;s hope he is doing this movie so we can finally get Sin City 2.\n\nAnd I am sure you are asking the big question – what was the Scratch-and-Sniff card like? It was just a bunch of sickly sweet smells and simply just a gimmick. But you already knew that.",

This movie was mad cute, it is based an a story of Greek mythology and takes place in the hood of Miami. Trina place Alicia a girl who wants to end the street violence and make their home safe. This is actually quite a positive movie and Trina shows great skills in acting. The only thing keeping this movie from more stars is a couple minor actors really are bad at acting...but Trina and the rest of the majors are really good.

A lot of scenes disapeared: The face from Alecta, two times that the antiquaire appears in the film. I remember it was another end too, or maybe I&apos;m wrong? Was ever the last scene a close of Jan&apos;s eye? Where is a complete copy of this film? It&apos;s very sad this cutting of scenes."

As I sit here and think about it now, I realize that our appreciation for this film had probably very little to do with the fundamentals of good movie-making (ex: acting, direction, musical score), but can instead be attributed to the fact that it displays friendship in one of its purest forms.  The film is an illustrated test of loyalty, and what being friends as an adolescent is all about.  It made me appreciate my best friend that much more, and in the end, I left class feeling a little bit better about being a kid.",

I knew the plot of the story and wondered how he would portray feelings of sadness and regret with a permanent smile carved on his face.  After viewing the tape, we were amazed how the emotions exuded from the TV screen.  This is our second Mary Philbin experience and both of us prefer her acting in this movie to her role in The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nWe have viewed silents on the TV screen as well as the big screen.  We discovered that there is more of the &quot;larger than life&quot; emotions projected and felt by the audience through the larger screenings that is somewhat missed on the 27&quot; TV screen.  Not so with this performance.  My wife and I were both moved to watch it from the beginning...one more time."

Later she calls him inviting for a drink, and he finds an unstable and decadent actress living in her past success. In a mixed sensation of love, empathy and curiosity, Robert has an affair with Veronika, and discloses a dangerous gang leaded by Dr. Marianne Katz (Annemarie Düringer) that addicts wealthy patients in morphine to get their fortune when they die.\n\n&quot;Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss&quot; is a melancholic, bitter and depressive tale based on the reality of an era, and the association with &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; is immediate. The story is based on the last years of the German actress Sybille Schmitz (1909-1955), who died due to an overdose of sleeping pills. The performance of Rosel Zech is impressive, showing the glamour of a former star in the Nazi period and the depression of an addicted woman in the 50&apos;s. Hilmar Thate is also perfect in the role of a simple innocent man that faces a greedy world of pain and death. The magnificent cinematography in black and white, using perfectly light and shadows, is homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Desespero de Veronika Voss&quot; (&quot;The Despair of Veronika Voss&quot;)",

Sometimes they can just simply be small gentle films that tell their story with heartfelt sincerity, humor and warmth. `Ziemassvetku Jampadracis&apos; is such a film. `Jampadracis&apos; tells the story of the Cirulisi, a tight knit family down on their luck, and their trials and tribulations during the Christmas season. Father Cirulitis has just been turned down for a job as a music teacher. He can barely support the family as a piano teacher with far too few students. They can&apos;t even afford a Christmas tree. The landlord is threatening to kick them out. The kids have just received their report cards and some of the marks are not, well, they are not the kind that you would want your parents to see. The eldest son has been summoned to the police station falsely accused of hitting a policeman with a snowball. And, to top it all off the child prodigy that the two youngest kids have been entrusted with entertaining has just been injured on the eve of his concert, for which they are sure to be blamed. What ensues is a story that is as genuine as it is warm. A wonderful tale that transcends whatever weaknesses it might have simply because it is told from the heart. The Cirulisi might be poor and going through hard times, but the love that they have for each other can triumph over anything that comes their way. In contrast, the family of the child prodigy, which has all the wealth and status that anyone could possibly need, seems lost and sad because they lack precisely the one thing that the Cirulisi have been blessed with. The winner of several awards,  among them Chicago&apos;s and Frankfurt&apos;s children&apos;s film festivals, `Jampadracis&apos; might be characterized as a children&apos;s film, but it is a film for the child in all of us. It transcends the genre. The performances do not contain a single false note and Varis Braslas direction and the script by Alvis Lapins are exemplary.",

The most interesting thing is perhaps how the two actors handle their roles: Sordi is very calm, controlled and &quot;normal&quot;, while Gassman just can&apos;t stop being nervous, shouting and gesticulating all the time.\n\nJust like La Vita è Bella, this movie&apos;s purpose is to blame the horrors of war as well as making you laugh as much as you can.\n\nFor those who like Italian cinema, La Grande Guerra is a must-see.",

      "reviewBody": "I liked this a lot. It seemed that the series strove to maintain a neutral point of view in regard to the causes and/or futility of the war while maintaining focus on the individuals they profiled, and in my opinion they largely succeeded. Unlike a previous reviewer, I did not find it to be overly narcissistic, pro-war, or even all that pro-American, though the focus was definitely on the American experience. Some time was also devoted to other factors, such as life for the families back home, protests and movements, and U.S. administration positions on the war at various points, though the main focus remained with the progress of the war and the battlefields themselves. \n\nLeaving the controversies aside, I thought that what the series tried to do -- portray the experiences of various individuals at certain key places and events in the war -- they did quite well. I also liked the graphics and illustrations and, as opposed to other documentaries I have seen, I thought that these were distributed well and did not get in the way of the real story. The CGI stuff was good and not overdone, in my opinion.\n\nThe thing about Vietnam is that once you start discussing the controversies and what we now know to be untruths, it is a discussion without end, full of passion and short on facts, not because of the people discussing it but because the whole thing was based upon a twenty year series of lies and deceptions on the part of the governments involved. Wherever there are lies there will always be arguments, and the subject of the Vietnam war is proof positive of this on a massive scale. This series did not attempt to take any of that on, and wisely so. Though at times I found this irritating -- for instance, the neutral announcement of the events in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 as legal cause for Johnson&apos;s escalation, when we now know that at least one of the incidents never happened -- I could recognize it as necessary in telling the story. If they had taken on any one of the many controversies or governmental lies, it would have been a quicksand from which the series would not have recovered. I&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t! \n\nIt is good to remember that many of those fighting were not volunteers but draftees: it was a federal charge and prison time to dodge the draft. In that light, I do not think that talk of honor and duty is narcissistic or out of place: many did not choose the war, but were sent by force. These went in service to their *country* -- if not the war itself -- and acquitted themselves on a personal level largely with great honor, regardless of the legitimacy of the war or their belief in it. Many times in the series you hear the soldiers referring to the war as a lost cause, and yet they gave their lives for it, if only because that was what they personally felt was the honorable thing to do. I believe that this *personal* honor, courage and heroism on an *individual* level is what this series was trying to bring out, and I think it succeeded very well.\n\nI enjoyed this series in spite of its neutral point of view, and I think it was very nicely done given the incredibly controversial nature of the war and its premises. While I would NOT recommend this series as a primer on Vietnam, nor even a good outline or overview -- you&apos;d be better off going to Wikipedia for that -- it did very well with what it tried to do, and it&apos;s well worth a watch if wartime documentaries are something you like. Enjoy!"

      "reviewBody": "This little gem may represent the last gasp of healthy symbiotic intersection between pure art and the world of commerce, a centuries old tradition that died with the rise of corporate supremacy in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nHenry Geldzahler is lovingly memorialized by world class artists Frank Stella, Jasper Johns, David Hockney and others. Born into a wealthy family of Belgian diamond merchants, Geldzahler transcended his illustrious materialistic roots to inject himself as a potent and active force in the world of modern art. A maverick assistant curator at New York&apos;s Metropolitan Museum, Geldzahler was prescient enough to recognize the future of art and instrumental in establishing America&apos;s modern artists as a force to be reckoned with. \n\nGeldzahler stands primarily as an example of someone who was born into incredible privilege, yet used his social advantage as but a starting point for a career that influenced American culture at the highest intellectual level.\n\nTestimony to his importance lies in the multitude of flattering portraits of Geldzahler completed by the greatest American artists of his era, many of whom appear in this documentary to lend oral tribute to him as well.\n\nWhile Geldzahler&apos;s story makes this a must see for anyone interested in the arts (particularly Modern American art) or in the depiction of a brilliantly realized upper class life, the most precious clips are those showing Geldzahler&apos;s friends at their best: Andy Warhol&apos;s brief but trenchant observations are well worth sitting through this on their own, and Frank Stella&apos;s comments brilliantly illuminate the state of the arts in 50s and 60s America, and Geldzahler&apos;s place in that scene. \n\nAnyone interested in the arts will appreciate Geldzahler&apos;s incredible ability to recognize art at its inception, years before the slugs of Middle American society were able to grasp its significance, and only with the aid of forward-thinking guides like Geldzahler to explain it.\n\nGeldzahler was that rarest of species: a person who could have easily coasted through life on the coat-tails of his ancestors, fat and happy on the dregs of their accomplishments, yet rose beyond their limitations to affect the course of art history by recognizing and supporting worthy and brilliant artists who may otherwise have been overlooked, with no social or political agenda to affect his artistic judgments.\n\nGeldzahler represents the last of an extinct breed. Uncorrupted and uncompromised, he intersected with the creative community in a way that is impossible even for the most powerful of today&apos;s media moguls, who ultimately must answer to their brainless corporate uberlords. \n\nArt lovers should watch this, and appreciate that there was a time when art for art&apos;s sake had its champions, and wealthy educated patrons were as pure of heart as the artists they championed. \n\nArtists will watch it, and wish they had been born when Geldzahler still walked the earth.",

Director Nicolas Rossier tells the story of Haiti&apos;s struggle for independence in his brilliant feature documentary. Interviews with leaders on both sides of the fence and historical background going back to the French conquest weave a compelling and well-balanced narrative. &quot;ARISTIDE and the Endless Revolution&quot; is a must see for anyone interested in how politics, human rights, and justice can be manipulated and undermined. You&apos;ll walk away from this film wondering how the world can just stand by and watch.",

The movie is extremely poetic, but at the same time, the visuals are firmly grounded in reality and the buzzing of insects in the outdoors is omnipresent. The plot is simple: a student is spending a summer back in his home village, taking care of his grandfather on his deathbed while dealing with his own &quot;growing up&quot;. The movie allegedly contains the most erotic scene in Czechoslovak cinema - when the youngster watches a woman bathing in the river.\n\nThe title translates into English as &quot;A Romance for Fluegelhorn&quot;.

Well, I thought it was at first. But when I watched it in numerous reruns, I began to like this. Christopher Reeve excellently reprises his role, alongside comedy favorite Richard Pryor, as a computer-whiz, who is hired by his boss to help fulfill his plans for world domination. Pryor may not do it right sometimes, but he&apos;s admittedly hilarious in spots. But painfully ridiculous in some. \n\nAmong the things that make it a bit unsatisfying for critics is the lack of the characters from the originals. Lois lane had to go on vacation, so Lana Lang (played well by Annette O&apos;Toole)is Superman&apos;s/Clark Kent&apos;s love interest. Robert Vaughn plays a sinister mastermind, an okay replacement for the famous villain Lex Luther. What some viewers don&apos;t understand is that director Richard Lester wants it to be more of a comic book adventure rather than what scriptwriter Mario Puzo did in the first two. \n\nRating: **1/2 out of 5.",

      "reviewBody": "This four-hour sprawl and slice-of-America docu-fiction bears obvious comparison to Kramer&apos;s earlier &apos;Milestones&apos;, though it doesn&apos;t function as a sequel as such. &apos;Milestones&apos; gave us a constantly-rotating cast, through whose various storylines played out the collective dreams of revolution, activism, communal living, as things both held onto and slowly abandoned by a white middle-class emerging back into the class mantle which they&apos;d temporarily left behind. In &apos;Route One&apos;, which traverses the entirety of the titular road from top to tail, we instead have a central figure-&apos;Doc&apos; (Paul McIsaac), who McIsaac described as a kind of fusion of his and Kramer&apos;s characters, and who here serves as a travelling companion for the behind-camera Kramer himself. Doc first appears as character in &apos;Doc&apos;s Kingdom&apos; two years previously, where it&apos;s suggested that he had a revolutionary past as a member of the Weather Underground and, upon leaving the states, in situations alluded to briefly here, became involved as a doctor in various revolutionary situations in Africa. Like Doc, Kramer returned to the States after a period of some years in Europe to make the film (though unlike Doc, he didn&apos;t settle). And Doc/Kramer are now jaded, morose, bemused, sometimes amused-a relation to America not that of forging a new sense of collective being within it (one connected to often romanticised notions of &apos;tribes&apos;, dropping out and the like) but as an individual standing on the outside: the individual now rendered a &apos;foreigner&apos; in the midst of his homeland. In conversation with Frederick Wismenan, Kramer used the &apos;foreigner&apos; metaphor to describe the situations that unfold in the film, where an actor is placed in a &apos;real life&apos; event (say, a Pat Robertson fundraiser); for Kramer, the ease with which the two could be integrated suggested that the American popular relation to representation had changed, conscious or unconscious notions of acting and performance (particularly as they relate to being filmed) altered through the ubiquity, not only of commercial cinema, but of television. To challenge the traditional division between fiction film and documentary-which Kramer sees as arbitrary-is thus not only a formal claim, but an assertion about the nature of social relations as the Cold War ground to its close, in which &apos;image&apos; has become a &apos;way of life&apos;. Here, fixed in place by codes of race, class and gender, one is always &apos;playing one&apos;s self&apos;. To set up these situations, the conceit of Doc and Kramer&apos;s journey down the road at a time of political campaigning -a journey whose contours are arbitrary yet precise. While &apos;Milestones&apos; has elements of the road movie-notably, the couple who try to make the transition from life on a commune to an urban job and house-&apos;Route One&apos; takes both the cross-sectional methodology and the rootlessness of the genre as its raison d&apos;etre. Certainly, it must be one of the longest road movies in film history; the road, not as escape, celebration of speed, doomed romanticism, and so on, but as a standing to the side, observing. For a film with such a wealth of incident, the overall mood is subdued, melancholic: the clear gains made by the political right and the absence of viable sources of living together that don&apos;t simply blame the marginalised or play out through the capitalist nexus are registered with what one critics calls a &apos;long sigh&apos;-and inequality and moral hypocrisy is didactically illustrated through one of the film&apos;s best sequences, juxtaposing a teenage newly-wed who falls foul of the judicial system with the wealthy lawyer wandering his estate and talking about the need to maintain a work-life balance (because, if he kept the class immiseration he sees in his day job &quot;in my mind, I would literally go out of my mind&quot;). Yet, once he reaches Florida, Doc eventually gains some sense of possibility through community work with marginalised groups: like the characters in &apos;Milestones&apos;, trying to find a way to settle down, to resolve the sense of wandering, exile and the inability to overhaul society as such through revolutionary means with the possibilities for more local, patient, yet perhaps no less valuable modes of change-or perhaps, in the case of his patients, simply survival.",

Viewed as such it&apos;s not a bad marital comedy though if one is expecting certain Hitchcock touches they won&apos;t be there. \n\nRobert Montgomery and Carole Lombard are a constantly spatting married couple. They love each other, but to them arguing is like exercise. In a moment of oneupsmanship Montgomery answers in the affirmative to a question by Lombard as to whether he&apos;d marry her if he had to do it all over again.\n\nHis words come back to haunt him when Charles Halton from Lombard&apos;s hometown in Idaho and says that because of a technicality they&apos;re not legally married. Montgomery spends the rest of the film trying to win Lombard back. \n\nSome of the best movie comedies have been made on a premise flimsier than this one. Mr.&amp;Mrs. Smith is not the best of comedies, but it is far from the worst.\n\nI have a feeling that Alfred Hitchcock may have had Lombard in mind for future projects more of his own taste. I can see her easily in some of his later films. Lombard was only 32 when she died. \n\nPity we&apos;ll never know.",

And in the case of this silly, cheesy, predictable movie, I got my comedy with a dash of heart-warmth.\n\nI like Toby Keith -- he&apos;s kinda hot. And I love to listen to him talk. Rodney Carrington is one of the funniest, most talented people out there. And for both of them to be a in movie together -- I was pleased. I laughed my butt off at some of the gags.\n\nI think my favorite part, however, was Ted Nugent as Skunk.

Moreover, the plot follows much the same formula as previous entries. Indeed it rather resembles Mark of the Gorilla, with crocodiles substituting for the apes. But though the dialogue is stilted and the situations familiar, the juvenile audience this movie is intended to please, will probably not notice. In fact the story moves at such a fast clip, it makes for a reasonably exciting diversion. Naturally, production values are helped along by a few stock shots from previous Jungle Jim entries (such as the eagle, and the underwater fight with the croc), plus quite a few clips from Columbia&apos;s library of ancient stock footage (the elephants). It all makes for plenty of action, including a fairly exciting climax. Johnny Weissmuller is his usual competent self whilst the heroine, an attractive lass, will fascinate the older boys in the audience. Unfortunately, the rest of the support players are an undistinguished lot, easily outclassed by that talented chimp, Kimba (even if he obviously doesn&apos;t really cut the prisoners free). Sholem&apos;s direction is reasonably proficient, though it provides only an occasional flash of imagination (such as the menacing crocodile shadow in the cave). The sets, however, are mighty impressive.",

      "reviewBody": "Any glutton who loves awful movies has sat through dozens of inherently unwatchable films in the hopes of finding the rare beast that is both completely un-viewable and completely awesome at the same time. While Snuff leans more ardently toward the former, the current DVD presentation of this film helps this deservedly obscure classic drift a bit toward the latter.\n\nLet&apos;s clarify that this film wasn&apos;t intended to be passed off as an actual &quot;snuff&quot; film. If such a genre truly existed, which we won&apos;t debate here since we&apos;re clearly talking about a film that is NOT a &quot;snuff&quot; movie, chances are it would look a bit more like the footage hinted at in Mute Witness or 8mm than a carefully edited multi-camera affair with dubbed audio and generous arrays of stock Carnavale footage. If anyone ever truly believed that filmmakers murdered someone on camera and surrounded that footage with a pseudo-story about biker chicks who kill random people in surprisingly un-bloody ways, somehow found a way to bypass all of those dicey regulations concerning murder and its illegalites, and found a distributor to get a theatrical release for said footage... Seriously, no one did. I promise you.\n\nYes, this movie is tedious, far too long, and so ineptly made that I can not find a single reason to recommend it. To normal people, that is. However, if you actually know what this film is, and still have any interest in seeing it, then you kind of need to, because it is as wretched an example of film-making as you could ever hope to encounter. Scene after scene, it is a shining an example of crappy C-grade schlock. But, you know, some of us really love crappy C-grade schlock.\n\nWe don&apos;t want good dubbing, quality special effects, or actors who had heard of the phenomenon of &quot;acting&quot; before the cameras were turned on them. We aren&apos;t concerned with continuity, character development, or coherent story structure. We simply want to spend 80 minutes of our life watching something that vaguely resembles a film, yet ends up being an hour and twenty minute exercise in incredulity that forces us to question what&apos;s wrong with us for enjoying something that is clearly so un-enjoyable.\n\nThis film is a joke. And one would suspect that the film-makers knew this. Now, the reason that Snuff is awesome is that not only did a piece of unwatchable trash like this gain some level of infamy, but 30 years later, there is a reasonably intelligent person sitting at their computer typing this missive at 3:33 in the morning, and another one reading said missive because they have yet to view this film.\n\nIgnore what you&apos;ve heard about the grand guignol finale of this film, because it truly is a disturbing bit of nastiness. The fact that it follows such a laughably bad precursor is probably the point of this entire affair. And kudos to Blue Underground for presenting this film as they did, in a package without cover art, synopsis, or special features, which, contrary to the numerous criticisms of this I&apos;ve read, captures this film perfectly. If you would really want a Criterion Collection pressing of Snuff, then you are clearly missing the point.\n\nFans of terrible movies won&apos;t find one much more primitive than this (although I&apos;d also tip my hat to The Last Slumber Party). If that sounds appealing to you, then you will thoroughly enjoy Snuff. If not, I really have to question what you thought you were in store for when you popped in a non-existent-budget South American film from the &apos;70s called &quot;Snuff&quot;.\n\nDo I recommend this? No, absolutely not. But do I own it and love the fact I own it? I kind of have to...",

      "reviewBody": "Having been stationed at Tempelhof Central Airport in the 1980s, this movie had particular significance. The book is a difficult read--full of legal terminology and political machinations, but in short--the story of a Jewish judge, sent to Berlin not-so-many years after WWII to try East Germans for hijacking an aircraft to freedom in the West. The movie misses a lot of the subtleties, but is detailed enough to give a good picture of the political climate at the time. A federal prosecutor, Judge Stern was selected to head this trial after many other judges resisted taking on this political &quot;hot potato&quot;. The theory is that a Jewish judge in post-war Germany would go along with what was originally envisioned as a sort of &quot;sham&quot; trial intended to lead directly to convictions. Stern insisted that the defendants receive, according to the American Constitution, a trial by a jury of their peers --fellow Germans. An interesting concept for our country, which offically occupied West Berlin until the 1990s. Could conquerors try the conquered in occupied territory with a jury of their (conquered) peers? For anyone who is cynical of our position in the world arena as the unofficial &quot;watchdog&quot; of freedoms, this is a wonderful drama showing that justice will, if given the chance, win out. Highly recommended for anyone interested in our legal system or our nation&apos;s post-WWII history.",

Being used to 90 minute films I was worried about the length of Bollywood films, yet I didn&apos;t hardly notice the time.\n\nThe film captured my attention, partly due to Ash Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, both were captivating and carried the story. I even have the songs in my head still...and that only happens occasionally.\n\nI don&apos;t know much about Indian culture but I did enjoy getting to see something un-American, to the point of deciding that maybe I should stick to World Cinema rather than Hollywood.\n\nPersonally I will be watching it many more times and encourage anyone who hasn&apos;t seen it yet to get a move on!",

Calvin creates a very similar relationship, to his last, with a woman who appears after he writes about her. It is a movie about their struggles as he attempts to create his perfect relationship by changing it on paper. It is a beautifully written story. Most movies today are about the special effects and don&apos;t have enough of the story. This movie is full of story and a great one. You will leave the movie theater feeling like you just watched a really great movie! Must see! This is what movie making should be about.",

His small Spartan apartment is filled with file cabinets holding all his negatives. He doesn&apos;t care about money. He and his friend Editta Sherman are getting evicted. At his core, he is obsessed with fashion and photographing the changing style in New York. It&apos;s a fascinating portrait. It also doesn&apos;t shy away from the obvious personal questions. It comes later in the movie just as the lack of personal life starts to be prominent. It reveals the real person behind the camera.",

      "reviewBody": "This is, at times, a very confusing movie. It can be forgiven for that - because clearly it&apos;s intended to be. The opening scenes of the movie (a group of illegal immigrants apparently attempting to cross into the US from Mexico) are a bit disorienting. They don&apos;t seem to fit with what you expect the movie to be about (I even questioned briefly to myself whether the video store had accidentally packed the wrong movie into the case!) Once it gets going, though, it&apos;s compelling.\n\nBasically, the story revolves around the search for the person who assassinated a US Senator, with the prime suspect being a Soviet agent who everyone believed had been killed years before. So - yes - it was an interesting way of bringing back a sort of Cold War theme to a movie made more than 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. There are two experts on this Russian agent known as Cassius: CIA agent Shepherdson (Richard Gere) and FBI agent Geary (Topher Grace). They get put together as a team to try to piece the puzzle together. The first twist to the story comes about a half hour through the movie, which leaves you wondering a bit what the point of the movie is, but there&apos;s a later twist that was (to me, at least) unexpected. It&apos;s pretty well done. Gere and Grace worked pretty well together. I haven&apos;t really seen much of Topher Grace since he was the star of &quot;That 70&apos;s Show.&quot; He&apos;s matured a great deal as an actor.\n\nThere are some pretty good action scenes in this, but to its credit the movie doesn&apos;t go overboard on action. It tends to focus mostly on the relationship between Shepherdson and Geary. It&apos;s a pretty decent effort. (7/10)",

But the psycho killer character and the unusual production style are what keep the momentum and interest in this movie going. I found elements of &quot;The Cell&quot;, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and &quot;Saw&quot; all wrapped in one. The quirky style of many scenes in the movie has elements of Tim Burton and &quot;Puppet Master&quot;. The creepy and astounding score also lend major points to an otherwise average horror thriller story. The movie was genuinely creepy and somewhat scary at several moments, but scary in a suspenseful way and not so much a frightening way. With the slew of horrible horror movies, high budgets and low, this one definitely stands out as above average and unique in it&apos;s own way. If you can get past the amateurish acting of the two young leads and the low budget aspects of the film that are apparent here and there, you will find a fantastic and gripping horror movie.",

      "reviewBody": "A convoy of angry and enraged truckers are rolling down the desert highways of Arizona New Mexico and Texas led by Martin Penwald (Kris Kistofferson) using the CB-handle &quot;Rubber Duck&quot;. The truckers had enough of the corrupt highway cops who shake them down and threaten to impound their rigs. Leaving the truckers without any means of financial support. As well as the ridicules 55 MPH speed limit on the highways that cuts into their time and earnings and last but not least the sky-rocketing gas prices. \n\nAfter the Rubber Duck and two of his trucker pals Love Machine &amp; Spider Mike,Burt Young &amp; Franklyn Ajaye, were entrapped by the nasty and vindictive local Sheriff Lyle Wallace, Earnest Borgnine,for illegally using the trucker CB-handle name Cottonmouth. Their shaken down by the &quot;lawman&quot; for $70.00 each in order to avoid having their trucks impounded and them being thrown behind bars.\n\nThe three later Going to the local truck stop to celebrate the Rubber Ducks birthday and have a few drinks are again confronted by the lawman. Sheriff Wallace, still not satisfied with pushing the truckers around, comes snooping around the area to make a few more bucks off the abused haulers. Wallace picks on poor Spider Mike accusing him of loitering and is about to throw him in jail. Spiker Mike pleads to the unfeeling Wallace that his wife is about to give birth and to please leave him alone which doesn&apos;t move the sheriff at all. But a straight right to his jaw, by Spider Mike, does make him move right on the butt of his pants. In a bar brawl with the truckers, who come to the aid of Spider Mike Love Machine and the Rubber Duck, Wallace and two of his deputies are knocked out cold and handcuffed as the three truckers together with the Rubber Duck&apos;s new found squeeze the plucky and outspoken Melissa (Ali MacGraw), a wedding photographer who&apos;s car broke down, then take off and go back on the road again with the entire Arizona Highway Patrol on their tail. \n\nChased by the crazy Sheriff Wallace, who commandeered a car from a young couple smoking and shearing a joint. the Rubber Duck Love Machine &amp; Spider Mike get the full support from some very expected and unexpected persons that during the remainder of the film has them on the front pages of the news as well as getting the ear of the local governors senators and even the President of the United States himself. \n\nThere&apos;s strength in numbers is the theme of &quot;Convoy&quot; with the Rubber Duck &amp; friends making a private affair into a public happening. This by drawing attention to the plight of him and his fellow truckers and how their short-changed and ill-treated by everyone down the line, police politicians and big oil, as they try to do their.\n\nThe giant convoy of truckers following the Rubber Duck open the eyes of the nation and puts corrupt low-lives like Sheriff Wallace on the front pages. All that showed what these hard working and dedicated men, the truckers, have to put up with every day and night that their on the road. In the end they get the support and respect from the public, as well as the politicians, that they so richly deserve. When the clueless and almost brain-dead politicians see the endless line of the trucker convoy lead by the Rubber Duck they not only stand up and listen but they deliver as well. \n\nOne of director Sam Peckinpah&apos;s most underrated films that, as far as I could see, had no one killed in it. Even though the amount of violence and explosions were equaled to Peckinpah&apos;s famous blood-splattering 1969 classic &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.",

It is a classic text-book example of colonialist paternalism captured on film, both in subjects and supporting dialog. It is certainly not poorly done, and I can recommend it as viewable for educational purposes about colonialism in school viewings. Funny thing how only a few years later the &apos;rock-solid stability of the everlasting Congolese colony&apos; was turned into a half-dozen years of instability and brutal civil war. Shows you how completely blind they were in Belgian governmental and cultural circles at that time.",

It wants to record as accurately as possible what it was like to be one of the soldiers under fire on that mission. Hour by hour, step by step, it reconstructs the chain of events. \n\nThe director Elkhan Jafarov avoids the bright colors of upbeat combat movies, and its drab, dusty tones gradually drain of light as night falls. The later scenes of the movie feel chilly and forlorn; the surrounded troops are alone and endangered in the night.\n\nFor all of its gritty war action, the film&apos;s characters remain passionate, but its patriotic ending fails to mitigate the military incompetence on display.\n\nFilms like this are more useful than gung-ho capers like &quot;Behind Enemy Lines.&quot; They help audiences understand and sympathize with the actual experiences of combat troops, instead of trivializing them into entertainments.",

As far as thrillers goes, this is as good as it gets. The acting is great and it&apos;s good to see Matthew Settle in a staring role. He has movie star quality and works great in this one. The narration is broken up and consists of flashbacks which adds to the building of tension. The movie is shot in studios in Sweden and the exterior in New York. The sets are just great and you could never guess that the movie isn&apos;t made on location in New York. If you like fast pacing slick thrillers then you should catch this one.",

The entire cast delivered strong performances. Gerard Butler was a magnificent Beowulf ... emoting the torment of his soul with tender subtlety yet never compromising the intrinsic brutality and strength vital to his character. The story, modified from its original literary version to adapt to a contemporary audience, was profoundly relevant to today&apos;s political and social climate. A pleasant surprise in the film is the clever use of unexpected wit and wry humour. If you enjoy a film that will make you think ... this one is for you. natalie(GB.net)",

      "reviewBody": "Big Clint&apos;s first film outside of Serigo Leone&apos;s sensational Dollars trilogy is none other than...a Western. Hang &apos;Em High is a rather overlooked entry in Clint&apos;s long and impressive film wagon, even though it is a serious, no-nonsense and modest look at crime and punishment and a subtle dig at the injustice system, which was somewhat forgotten by his critics who emphasized that he was a symbol of violence, especially in the Dollars trilogy and the Dirty Harry series.\n\nClint plays an ex-lawman who picks up a new badge after he is almost killed by a group of men who hang him and leave him for dead. He then embarks on a mission to hunt them down one-by-one and hand them over to the law.\n\nTed Post&apos;s watchable Western drama is definitely a refreshing break from most other &apos;revenge&apos; movies. Instead of cold-blooded vengeance, the script decides to display Clint&apos;s character, though still as the cold, silent anti-hero, as a more peaceful person who would truly like to see men behind bars rather than shooting them down. The film also keeps it grip, rarely letting a boring moment crawl in even though this is more talk than action.\n\nIts not a perfect, polished or particularly great film - the characterization always stays pretty low and the romance between Clint and the charming Inger Stevens isn&apos;t fully developed, for instance. However, it has its highlights - a memorable opening sequence and an effective musical score - along with its notable touch for seeing justice rather than violence and killing. A good effort that&apos;s worth watching and not ignoring.",

I wouldn&apos;t call this a horror movie so much as a strange combination of fantasy and gore, but it fits my Halloween bill well enough. The Wizard of Gore doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense, but then, like Phantasm, it isn&apos;t really supposed to.\n\nThere is a 2007 remake of this around, and I might just be inclined to check it out, to see what modern film-making could do for this little gem..."

      "reviewBody": "I was wary of purchasing Fantoma&apos;s 2-Disc Set of &quot;Fritz Lang&apos;s Indian Epic&quot; after being somewhat let down by the 1921 Silent original (co-scripted by Lang himself) and also its less-than-stellar reputation. For this reason, when the second part of the saga turned up on Italian TV a couple of years ago, I decided to check it out just the same so as to get an inkling of what to expect! I recall thinking it pretty kitschy and unworthy of Lang&apos;s enormous talent, but Fantoma&apos;s sale (through their website) of their entire DVD catalog a few months back made it an irresistible acquisition! Well, having now watched the entire saga (with dialogue and in color, as opposed to the rather static Silent version directed by Joe May - although hearing the Indian-garbed characters talking in German took some getting used to), I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely engaging and sheerly enjoyable it all was! Though it was sold as an epic production (to the point of concluding ESCHNAPUR with the promise that Part II would feature greater thrills and even more spectacle) at a time when such films were all the rage, the saga was actually a pretty modest undertaking by eclectic (and prolific) German producer Artur Brauner. Despite the two films&apos; exotic, handsome look (not least in the provocative dances of Debra Paget), the budgetary constraints were painfully obvious in the special effects department, especially the hilarious appearance of a &apos;ropey&apos; cobra which is intended to &apos;test&apos; (the scantily-clad) Miss Paget&apos;s faithfulness to the Maharajah!! All in all, even if these films hardly constitute Lang&apos;s greatest work (though he harbored an evident affection throughout his life for this particular tale, which was originally conceived by his former wife Thea von Harbou), they have great - and enduring - appeal for aficionados of old-fashioned, serial-like adventure stories tinged with romance and mysticism.\n\nEven so, while I don&apos;t subscribe to that school of thought myself, there are some film critics (Tom Gunning, Jean Douchet and Pierre Rissient among them) who think very highly of Lang&apos;s Indian diptych - the first considering it one of Lang&apos;s towering achievements and the last two numbering it among the ten greatest films of all time!!",

      "reviewBody": "Baronnessen fra Benzintanken is a Danish comedy film directed by Annelise Reenberg, released in 1960. The story follows the widow Baroness Alvilda von Rosensten (played by Maria Garland) who, after the death of her only son Jørgen, finds out that her estate is about to be taken over by her arch-rivals Clarissa Rabenfeldt (Erni Arneson) and her son Henning Rabenfeldt (Henrik Wiehe). However, when the family lawyer discovers a letter written by Helene Tofte, it is revealed that Jørgen had a child born out of wedlock, making that child the rightful heir to the estate. The baroness sends the lawyer to find the child, who turns out to be a beautiful young woman named Anne Tofte (Ghita Nørby) living with her uncle Lars Tofte (Ove Sprogøe) and his friend Hans Høj (Dirch Passer) at a gas station in Rønby. The story follows the family as Anne is brought to the estate and introduced to the household and the various conflicts that arise.\n\nThe film has a fun and light-hearted tone and is well-acted by the cast, particularly Ghita Nørby, Dirch Passer, and Ove Sprogøe, who are noted for outshining the rest of the cast. The story is less important than the informal family dynamic and the humorous situations that arise from it. While the film drags a little at times, it is an enjoyable watch overall. A shorter runtime of 15 minutes might have benefited the film. Overall, I would rate Baronnessen fra Benzintanken 7 out of 10 stars.",

The difference is that this one&apos;s an Israeli entry in the genre, and it&apos;s technically a student film, given that it&apos;s the product of a thesis project. Sadly, it&apos;s as dumb and derivative as any other zombie B-movie of recent years you could mention, with the different setting doing little to assuage feelings of familiarity and boredom.\n\nThe &apos;heroes&apos; are a group of Israeli soldiers battling the undead. The action is cheaply staged throughout; there&apos;s a lot of it, but with none of the expert choreography you&apos;d hope for in this type of film. Indeed, it all seems rather slapdash. It is quite gory, although the cheesy CGI blood spray effects look like they were created on the director&apos;s brother-in-law&apos;s laptop.\n\nThe cast is pretty weak and the characters remain unlikeable throughout. The unusual setting is in this film&apos;s favour, but politics is kept strictly to the background here in favour of your routinely staged zombie action scenes. Israel needs to do better than this if it wants to make its mark on the horror scene.",

      "reviewBody": "Playing the title role in The Lincoln Lawyer is Matthew McConaughey so nicknamed because he conducts most of his business from his Lincoln Town Car which is chauffeured by Laurence Mason. As he has to travel to and from various courts, this makes it a whole easier. And the car and Mason thereby become a business expense. Roy Cohn would have been proud.\n\nMcConaughey is no idealist, his services come at a price. But it turns out he has some scruples and they are put to the test when rich boy Ryan Phillippe and his mother Frances Fisher hire him to defend Ryan when he&apos;s arrested for rape. He was literally caught in the act as two neighbors broke in and held him for the cops for raping Marguerite Levieva. \n\nDue to the canons of the Bar Association ethics McConaughey finds himself in a jackpot similar to the one Al Pacino found himself when he played a young idealistic lawyer in And Justice For All. But the results are a whole lot different because McConaughey is not an idealist and he makes those canons work for him.\n\nThe film looks like the pilot of a TV series, but I doubt we&apos;ll get any of the big name stars there if such a thing comes to pass. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey&apos;s ex-wife and a prosecutor to boot. Can&apos;t imagine what broke that marriage up. William H. Macy has a key role in this film as well as a private investigator who works for McConaughey and does very well in it.\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer is a very well done addition to the legal cinema with a cast that fills its roles out to a &quot;T&quot;. I would really recommend renting the Al Pacino classic And Justice For All and see the very great similarities and key differences in both of these films.",

      "reviewBody": "A stranger (Anthony Hopkins) attempts to convince a happily married couple that their daughter (Susan Swift) is actually his daughter reincarnated.\n\nThe film mixes horror and religion, but the typical Catholic religion of the horror tradition. Here it is Hinduism, with all the good and bad that can come of reincarnation. The movie even uses a quotation from the Bhagavad-Gita: &quot;There is no end. For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does it ever cease to be. It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval.&quot; This very much sums up the tone of the film.\n\nThe film has been called a ripoff of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and given it is the story of a girl in the 1970s who may have the spirit / soul of another inside her, that may be a fair assessment. New York Times critic Vincent Canby went through every effort to draw parallels between the two.\n\nIn contrast, English professor Adrian Schober wrote that the film &quot;is more a reaction to and reworking of The Exorcist than a &apos;rip-off&apos;, minus the sensationalism, special effects and vulgarity.&quot; This is more fair, because for those not watching the film in the 1970s, it may not be obvious how much this film could be compared to the &quot;Exorcist&quot;.\n\nComparisons aside, we get some good acting from Susan Swift, especially in the third act. This was her debut performance, and she has only acted sporadically since. Horror fans may know her from &quot;Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers&quot;, where she played Mary. Mark Hasan writes that the film &quot;remains a fine example of horror conveyed through emotion, circumstance and atmosphere instead of visual and aural pyrotechnics.&quot;\n\nUnfortunately, the best home release available right now (2015) is from Twilight Time. Their Blu-ray is limited to only 3000 copies, which has the side effect of driving the price way up. Good luck finding one new for under $40, which is out of the price range for most fans (especially when it can be seen for free on Netflix).",

I had the pleasure of driving Tony to the screening, and decided that I would stay for a few minutes to see the opening few minutes of the film, after seeing just a few seconds of it during the tech rehearsal earlier. After 30 seconds, I was hooked and could not get away. This film needs to be seen, people need to understand the conditions and circumstances presented in it of urban school environments; the trials that teachers and students face everyday, and the ravages wrought by &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot;. The role played by Sami Gayle is astonishing, where she found that character is beyond me. I gave it a 9 our of 10 only because there were some scene-break graphics in the film that, while making sense, seemed to me to break the flow of the film. A must see. Tough to watch in places, but necessary."

      "reviewBody": "In much of American culture, there is an invisible cultural pressure to be part of trends. These examples can be seen by the long lines whenever any new Apple product is released, by the people who run out to buy the latest designer clothing that is solely offered by Target, and by the what is means to be seen with Apple&apos;s white ear buds. Although there is a place and value for being part of the mainstream culture, each person carries with them a unique perspective into this world. And in the noise of all the marketing campaigns that try to target the greater population to adopt the next best product or service, it is becoming more difficult to be influenced by perspectives that are not mainstream but at the same time important in helping people see what it means to be human, in its challenges and struggles of life. Emad Burnat possesses a passion in capturing his Palestinian community in battling to retain their village land. His documentary 5 Broken Cameras brings about a view of his life that is rarely ever made conscious in the mainstream lives of the western world. One that gives us a glimpse of what it means to be part of the modern history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Although many people have heard about the long withstanding history of Israeli-Palistenian conflict over the West Bank, the documentary brings about a quality of humanity to the conflict through a first person perspective of using non-violence protest strategies to prevent Israeli developer&apos;s from building onto the land of their village of Bil&apos;in. Through six years worth of film, Emad is able to show a personable and affective-filled battle of many people in his village that risk their lives in protecting the land of their people. An important aspect that may often be lost to viewers of documentaries is that many of them are acting as a voice to those who have no voice. People of the western world are well-educated compared to the rest of the world and it is important that people learn to use their education and power to improve the lives of others. I have to admit that it is difficult in a world that constantly promotes the improvement of the individual and need to achieve individual success. There is an important significance that documentaries bring to the world. They pave a way for helping those with no voice gain attention and obtain a voice that is necessary. Emad has used his five broken cameras to give a voice to the village people of Bil&apos;in and is helping people understand that not everyone in this world has stability even in the basic needs of food and shelter. Being able to see even this one perspective, is likely to help people realize that there are more important issues at hand in the world other than obtaining the latest gadget or wearing the latest fashion trend. It is therefore critical that people understand the power they possess living in the western world and how they can use it to give a voice to those who need help and do not have a voice.",

When the entire country is at stake, how far is the US really willing to go with dealing with terrorists? We can claim our governments are moral and upholding human rights, but at the end of the day, the government can do whatever it wants. It doesn&apos;t need your approval, and it will do what it believes is required for self-preservation. This movie flaunts that idea.\n\nUnthinkable has excellent mind-play and dialogue that really gets you thinking and challenges what we really believe about human rights.",

The slow reveal of the characters&apos; backgrounds crept up on me and to my surprise left me absolutely gutted at the film&apos;s conclusion -and for some time after. I was left with a feeling of emotional and physical grief that i have not felt since my father died - the uncontrollable tide of internal pain. While a completely different genre, it reminded me of Sophie&apos;s Choice but in comparison made Streep&apos;s horror look like a walk in the park. Polley is amazing. What human&apos;s do to each other is tragic beyond description. And yet, we continue to torture our fellow humans and apparently fail to learn from our mistakes.",

      "reviewBody": "Only one review,by a true connoisseur of French cinema,Mr Guenot. He panned it;I deeply respect this reliable writer,but I tend to disagree.\n\nFirst of all,this is the third French movie in REAL TIME (no,the new wave did not invent the technique with &quot;Cleo De Cinq A Sept&quot; (1962)!) after Leonide Moguy&apos;s &quot;Le Deserteur &quot; aka &quot;Je T&apos;Attendrai &quot;(1939,thus before &quot;rope&quot; (1948) and the set up (1949));also in real time,Alex Joffé&apos;s &quot;Les Fanatiques&quot; (1957)\n\nWW2 is coming to an end ;on the seaside,resistant fighters are captured and imprisoned in a basement ;within an hour ,all of them will be shot .An hour of fear ,of impossible dreams ,of false hopes .Based on a Bernanos play ,it sometimes recall ,by the subject of sacrifice (a sacrifice of an average human being is not an average one),&quot;Dialogue Des Carmélites &quot;,in which nuns ,during the French Revolution,were guillotined ,because they would have betrayed their faith if they had accepted the new rules).\n\nRobert Hossein doesn&apos;t overplay:his part demands that he should show his fear of an impending death;he&apos;s the only one who understands German ,which might be a blessing and a curse .\n\nMarina Vlady (at the time,Hossein&apos;s real life wife) has the best line;when the prisoners are asked if there is a Jew among them, she simply answers &quot;If there were one,we all would be Jews too &quot; .\n\nThe final scenes were probably influenced by Stanley Kubrik&apos;s &quot;paths of glory&quot; and may seem a bit turgid,but they retain a certain greatness ; Jean Valère&apos;s first movie, though praised when it was released ,and a prize-winner at that,is ignored by the Dictionnaire Des Films today .His other movies such &quot;LA Femme Ecarlate &quot; or &quot; Mont-Dragon&quot; are worthless.\n\nNot a masterpiece but 77 min which deserve your undivided attention.\n\nlike this ? try these .....\n\n&quot;Jéricho&quot; (by the unfairly overlooked Henri Calef,1945) &quot;LE Repas Des Fauves &quot;(Christian-Jaque 1964)"

I am fully aware of the fact that &apos;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&apos; was an unusual Western when it came. After this there were other attempts or experiments made like this but I don&apos;t think that they succeeded. &apos;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&apos; has also the rare ability to even smell, taste or feel classic when you watch it ... Robert Redford was never better than here.\n\nRating: 9 of 10.",

Through a small window they see some beautiful young Swiss adolescents riding on horse back. These youngsters look like gods compared to the poor ants in the barn!\n\nIn another scene the hero of the film has been trying very hard for some time to assimilate, to become even more Swiss then the Swiss themselves. But he can&apos;t suppress his deep feelings of identity for ever. One day he enters a pub and watches a soccer match between Italy and Switzerland. At a certain moment he can&apos;t control himself any more and starts shouting to encourage the Italian team. He makes such a nuisance of himself that the Swiss throw him out.\n\nUtterly brilliant!",

      "reviewBody": "Even though Sadako had been around for a long time (there were Suzuki Koji&apos;s source books and two previous TV movies), it was the theatrical version of Ring that made her huge.  So, of course, there has to be a sequel (which, oddly enough, wasn&apos;t based on the next book in Koji&apos;s series; different filmmakers had already adapted that as Spiral).  It&apos;s a daunting task to make an effective sequel to one of the all-time creepiest movies, but the filmmakers pull it off.  Unfortunately, a lot of stupidity gets in the way of the scares.\n\nA lot of plot in this one.  The movie opens a week after the first one ends. Reiko&apos;s dad has just died, and she and her son have gone into hiding.  Mai, who found Ryuji&apos;s body at the end of Ring, is investigating her boss&apos;/boyfriend&apos;s death.  She thinks Reiko and her son hold the key to this mystery.  So she teams with one of Reiko&apos;s co-workers (who&apos;s still working on the story of the cursed videotape) to try and track Reiko down.  At this point, there&apos;s already enough plot for a movie, and I haven&apos;t even mentioned the return trip to Sadako&apos;s old home, the doctor who thinks he can get rid of Sadako, the burial of Sadako&apos;s physical body, the girl the co-worker betrays (and literally comes back to haunt him), and the weird, scary &quot;exorcism of Sadako&quot; finale.  Plot, plot, plot.\n\nBefore I tear this movie a new one, let me say one thing:  minute for minute, this one has more scares than the first one.  In fact, the filmmakers have realized that Sadako has become so commonplace (a Sadako doppleganger appears in almost every Japanese horror movie made after the first Ring) that they need only show her trademark hair to invoke fear.  And it works.  But the massive, ridiculous plot nearly kills this movie.  While it tries to explain the occurances of the first movie, it raises more questions than it answers (why does everyone suddenly have psychic ability?; why are people who haven&apos;t even seen the tape haunted by Sadako?; how does that girl see the tape if all the copies have been destroyed?)  Still, with all of these potholes, the movie still works.  It&apos;s also nice to see almost the entire cast of the first film reprise their roles (even the dead ones). An effective thriller, even though it doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense. Fans of the first one won&apos;t be disappointed.",

In the way Enter the Dragon changed films, in that almost all film fight scenes now have martial arts in them. Pumping Iron changed the attitude of many towards muscles and muscle men. It is true to say that before Schwarzenegger came along, men with muscles in film were often portrayed as stupid or slow. Arnold showed in this film that he had tons of personality, his charisma was as big as his chest and he made Bodybuilding seem cool. Look at films made since Pumping Iron, the lead actor often has to have muscle. Stallone, Van damn etc all owe a lot to Schwarzenegger for their success. Pumping Iron itself is an interesting exploration into the strange world of competitive bodybuilding and it successfully shows the variety of characters that exist within the &apos;sport&apos;. Since it was made bodybuilders are even bigger and certainly more muscular today than they were in Arnolds day. Truth is his build would not win today but at the time he was the best their was. There were more muscular men ( Franco is much more muscular )but he had the ability to show his body to the best advantage, hiding weaknesses and pushing his strong parts to the fore. Certain sides of bodybuilding are omitted ( drug taking, homosexuality ) but the film itself is very entertaining and crams a lot into a relatively short film.\n\nI recommend the DVD edition that others have mentioned as you get a lot more from it.",

      "reviewBody": "Rex Harrison is a temperamental conductor and Linda Darnell his younger, adoring wife in &quot;Unfaithfully Yours,&quot; also starring Lionel Stander, Rudy Vallee, and Kurt Krueger. Harrison and his wife are so much in love, it&apos;s sickening. But thanks to interference from his brother-in-law (a subdued Rudy Vallee), Harrison begins to believe that while he was out of town, his beautiful wife (Darnell) was consorting with his secretary, Tony, played by blond, handsome Kurt Krueger. As he conducts the orchestra in concert that evening, Harrison imagines several scenarios - one in which he kills his wife and cleverly frames Tony for the murder; one in which he pays her off; and one where he challenges Tony to a game of Russian roulette. Of course, when he actually tries to carry them out, things don&apos;t go as he imagined.\n\nThis is a hilarious movie, with Harrison absolutely magnificent - and I might add, totally unlikable. One wonders if Darnell will stay with him once the bloom is off the rose. Lanky and sure of himself, though not particularly handsome, Harrison has a certain magnetism, not to mention a snappy way with a line. &quot;Will I see you tonight at the concert?&quot; Vallee asks him. &quot;Yes!&quot; Harrison yells. &quot;I&apos;m generally there on the nights when I conduct!&quot; His last scene alone in the apartment is a scream, mainly because Harrison doesn&apos;t go for laughs but takes the whole thing very seriously and in character. Darnell is beautiful and appropriately cloying. Edgar Kennedy, as a classical music loving detective, has a wonderful scene with Harrison.\n\nI haven&apos;t seen the remake, but I noticed its voting average is lower than the original&apos;s. I can imagine Dudley Moore being quite funny, but this role, with its arch egotism, was tailor-made for Harrison.",

      "reviewBody": "The film is basically about this. A married couple is traveling around looking up sites connected to Christopher Columbus and various people give us some information about this historical figures life. There&apos;s also a woman who no one seems to see following them around, perhaps she is supposed to be an angel or something like that but it really didn&apos;t seem to fit in with the rest of the film.\n\nMonoel de Oliveira was 99 at the the time he directed it so just that he made it was a great achievement but to be honest it wasn&apos;t too good.\n\nIt was filmed quite beautifully! And many of the scenes were great by themselves. However it&apos;s structure was rather poor. It jumped too much in time and the beginning of the film didn&apos;t have too much to do with the rest as it focuses on the leads youth and travel to America which is just cut off. So much is built up to at this point. We have yet to meet the father who called on the lead and his brother and the flow was rather nice but then we are multiple years later and he is a doctor and a scientist lecturing a group of people on diagnoses. We are then told that he has a fiancé back in Portugal but has history as a &quot;mistress&quot;.\n\nWe then cut a few years into the future and our lead is getting married. And what follows (this is about half way into the film) is the actual plot which features 3 of their journeys, their honeymoon and two trips as old people. We have not heard a single word about Columbus since the beginning.\n\nWhat&apos;s sad is that it&apos;s all so underplayed. We never really get close to the couple and we never really see it&apos;s obsession nor what it does to their marriage. Yes he is always talking about Columbus but we never get to see what drives it and what consequences it has. Furthermore the plot could have been built up more. As it is now it almost appears as mainly great single scenes thrown together. In fact it seems like they only got time to shoot about half the story. I really wish they had added more, included Columbus more or less all the way, gotten closer on the couple, shown how the lead got so obsessed with Columbus to begin with and perhaps also added something about how he went from a poor immigrant to a respected doctor.\n\nIt&apos;s length is just 75 minutes and it doesn&apos;t really give you time to get bored, the imagery is very nice to look at and you might learn a few things about Columbus. But this is far from a great film and I would not recommend it.",

The two cultures&apos; contact was fascinating and involving. I saw this movie years ago, and then once or twice on broadcast television channels. I wish I could see it again!

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this a number of times now so it&apos;s difficult for me to remember having trouble getting into the stylised form of acting and by 1944 dated expressionistic cinematography that other viewers might have. First time of watching it was on UK TV over 20 years ago with Part 2 and a documentary called Part 3 containing the remaining extant scenes, and I loved it. I&apos;m dead against arty farty pretentious movies and am always aware that being obscure does not automatically make a film a classic, but this really is a classic of its kind. It was Eisenstein&apos;s best work (imho) a rallying call to all of the disparate inhabitants of Mother Russia to work and fight together, which was ordered by Stalin and who was pleased with the similarities  I bet he was on tenterhooks waiting for Ivan to go insane though.\n\nIvan is crowned Tsar of all the Russias and proceeds to drag the country into the 16th century, disposing of external enemies in the form of Tartars, starting a long war against Livonia and limiting the influence of the antagonistic aristocracy, the boyars. The acting is intensely melodramatic, with endless sinister sidelong glances taken from acute camera angles and Ivan&apos;s pointy beard shown to good advantage, which to people not paying much attention can probably be mirth-inducing. But this was pulse-quickening propaganda for the new Russian working class to comprehend, not Artheads decades later - Eisenstein did it so memorably that like Potemkin it&apos;s still spellbinding today. Otoh he borrowed extensively from Snow White too for some of most incredible shadowy images in here, and his whole technique hadn&apos;t moved on from silent film. The use of the b&amp;w nitrate film, costumes, sets and angular ugly faces are wondrous to behold and Prokofiev&apos;s stirring music glues it all together triumphantly.\n\nAll in all, a knockout film with faults but which still defies and will survive all criticism.",

This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film&apos;s principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders&apos; film,it may well be Kroko&apos;s involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment.It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, on the suggestion of friends who were very excited about Wong Kar Wai&apos;s short in particular. I had never seen anything by that director, but I was interested enough in the concept of the movie (three short films by three directors of different nationality) to go along.\n\nThe first short, Wong&apos;s &apos;The Hand&apos;, is excellent; it is touching and powerful. The acting is so good that the sub-titles are barely necessary; the emotion in their voices conveys meaning in itself. I enjoyed this enough to want to see more of the director&apos;s work.\n\nThe second is Steven Soderbergh&apos;s &apos;Equilibrium&apos;, and it&apos;s the sort of film that I sometimes think the West has forgotten how to make. It&apos;s a funny, fast-paced bit of banter between two excellent actors (Alan Arkin and Robert Downey Jr.), both of whose professional lives are thrown off balance by women. Also, despite its short running time,it manages to stick in a number of amusing plot twists.\n\nWhich brings us to the third short, Michaelangelo Antonini&apos;s &apos;The Dangerous Thread of Things&apos;. As my friend put it: &quot;Like so many directors, he got old and he got horny&quot;. This is a shocking combination of bad acting, pointless storytelling, and unnecessary nudity...and this is not just my opinion; by about halfway through, most of the audience was laughing with embarrassment and more than a few were leaving the theatre.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Eros is a film of contrasts: two excellent pieces of cinema and one piece of garbage. If you like the work of Wong or Soderbergh, I highly recommend this film. If you are an Antonini fan, stay away...it&apos;ll just upset you."

The acting by young Björn Starrin, Jonas Rimeika and Tuva Novotny is great. There might be a place for a discussion whether murder and using drugs really is a funny subject. Here it is so however, although everything is far from the Tarantino treatment.\n\nBut you have to be Swedish to appreciate this. Or maybe Scandinavian.",

The film looks at a fanatical group of AS Roma supporters and the tragic and violent events leading upto their away game at hated rivals Juventus. Italian hooligan gangs or Ultras are among the most organised and violent in europe and this film sheds light onto their passions and why they do what they do. We see that their lives revolve entirely around the Sunday match and have dedicated their lives to their teams cause. We see the dead end lives they live outside the group and we see what the passion of the game and the togetherness of the group gives them. OK some of the fight scenes do seem a little staged and the fashions are very much outdated but this still gives a insight into the fanaticism that follows European soccer.",

There is a great deal of unnecessary narration, probably owing to the fact that no one thought Hemingway&apos;s words could be improved upon. I wish this movie had been made ten years later, when the sparse style of the prose could have been matched by the sparseness of the period.\n\nAll that aside, it&apos;s a beautiful movie and Tracy is excellent. You wouldn&apos;t think that an old-hand white guy actor would be able to carry off being a old-hand white guy actor doing an old Cuban man without looking silly. But he does, without trying to do anything besides portraying an aging fisherman. This is the key to his performance - he looks so comfortable in the role that you absolutely believe him as that fisherman. One of his greatest roles.",

True that the film evoked anger at many sects, but none could stop the film as everything is history and hence cannot be denied. The film supports religious harmony and breaks a lot of myths (including the one that Gandhi said &apos;hey ram&apos; after being shot). Every Indian should see the film (where he is a Hindu or a Muslim doesn&apos;t matter at all). For that India would live in peace.",

      "reviewBody": "The Three Godfathers Story has been made seven, count them, seven times for the big and small screen including three silent versions. This one which was directed by William Wyler before he hit the big time is one no frills western, very much suggested by the work of gritty silent screen cowboy William S. Hart. In fact I&apos;m surprised Hart never did a film version of this story himself.\n\nIf the three outlaws were bound for hell as suggested by the title Hell&apos;s Heroes, they certainly redeem themselves here. The only other versions of this story I&apos;ve seen are the other two big screen sound films. Unlike those two, peripheral characters are reduced to ciphers and the story concentrates on the outlaws who after they robbed the bank in New Jerusalem, find a dying mother giving birth on the desert. As in the other versions the three promise to get the baby back to civilization and the nearest civilization is what they just left in New Jerusalem. \n\nThe three outlaws are Charles Bickford, Raymond Hatton, and Fred Kohler. All three have been screen villains so no heroic behavior is expected of them by the audience especially Kohler. Hatton was more known for rustic oldtimers though and he&apos;s the sentimental one who gets his friends to start thinking about doing the right thing by the infant.\n\nThere&apos;s an additional reason for them doing the right thing here that is not in either of the other versions which I won&apos;t reveal.\n\nCertainly William Wyler&apos;s direction marked him as a man who would go on to bigger things than grind them out westerns. This is one of those, but Wyler and the material rise above it.",

      "reviewBody": "Loved this movie and wonder why it was so under-marketed. I went to see it because I actually took the Trans-Siberian train this summer and so of course this movie intrigued me. (Luckily my trip was not so eventful!) While of course the movie was more personal for me since I could really relate to a lot of the scenes about life on the train and in the stations, this movie will appeal to anyone who likes a good mystery. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is really well-done. And it definitely captures the current political and social climate of Russia today. Having dealt with the border guards in Siberia (over a visa problem) I witnessed first hand the &apos;wild west&apos; mentality that currently exists in that country. It may be hard for Americans to believe that the events that occur in this movie are realistic. But they are. And Woody Harrelson is a revelation. Ben Kingsley is great as always. I was not familiar with Emily Mortimer prior to this film but I will be on the lookout for her next film. It&apos;s a shame not many people will see this movie. Hopefully they&apos;ll catch it on pay per view. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is highly recommended for those people who have an appreciation of an elusive quality called charm. Charm is in short supply in today&apos;s cinema be it French, American or other. Charm is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it. The daydreams of a young composer may seem like a frivolous topic, but an actor of the caliber of Gérard Philipe make it all seem so worthwhile. The essence of the story, for me anyway, is the collision between dream and reality - our hero is constantly reminded of how ordinary life is, how unsatisfying compared to his luscious fantasies. He is constantly brought crashing down to earth. But these scenes are precisely the funniest ones. I recall especially the scene in the classroom where the kids mock him to death - how humiliating, but still it&apos;s hilarious.\n\nGérard Philipe said that the director René Clair left nothing to chance. Every tiny detail, every nuance was carefully thought out in advance. The greatest problem for René Clair was that of rhythm. Apparently they were always trying to shorten certain scenes by a few seconds in order to heighten the comic effect. \n\nOne of the greatest of all directors and an actor of unquestioned skill, conscientiousness and charm collaborate on an effort that reminds us of what French culture used to be. It may seem dated or even corny to some, but I hope that for others it serves as an image of cultural values that will not be seen again.",

I can sort of understand where Herzog is heading here (the quote displayed at the start of the film sort of makes things obvious), but it doesn&apos;t really seem to warrant a film, as even at 18 minutes long this feels a little stretched out and rather pointless. It is visually arresting, though, and it is an intimate portrait of something most of us don&apos;t really understand or connect with (even if we are always in a sense on a personal pilgrimage). It also isn&apos;t boring at all, although the music is a bit grating at times. All in all worth watching for Herzog enthusiasts, but a rather flat and bland film overall, with some wonderful and beautiful shots.\n\n6/10"

      "reviewBody": "Really, what&apos;s not to like? I&apos;d watch Natalie Wood read the phone book, and this flick left me wondering why Tony Curtis wasn&apos;t a bigger star, and why Henry Fonda and Lauren Bacall were relegated to second-tier parts (though their roles were prominent).\n\nWood plays Helen Gurley Brown, author of the hit book of the film&apos;s name, and Curtis plays a magazine editor of a successful, seedy magazine that thrives on digging up dirt on people. Curtis sets his sights on scandalizing the virgin Brown. The laughs are many and frequent, with numerous subtle and not-so-subtle puns sprinkled liberally throughout. On the not-so-subtle side,the opening scene with magazine employees meeting with the CEO in the Board Room continually plays off the concept of the magazine seeking to feed off the lowest common denominator of human indecency. Another example occurred as cars raced along the highway, a sign noted that the highway&apos;s extension would be opening in December 1960. That was struck through and replaced with dates in 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964, all struck through and ultimately replaced with something like &quot;to be determined&quot;. I can connect with that jab even today.\n\nWatching the movie caused me to research the 1962 book. Interestingly, the movie was loosely inspired by the book. And I mean loosely. The book is somewhat of a how-to guide, whereas the movie is a fictional imagining of the life of a much-younger Helen Gurley Brown, who was 40 at the publication of the book but 23 in the movie. Likely the movie&apos;s title was largely intended to parlay off the book&apos;s popularity. Good marketing.\n\nIt was also interesting and melancholy to note that the longtime delightful bit-part actress who played Emma Brand/Watson on the Andy Griffith Show, Cheerio Meredith, and had a minor role here, died on release day, 12/25/64. Burt Mustin also had a bit part. I always find it interesting to see actors such as Meredith and Mustin, who I mostly know from varying TV roles.\n\nAs usual, I loved seeing the sets and 60s style. I&apos;m fascinated with the decade and enjoy seeing society&apos;s attitudes, fashions, and ideals in that era. This film brings that to life in spades.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an excellent early film by Wellman, filled with all sorts of lovely detail and efficient film-making. The opening tracking shot through the swinging doors of the whorehouse sets the key note for what will be a pretty stylish little film. The opening scenes in the house are musical and full of bustle, rich in their suggestion of off screen space.\n\nThe film is chock full of little musical touches that lend it rhythm and style, like the scene in which Chatteron finds out about her lover&apos;s death--Wellman finishes it with a sweet rendition, by nearby musicians, of &quot;My Gal Sal&quot;, a very effective and surprising bit of counterpoint. And look at the interesting way he has of presenting all the observers of Chatterton&apos;s trial, in a series of little pan shots from one to the the other, each shot tied to the rhythm of Donald Cook&apos;s speech. You get the sense that Wellman&apos;s creative energy was really flowing here.\n\nChatterton is always good but particularly so here. Orry-Kelly&apos;s gowns really suit her and cinematographer Sid Hickock films her and the gowns well. There are a few frames here worthy of MGM. In her final scene, Wellman strips her of all make-up, a pretty unusual approach for the time, but typical of Wellman, who took pride in deglamorizing his actresses when the film called for it. It was a pretty brave scene for Chatterton. She and Wellman were both difficult to work with but liked each other, oddly enough.\n\nLots of fun character bits. Donald Cook (resident Warner Brothers good guy) is better than usual. James Murray, from King Vidor&apos;s &quot;The Crowd&quot; has an early role as the father of Chatterton&apos;s child. I like Harry Holman as the john whose pocket gets picked and Wellman regular Nick Copeland as the drunk in the bar.\n\nThis is an underrated film. I made a point of seeing it because Wellman, himself, who could be hard on himself, liked it a lot. He was right--it&apos;s top notch."

Okay, the film could have been a bit shorter, but the actors in my opinion really make up for it.

      "reviewBody": "Jess Franco, I love his films (The Sadistic Baron von Klaus; Venus in Furs), and I hate his films (Lust for Frankenstein; Female Vampire). Sometimes I love and hate them at the same time (Oasis of the Zombies). One of his best films is The Awful Dr. Orloff, a film that I re-watched just a couple days before viewing Vengeance of Dr. Mabuse. The latter film suffers badly in comparison.\n\nVengeance of Dr. Mabuse borrows a great deal from the first Orloff film. Mabuse (Jack Taylor) has both a female assistant and a hulking Frankenstein monster henchmen in the Morpho vein. Said monster ends up turning against its master because of love (or lust) for a woman. The climactic showdown between cop and monster in both Mabuse and the first Orloff film are strikingly similar. If that was not enough, both films rely on bums out fishing to provide the police with a clue to the villains&apos; hideout. Oh, and of course, both films deal with the abduction of a stripper. Although, strangely, in the print that I saw, Mabuse had less nudity than The Awful Dr. Orloff.\n\nI know that some Franco fans like the way his films intersect, but, to me, The Vengeance of Dr. Mabuse shows a lazy director dropping in plot points from a movie he made better a decade before.\n\nFinally, in all of the other Dr. Mabuse films, the man is a master criminal. He does not work for others! Yet, this Mabuse alludes to the trouble he and his cohorts will be in from &quot;the organization&quot; if they abandon the project. Mabuse as a mafia stooge. . . what a let down!",

The visual settings are magnificent, and Gina Lollobrigida was never more seductive or beautiful than in this motion picture. Connery shows more depth than in many of his later films--one wonders what direction his career might have taken if he had not fallen into the clutches of &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli and the whole 007 thing. Sir Ralph is, well, Sir Ralph--imperious, petulant, old school upper class damn-the-servants Brit...This film plays strongly to anyone interested in the psychological stress a crime induces in the various participants, and this is one of the many factors that separate it from the run of the mill police procedural. Finally, it has an evocative and excellent musical score--and no wonder, since Rimsky-Korsakov&apos;s Cappricio Espanol features prominently as a mood-setter. Altogether, a good rainy afternoon movie!",

      "reviewBody": "You have to give credit to producer-director Al Adamson    he has a rare talent for getting well-known actors to star in his atrocious movies. This film (and several other Adamson projects) was put together slowly over a period of years.  What Adamson ended up with was a film that features J. Carrol Naish (in his last role) as Dr. Frankenstein, living under an alias while he manages an amusement park (!),  Lon Chaney, Jr. (in his last role) is Frankenstein&apos;s moron assistant who obediently fetches the heads of young girls.  Russ Tamblyn (&quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;tom thumb&quot;) plays an aging biker. Even Jim Davis (Jock Ewing from &quot;Dallas&quot;) has a part in this disaster. And Forest J. Ackerman (editor of Famous Monsters of Filmland) is one of the monster&apos;s victims, along with Anthony Eisley (&quot;The Navy versus the Night Monster&quot;).\n\nAdamson also manages to insult several famous props from classic films; some of the lab equipment he used is from &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot;. Adamson&apos;s busty blond wife (Regina Carrol) is bitten by Dracula (played by an actor named Zandor Vorkov, who looks like Frank Zappa in &quot;Kiss&quot; makeup). Frankenstein also has a dwarf assistant, played by Angelo Rossitto, who starred in the bizarre 1932 film &quot;Freaks&quot;.  All in all, a remarkable film from the man who gave the world &quot;Blood of Ghastly Horror&quot;."

I was 19, and at university as a fresher when the Berlin Wall fell - an event that, looking back, none of us ever thought would happen. The euphoria is captured as I remembered at the time. Then the football World Cup in 1990, Gunnar&apos;s marriage breakdown, Hartmut&apos;s clumsy attempts to usurp his father, through to the deaths of Anton and Ernst, the cancer suffered by Clarissa - all of these events can be related somehow to all our own experiences of the 1990s. That is why Heimat 3 ranks so highly - the director managed to get me to feel nostalgic for events that occurred so recently. In the years to come, these feelings will grow stronger and Heimat 3 will become even more poignant for me.",

From Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees, and Freddy Krueger to Pinhead, Chucky, and Leatherface, this serves as a supplement to any horror/slasher fan&apos;s video collection. Unfortunately, some of the scenes they chose were not the best (there were far bloodier and scarier scenes in the Friday the 13th series than the one they chose from JASON GOES TO HELL) and they left out a few of the classic slashers (Santa Claus killer from SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT, Jack Frost, the Thomas Sinclair/Bryan Lawson brother/killer duo from the GLENVILLE films, the URBAN LEGEND killers, etc). But the `film&apos; is more than adequate and provided me with a list of horror movies on my `must-see&apos; list. Commentary on the DVD edition is done by none other than Robert Englund. RATING: 6 out of 10.",

But everything about this film clicks both in terms of storytelling and cast. You know you&apos;re onto a winner when you have an actor of John Mahoney&apos;s quality in a very small role.\n\nThe fact is that this could happen in real life and the results would probably be much the same as they are on screen. I know some people take the approach of &quot;I see real life everyday, I go to the cinema to escape it&quot; but this film is very much a celebration of family life and love and those things are just as important as big budget blockbusters with CGI galore.",

      "reviewBody": "Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a highly trained, U.S. spy whose wounded body is found floating in an ocean by a fishing boat. With no memory of who he is and what happened to him, he has to piece together how he came to be shot in the back and left for dead; and most importantly, who and what he is. But Damon must do it fast, as time is running out and the ones he worked for are sending assassins to find him. &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is top-notch spy movie, filled with action, suspense, and a mystery that is slowly explained as the movie goes on. Matt Damon is well suited for the role, and with the help of fancy editing, he comes off as a martial arts expert who can quickly dispatch multiple foes in a few seconds. The movie moves along very fast, making the near two hour running time feel like it&apos;s thirty minutes shorter than it is. Fast pacing and a likable hero (Damon) are two big strengths of this movie that fans of spy/thriller/suspense movies should not miss. My most memorable, movie moment of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is the scene when Damon evades the police with an original Mini car! Hey, it&apos;s not the car, it&apos;s the driver that counts.\n\nMannysmemorablemoviemoment",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a biography of Korean karate master Oyama, whose students include the actor that drew me to watch this film, Sonny Chiba. I wasn&apos;t sure how I felt about a film about someone who, ignore the one heroic bull fight shown here, he did make a career out of &quot;fighting&quot; and killing tamed and tethered bulls with his bare hands; given my feeling on blood sports generally, this seemed to be a rung down the ladder from even those. That said I thought I&apos;d watch the film to see what Chiba could do. The first thing that hits you is that the film has dated and unfortunately it is well enough made that it has not dated in a cheesy enjoyable way.\n\nThe story told here is interesting enough in its very brisk flit through the early life of Oyama. We see his frustration with the world of karate, his killing in self-defence of a man and his subsequent attempts to make it right in regards the man&apos;s widow and young son. There isn&apos;t a lot of drama in the telling though and not a great deal of characterisation to gets one teeth into – interesting in the overview to a point but not a gripping story. This leaves the martial arts action to carry the burden and this it does, to a point. The fights are reasonably enjoyable but they are pretty &quot;straight&quot; in their delivery with very little in the way of impressive choreography or design to them. They aren&apos;t helped much by the very shaky camera which doesn&apos;t look like a deliberate choice since it tends to detract rather than add (those that think the Bourne movies etc just have &quot;shaky cameras&quot; should watch this to see the difference between it working as a device and not working as a device). The actions and tough standoffs are quite good though, but having Chiba in there makes them a bit better.\n\nAs a physical presence I didn&apos;t see here why he has a big name, since to my amateur eye he is not as good as others I have seen make it into film, but he does have a decent presence as a leading man in this film. Yamaguchi maybe doesn&apos;t make this a thrilling martial arts film that I was hoping for, but there are some very good locations that are used well, a rain storm, the long grass of fields etc that I thought looked better than they played out.\n\nMaybe I&apos;ll try the rest of this short series of films from Chiba, but on the basis of this one I&apos;m not so sure. It lacked a strong plot and characters to draw me in and the action was solid but not spectacular or thrilling. Still a solid martial arts film, but not a great deal more than that."

      "reviewBody": "Over the years George A. Romero has created a number of landmark horror films for the genre. This modern &apos;vampire&apos; flick ranks among his very best films!\n\nShy teenager, who believes himself to be a century old vampire, comes to live with his superstitious old cousin in Pittsburgh.\n\nRomero&apos;s Martin is a truly unique, one of a kind psychological thriller. It is a memorable journey from its disturbing opening sequence to its chilling conclusion. Martin, like most of Romero&apos;s classics, is a film with plenty of social commentary and believable characters. The driving force behind the films premise is the question of whether or not our title character really is a vampire. Martin has no fangs, no fear of the sun, in fact he actually uses razors and syringes to seize his victims. Yet, Martin has memories of an attack that apparently he did ages ago and his elderly cousin fully believes his young relative to be an evil creature. Romero throws out all of the old fashion vampire conventions for this symbolic clashing of the ways. Romero&apos;s direction is, as always, very nicely done with plenty of suspense, atmosphere, and gruesome moments. Romero makes this drama stylishly operatic and adds an occasional moment of dark humor. The haunting music score also adds greatly to the atmosphere.\n\nThe cast is excellent, but it&apos;s star John Amplas who really drives this show. Attractive youth Amplas is a greatly sympathetic character, even as he is the films monster and hero all at once.\n\nA film unlike any other of the horror genre, Martin remains a terrific low-budget masterpiece that is as hauntingly effective today as ever.\n\n**** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "Now turning 40, Mitch Roberts is at ease with himself and full of confidence.  He is doing well at work his marriage is good and he is happy. His friend Phil is causing him some trouble as he has Mitch&apos;s old job but isn&apos;t working well and further stress arrives for Mitch in the shape of his deadbeat brother Glen.  However the trio get excited when Mitch discovers a map to hidden gold in the lining of Curly&apos;s hat.  But can the group recover the gold successfully?  Is it even real? And is Mitch just imagining that Curly has come back from the grave to haunt him?\n\nI saw this years ago in the cinema and had vague memories of it as being pretty good.  I saw it a few nights ago on TV and have to say that my memory has not served me well.  The plot here is silly  any excuse to get three wise-crackers out on horses again in the wild west.  The way they manage to rope Jack Palance back in doesn&apos;t really work and hurts the feel of the film.  In the original Palance worked but here it feels like he&apos;s been shoehorned into it and that he&apos;s forced to over egg the cake.\n\nThe film has a few good lines and laughs but too often it just repeats jokes from the first film to lesser effect.  It&apos;s a shame because the film is freed from the sentimental soul searching that bogged down the latter stages of the original.  However it does nothing with this freedom.  I&apos;m sure I remembered this as a comic adventure yarn, again I was mistaken.  The same old jokes but it lacks a soul or a centre.  The original may have been a little sentimental but it complimented the comedy for the most part  here that is missing, and it hurts.\n\nCrystal delivers his lines with vigour and is funny  I always find him funny!  But at times he does look like he&apos;s on autopilot.  Stern is also just treading the same old material over and is only so-so.  Kirby decides not to return so Lovitz replaces him and actually does alright.  However his brand of humour isn&apos;t as good as Crystal and the two don&apos;t gel  although he does get some good laughs.  Palance tries again but the Oscar magic isn&apos;t there and I couldn&apos;t help feel he took away from his original role somewhat.\n\nOverall this is amusing at best but really pales against the original (which wasn&apos;t a classic itself).  The action isn&apos;t up to much and the comedy only delivers a few laughs, preferring instead to retread as many of the original&apos;s jokes as possible."

Thousands stood and acknowledged others for helping out. This extraordinary film shows the real meaning of citizenship and civility. It is a positive reminder of what we are really made of. This film should be seen by anyone who cares about anyone.\n\nThis movie shows how people of all backgrounds, religions, geographic locations, came together with one purpose: to help. It is an acknowledgement of those who generously gave of themselves because the needs of others were more important. Stand up for these people and see this movie.",

I didn&apos;t really expect anything great, as Austrian movies (except comedies) usually lack any entertainment factor and are consumable for a small, intellectual audience only. Ainoa is quite the opposite. Although based on a deeply poetic and philosophic thought, the film convinced me with its narrative quality, the surprisingly well performing actors and the enormous love for detail that these guys show in every scene of the movie. Hard to imagine this film has been shot entirely in Austria, the locations throw you into another world. And hard to imagine they hardly had any money for that. Of course Ainoa cannot be compared with big Hollywood blockbuster movies, but i think these filmmakers id a good job in making that NOT the point at all. That&apos;s what i really enjoyed about it. Its not just a poor &quot;Austrian Star Wars&quot;, much more than that this movie has a soul and a quality of its own, although the story might irritate some people with its very simple, sometimes even naive but always thoughtful approach. Instead of relying on big special effects, it convinces with its heart and poetry. Its worth while watching it for those who like Sci Fi and fairy tales, or simply a movie not seen every day in cinema.",
