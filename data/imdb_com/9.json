      "reviewBody": "This is the only film I ever paid to see two days in a row. I missed too much of it the first time because of my own hysterical snorting laughter.\n\nThis is a work of comic genius. And, like any good film, the screenplay is at the heart of the belly laughs. Every character is given a detailed personality quirk or two, and then it is shamefully exploited for laugh after laugh. Note for example, John Cleese&apos;s speech to Jamie Lee Curtis about how awful it is to be British - the eternal fear of embarrassment. Moments later, he is caught buck naked in a marital tryst in some else&apos;s flat by the people to used to live in his own home. Also, the funny-offensive envelope is pushed to the limit when K-K-K-Ken (Michael Palin), the passionate animal lover inadvertently kills three innocent dogs in his attempt to murder an old woman who would otherwise be a prosecution witness. Now that&apos;s funny!\n\nCleese&apos;s character, Archie Leach (Carey Grant&apos;s real name) is a likable buffoon  of a lawyer, happy in his banal existence until he meets the sexy American, Wanda (Jamie Lee). I cannot even being to describe the plot beyond that point without doing it a grave disservice. It twists and dangles about in a world of double-cross and goldfish-eating for no other reason than to set up a joke.\n\nYou cannot speak of this film without mention of Kevin Kline as Otto, a role that won him a richly-deserved Oscar. Otto is the ex-CIA &quot;weapons man&quot; who makes it his business to read philosophy but would be more at home with Curious George. An obsessive, self-indulgent, painfully stupid, violent, deceitful, gullible  egomaniac, the character of Otto is amongst the best comedic performances ever delivered.\n\nThe film&apos;s funniest scene takes place at Leach&apos;s (Cleese) house. In a scene that rivals anything that has ever hit the screen for laughs, the film and its scripts looks deep enough into itself to even give Cleese&apos;s dry-as-toast wife a laugh or two. Then, later on, this scene proves to be the set up for even more jokes. A Fish Called Wanda is pure comedy and every scene either provides a laugh or sets one up - it graciously does not waste our time trying to be moral or turning into a formula car-chase flick.\n\nMy comments are choppy but so is this movie. If you see it and don&apos;t laugh, check your pulse. We have only been given a handful of good comedies in the last decade. A Fish Called Wanda is a treasure. **** out of ****.\n\nNOTE: TBS and some other TV networks show this film with the &quot;offensive language&quot; edited out. It kills the movie - if you can&apos;t hack the language, pass this one over.",

Many seem to have preferred the raw look that &apos;El Mariachi&apos; had and while &apos;Desperado&apos; is more &apos;sophisticated&apos; in the making and more polished, that doesn&apos;t prevent it from being an awesome action entertainer. For me, it was just as much fun as &apos;El Mariachi&apos;. Rodriguez does what he does best. He already mentioned that his Mariachi films are a tribute to the western cinema that names like Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood defined and &apos;Desperado&apos; works perfectly with its comic book story, quirky characters and over-the-top action sequences. Moving at a rapid pace, the direction and editing are top notch. The cinematography is brilliant too. Antonio Banderas does a good job taking over the role from Carlos Gallardo (who sort of plays his sidekick in this one). However, it is Salma Hayek that steals the show even though the story is dominated by El Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, &apos;Desperado&apos; is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be."

Mute and half paralyzed, his friends -- who incidentally are the best the film world has -- arranged for him to &apos;direct&apos; a last significant film. The idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it. So we have a film: about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. And the matter of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love.\n\nThe film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination. The result is pure movie-world: every person (except the director) is lovely in aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. There is no nuance, no hint that anything exists but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create.\n\nI know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually like he does. Morrison&apos;s Celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion: the sensual touch that implies but doesn&apos;t physically touch.\n\nAntonioni&apos;s redhead wife appears, appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster &apos;making of&apos; film that is on the DVD.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

Andre convinces the jury to acquit. After the trial, he gives her a job at his shop. He keeps her identity a secret from his family but his son Pierre (Glenn Ford) recognizes her. His daughter Francois is overjoyed to be engaged to Robert LaCoste who owns the dance studio next door. Robert turns out to be a lascivious sleaze with his eye on Natalie.\n\nIt&apos;s a lesser old movie. The acting is broad and so are the attempts at humor. This is a remake of a French film and I&apos;m sure a ton of jokes don&apos;t get through the translation. The trial takes place in the first thirty minutes. Andre is a childish considering the situation. It seems to be aimed as a comedy but it&apos;s not funny. After Natalie gets the job, there are some sitcom-like misunderstandings. Again it&apos;s not funny but it&apos;s still watchable. The movie feels short-changed and the shorter running time may have something to do with that.",

This was Ray&apos;s first movie, but his economy of dialog, his synchronization and sympathy with India&apos;s rural life is incredible. So little said, yet so much! Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a &quot;kash&quot; field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter? No. His expression and technique was more than sound, although this was a maiden venture. \n\nSome critics found(and still find, I might add) the film to be too slow. Satyajit Ray wrote about the slow pace - &quot;The cinematic material dictated a style to me, a very slow rhythm determined by nature, the landscape, the country. The script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble.&quot;\n\nThere you are, if you have not watched this movie, you&apos;ll probably missed the greatest movie made on Indian rural life. That&apos;s why Akira Kurosawa said of him:&quot;To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun&quot;",

Now Alice, already in a fragile mental state, must deal with that as well as an ex who recently got out of prison.\n\nI found myself enjoying this film much more than I thought that I would&apos;ve, thanks in no small part to a nice atmospheric soundtrack as well as a surprisingly adequate subdued performance by Murphy. All of this is almost (but not quite) enough to make up for a pretty clichéd and heavily predictable storyline. The late Britt does the most with what little she&apos;s given.\n\nMy Grade: C",

      "reviewBody": "This an important, interesting movie depicting the Overlord operation with monumental logistic and means of effecting the Normandy landing , the most difficult campaign of war . The picture brings to life the famous images of WWII and splendidly the most sensational military operation of the history in an Allied hard-fought effort . The film develops the previous days to the D-Day invasion , such as the landings and the advance over France . The film is magnificently produced in big budget by the great 20th Century Fox producer Darryl F. Zanuck . Evocative cinematography by Jean Bourgoun and catching song by Paul Anka with musical score by Maurice Jarre . Excellent casting by a great plethora of stars . Special mention for John Wayne as Lt. Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort , he&apos;s top-notch as a tough , valiant officer in this believable war film and terrific acting by Richard Todd as Major commanding Us paratroopers dropped to protect the flanks of the invasion and taking strategic bridge . Furthermore , known Generals and officers played by prestigious players , as Germans : General Gunther (Curt Jurgens) , Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Hinz) , Field Marshal Von Rundstedt (Paul Hartmann), and Allied : Brig. General Theodore Roosevelt Jr (Henry Fonda) , Brig. General Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum) , General Haines (Mel Ferrer) , Brig. General James Gavin (Robert Ryan) , General Raymond Barton (Edmond O&apos;Brien), Lt General OMar N Bradley (Stuart) , General Bernard L Montgomery (T. Reid) and General Dwight D. Eisenhower played by Henry Grace . Grace was a famed set designer , while he worked extensively for many films , his only appearance was an uncredited performance as Eisenhower ; despite not being an actor , he was cast for his uncanny resemblance to the General . This famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous , risky landing maneuvers was professionally directed by a magnificent trio of directors , Ken Annakin , Bernhard Wicki and Andrew Marton.\n\nAdding more details along with the well developed on the movie , the events that happened on June 6, 1944 were the following ones : Shortly after midnight on June 6, about 23.500 US and British paratroopers landed along the edges of the landing beaches . Their mission was to seize vital bridges and communications centers. They also had to hold off any Germans counterattacks until they were relieved by the amphibious forces. The Airbone landings were largely successful. Some US troops missed their target and end up scattered over the countryside. The main amphibious landings took place after an artillery bombardment from some 200 Allied warships at German positions also came under attack from Allied medium and heavy bombers. They were part of the 11,500 aircraft committed to D-Day. They bombed the Germans on and behind the five landing beaches. US troops landed on Utah beach. Strong currents and inaccurate navigation meant that they were a little away from their precise target. They landed about 1 mile (1,6 km) south. The beach there was relatively undefended. The troops soon knocked out the only concrete gun position guarding the beach.Demolitions teams cleared paths through the obstacles the beach and the first tanks crossed the Atlantic Wall. They fanned out into the countryside to link up with the paratroopers. By nightfall of D-Day some 23,000 men and 1,700 vehicles had gone ashore. The beach had been highly congested for much of the day. Utah was a triumph ,however Omaha beach was nearly a disaster, the fight was the most difficult. The Us troops were unable to get off the beach to make room for later waves of invaders. There were better defenses there than on the other beaches, and the German defenders were positioned on high ground, from where they could pour fire down on the attackers.The allies also made mistakes. The naval bombardment ended too soon, and the bombers missed their targets and launched landing crafts and amphibious tanks too far out from the beach, may were sunk. When the first assault wave landed ,it faced a bar-rage of fire , some men were thinking of evacuation. However small groups began to make it off the beach to the high ground beyond. By dusk, some men were ashore, most were still crowed on the beach. The high ground beyond was only thinly held by exhausted survivors waves. Some 2300 US troops had been killed in the landings. The operation had come close to disaster. The three Anglo-Canadian beaches-Gold, Sword and Juno stretched fore some 25 miles. They were wide and open and ideal for amphibious landings. The British on Gold and Sword quickly crashed though the Atlantic wall. Their success was due partly to a range of specially developed armored vehicles known as Funnies. The Canadians at Juno had a tougher time. They faced rough seas and alert defenders .By late morning ,they were also pushing inland. Despite the horror of beaches , overall Allied losses were far lower than expected. Some 6000 US personnel were killed, wounded, or missing, along with 4300 British and Canadian troops. German losses totaled between 4000 and 8000. By the day&apos;s end ,some 128000 Allied soldiers were ashore and many more were on their way.",

They may not know Rowan&apos;s real name, but they know the character.\n\nThe sad part about this film is that it&apos;s absolutely wonderful, and most people in America aren&apos;t going to see it because it&apos;s rated &quot;PG&quot;. Not a dirty gag, foul word, or joke about someone&apos;s junk to be found. And the really amazing part is that it&apos;s half comedy, half gorgeous scenery surrounding it. It mocks the Hollywood standard, it has melodious music, it&apos;s masterfully filmed, and all the while you just find yourself going &quot;Oh, that Bean.&quot; *puts fists on hips*\n\nI can&apos;t honestly say I&apos;ve seen a film this good, this funny, this... pure that can make anyone laugh and find themselves feeling charmed after having seen it. Emma De Caunes stole my heart, Max Baldry is a kid that anyone his age can relate to, and Defoe actually pulls out a great, over-the-top performance without even uttering a four-letter word that he&apos;s so very good at snarling out.\n\nYou know what? Shame on us America. That we need the big bang, the flatulence, and the double entendre to amuse our soured idea of comedy. What is so wrong with having a character like Bean, a performance like Atkinson&apos;s, that we can&apos;t find that part of us that wasn&apos;t soured on tasteless &quot;humor&quot; but just absorb and let out a barrel-chested sigh of satisfaction after a hearty laugh from a genuine, clever clean joke or visual gag?\n\nWe&apos;ll go on, with our Jackasses and Scary Movie XII and we&apos;ll forget about them five minutes after we&apos;ve left the theater, but darnit, it&apos;s high time a movie like Mr. Bean&apos;s Holiday came along. And I for one would pay money to see this again, even if the American know-it-alls of Hollywood think it&apos;s better suited in a death slot in September, to be forgotten, sandwiched between sequel after sequel and the banality of teen slasher flicks acted by twenty-somethings whose genre should have died off years ago.\n\nIf what Atkinson says is true, that this is the last time Bean will ever appear, then he&apos;s gone out on the highest note you could ever bestow on a character so beloved. Shine on Bean, and ride off into that sunset, you crazy, wonderful fella you. And thanks for all the laughs.\n\n... But where&apos;s Teddy?",

      "reviewBody": "The Lady Vanishes is a wonderful piece of fluff, the culmination of Hitchcock&apos;s British period, after which he started to explore more serious themes in his American films. Of course the basic plot is absurd, centering around the most ridiculous way to get a secret message through one can think of, and why did.....o well, never mind, it&apos;s the handling that matters, and Hitchcock achieves a near perfect balance here of humour and suspense that he only really matched on one other film, North By Northwest.\n\nThe film spends 20 or so minutes just introducing it&apos;s characters, but they are all so great, especially the two men so obsessed with returning to a cricket match that a case of disappearance and possibly murder is relatively unimportant, that it hardly matters, while Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood simply sparkle as the main couple who of course initially can&apos;t stand each other. Once on the train, the ensuring mystery and sleuthing are riveting,and full of fantastic little details- the name on the window, the nun with high heeled shoes, the fight amidst a magician&apos;s paraphenalia The final shootout is excellently staged and still quite exciting. The laughs are constant, with some helarious lines, but they never detract from the suspense. Of course there&apos;s those shoddy model shots, but hell, this is a film from 1939!\n\nHitchcock had countless classics to come, including such complex masterpieces as Vertigo and Rear Window, but the delightful, hugely enjoyable The Lady Vanishes is a little masterpiece of it&apos;s own."

      "name": "The Israeli/Palestinian Conflict Rendered Even More Hopeless",
      "reviewBody": "This film makes a big assumption that its audience has at least a practical knowledge of the history of the Israel/Palestinian conflict. There&apos;s almost no context offered other than a brief recap of the 6 Days War in 1967 when Israeli forces under the leadership of the charismatic Moshe Dayan invaded and conquered Palestinian controlled lands on two fronts, including Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian lands. To the south on the border with Egypt is the Gaza Strip and to the east is the West Bank encompassing the lands extending to the Jordan River and includes the ancient city of Jerusalem. These ostensibly autonomous regions were officially under Palestinian rule but nearly every aspect of daily life was controlled, monitored and regulated by Israeli agencies and forces. Never mentioned are the contentious circumstances of Israel&apos;s establishment as an actual nation following World War II, and thus a key aspect of the conflict is conspicuously absent, presumably because it would require at least 2 or 3 hours just to review this subject, even superficially. Needless to say, it&apos;s a complex and convoluted history, and prior biases and prejudices are inevitable, and the film is certainly not innocent of this transgression, but this in no way diminishes the impact and resonance of the film&apos;s superbly executed theatrics. \n\nYes, the film relies extensively on the old documentary trope of the well lit talking head, but The Gatekeepers triumphs in its masterful incorporation of actual Israeli military footage of aerial and ground attacks, and even more so by the photographs which through remarkable computer enhancement are rendered sculptural. The way these black &amp; white still photos are made to spring to 3 dimensional life is a sublimely potent metaphor for the ability of artful storytelling to reanimate presumably long dead history. The words of the various former leaders of the Shin Bet carry an undeniable gravitas and echo in the mind and soul as we are visually guided on a tour of their previously little known realm. By focusing on the subtle variations and contradictions of each speaker&apos;s version of events and policies and tactics we are made acutely aware of the generations old conflict&apos;s profound effect upon the psyches of everyone involved. The most confident and stoic of the former leaders is possessed of a deep sense of tragedy. Avraham Shalom - who headed Shin Bet from 1981 to 1986 during the time of an incident where two Palestinian prisoners were ordered killed while being held in captivity - casually denies his culpability but it&apos;s apparent that the incident has inflicted deep wounds which even today are still very tender. \n\nThe mind bending paradoxes of the seemingly intractable conflict have left their mark on all these competent, eloquent and even brave men, and some are willing to admit that perhaps they have behaved immorally and even criminally while also acknowledging the irony of their cruel treatment of Palestinians as inexcusable behavior for a people as historically mistreated as the Jews. It&apos;s a desperately poignant moment when the individual men all express their doubts and even contempt for the political leaders who so brazenly exploit the horrific conflict for their own ends. These six men who were charged with the gruesome task of eliminating threats to Israel&apos;s security are oddly some of the most compelling critics of their nation&apos;s treatment of the Palestinians.",

I don&apos;t know about you, but when I watch a werewolf movie I hope to actually SEE the werewolf from time to time.  You DON&apos;T SEE THE WEREWOLF in this movie.  There are parts of it shown for a couple seconds here and there, but you never see the whole thing.  This movie tries to be a mystery, wanting you to figure out who the wolf is.  It isn&apos;t too hard to figure out, and the answer is confusing.  If you want to watch a good werewolf movie, try the first Howling (stay away from parts 3 and 7 AT ALL COSTS) or Silver Bullet."

The concept of this movie is weak, the bad guys are boring, very unfunny - the good guys totally lack any charisma, and their pranks and jokes are very week to make this movie valuable. The movie is just a sandwich without anything saucy in it. Scenes are busy, unoriginal, plot is hysterically stupid. This movie is anything but even remotely funny comedy. The natural chemistry in &quot;the good guy-good girl&quot; is misisng here, too it doesn&apos;t come out of the concept, the main character in my opinion failed in fitting into positive role, somebody viewer could be interested in or laugh at. I normally like easy and dull comedies - for example scary movie series - but this failed even for me. This was below any college movie where bunch of nerdy guys want to get laid. I am greatly disappointed in this title. My recommendation would be to avoid this one.",

      "reviewBody": "A group of G.I. soldiers in the jungles of the Vietnam War meet a native young girl. They are raping and torturing it brutally and finally kill it. One soldier is disgusted by this inhuman behavior and reports this crime to his officers, who try to turn him down. Finally his former mates are sentenced to military jail or have to leave the army.\n\nThis whole story really happened in Vietnam in 1967. It was the turn of German independent film maker Michael Verhoeven make a film about it in 1970, in real underground style, with b/w steady cams and German actors down in the forests of Bavaria. There is no jungle but just European forests. The actors are speaking with Bavarian German accents and wear groovy seventies&apos; style haircuts. It wasn&apos;t Verhoeven&apos;s idea to make a &quot;real&quot; Vietnam war movie but rather a reflection of the war brutality on the human soul.\n\nThe brutal rape sequences are shown in full and long details which appears rather like a mondo cane documentary or snuff movie. There is no space left here for any kind of humanity in this scene - all of the soldiers are turning to animals are torturing the girl in most disgusting ways. Only G.I. Eriksson, played by director Verhoeven himself, tries to withdraw from the scene but is forced by his mates to rape the girl as well. Another soldier who becomes eye witness to the scene is shot.\n\nThe real touch of this movie is sometimes really unbearable, and although it was filmed in Bavaria with a low budget it has more impact on the spectator than many Hollywood Vietnam movies like Joel Schumacher&apos;s visually similar &quot;Tigerland&quot;. The pain, cruelty and inhumanity of the soldiers can be felt in every second of this movie with its harmless title, and at its peak, &quot;OK&quot; reaches such a high level of emotions than another great German anti-war-movie, Bernhard Wicki&apos;s &quot;Die Bruecke&quot; (The Bridge, 1959).\n\nThere can be seen some popular German actors in this film such as Rolf Zacher and Friedrich von Thurn as soldiers, Eva Mattes as the girl and Gustl Bayrhammer (&quot;Pumuckel&quot;) as an army officer. At the beginning of the film, the actors are all introducing themselves with their real names, ages and marital status. In the end, Verhoeven probably seemed to calm down the high emotional story by showing the whole cast and crew behind the scenes and finally the main actors going out to a pub after filming. There is also a very strange moog synthesizer score, repeating an electronic loop every few minutes again.\n\nThe story of his first performances was nearly as thrilling as the plot itself. During his debut at the Berlin Film Festival in 1970, the movie became a big scandal, and many critics left the first screening in disgust - the whole festival was closed down just after this first screening. There&apos;s been a big media hype with lots of negative reviews, and later on, &quot;OK&quot; was shown again at a San Francisco film festival where it became a big hit and a minor cult movie for the anti-war movement.\n\nToday, this early Michael Verhoeven direction is a rather forgotten German movie diamond, but its power and impact can still be felt after more than 30 years. In Germany it was shown on TV for the first time in 2001. In 1990, it was Brian de Palma&apos;s turn to do a remake with Michael J. Fox, entitled &quot;Casualities of War&quot;, based on the same real incident in a lonely Vietnam jungle in the late sixties.",

You can say the same for most Pre-Code films; they&apos;re just different, and usually in an interesting way.\n\nIt was the short running time, the great acting of Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young&apos;s character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy-but-intriguing film.\n\nYou&apos;d be hard-pressed to find a nicer girl than &quot;Trinna,&quot; played by the 20-year-old Young who was already into making her 50th movie! (She started acting as a small child. That, and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days.) The camera, although in soft focus throughout much of the film, zoomed in on Loretta&apos;s face and eyes many times and I was mesmerized by her beauty.\n\nPlaying a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life, Tracy&apos;s &quot;Bill&quot; slowly transformed into a loving man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting.\n\nAlthough they have small roles, supporting actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75-minute film. I was particularly fascinated with Connolly&apos;s role as the minister/father figure of the camp.\n\nThe story is a little far-fetched but - hey - that&apos;s the movies. This story is about two lonely Great Depression victims trying to survive in a &quot;Hooverville&quot;-type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale.",

I found this one to be a much better film than the last one as it contained a bit more interesting footage in it.

      "reviewBody": "This is the best performance of the Requiem that I have ever heard ; I do not expect to find its equal during my lifetime.\n\nVon Karajan, a perfectionist of ferocious repute, liked to run a very tight ship. Here too the performance is planned, regulated, ordered, supervised and controlled to within an inch of its life. It is a testament to the genius of van Karajan that the music does not die, but springs into rich and vibrant life instead. This Requiem does all, and more, that the Requiem is supposed to do - it dazzles, it astounds, it moves, it charms, it chills, it transports, it examines crucial moral and intellectual questions - and it does so at a level most other executions can only dream of.\n\nIn short : this comes as close to perfection as is humanly possible.\n\nAll four of the soloists bring their own unique qualities and characteristics to the table : Ghiaurov sings like a melancholy angel, while Pavarotti contributes a warm humanity, Price an imperial dignity and Cossotto a deep, ringing conviction.\n\nIt&apos;s almost an act of vandalism to pick out a favorite from among such an abundance of talent, but still : I prefer Cossotto. Her combination of clarity and conviction turns her into someone who is speaking of things which are (or will become) absolutely certain and true. (Think, for example, of a judge saying &quot;You will be taken to your cell ; and there you will remain until the day the executioner will lead you to the gallows&quot; or of a doctor saying &quot;Now that the victim has ingested so much cyanide, he is beyond medical help&quot;.) It is at times deeply unsettling, as if listening to a prophetess - perhaps the &quot;Sybil&quot; of which the text speaks ? Or, even more dreadful, as if listening to someone who has actually returned from the dead.\n\nBuy, borrow, steal or beg a copy of this masterwork ; if necessary, throw in a few months&apos; pay. The &quot;Liber scriptus&quot;, &quot;Ingemisco&quot; and &quot;Mors stupebit&quot; alone are worth the effort.",

      "reviewBody": "Operation Mad Ball is a peculiar combination of MASH and McHale&apos;s Navy, taking some of the best elements of both tried and true military service comedies. Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs are a pair of beautifully matched antagonists.\n\nIt&apos;s France after VE Day and our army is just an army of occupation now and awaiting orders either for home or may be the Pacific Theater. Jack Lemmon would like to throw a big blowout for everyone before they all separate. But the killjoy of the proceedings is Ernie Kovacs who is a petty martinet and constantly getting in the way of all Lemmon&apos;s schemes the way Captain Binghamton used to do with Lieutenant Commander McHale. And sad to say he doesn&apos;t have an island at his disposal where he could ship McHale off to the way Joe Flynn exiled Ernie Borgnine and the rest of his PT Crew.\n\nThere&apos;s a little bit of Frank Burns on Kovacs&apos;s character as well as he tries to do things the military way while the commanding officer Arthur O&apos;Connell is a doctor who just wants to run a hospital. See what happens at the beginning when Kovacs tries to court martial Lemmon and how O&apos;Connell just gets out of it.\n\nBut the main problem is getting the party together without Kovacs finding out about it. Lemmon is nothing if not resourceful and his main problems is getting women for the party. What&apos;s a party without them, but the only women available are the nurses and the army&apos;s seen fit to commission them bringing in that pesky no fraternization rule. That in fact is what almost got Lemmon that court martial as Kovacs thought he was getting to familiar with Kathryn Grant. After all that was territory he had staked out and no enlisted man was going to move in on him.\n\nLook for a nice performance by Mickey Rooney in the small role of a human encyclopedia running a port facility, a key guy in Lemmon&apos;s plans. And you haven&apos;t lived until you&apos;ve heard an extremely bad version of In The Mood done on harmonica and ocarina. Good thing Glenn Miller had died before listening to this.\n\nOperation Mad Ball sad to say is too little seen these days. It&apos;s a great introduction to those who want to study the comedic art of Jack Lemmon. Try not to miss it when broadcast.",

      "reviewBody": "What a delightful surprise this little movie turned out to be! I had read in Michael Weldon&apos;s &quot;Psychotronic Encyclopedia&quot; that &quot;The Man Who Changed His Mind&quot; was a seldom-seen Karloff film that was considered to be quite excellent, but until last night had never seen it before. The film turns out to be a beautifully done piece on the by-now-overdone theme of mind/body transfer. It is impeccably acted by the entire cast, features gorgeous black-and-white photography and great use of shadow, stylish direction, more-than-adequate effects and a witty script. The picture really does MOVE; there are no wasted scenes or sluggish passages to speak of whatsoever. Anna Lee, who would costar with Karloff again 10 years later in the 1946 picture &quot;Bedlam,&quot; is excellent (and beautiful) here as Karloff&apos;s assistant, and the actor Frank Cellier almost steals the film as the lord and publisher who receives the mind of Karloff&apos;s wheelchair-bound helper. But the film belongs to Karloff, and he runs with it. This may very well be his best film of the 1930s, with the exception of the Franky films and &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; of course, and that&apos;s really saying something. Fans of classic horror should all rejoice that this terrific and relatively unknown example of British &apos;30s horror is now widely available in a pristine-looking DVD. To be succinct...loved it.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s odd that this pre-Code morality tale was withdrawn by Paramount shortly after release, considering that despite its salacious content it pointed out that the girl at the center was capable of noble redemption. However that may be, &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; works well on its own terms as a story about a flirtatious Southern belle (Miriam Hopkins in one of her best performances) whose behavioral excesses get her into a mighty mess with a band of bootleggers, including a character named Trigger (Jack LaRue in a role George Raft refused) and an embittered harridan interestingly played by Florence Eldridge (real life wife of Fredric March). Both actors benefit from Karl Struss&apos;s evocative photography. \n\nDirector Stephen Roberts and screenwriter Oliver H.P. Garrett do their early 30&apos;s best to cinematize a complicated novel (by William Faulkner) by crunching long passages of text into visually suggestive nuggets. The trouble with the gang of ne&apos;er-do-wells is that none of them have even a twinge of a southern twang except James Eagles as the dimwitted Tommy. Besides him, the only key actor with even a slight southern accent in the whole film is Hopkins. William Gargan contrasts perfectly with the criminals as the clean-cut lawyer who loves and defends Hopkins despite her dark side. The drama builds to a breathless, memorable conclusion, concisely shot and directed for maximum effect.",

      "reviewBody": "For many many years I wanted to see this movie, a film you never get to see on TV or at a Visconti retrospective at the NFT or one of the Curzon cinemas here in London. Perhaps it is so because this film has been so much underrated by critics and public that it drags far behind the director&apos;s most famous and praised works (The Leopard, Rocco, La Terra Trema, etc). \n\nI read in a biography of the director that &quot;Ludwig&quot; was a mammoth project that took four production companies from different countries to put up the budget, it obsessed and consumed Visconti to the the extent of almost killing him when he suffered a stroke as a result of long working hours and too much mental strain, went well over schedule and budget and finally was taken away from the author&apos;s hands by the producers and butchered and re-edited in order to make it shorter, simpler and more viably commercial. The result was a mess almost half of the length of the original and with a lot of key scenes missing, presenting an inconsistent story full of plot holes and with characters appearing now and then from nowhere. It took several years after Visconti&apos;s death for his usual collaborators (d&apos;Amico, Nanuzzi) to gather the missing sequences and re-edit the film into a cut as close to Visconti&apos;s idea as it could be. The result is a a DVD edition of 228 minutes. This movie, visually speaking, is with &quot;Death in Venice&quot; probably Visconti&apos;s most beautiful,lavish and rich in colours and small details. As to the story, I agree with other viewers on the fact that it is a bit too overlong and it drags at places and some sequences could have been shorter without the plot missing anything. But then it seems like Visconti deliberately wanted to give it that sedate pacing in order to suit the dreamlike mental state of the protagonist during his reclusion in his castles and his lapses into his own fantasy world. In order to understand better Ludwig&apos;s personality I read one of his many biographies after watching the movie for the first time, and then I watched it again, and I could appreciate better Visconti&apos;s approach to the character. I think this is a movie worth of its director, and even with its flaws and extreme length it deserves better criticism and appreciation than it unfairly got since it first came out in 1972.\n\nHelmut Berger is quite good here and has a remarkable resemblance to the real Ludwig, Romy Schneider is as beautiful as ever and the real Bavarian locations are breathtaking. The night sequence with Ludwig and Elizabeth riding in the snowy forest in the moonlight is one of the most beautiful and romantic I have ever seen in film. The cinematography alone makes &quot;Ludwig&quot; worth watching if you like beautiful things. \n\nHopefully this movie has gained some appreciation and seems to be getting better reviews nowadays that it did in the past. Many call it Visconti&apos;s lost masterpiece. Although I don&apos;t think it is one of his greatest works thematically speaking, it surely stands among the most beautiful and lyrical and it is one of my favourite choices for a long winter evening.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, I didn&apos;t really want to see this movie at all. I work at a theater, and I was forced to watch this with my boss so I could talk with her about the promotion I&apos;ve wanted for a very long time. By the time the credits rolled, &quot;Molly Hartley&quot; had injected me with insane predictability, zero plot, and good looking people to the point where I almost didn&apos;t want said promotion anymore.\n\nLike I&apos;ve already mentioned twice, the film&apos;s best and only strong point is the amount of good looking people in the movie. Even the geeky character is good looking. Haley Bennett manages to carry the movie in decent fashion, avoiding becoming laughable as most PG-13 horror movie heroines do *glares at Camilla Belle*. Chace Crawford was a presence I could have done without, while Shannon Woodward was the best performer (and had the best character) in the movie as Leah.\n\nI will give this movie a bit of credit for not being formulaic for about 75% of the movie...while it avoids typical clichés most of the time, it arrives at a conclusion so obvious, stupid, rushed, and unfinished that you can&apos;t help but wonder who allowed this movie to be made. It doesn&apos;t go for cheap jump scares, which I appreciated, and is more of a satanic thriller than a straight up horror movie. Of course, it&apos;s my feeling that PG-13 horror movies not named &quot;The Ring&quot; are just as bad as the Disaster/Date/Superhero Movie franchise, but Molly Hartley manages to barely avoid being as disastrous as Prom Night or When A Stranger Calls. Don&apos;t take that as a compliment. It&apos;s very easy to beat those movies.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be the fact that the movie basically has no plot. We just follow Molly Hartley around aimlessly as the evidence of her being the hottest devil child ever builds up, and then &quot;BAM&quot;, an epic fail of an ending comes, scroll goes the credits, and SMACK goes the sound of heads hitting desks. Whoever greenlit this movie is on crack, and I&apos;m not joking.\n\nPlease don&apos;t waste your time.",

      "reviewBody": "Words almost fail me in talking about how much I love this film, this very funny, very stylish portrayal of what was considered the robbery of the last century.\n\nFirst of all it could never have been done earlier. J. Edgar Hoover was not a figure to be satirized before May of 1972 when he breathed his last. Sheldon Leonard who plays him here and has him get it all wrong about who pulled the Brink&apos;s Armored Car Robbery, would not have taken the role, neither would any other actor. No one wanted to be on that man&apos;s bad side. Hoover was not quite the figure you see Leonard play here, though Leonard is fine in the part. Books and films subsequent to his death still really haven&apos;t got it quite right about him.\n\nFor all of J. Edgar&apos;s fulminations about the great Communist conspiracy at work in the Brink&apos;s job, the whole point of The Brink&apos;s Job is who actually did it. Six very ordinary street criminals, none of them violent felons in any way and one fence who declared himself in on the job.\n\nThe group is headed by Peter Falk who should have been Oscar nominated for his portrayal of Tony Pino, the group&apos;s leader and planner. You see The Brink&apos;s Job, Peter Falk will remain with you forever. A man without complications and hangups, he&apos;s a thief because it&apos;s his profession. He does have pride in how good he is though.\n\nSome of Falk&apos;s best scenes are with his wife Gena Rowlands. She too is a woman who stands by her man. No doubt they came from the same hardscrabble background in Boston&apos;s Italian North End and she&apos;s completely supportive of him and his work. In particular I love the scene where she&apos;s bidding him off to work just like any other wife who&apos;s husband had a night job. Don&apos;t forget your screwdriver, here&apos;s a sandwich in case you get hungry, the scene is priceless.\n\nI also love the scene in the restaurant where he takes her after a nice score. Falk is at the height of his considerable talents as he tells Rowlands of his plans for the Brink&apos;s Armored Car Company.\n\nWhat everyone will love when they see this film is how comparatively easy it was for these knockabout guys from Boston to accomplish stealing over 4 million dollars. This score was so big, it HAD to be the work of a master criminal mind. The thing is it was, the mind was just not in a body where you would expect it to be found.\n\nThe others in the mob are Paul Sorvino, Kevin O&apos;Connor, Warren Oates, Gerard Murphy and Peter Boyle who plays the fence. But my favorite in the mob and in the film is Allen Garfield who plays Falk&apos;s brother-in-law and sidekick who Falk keeps around for laughs. They have an Abbott&amp;Costello like relationship with everything Garfield touches turning to waste product. My favorite scene in the whole film is when they decide to rob a gum factory payroll. Poor Garfield accidentally presses the wrong switch and he&apos;s awash in gumballs. Falk&apos;s and Sorvino&apos;s differing reactions are priceless.\n\nA lot of the film was shot in Boston which in many ways is a city that tries more than most to keep it&apos;s traditional look. I haven&apos;t been in that city in about five years, but I daresay you could remake The Brink&apos;s Job today in the same area.\n\nBut if you did it wouldn&apos;t be as good, that isn&apos;t possible.",

      "reviewBody": "The 60s were a strange time for cinema – a flourishing of surreal, psychedelic, political and often pretentious film-making. And yet the figures and ideals of the previous generation – Hollywood&apos;s golden age – were still around, and neither had they been totally forgotten by the younger generation. Finian&apos;s Rainbow was quite literally a remnant from that bygone era, having been an acclaimed stage musical in the 1940s. Had it not been for its controversial subject matter it would probably have been produced for screen in the 50s. As it was, the eventual film adaptation found itself an old-time song-and-dance show in an era where the musical had become something very different indeed.\n\nIn a way Finian&apos;s Rainbow was always a mix-and-match musical. The E.Y. Harburg-Burton Lane score blends Broadway brass with Irish jigs and occasionally gospel to surprising success. The story also places old-world folklore alongside contemporary racial issues, in what is a sometimes awkward but generally passable modern-day fairytale. Aside from anything else, the Lane melodies are of considerable beauty and the Harburg lyrics witty enough that it makes a broadly appealing and timeless package. Fans of the inventive wordplay in the numbers from Wizard of Oz, which were also penned by Harburg, will appreciate such clever twists as &quot;Make him a better person not a worse &apos;un&quot; Harburg even reuses the word &quot;individdle&quot;, here rhyming it with fiddle, having rhymed it with riddle in Oz.\n\nAnother relic of the old days appears in the form of Fred Astaire as the titular Finian. Astaire may be lacking his cane and topper, he may be showing the signs of his age a little, and his accent may be about as authentically Irish as a gift-shop Shillelagh – but it&apos;s still the same old Fred, full of the effortless dance-steps and easygoing charm that won over audiences thirty-five years earlier. It&apos;s a real delight to see him here, partly because his endearing demeanour is so reassuringly familiar, and yet he still makes an honest attempt to deviate from his regular persona to create this crusty yet lovable old Irishman. Representing the new is a fresh-faced Tommy Steele, playing the leprechaun Og. A certain proportion of Steele&apos;s performance, say 10%, is pure brilliance. Unfortunately the remaining 90% is pure annoyance, as Steele grins and capers his way maddeningly through some disappointingly flat renditions of the Harburg-Lane numbers. Still, he does appear to have struck some kind of unlikely rapport with Astaire, and their scenes together are among the most brightly comical.\n\nThe director was from the young side of the fence. Francis Ford Coppola was a graduate of Roger Corman&apos;s schlock factory, and this was his first big-budget assignment. Coppola had already demonstrated himself to be a director who took a detached and distant view of things, often keeping his camera high above the action or peeping from amongst foreground foliage. Oddly enough this sets him up well for the light and abstract world of the musical, in which the broad canvas, rich detail and ensemble are more important than the intense close-up or the dramatic long take. Coppola shows real sensitivity to the music, keeping rhythms going with natural-looking background movement – check out the way the crowd shifts behind Petula Clark and Don Francks during &quot;Look to the Rainbow&quot;. He also uses his harmonious technique to draw attention to the lyrics, for example having the camera pan up to the heavens on the line &quot;Skies could be so bluish blue&quot; in &quot;Something Sort of Grandish&quot;.\n\nThe conventions of the time and the sensibilities of the young production team have certainly left their mark on Finian&apos;s Rainbow. There are many thinly-veiled references to hippy and protest culture, with the &quot;tobacco&quot;-growing enterprise, a business-like police force and even a sit-down, in a reasonable attempt to make this a musical equivalent of In the Heat of the Night. However the difference between the old and the new is too stark for them to fuse. Coppola&apos;s penchant for realism results in some stunning outdoor photography, but this only grates all the more with the woefully fake-looking studio &quot;forest&quot;, the like of which would now only be seen in a kid&apos;s TV show. Most of the components are glorious, but as a whole it is occasionally like watching two separate films spliced together.\n\nHowever, Finian&apos;s Rainbow is at least self-aware enough to realise that it has the opportunity to be a respectful homage to the classic musical, and never descends into a roughshod &quot;update&quot;. The most profound and emotionally stirring aspect of the picture is that Astaire evidently knew it would be his last appearance as a dancer. Coppola surely knew it too, and the tender staging of Astaire&apos;s final scene is among the most poignant moments of self-reference in movie history.",

With juggling the duties of mother and father,Ivan has his anxiety about failure;He needs a great &quot;rave&quot; review to have a broadway hit.\n\nThere are sensitive lines in the film that touch on Ivan&apos;s personality; I am moved to the same anger, when He tells ex-wife Gloria  &quot;we are not fish,we are people&quot;.Gloria seems to be self-centered and uncaring.Travalian also says to his biological son,Igor, &quot;nobody wants them,Gloria doesn&apos;t want them&quot;. How can we not feel the pain in these hurting kids?\n\n The movie was great and touched on the aspect of family and Love;Ivan has these kids of the world, and tries to make a home for them.I love this film and enjoyed it heartily."

      "name": "Sly Indian versus a Handful of Soldiers or the Magnificent Goiko Mitic: Part Twelve",
      "reviewBody": "Western. Production picture of the East German film studio DEFA, created with the participation of socialist Mongolia, where the main role was played by the famous Yugoslav actor, &quot;Honored Indian of the Soviet Union&quot;, Goiko Mitic. The last, that is, the twelfth, picture of twelve, which I looked at and revised. And I can say for sure that this particular western I watched for sure when it was played on TV in the middle of zero during the New Year&apos;s holidays on Channel One (then it had not yet slipped into dullness and emptiness). And here&apos;s my brief opinion - a cunning Indian against a handful of soldiers. I will say right away that there are no downsides to the picture, but I personally have several comments that I will highlight in a separate paragraph, but for now, let your humble servant focus your attention on the obvious advantages of this western. So, here they are: 1. Scenario - the picture tells the story of the noble and cunning leader White Feather, played by Goiko Mitic, who intends to use a cunning way to return the herd of stolen horses that is guarded by a small detachment of the American army. He uses all his abilities in order to succeed in this. The soldiers are shown as absolutely ordinary people, with their own fears and shortcomings, and this is exactly what the brave hero needs to use. The script turned out with twists typical for this series, so connoisseurs will quickly understand what&apos;s what, but for new viewers it will be a useful and interesting experience. The finale is certainly predictable, but this does not make it less spectacular and exciting. 2. Nature - the picture was filmed in Mongolia, which is very noticeable, but I will strongly pretend that this is a prairie near the Rocky Mountains in the USA. The beauty of nature fascinates the viewer, and the cameraman focuses our attention on the most memorable shots. Mountains, rivers, prairies - how you want to move there and walk along them, sitting on a horse. Leave worries and daily routines. Oh, what a beauty! Lyapota! 3. Entourage - atmosphere, decorations and costumes - apart from one comment, everything is at a good level. Indians look like Indians, American soldiers look like American soldiers, there are very few decorations here, but they also look according to historical prototypes. Well, everything is fine with the atmosphere, if you close your eyes to one remark. 4. Music - atmospheric, with a clear touch of Indian themes (which was required), there are quite a few musical compositions themselves, but my language will not turn out to say that this is not enough. It will be difficult to listen to this music separately and will hardly succeed, but within the framework of the picture - exactly what you need. 5. Fights, chases, skirmishes - there are not many of them here, because the lion&apos;s share of these scenes falls on the final of the picture, and so we just observe the journey of a handful of soldiers and a cunning Indian from one point to another. The shooting scenes turned out to be dynamic. A little about the main characters: 1. White Feather performed by Goiko Mitic - the leader of the &quot;pierced noses&quot; tribe, who by a cunning way intends to return the stolen herd of horses, for which he turns an interesting combination. Brave, smart and damn convincing. Goiko again perfectly performed all the tricks on his own, not forgetting to show an excellent acting game. Bravo Goiko! 2. Klaus Manchen&apos;s Sergeant Anderson is the most memorable of a handful of American warriors. An experienced officer who understands Indians, which helps the detachment more than once. Honest, completely without ambition - a classic campaigner, whose role is played damn well by Klaus. Bravo! 3. Major Bennigen performed by Milan Beli (our compatriot) is the commander of the ill-fated detachment, an extremely upstart and incompetent officer who more interferes than leads the detachment to the task. Milan played this hero very convincingly. Now about the comments. The fact is that the role of the Indians was played by Mongolian actors, and this is striking, pardon the pun. And now it looks funny, to put it mildly, because earlier the role of the Indians was played by Germans, Romanians, and so on, which are very similar in appearance to historical types, but here it went to the devil, which greatly affects the atmosphere. Well, the scenes of fights, chases and skirmishes today no longer cause those enthusiastic emotions as in the year the picture was released, but we will make a discount on the time of release. Well, that ended a kind of marathon of Westerns by the DEFA film studio with Goiko Mitic. Yes, I know that there is also a picture &quot;Hunters on the Prairie of Mexico&quot; in 1988, but I will not watch it any more, I have already looked at twelve pictures, and that&apos;s almost all. All of them enjoyed tremendous success in the Soviet Union and gathered a record number of spectators, it was the roles of noble Indians that glorified Yugoslav Goyko Mitic, and millions of boys throughout the Union played &quot;Indians&quot;, as I happened once. Of course, in these westerns, the Indians are always displayed in the best possible side, although in life this was far from the case. Pale-faced people are truthfully shown, where there were both good people and not so much. The struggle of the Indians was shown selflessly, although the advantage, especially in technology and numbers, was not in their favor. Goiko Mitic had a chance to play the roles as literary characters, like Chingachguk, and real ones, like Ulzana or Tekumze, and in any of these roles he was great. The lion&apos;s share of success was based on Goiko&apos;s charisma and his languid gaze of a proud eagle. I watched some of these westerns as a child, some saw only now, and now it&apos;s time to choose my favorites. These will be: 1. Trail of the Falcon. 1968 - who discovered this series for me 2. Brotherhood by blood. 1975 - for excellent music and nature 3. Severino. 1978 - for the peace-loving Goiko Mitic and excellent music. For myself, I decided to watch the series &quot;Archive of Death&quot; in 1980, where Goiko Mitic plays a Soviet intelligence officer, because I want to look at him not only as an Indian. I am glad that I was able to get acquainted and refresh in my memory this series of westerns, which are in no way inferior to Western ones, and rightfully occupy their high place in the history of world cinema. As a result, we have a good western with the inimitable Gojko Mitic, excellent script, atmospheric music, great nature and great acting work.",

I know that a sailor would never get away with direct disobedience of an Officer&apos;s order as Palladino did without severe consequences during WWII. The underwater scenes were weak and the models just passable. Must not have had a real submariner for Technical Adviser....be I did get the feeling that the leaky, squirting episodes represented the condition of an old boat. The German sailors, on the other hand, seemed more realistic. For that matter, I doubt that the US Sailors could have put up much of an offense."

She uses the power of suggestion, switching their actual horoscopes by mail that they receive from a swami with predictions of doom. One by one, the women die. She ultimately knocks off the swami and turns her sights on the disbeliever of the group, played by Irene Dunne.\n\nLoy would soon break free from exotica with &quot;The Thin Man&quot; series. Mrs. Laurence Olivier at the time, Jill Esmond, appears in the film, as do Ricardo Cortez and Peg Entwhistle. For Entwhistle, the dire predictions in the film played out in real life for her. Shortly after this movie was made, she achieved a lasting fame by committing suicide by jumping from the &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; sign in Los Angeles.",

All of them the Korean resistance, the Japanese army and some thieves want the precious &quot;Light of The East&quot; the way they get it will be fun to watch. The resistance is a couple of people who doesn&apos;t do anything right, and a thief is giving the police and the army headaches. Entertaining enough with decent story and acting i recommend to the fans of the adventure comedy movies.",

When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can&apos;t possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it&apos;s the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it&apos;s been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that&apos;s somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . \n\nSuspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood&apos;s usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with ¨The Neverending story¨ and ¨Das Boot¨ ,after that , he emigrated US where realized ¨Night of shattered crystals¨, ¨Enemy mine¨ , and the successful ¨Air Force one¨and ¨The patriot¨ , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake ¨Poseidon¨. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .",

He started off the year by teaming with Robert De Niro (who was reinventing himself as a comic actor) in this Buddy Cop Picture.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Two very different cops are forced to team up on a new reality based television cop show, while tracking down the manufacturer and distributor of an illegally made semi-automatic firearm.\n\nIt starts off well (especially the first 30 minuted or so) and I was enjoying myself. Sadly, it ends up becoming the type of movies it is making fun of. So it&apos;s early promise is not fully lived up to, but I still liked it.\n\nThere is decent chemistry between the two leads. Every good scene in this movie features De Niro and Murphy. Usually without specially effects or action. William Shatner shows up to give Murphy and De Niro acting tips which is a lot of fun. \n\nAll in all, it&apos;s an enjoyable action comedy for me. \n\nShowtime ended 2002 as the 70th highest grossing movie of the year, with a domestic haul of $38 million dollars. Against an $85 million budget."

I enjoyed the audience even more than I enjoyed the movie. And I enjoyed the movie a lot.\n\nP.S. Taylor Mead should be made a saint.

In the end we found out that the larger part of the movie had been filmed in the Czech republic. (Rosenmüller needed an old farm that was in a bad shape!) So it was a good movie with some fake local colour, but the actors were genuine Bavarians with a genuine dialect!\n\nKneißl himself certainly was no Bavarian version of Robin Hood, but a petty criminal who was framed by a local policeman when he was released after his first prison sentence.

Where this was filmed is unclear, but seems to be not far from Vietnam, a world Bourguignon would return to.\n\nThe music, from Georges Delerue, is quite distinct and will strike viewers immediately. Delerue may not be a well-known name, but even American audiences have probably heard his work in such films as &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986) and &quot;Twins&quot; (1988).",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this film at Noordelijk Filmfestival 2011 (in Leeuwarden, province of Friesland NL). Reading about Greece almost daily in our newspapers, each film about that country will be watched through subjective eyes. Particularly in this case, we cannot overlook the twofold (!) satirical elements embedded in the story. Firstly, we see how some Greek people live and spend their time, doing not very much. Even worse, they seem not to worry about that. Secondly, we see the gradual invasion of Albanian and Chinese people, apparently enterprising and busy with useful work. The discrepancy cannot be demonstrated better. However, it may possibly be construed as painful for those in Greece who really pull their weight.\n\nOn the other hand, though tempting it may be, my inclination to see a connection with today&apos;s economic crisis in the EU, may not be the main intention of the film makers. It is rather an open invitation to consider it applicable to life in Greece in general. I have that from a trustworthy source: An introductory speech by the director&apos;s wife (who happened to be here for another film), emphasized that the satirical elements applied to years before the current crisis as well.\n\nThere is no useful purpose in condensing the story here in a few sentences. Several complications form the core of the plot, causing surprising things to happen throughout the film. Many hilarious scenes make up an additional substance that succeeds in keeping our attention. Even those not interested in politics or social-economics, can watch and appreciate this film on other merits.\n\nIt may seem a bit long to take 103 minutes for the story to develop, but relevant scenes are distributed evenly and leave the intended impression. Anyway, the quiet tempo is appropriate for the Greek way of living, as showcased here very explicitly. An ingeniously constructed script, thanks to the mentally retarded mother who suddenly displays Albanian roots, provides for a strong story line. She is the unwilling cause that surprising things keep happening, without her mental state leading to uncomfortable moments for us viewers.\n\nAll in all, the insight it gave in the Greek way of living, be it intentionally satirical or not, confirmed suspicions we had all along. Same can be said about the visible presence of Chinese and Albanian people, with an apparently very different attitude against work. In the end, everything seems back to normal as far as the four neighbors are concerned. Or can it be that the past is not fully restored, and that some doubts remain? All things considered (script, acting, etc) I found enough reason to give a maximum score for the audience award when leaving the theater.",

With great acting and great storytelling, this is one of the best dutch movies ever. In my opinion, the only dutch movie that beats this one is Simon, but Alles Is Liefde is probably more for everyone. Following a lot of different story lines, it kind of resembles the best movie ever made, Magnolia ofcource, as stories get more and more emotional, and eventually you just find yourself crying at every damn scene. A beautiful movie about the moments in between. And a hilarious appearance of dutch comedians De Vliegende Panters :D.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Pit And The Pendulum&apos; sees  b-grade legend Roger Corman (&apos;Little Shop Of Horrors&apos;), talented suspense writer Richard Matheson (&apos;The Incredible Shrinking Man&apos;), and horror master Vincent Price (&apos;The Tingler&apos;) try and recreate the success of their first Poe adaptation &apos;House Of Usher&apos;. And they do so admirably, &apos;... Pendulum&apos; being even better than the excellent &apos;... Usher&apos;. Matheson cleverly expands upon Poe&apos;s original tale by also mixing in elements from the earlier movie, &apos;The Premature Burial&apos; and other Poe classics. John Kerr is the one weak link in this first rate thriller. An actor I&apos;m not familiar with, he is dull and not all that good. Much better is Antony Carbone (who Corman fans will recognize from &apos;A Bucket Of Blood&apos;) as Price&apos;s doctor pal, and the underrated Luana Anders (&apos;Dementia 13&apos;, &apos;Easy Rider&apos;) as Price&apos;s sister. Price himself is wonderful as usual as the tormented Don Medina, and an added bonus is the appearance of enduring cult figure, and one of the most beautiful actresses in movie history, Barbara Steele (&apos;Black Sunday&apos;, &apos;Shivers&apos;). Steele doesn&apos;t get as much screen time as one would wish but it&apos;s a joy to see her work alongside Price, sadly their only movie together. &apos;Pit And The Pendulum&apos; is one of Corman&apos;s best horror movies, and one that will surprise many viewers today with just how atmospheric and creepy it still is. An extremely underrated film (as are Corman&apos;s other 60s Poe adaptations), and one that is a must see for all horror buffs. Highly recommended."

The plot of the film, involving two boxers fighting over a girl, is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it. Hitchcock&apos;s talent, though, is found in his stunning use of images.  Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols.  Especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer.  He slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement Hitch has shown us all we need to know.  The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was.  The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women.  The object of the boxers&apos; desires is driven by money and lust, not reason or love.  The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships.  All in all, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock&apos;s early work and his development as a visual storyteller.",

To add to the dark shadow over this film, Elvis&apos; lovely and tolented young co-star, Judy Tyler, died before this film was released (I believe it was a car accident, but I could be wrong).  Elvis was pretty broke up about it, and so am I. Well, enough said, it&apos;s got the classic &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; number (often excerpted and included in TV retrospectives on Elvis), with some pretty smooth dance moves revealed by the often immobile Elvis.  E really shines in this one; one of his best films.",

The locals told me about the movie, I had only a vague knowledge before then.\n\nWhat has really sold me on the movie was the DVD edition we viewed it on. There is a wealth of details about the movie, the director, the island, and much more now available.

      "reviewBody": "I will go on record as stating Fulci has only done 4 movies...the Beyond, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, and Zombie2....everything else is trash and a poor excuse for cinema. I say this only because CrossClub opens with a dedication to Lucio Fulci...only this film seems to mimic those unmentionable films that Fucli has done. Now don&apos;t get me wrong...I&apos;m not saying that this film is trash...rather I am saying it is up there with Bad...bad Fulci...I&apos;m talking Black Cat, House of Clocks, Voices from Beyond...etc. I don&apos;t like Fulci and this film follows his lead which leads to my distaste. Further, I see so much independent German Horror that I tend to expect a bit more from releases...particularly on the XT or X-Rated Labels. This film may be a good entry into German Underground if you have not seen any films or only a few imports...it will set the standard of what to expect and test you on what you can tolerate. Basically done on a no Budget premise, the film deals with a satanic sacrifice gone wrong and interrupted by armed troops...the kid to be sacrificed is rescued; grows up and then yep...zombies... The acting and costume is bad...but give them credit they tried and created wardrobes on what they had. Like many of the German films the natural sets and locations are amazing and brilliant; a beautiful background to the horror on the film. The story though like many in the genre is weak...But again..it&apos;s not that bad and really is for true fans...if you&apos;ve seen a lot of the underground films you can skip this one it is nothing new; however, if you are new to the genre this is an easy import to find and is a good example of whats to come your way if you continue on in your search for obscure foreign horror.",

The script is funny at times and slow at others. All the scenes involving food and especially the ones with the chef Primo are great. The only let-down was the last twenty minutes where everything seemed to fall apart. The entire cast (especially the vastly underrated Campbell Scott) does a great job. There&apos;s a great scene with Minnie Driver in the sea coming out all wet - hot! Another great food movie I recall is Babette&apos;s Feast. That was more religion-drama and not comedy though. The style of this film is faintly reminiscent of Woody Allen. This film will appeal to all Louis Prima fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Face Behind the Mask, The (1941) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nPeter Lorre&apos;s excellent performance highlights this entertaining, if predictable, melodrama from Columbia and director Florey. In the film Lorre plays Janos Szabo, a immigrant who comes to America to earn enough money to bring the woman he loves over so that they can be married. Soon after his arrival his face is horrible disfigured in a hotel fire and he gets to see the ugly side of the country because no one will give him a job or even look at him. He eventually meets a friend (George E. Stone) who talks him into a life of crime so that he can raise enough money to get a new face but soon he meets a blind woman (Evelyn Keyes) who might make him think differently. There&apos;s a lot of plot going on in this film but there&apos;s no denying that Lorre gives an incredible performance and it makes this thing worth viewing no matter how predictable the screenplay is. There&apos;s really nothing here that will come out of left field as we get Lorre&apos;s character built up as such a great guy and then we get the accident and then we get the crime and of course he&apos;d just happen to meet a blind girl, which itself turns into a couple more predictable moments. One doesn&apos;t mind this as the film does have some very good moments including the actual fire sequence as well as the aftermath when Lorre finally sees his new face. As for Lorre, there&apos;s no question this here is one of his strongest performances as we believe him as the good guy getting off the ship and we can also believe him and the anger of what has happened to him. I think the film would have benefited from his bad side behind a lot darker than the film allows but I&apos;m sure this was watered down so that the romance side of things could flourish. Keyes is also very good in his role as the blind girl and Stone, best known for his Boston Blackie films, is very good as well. Don Beddoe adds nice support as the cop who helps Lorre and James Seay is nice as the rival. Florey&apos;s direction is very good throughout and especially during some of the darker moments right after the accident. The director does a pretty good job at handling the various aspects of this film and pulls everything together well enough to keep the film going. This is a good film but not a classic one. I think with a little tinkering of the script we could have had something even better but as is, it&apos;s great to see Lorre in a role he can do so much with."

I am no fan of musicals, but as I was watching this film it occurred to me what I don&apos;t like about American musicals  I don&apos;t like the &quot;Broadway Show Tune&quot; music. Somehow this music seemed appropriate to the film; the story is &quot;over the top&quot; and fits the music of this Bollywood musical. I was actually tapping my foot to the musical numbers.\n\nAs far as I&apos;m concerned this film is what a musical should be. The action scenes are great, but for me, the musical scenes were better. For those of you who may say there is no singing in an action film, go see this one to see how it&apos;s done. Singing, dancing -- and guns! Hooray for Bollywood!"

It is one of the few film that gave me a history lesson as well as complete entertainment. I really didn&apos;t notice the Cinematography or even the music. the story was encapsulating,and albeit fiction,had that real aura that made you think that something identical or very close ,has actually happened. The young Schlomo was excellent as was the mother-in fact I really couldn&apos;t find a weak performance. If you liked The Last Emperor or Dances with Wolves this movie should have a similar effect. I know quite a lot about both the countries involved in this story and I thought the director was flawless in portraying each culture. He was also flawless in taking you down one path, and just when you thought it was safe and predictable-he would rush you to another, surprising, even better place. It taught me things I didn&apos;t know and brought out emotions that have been dormant a while. A stimulating,informative masterpiece.",

His general presence was missed, he kept everyone grounded.\n\nIn all honesty this movie has lost some of the charm of the series that made it quirky and dark. I am not saying it&apos;s bad, I just think they could have done so much better with how long this has been in production.\n\nAnd to anyone who may quip that I am looking to find fault I watched the series when it had it&apos;s run on TV and bought the DVD&apos;s when they came out. I love the series as much as the next person and I want to see it picked up again but not at the expense of the story and the ideals that made the series what it was.",

      "reviewBody": "In some ways, &quot;Le Notti Bianche&quot; is a strange film for me. On one hand, it has some of the best cinematography you&apos;ll ever see in a black &amp; white film. The composition, the lighting, the mist--it all is so perfect. Yet, on the other hand, the story itself is so slight that I felt very unfulfilled at its conclusion.\n\nThe film begins with a lonely man wandering about the waterfront late at night. Although you&apos;d think a guy that looks like Marcello Mastroianni would not have trouble finding a relationship, but in this film he is quite alone. By chance, he meets a very strange woman (Maria Schell). She is VERY shy--and behaves a bit oddly. However, despite this, he vows to stop by the same place they met and see her, if she wants, the following night. From this very inauspicious beginning, two lonely people meet and form a friendship....and perhaps more. Eventually, you understand some of her weird behaviors--she&apos;s actually waiting for another man (Jean Marais)--a man who you assume will never come.\n\nThere really is NOT a lot more to the film than my description. It isn&apos;t a bad film but I wanted more. I liked Mastroianni&apos;s character (though he was a sad fellow) but found Schell&apos;s perplexing and hard to believe. I also thought their relationship a bit hard to believe as well--going from total strangers to talking about marriage WAY too fast. In fact, the story itself was only okay--but the film earns a 7 simply for its look. Not a particularly enjoyable or engaging film for me--and it receives a very, very mild recommendation from me.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; takes a look at Hollywood. This incisive take about how movies are made, directed by Vincente Minnelli, dares to go behind the scenes to show what goes on in the way the film industry operates. The film adaptation by Charles Schnee gives us a good idea of that unreal world of fantasy and hype.\n\nAt the center of the story is Jonathan Shields, a young man with connections to the industry. He wants to follow his father&apos;s footsteps and goes at it vigorously, making friends and enemies along the way. Jonathan discovers he can be ruthless whenever he wants. His first victim is Fred Amiel, the talented director who Jonathan bypasses in favor of a more established one. Jonathan quickly forgets the friendship Fred and his wife showed him before becoming a big producer.\n\nThen there is there is Georgia Larrion, the boozy daughter of a famous actor. Jonathan shows how he wants Georgia to succeed in the business, personally taking care of selling her to star in his big project, only to betray her with another woman, a glamorous bit player. When Georgia discovers the truth, she flees Jonathan&apos;s mansion in a clear night that suddenly turns into a torrential downpour and loses control of the car, but she doesn&apos;t suffer a scratch!\n\nThe last victim of Mr. Shields is the Pulitzer prize winner, James Lee Bartlow, who Jonathan coaxes into leaving his academic life to adapt his own novel for the movies. James is married to the flighty Rosemary, in whom Jonathan discovers a weak link that will do anything to hobnob with the celebrities. Jonathan makes it easy for Rosemary to fall into an affair with the star of Shields&apos; film.\n\nWhen we first watched this film, it seemed much better, than on this viewing where a lot of things surface to make some of the story much weaker than before. Some viewers have compared this film with the fate of Orson Welles in Hollywood, and there are a couple of references that could be interpreted that way. Whether it was so, or not, it&apos;s up to the viewer to guess where the truth lies.\n\nKirk Douglas gave a strong performance as Jonathan Shields. Mr. Douglas showed he clearly understood who this man was. He runs away with the film, in our humble opinion. Lana Turner, a beautiful presence in any movie, is good, but at times she appears to be overwhelmed by the range of emotions she has to project, especially with that phony car scene.\n\nDick Powell and Gloria Graham put in an excellent appearance as the Bartlows. Barry Sullivan disappears after Lana shows up, not to be seen until the end. Walter Pigeon is effective as the studio head. Gilbert Roland is perfect as Gaucho, the Latin actor with a lot of charisma.\n\nMr. Minnelli shows he wasn&apos;t afraid to portray the industry the way we see it in the film, not a small accomplishment, knowing well how it could have backfired on him. Hollywood is not forgiving to those who dare to show its ugly side and that&apos;s when the parallel with Orson Welles problems with the system and eventual exile can be drawn.",

      "reviewBody": "The Color of Money is a slick sequel to The Hustler where Paul Newman as a much younger man paid the price for hustling pool. Now, twenty some years later, his Fast Eddie Felson is driving around in a big fancy Cadillac selling liquor and stake-horsing younger pool players. One day, while romancing his bartender girlfriend, his young protégé (John Tuturro) gets whipped by this cocky kid named Vincent. Eddie Felson is immediately drawn to the flaky, loud-mouthed kid with the name &quot;Vince&quot; stenciled on his tee shirt. After some arm twisting and manipulating, Eddie, Vincent, and Vincent&apos;s streetwise girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are making their way to Atlantic City where a 9 Ball pool tournament awaits. Along they way Eddie tries to teach them how to hustle pool. This will be a problem because of course the cocky youngster won&apos;t do as he&apos;s told. He has a gift and knows it. It is simply impossible for him to hold back and let someone beat him. Even when it could lead to a bigger payoff down the road. His girlfriend Carmen also seems to see both Vincent and Eddie as a way to make money for herself. She is clearly a woman with motives all her own. Of course this will all lead up to a climatic match in Atlantic City between the old master and the young protégé, won&apos;t it? Well, it appears to for a moment, until we learn that what we saw wasn&apos;t really what it appeared to be.\n\nAnd that&apos;s the part of the film that seemed to really irk Roger Ebert in his review. He was expecting a masterpiece of a film for no other reason than Martin Scorcese is the director. But the film isn&apos;t a masterpiece. Its simply a very good film with some great performances, great music, and some gritty and authentic-looking locations. Who is the better pool player is the last thing this film is about. This is a film about people using other people. Be it for money, inspiration, comfort, you name it. Newman plays Felson here as a gruff, seasoned man who thinks he knows everything about the game, and those who play it. He finds out as the film moves along that is not always the case. Sometimes these younger players have new tricks up their sleeves, and if you let your guard down, they will hustle even the smartest old timer. There is a classic scene where Eddie, after a few too many drinks, allows a chubby and apparently dim-witted Forest Whitaker to take him for hundreds of dollars. The film is full of scenes that end in ways you don&apos;t quite expect.\n\nThis is one of those movies where above all else, the casting was almost perfect. Newman is as watchable as ever. Mastrantonio steals a few scenes. Cruise is annoying of course, but he was supposed to be. Still, he looks kind of weak compared to the other actors. Great support from Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs, too. Watch closely for an appearance from music icon Iggy Pop. During a montage, Cruise hustles him and then steals a shot of booze right out of his hand! The cinematography from Michael Ballhaus is great as always. In fact its too good! Some of the camera shots just look too stylish for such a film. Maybe that was Scorcese&apos;s way of trying to liven up a picture with so little violence! Overall, The Color of Money is worth your time. 8 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound",

      "reviewBody": "Jack Cutter (The Dragon) comes from a long line of vampire hunters. When he was just a kid, vampires attacked his family farmhouse. The Cutter family has a sacred book all about vampires and how to combat them. His family tells him &quot;don&apos;t trust anyone&quot;, and he is sent off to be on his own. In 1995, now an adult, Cutter has tracked and killed every vampire in existence - except an elite underground club of nine multiracial vamps, led by the sinister Brit Bruno (Guest). Cutter teams up with Raimy Baker (Smith), a reporter for the &quot;National Inquisitor&quot;. But can he get over his deep-seated trust issues? Can he avoid the cops and exterminate the last vampires on earth before the solar eclipse when they will gain maximum power? Will Jack live up to his nickname of &quot;The Hunter&quot;? Night Hunter is a Ring of Fire (1991) reunion of sorts, as Don The Dragon, Maria Ford, Ron Yuan and Vince Murdocco all return in front of the camera, and Rick Jacobson and Art Camacho behind it. However, there seems to have been a conscious effort to do something totally different and not repeat themselves. They succeeded in that, and it is a nice novelty to see Don in a different kind of role: a dark, horror-tinged storyline instead of a sunny, romantic one like Ring of Fire. Two sides of a coin I guess. Maria Ford is always welcome, and Melanie Smith will be instantly recognized by Seinfeld fans as Jerry&apos;s girlfriend in a story arc on that show.\n\nDon doesn&apos;t say anything until 20 minutes into the movie, and his character and dress are very clearly influenced by The Crow (1994) and Brandon Lee. It&apos;s also one of the better Don performances we&apos;ve seen, as his wooden delivery is hidden well by a character that doesn&apos;t talk much anyway. As this is a Corman production, and he is known for &quot;borrowing&quot; ideas popular at that time, the film also borrows the flamenco music of Desperado (1995) and some ideas from From Dusk Til Dawn (1996). Interestingly it predates Blade (1998) in the fact that it has Vampire POV and Ford&apos;s character is similar to Traci Lords&apos;.\n\nAs far as the fights are concerned, it seems to be a mix of gunplay and martial arts, and highlighted by Don&apos;s punishing finishing moves and death blows. A positive for Night Hunter is that it seems to have created its own vampire rules and mythos. For example, vampires may come out during the day, especially if they wear special sunglasses. Vampires shoot guns, and there is a gunshot-cure serum. Notably, you can only kill them by breaking their neck. So that sets the stage for some violent moves. But there is a major downside...\n\nYou&apos;ve heard of &quot;shaky cam&quot; but during the fight scenes, they seem to have initiated something we called &quot;earthquake cam&quot;. The screen violently shakes, so much so you begin to feel ill. The attempt to be stylish is somewhat appreciated, but you can&apos;t sicken your audience by sticking the camera in one of those paint-shaking machines at the hardware store and not expect a reaction. If this was done to cover up the moves of the actors, there&apos;s no need for that as Don&apos;s moves are excellent. They really should have reined in the earthquake cam. And sometimes they added a strobe light on top of it! For a Don The Dragon movie with more of a professional sheen, and featuring Don in an unorthodox role, by all means try Night Hunter...but beware the earthquake cam.\n\nFor more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",

      "reviewBody": "This excellent film, which has yet to see a DVD release, is so far the best documentary about the evolution of the Rolling Stones. This piece focuses more on the history of the band; not only its musical development, but the more sensational episodes in the personal lives of its members. The story of the Stones in their early days, before they settled down to become elder statesmen, is very much the story of the 60s. Like the Beatles, the Stones became popular before the hippies entered the scene, but in many ways anticipated them and absorbed those trends.\n\nThis 1989 release obviously contains no new information about the Stones&apos; later years, but you&apos;re not really missing anything. The Stones have continued to produce good music, but they&apos;ve become professionals who no longer make headlines for &quot;bad-boy behavior.&quot; It&apos;s a very professional, brilliantly edited piece, and I highly recommend it to any Stones fan. Unfortunately you&apos;ll have to look for a tape or laserdisc on ebay, as the Stones seemingly have no interest in releasing video product of any kind. There are several concert discs which are allowed to go out of print almost immediately, and the last two have been Best Buy exclusives, alienating many retailers and fans.\n\nIf you can find it, this is the one to see.",

It&apos;s all phobia, neurosis and hysterics, so its kinda like watching a train wreck. \n\nThe main difference between patients and staff is that the patients seem more self aware, often knowing just what their problems are, in contrast to the staff who flounder in self ignorance while totally unaware of their own internal issues. Overall the film lacks much depth, maybe the depth was lost in the editing process, so that we are left with...well...mostly just drapes (at least four different sets of drapes by my count, if you include the originals that are to be replaced). Maybe the writers of this story had a drapery fetish? Strange, but you never know!\n\nLillian Gish and Gloria Grahame steal the movie and their performances are worth your viewing time. The whole movie is a guilty pleasure, as neither inmates nor staff seem to be in charge of this asylum. Its fun to watch as the wheels come off and the &quot;Institute for Neurosis&quot; descends into 1950&apos;s campy chaos.",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Whaley plays Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley), a thoroughly annoying smart-mouthed wise-ass waste-of-space with a dead end job as a night janitor in a supermarket. Jennifer Connelly plays Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), a poor little rich girl desperate to get away from her millionaire daddy (who beats her). When Josie chickens out of shoplifting at the last minute, she is locked in the shop for the night and meets Jim (as he roller-skates down an aisle in his boxers and a wedding veil!). Together they do a bit of collective soul-searching, swap sob stories and decide to run away together. However, their plans are interrupted somewhat when a couple of gun wielding thieves break into the store...\n\nDespite being written by top teen-movie maker John Hughes and featuring a pretty decent cast (John Candy has a cameo and the two leads are both capable actors), Career Opportunities (AKA One Wild Night), is a rather weak comedy with irritating characters and very few laughs.\n\nI, like most males who have reviewed this movie on IMDb, do agree, however, that it is worth viewing if you are a fan of Jennifer Connelly and her very impressive curves. The delectable JC looks stunning in a tight white vest and standout scenes include her rollerskating through the shop, and rocking slowly back and forth on a supermarket horse ride (a moment guaranteed to raise the blood pressure of all heterosexual men).\n\nBut of course, Ms. Connelly looking damn fine doesn&apos;t make this a great piece of film-making (just great eye-candy), and ultimately this is a rather desperate &apos;comedy&apos; that comes nowhere near to the matching the quality of Hughes&apos; 80s output.",

This could have served as the prototype for the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films or &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;.\n\nWar correspondent Gable is not beyond inventing a scoop if none is readily available. Myrna Loy, playing a sort of Amelia Earhart role, is duped by a rival news organization into a ploy to beat Gable at his own game. How the action moves from China to New York to a burning ship off the east coast to South America is....too complicated to describe in a short review. This may not be the best Gable film or the most convincing role ever played by Myrna Loy (although it&apos;s quite similar to her &quot;Thin Man&quot; roles), but it is highly entertaining. Both the filming and the story may be a little simplistic for today&apos;s taste and is certainly a far fetched plot but it&apos;s a good rip-roaring yarn nevertheless. I&apos;ll downgrade it to a 9 out of 10 only because the transfer that I saw wasn&apos;t up to the highest standards.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the reasons that Commissar was initially banned in the Soviet Union was the use of religious imagery in the film. One example of this is shortly after Vavilova, the Commissar, has her baby. She walks by a graveyard, and the Russian Orthodox crosses are prominently featured in the shot. This can be interpreted to mean that Vavilova was forced to carry the baby, which she initially considers a burden, in the same manner that Christ had to carry His cross. It could also symbolize the idea of a life cycle, where Vavilova just had a child and is then seen at the cemetery, where she is surrounded by death. Another instance where crosses appear in the film was when Vavilova, Yefim (the father of the Jewish family she is forced to stay with), and his family were boarding up the windows and doors to prepare for the White Army soldiers that were coming. In one shot, Yefim is nailing a beam across a window, perpendicular to another board which clearly makes the shape of a cross.\n\nThe other major example of religion that can be found in the film is when Vavilova travels to the priest, and then to where the synagogue had been. She does this in order to have her baby baptized, or recognized in the Jewish religion. This would not have sat well with Soviet censors, seeing a strong female Commissar traveling in search of someone to baptize her child. I found this scene particularly moving because it seemed that Vavilova simply asked the priest for directions, and would rather have had her baby brought up to be Jewish. This shows the positive impact that Yefim and his family had on Vavilova during her stay."

      "name": "Very Dark, Very Entertaining Comedy",
      "reviewBody": "This little dark comedy is made a real treat by the professional, understated acting by all of its stars and direction that has produced pure entertainment rather than a silly mess.\n\nThe plot of the film couldn&apos;t be any more far-fetched. Frank Falenczyk, a hit man for a low-level crime family in Albany, New York, is not performing well because he has an alcohol problem. He is sent to kill the boss of a crime group who is muscling in on the territory. Instead of doing his job, he passes out from drink in his car while waiting. What follows is probably the weirdest family intervention scene ever filmed in which Frank&apos;s boss and other members of the crime family tell him that he must go to San Francisco to seek rehabilitation.\n\nFrank is packed off to San Francisco, but it is clear his heart is not into the rehabilitation idea for his first two purchases are a gun and a bottle of vodka. He goes to an AA meeting and views the whole process with disdain. After leaving the meeting early, he is approached by Dave the realtor who arranged for Frank&apos;s apartment and a job as an undertaker&apos;s assistant. Dave has some sort of connection with Albany, and Frank is told in no uncertain terms that this is his last chance. Dave assures Frank that he will be reporting regularly to the head of the crime family back East.\n\nWith no other choice, Frank starts going to the meetings where he meets Tom. Tom is a gay toll booth attendant at the Golden Gate Bridge who is wise to the ways of AA. One of the elements that impressed me about the script of this film is how Tom&apos;s character is handled. Yes, he is gay, but there is no gay angst associated with his character, and there no Gay Tom subplot. Tom is just a normal guy who just happens to be gay - a refreshing change to the way most gay characters are dealt with in films.\n\nLaurel shows up at the funeral parlor with a pair of bowling shoes for her dead stepfather, and Frank is immediately attracted as it is clear that she is no shrinking violet when it comes to the harsher realities of life. They begin dating.\n\nPutting all of these elements together could have easily produced an over-the-top mess of absurdity, but You Kill Me is not. Instead - as alluded to regarding the character of Tom - it is a perfect blend of excellent acting and subtle direction that produces unadulterated entertainment.\n\nThe cast is headed by Ben Kingsley playing Frank, and Kingsley gives us a man we can believe can murder in cold blood, yet possess the weaknesses of a man addicted to alcohol and smitten by a sassy woman.\n\nAs for that sassy woman, Téa Leoni is perfect in the part. Her voice and facial expressions convey worlds of irony mixed with amazement when it comes to her character&apos;s relationship with a killer.\n\nLuke Wilson gives a wonderfully understated performance as Tom. Dave is played to his quirky best by Bill Pullman, and the respective leaders of the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; crime families are given credible umph by Philip Baker Hall and Dennis Farina.\n\nAdd numerous other distinctive character types revolving around these main characters and tons of incredibly witty lines delivered by Frank and his friends, and you have an extremely entertaining - although very dark - comedy.",

      "name": "Another huge success from that genius Val Lewton!",
      "reviewBody": "After their success in 1942 with the fabulous &apos;Cat People&apos;, the star team of producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur would team up twice the year later. First for the compelling and brilliant &apos;I Walked With a Zombie&apos;, and second for this film; The Leopard Man. For the movie, the two filmmakers re-cast the star of their first success, the big black leopard, in this movie, who once again plays a big black leopard. The screenplay this time round makes far better use of the animal at the centre of the film, which allows the impressive creature to make a much bigger impression on the movie, and it also gives the film a unique edge over other horror movies, as there aren&apos;t a great deal that can build around a leopard. In fact, one thing that struck me about this movie was it&apos;s similarity to the 1980&apos;s remake of Cat People, and I wonder just how much influence that film took from this production. Anyway, the story here is deliriously simple and it follows a leopard that has escaped from a nightclub. After a few deaths, the cat is blamed...but is there more to this scenario than meets the eye?\n\nJust like Val Lewton&apos;s earlier and later productions, The Leopard Man is notable for it&apos;s breathtaking atmosphere, which is once again up there with the greatest ever seen in cinema. The use of shadows and lighting is impressive, and when you combine this with Jacques Tourneur&apos;s incredible ability to stage a scene amidst this atmosphere; you&apos;ve got a recipe for a truly great horror movie. This movie isn&apos;t as full of great scenes as Cat People was, but there is still some really good stuff on display, including my favourite scene which sees someone mauled behind a closed door. I&apos;m not a big subscriber to the idea of &apos;less is more&apos;, but the scene I just mentioned goes to show just how well it can work if utilised properly. If the film had directly shown the killing, it would have uprooted the atmosphere and the terror of the movie on the whole wouldn&apos;t have been as astute. As it happens, The Leopard Man has got it spot on. But then again, would you expect anything less from a Val Lewton production?",

Lamberto Bava obviously didn&apos;t inherit his fathers talent for grand filmmaking, but at least he had the sense to make his stupid little movies fun and fast paced. Monster Shark is no exception, plus it&apos;s a feast for lovers of rubber monsters and italian homoerotism.",

Unlike the others of the gore genre this one isn&apos;t too over the top it its gross outs. There is actually a story, there are funny parts, no overwhelming gore and the lead is pretty. There isn&apos;t the &quot;this is just sick and disgusting&quot; feeling. Don&apos;t expect award winning acting. But if you don&apos;t mind watching a B movie with gore and bad special effects.

      "reviewBody": "On a chaotic summer day among the poor souls in a horrific Polish concentration camp, 1944, young inmate Tomasz (Mateusz Damiecki) is desperate. German jew Hannah (Alice Dywer) is almost certainly meant for death at the hands of the Nazis running the facility. The two have fallen hopelessly in love, and he knows he must get her out and far, far away before it&apos;s too late. In an impossibly courageous effort and a scene that will pummel your nerves, he uses a stolen SS officer&apos;s uniform, scoops her up from the workhouse wing and quietly leads her right out the front gate. The two disappear into the neighboring Polish woodland in what is one of the only escapes from a nazi concentration camp ever documented. It&apos;s a bold, thrilling, stirring way to start the film, whether or not you know of its origins in actual history. That kind of escape from a place so hellish is a collective sigh of relief from both audience and characters, and it&apos;s one nail biter of an emotional ring of fire we all are forced to jump through. But we know this isn&apos;t the end, the resolute happiness we so wish for these two, because the film has only just started. In the confusion near the end of the war, the two of them are separated, and move forward in life each believing the other to be dead. This is all interspersed with visions of Hannah&apos;s life far in the future of 1976, now married, in her 50&apos;s and played by the sensational Dagmar Menzel. In a dry cleaner shop one day she happens to see a talk show on European television, where a man recounts his daring rescue and escape from Auschwitz. The details are eerily similar, and Hannah&apos;s mind races. Could this be Tomasz? Could he be alive after all these years and most importantly, should she go to him despite the gulf of time that signifies their prolonged separation? The film tugs at your heartstrings in so many different ways and moments, effectively hanging your tear ducts out to dry. No one can say no to a good wartime romance, because the formula is just too workable. Amidst all that confusion, terror and violence it is essential to find some sort of good with which to combat the dark, and what better way than the strongest force of all, love? Dywer and Damiecki are beyond convincing in their roles, so clearly blessed and burdened with that go for broke, die for one another type passion that we all look for and seldom find. American actor David Rasche plays Hannah&apos;s husband in New York, clearly torn up by the tumultuous past rearing it&apos;s head in their lives, but willing to empathize with the woman he loves and strive to do what&apos;s best in this difficult situation. Menzel is conflicted, hurt, hopeful and utterly, convincingly reactive in a role that&apos;s just not an easy one to pull off. Director Anna Justice uses majesterial skill to get the flow of story just right from scene to scene. Narratives which skip backwards and forwards in time can often feel jagged and unfounded in cohesion, but this one ebbs and flows from moment to moment without a single beat skipped or turn of plot out of place. I did some research on the true life tale this is based on, and for the most part they have stuck to fact to bring us as story that&apos;s almost unbelievable, and deeply emotional. Remembrance is a keeper.",

Will their kids be able to understand sex on a safe way? And by the way: what is &quot;understanding sex safely&quot;? Did their career had something to do with their childhood?

The rest of the cast aren&apos;t all that remarkable, even if there are a load of faces I recognise from other things. If I had to choose the most noteworthy, they would be Cesar Romero (Arno) &amp; William Schallert (Quigley).\n\nThe plot is enjoyable, it&apos;s just as bonkers as you&apos;d expect given it&apos;s in a similar vein to films like 1961&apos;s &apos;The Absent-Minded Professor&apos;. I&apos;d say it&apos;s better executed than that Flubber premise. There&apos;s also a cool chase sequence in this, too.\n\nI&apos;m curious to see where the sequels head.",

      "reviewBody": "Watching &quot;True Identity,&quot; I was somehow reminded of an old &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Eddie Murphy skit where he disguised himself as a white man, then walked around New York City in makeup, realizing that when no black people are around, white people like to get funky.\n\nAt first I thought it was just a basic idea that bore resemblance, until two gags used in Murphy&apos;s skit were used in the film, and I started to wonder how they had ever gotten away with ripping off his materal. Then I realized that the writer of the film, Andy Breckman, used to write for &quot;SNL,&quot; and that the film was an unofficial spin-off of Murphy&apos;s skit.\n\nThe problem with &quot;SNL&quot; spin-offs is that they take a successful five-minute paper-thin gag and stretch it out to full length. Mary Katherine Gallagher was never very funny, but her skits were watchable; whoever decided to put her oddball, unlikable character into a movie was nuts.\n\nLuckily, even though it is far from being a great motion picture, &quot;True Identity&quot; has its fair share of good moments, which include British comedian Lenny Henry getting to dress up as a white guy and pose as an Italian-American mobster hit-man, then posing as James Brown&apos;s brother. (One of Murphy&apos;s trademark characters on &quot;SNL&quot; was his impersonation of James Brown in &quot;James Brown&apos;s Hot Tub.&quot;)\n\nMiles Pope is an aspiring actor living in the big city with hopes of becoming the lead in &quot;Othello.&quot; When he boards a plane, he finds himself seated next to a strange man named Leland Carver. When the plane starts to plummet, Carver (played by Frank Langella) admits that he used to be a criminal, who was believed to have died in an explosion, but in reality survived, had facial alterations, and &quot;spent thousands setting up a new identity.&quot; Of course, the plane then regains itself, leaving Miles with the knowledge that he will probably be chased by the gangster&apos;s hit men. So his only option is to disguise himself as a white man.\n\nThis is essentially a very weak setup, with a truly ridiculous and contrived plot (like a mobster would admit his real persona for no reason whatsoever). But the movie does have a fair amount of fun, and a few good belly laughs, including the opening scene. &quot;You need to get to your roots,&quot; a director of a play tells Miles. &quot;Act more black.&quot; &quot;But black people don&apos;t act like this anymore!&quot; Miles says. The director doesn&apos;t care, so Miles tries to portray a stereotypical black man. The result is very funny.\n\nThe film, as a whole, is completely harmless and serves its purpose. It&apos;s entertaining, with a silly plot but a good amount of funny scenes. Henry is able to show off how good he is at comedy while we are entertained. And for the record, his &quot;white man makeup&quot; was much more convincing than Murphy&apos;s.",

      "reviewBody": "This was the first time we actually saw the teenage love Shakespeare intended. Years and years before Leonardo Di Caprio and Clare Danes, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Houssey gave life to the tragic story told in this ancestral tale, revamping it without betraying it, making it accessible to a 60s audience without updating it. Leonard and Olivia were so beautiful that Shakespeare became trendy again and I don&apos;t mean any disrespect by it, I&apos;m simply stating a fact. The real, stunning, dusty locations, the costumes, the faces, the music made the whole thing a totally new Shakespearen experience. Remember than the biggest screen adaptation of this play had been with the forty something Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer in those roles. Here everything reeked of youth underlining the tragedy in the most cinematic way. Another important point is to confirm that in 2007 the film still feels young and fresh. Recommended",

Big Miracle is a wholesome, educational and entertaining movie that I happily recommend to anyone struggling like we often to to find a movie suitable for the under 15 crowd, that adults will also enjoy.\n\nBig Miracle is loosely based on a true story and utilizes TV news clips from the Reagan era that we felt made the film very realistic. Ancient traditions, multi-generational challenges, morality, ethics, friendship, love and social responsibility are weaved into a story set in beautiful Alaska that made us laugh, cry and cheer along with the characters - it was a fun adventure into a world we didn&apos;t know much about.",

The plot recalls O&apos;Neill&apos;s Desire Under the Elms (filmed in 1958) and Sidney Howard&apos;s They Knew What They Wanted (filmed in 1940 with Charles Laughton and musicalized by Frank Loesser in The Most Happy fellow in 1956)--older man, mail order bride, affair between wife and younger man.\n\nVery slow in the 1950s style but powerfully acted. Not the sort of film you&apos;d expect from Cukor. Interesting facet to his career.\n\nAlso interesting to compare this film and Secret of San Vittorio which re-united Magnani and Quinn after 12 years--older and maybe toned down just a notch, with the Irish/Mexican Quinn again playing an Italian.",

It tells about politicians in Italy in the early &apos;90s, about corruption that was the rule in those years. The characters portrayed by Nanni Moretti is the perfect example of this kind of politician. After that came - in the real life - the trials in Milano, which tore up an entire way of make politics, corruption seemed to be won.. but only for a while. After 15 years many things are back to what they used to be, politician are in Italy as corrupted as they once were (perhaps they never ceased to be), but with different names and different flags and that&apos;s the saddest thing.",

      "reviewBody": "What is the Jewish reality? How is it unreal, different than normal, and what does it mean for the people? This is at the center of this three- hour documentary on the state of Israel by the filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, whose biggest call to fame is apparently the later Shoah. He travels the country with his camera hoping more to amass rich and diverse contrasts than any easy set of answers. The film, made just before the Yom Kippur war, so when elation over the Six-Days was still running high, is loosely a series of interviews, with Lanzmann probing from all angles, visiting the rich and poor, prisons, construction sites, kibbutz.\n\nSo what does the accordionist who was a member of the Communist Youth in 1933 Berlin have in common with intellectual German Jews, bankers and lawyers? Marxist kibbutz youth with the blue-collar dock workers of Haifa?\n\nHow do the busload of complacent American Jews visiting from Boston partake of the same identity, the same reality as some of the first settlers of the Negev who made the desert bloom, then in their 70&apos;s?\n\nA few notes. You&apos;ll decide whether Lanzmann&apos;s decision to not give voice to Palestinians is omission or statement, especially resonant now that you know of Israeli efforts to isolate Palestinians behind walls. However, put that aside and this is an illuminating work on Israeli soul. You may note as connecting tissue the fact that all the people interviewed feel Jewish. The direct link of how deeply this is felt to how deeply it is opposed in the area and elsewhere. \n\nAnd yet, this instinctively felt &apos;Jewishness&apos; emerges as not a single thing. Usually lost in polarizing talks of the Israeli-Arab conflict, Israelis are as diverse as their neighbors, even more so at the time. Religion, the Holocaust, the army, all three are shown to be strong social adhesives of identity—Lanzmann would make separate films on the last two.\n\nWhy this hits deep is that you don&apos;t have political and historical &apos;experts&apos; spouting analysis, this fluidity of identity is laid bare as part of actual life, in the stories of people.\n\nI am fascinated by the broader implications of the question of how we structure reality and self. Is it this or not this? Is there mechanism? I have been charting this through films, our best tool for structuring reality.\n\nMy favorite bit here which I think explains a broader cycle is the following: an airplane is shown to dock in Tel Aviv, and out comes a fresh batch of Jewish immigrants to bolster the still young nation-state, these ones from Russia, from Georgia and Lithuania, some of whom don&apos;t even speak the language and whose only connection to their new home is that they identify as Jews. It is startling to see the face of a steppe- hardened old Russian, it&apos;s so evident he is from another faraway world.\n\nJews in Russia, but suddenly Russians in Israel.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Jews had a tenuous presence in Palestine up until the late 19th century, one of many tribal minorities. They had a rich history of dislocation, from Judea to Spain and Russia and so on. We can actually see, in the film, how diverse they grew to be in exile, contrast the Boston Jews with the Russians, the Germans with the Arab Jews. I know of no other film that offers this profound view of a people.\n\nThe connecting tissue is the same as what compelled the return; tied to persecution, it was the story of a promised land, a place most knew as only part of the story of who they are. The journeys of those early pioneers are in a way mirrored in some of the stories of later settlers recounted here. So how revealing when you find out that Zionist planners lied and manipulated to entice settlers?\n\nSo, fluid self. A fictional story as anchor mapping reality to come.\n\nIts power? It made the desert bloom. When the Jews started coming back, there was no Tel Aviv waiting for them, it was all built from scratch on sand dunes. There was, in fact, a whole slate of part-travelogue, part-advertisement films made in early 1930&apos;s Palestine to encourage settlement there, shown abroad, which I hope to write about in future posts."

      "reviewBody": "Private investigator Philip Marlowe is approached by a friend, Terry Lennox, who is in a bit of a jam. Marlowe helps him get to Mexico but the next day his friend&apos;s wife turns up dead. The police hold Marlowe but then release him once Terry Lennox is found dead in Mexico - suicide. To the cops it is an open-and-shut case of murder-suicide but Marlowe doesn&apos;t believe that to be the case. Marlowe then is hired by the wife of wealthy author Roger Wade to find her husband. The Wades were neighbours of the Lennoxes. A powerful mob boss also leans on him to find the large sum of money Terry Lennox was transporting for him. Could all these events be connected? \n\nRobert Altman directs a movie based on a Raymond Chandler novel, and it&apos;s a mixed bag. \n\nStarts off very well with some humorous scenes and dialogue and a fair amount of intrigue. The middle-to-end sections lack focus, however, and, while it is never dull, the movie feels like it is drifting to a lacklustre conclusion. The intrigue just seems to get sucked out of the movie in that segment. In addition, the theme song gets played in just about every situation and in various forms - it gets very irritating, very quickly.\n\nEnds well though, with a good twist and a powerful conclusion.\n\nA new take on Philip Marlowe from Elliott Gould - he is hardly Humphrey Bogart and he&apos;s not trying to be. Altman&apos;s Philip Marlowe is the dishevelled, anti-social chain-smoking anti-hero rather than the suave, confident hero that Bogart portrayed. For the most part, it works, though at times I wished for the coolness and wise-cracks of Bogie. \n\nSupporting cast are fine. Sterling Hayden is great as the larger-than-life, Ernest Hemingway/John Huston-esque Roger Wade. \n\nNot the Philip Marlowe of the Bogart movies, but it&apos;ll do.",

There is good company acting and everybody obviously enjoyed doing this film. Heinz Erhardt has the opportunity to recite a number of his silly poems. Hannelore Elsner is charming as Susan.\n\nWell-written script; direction by Staudte is good craftsmanship.

      "reviewBody": "Jess Franco&apos;s &quot;Il Trono di fuoco&quot; aka. &quot;The Bloody Judge&quot; of 1970 is one of a bunch of early 70s exploitation flicks inspired by the success of Michael Reeves&apos; 1968 masterpiece &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; (starring the great Vincent Price). People familiar with Jess Franco&apos;s cinema might expect an immensely sleazy and gruesome film that mainly takes place in torture chambers, but the film is actually tame for what one might expect. Even though there are a bunch of very brutal scenes, the level of sleaze and violence is quite low for a Jess Franco film, and the film is not even nearly as nasty as other popular &apos;Hexploitation&apos; films of the time, such as the ultra-gruesome &quot;Mark Of The Devil&quot; from the same year. Equally surprising is the budget that was obviously quite high for Jess Franco standards, as realistic costumes and nice settings are provided.\n\nHorror icon Christopher Lee, who worked with Jess Franco on several occasions, plays Lord George Jeffreys, the infamous and merciless judge and Lord Chancellor in England torn by strife between the reigning King James II and William of Orange. Convincend of doing what&apos;s necessary, the cruel judge mercilessly persecutes &apos;traitors&apos;, who sympathize with the King&apos;s opponent William of Orange, as well as &apos;witches&apos;, who are accused of being in league with the devil...\n\nChristopher Lee is, as always, great in his role as the merciless judge (who is based on the infamous real-life &apos;hanging-judge&apos; George 1st baron Jeffreys). Beautiful Maria Rohm, who starred in many Franco-highlights, most memorably in &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot;, plays the female lead here, and she fits in her role very well. Jess Franco-fans will also recognize another regular in his films, Howard Vernon, who plays the executioner. Another great enrichment to the film is the great score by Bruno Nicolai. Jess Franco, one of the most prolific directors ever, has directed a bunch of absolutely awesome films, as well as total stinkers. &quot;The Bloody Judge&quot; is definitely one of his better films (even though, in my opinion, not one of his masterpieces), and a more than decent historical horror film. Highly recommended!",

      "reviewBody": "Ed Fury already had two &quot;Ursus&quot; films under his peplum and still had one more to go when he tossed off this entry in the sword-and-sandal field which moved the action to the Spanish-Moorish world of the late 1500s. Despite the change in sets and costumes, the story is the usual mishmash of kidnapped princesses, evil tyrants, feats of strength, duplicitous noblemen, etc. It&apos;s passably diverting for fans of this genre but no one really seems to have his heart in the proceedings.\n\nFury doesn&apos;t make his appearance until the second reel and it takes him a bit longer to get his shirt off. After that, he&apos;s frequently bare-chested. There&apos;s no background or depth to his character which gives him a vaguely &quot;cartoony&quot; quality but, as one might expect, he&apos;s subjected to a dose of beefcake-bondage. In one scene he&apos;s chained to the wall of a dungeon and threatened with two sharpened points about to be rammed into his eyes. In a later scene he has to fight off six hulking warriors. The last of these warriors gives Fury seventeen lashes with a whip as Fury writhes on the ground but the whip is obviously just a piece of rope and so this torment has little impact. Finally Fury has to lift back into place a fallen stone obelisk. This isn&apos;t very plausible, even for a &quot;Maciste,&quot; but it is a unique moment in films.\n\nFury performs with his usual off-hand charm but he seems out-of-place, somewhat uncomfortable, and occasionally bored. For those trying to follow the overly-tangled story, &quot;Ramiro&quot; is the Spanish plotter who&apos;s trying to take over the Dukedom of Malaga and &quot;Zuleima&quot; is the beautiful Arab girl who helps Maciste at a key moment.\n\nThis review is based on, alas, a black-and-white VHS tape which seemed to be missing bits and pieces of footage.",

      "reviewBody": "Beautifully mounted recreation of 19th century New York, which is not surprising since this was RKO&apos;s golden age of set design and art direction. Those wall encased aquariums that line the main hall are shrewdly suggestive that anything might happen in such an exotic old mansion. Note too, the constant presence of snow on the sidewalks, a realistic and atmospheric touch unusual because of the expense.\n\nThe opening scenes foreshadow dangers to come-- the locomotive plowing through flooded tracks, the odd &quot;birdlike&quot; passenger who intrudes with her strange story. All of this had me thinking the movie would be special. Indeed, the first half is intriguing as the doctor (Brent) delves further into the mysterious death of the birdlike woman. However, the second half flattens out into a rather static drawingroom drama that fails to generate the kind of edge-of-the-seat climax that&apos;s needed.\n\nGeorge Brent was never a charismatic leading man, bland at best. Here, however, he blends right in as the stolidly responsible doctor who can be believed. The trouble is that the script follows him around for almost the entire time, and since he&apos;s seldom privy to events with the boy, we don&apos;t get much sense of the menace surrounding the boy that should drive the suspense, but doesn&apos;t. La Marr, of course, looks exquisite as the script requires; nonetheless, her skills as a besieged wife are considerably less than those of Ingrid Bergmann in the remarkably similar Gaslight (1944). Then too, Paul Lukas lacks the kind of conniving charm that the part calls for, making the showdown less a revelation of his true character, than a simple extension.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie has the great Albert Decker as a maverick sculptor who breathes real life into the proceedings, along with a terrific explosion and fire that&apos;s a real grabber. However, I&apos;m still puzzling over that awkward epilogue involving the cop at movie&apos;s end. Was that to satisfy Code requirements that nothing gets past the police since there is an element of deception that would otherwise be left hanging. Anyway, whatever the movie&apos;s shortcomings, it remains unerringly pictorial throughout, a tribute to the artistic eye of director Jacques Tourneur and the RKO art department."

      "reviewBody": "This reboot of the Godzilla franchise is not outstanding, but it&apos;s solid enough. The Cold War fears of nuclear proliferation are played out by the Americans and Soviets both advocating the use of nuclear weapons to destroy Godzilla and promising that it would be &quot;contained to a small area,&quot; while the Japanese prime minister expresses grave concerns about that, and his forces focus on more controlled, scientific methods. Privately, they express worry that the superpowers are only offering to do it because they want to test and practice with their nuclear arsenal, and wonder if they would use them on their own soil, which were nice bits of cynicism. Both sides also have nuclear space weapons, the control of which becomes as big a threat as Godzilla itself. The only thing I rolled my eyes over was how poor the actor who played the American envoy was, though mercifully it&apos;s a small part.\n\nAs for Godzilla&apos;s foot-stomping, tail-swinging, atomic energy-breathing mayhem, the special effects are hit and miss even accounting for the film being 40 years old, but there are some cool moments, like when he lifts up a train and looks inside. Otherwise it&apos;s as if he&apos;s walking through Tokyo like a drunken sailor, wreaking havoc. I always think he should be tilted forward, like modern representations of theropods, but this is of course the original kaiju. The film has him representing nuclear weaponry, forever loose in the world after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, immortal and always a threat to destroy blindly, which certainly resonates, as does the view one character expresses that the monsters are an indication of imbalance in the world and a sign of the &quot;end times for humanity.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Well, the 2019 animated movie &quot;Big Trip&quot; was watchable and actually turned out to be an adequately entertaining animated movie. It wasn&apos;t, however, a particularly outstanding or memorable one though.\n\nThe storyline told in &quot;Big Trip&quot; was good enough, but it was just lacking that certain comedy element that many other animated movies have, you know, the animated movies that actually bring about laughs and good entertainment. So without that particular ingredient, &quot;Big Trip&quot; just didn&apos;t stand out among other animated movies also released in 2019.\n\nI sat down to watch &quot;Big Trip&quot; with my 10 year old son, and he enjoyed it well enough. So whereas other animated movies appeal to both adults and children alike, &quot;Big Trip&quot; was more aimed at the younger audience.\n\nThe characters in the story were interesting enough, some more than others of course, as it is in every movie. Both my and I were liking the wolf, Janus, the most of all the characters in the story.\n\nThe art style in the animated movie was interesting and good enough, however it just wasn&apos;t outstanding. Now, mind you, I am not saying that it was in any way not good or anything, but it was just not having that special appeal to it that you see in some other animated movies.\n\nIf you happen to have the chance to sit down and watch &quot;Big Trip&quot;, do so, but you shouldn&apos;t rush out to look for it, as it just wasn&apos;t that entertaining. My rating of the 2019 animated movie &quot;Big Trip&quot; lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",

I haven&apos;t watched the Danish version, but yes, this German remake also carries unmistakable nods to Ringu, not only regarding the ghost, but even more so in the setting of its climax. Actually, restless female ghost motif is not obviously unique to Ringu, but the setting of the climax is clearly derived from Ringu. Having acknowledged this, 205 - Zimmer der Angst is nevertheless a pretty well-made and effective horror outing which cannot be reduced to being a Ringu rip-off. The first two-thirds of the movie does not have much chills but is very engaging as we follow the trials and tribunals of the female lead (played very successfully by a young actress). The last third carries a few quite scary scenes. Overall, thumbs up for this rare German effort at horror. By the way, the movie actually carries some nods to Suspiria as well as Ringu.",

The color in this film looks a lot better than most people of the day describes it as. And I think the guy who said the color looked like &quot;boiled salmon dipped in mayonese&quot; has had a little too much mayonese. Altogether, I highly recommend this film for anyone who can&apos;t seem to find a good movie to watch, because this is the one!"

Rather, this plays like a late-cycle Edgar Wallace krimi with the Scotland Yard detective a secret agent and a murderer who happens to have stolen a top secret invention.  The circus milieu (the Palladium in Vienna) is quite tedious but other Vienna locations are nice to look at like the empty amusement park where the villain hides out.\n\nPierre Brice is Philippe Taylor (changed from `Tissot&apos; for the English dub apparently) an agent on the trail of the device.  Brice was a looker who made a lot of westerns in the sixties and he was in the anthology Spy Against the World (66) but most may recognize him from Mill of the Stone Women (60).  He&apos;s very bland here but that suits the rest of the film.\n\nThe score by Charly Niessen (arrangements by Gert Wilden), is okay but is occasionally inappropriate for the action on the screen.  Director Alfred Weidenmann can&apos;t do much with this material either; the script is just plain weak.  I had high hopes for this one but you can skip it knowing you haven&apos;t missed a darn thing."

      "reviewBody": "According to its opening credits, &apos;The Argyle Case&apos; is based on a stage play ... but then, immediately after the main credits, a title card appears bearing a message with the signature of William J Burns, the deputy attorney-general who founded the FBI. According to this title card, &apos;The Argyle Case&apos; is based on an actual murder case in the FBI&apos;s files. I&apos;m inclined to believe the stage-play version, not the FBI version. This story is very stagey, and I couldn&apos;t believe it was based on a real murder case, FBI or otherwise ... especially as the FBI didn&apos;t exist yet when the play was originally written. Still, it&apos;s difficult to believe that the filmmakers would appropriate FBI boss Burns&apos;s name without his permission. So I believe that the Burns testimonial is authentic, which is not to say that it&apos;s accurate.\n\nFrom this point, the movie starts promisingly. In the opening sequence, wealthy John Argyle (briefly played by Lew Harvey) is murdered. The murder sequence is imaginatively staged: we see and hear the crime occurring, yet the identity of the murderer is withheld from us in a plausible manner, using a subjective camera set-up that was later echoed (copied?) in the British film &apos;Green for Danger&apos;.\n\nAfter this intriguing start, the movie gets weirder and less plausible. Thomas Meighan gives a stolid performance as homicide investigator Alex Kayton. His assistants are fat Joe and plodding Sam. Whenever he gives them an order, they reply &apos;O.K., A.K.&apos; This is the funniest gag in the movie, and a bit cheeky with it. The letters &apos;A.K.&apos; are Kayton&apos;s initials, but they&apos;re also the abbreviation for a Yiddish epithet, &apos;alter kocker&apos;. George S Kaufman ripped off this gag for his musical &apos;Of Thee I Sing&apos;, with the Supreme Court judges intoning &apos;We&apos;re the A.K.s who give the O.K.s&apos;.\n\nJohn Argyle&apos;s will and testament leave all his money to young Mary Morgan, played by the beautiful Lila Lee. This doesn&apos;t sit well with Argyle&apos;s son Bruce, played ineptly by John Darrow. Bert Roach is unpleasant, as usual. Also on hand is ZaSu Pitts as one of the suspects. This actress usually gets very wearisome very quickly, with her annoying fluttery gestures and quivery speech. Here, ZaSu manages to out-zasoo herself by talking a blue streak (or maybe an argyle streak) with that annoying voice of hers. Gladys Brockwell, an attractive woman who usually played harridans, is seen to good advantage here. Sadly, Brockwell died (from injuries in a road accident) at about the time this film was released. She could have had a very successful career in early talkies; her voice records well here, and she shows a firm technique for talking pictures.\n\nSPOILER COMING. Of course, Alex Kayton solves the murder: if you&apos;re familiar with these actors from roles in other films, the cast list gives you a good idea of whodunnit. Mary Morgan inherits John Argyle&apos;s millions ... and then Kayton announces that he plans to marry her, *despite* her wealth. Hoo boy. If this movie could keep up the moody atmosphere of that opening scene, it would be a classic. As it stands, I&apos;ll rate it 7 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "If you are like me and you love the inbetweeners television show, then the movie will have been much anticipated. I am pleased to report that the movie is not a disappointment. Will, Simon, Jay and Neil are all together as the group head out to Malia for a lads holiday after leaving school. It is meant to be the holiday of a life time, but in classic inbetweeners style not everything goes to plan.\n\nThe film is meant to be a fair well to the guys after three very successful TV series and the lads go out in style. The opening of the film sees Simon being dumped by Carli, which gives Jay the idea that the group should leave their troubles behind and have a holiday full of drink, girls and many other things. The holiday shows the boys at the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, but in the end having the time of their lives.\n\nThese characters have made me laugh for the past couple of years on television and I was sad to hear that the third series would be the last. However I was pleasantly surprised when I heard about the movie being made. It would be a final send off to four of the funniest faces on TV. The film (just like the show) gives each character their own problems and triumphs as the film goes on and as we expect, some very embarrassing moments. The film is very funny and has numerous laugh out loud moments, but the great thing is the spirit of the film. It has a good heart and a script that gives the characters we care about fitting conclusions.\n\nThe credit has to be given to the writers Ian Morris and Damon Beesley who wrote the show as well. This is more then just a spin off from the show, it is a uplifting tale for the four boys full of plenty of laughs. I hope the film receives praise from the critics as it is more then just the comedy of the year, but in my mind one of the best films of the year.\n\nNever disappointed or bored at any point in the film, the inbetweeners movie is a wonderful tale of coming of age. You will be pushed to find a more entertaining and funny film all year. I loved it!",

Kevin Mitnick, a genius with computers who was a little too inquisitive for the authorities liking, has been the victim of so many abuses that it can make one&apos;s stomach turn. &quot;Takedown&quot; was adapted from a book written by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura who exploited Kevin, a man about whom neither of the authors had any direct knowledge, and pretended to be Mitnick experts when in fact they couldn&apos;t have been more clueless.\n\nMarkoff, a hack journalist who did everything that he could to portray Kevin a danger to society in order to keep writing articles about him, has claimed wild rumors about Mitnick to be fact (rumors such as Kevin hacking into NORAD computers, harassing Christie McNickle, and converting home phones into pay phones) with no regard for the fact that he was demonizing Kevin in the eyes of society and in the eyes of a justice system - a system that would eventually lock Kevin in solitary confinement for 8 months because they were afraid he would use prison phones to launch nuclear missiles if placed in general population. Tsutomu Shimomura is nothing but a smart-ass hacker wanna-be whose main contribution to the book &quot;Takedown&quot; was a list of his skateboarding and eating habits.\n\nIf anyone out there really wants to learn the true Kevin Mitnick story, please view &quot;Freedom Downtime&quot; by Emmanuel Goldstein.

      "reviewBody": "In New York, in a morning close to Christmas, an upper class father and mother go in their BMW to a private school to see the play of their daughter. Then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in Manhattan. In the night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare drugs for distribution. On the Christmas Eve, while buying the Christmas gift for their daughter, the father is kidnapped, and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom. &quot;R Xmas&quot; is a deceptive movie of Abel Ferrara. The lead characters do not have names, are anonymous, and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers; or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than the criminals; or is it a simple apology to crime? Whatever! However, this humanization of criminals is a horrible message, and I really did not like this movie. In Brazil, for example, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the State in poor areas and slums, but this procedure does not make them model citizen. In this movie, we see a loving upper class family in the day, providing drugs as means of living, but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters. In the end, I wished all of them dead. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Gangues do Gueto&quot; (&quot;Gangs of the Ghetto&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This film is of course a dangerous experiment with ingredients like: a court drama, holocaust 40 years after and absolute no action at all. But because of the great performances by the actors, it ends up as a deeply moving experience.\n\nAnd at the very center, Jessica Lange does a tremendous job as the lawyer and daughter of a Hungarian war criminal - or is he? She appears in almost every picture of the film, and I find her very convincing in her emotional ups and downs throughout. She does it with no glamour, but alone her incredible personality.\n\nMost of the other actors does a great job as well, and the only reason for not voting it in top is, that the plot is not too convincing - but it first became obvious some time after I watched the film, simply because of the fine acting.\n\nI voted 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "I went into Burst City not knowing what it was. I hadn&apos;t seen footage or read much about it, and I hadn&apos;t seen any of Sogo Ishii&apos;s other films, to get a sense of the director. But from a glance at some of the director&apos;s filmography, posters and screenshots I may have seen out in the ether, I could tell there was a punk aesthetic in some of his films, that I personally found immensely intriguing, and there&apos;s a few of his films that I know by name and by poster art if nothing else and have long desired to see. I guess the reason I went this long without watching any of his films, was because I couldn&apos;t find any of them in any kind of half-decent quality.\n\nBurst City it turns out, is some kind of insane 1980s Japanese punk rock concept album music video. Like &quot;Tommy&quot;, but with ridiculous teenage Japanese punk songs with lyrics that make no sense, directed by way of a young Shin&apos;ya Tsukamoto. What skeleton of a plot there is, you might sometimes sense occasionally, like an underdeveloped V-cinema Takashi Miike dystopian Mad Max sci-fi script, bobbing just below the surface, drowning under the enormity of the film&apos;s aesthetic. Basically, the story of the film, or the &quot;concept&quot; in the sense of the concept album music video, boils down to being about youth rebelling against &quot;the man&quot;. But when Burst City is at its best is when it blocks out all pretence of a plot and with seeming effortlessness, becomes pure aesthetic perfection.\n\nThe first scene of Burst City, the first song on the album, which has no lyrics and sets the mood for the album to come, would be, from a directorial perspective, a masterfully brilliant opening to any film with a genuine narrative script that might be able to accommodate such an opening. Many of the other scenes in Burst City, too, feel like they could make really heart-pumping moments in a more conventional film. But the fact is that they&apos;re all together in this one nonsensical film, which may make the whole thing feel somewhat hollow in the end - like there&apos;s no substance here - OR it could be seen as freeing the film up from slavish adherence to a narrative that would diminish its aesthetic credibility.\n\nThe best comparison for Burst City would be another 80s cult Japanese musical film that was curated out of obscurity recently, &quot;The Legend of the Stardust Brothers&quot; released on blu-ray by Third Window Films. Another film that&apos;s more a full album music video than a narrative feature film, Legend of the Stardust Brothers, like Burst City, is also an extremely campy strange cultural artifact - or time capsule - of a film. I think the main difference is, where Stardust Brothers&apos; camp is just funny, Burst City&apos;s camp, while undoubtedly funny, is, to be honest, kind of pretty cool at the same time. Kind of satisfying. How liberating it would be to be a ridiculous Japanese punk in the 80s. I&apos;m kind of really really endeared to this aesthetic.\n\nThe Arrow blu-ray release, I have no doubt, presents this film looking true to how it was intended, and shown in theatres. Given the limitations of the source material, the blu-ray could frankly have been an upscaled DVD a lot of the time, and I probably wouldn&apos;t notice the difference, but I am confident nonetheless that this represents an enormous upgrade over any previous home release this film may have had. This is a hell of a gritty film all shot handheld at night in high-ISO high-noise super-grainy 16mm film, and watching it in any kind of digitally over-compressed, bad transfer, or compromised way, would murky and confuse the aesthetic and greatly diminish the experience, so I think it&apos;s fantastic that Arrow is offering this restored version.\n\nThe allure of discovering Sogo Ishii&apos;s punk rock aesthetic on blu-ray persuaded me to blind-buy the Arrow blu-ray when it was announced, but I wasn&apos;t in a hurry to watch it, as I had no particular expectation for it. As it turns out, this is the surprise blu-ray release of the year, and the best film I&apos;ve newly discovered in some time. I hope some of Ishii&apos;s other films like Crazy Thunder Road and Electric Dragon 80,000V get similar releases soon.\n\nRoger Ebert once said of the 1995 film Fallen Angels by Wong Kar-Wai &quot;It will appeal to the kinds of people you see in the Japanese animation section of the video store, with their sleeves cut off so you can see their tattoos. And to those who subscribe to more than three film magazines. And to members of garage bands. And to art students.&quot; Well, none of those examples describes me exactly, but maybe I would fit right in with the types of people Ebert was talking about, because Fallen Angels is one of my most beloved movies. I wonder how he&apos;d describe the hypothetical target audience for this film...",

      "reviewBody": "This is surely one of the best movies about art I&apos;ve ever seen. It manages to surprise on many different levels. It avoids completely biographical approach which is a main starting point for most movies of this kind of subject. Even paintings are very few to be seen. Instead, the movie concentrates on something, which is far more essential - the state of the mind of the artist. I was astonished how close the movie was to the feeling I have got from the paintings by Klimt. It also captures the special a kind of decadent flavor of the end of a historical (Austrian-Hungarian empire) as well as an artistic epoch. But it also captures something, which could be called the inner world of the artist and does it in a convincing and magnificent way. Therefore it far exceeds a mere depiction of the life and art of Gustav Klimt - it&apos;s not movie about art but an artwork itself. And it&apos;s an artwork which is very close to the artworks by the hero of this movie - dreamy and magical, exuberant and saturated with symbols.\n\nThe first time I saw it, it was a sheer pleasure for senses. The music is one of the best movie scores I&apos;ve ever heard - full of references toward the works by Berg, Mahler and Richard Strauss, which contribute in a hypnotic way to the overall effect of this movie. But because the movie is so rich and full of connotations and details one cannot grasp by first viewing, it made me want to watch it many times more. And if somebody found it boring - sorry, but this says probably more about the viewer than about the movie.\n\n10 out of 10",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw this film as a child but its images haunted me for many years. This terrifying film has rarely been broadcast since, but was recently shown on American Movie Classics and I found it as frightening as I remembered. It is notable for the performance of the legendary acting teacher, Uta Hagen, whose film and TV appearances are limited but whose teachings are highly regarded in the acting world. Her role as Ada, the Russian grandmother of mysterious twin boys with a terrible secret, is perhaps not one of the great roles in film history, but her performance lends the film a tragic depth which makes the events seem all the more horrible. TV&apos;s John Ritter also has a small but important role as another member of the family beset by crises and dire events. And the late Portia Nelson, one of the nuns from THE SOUND OF MUSIC, also makes an appearance. Like many horror films of the 70&apos;s, this film sets a child&apos;s innocence against a malevolent force but, unlike The Exorcist or The Omen, doesn&apos;t involve supernatural elements. The horror is almost entirely psychological and involves the twins&apos; relationship and a grief-stricken family. It would be foolish to give away too many details because the plot twists and shocking ending are so effective, but this film, without explicit violence or gore manages, to make an impact and is a must-see for horror fans."

Brodie loses his license and tries to live with the loss.  However an closer look at a video of the accident reveals a second plane where a body was thrown to impersonate Chris.  Brodie investigates and uncovers a plot to capture sensitive information and return it to Russia.\n\nThis is a really fun film.  It&apos;s not meant to be a masterpiece or a deep political thriller.  It is meant to be a fun ride through exaggerated characters and silly set pieces.  The plot is almost pointless - it&apos;s just an excuse to hang the set pieces around.  However what you do get is Sheen overacting, great action scenes - the best being Sheen skydiving after a car which has Kinsji locked in the trunk.  You understand? - it&apos;s meant to be big dumb fun.  Personally I think this is better than a lot of big summer films that have big special effects scenes and ridiculous plots but try to take themselves seriously.  This knows it&apos;s all a bit unlikely but enjoys itself anyway.\n\nSheen is the key to the tongue-in-cheek approach.  He doesn&apos;t play a character - he almost just plays himself!  Even when he&apos;s in action scenes he&apos;s smiling - because he&apos;s having fun! and it makes me enjoy it a lot more. Kinski almost has as much fun in her role, but she has to carry a lot of the plot so she is more serious at time.  A pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini is menacing in his small bad guy role and Melvin Van Peebles makes an appearance to show that it&apos;s not just his son that can do daft films.\n\nOverall it&apos;s silly dumb fun.  Sheen enjoys himself so why can&apos;t you?"

      "reviewBody": "This movie covers the last few years of Georges Jacques Danton&apos;s life, from the era of the Tennis Court Oath to his death by guillotine five years later.\n\nThe film offers the viewer alternate scenes of spectacle, with crowds of hundreds shouting and waving liberty caps, varied with scenes of Lucie Mannheim clinging to Fritz Kortner in desperation. Gustaf Gründgens offers a performance as Robespierre as an egotist whose mania has consumed him, like a certain ex-president furious that when the FBI executed a warrant on his home, that they didn&apos;t take off their shoes in the bedroom. I would call it a Highlights Of History version of the story, but it ignores the forces that led to the revolution, and by ignoring them, turns it into a meaningless exercise. While I don&apos;t agree absolutely with Mark Twain that\n\n&quot;There were two &quot;Reigns of Terror,&quot; if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the &quot;horrors&quot; of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror-that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves&quot;,\n\nnonetheless, there&apos;s a truth in it, expressed better than I could. By ignoring it, this film makes the Revolution a meaningless coup. Perhaps that was the film makers&apos; intent.",

      "name": "A fine courtroom drama featuring the chemistry of Powell and Francis",
      "reviewBody": "But, for that matter, what movie did William Powell and Kay Francis team up in that wasn&apos;t a fine example of movie-making? William Powell plays William Foster, a flamboyant and successful defense lawyer that reminds me of Powell&apos;s Thin Man character except, unlike Nick Charles, William Foster is an unhappy man at his core. He gets drunk and pretty much stays that way to soothe this unnamed pain, not to add to the edge of a giddily happy life. His long-time lover, Irene Manners (Kay Francis), is the one thing he claims he can depend upon, but whenever he says this you get the feeling that he counts not even on that. Marriage is out of the question from Foster&apos;s standpoint, but Kay wants matrimony and finds someone who offers it in a less interesting package than Foster in the person of wealthy Jack Defoe. Jack and Irene meet late one night and take a ride in Jack&apos;s car to talk things out about the future - Irene is still unsure about how she wants to proceed. Irene is driving because Jack had been drinking. When Jack gets fresh, he causes the car to swerve and Irene hits a pedestrian. Jack sobers up quickly at this point and tells Irene to run away so he can claim responsibility for the wreck alone as he fears for Irene&apos;s reputation whether she is named as the driver or just a passenger. Unfortunately for Jack the pedestrian is dead. Also unfortunately for Jack, he still has the smell of alcohol on his breath when the police arrive.\n\nNow Jack is up for manslaughter. Foster has never liked Defoe because he considers him a spoiled brat, and now Irene is begging Foster to defend Defoe in spite of that, all the time trying to keep from Foster the fact that she was with Jack that night and that they were talking marriage. Defoe is maintaining the same charade as Irene. Meanwhile the district attorney and the police have had just about enough of Foster winning every case he takes and are keeping a close eye on his business practices. Who will go to jail? Will anybody go to jail? Watch and find out.\n\nWilliam Powell and Kay Francis were always great together because they usually played less than perfect people that made the perfect couple. Regardless of how things worked out for them at the end of their films, you just felt their characters were soul mates. This film is a great showcase of their talents when they were at the peak of their popularity in the 30&apos;s.",

There&apos;s no plot, no drama, no romance: a true disaster - movie! \n\nThe movie promises to be great family entertainment and set a cozy Christmas atmosphere. However the composition is totally bonkers, with many random scenes thrown in which have absolutely no ties to what little there is of the main storyline. This makes for an anodyne, confusing and frustrating experience. The movie pretends to want to take you on a great journey, but never gets you anywhere.\n\nSupposedly this movie is riddled with famous actors... however the only one who doesn&apos;t seem to be a robot or isn&apos;t grotesquely overplaying his part is the minister (Played by Poul Bundgård), who actually manages to make his character come to life in a meaningful way. However this is not at all enough to save the movie.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this movie was that it made us discuss the danish sense of nationality and found that it is comparable to a small monkey in the corner of the room, playing with itself.",

An interesting film, we see several great shots of dolly&apos;s with the early staircase scene. Several well shot montages with wonderful dissolves and sound bridges. For 1929, Hitchcock shows the world with the film that he&apos;s a talented film maker. A risky scene, the audience gets to watch the main actress of the film undress behind her curtains. While the murder is never seen, the provocative and private scene of her undressing is present. Another interesting note, the main character of the film is the murderer! Throughout the film, the audience judges whether or not she is an innocent murderer or a killer. Hitchcock makes an early name for himself with this film with toying with the audience throughout the suspense of the film.",

The movie combines comedy (and some parts are definitely funny) with romance in a tender-hearted tale of friendship and growing up. I simply cannot recommend this movie highly enough except to say that this is a film I could watch multiple times. Brilliantly acted by a still maturing cast ensemble, witty dialogue, it&apos;s got it all. If you want to see something that with touch you and give you a buzz but you don&apos;t want to be assailed by profanity, violence, or sexuality - That Thing You Do! is the movie for you. Another Hanks triumph, not just for his role in the movie but for putting it all together.  8/10",

Not that the humor is that intelligent, it just doesn&apos;t hit you over the head with obvious jokes. It is a take off on the &apos;real&apos; &apos;cookie cutter&apos; hostage dramas, and the fun it makes of them is subtle. (For example, the cops&apos; reaction, after disbelieving that Larry has brought explosives taped to his bike, when it is &apos;revealed&apos; to them that he obtained them in Jersey. There is no over the top joke, but it is VERY funny if you are paying attention and have enough common knowledge to get it).\n\nUnfortunately, there probably just aren&apos;t enough &apos;intelligent viewers&apos; out there for this film to get its due. There certainly weren&apos;t among the others leaving comments about it! LOL",

Winky is allowed to groom the horse of Sinterklaas (Saint Nicholas, who celebrates his birthday on December 5th by giving children presents, more or less known as Santa Claus in other countries). She does it with a lot of love and is quite happy with the task. When her parents tell her she&apos;ll be getting horse riding lessons for her next birthday she&apos;s thrilled and assuming it&apos;ll be on that specific horse. As events roll by the title of the film is explained - the horse disappears and trouble arises.\n\nAs a typical children&apos;s film about moral, good and bad, confessing mistakes and such this one is not a film to bring many surprised looks on the faces of the audience. Kids that liked the first one will like this sequel, and parents that get dragged along will not be completely bored for it is actually worked out pretty well. The acting of the kid that plays Winky is done well enough to make the character feel completely believable and the other events happening are in place far enough to be accepted too.\n\nThe overall sequence of the film feels much like the old style Disney films where things start good, get bad and end good, but that isn&apos;t bad. It feels good and works well on the targeted audience - kids in the age group of 4 to 8 years.\n\nNice enough, 7 out of 10 horses groomed",

The story has some big holes, but is one of the better Dracula films in the Hammer series. You get what you generally can expect from Hammer:  good character acting, lush cinematography, dutiful direction(ably done by Peter Sasdy), Christopher Lee(alas no Peter Cushing), beautiful young girls showing lots of cleavage, wonderful period costumes, and the film&apos;s shining grace is the score by James Hermann which is simply poetry put to music.  Ralph Bates stands out as a Lord Courtly living a life of sin and debauchery.  Good Hammer Fun!",

Herr Allégret put the trip in images and used the same title to make his first silent film. This frenchified director would soon embark on a successful career in the talkies.\n\nHerr Gide&apos;s book criticized openly French colonialism and financial interests of that European country in their African colonies but Herr Allégret&apos;s documentary is more focused on anthropological and ethnological aspects.\n\nIn those early silent years, to watch &quot;Voyage Au Congo&quot; was a kind of enlightening exercise, an excellent chance for curious audiences to discover different cultures, customs and behaviours. Audiences watched the film without reference to political matters or any controversy. Instead they saw various African tribes and how they lived their daily lives (farming, harvesting) and their own individual customs (their special soirees and dances, marriage rituals, etc).\n\nAs this German count said &quot;Voyage Au Congo&quot; is an interesting example of the documentary genre thanks to its didactic aspect but it must be noted that inherently in this film genre exists what this German count calls the &quot;documentary imposture&quot; or reality manipulation, harmless in this oeuvre that covers daily situations and uses those images only for artistic interests ( the engagement process, some tribal dances and customs ) and for the sake of illustrative film aspects but more terrible in other cases when the director changes or subverts the reality to serve his own interest.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must dance Teutonic and aristocratic dances.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "When the history of cinema is written a hundred years from now, Woody Allen&apos;s name will pop up quite a few times. Actor. Writer. Director. Comedian. The quintessential Jewish-American man. From Seinfeld characters to Family Guy to The Simpsons, so much of American pop culture is littered with characters based off the persona that Allen immortalised.\n\nBut in Woody Allen: A Documentary, documentarian Robert B. Weide seeks to get inside the mind of this endlessly parodied, forcibly stereotyped individual. Allen is his usual self-deprecating Jewish-American self, but it&apos;s the supporting cast – Diane Keaton, Naomi Watts, Scarlett Johansson, et al. – who really paint the best picture. We learn about Allen&apos;s directing techniques; what made him such a magnetic &apos;leading man&apos;; and how his personal life affected (or didn&apos;t, really) his professional life.\n\nAs all movie fans will know, Allen is responsible for some of the greatest movies of the modern era. Annie Hall is constantly cited as a great Hollywood classic, as are other accomplishments like Hannah And Her Sisters and Manhattan. The documentary moves chronologically through his back catalogue, discussing his intentions about each movie, the filmmaking process, and the critical reception. You listen to the cast, his family, and Allen himself discuss just how much of himself was present in his movies. What I loved most about the film is that it doesn&apos;t pander to Allen. Yes, this is a documentary about the man, so it does celebrate his brilliance as an artist. But Weide doesn&apos;t hold back in exploring the mistakes he made, both in his personal and professional life. In particular, his relationship with cinematic muse Mia Farrow is chronicled, painting Woody as a very conflicted and somewhat selfish man.\n\nWhat you take away from this documentary is appreciation for what Allen has achieved, and what he has brought to modern cinema. To continue to beat to his own drum at a time when studios have pigeonholed directors so much is admirable, especially when he&apos;s making one film a year. It&apos;s so easy (and so romantic) to see cinema as an artform. Woody Allen shows that it is a skill, a technique constantly being honed. Good stuff.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Time After Time&quot; was one of those movies of which I didn&apos;t even knew it existed. It certainly is a movie that deserves more recognition for this movie truly was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while.\n\nThe story its concept is already one factor why I liked this movie so much. In the late 19th century The scientist H.G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell) has build a time machine which his good friend John Leslie Stevenson aka Jack the Ripper (David Warner) uses when the police has just discovered his true identity. Ripper travels to the year 1979 and Wells, who feels responsible for his escape to the in his eyes future Utopian society of 1979, follows him to the future, in an attempt to catch him and bring him to justice and prevent him from making more victims in the future. I highly enjoyed this original story and concept and thought that it was perfectly executed by talented director Nicholas Meyer, who made his debut as a director with this movie. After this he made two more well known and widely appreciated Star Trek movies; &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; which by the fans are often regarded as the best in the series of Star Trek movies. \n\nThe movie has a fantastic and typical &apos;70&apos;s atmosphere which I always adore in movies. It&apos;s also filled with some typical &apos;70&apos;s tense chase sequences, which are brilliantly filmed and edited. The cinematography itself is also at times refreshingly original, especially the perfectly done opening sequence of the movie in which Jack The Ripper makes another victim. \n\nBut the movie isn&apos;t just tense and original, it also is highly entertaining and it features some good humor. Of course having an 19th century main character who for the first time takes a look in the future 1979 is already good for some laughs. Such as the time were he visits a McDonald&apos;s or comes up with the fake alias Sherlock Holmes when he gets in contact with the police. There are countless &apos;little&apos; fun parts like this in the movie which makes this movie a pleasant and entertaining one to watch as well as a tense nail biting thriller.\n\nMalcolm McDowell is extremely good and convincing as a 19th century gentleman and scientist H.G. Wells. Honestely he plays his best role since &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. David Warner is also perfectly cast as Jack The Ripper. He&apos;s a perfectly scary and mysterious gentleman. Warner is perhaps well known to everyone for playing Spicer Lovejoy in the 1997 movie &quot;Titanic&quot;. The movie also features a at the time still very young Mary Steenburgen in one of her very first movie roles. She also was superb and the talent was already showing. One year later she even already won an Oscar for the movie &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot;.\n\nThe movie further more features a highly good and underrated musical score by well known Hungarian composer Miklós Rózsa. \n\nThis movie is terribly underrated in terms of how well known it is. This movie deserves to be seen by everybody for this movie is an entertaining one as well as a tense thriller, with some excellent performances by the cast and good directing by Nicholas Meyer.\n\n8/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

But THIS IS the movie! \n\nTitles keep popping up for each new location - so often I&apos;m surprised they don&apos;t start with &quot;INT/EXT&quot;, &quot;DAY/NIGHT&quot;, etc. One of them actually states (and this is no joke) &quot;Friday 4:00PM ... 60 Hours Till Monday.&quot; What?? \n\nWhenever a new character appears, half the screen goes black and a white title appears to give their name and occupation/relevance/etc. Even if it&apos;s their only scene! One guy gets shot and killed 20 seconds after his name is given. But who cares... I don&apos;t even remember any of their names anyway.\n\nThe film editing is atrocious... constantly going into slow motion, freeze frames, or flashes of light and dark.\n\nThe actors are terrible and sound like they&apos;re reading lines. The rape scenes are not horrific OR haunting because it all feels so scripted.\n\nThis movie is without a doubt one of the most ANNOYING films I&apos;ve ever seen.",

Along the way, they find out there is a plot behind it and they work together to fight the bad guys.\n\nThere are quite a few problems with the movie. The plot is implausible. The DOA logo gets an on screen appearance too much that is very annoying. The love relationships seem so poorly built up that it exists just for the sake of existing. Not to mention the numerous soft porn scenes that make the film look cheap. Oh, and Devon Aokiwears the same facial expression on her face all the time, and her dialogs are spoken in such a plain and mundane way that is devoid of any emotion.\n\nHowever, there are good things about the film. The film is pure brain-off entertainment. The fight scenes are very well thought out and rehearsed. This alone makes the film fun to watch."

      "reviewBody": "Adaptation (2002)\n\nI adapted. I evolved. My second take on this movie was a turnaround from the first, when I thought it was needlessly complicated and self-absorbed. After all, the lead character is the screenwriter, and he&apos;s so full of himself and his self-pitying diary entries he has an identical twin to double the narcissism. I remembered enjoying it, but thinking it wheedling and grad school ultra-clever, too.\n\nBut that&apos;s not it at all. This is a movie that is all about plot construction but not about being inside the plot in the normal viewer-filmmaker way. For me, I couldn&apos;t just watch to see what was going to happen next. Things happen, there is a true climax of an ending, but it&apos;s how they happen that matters. The layering of time frames is paralleled by the layering of realities--until you realize that it&apos;s all real, and that the supposed movie being written is and isn&apos;t the movie we are watching. Or if it is, totally, and we see it&apos;s genesis on screen, it is still a screenplay about something real. Or not, once you see that the book, &quot;The Orchid Thief,&quot; which is a real book by Susan Orlean, is not &quot;Adaptation&quot; at all, but just a thread for Kaufman to weave these different personalities and plots together. \n\nFiction or fact, who cares? Well, that&apos;s part of the film&apos;s cunning--there&apos;s even a cameo of John Malkovich at the start, and a shot of that famous Being John Malkovich set of the half sized floor 7 ½ in an office building. And for the record, there is a Ghost Orchid that grows in the Everglades, Polyrrhiza lindenii, and yes, you can now buy it legally from growers with greenhouses. But Charles Kaufman the very real screenwriter (Being John Malkovich, of course, and Synecdoche, New York) is played by an actor, Nicholas Cage, with Cage&apos;s usual nervous ticks and uneasiness. Perfect for this role.\n\nBut does it all work? On the brain, yes. It&apos;s fascinating and engrossing, the work of a screenwriter showing off his chops. Is there suspense? Not really, even though it involves thieves and guns and romance. More telling, do we care about the characters? Nope again. Not for me. I&apos;m curious about these people--Meryl Streep as the writer of the book, and Chris Cooper as the orchid thief are both right on--but not worried about their survival, in love or in life. Still, I had to see every minute because I wanted to see how these very disparate characters were used to construct the construction, to force a point.\n\nTo say the movie isn&apos;t original or well done is foolish. The director? The redoubtable Spike Jonze, who seems to have let Kaufman lead the way, so the filming, per se, is excellent without being notable. You can&apos;t quite tell he&apos;s a television commercial director, but once you find that out it makes sense, and the movie is broken into short pieces not unlike your average t.v. experience.\n\nTo say Adaptation isn&apos;t to your taste is, of course, very reasonable. But if you can watch it the way I did the second time, open to its inner meanderings and the jumping from layer to layer, open that is to the working of the narrative plot stripped bare, you&apos;ll be glued.",

There are interviews (including the famous one with Russell Harty from the mid-seventies), and other bits and pieces put together.  This was always the definitive line-up of the band, when their songs had spirit and their performances were technically accomplished with a touch of humour."

      "reviewBody": "I recently obtained a rather low-quality version of this film under its alternate title, &quot;30 door key&quot;. At first, I was not quite sure what to expect- seeing Crispin Glovers name on the opening credits and all, but I knew whatever it was going to be, at least it would be memorable. And it truly was, in the best most surreal of ways (I am a huge fan of all or most things in that dying surrealists view). This film focuses in the 1940&apos;s around a man, who is our main character, who has long since reached his adulthood, yet in the first five minutes of the film is visited by an old teacher of his, evoking long since buried feelings of misworth in his intimidating surity and presence. His old teacher as arrogant as he had chosen not to remember up until this point, repremands the main character into attending a re-education school of sorts, to learn to write and be mature- that everything he had worked towards was suddenly dismissed as a pipedream illusiory success (don&apos;t ask me, you have to dismiss belief for the primary of this film). He goes to a school filled with grown adult school children, where there are the bullys and the bullied, the ego competition just as in reality, only now over the most obscure lesser thought of practices. Crispin Glover plays an at first arrogant, but eventually likable anti-establishment man-boy who befriends the main character and acts as a catalyst to what the main charcter looks towards to get more in touch with the spirit of living, which was a more free reflection on his former self. Its all very difficult to explain in the strictest sense, but the movie goes on- and I will not spoil it for anyone- too many different points and twists to name here, but this was a very fun film to watch. All the performances are excellent, and I could not reccomend this film more. It sounds so forced typing it out, but I thought I should at least try, as my subjects title states. final word, all in all: I leave you with a great big huge &quot;woo&quot; to let it all settle in good with you.",

And it is also spiced up with a good, wholeheartedly storyline.\n\nThe story in the movie is about Cha Eun-jin, a female gangster boss, whom is forced to live out her dying sisters last wish; that being to see her married. And while having no suitable romances, her henchmen are sent out to find a man for her to marry. She ends up tying the knot with a man unknowing of her true nature and line of work.\n\nThere is a good amount of action throughout the movie, with the fight sequences being quite nicely choreographed. And the action part of &quot;My Wife is a Gangster&quot; is a necessary aspect to the movie, as this is a gangster movie, after all.\n\nAnd there is also a good amount of comedy throughout the course of the movie, especially in the parts where Cha Eun-jin has to become feminine and let go of her rugged, masculine, gangster mentality. And the situation with the gangster wife and the unsuspecting husband also does incur some hilarious moments.\n\nWhat works in favor of the movie is the characters, as they are detailed, memorable and outstanding; and that goes from the main characters and right down to the goons in the gangster family. Lots of nice details and colorful characters throughout the movie. And actress Eun-Kyung Shin does a good job in the lead role.\n\n&quot;My Wife is a Gangster&quot; is a good movie for an introduction to the wonderful world of the South Korean cinema, if you are not already familiar with it. It is an entertaining movie and can actually been watched more than once. I have seen it three times by now, since I stumbled upon the movie somewhere back in the mid-2000&apos;s.",

Her role as a spoiled actress is greatly ironic, &apos;cause most narrow-minded viewers have only looked at her in this respect for over a decade. By playing this role with such finesse, she maybe proves to be exactly the opposite.\n\nIf you don&apos;t like Theo van Gogh as a person, please don&apos;t take that as an excuse to bomb his movies. &quot;Interview&quot; shows his (and Holman&apos;s) talent. The way Pierre and Katja don&apos;t want to be in the same room with each other, but can&apos;t leave each other at the same time; the way this is combined in &quot;Interview&quot; made me proud of Dutch cinema.

Liliom flirts with the ladies and plays to the crowd, and we find ourselves charmed. It wears off as he begins putting the moves on a beguiled young woman (Madeleine Ozeray), because it turns out he&apos;s quite a rake. He begins living off her and abusing her besides, in one scene slapping her, and in others alluding to beating her. I won&apos;t say more about the plot, except to say it takes a very interesting turn when he reluctantly agrees to commit a crime with his low-life buddy (Pierre Alcover). \n\nLang is very creative in this film, keeping us offbase as to where the film is going and capturing nice shots with reflections and shadows. At one point Boyer is mired in bureaucracy waiting for a form to be stamped, which is a comical moment. I had the film scored a little higher, but it dropped a little for me in just how light it got as it played out. The film was set up for much more interesting moments, and it seemed like a blown opportunity when it got silly. I was also not a fan of one of the film&apos;s messages, that out of love in a relationship &quot;someone can beat you, and beat you, without hurting you at all.&quot; Watch this one for the unique role Boyer plays (apparently one of the actor&apos;s favorites), and to see Fritz Lang&apos;s only French film, made shortly after he left Germany.",

      "reviewBody": "Boogeyman is pretty much your standard horror movie which tries too hard to be different, but in reality, is about the same as every mediocre new horror movie that comes out nowadays.\n\nBarry Watson stars as Tim Jensen, who since he was a young child, has been afraid of the Boogeyman that not only lives in his closet, but seems to be able to beam himself to any closet in the world and he uses that power to take those who Tim loves. We are treated to a decent scene at the beginning, where Tim is a child and witnesses his father being taken by the evil Boogeyman. The entire movie is basically Tim running from the dark, similar to Darkness Falls in a way.\n\nBoogeyman does do some things right, however. For instance, it makes you wait until nearly the end to see the Boogeyman face to face, but this is very anti-climatic. You never get a clear look and when you do, it looks like a human painted black. Not much to it there. The feel of the movie was great, with the eery sound effects of the wind whistling and the house always creaking. In surround sound, this has quite a creepy effect, but when it is non-stop and in every location, it becomes tiresome. Other than a few scenes that are designed to make you jump, there is not much else to this movie. The ending leaves you less than satisfied and not even sure what just happened. I give 4.5 of 10 stars.",

Yes it made me hate Moody and his family - and why not it portrayed their evil. And evil is exactly what they were so the movie did exactly what it should have. I think this movie is another great insight as to what goes on in the middle east and certainly doesn&apos;t deserve any of the criticism found in these forums.",

The only pro is that they finally made a Peter Pan film with a Native American Tiger Lily, otherwise there&apos;s nothing to like about this film. Stick to Hook, the only real live action Peter Pan worth watching. Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman will always be Peter Pan and Captain Hook.",

She&apos;s a key witness in a grand jury probe, and  also has a payoff list linking gang members to the LAPD. Most of the film&apos;s action takes place on board the train taking Brown and Neil to Los Angeles, where she will testify.In Mrs. Neil, played to perfection by Windsor, the queen of B movies, the tough talking, wise-cracking Brown meets his match. On the way to meet her, he glibly tells his partner, Gus Forbes that &quot;She&apos;s the sixty cent special. Cheap. Flashy. Sticky poison under the gravy.&quot; When he and Forbes, both from Los Angeles, first meet her, she says, &quot;How nice. How Los Angeles.&quot; Then looking Brown up and down, she snarls, &quot;Sunburn wear off on the way?&quot; My favorite wisecrack occurs after Brown has finally had enough of her wise remarks and lashes out, &quot;You make me sick to my stomach.&quot; Her retaliation is a gem: &quot;Well, use your own sink.&quot; Unlike the banter between Nick and Noira Charles of The Thin Man series, there&apos;s nothing the least sophisticated about the way Brown and Neil talk each other. Director Richard Fleischer uses inventive camera work, the sounds of the train rather than a music score, and the train&apos;s claustrophobic atomsphere to create and sustain tension. An RKO picture, The Narrow Margin is an unpretentious, taut low-budget thriller, a minor classic far superior to the 1990 Gene Hackman-Anne Archer remake."

      "reviewBody": "Starbuck (2011)\n\nThis might look like a bad movie—a silly idea and a goofy promo photo. And it&apos;s in French, so American audiences south of Canada are relatively small. But it&apos;s far more genuine than it portends. It&apos;s funny and warm. It&apos;s clever. It&apos;s improbable and impossible, sure, but that&apos;s part of the joyous fantasy of this weirdly feel-good film.\n\nThe premise starts pretty simply—an eager sperm donor (for money) finds out his sperm was used a lot. And with great success. Hundreds of babies were conceived. And now a group of over a hundred have banded together as a class- action group to demand his identity be released.\n\nBecause of the suit, he finds all this out and is shocked. Then, because the court has all the plaintiffs listed in detail, he is able to find the people, one by one. And so it goes. He meets. He does good deeds. He keeps his mouth shut. And in the process he begins to see the situation from the point of view of these 20 year old kids.\n\nIn this country you could picture Ben Stiller or similar comic actor taking the role. Here it is Patrick Huard, a Canadian French-speaking actor. And it turned into a hit (the most popular film in Quebec in 2011). Huard makes his character compelling, even as all these ridiculous things are happening around him. Watch it for his performance alone.\n\nOr watch it for the warm and fuzzy aspects that are really a surprise given the comic plot. Fun and well done!",

John Ireland does a good job being the quiet, likable kidnapper type.\n\nSnub Pollard from the Laurel and Hardy days is here in a small role. Look for his mustache.\n\nA fill up of gasoline and a check of the oil comes to $4 at full service. That seemed a little high, but it was a name brand station.\n\nThe plot is your basic girl/race car driver being kidnapped by the only young guy in town. This is after she is hit on by the local truck driver/detective wannabe senior citizen who remains unconscious for most of the film.\n\nThis was probably an excellent movie for a rainy night at the drive-in theater. This film has some nice moments.\n\nIf you like John Ireland, watch Red River for one of his earlier roles. Dorothy Malone did a movie I enjoyed called The Last Voyage.\n\nTom Willett",

Here are a few of the stories of people who died from AIDS, told by their survivors.\n\nMore than three quarter of a million Americans have died from AIDS since we began to notice it, about forty years ago. Worldwide, the figure seems to be a bit more than 40 million. Do a little math, and we as a nation look lucky. Human lives are not measured statistically, and people do not die by nations, but individually. Try to speak of the enormity of something, saying eighty million people have died from AIDS, or 6.9 million from COVID-19 or what have you and the horror and sadness gets lost in the the crowd. But one by one, with those they leave behind to assess the values of those lives. &quot;My son died&quot;; &quot;My lover died&quot;; &quot;My friend Jim died&quot;: these are the words that make me weep.

This is one of those movies that achieve cult-status as &quot;So bad that are funny&quot; like the infamous and great &quot;Troll 2&quot;. The rocker Thor is the lead here. The plot is about a rockn roll band in some house that are attacked one by one by demons. This demons are very cheap and stupid-looking puppets. The bad thing in this one is that most of the killings are off-screen and there isn&apos;t enough nudity. Not the perfect party movie IMHO but a good one to have a laugh with friends and lots of booze.\n\n6/10"

      "reviewBody": "A New York psychiatrist , Dr. Bartholomew Snow (Rock Hudson) is inveigled by General Prat (Jack Warden) and his operatives into treating a disturbed scientist whose discoveries are fundamental to the Cold War effort and who is held in a secret location necessitating a blindfold for the shrink on route , but sinister surprises lurk in the dark. He then engages in a thorny espionage with noted scientist (Alejandro Rey) wanted by certain foreign powers, later on , international terrorists intervene , Hudson soon finds himself caught in the middle and out of desperation, he joins with the boffin&apos;s showgirl sister , Vicky Vincenti (Claudia Cardinale) who also happens to be a brave and fiery woman, both of whom attempt to retrace his steps and save the day . As Bartholomew stubbornly retraces his route by means of clues and sounds to discover the actual source of the original location. Then a trailing cop (Brad Dexter) and his chief (Robert F. Simon) enter the fray . Living Dangerously . . . And loving every minute of it!. Bullets and Brunettes...in a Blind Alley 15 miles wide, 2,000 miles long and 20 high...and time running out !. Deadly...Dangerous...The Game is...Blindfold...The less you see...the longer you live...when you&apos;re wrapped in the danger of Blindfold..Behind the Blindfold is the greatest security trap ever devised. A blind alley paved with deadly danger!\n\nAn acceptable and twisted thriller/comedy with explosive conflict of world-shattering espionage , including suspense , intriguing events , twists and turns . It displays a charming cast , but the uneven filmmaking falters in film that wavers from mystery , thriller, action-packed to comedy . It contains inappropriate slapstick scenes and some fights in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer style seem incongrous . Main ans support cast are pretty well . Rock Hudson gives a sympathetic acting in his usual style as a psychiatrist treating patients with emotional problems who&apos;s solicited by government agents in connection with a former one. While Claudia Cardinale as his beautiful partner is extremely sympathetic and really gorgeous.they are finely supported by nice and familar secondaries providing stunning interpretations , such as : Jack Warden , Guy Stockwell, Brad Dexter , Anne Seymour , Alejandro Rey, Hari Rhodes, Vito Scotti , Angela Clarke , Mort Mills , Robert F. Simon. And brief apperances , almost extras , from Bruce Glover , Charles Horvath, Roy Jenson , Chuck Roberson, Norman Alden, among others.\n\nIt displays lively and thrilling musical score by veteran composer Lalo Schifrin . Colorful cinematography in Technicolor by the splendid director of photography by Joseph MacDonald . Shot on location in Ocala, Florida , New York City, and Universal Studios California . The motion picture was uneven and professionally directed by Philip Dunne , though he seems to have trouble sustaining it , lapsing into thudding comedy and silly action. Distinguised screenwriter Dunne had also made ten movies in the former decade before his career came to an almighty stop with this mediocre but at times decent thriller. Dunne was one of the founders of the American Screen Writer&apos;s Guild and along with director William Wyler and John Huston, he formed the Committee for the First Amendment to protest the procedures of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Dunne was an expert writer , getting some successes , such as Anne of the Indians , Sinuhé, the Egyptian , The Robe , Martin the Gaucho , Pinky , David and Betsabe , The Ghost and Mrs Muir , Demetrius and the Gladiators , Lydia Bailey . And he directed some movies as Blindfold , El inspector , Wild in the Country , 10, calle Frederick , Three Brave Men , Hilda Crane , The view from Pompey&apos;s Head . Blindfold(1966) rating : 5.5/10. Acceptable and passsable flick, but neither notable , nor extraordinary , but mildly decent . The pic will appeal to Rock Hudson and Claudia Cardinale fans .",

      "reviewBody": "If it wasn&apos;t for the calendar right next to my computer everything would seem like back in wonderful 1992. Whacky romantic comedy standards, bubbly chic, haughtily evil Putonghua speakers and egotistical Westerners. Why, there&apos;s even a schmaltzy Mandopop moment to floor your hearts with nostalgic joy. \n\nNot surprising as a product from Mr. Derek Yee, craftsman behind earlier classic One Nite in Mongkok. Yee has a gift, his movies always make Hong Kong look good and brimming with a sense of place that real-life residents find endearing as they don&apos;t always see it the same way actually living there. Furthermore, a typically stolid cast of characters, especially those in support of main protagonists, imbue Drink, Drank, Drunk with its layers of fun and eccentricity, without which it may have ended up an OK but ho hum comedy romp.\n\nDDD has been getting PR of the sort usually reserved for brainless fodder, understandable in light of its summery release and the kind of audiences distributors are going for. However, it&apos;s very much akin to Crazy n the City of a few months ago in that there&apos;s so much more here than meets the eye, with the gaudy comedic thrills working magically en route to one of the better motion pictures of the year thus far. \n\nAlthough awash with blatant product placement (especially Budweiser), DDD transpires to be a superb feel good movie full of wit and charm, as well as whole-blooded, cynical laughs that, for a change, work. It stars Miriam Yeung and Daniel Wu together again, re-enacting their old magic from those heady Love Undercover days. The pair has good chemistry, and it&apos;s put to great use throughout, with Yeung&apos;s natural affinity for humor tuning effortlessly to Wu&apos;s diverse range of macho-sensitive capabilities. \n\nYeung does Siu Min, a Bud booster trawling the city&apos;s bar and restaurant areas along with ditzy co-workers Toby and Rene. Their lot is a happy but uneasy one, facing rival beer grrrls and the ever present search for good men. Siu Min, on the other hand, has given up trying to pinpoint her chevalier, raising concerns among friends regarding her sexual orientation. Speaking of friends, we have quite the entourage on hand, including satisfying performances by Vincent Kok as Yeung&apos;s decidedly gay employer and Stephen Fong, again sporting his by now obligatory facial hair. Fong plays Brother Nine, the local triad boss and Siu Min&apos;s protector, who&apos;s also keen on seeing her married off to some unsuspecting victim.\n\nAs a capper, Siu Min&apos;s notorious for her immunity to alcohol. She can put them away at no risk, something that can&apos;t be said for sentiment. When she meets rolling stone Michael (Wu), Siu Min soon develops a dependence and the two fall for each other. Wu performs well, too. His character, a vagabond French chef with huge dreams and a knack for whipping up the most excruciatingly bizarre cuisine, teams up with Siu Min as they build a professional and personal relationship, much to the puzzlement of those around them.\n\nLater on, temptation arrives via one of Michael&apos;s sojourning buddies, tempting him to relinquish the urbane existence he&apos;d forged with Siu Min and head back down the endless road of adventure. And before you know it, a super-wealthy, attractive female entrepreneur sets her sights on Michael both romantically and as management for her chain of ultra pricey outlets. This adds turbulence to our antic lovers&apos; steadfast course, but needless to say there&apos;s hope yet.\n\nOn the face of it, DDD may seem not too special. Having said that, it feels more like a genuine HK product than anything we&apos;ve seen over the season so far, and despite its mainstream accoutrements possesses a free-wheeling spirit fit for a release much more critical-indie by nature. Gags and jokes present good writing and an eye for ridiculing the contemporary rather than the bland, while Yee&apos;s pacing remains intact: there&apos;s hardly a slow or boring moment. The cast carries out respective roles with confidence, as we get a slew of classic fixtures that have served this genre faithfully for decades, from bitchy beauties to rough but ludicrous mobsters and senile old grannies at street corners.\n\nThose hankering for a slice of what Hong Kong romantic comedies used to be like before the city&apos;s movie industry began atrophying will immediately realize Drink Drank Drunk provides more than an ample glance. It&apos;s funny, apt and nicely executed.\n\nRating: * * * *",

Presumably, one or two of these overgrown schoolboys playing buffoons were popular in themselves. Fashions come and go, however, and I doubt they would have a fan on the planet now. The drawn out slapstick gags come one after the other, each more unfunny than the last and all accompanied by the cast laughing uproariously to their own stunts. The lovely Edwige Fenech, of course is ravishing throughout, but deigns not to take her clothes off as much as in the first film. There must have been cinema-goers, like me now for instance, who might have been tempted to see the film just for the lady but I feel it has to be admitted that their really was an audience for this stuff in the late 70s. Pretty likely that some highly considered gems of today will look a little flat when the fame has faded away. Just worth it for Edwige.",

      "reviewBody": "If it were not based on a true story, Luc Besson&apos;s `The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&apos; would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile wide. Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world&apos;s most famous stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those mind-boggling historical incredibilities.\n\nJoan was, of course, the deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed were visions and voices sent directly by God - assuring her and France of a glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army - managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.   We first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety, attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and, eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape and murder of her beloved older sister.  We see the French royalty, so driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the brutal British onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories.  But glory is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it is gained  and Joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the English, tried by the Catholic Church, and burned at the stake by the English government for the crime of witchcraft.\n\nGiven this fascinating and astonishing series of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in interest and insight.  And, indeed, `The Messenger&apos; is, perhaps, a better film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would indicate.  The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of the tale.  The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all these military strategists would follow. But, about midway through the film, the screenwriters, Andrew Birkin and writer/director Besson, begin to apply some psychological depth to the character.  After a particularly sanguine encounter with the English, in which hundreds of decapitated and limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, Joan breaks down in despair over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight.  From then on, her actions arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic teachings of Christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an obsession for personal glory and power.  We&apos;re a long way from the astute psychological insights of Carl Dreyer&apos;s classic silent film version of the story, `The Passion of Jeanne d&apos;Arc,&apos; but `The Messenger&apos; does take occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the question of whether Joan&apos;s miracles were the product of divine intervention or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion borne of insanity.  Unfortunately, casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud  hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the stake.   Also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the film&apos;s era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.\n\nIn terms of dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable Hobson&apos;s Choice:  should the writers employ language that reflects the reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated by today&apos;s standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of `The Messenger&apos; have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she&apos;s nuts!&apos; and `I&apos;m gonna kill that f------ bitch&apos; along with a barrage of four-letter word expletives with which no contemporary PG-13 or R-rated feature could ever do without.\n\nThose with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence had best be forewarned:  the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited, register high on the bloodletting scale.\n\nOf the performers, none matches in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that adorn the film.   Milla Jovovich is, at best, adequate as Joan, rarely giving more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles occurring at the root of her personality.  John Malkovich, as the would-be French king, for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line, has his moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film to allow him to create a multifaceted performance.  Faye Dunaway brings a cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king&apos;s manipulative mother-in-law.\n\n`The Messenger&apos; emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews that greeted the work&apos;s initial release would lead one to believe."

I am not hooked on the story, or the basic premise, it&apos;s just not done well, or interesting enough, and then on top of that you have the fact that it&apos;s a BL, but it&apos;s one of those extremely explicit ones, verging on exploitation, and when I say verging I mean it is exploitative. There&apos;s no added value to showing that much in adult scenes other than to titillate and I am not the target demographic for that. So unfortunately it doesn&apos;t deliver for me on either fronts, I just finished episode 1 and I got plenty of spoilers on MDL so I concluded the story itself holds no interest for me, it&apos;s very whack, so no, thank you.\n\nAlso struggling with Not Me, also praised, but really not interested in that story either, although so far I got up to episode 4.",

      "reviewBody": "Three sisters, the Parisians with the sweet Russian names, Sonya, Lyuba and Milla and their parents who have been divorced for 25 years but still have a lot to say to each other are in the center of this charming, clever, funny, touching and poignant dramedy that takes place one year in Paris from December 20 till Christmas Eve. It will start with the funeral and it will end with the Christmas party in which all members of this dysfunctional family participate but many events will happen before the party, important decisions will be taken, life-changing revelations will occur and all of it with the background of incredible Paris decorated for Christmas and the sound of beloved Christmas songs and some unforgettable Russian and Jewish songs. Danièle Thompson directed a marvelous movie for which she and her son Christian (who also stars) wrote a script. Three beautiful and talented actresses play the sisters. Sabine Azéma is Lyuba, the older of the three (the songs that she performers in a Russian cabaret almost reduce me to tears), Emmanuelle Béart is Sonya, the only one of the sisters who seems to have found happiness in her picture perfect family life but there is more than meets the eye. Charlotte Gainsbourg (the daughter of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, a very talented young actress whom I like in everything I&apos;ve seen her) is Milla, the youngest sister, a brilliant computer programmer, the rebel and the loner who spends all her time at work.",

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love many Bollywood films, but let&apos;s face it, there&apos;s a formula. There&apos;s no formula in Raincoat. To explain in more detail: There&apos;s no dancing. Ashwarya looks pale and sullen not her usual drop-dead gorgeous. Most of the movie takes place in one room, so if feels like it was written as a play. And lastly, the pace and style seems very French in that the plot is deep and is revealed slowly.\n\nBecause an Indian film managed to do all this, I have to give it a 10. It&apos;s definitely in a league with great European films. But it&apos;s not better than great European films. The only weak point is Ajay Devgan&apos;s lack of expression in certain scenes. His dialogue reveals a man who is at times innocent and gullible, yet at other times he&apos;s an adroit liar. His facial expression only fit the latter. Annu Kapoor almost steals the movie away from him.\n\nAshwarya proves she can act in this film, and I applaud the director for giving her this role. Could any other young star have done any better? No. (But wouldn&apos;t Shabana Azmi have been magnificent?) See this movie if you love great films. Don&apos;t see it if you want to see a typical Bollywood film.",

I find an atmosphere of unbearable tension, depression, grief, apprehension,\n\nwatching two women living with some persistent post-traumatic stigma, unexplained, in a waiting that never ends. Something to do with the mother&apos;s unique, uncommunicable anguish over a very bad, violent, abnormal daughter. We never learn what she did or see her misbehave, we imagine the worst and her most innocent behavior seems unnerving, suggestive of evil. A double anguish, also having to do with a pair of depraved teenage boy killers on the loose in the neighborhood. Did they kill someone in the family? Or are they perhaps family members? Do the two women know something about these boys that the police don&apos;t? A numbed mood with its own rapturous nuances, separates them from the street world in front of the house, and the equally claustrophobic garden world in back of the house, the absolutely still house. Great actresses are denied the opportunity to act, a kind of negative violence which causes amazement and discomfort. By bizarre contrast, suddenly a radiant 24 year-old Depardieu, as an awkward vacuum cleaner salesman, gives a hilarious, virtuosic shaggy dog monologue out of Pinter or Beckett. Virtually his first film, it precedes his official filmography; what a discovery. The film goes nowhere, a fragment, a shard of smoky Durassian flint. The more Duras one already knows, the more one can appreciate this seemingly obscure and tedious film.",

I had previously caught a snatch of it while channel surfing cable TV, and saw enough in about 30 seconds to realise that this was worth watching through if I got the chance.\n\nI could barely speak at the end of the film. Pauline Kael called it one of the scariest movies ever made, and she was absolutely right. Robert Mitchum becomes the embodiment of evil, and his pursuit of the children is so relentless, and so menacing, that it becomes impossible to believe that they can escape. The images are brilliant; there&apos;s a depth to black and white that colour somehow lacks, and it is used superbly here to create a sense of brooding terror.\n\nI didn&apos;t mind the homily at the end. Like everything else in the film, it is done with utter conviction, and this makes it work. Charles Laughton saw it as the indispensable conclusion to the film, and the strength of his belief makes it indispensable.\n\nThe images are so much part of the film that it must lose a great deal on the small screen, although my minimal exposure to it in that environment showed that it was still well worth watching, but if you get a chance to see it in a cinema, jump at it.",

This is an early 20th century piece, with wonderful costumes, decor, and settings of the period, and lilting music for the most part...and as others have said Tommy Steele as the butler STEALS the show with his singing, dancing, and commentary on the goings on throughout the story.  I have on order the movie &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; which Tommy originated on the stage in London; am looking forward to this film also...I think we all miss the family oriented musicals, and movies of this time period;  they are so easy to view and so enjoyable...One final comment; what a wonderful way to end the movie with Fred MacMurray and Greer Garson doing a duet on &quot;Let them Go&quot;  a poignant ballad on their feelings of dealing with the empty nest syndrome...this was added for the roadshow version I believe, I don&apos;t recall it in the original version....Does anyone know whether Greer Garson&apos;s voice was used in this; I wasn&apos;t sure if she was a singer or not....at any rate I would recommend this film to any one..."

      "reviewBody": "Immediate background:Jacques Becker was dying when he filmed &quot;le trou,and he made it his legacy;it&apos;s the tragedy of man caught on the web of life -an admirable metaphor shows two wardens feeding a spider in the undergrounds with a fly-,and anyway unable to escape from the final death.\n\nThe first thing to bear is mind is that,calling &quot;le trou&quot; a &quot;prison movie&quot; would be an insult.Although adapted from a Jose Giovanni&apos;s book -Giovanni had been himself in jail for some time and his depictions are as close to reality as can be-,Becker masterfully transcends his subject and gives something definitely new.Some said it was the final link between &quot;la nouvelle vague&quot; and what the highbrows pejoratively -and thoroughly unfairly- call &quot;cinema de qualité&quot; but Becker had predated that overrated new wave by almost ten years :&quot;rendez-vous de juillet&quot; had already almost everything the young Turks would bring later.\n\nFirst shock is the use of the wide screen,the cinemascope,which Becker had never experimented before;and he achieved the impossible: using this device for a story which takes place ,either in the four walls of a jail,or in the undergrounds and the sewers .The only picture of the outside is seen when the two inmates open a manhole.And the second one is the sound:there&apos;s no music at all,except for the final cast and credits -saving the cast and credits for the end was very rare in the contemporary French cinema -But the soundtrack resembles some kind of musique concrete with its relentless thumps, the whispers and the screams inside the cell,the creaking of the doors ,the waters in the sewer;and the final cacophony -which is not unlike the one which Manliewicz used in &quot;suddenly last Summer&quot; the year before- packs a real wallop.\n\nAnother Becker&apos;s tour de force is his description of the prison life:he avoids all the clichés that mar so many &quot;prison movies&quot; (the overpraised &quot;Whatsisname redemption&quot; is no exception):here, the wardens are,most of the time ,kind and friendly,the relationships with the inmates remain polite ,maybe sometimes too much:particularly those between the young man (Marc Michel) and the head warden are almost paternalistic.\n\nAnother Becker&apos;s permanent feature comes back to the fore in &quot;le trou&quot; :friendship,solidarity ,which was already present in &quot;rendez-vous de juillet&quot; and &quot;touchez pas au grisbi&quot;.Here it&apos;s pure manly friendship and it seems that a certain misogyny is infiltrating Becker&apos;s world:during the 2 hours + running time of the movie,we only see one young girl (Catherine Spaak) behind a grille,for a very short while.The only positive woman whom we&apos; ll never see is (naturally) one of the five inmates &apos; s(Michel Constantin) mother(&quot;I almost killed her when I was sent to jail so I do not want to take a chance and try to escape&quot;)\n\nSPOILER:But even this world where five inmates share everything,where their friendship is &quot;more than I &apos;ve ever had &quot;(Marc Michel&apos;s character) is collapsing;the first cracks were already here in &quot;rendez-vous de juillet&quot; when some of the young students were giving up on their plans ,to the main hero&apos;s (Daniel Gelin)disappointment.But &quot;touchez pas au grisbi&quot; took friendship over everything including money.&quot;Le trou&quot; reveals the true nature of man,even if the informer seems completely desperate at the end of the movie.The mammoth task they did ,the hole &apos;(le trou) is nothing but a cul-de -sac and it epitomizes,in a Hustonian way -we&apos;re closer to Huston than to Godard ,fortunately,the vanity of everything man can do to escape from his fate,and in the case of Becker ,to escape from death.END OF SPOILER\n\nHad Becker ended his career with his three precedent movies (Ali-Baba,Arsène Lupin ,Montparnasse 19),his former masterpieces (Casque d&apos;or,Goupi Main Rouges ,rendez-vous de juillet),could have been tarnished by association.But &quot;Le trou&quot; ,his final masterpiece stands in little danger of bringing this about.",

Centuries of history and the famous medieval architecture of the place within its walls could disappear anytime if it wasn&apos;t for the efforts of historians and many other people and efforts like this movie made by Pasolini. \n\nIn &quot;Le Mura di Sana&apos;a&quot; (&quot;The Walls of Sana&apos;a&quot;), the director speaks on behalf of the simple residents, people who wouldn&apos;t be heard by officials and authorities, and wouldn&apos;t have the means to pledge to UNESCO for the city&apos;s preservation as a World Heritage Site. Pier Paolo Pasolini shows the historical importance of the city through its magnificent and beautiful architecture composed of ancient and resisting long buildings, dating from the medieval period - all viewed through the spectacular lenses of Tonino Delli Colli - the markets, villages, squares and makes an important contrast with his native Italy by presenting a small village that got surrounded by contemporary constructions and now you can&apos;t even see the place on the horizon because of the modernization imposed by &quot;evolution&quot;. &quot;We can&apos;t save Italy, but there&apos;s time to save Yemen&quot; says the narrator at its conclusion before his urgent messages to UNESCO. \n\nThe battle succeed, but the director wasn&apos;t here long enough to see it. As we all know, Pasolini got killed in 1975, and only in 1986 UNESCO would declare Sana&apos;a as a World Heritage Site to be preserved for future generations. But what matters is that the movie got made, the director made a very good point without taking too long to expose his facts and to defend his cause, and there&apos;s plenty to be learned from here. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "You don&apos;t need to be a Deanna Durbin fan to find this film delightful. It should appeal to anyone who enjoys traditional musicals like &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and &quot;Showboat&quot;. \n\nCan&apos;t Help Singing is filled with humor and wit, played with a wink to the audience and genuine gusto--not dated in the least. Akim Tamaroff is especially funny; you can clearly see how he was the model for &quot;Boris Badinov&quot; in the &quot;Bullwinkle&quot; cartoons. \n\nThe songs are first rate; Kearn&apos;s melodies are beautiful and Harburg&apos;s lyric to &quot;Californiay&quot; is full of wit, creativity, and surprises; his other lyrics are well done, but nothing special. \n\nAnother layer of delight and interest to someone who knows about the history of movie musicals, like myself, is how far ahead of it&apos;s time this film is. The large majority of it is filled outdoors, a lot of it on location. This is unique and innovative in an era when virtually all musicals were filmed inside sound stages with some use of the studio back lot. One of the musical numbers features Durbin in outdoor locations which vary from shot to shot, while she continues to sing seamlessly. This is something that became common a decade or more later, but certainly pioneering in 1944. \n\nDurbin and Paige are both fine singers, most likable, adept at playing the light humor their roles call for. This is a film that should be much better known and appreciated."

Mostly I would like the Pilot episode/movie more then anything else. I used to watch the show on YTV, I think, which is a channel for kids in Canada. I noticed that episodes of She-Ra are available on Video to buy through e-bay&apos;s half.com but not on DVD and certainly not &quot;Secret of the Sword&quot; which I find weird since that everyone first me She-Ra and other the characters from the cartoon."

      "reviewBody": "Watch Man Behind the Sun expecting something along the lines of a Chinese Ilsa movie and you might be in for a surprise: this film has none of the camp qualities to be found in most POW exploitationit&apos;s pure cinematic harshness from start to finish with not a buxom leather-booted commandant in sight.\n\nSet at the end of WWII, director T. F. Mous&apos; harrowing tale centres on Camp 731, a medical centre where the Japanese attempt to perfect bacterial weapons, using Chinese prisoners as guinea pigs in their nasty experiments. Mous&apos; objective is to reveal to the world how his people suffered at the hands of their enemy, and in this he totally succeeds; the atrocities that are depicted in Man Behind The Sun are completely sickening and disgustingly convincing.\n\nFrom the moment that a woman&apos;s baby is smothered in snow by a soldier, to the depressing, downbeat finalé in which the camp is razed to the ground by a retreating Japanese army (after shooting and burning all prisoners), this unflinching portrayal of man&apos;s inhumanity to man is a total gut-wrencher and certainly not recommended viewing for the easily offended.\n\nIn this film, people are treated worse than animals and the &apos;experiments&apos; they have to endure are shown in every nauseatingly graphic detail: a woman has her arms frozen and then dunked in hot water, allowing the flesh to be easily ripped from her bones; a prisoner is placed in a decompression chamber resulting in his intestines erupting from his body (a scene rumoured to use a real body, but which, according to the director, was actually achieved using special effects); a boy is tricked into being the subject of a live &apos;autopsy&apos; (cast-iron stomach necessary for this bitreal autopsy footage was shot for this scene!!); and a group of prisoners are &apos;crucified&apos; in a field and used for target practice by Japanese bombers.\n\nOn top of all this there are also two moments of animal cruelty that will have pet-lovers up in arms: a cat is thrown to hungry rats and is eaten alive (not sure if this was done with FX or not, but the cat doesn&apos;t look too thrilled), and a load of rats are also set on fire (now this is definitely real!!).\n\nAs you have probably gathered, Man Behind The Sun is hard going and should be watched with caution. However, it is a well made film that does what it set out do doeducate viewers about the horrors of war. It&apos;s a hard one to rate, because it is such a gruelling movie and can&apos;t really be described as entertaining, but I&apos;ll give it 8/10 for being so genuinely disturbing.",

Then societal norms usually require to embed these actions in a &quot;proper&quot; context.\n\nIn a well-known example of this, the German phrase &quot;Aber warum liegt hier überhaupt Stroh &apos;rum?&quot; is enough for that. But this lacks the &quot;artistic&quot; or &quot;intellectual&quot; checkmarks that need to be ticked for a film to be financed with 1,45 million Deutschmarks (at 1988 value) by the tax payer or favourably reviewed in &quot;serious&quot; newspapers.\n\nSo the script of this film adds a bunch of lines that feel like passwords in a spy movie: One character says something nonsensical, and then the other character immediately feels enough motivation to start copulating. This makes it feel like a writer&apos;s dream turned into moving pictures - where a doctor&apos;s attractivity does not stem from their socioeconomic status, but from a single sentence, easily imitable without having to study or work very hard.",

I have read many reviews from professionals and they all seem to think the movie is too theatrical and you can tell it was a stage play and that the mother is especially dramatic. She is, that&apos;s true, but in the same way Faye Dunaway chews up Mommie Dearest and we all know what a hoot that is. Little Rhoda is a real stinker. The handyman had better &quot;give her those shoes.&quot; The subplot of the mother&apos;s own identity is fun too. All in all, the movie is very 50s. You can almost see Wally and the Beaver coming down the street. Great! There is also some discussion about the formal introduction of the cast at the end which I&apos;ve always found a very nice touch. Much older films of the 30s used to do that all the time. It&apos;s been said this film did it to show the characters were just flesh and blood actors and so their roles and the subject matter (especially Patty McCormack) shouldn&apos;t be taken seriously. See it. By the way, there is one review on this site by someone who says they saw the movie at age 12 that is very negative. Don&apos;t believe it!"

Never getting preachy about friendship and never turning into a silly action flick, it&apos;s a movie that knows how to tell a story. Another good addition to Ridley Scott&apos;s filmography. And that one scene with the Dutch school girl...hubba hubba! On another note, this movie was my introduction to Ryan Phillippe, who plays one of the young men (although his name didn&apos;t enter my vocabulary until I saw &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;). Also starring are John Savage, Jeremy Sisto (Billy on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;), Ethan Embry and Zeljko Ivanek. Certainly worth seeing.\n\nI have to admit, I would never want to go sailing.

This is a film about a middle aged french man who after a family crisis travels on the spur of the moment to London only to get caught up in the male prostitution business and eventually drugs. The acting from Daniel Auteuil and Stuart Townsend is top draw and the story is strong enough to have you interested throughout the film. The only flaws in the film are that it is hard to believe that the man we see at the start of the film , who lacked confidance , could go on to become an escort and there is also a scene where we see him at a posh party and a drunk toff starts talking and the acting in that scene is appalling from the socialite. Dont let that put you what is a very good film. 8 out of 10.",

Then we&apos;ll ruddy well UNblock &apos;em!&apos; This is the point in the film where I feel like cheering, as it perfectly sums up Bader&apos;s &apos;can do, will do&apos; approach. It&apos;s the true story of Douglas Bader, a young flying enthusiast who went on to be a fearless WW2 Spitfire pilot, losing both legs in the process. His struggle to walk again, his courting of a pretty girl and his later formation of &apos;the big wing&apos; in the fight against the Nazi invasion are laid out here with gusto, verve and a little humour. Kenneth More is excellent as Bader, using his natural, relaxed acting technique to give the part a free-wheeling energy. The very pretty Muriel Pavlow plays his wife who grows increasingly concerned at his derring-do, and there is a solid cast of British regulars of the time. The music is stirring, the direction brisk and the story itself is straight out of a Boys&apos; Own comic. What more could you ask for? A perfect Sunday afternoon film.",

It`s also good to see some old fashioned buxom women who have never heard of the phrase silicone implants . That`s something you don`t see in horror movies nowadays I can tell you",

This classic of Argentine cinema has entertaining, variegated direction from the stalwart Amadori, with excellent production values, and an absolutely colossal, corking performance from the great Spanish-born star of stage and screen, Pedro López-Lagar, a fabulous figure quite reminiscent of Paul Muni. \n\nAlthough he was in his late forties when he made it, the handsome Lagar somehow manages to transform himself into a boy to play the adolescent Albéniz as a devil-may-care stow-away to Cuba. He eventually dons a most convincing old man makeup for the composers&apos; final yearsa dramatic license, as Albéniz was only 48 at the time of his premature death, and so exactly Lagar&apos;s own age when the movie was made.\n\nAs the film is also brimming over with Albéniz&apos; lovely music, this is a production to cherish and remember.",

      "reviewBody": "I loved this movie. OK I&apos;m English, a classic car nut and I love Chris Rea&apos;s music anyway but I found this movie really resonated with me. I especially loved the vintage movie sequences featuring old racing Ferraris and the late 50&apos;s &apos;jet set&apos; in their natural habitat. If you are of a certain age and European, I dare you to see this movie and not be moved by nostalgia for &apos;simpler times&apos;.\n\nThis movie was obviously a personal labour of love for Chris Rea. It unashamedly has the feel of an art-house project rather than the boringly formulaic over-productions that the Hollywood megastudios excrete. I understand others who have had little exposure to anything else might misinterpret La Passione&apos;s difference in production values as a shortcoming, however I think they only serve to make the movie feel more personal and unique, which is all the better for it.\n\nShirley Bassey was a fantastic choice for her role in this movie. She looks and sounds as amazing as ever. She is evidently getting even better with age as only the truly great musicians and artists do.\n\nMy only disappointment is that this movie appears still to have never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray. I would love the opportunity to buy and watch La Passione again without the significant image and sound quality loss inherent with VHS.",

      "description": "FAREWELL TO THE FROGS is a portrait of the late filmmaker Ulrich Schamoni (Â† 1998) by his daughter, the renowned photographer Ulrike Schamoni, adapted from her fatherÂ’s film diaries.\r\nSuffering from terminal leukemia, Ulrich Schamoni filmed his life up until only a few days before his death in March 1998. A total of 170 hours of uncut, unedited film diary were recorded on mini-DV material.\r\nWorking with the diaries as well as excerpts from his oeuvre and biographical documents, Director Ulrike Schamoni and editor Grete Jentzen created a 92-minute documentary dedicated to the goal of preserving the legacy of this great filmmaker. SchamoniÂ’s farewell is a powerful, touching chronicle that bears witness, despite his illness, to the full extent of his vigor and love of life. In a mercilessly realistic presentation, it portrays the man who confronted the challenges and the tragic effects of his terminal illness with creativity and a very personal brand of laconic humor. It is a film about a strong attitude toward life and thus also an appeal to love it and live it to the fullest Â– to the very end.\r\nThe film diary and Ulrich SchamoniÂ’s films are closely interwoven. He shot three films at his house in Berlin-Grunewald, often playing the lead role himself. In a certain sense, the film diary is a kind of real-life sequel to his film CHAPEAU CLAQUE (1974, with Rolf Zacher, Karl Dall et al).\r\nThus with its combination of personal insights and film clips from SchamoniÂ’s oeuvre, such as ES (1966, with Sabine Sinjen, Bruno Dietrich et al), FAREWELL TO THE FROGS is both a collage and a historical documentary about a leading exponent of the New German Cinema who played an instrumental role in the development of the German film as a writer-director.",

      "reviewBody": "THE DEEP END / (2001) *** (out of four)\n\n By Blake French:\n\n Lake Tahoe, the tenth deepest lake in the world, is a long, cold body of clear, turquoise water thriving at 6,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Isolated by snow-covered mountain tops, ponderosa pines, and upper class wood homes, this is the perfect backdrop for The Deep End.\n\nThe Deep End captures some of this harrowing atmosphere, but I wanted even more. The photography, by Giles Nuttgens, won the coveted Best Cinematography Award at the Sundance Film Festival this year for its unflinching look at images of Lake Tahoe awash in moral tensions. The camera cuts through aquariums, dripping water faucets, bursting water bottles, and of course, across and beneath the lake&apos;s surface. On a photographic level, this is one great movie.\n\nWriters/directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel found their inspiration for The Deep End from the little known 1940&apos;s novel The Blank Wall by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding. The Ladies Home Journal first published an abridged version of the story. It became so popular that the writer eventually made it into a novel. According to the film&apos;s press notes, even Alfred Hitchcook was impressed as evident when he chose the book for his classic anthology My Favorites in Suspense-1959. Holding&apos;s novel was the only full length feature book of fiction included on that list. \n\nMcGehee and Siegel previously worked on the independent film Suture. &quot;In their day, stories like these were very subversive because they asked questions about the nature of families, about the limits of communication, and the loneliness of personal sacrifice,&quot; says Siegel of Holding&apos;s story. &quot;We wanted to bring those same elements in a contemporary setting with characters that would be sympathetic and believable to people today.&quot;\n\nHolding certainly did have an innate understanding that true suspense emerges not just from violence and mystery, but also from the fabric of everyday life. The Deep End examines a housewife named Margaret (Tilda Swinton) who protects her gay teenage son (Jonathan Tucker) by covering up the death of his lover (Josh Lucas). Did her son kill this person? Someone might know the truth behind this act of violence, but silence has a very high price tag. \n\nA very involving introduction and first act suffer after the diabolical murder plot takes a downhill spiral into a different set of events. Alek Spera (Gordan Visnijc), who needs money for his boss (Raymond J. Berry), creates a blackmail scheme. The film goes downhill from here, but the overall product is far from boring. \n\nThat&apos;s largely because of the beautiful performances. Tilda Swinton, seen opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in 1999&apos;s The Beach, leads the cast with a powerhouse performance. Swinton paints a vivid, intriguing portrait of domestic serenity, peaceful ordinariness, and motherhood&apos;s merciful nature. She can move the audience with utter silence; her eyes exclude intelligence, instinct, and compassion. She completes what the movie leaves unfinished, including her character&apos;s adherence to routine and complete loss of moral compass. \n\nGordon Visnjic (Dr. Luka Kovac on &quot;ER.&quot;) with his dark, brooding physique, creates a shadowy nature for his character. His motives remain a mystery; we never know why he does what he does. It lets the audience guess-but we do not have much to guess with. The film does not complete his character. He&apos;s one of the most interesting characters here, but Visnjic needs more to chew on. \n\nThe filmmakers comment about the hidden romantic feelings between Margaret and Alek. &quot;It&apos;s the kind of romance I miss in movies. It&apos;s not explicit and it is not necessarily even realized, but it is there in a haunting, melancholic way,&quot; says Visnjic. Where? We never really grasp these potentially fascinating plot points because the movie never examines these emotions. This is the kind of material that would have taken The Deep End to another level of interest.",

Although the film is far from perfect it is swollen personality and charisma. At points, it&apos;s down right hilarious. It breathes life into an almost dead genre of film. I like the way it hops back and fourth between the legendary concert and now historic Black Album studio sessions. Also, I&apos;ve never heard a concert film sound that good ever! I thought my face was going to melt once Jay-Z took the stage. Fade to Black rewrites the definition of concert film and as time goes on will eventually be called a classic.",

Some work on the special effect can have done there like on the copy spiral Axel jump of Dark Maul. Some dialogue would don&apos;t have made the cut if I was director, some are real bad and definitely need remake.\n\nFor finish I feel at ends I want to see more of this so I don&apos;t know if it because Im a big SW fans who&apos;s influence my view.

      "reviewBody": "Excellent period film, story of survival in the bleak, bleak wilderness. Richard Harris plays a fur trapper in 1820s America who is left for dead by his expedition party after surviving a bear attack. Harris (amazingly) manages to keep himself alive and catch up with the hunting party. Minimal dialogue and action. More a mood piece than anything else, but a very effective one.\n\nI really enjoyed &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot;. It&apos;s fairly obscure, and its easy to see why. It basically presents nature as hellish and threatening in every way. It also (wonder of wonders) presents the situation realistically. Most films that take place in the 1800s look terrifically groomed and contemporary, as if the stars had spent the day filming and the night relaxing in a jacuzzi. Not so here. This is grimy and gritty. Lots of gray and black and brown. Harris looks dirty and beat-up. I love it.\n\nI also love all the scenes of the expedition members pulling that big, muddy boat all over creation.\n\nA really good film. Highly recommended if you like films that attempt a certain realism - like robert altman&apos;s &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David Fox (Luke Wilson) are returning from an arduous family reunion, on their way to Los Angeles. On their trip they encounter car problems and inevitably pull into a motel Norman Bates could feel right at home at. After some awkward exchanges with the owner, they reluctantly decide to spend the night. Upon viewing some tasteless horror films in the room, David begins to suspect their authenticity, and that these are actual murders taking place. Furthermore, he is led to believe the room that these events take place in is none other than the room they are currently residing. With this initial set-up, Vacancy wastes no time launching the audience into an engaging, gripping, and somewhat macabre story while borrowing sparingly from Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Psycho and managing to side step many land mines other horror films fail to see. \n\nVacancy has both positives and negatives going for it, however the negatives don&apos;t seem to affect the narrative as frequently as in other films. The first thought that came to my mind was its running time. At eighty five minutes, the film may move at too brisk of a pace for some, and at times it feels like it should be part of a short horror film festival, rather than a stand alone feature film. The clichés are very apparent as well-the broken-down car, the mysterious stranger, the out-of-range cell-phone, and the creepy hotel are included, but rather than using them as a crutch for a poor script, the film seems to celebrate their existence. It epitomizes all horror films where the main characters are stranded, encounter mysterious people or creepy locations. The film also fails to successfully flush out the &quot;snuff&quot; film aspect that was so heavily advertised and anticipated. The screen time of these films is very limited and the focus on them is brief. They serve as an fundamental set-up, but after their initial appearance, they fall out of sight and out of mind.\n\nWhat makes the film much more successful than the average &quot;teen slasher&quot; horror film is, ironically, the absence of teens in the film. In recent years the most successful horror films, in my opinion, like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, Stir of Echoes, and Hide and Seek all revolve around families, and in particular, the relationships between adults. In Vacancy, Amy and David are a married couple one argument away from a divorce and unlike an amorous, oblivious, teenage couple about to become mincemeat for an axe-murderer, the tension between David and Amy puts them on edge throughout the whole film and translates to tension in the audience while the film builds its suspense. The build of the film also differs from the main pattern set by modern &quot;slasher&quot; films. Winding like a key, the tension never lets down, and unlike the ups and downs of &quot;slasher&quot; films where there are multiple apexes of horror, there is a ratchet effect in Vacancy, where there is no relief and each scene is built upon the previous one. The other very obvious asset to the film is its relative lack of violence compared to most other modern horror films. In recent years, films such as the Saw series, Hostel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hills Have Eyes have lazily resorted to the shock factor to scare their audience rather than rely on the old saying &quot;It&apos;s not the bang that is scary, but rather, the anticipation to the bang.&quot; That&apos;s not to say that the film isn&apos;t violent free, there is some definite violence involved, but in comparison to other films it seems, dare I say, minimal or practical.\n\nThe references to Hitchcock&apos;s Psycho are refreshingly flattering rather than annoying. In Disturbia, a recent loose remake of Hitchcock&apos;s Rear Window, the similarities become annoying and the film loses its intrigue. In Vacancy, the nods to Psycho are very slight. The Pinewood Motel itself is the most obvious example which, like the Bates Motel, is in serious need of redecorating. The beginning credits also throw back to Psycho with its vertical bars violently moving around to forceful string instruments. There are similar references to Halloween as well, but the one thing the film lacks is the characters&apos; emotional dilemma and their feelings of guilt involved in their situation. In Psycho it is Marion&apos;s (Janet Leigh) moral dilemma over stealing the money, and in Halloween it is Laurie&apos;s (Jamie Lee Curtis) feelings of social inequity. Amy and David do not share this external baggage-their troubled relationship is seemingly repaired through this trial that they are put through and not manifested by a killer such as Michael Myers or Norman Bates. There is no name given to whoever pursues them and there is no correlation that can be drawn between the characters and their tormentors. \n\nAll in all Vacancy hits a few high points and is a smart enough film to stay clear of areas where previous horror movies have failed (horrible twist endings such as in Identity). Vacancy has a decent build of suspense, the exclusion of gratuitous violence helps, and the characters are more likable than those of the average horror movie. The letdown is that the film doesn&apos;t take any substantial risks. It follows a very linear path, with no deviations, and stays almost exclusively at the motel. It is a film that will entertain, but won&apos;t allow for too much out of the box thinking.",

      "reviewBody": "Firstly, let me declare an interest: I&apos;ve been following Rolfe and The Angry Video Game Nerd since about 2007. I&apos;ve bought his DVDs (mainly to contribute to his finances - since 90% of the content is available free online) and I regularly visit his website, Cinemassacre. His short videos are always a joy. They&apos;re informative and humorous, poking fun at the weird curiosities of video-games, board games, movies, TV shows and books. \n\nHowever, when I heard about an AVGN movie, I was a little puzzled. How could that ever work? \n\nThe main problem is that The Nerd isn&apos;t really a true &quot;character&quot; as such, he&apos;s merely an exaggeration of James Rolfe&apos;s personality. Sure, the white shirt is a costume and the love of Rolling Rock is a vague attempt at character detail, but his main characteristic; the anger for awful games - well, that normally comes from embellished truth. This is why the most successful AVGN videos focus on the games that Rolfe has a true history with. Exposing the absurdities of 2003&apos;s &quot;Big Rigs Over the Road Racing&quot; (the subject matter of a recent episode) is a lot of fun, but it pales in comparison to The Nerd spitting bile at &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;; a game which Rolfe hated as a child of the eighties and detests even more, decades later. \n\nNevertheless, The Nerd had built up a loyal army of fan and Rolfe had a guaranteed audience for a movie; irrespective of whether the format truly lent itself to one. \n\nSo, with format tinkering needed, where to go for the movie? The obvious answer would have been a small-scale character-based comedy. Explore and expand The Nerd; turn him into an actual character and, as a result,illustrate why he&apos;s deserving of a self-titled movie. \n\nUnfortunately (and I take no pleasure in that term), Rolfe has always had desires to dream a little &quot;bigger&quot;. Numerous episodes of AVGN and Board James have taken pretty radical deviations after the &quot;reviews&quot; have concluded. Viewers have been treated to bizarre story-lines with budget-stretching special effects, miniatures and fight-sequences. These have, for the most part, been fun - even if they weren&apos;t really the reason why Rolfe had been embraced so enthusiastically by the web community. \n\nIt are these episodes from which AVGN - THE MOVIE, takes its cues. Rolfe and co-director/co-writer Kevin Finn have delivered an unashamedly hokey B-Movie with an outlandish, wacky plot. There&apos;s no deep delving into the Nerd&apos;s character and the only &quot;development&quot; he goes through is overcoming a reluctance to do something incredibly minor. And if you&apos;re expecting more depth to Rolfe&apos;s performance, then you will be disappointed. I lost track of the number of times his reaction to something was simply a lip-pursing frown and a shake of the head. \n\nThere&apos;s also not a huge amount of comedy here. There are comic set-pieces, sure - but the intention seems to be that you will laugh at the sheer nonsense of scenes, rather than specifically funny dialogue. The closest I got to laughing was a bemused smile towards a couple of moments. And that&apos;s the biggest shame; I&apos;d overlook the fact that this is a misguided format for AVGN : The Movie...if the resulting product had generated some decent laughs.\n\nThe plot is that a Games Company have developed a sequel to the infamous ET (or &quot;Eee Tee&quot; as it is here) and want the Nerd to review it, thus publicising it for them. This would have been the perfect springboard for a &quot;Wayne&apos;s World&quot; type story, with our protagonist being exploited by a large corporation. Alas, Finn and Rolfe seem to lose interest in this plot line...which is why we end up with a finale consisting of a chatty alien, a shiny spaceship and a giant existence-threatening monster. \n\nRolfe is accompanied by a surprisingly large cast. Most of the performers do what they can with the material but there isn&apos;t really much depth to the proceedings, so much of them are essentially cardboard cutouts. &quot;Nerdy Sidekick&quot;, &quot;Zany alien&quot;, &quot;War-hungry General&quot;. I get that this is kind of The Point - but there needs to be more to &quot;spoof&quot; than purely pointing out that you know your way around clichés and conventions. \n\nIt&apos;s a little ironic that, by attempting to make the scale of this movie bigger, they end up showing the production up as far more amateurish. It seems that Finn and Rolfe dreamed a little too big in the scripting stage and, rather than reign things in with knowledge of budgeting, they simply kept things exactly as they were as they entered production. The result of this is that we get a huge amount of green-screen, miniatures and rubber suits. Yes, there&apos;s a charm to it (and Rolfe, as a big fan of Godzilla is obviously paying tributes), but it does make this seem more like the web sketch it came from, than the &quot;Movie&quot; it yearns to be. \n\nI should stress that I didn&apos;t dislike AVGN : The Movie. It&apos;s far too long (shave off 40 minutes and it would be far tighter) and I was a little distracted during the sagging second third, but it&apos;s always watchable. It&apos;s certainly more entertaining than the output of The Asylum, with which it shares a similar &quot;look&quot;. \n\nAnd yet, I feel this is a missed opportunity. It&apos;s disappointing that Rolfe and Finn were so focused on pastiching monster movies and capers, rather than creating a movie as original as the web series that inspired it.\n\nI leave you with the fact that Kevin Smith made his debut movie Clerks for less than $30,000. James Rolfe and Kevin Finn had 10 times that amount and made Angry Video Game Nerd : The Movie.",

      "reviewBody": "As a sequel to &quot;Slime City&quot; this movie incorporates much of the same characteristic of its predecessor which was made 22 years earlier. In this particular film a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; has radiated a portion of New York City and the only people to be found there are mutants and refugees of one kind or another. As it so happens four of these people come across some secret bottles of elixir made by a secret cult in 1959 which changes them into zombie-like creatures with an urge to kill. Now, rather than reveal any more of this film I will just say that this was an extremely low-budget production which suffers from that very fact as the acting, script and special effects were all bad. However, the concept behind the movie was quite good and the movie had its moments. That said, even though I would never suggest that it was a good movie by any means-or even a mediocre one-I strongly suggest that a person watches the original film prior to this one if for no other reason than to gain some continuity. In any case, while this movie-much like its predecessor--was certainly &quot;different&quot; it was still pretty bad all the same and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",

It takes a mosaic look at a day and night in the lives of a bunch of Quebecois teens. \n\nA true &apos;indie&apos;, this was made on what looks like $5, shot on often grainy video. \n\nThe film is softer and gentler, with more of a sense of humor than &quot;Kids&quot; to which seems to often be compared, due to both it&apos;s subject matter and it&apos;s rough edged, semi-improvisational style. But by covering more characters over it&apos;s short running time we don&apos;t really get to know any of these kids very well, or identify much with them personally. It&apos;s effect is more of accumulation than of specific dramatic moments. And there are times when the film can feel like it&apos;s dealing in (often comic) caricature or stereotypes, rather than specific, real human beings. \n\nYet, by the end I felt a wistful sadness at the trials and tribulations of adolescence, so universal in the end, no matter how much the surface time or location changes.",

      "name": "&quot;A Superb Nonfiction Film&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "Hi; I&apos;m reprinting this review about the original premiere of &apos;BookWars&apos; from the New York Film Critics Circle (by Matt Zoller Seitz for the NY Press) because it totally sums up what this movie is about:\n\nBookwars Directed by Jason Rosette\n\nIn BookWars, a superb nonfiction film by first-time feature director Jason Rosette, books are more than sources of knowledge. They are merchandise that&apos;s appraised, bought and sold. They&apos;re also artifacts, sometimes clean and intact but more often damaged, whose condition at the point of sale says plenty about the conscientiousness of the seller. Most of all, they&apos;re an addictive substance.\n\nRosette, a former street bookseller, makes the point that while his brethren tend to be more educated than the average Joe, and much more aggressive in extolling the virtues of reading, when you get down to it, they&apos;re basically junkies chasing a rush. The specific type of rush varies from bookseller to bookseller: some of Rosette&apos;s subjects get off on the idea of spreading self-empowering knowledge, or belief systems that terrify the establishment; others seem to get a charge out of interacting with customers, whose eccentric ranks include a surprisingly high number of repeat clients; still others sell books because they&apos;ve been doing it for years and can&apos;t imagine any other life. They&apos;re dealers who are hooked on their own merchandise. &quot;When (people) get hold of a good book, they get intoxicated, they get high,&quot; one bookseller tells Rosette.\n\nBookWars has its world premiere March 11, 7:30, at the New York Underground Film Festival, which runs March 8-14 at Anthology Film Archives. It occurs to me that when you check out this festival, the experience is not unlike perusing a street bookseller&apos;s wares. In both cases you get a mix of old and new themes, titles and styles, and the quality of presentation varies wildly from work to work. On the street, some books are shrink-wrapped and new, freshly purchased at some used bookstore or plucked from a remainder bin or a warehouse garbage pile, while others are dog-eared, broken-spined, underlined, highlighted. At the New York Underground Film Festival, you see the same discrepancy in artistry and production values. Some stuff seems utterly polished and accessible, even lushly produced; other stuff is well-done, but made in a stridently kooky or uncompromisingly obtuse style that&apos;s meant to repel casual moviegoers. Other stuff is pure film geek b.s., hewing so close to the cliche of underground filmmaking that it&apos;s tough to watch without snickering. (Remember that incomprehensible experimental movie directed by Shelley Long&apos;s Mensa barmaid on Cheers, which ended with stock footage of a mushroom cloud and the credit, &quot;Un Film de Diane Chambers&quot;? The NYUFF usually has at least three equivalents on the schedule.) But no matter what the quality of the individual items, the event has a pleasing gestalt. So much of moviegoing life is bound up in advertising, media hype and other forms of prepackaging; even most arthouses and film festivals succumb to these forces, showing movies that have played a hundred fests already (or are about to). At NYUFF, you can be reasonably sure that you&apos;re going to see a lot of stuff you&apos;ve never heard of before, much less seen, and that this will probably be your only chance to see it, for better or worse. Like items on a street bookseller&apos;s table, you can probably ignore a lot of it without worrying that you&apos;ve impoverished your spirit. But you also want to be alert and open to possibilities-otherwise you might miss something that will make your day, even change your life.\n\nBookWars is an example of the latter: a real find. It&apos;d fit nicely on a double bill with Wonder Boys. Both films are about people with a hopeless, perhaps self-destructive love of books and words and both exude an unmistakable aura of authority. The filmmakers clearly know what they&apos;re talking about-you sense they&apos;re emotionally committed participants, not tourists-and they manage to make a peculiar literary subculture accessible to casual viewers without condescending to the people involved or dumbing anything down. Most significantly, both films convey the sense of a fragile, fascinating world endangered by shifting cultural values. The chatty literati of Wonder Boys are creatures of the university system, which until recently shielded them from the hard truths of declining American literacy and the rise of mass-market values in the publishing industry. They&apos;re finding out the hard way that they can run but they can&apos;t hide, and that very soon, serious literary fiction will be as relevant to the general public as blacksmithing.\n\nIn BookWars, Giuliani&apos;s quality-of-life campaign-which sometimes seems to stem more from a desire to protect big business and control or destroy oddball fringe New Yorkers than to legitimately enhance public safety-decimates the ranks of street booksellers, whose interaction with citizens in America&apos;s most literate city once was evidence of a thriving urban life of the mind. Rosette, who started selling books on the street in the mid-90s, is aware that he came in at the end of an era, but he doesn&apos;t let that awareness poison the story with bitterness; nor does he lionize himself for having known interesting people and chronicling the beginning of the end of their world. He&apos;s just a guy selling books, and he happens to have a camera, a point of view and the storytelling chops to explain what happened and what it means.\n\nThe action unfolds mainly in two bookselling hotspots, the Washington Square Park area and on 6th Ave. Near the Jefferson Market library. The diverse cast of characters includes Pete, an artist with a loft in downtown Newark who started buying used books to gather collage material and ended up selling them; Thomas from California, a slender, bearded fellow who unexpectedly becomes a fierce community organizer when Giuliani&apos;s minions begin their crackdown; and Rick, a young, droll, part-time street magician and friend of Rosette who came into the bookselling game even later than the filmmaker. There are guys from Russia and Poland and Jamaica, young slacker types and men who look old enough to have actually hung out with the Beats. The customer base is just as varied; as is the case with any business, the booksellers make a sizable chunk of revenue off repeat customers, some of whom are charming, others aloof and even belligerent.\n\nLike a good, long, thorough magazine article, BookWars has a controlled, mesmerizing tone and an eye for small, telling details. Contrary to irresponsible stories published in various New York newspapers and magazines, Rosette informs us that most street booksellers don&apos;t steal their books; they get most of their wares from yard and estate sales in the city and surrounding suburbs, as well as from remainder bins and trash heaps. They fix up the more battered volumes using the standard bookseller&apos;s tool kit (tape, Elmer&apos;s Glue, rubbing alcohol, razor blades) and add little psychologically effective touches to make certain books seem more special (plastic slipcovers, for example). The books are stored in the sellers&apos; homes or in storage lockers (very few booksellers are homeless), and the storage unit of choice is a cardboard banana box, usually Del Monte (nobody knows why; it&apos;s just tradition).\n\nThe booksellers are fascinating underground characters-little Joe Goulds-but Rosette doesn&apos;t suggest that they&apos;re all wonderful, highly functioning people who&apos;d fit in any place if given the chance. On the contrary, some of them seem cranky, unreasonable, even mentally disturbed; at the very least, we sense that most of them would never be as driven and together in another profession as they are in this one. Where books are concerned, they seem to feel criticisms and slights more deeply than most citizens.\n\nBecause we&apos;re given a bit of time to know the booksellers, the encroachment on their lifestyle by cops, bureaucrats and college administrators (NYU installed huge sidewalk planters to make it harder to set up tables) seems an outrageous overreaction to people who, in the greater scheme of social ills, could not rationally be considered a serious problem. Rosette astutely shows us how Giuliani&apos;s forces gradually turned up the heat, ticketing the sellers for not having proper documentation, instituting curfews, even subtly drawing and redrawing lines on the curb so that the space booksellers could occupy was reduced over time. The film metaphorically links Giuliani&apos;s meticulous persecution of street booksellers to the fate of a toad in one of Pete the artist&apos;s terrariums. The puny amphibian mysteriously took ill and died, and Pete later discovered from reading a natural history book that the animal probably cacked from infestation after a fly laid maggot eggs in its stomach. Late in the film, as the city closes in, Rosette&apos;s narration brings this chilling image home. &quot;What is this thing that seeks to regiment, control, organize and commodify everything in its path, this thing that cleans the streets, this devouring worm that eats cities from the inside out?&quot; he asks.\n\nThough Rosette is the main character in BookWars and our guide through its world, he doesn&apos;t aggrandize himself or put his own feelings front and center. He&apos;s content to serve as an engaged yet slightly distanced narrator. His pitch-perfect sense of what shots to show us and how long to fix them onscreen, coupled with his sharp choice of music and his relaxed yet elegant narration (his Ohio-accented tenor speaking voice suggests Lou Reed&apos;s vocals) hints at a potentially fearsome combination of literary ambition and film sense. In its own laid-back, no-big-deal way, this is a wonderful movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Kind of a strange movie but very original and entertaining! It was a Gothic-romance period-piece drama-mystery, and quirky characters and a bizarre--or at least unusual--plot held my interest. \n\nEdward Norton&apos;s character plays an inscrutable but romantic master illusionist. But is he just a master illusionist or has he developed powers to effect the creepy conjuring of those who have passed on? (Regardless, the guy is so easy on the eyes.)\n\nJessica Biel is beautiful and good in her role but I couldn&apos;t help thinking, &quot;Hey, Jessica, Scarlett Johanssen called. She wants her lips back.&quot; \n\nPaul Giamatti bothered me just a tad at first because he spoke in a near-whisper and had a scruffy beard so you couldn&apos;t read his lips. He got louder and his character developed pretty darned well, thank goodness. Actually, he was fantastic (so what else is new?). \n\nThe makers of this movie did the same thing the makers of Little Miss Sunshine did--made me want to see the film twice, but for different reasons: LMS because the first time I saw it, I laughed so hard I cried, and I really needed a laugh again (and got it); The Illusionist because I was like the audience for the title character&apos;s shows the first time I saw it--just kind of naive and awed and staring up at the action with my mouth hanging open. So I&apos;ll have to see it again and pay attention. Kind of like when my daughter told me to go see The Sixth Sense again and pay attention to what Bruce Willis&apos;s character was wearing. (Plot-wise, this is unrelated, folks--just a movie watcher&apos;s analogy.)\n\nAt first, the old-fashioned circle wipes seemed a little distracting, but in retrospect, they were part of the excellent movie-making decisions that created the illusion of time and place in this film. A really good story with really good art direction and really good actors, costumes and settings. Definitely worth a go-see--or two!",

Rock has been able to elivate films with his outstanding supporting roles including them in New Jack City, Dogma and Nurse Betty (Betty and Dogma actually getting such a boost by him they got in my top ten lists), but here, he is brought on the second time in a starring role. While he is slightly funnier here than in CB4, he isn&apos;t as good as he could&apos;ve been.  \n\nWhat Rock stars in is a remake of a remake that is probably from a play and that might also be a flaw.  Rock and his staff of writers (ie Chris Rock show) do what they can with they&apos;re script about a flawful comedian named Lance who gets sent up to heaven to early and is sent back in a body for a short while, except the body is white.  While many of the scenes with Rock as Lance inside the old white guy aren&apos;t laugh out loud funny, they are interesting for me being a Chris Rock fan (seeing a man like the one Chris gets himself into telling his famous Black Mall skit had me thinking while laughing).  Not always on the money, to say the least, but it isn&apos;t a waste of total time.  B",

      "reviewBody": "Some stunning Technicolor photography of African footage and beautiful AVA GARDNER are the sole reasons for watching John Ford&apos;s MOGAMBO, a remake of &quot;Red Dust&quot; that starred Jean Harlow twenty years before this was made.\n\nHarlow&apos;s co-star, CLARK GABLE, is back reprising his role as the great white hunter (what happened to STEWART GRANGER???), but Gable has mellowed quite a bit and looks a bit too tired to be the love interest of both AVA GARDNER and GRACE KELLY--which is what the plot really boils down to. However, he is more than able to tame both of them.\n\nGRACE KELLY still has the affected way of reciting her lines in a prim and princess-like way and is the less interesting of the two females. AVA GARDNER, on the other hand, livens up the story with her sarcastic one-liners and her ability to size up any situation and call a spade a spade. She&apos;s honest, frank and completely charming in her own way and walks off with every scene she&apos;s in, fully deserving her sole Oscar nomination.\n\nBut if you&apos;re looking for a real good story, MOGAMBO is not it. It has all the realism of a picture postcard despite the fact that much of it was filmed in colorful Africa. But the use of stock footage is also apparent as are shots of Gable and others before a process screen.\n\nFans of the stars should enjoy this one, but be warned--it&apos;s not without some serious flaws, mostly due to a weak script.",

      "reviewBody": "In spite of the ridiculous, cucumber alien monster (which is fortunatedly kept off-screen through most of the film) this is actually an intelligent science-fiction thriller that&apos;s very much in an OUTER LIMITS vein.\n\nMisanthropic scientist Lee Van Cleef makes contact with a being from Venus who promises to save mankind from his own self-destruction.  Cleef paves the way for the alien to come to Earth, where it hides out in a hot springs cave outside of a small, remote Southern Californian town.  Upon arriving, the being (or should I say invader) proves to have sinister plans of its own.\n\nThis early Corman quickie is quite good as long as you&apos;re not evaluating it based by today&apos;s high-tech standards.  It&apos;s naive and unsportmanslike to condemn a film just because it was made decades before CGI was even invented.\n\nThe film has a certain disquieting mood about it.  The remote setting adds to the sense of paranoia and isolation, and though the plot is sometimes critizied as being awkward, that tells me that the critic may be a short attention span member.  You need to put some brainwork into your film viewing if you wish to gain any savory qualities from it.  Whining because a planet isn&apos;t exploding every other minute is very superficial, and true science-fiction isn&apos;t for the shallow non-thinker who only has instant, immediate gratification on his non-mind.\n\nA subtle sense of terror builds throughout (similar to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS) as nearly the entire cast meet unspeakable fates.  The story carrys a pertinent cautionary message:  Blind devotion to a utopian ideal can lead to the worst kind of disillusionment and tragedy.  History has taught us that many times over.  Science-fiction is meant to be provocative and not just shallow, forgettable entertainment.\n\nSure, if this film had a higher budget, and perhaps a little more script polishing, it could have been one of the top fifties science-fiction films. As it is, it&apos;s interesting with intriguing possibilities, and as long as YOU haven&apos;t been taken over by high-tech effects and sales hype, you may find it worth taking a look at."

Did you know the dream sequences to the song &quot;I used to be color blind&quot; were originally filmed in color but the release abandoned because RKO couldn&apos;t get the tech specs right and the cost was going to be too high for the budget already set. It was a great idea and today might have made CAREFREE a more enduring success as there is no color footage of them as a dancing pair until 1949 at MGM.. Apart from the snazzy look of the art direction, Ginger&apos;s fantastic &apos;hearts and arrows&apos; outfit and big black bewitching hat and the RKO world of the stone and timber country club, the music here is just terrific. The swing antics of the golf club bagpipe sequence had one audience I saw it with in rapturous applause. But I defy anyone to stay seated during THE YAM as they wing and swing their way all over the BIG SET Country club. CAREFREE is just great."

What indeed DOES happen to a dream deferred?  Each of the adult main characters has a dream about what should be done with the $10,000 insurance policy paid after the Younger patriarch&apos;s death, and each person&apos;s dream is challenged.  I most identify with the character of Beneatha, the doctor-to-be in a time when few women, and even fewer Black women, could achieve this dream. This is a story of dreams, of family, of strength, of sacrifice, of mistakes and of recovery from the consequences of those mistakes.  Whenever I need a dose of inspiration, when things in my own life seem too difficult to conquer, I watch A Raisin in the Sun and feel strong again.  The acting in this film is so incredibly moving that there are parts (and I won&apos;t give them away) that are so disheartening and sad that they still move me to tears, after all these years and after all the times I have watched it.  It is truly the greatest story ever told."

      "reviewBody": "Body of Evidence: 7 out of 10: A woman is on trial for seducing men to death. Will her lawyer get her off? Will she get him off? Stay tuned for the drama both inside and outside of the courtroom.\n\nThe case for the Prosecution:\n\nExhibit A: The courtroom scenes: AKA half the bloody movie. Body of Evidence is often considered an erotic thriller. However, it spends an amazing amount of time in the courtroom. Now courtroom scenes can work in thrillers (see 1990&apos;s Presumed Innocent), but they should be to the point and thrilling. The scenes here are pointless with half a dozen side characters introduced and then forgotten. It never feels like a real trial. The judge allows so many shenanigans that she makes Judge Ito look like Judge Judy.\n\nExhibit B: William Defoe: I genuinely like William Defoe. But as the lead character in an erotic thriller? As Weird Al Yankovic wrote about Mr. Defoe in his song &quot;Ode To A Superhero&quot;\n\n And he&apos;s ridin&apos; around on that glider thing And he&apos;s throwin&apos; that weird pumpkin bomb Yes, he&apos;s wearin&apos; that dumb Power Rangers mask But he&apos;s scarier without it on\n\nNow If William Defoe switched roles with Joe Mantegna as the prosecutor that might have worked a lot better. Both are wonderful charismatic actors but nobody wants to see William Defoe&apos;s O face.\n\nExhibit C: Madonna: Madonna makes bad movies. This is a Madonna movie. Hence this is a bad movie. Prosecution rests.\n\n The prosecution is feeling a bit overconfident there and rested their case without mentioning Anne Archer&apos;s performance or the horrifying screenplay.\n\nThe Defense:\n\nExhibit A: Madonna: In 1992 naked Madonna was everywhere. People were buying $50 coffee books that consisted if nothing but pictures of her naked while hitchhiking. (This is true ask your cool aunt). As Rosie O&apos;Donnell said to her in A League of Their Own. &quot;You think there are men in this country who ain&apos;t seen your bosoms?&quot; What a difference twenty-six years makes. We are not inundated with Madonna nowadays (naked or otherwise) so she seems fresh again. Also, she really isn&apos;t bad in this movie considering the lines she is given. She certainly gives a better performance than Anne Archer.\n\nExhibit B: Erotic Thrillers: Erotic thrillers enjoyed a moment between Basic Instinct and Showgirls. We really don&apos;t see them like these anymore and haven&apos;t for a long time. There were a lot of them in that time period (Heck there were two with Billy Baldwin for God&apos;s sake) So we often will revisit the lesser known ones for some nostalgia much like future generations will watch Ant-Man and muse how they don&apos;t make Superhero movies anymore.\n\nExhibit C: That one scene you forgot was in the movie: The defense is wheeling out a TV and DVD player. Looks like they are going to show a clip. The overconfident prosecution doesn&apos;t object. Is that a young naked Julianne Moore? Wow, that sex scene is so intense. Where did that come from and how did Madonna allow herself to be upstaged.\n\nThe Verdict: In 2018 the defense wins. Time has been kind to this movie. I certainly understand the panning this received when it hit the local cineplex in 1992. For one thing, Madonna and Julianne Moore fighting over William Defoe sounds like a mental patient&apos;s fan fiction. For another, this is a Netflix and chill movie, not something you want to see in a theater filled with suburban housewives and Paul Reubens. It is both as bad as you remember it but somehow endlessly entertaining.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;I Am Walking Along Moscow&quot; aka &quot;Ya Shagayu Po Moskve&quot; (1963) is a charming lyrical comedy directed by Georgi Daneliya in 1963 that was nominated for Golden Palm at Cannes Film Festival. Daneliya proved that it is possible to create a masterpiece in the most difficult genre of romantic comedy. Made by the team of young and incredibly talented artists that besides Daneliya included writer/poet Gennady Shpalikov, composer Andrei Petrov, and cinematographer Vadim Yusov (who had made four films with Andrei Tarkovski), and the dream cast of the talented actors even in the smaller cameos, &quot;I Am Walking Along Moscow&quot; keeps walking victoriously through the decades remaining deservingly one of the best and most beloved Russian comedies and simply one of the best Russian movies ever made. Funny and gentle, dreamy and humorous, romantic and realistic, the film is blessed with the eternal youth and will always take to the walk on the streets of Moscow new generations of the grateful viewers.\n\nI would place it on the same level as Fellini&apos;s Roma or Woody&apos;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; - yes, I think it is that good and I see it as the love letter to the magnificent city on the Moskva River which used to by My city, too. It is about spring in Moscow of 1963, (in more ways than one), about youth, first love, smiles, sudden meetings and inevitable goodbyes. It takes place on the streets of Moscow, in its parks, subway stations, and movie theaters. It follows the &quot;Moskvichi&quot; and the guests of the city, young and middle-aged, romantic and tired, friendly and suspicious, happy and disappointed, wise and naive in the series of short vignettes and it introduces us to the characters whom we get to meet, to like, and to follow on their journey in the course of one long sunny rainy spring day.",

Tom&apos;s portrayal of the plight of animals after Katrina was bare-boned and showed us the painful reality of how things really were. We saw only a small piece of the aftermath, I can only imagine what it would be like to see the whole picture. Unless a person has experienced this kind of trauma, they cannot know what toll it takes on the mind and how it changes our perception of things and in that, changes the decisions we make. Tom did a wonderful job producing this film. It was moving and elicited many emotional responses in a very short period of time. People need to see this.",

Gracie did two more guest star appearances in film while George would wait over 30 years to go back in The Sunshine Boys which netted him an Oscar. Oddly enough their characters do not have any scenes together until the very end of the movie, almost as if they were trying their separate wings.\n\nHonolulu was the start of a winding down of a vogue for south seas movies that started over at Paramount with Dorothy Lamour and her sarong and with Bing Crosby&apos;s Waikiki Wedding celebrating a trip to Hawaii Bing took in real life. MGM wasn&apos;t going to let Paramount get all the tropical box office.\n\nRobert Young plays a dual role as both a movie star and a visiting planter from Hawaii. Young trying to escape the constant demands of his adoring public offers to switch places with his lookalike. But he gets into all kinds of complications on the ship to Hawaii when he meets Eleanor Powell on board. He falls for her, but the planter, now miserably cooped up in his hotel room because he can&apos;t get out in public is engaged to Rita Johnson, daughter of another planter Clarence Kolb back on Oahu.\n\nLet&apos;s just say that with two Robert Youngs there was enough to go around by the time Honolulu was over with a few bumps along the way.\n\nNo memorable songs came out of Honolulu, but Eleanor Powell had some great numbers including a hula tap dance. She seems to have invented her own dance genre because I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before or since. The production values are also a little skimpy for an MGM musical. \n\nBut with Eleanor dancing and George and Gracie doing their thing Honolulu holds up very nicely for over 70 years.",

      "reviewBody": "I couldn&apos;t believe that some of these film&apos;s reviews are as new as 2010!! I saw this movie as a child (so long ago!) and never forgot it.\n\n&quot;La Mangano&quot; (The stress goes on the first A: Mángano), at that time made a big hit here in Argentina, as did some other Italian beauties, like Silvana Pampanini and Gina Lollobrigida. \n\nThey were living LEGENDS.\n\n&quot;Bitter Rice&quot; (&quot;Riso amaro&quot;) shows Silvana Mangano as an incredibly sexy woman (same in this film, &quot;Anna&quot;) and the baion she dances in one scene made history. \n\nThe love scenes between her and Vittorio Gasman are breathtaking, because both actors where terribly sexy. \n\nAt that time these movies were VERY osé, almost pornographic (they are so mild by comparison with what we see today...). \n\nIt&apos;s true what another reviewer says: &quot;Only Rita Hayworth made such an impression when doing &quot;Amado mio&quot; and &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot; in &quot;Gilda&quot;. \n\nNobody could get that feeling on film nowadays. As Gloria Swanson character puts it in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;: &quot;We had faces then&quot; (She meant in the silent era), but these Italian stars had faces AND BODIES to match!!\n\nAbout Silvana Mangano, it&apos;s incredible the way this actress refined her looks after a while. Seeing her in &quot;Morte a Venezia&quot; (&quot;Death in Venice&quot;), by Visconti --1971--, where she plays Tadzio&apos;s mother, an extremely refined polish countess, it&apos;s almost impossible to associate her with the voluptuos woman in &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Bitter Rice&quot;. \n\nHer polished looks are even more glorious than when she was a sex bomb.\n\nSame thing in &quot;Gruppo di famiglia in un interno&quot; --1974-- again by Visconti, with Burt Lancaster.\n\nA true star that unfortunately had such a sad ending, but then, as Dorothy Parker put it when defending before Louis B. Mayer her bitter ending scripts: &quot;Mr. Mayer, in real life there are no happy endings&quot;.\n\nSilvana Mangano&apos;s was no exception.",

      "reviewBody": "At first glance you&apos;d never guess the same director who did the wonderfully charming &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; would turn around 2 years later and do the dark, dystopian chiller &quot;Rollerball&quot;. But he did.\n\nBut in both films, we see the same powerful strategy: a complex, philosophical brain-twister beneath a deceptivly simple exterior. &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; was seemingly a linear story about a struggling Jewish family&apos;s good &amp; bad times. But the real meat of the story was about the conflict between old ways and new (tradition vs. progress). Here in &quot;Rollerball&quot; we have another seemingly linear story about an athlete in a violent, futuristic sport. But the real meat is the conflict of brutal human nature vs. suppression (again, a sort of &quot;tradition vs. progress&quot;). As with &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, director Norm Jewison doesn&apos;t hit us over the head with any preachy sermon but instead leaves us to digest the situation.\n\n&quot;Rollerball&quot; has the same powerful, brooding quality that we see in many of the 70s scifi masterpieces, like &quot;THX 1138&quot;, &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (yeah I know that one was 1982), and the one that started them all, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Cold, sterile sets, disturbing situations and powerful use of silence characterize these films. By today&apos;s standards they might be considered slow, but depending on how you like your scifi, that might be right up your alley.\n\nIn a nutshell, the story is about a futuristic society that has largely done away with civilian violence. It has done this by &quot;subsidizing&quot; violence by way of a global pasttime: a hyper-violent sport called Rollerball. Note: as a parallel story, we learn that cut-throat corporate competition has been similarly squelched by the government creating monopolies. And thus society finds peace. Or does it? You can probably see the brilliant metaphors being woven here. This isn&apos;t an ordinary scifi romp, it&apos;s a powerful socio-political allegory. It cuts to the heart of human nature the way the great writers H.G. Welles, Mary Shelley and George Orwell did. No, you won&apos;t see a lot of laser battles, spaceships and aliens. But here you&apos;ll see an excellent example of what scifi was designed to do: comment on our current human condition by creating a fictional (extreme) scenario as a cautionary tale.\n\nExcellent, and I mean EXCELLENT performances by James Caan (The Godfather, Misery), John Houseman (The Paper Chase, The Fog), Maud Adams (3 James Bond films), Moses Gunn (every 70s TV show from Hawaii 5-O to Shaft), and a particularly gripping performance by Pamela Hensley (Princess Ardala in &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; homina homina) make this an all-star powerhouse of 70s talent.\n\nThe music deserves a special mention of its own. From the opening notes of Bach&apos;s Toccata in Dm (the creepy &quot;Dracula&quot; theme) to Albinoni&apos;s haunting Adagio in Gm (check it out on YouTube... saddest song ever), &quot;Rollerball&quot; doesn&apos;t hold back.\n\nThey don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore. But there are a few modern scifi films that come close: &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;District 9&quot; and &quot;Solaris&quot; come to mind.\n\nIf you liked the films I mentioned in this review; if you liked the 70s classics &quot;Catch-22&quot; and &quot;Coma&quot; and &quot;Stepford Wives&quot;; if you like films that are both entertaining and works of art, do NOT miss Rollerball.\n\nFor laughs, after you watch Rollerball (1976), check out the remake done in 2002 ...and see how far we&apos;ve come :/",

      "reviewBody": "Jungle Jim was Johnny Weismuller&apos;s vehicle after he became too old to play Tarzan, and passed the mantle to younger actors. As Jungle Jim, he stays in his African milieu, dons safari clothes and has a series of numbskull adventures mostly saving ladies in distress. This is the first of the series, in which Jungle Jim helps a lady scientist discover a cure for polio (remember that Jungle Jim is made in 1948 before the discovery of the Salk vaccine). In this, it may be ahead of its time; first having a smart female character, and second, finding cures to disease in tropical plants. The villain is played by the pre-Superman George Reeves.\n\nWhere Jungle Jim is behind the times is its portrayal of Africans, in this case Masai, who look like white people, and the idiotic portrayal of wildlife.  Nonetheless, it&apos;s a laugh. But if you&apos;re looking for something serious pass it by.",

I seriously was expecting this big travesty of a film with the way the users are talking about it on IMDb, but I have to honestly say that it wasn&apos;t THAT bad, come on, it&apos;s a kid&apos;s movie, what did you expect? Citizen Kane? For the kids it had a fun plot and cool visuals, yeah, the story was a little lame, but as adults we should know that this movie was not meant for us, so I am going to judge it on being a children&apos;s movie.\n\nThese kids all have super powers, but don&apos;t know how to use them effectively, so the program of Zoom is going to help them become super heroes with a man who was a former celebrity type of hero who is now a has-been. They enjoy being kids with each other and learn how to use their powers in the right ways and must destroy Conor, another former super hero who went bad. Together they all must learn to a team and also a family.\n\nLike I said, for a kid&apos;s movie, it&apos;s cute and it really wasn&apos;t a BAD movie, I&apos;ve seen worse, believe me! So don&apos;t use most of these comments as your judgment factor, see how the kids react and really judge for yourself, it&apos;s a fun little flick that I wouldn&apos;t watch again, but I think it will be a fun small classic somewhere down the road for the children.\n\n5/10",

      "reviewBody": "Director Pooja Bhatt goes on the lighter side this time with Holiday after her heavy Paap. Holiday is the story of an ugly, clumsy, and unpopular girl frustrated by all her failures and just once wants to make her father proud. Her sister plays the role equivalent to the stereotypical American &quot;blonde ditz,&quot; and might I add, she did a pretty poor job at it. The girl falls in love at sight with Dino, a salsa dance teacher. She gets herself involved in his personal problems with Kashmira Shah. This story had lots of potential such as developing the sister&apos;s relationship with her &quot;boyfriend,&quot; but was sadly left alone. Nonetheless, there were a few good scenes. My favorite is the one where Dino tells the girl to not be crushed by others and lose her identity, or she will just become another face in the crowd, the theme of the movie. This scene takes the movie beyond your typical &quot;ugly duckling&quot; story and gives it much more depth. The protagonist was poorly casted. She gave a poor performance. Dino&apos;s immense efforts in learning salsa and his character clearly showed through the screen. Kashmira was also good. Songs were okay.",

Those alone will give you an idea of what all this movie entails. I like the quality of the film, the aerial shots, the way it was shot, with clear pictures and no obscured views. It didn&apos;t feel awkward, but more like this is what real people do deal with at times in everyday lives. Personally I would not call it a Horror movie, but rather a Thriller with Drama I guess. But that is my opinion. I have been watching a few movies lately that seem to have the same approach of dealing more with no music in the background and I have to say it works. It does take a bit to get used to, but I think that it also gives you a chance to show of the actors talent and let the scene speak for itself. I think the end speaks for itself and some may not like the way it ended or it didn&apos;t make it clear enough. For me it worked. Are there any problems with this movie? Perhaps, but I have no complaints. I liked it and on a day where Hurricane Sandy is barring down on us, it kind of added to the mood! Will I recommend this movie? Absolutely! So go ahead and watch it!",

      "reviewBody": "Early Bergman, and from the onset it is clear an artist is at work. The first conversation piece, with all 5 waiting women in the same room, is a long shot approaching 4 minutes, with various of the women talking. There are also already some typical Bergman postures, with one woman talking intensely and the one next to her staring vapidly past her downwards, seemingly lost in her own inner world. All that in well and good, but as soon as I heard the first monotonous monologue from the mother, her eyes turning to heaven, speaking of how she can not reach out to her husband&quot;, not even to scratch his eyes out, my Bergman-radar immediately hit the red zone. And surely enough, we are in for group therapy all the way, as each woman tells of one significant episode from their lives with their husbands. But it is a very elegant movie, and along the way you become quite sympathetic, even though all the stories describe infidelity and frigid bourgeous lives. My eye was caught by Eva Dahlbeck, who I also recently saw in Sommarnöje sökes. Here, at 32, she is sizzlingly hot. Overall it is a movie not to be missed by Bergman lovers, if mainly for historical reasons. His next movie was Monika, so this one can be said to commence his golden period. For the trivia-consumers: IMDb informs that Eva Dahlbeck has recently filed for divorce, after, ahem, 67 years of marriage. You go, girl!",

      "name": "A highly accurate portrayal of the criminal abuses possible with hypnosis",
      "reviewBody": "Only if you get hold of a copy of the book OPEN TO SUGGESTION (published in Britain in 1989 but suppressed in the USA by the CIA, who told numerous American publishers who were interested in it that it would be against the national interest to publish it) can you appreciate just how accurate this film is. This tensely directed Japanese film, directed by Masayuki Ochiai (who was also one of the three writers), is a rather garish and eerie thriller which becomes somewhat paranormal towards the end. Various people are suddenly committing suicide without explanation, and a police investigation tries to find out why. They all appear to go into a trance just before killing themselves and say that they can &apos;see the green monkey&apos;, so there is clearly a link of some kind, but none of the people appear ever to have met one another, and it is a deep mystery which seems impossible to solve. And who or what the green monkey is no one can figure out either. Eventually it becomes clear that they have all previously been hypnotised and a high-pitched sound has been triggering post-hypnotic revived trance states without warning, resulting in their deaths. As OPEN TO SUGGESTION (which includes a 150 year survey of documented cases of the criminal abuses of hypnosis) makes clear, approximately 5% of the population are what are known among hypnotists as &apos;highly-suggestibles&apos;, or &apos;virtuosos&apos;. They are the ones who can easily be criminally abused by an unscrupulous expert hypnotist. A small minority of these are multiple personality cases. One of the leading characters in this film is a very pretty waif-like girl named Yuka Irie, played by Miho Kanno. As the film evolves, we discover that she is a multiple personality case and that one of her personalities even lives in a different Tokyo flat which is unknown to her main personality. This sort of thing is not at all unusual for a true &apos;multiple&apos;, and such cases have frequently been fully documented. Yuka Irie has been hypnotically abused, and heightening terror arises from this volatile situation, since multiples need to be handled very carefully under hypnosis or disaster can result, as it does here. It is often wrongly believed by the gullible public that &apos;no one can be made to do anything under hypnosis which is against his or her moral principles&apos;. That is complete nonsense. It was a false story circulated by the stage hypnotists (one of which features in this story), and perpetuated by the television hypnotists, to encourage members of the public to come forward for the hypnotic entertainment shows without being apprehensive. Of course, hypnosis in the right hands of responsible people can accomplish near miracles in many ways, such as total suppression of pain, control of haemorrhaging, cure of psoriasis and most skin conditions, cure of phobias such as spider and flying phobias, cure of smoking addictions, and so on. There is also a psychiatric version known as &apos;hypno-therapy&apos;, which has also had excellent results much more quickly than standard psychiatric techniques, but can obviously only be practised by a small specialist minority of trained psychiatrists and not by the normal hypnotist. However, documented cases prove that in criminal hands, highly-suggestibles can be made to rob banks, commit murder, and even commit suicide. The world&apos;s security services use hypnosis to train assassins, and everything in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is pretty accurate, as also in the film TELEFON. It was Hitler&apos;s regime which first made hypnosis a major tool of state. Ferenc Volgyesi, the SS&apos;s master hypnotist, hypnotised more than 60,000 individuals during the Hitler era, and after the War (having originally been contacted and visited in person by the American hypnotist Clark Hull in the late 1930s), he was brought to America, called Frank, given a new life, and helped the American security services to set up their programs using hypnosis, most of which have never been publicly admitted or revealed. However, I do not wish to alarm the security agencies by embarrassing them too much, I merely mention this as historical background. What has happened since 1945 is secret and will unquestionably stay that way. But one fact is certain, namely that more than 50% of all hypnosis experimentation which took place in America after 1945 was done by the FBI, CIA, and other such organisations, was never published, and is still classified as &apos;top secret&apos;. This will never change. I was told this personally by Professor Ernest Hilgard, former President of the American Psychological Association, and founder of the Stanford Hypnosis Lab. (See his classic book DIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS if you really want to understand this film.) The title of this film, SAIMIN, is the Japanese word for &apos;hypnosis&apos;, and the video tape with English subtitles which I have of this film is entitled HYPNOSIS. &apos;Saimin&apos; must be a loan word from Chinese, for the Chinese name for hypnosis is &apos;cui mian&apos;, which is pronounced &apos;tswaymien&apos;, which sounds almost like &apos;saimin&apos;, thus indicating that one is derived from the other. Since I never heard of the Chinese borrowing anything from the Japanese, but the Japanese have borrowed countless things from China over the millennia, including many of their written characters, in my opinion this word must be Chinese in origin. Until I saw this film, I was unaware that there were people in Japan who were so knowledgeable about hypnosis, and especially who would or could advise filmmakers to make a film like this. That in itself is something of an enigma, for those who like enigmas. But meanwhile, anyone who has a serious interest in hypnosis can profit by seeing this remarkably gripping and harrowing tale, though it is pretty scary and over-dramatic. Also, not all girls who run amok under hypnosis are as cute as this one, which all goes to show that movies are movies. No movie wants an ugly crazed, hypnotised girl.",

But there is no one, I mean no one in current Chinese movie actors inventory who can pull this role off. Other movies that portrays the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, cleverly avoids putting any of the monstrously powerful warriors from this story on screen (or relegates them to relatively insignificant role in the story that don&apos;t require them to showcase their terrific might). Maybe if they can find equivalent of Chris Hemsworth when they made the movie &quot;Thor&quot;, movies portraying the heroes of this story will succeed.\n\nThe movie just didn&apos;t have it. It lacked the juice that story of Guan Yu has in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. His enemies were all pathetic shrimps too. There was no big battle scenes where Guan Yu would dispatch the most ferocious warriors the enemy can call to bear on him. Supporting characters, lacked the flare that the characters in the original story has. Also, why the movie chose this particular segment of Guan Yu&apos;s career to be put on screen is a mystery. It was one of the flattest part of his story.\n\nMaybe it&apos;ll take a CG to produce a character that would even remotely resemble Guan Yu, and the other heroes of this story. \n\nA dud, and just doesn&apos;t do any justice to the magnificent lore of Guan Yu.",

      "reviewBody": "Michael J. Fox is walking on sunshine at the apex of his career success (1987) in this contagiously likable Herbert Ross produced and directed comedy.\n\nRoss brings his prolific success from stage, opera, ballet, movies, and TV to this fun, frolicking and much-improved upon non-musical update of the 1960&apos;s Broadway and movie classic &apos;How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying&apos;.\n\nHerb is a bona-fide Hollywood legend, who over 40 years, worked with some of the greatest in the biz: Ray Stark, Neil Simon, Woody Allen, Mike Nichols, Vivien Leigh, Barbara Streisand, Baryshnikov, Shirley MacLaine, Anne Bancroft, Tom Skerritt, Liz Taylor, Peter O&apos;Toole, Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle, Steve Allen, Steve Martin, Richard Dreyfus, Kevin Bacon, Goldie Hawn, Dolly Pardon, Julia Roberts, Sally Fields, Olivia Dukakis, Sam Shephard, and Michael J. Fox, plus many more.\n\nFew can compare to Herb&apos;s Rennaisance-Man performing-arts background as a dancer, actor, choreographer, director and producer. Movies and/or plays he directed and/or choreographed include another 80&apos;s classic &apos;Footloose&apos;, as well as The Turning Point, The Goodbye Girl, Play It Again Sam, Protocol, California Suite, Nininski, The Seven Percent Solution, Funny Girl, Funny Lady, On A Clear Day You Can See Forever, The Owl And The Pussycat, Who&apos;s Afraid Of Virginia Wolf, Inside Daisy Clover, Goodbye Mr. Chips, The Sunshine Boys, Max Dugan Returns, I Ought To Be In Pictures, Pennies From Heaven, My Blue Heaven, True Colors, Steel Magnolias, Boys On The Side, and more.\n\nBut &apos;The Secret Of My Success&apos; is ALL about Michael J. Fox, and Ross choreographs this non-stop comedy romp through the corporate take-over era of the 1980&apos;s, that engagingly showcases Fox&apos;s comedic acting style - an absolute must-see film for any MJ Fox fan.",

      "reviewBody": "By the time Adolf Hitler (b. 1889) had written Mein Kampf (My Struggle) he had already surmised that at least half of Germany&apos;s problems during World War 1 were due to the lack of vision and skill to use and project propaganda, to give it its political tag, enlightenment. This, the method of control of the mind, body and soul to enhance its people to complete dominance, oppression and obedience of the Will through fear, hatred, paranoia, to the point of xenophobia. Hitler had learned his lesson with extreme interest and with the onslaught of his uprising to the days of his decline he had used the medium of the moment; film.\n\nDr. (Paul) Joseph Goebbels (b. 1897), Hitler&apos;s appointed minister for Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, had total control over all mediums, and film and cinema were to be his greatest ally. (Worthy of note here is the David Welch book &quot;Propaganda and the German Cinema; 1933-1945&quot; that delves into the mind and machine that is both Goebbels and his highly controlled medium which analyses major German propaganda film and documentaries of that era). \n\nHere, with reel one, with A Film Unfinished, we see the birth of an idea that bears fruition but is never completed; the title of this film, within this documentary that is being examined is, simply, called The Ghetto. With no dialogue, no sound but simply a moment caught in time, it is, on first viewing, an account of life within the Ghetto of Warsaw: good, bad or indifferent. It is with this in mind that we are given an account of several interwoven worlds; we are shown the rich, the poor, the destitute and those with, seemingly, influence all congesting in one tiny mass of land, three square miles, committing to weddings, parties, funerals, a circumcision and life, all 400,000. \n\nWhat A Film Unfinished tries to dispel here is the fact that with the finding of a second reel, later, the whole process before now looks very much tainted and dubious, Ms. Yael Hersonski has uncovered a conspiracy of fear and total obedience within the Warsaw Ghetto, conducted by the Nazi propaganda machine. Breaking the myth that what we have witnessed beforehand has been nothing more than a fabricated, constructed and manipulated tool to express how the Nazi regime and in particular, the Jewish community here, were living life happily, freely and independently. \n\nThis valid point of photo manipulation begs the question &quot;What can we believe?&quot;, if this second reel had never been found would we still, with extreme caution perhaps, take the whole scenario for granted? What Ms. Hersonski has done is to discharge the myth of life, not so much as in the Ghetto, but the Nazis&apos; point of view of life within its streets, with the account of first hand witnesses&apos; and to have, too, an account from one of the Nazi camera crew. All making their point very well, an elaborate hoax. \n\nWhat cannot be covered up with lies here is the squalor, deprivation and hunger that conflicts with the affluent rich that coincide with this open prison, this, just may have been the image that the Nazi propaganda machine wanted to project, a polar opposite of a community living side-by-side. To steer both resentment and disgust for these people by portraying them as weak and at the same time a selfish race. \n\nThe scene in which children caught with food under their clothing and forced to empty their pockets, seeing the food spill out onto the street, is both heartbreaking and at the same time untrustworthy, again, one has to be careful in judging what we see, as we have now become aware that not all we see is accountably factual. This is the power of the medium of film and this, too, ironically, is the power of Ms. Hersonski work here. Raising questions that need to be asked, has the documentary film ever been so poorly placed, so exposed to the point of questionable doubt. Can we truly believe in what we are seeing, even with today&apos;s medium playing its role in contemporary societies? There is only one possible simple answer, one possible simple solution, trust not in what you see on the screen but trust more in what one has to say, to hear and to experience. This is where the true documentary lies.",

      "reviewBody": "Unlike some other German movies of the 1950s, this one is still worth watching. It is a true adaptation of Erich Kästner&apos;s children&apos;s&apos; novel of the same name. The author did not only write the screenplay himself , but also appears in the first and last scene and provides the narrator&apos;s voice in several scenes. With a cast of prominent German actors of the time, notably Paul Dahlke and Paul Klinger, and budding rock&apos;n&apos;roll star Peter Kraus in his first movie role, the movie tells the story of the &quot;Tertia&quot; students (7th/8th grade) in a small town boarding school, who continue a &quot;prehistoric&quot; feud with the boys from a neighbouring school. Woven into this narrative are questions of honesty, courage, loyalty, friendship - and money issues, which never lack in Kästner&apos;s books. The boys also write and perform a play about the lessons with their favourite teacher, Johannes Böck called Justus (the just one) and moreover manage to bring him back together with a long-lost childhood friend. I was astonished to see the very good acting of the child actors, among them now famous German director Michael Verhoeven. Even though it&apos;s sometimes obvious that painted scenery is used and the editing is somewhat less varied than what we&apos;re used to these days, the movie never seems dated in a way that makes it an effort to watch - quite the contrary!",

Thomas Daggett, a priest turned cop  (Elias Koteas - &apos;Crash&apos;, &apos;Exotica&apos;), stumbles across the corpse of an angel and a Bible with an extra chapter to the Book of Revelation, which mentions a war in heaven. Soon enough he becomes involved in a fight between the angels Gabriel (Christopher Walken in one of his best roles) and Simon (an impressive Eric Stoltz) over an evil man&apos;s soul. \n\nA fascinating, atmospheric movie packed with interesting ideas, scenes and performances. Writer/Director Gregory Widen (only previous work of note: &apos;The Highlander&apos;!) really comes up with the goods in this one, which nods to both Milton and Garth Ennis while adding several original touches. Also co-stars Virginia Madsen (&apos;Dune&apos;, &apos;The Hot Spot&apos;), Amanda Plummer (&apos;Butterfly Kiss&apos;, and Walken and Stoltz&apos; co-star in &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;), and a small but memorable appearance by Viggo Mortensen (&apos;The Indian Runner&apos;, &apos;American Yakuza&apos;) as Lucifer!"

      "reviewBody": "This is one of Satyajit Ray&apos;s movies shot and released just before he died. Starring Ray regulars who I can say are the Brandos and Pacinos of Bengali cinema this film is one of a kind  Deep and intellectual. It is a story of a family who was hastily assembled together in a colonial mansion by the deathbed of its patriarch who has suffered from a heart attack. The father is an idealist who was a freedom fighter and still is active in politics hoping that something could be done to correct the path the country (India) has taken (post independence) and stem the rot that had set in society. Gathered by his side are his sons who have all carved a distinct path through the maze we call society. Yes! They are successful. But his sense of failure comes from the fact his ideals and values have not seeped into the conscience of his off springs. The film shows the audience why and how that happened. Ultimately it&apos;s all about the rot that has set in the moral fabric of his family and his feeling how can he correct the society if he can&apos;t instill the same values in his family? This ultimately contributes to his sorrow, frustration and finally his death.\n\nHad this film been a Hollywood project helmed by a A listed director and starring A listed actors this surely would have dominated the Oscars that year. The development of the story is brilliant and so is the direction (its Ray for crissakes) but people who don&apos;t like slow moving artsy movies won&apos;t share my sentiments. That&apos;s for sure. But for connoisseurs of Ray it&apos;s a classy picture. Do yourself a favor. Watch it!",

      "reviewBody": "Set during the period of English history when the Bubonic plague spreads death across the land, a troubled young monk named Osmund is recruited by a band of soldiers to investigate a village that remains untouched. What they find there will change them forever.\n\nHaving enjoyed Christopher Smith&apos;s previous movies (&quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;Severance&quot; and &quot;Triangle&quot;), I had high hopes for &quot;Black Death&quot; and was not disappointed. Although the gore of his previous movies is still evident during the battle scenes in which arms are severed by swords and heads crushed by maces, it&apos;s largely underplayed here with the script placing greater emphasis on the story&apos;s themes of faith, religion, superstition and love. It is this emphasis, along with the various twists in the plot, which make the choices faced by the characters in the third act of the movie so very interesting.\n\nI was repeatedly reminded of the original &quot;Wicker Man&quot; whilst watching &quot;Black Death&quot;, not only because of the central theme of a devout Christian confronting something terrible which attempts to challenge and undermine his own beliefs, but also because of the cold, bleak cinematography reminiscent of a seventies horror movie. The entire production is nicely directed and Smith utilises his horror knowledge to keep a constant and oppressive threat running throughout the film, regardless of the scene, to maximum effect. The visual effects, whether for the symptoms of the plague itself or for the various wounds suffered by the characters, are also excellent.\n\nThe cast are universally fantastic, although Sean Bean&apos;s towering performance – portraying the leader of the soldiers and a man &quot;more dangerous than pestilence&quot; – steals the movie. Eddie Redmayne does well in the central role of Osmund and manages to make his character&apos;s personal journey both interesting and believable, whilst Carice van Houten is also memorable in an important role during the second half of the movie.\n\nI was very impressed by &quot;Black Death&quot; and would recommend it to those who enjoy atmospheric horror movies such as the aforementioned &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; or &quot;Don&apos;t Look Now&quot;, as well as those who seek out movies set in or around this period of Britain such as &quot;In The Name Of The Rose&quot; and &quot;The Reckoning&quot;. Although parts are grim and even upsetting, it&apos;s never dull and is definitely a movie worthy of your time and support.",

      "reviewBody": "This film was actually okay. Not great but not bad either. It was good. Above average. However it is the actors that make this film worthwhile and worth watching. NOT the script. Raaj Kumar as usual delivers a great performance. Sunil Dutt looked pretty young even though he was a 54-year-old actor trying to play a young character. The one actor who is given the most justice in here is Raaj Kumar. Dharmendra is just average in this film. Kamal Hassan was average in this film as well. The dialogue delivery done by Raaj Kumar is just amazing. The other actors like Hema Malini, Reena Roy, Ajit etc are just okay okay in this film. Ummmmmmmmmmmmm. The action was above average. The item songs were good. I&apos;m amazed at how young Raaj Kumar &amp; Sunil Dutt look despite being so old. Other than that their isn&apos;t very much to say. Watch this film just for the actors not for the script. The script isn&apos;t even that bad it&apos;s an above average one.",

      "reviewBody": "In first few minutes of &quot;The Washing Machine,&quot; Vida (busty Katarzyna Figura) has make up sex with her gangster boyfriend/pimp Yuri (Yorgo Voyagis) in front of an open refrigerator. Watching from the stairs is one of Vida&apos;s two sisters she shares the apartment with, Ludmilla (Barbara Ricci). Ludmilla hikes up her nightgown and spreads her legs to give us a perfect view of her white panties. Then she starts playing a triangle (no, that isn&apos;t a euphemism), Vida and Yuri seemingly oblivious to her musical accompaniment, until Vida looks over her shoulder to give her sister a knowing smile.\n\nThings get weirder later that night when Ludmilla discovers Yuri&apos;s body hacked to pieces and stuffed inside the washing machine (hence the awful English title). Or did she? By the time the police arrive the next morning there is no body, because what&apos;s a giallo without a mysteriously disappearing corpse? But Ludmilla and her sisters Vida and Sissy report a murder anyway. Inspector Stacev (Philippe Caroit) dismisses the women as cranks, only to be drawn into conducting an investigation when the sisters contact him separately, alternately trying to seduce him (or flat out forcing themselves on him like Vida does) and tease him with information that might prove Yuri was murdered.\n\nThe plot of &quot;The Washing Machine&quot; doesn&apos;t withstand close scrutiny and often revelations are made as if screenwriter Luigi Spagnol just thought of them the day of filming (e.g., Ludmilla having a drinking problem, Stacev being into S/M). But with such crazy set pieces as Sissy (Ilaria Borrelli) having sex with Stacev in the middle of a museum while blind students wander around them, who cares? \n\n&quot;The Washing Machine&quot; promises a sleazy good time and almost delivers. Where it disappoints is how it handles its numerous trashy elements. It&apos;s not that it goes too far; it often doesn&apos;t go far enough. Given that the movie is directed by Ruggero Deodato, the man who gave us &quot;Cannibal Holocaust,&quot; it&apos;s downright tame. Breasts are exposed every 10 minutes or so, but the numerous sex scenes aren&apos;t terribly creative or explicit. The women seldom get totally naked (only Borrelli does full frontal) and the men all have sex completely clothed. There are Shannon Tweed vehicles that push the envelope further than this movie does. Deodato is less restrained with the gory moments, but there are few of those. For me, &quot;The Washing Machine&quot; is summed up in its opening scene: kinky and weird but refusing to take off its underwear.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is one of only two dramatic feature films made using Cinerama&apos;s three-strip process. Watching the film on home video represents a compromise but Warner&apos;s latest edition offers as good a presentation as you&apos;re likely to see outside of a Cinerama theatre.\n\nThe film, which was based on a series of &apos;Life&apos; magazine articles, traces the fortunes of the Prescott family as they take part in the westward expansion in 19th century America. The story unfolds over several decades and touches on the Gold Rush, the Civil War and other periods in American history. James R. Webb&apos;s screenplay, while more entertaining than historically exhaustive, won him an Oscar.\n\nThe cast is about as star-studded a bunch as you&apos;re likely to see anywhere. Where else can you see Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda &amp; John Wayne all in same film? Not to mention Karl Malden, Gregory Peck, Eli Wallach, Richard Widmark, Walter Brennan and others too numerous to mention. Needless to say, the acting is in good hands.\n\nTechnically, the film looks quite nice. The Oscar-nominated cinematography is breath-taking and Alfred Newman&apos;s score is top-notch. However, the filming process made for an overabundance of long shots and there are a few instances of rear projection that frankly look bad next to the rest of the picture. Also, while not a fault per se, there are geometric distortions inherent in displaying the curved picture on a flat screen.\n\nYet, despite its minor imperfections, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is an attractive and engaging epic Western. As a history lesson, it&apos;s somewhat superficial but the combination of fine acting and stunning visuals make it well worth your time. Just be sure to pick up the Special Edition or Blu-ray release.",

Houseman and Bottoms shine, the rest of the cast (while a bit too stuffy) seem to compliment them without flaw.  I liked seeing a very young (unspoiled) Lindsey Wagner in her pre-bionic woman days.  Truthfully, though certainly dated at this point, this film still held my interest.  I was, however, disappointed in the last scene, for although it may have meant to be liberating for the Bottoms character to shift his priorities the timing, (upon receipt of his final grades) seemed ill chosen.  Still, one can&apos;t help but root for him through all of this. In the end one wonders if while retaining his idealism he sacrificed his sanity.",

      "reviewBody": "SO BIG is a lovely little gem that&apos;s only problem is it&apos;s much too short, just 81 minutes, given the story&apos;s scope. Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by the usually critically underrated Edna Ferber, famed in the era for her epic novels (GIANT), one can blame Warner Bros. for their reluctance to make longer pictures in this era but at least give them credit for filming this tale, it&apos;s impossible to imagine this bleak setting being filmed at either at glamorous and elegant MGM or Paramount.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck stars as Selina, a motherless girl who lives a well-to-do existence with her professional gambler father in big city hotels. Despite his rather shady calling, her father has taught her the finer things in life and raised her properly. Her father is shot and killed when she is a young woman over an apparent gambling dispute which leads to having to go to work as a schoolteacher in a small farming community. There she befriends a young preteen named Rolf (the wonderful Dick Winslow in a superb performance) who is forced to work on his father&apos;s farm instead of go to school, giving him books and encouraging his artistic endeavors and his dreams of life beyond farm work. Barbara marries a young farmer and gets trapped herself in the hard life of farm work, particularly after she is widowed young with a little son Dirk to raise on her own. Dirk benefits from his mother&apos;s sacrifices and becomes a young architect but is bored and impatient and fails to share his mother&apos;s love of beauty and a good work ethic that she successfully installed in Rolf.\n\nThe cast is generally superb - this is one of Barbara Stanwyck&apos;s finest early roles and she is quite moving at times. She has fine support from teen Dick Winslow, whom I don&apos;t recall seeing before, and from some generally unnoticed supporting players like Dorothy Peterson as Winslow&apos;s prematurely aged mother, Robert Warwick as Stanwyck&apos;s loving conman of a father, Earle Fox as the rather good-looking but common man she marries, and Blanche Fredrici as the rich old spinster who pines for Fox herself. There&apos;s also a delightful appearance of the much loved character Elizabeth Patterson, dressed to the nines in period costumes as Stanwyck&apos;s city landlady and excellent work by a startlingly beautiful young Bette Davis as the young artist the adult Dirk fancies. Alas, the adult Dirk, Hardie Albright, is not particularly good (and there&apos;s a particularly bad scene in which he and Mae Madison, as his married paramour, are not able to carry by themselves) but at least George Brent as the adult Rolf is better than normal if not quite capturing the fire, intelligence, and drive Winslow did as the younger Rolf. I&apos;m surprised no one has noticed the young Selina is played by lovely Anne Shirley, who would go on to her greatest fame as Stanwyck&apos;s daughter in their classic STELLA DALLAS five years later. Talk about superb casting for a young Stanwyck!! \n\nThis story really cries out for a film of a least two hours with it&apos;s multi-decade scope, it really jumps years much too often, much too quickly, but still it&apos;s a highly satisfying, often quite touching film that&apos;s well worth seeing. This movie also makes me want to seek out Ms. Ferber&apos;s rather forgotten novel, which surprisingly is still in print.",

      "reviewBody": "Ah, now I saw this film whilst browsing as you do, and thought I&apos;d make a comment as this is a favourite of mine.\n\nNow it&apos;s no Oscar winner and the plot is ridiculous really, straight out of a comic book. But lets face it, this film is all about the action. The kung-fu sequences show you in this film what a wasted talent Mark Dacascus is. He never gets the credit he deserves, and whilst not a great actor, he is very likable and a talented martial artist. It&apos;s such a shame we don&apos;t see him in more enjoyable movies; If you only ever watch Mark in one movie, make it this one. There&apos;s a great cast, who seem to be having a lot of fun, the film pays homage to Jackie Chan movies at points plus the fight choreography is well thought out.\n\nThe fight sequences are filmed in a very unique way, with the camera moving at very sharp, precise angles, which gives it a unique style. You never miss a move and the fighting does go at a fast pace. At the end of the day, a kung-fu movie lives or dies on the strength of it&apos;s fight scenes. Although not the best scenes you will see, the combination of humour and good action direction, really show off the skills on offer here.\n\nSo if you&apos;re a martial arts movie fan, and not seen this, give this it a whirl! It might just pleasantly surprise you.",

Not surprisingly, with his amazing reputation for perfection, he was able to once again get many of America&apos;s top actors to provide their voice talents to the shows--such as Tom Hanks, Sam Waterston and Blythe Danner. And, like so many PBS documentaries, Peter Coyote narrates more than capably.\n\nThe miniseries consists of three episodes. The first is about the background leading to Prohibition--the temperance movement and problems with alcohol over-consumption. It also ends with the implementation of the Constitutional Amendment. Part Two is about the practical aspects of the law. The difficulty in enforcement is due to a lack of widespread support, loopholes in the law as well as the way the law actually ENCOURAGED the growth of organized crime. Part Three is about the rising dislike of the law that led to its repeal.\n\nOverall, it&apos;s yet another very good series by Ken Burn and is among the best shows you can find on the topic. Well worth your time--and it manages to make an educational show fun...of sorts.",

His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean&apos;s ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it&apos;s light; yes, it&apos;s a trifle but it&apos;s so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She&apos;s beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.",

      "name": "A thought-provoking look at revivalist religion in which includes the magnetic presence of Burt Lancaster",
      "reviewBody": "Excellent recounting based on the controversial Sinclair Lewis novel that got three Academy Awards . A brooding look at revivalist religion in which the over-the-top acting of Burt Lancaster steals the show . Concerning about some preachers exact wealth and power from their congregration . As Elmer (Burt Lancaster) is a saleman with a powerfully persusive tongue who joins up Sister Sharon Falconer (glamorous Jean Simmons) along with her colleagues , Sister Rachel (Patti Page) , William L. Morgan (Dean Jagger) touring grass-roots evengelist circus during the depressed twenties . As the good Sister employs him as a Bible-spouting person to expand the God Will and along the way he gets considerable success . As Elmer turns an attractive and charming preacher with a large audience . As Granty flashes with his silver smile but he has a dark past . Later on , newspapers publicize ¨Preacher preys¨ and he becomes into a discredited preacher .\n\nThis top-notch movie perfectly exposes and denounce the flamboyant , small-town evangelists tours spreading throughout at the Depression time . It contains top-drawer performances , strong sense of period and place conveyed by a lush camerawork , there&apos;s still plenty to enjoy . A magnificent look at the discredited charlatans and popular religion which , with the passing of the years is still holding many eye-brows . That said , it is intelligent , witty , entertaining and provoking thanks largely to the awesome presence of Burt Lancaster. Delving into the human psyche in such extreme situations and dealing with the issue of swindlers , false preachers , and other fraudulent healers . Reviewers applauded this prize-winning story that works on many levels , being constantly reconfigured and plenty of drama and interesting frames . Brooks&apos; script delves beneath the surface , dealing with the relationship between religion , sex , corruption , faith and money . Some great stars , as Burt Lancaster who is extraordinary as the amoral Southern preacher , Burt has rightly said : ¨This was my best part ever , I would rather play one role as exciting and vital as Elmer Granty than a dozen of those handsome , big heroes who always get the beautiful girl¨. Including a host of fine interpretation from a great support cast : Shirley Jones as his ex-girlfriend who resorts to a life of prostitution , Arthur Kennedy as a disbelieving journalist , John McIntire , Patti Page , as a disbelieving reporter , Dean Jagger , Hugh Marlowe ,Edward Andrews , Rex Ingram , among others . And brief appearances from Ed Nelson , Barbara Luna , Jean Wiles , Barry Kelley and John Qualen .\n\nIt packs a colorful and evocative cinematography by John Alton , who along with John Seitz and Nicolas Musuruka are deemed to be the best cameramen of Film Noir . As well as moving and sensitive score y Andre Previn . This classy multi-Oscar-Winning rendition was well directed and screen-played in awesome style by Richard Brooks . It won various Oscars as Best actor : Burt Lancaster as the astute salesman turned preacher , support cast actress : Richard&apos;s corrosive screenplay . Brooks was a fine writer/director so consistently mixed the good and average which it became impossible to know that to expect from him next . Firstly he worked regularly as a Hollywood screenwriter . After that , his initial experience of directing was one of his own screenplays called ¨Crisis¨. The Richard Brooks films that have the greatest impact are realized during the 50s and 60s as ¨Cat on a hot tin roof¨, ¨Something of value¨ , ¨Elmer Gantry¨, ¨Sweet bird of youth¨, ¨In cold blood¨ , ¨Lord Jim¨. Brooks was a writer and director of Chekhovian depth , who mastered the use of understatement, anticlimax and implied emotion . His films enjoyed lasting appeal and tended to be more serious than the usual mainstream productions . Richards formerly directed two good Western titled ¨Bite the bullet¨ and ¨The professionals ¨ with various tough stars as Burt Lancaster , Lee Marvin , Jack Palance and Robert Ryan . ¨Elmer Granty¨ is an authentic must see , a masterpiece not to be missed for buffs of the dramatic genre . A magnificent movie , being nowadays very well considered . Rating : Above average because of its awesome acting , dialog , score are world class.",

The cast is amazing and deliver in their performances, the stunning visuals and beautiful music combine to create a dreamy atmosphere through which S. Potter uses Orlando as a medium to make subtle and elegant commentaries about life, the human condition and the struggle of the sexes to understand each other when they are basically two aspects of the same coin. As opposed to some of the other reviewers here I did not find the movie slow or boring at any time. Nor is it just about Orlando; there are multiple layers. It flows simply and quietly but with great intensity and an underlying irony at every moment. This film must be Potter&apos;s masterpiece.",

There are not many movies in Post-Soviet space, which can show us birth of a new creature with such a courage. The delivery scene of the film, which is a culmination of a film is a catharsis creating moment.\n\nThe dialogs and monologues are great. I watched the film in Rissian and the dialogs were the brilliant reflection of folksy mind, always practical, straight but magic at the same time. The best monologue of the former sailor, who is the leading star, opens the film.\n\nThe scenery is great. The space of a film is very informative. There are many little details that tell us about the steppe life without any words, such as steppe tractor, which is decorated with glued naked women&apos;s pictures, radio set, which the shepherd&apos;s son always keeps in his hands and many other.\n\nAnd the message of the film which brings the leading star, who is impetuous and reckless at the beginning of the film, but later on he becomes wiser, is very simple and traditional. You can build castles in the air as long as you want, but to build them on the land you should make many little steps every day. And to reach a goal you should be not only persistent but adaptable and be capable to forgive your nearest and dearest.",

The film is at times creaky but it&apos;s understandable because it was made over 70 years ago! There are several stand-out scenes in MOROCCO, including the famous kiss scene and the one when Marlene breaks a pearl necklace but what makes this Sternberg film so memorable is the stunning ending. Suddenly, the creaky film looks positively contemporary. Are we really in 1930s and not the wild 1970s?!?! The brilliant ending MAKES the movie. Without it, it would probably have been an enjoyably moody but average 1930s flick. With it, MOROCCO becomes a timeless classic. It&apos;s probably the most stunning ending ever made, with so many layers of meaning with that one prolonged static shot. It&apos;s visually brilliant and sexy on so many levels.",

Sadly this didn&apos;t last and by 1978 she was on the slide and consigned to doing these Italian &quot;erotic comedies&quot;.\n\nDone also by Fenech and Guida with the same plot style, this is no better. Set in the obligatory teen secondary school, Cassini is cast as Claudia, the gym mistress. Cue a suitable excuse to show off her fine physique in tights trying to teach pupils and staff how to dance.\n\nThe main problem is that we see too little of Miss Cassini (only briefly showing us some of what she is made of in the sauna) and the nudity as a whole is very tame indeed. And is it funny? Well I&apos;m not Italian, so I guess I just didn&apos;t get it ....",

What I found most interesting are seeing Michael Douglas in his 20s and Jodie Foster about 8 or 9 when the filming was done, and mentally comparing that to their mega-star status today."

I have no special interest in wine, and yet I found this very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. While he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. He shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don&apos;t want to tell.\n\nThe movie shows us where our world is going to, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. It is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big, personal and global, character and formula.\n\nThe real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves.\n\nIt takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing, but it&apos;s worth it.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Of course for everyone who understands and enjoys old soviet cinematograph.\n\nCurious fact. Alisa Selezneva, in one of the scenes, was making predictions for her school mates. They were all predicted to become celebrities or at least some success. But in real life most of those young actors became simple taxi drivers or small shop owners.\n\nHowever the elder part of the crew managed to stay in actors profession.

That&apos;s not directed (I hope), but the funniest thing is when narrator says that &quot;they put feathers of dead birds on girl&apos;s head as the symbol that she may fly above unhappiness and poverty like these birds!&quot; Hahaha, yeah right, they flew really high. There is also LaVey, who is funniest of all. But the creepiest thing is psychedelic flower music that&apos;s in background all the time, and no matter how ridiculous movie is, it was scary for me to look at some freaky voodoo cemetery ritual with psychedelic groove in the background. Seariously, it&apos;s obvious that this movie was supposed to have educational tone, witch maybe it had in 1970., but today it looks like poor Christian mockumentary on everything &quot;blasphemous&quot;. This isn&apos;t movie that&apos;ll teach you anything about occult and supernatural; this is the movie you should watch with your friends and have really good laugh.\n\nP.S. Last part of the movie is about cryogenics. Guess that was occult in the 1970&apos;s.",

Characters were not fully developed, acting was mediocre at best, storyline was not thoroughly thought, editing was not commendable, the set was improper. Several plot holes and lack of continuity throughout made this movie unbearable to watch. I do not think this is the work of a professional movie maker. I rarely write a comment, but this movie deserve it.",

I can&apos;t remember the last time I was so entertained.\n\nAlthough it is a bit slow at times, and a bit predictable (although fun in it&apos;s predictability), it hardly lets up and continuously entertains.\n\nIf you loved the original, you will DEFINITELY love this film. The ending not only makes you laugh, it makes you think &quot;What the hell?&quot; and will make you eagerly anticipate (major understatement) the third installment.\n\nThere are some great lines, the same fun characters, an inventive and fun story, and some brilliantly staged action sequences.\n\nIn summation: SEE IT!

      "reviewBody": "In a small Kansas town, beautiful blonde waitress Renee Zellweger (as Betty Sizemore) enjoys watching her favorite soap opera &quot;A Reason to Love&quot; starring handsome doctor Greg Kinnear (as George &quot;David Ravell&quot; McCord). Following a tragedy, Ms. Zellweger traumatically imagines she is a character in the soap opera she adores. As if she was on the TV show, Zellweger wants to work as a nurse and romance Mr. Kinnear. Tied in with the tragedy, her criminal Kansas customers Morgan Freeman (as Charlie) and Chris Rock (as Wesley) follow Zellweger westward, looking for drugs...\n\nThis could have been brilliant...\n\nArtfully directed by Neil LaBute, the story by John C. Richards, &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; almost works. We have parallel American dream stories. First, there is the longing of Zellweger for the seemingly unattainable world existing only in &quot;Hollywood&quot;. Knocked out of her mind by violent reality, she begins to live her dream. In her delirium, Zellweger pursues TV star Kinnear, with whom she has an imagined relationship. While this occurs, a more subtle loss of mind is experienced by Mr. Freeman, who begins to fall in love with Zellweger&apos;s character. A violent old Black criminal fantasizes a relationship with a pretty young White woman. Even more daring is which relationship is given the go, and which one is stopped dead in its tracks...\n\nBlack comedy, indeed...\n\nAlso a problem is the characterization of Freeman&apos;s sidekick, essayed by Mr. Rock. The professional comedian is the least funny (and most dispensable) of the comedy&apos;s quartet. If his reason for being there is meant to soften Freeman&apos;s character, it doesn&apos;t work. Freeman is made more despicable due to his connection with Rock&apos;s completely unlikable character. Perhaps the goal was to pair up the accomplished actor with the abrasive comedian. Actors and comics are not always interchangeable. Rock is unable to nail it down. There is promise in Rock&apos;s performance, though. He can also look to Kinnear for inspiration; a failed reporter then funny talk show host, Kinnear should have a shelf of &quot;Supporting Actor&quot; awards.\n\n******* Nurse Betty (5/11/00) Neil LaBute ~ Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Greg Kinnear, Chris Rock",

      "reviewBody": "... that I could watch once a month every month, year in and year out, and of which I would never tire.\n\nThe Day family is headed by the authoritarian and often eccentric father, Clarence Day Sr., played brilliantly by William Powell. Powell brings his signature charm and wit to the character, making Clarence Sr. A lovable figure despite his quirks. Irene Dunne portrays his equally strong-willed but supportive wife, Vinnie, with grace and impeccable comedic timing. The chemistry between Powell and Dunne is the film&apos;s backbone, with them often being at odds, at least on the surface.\n\nSet in late 19th-century New York City, it captures the charm and idiosyncrasies of this conservative Victorian family in a lighthearted and amusing manner. Clarence Day demands that the family finances be run on a business basis, but his family thwarts him at every turn. However, the main conflict in the film occurs when Vinnie discovers, by Clarence Sr.&apos;s own admission, that he has never been baptized. Being dogmatic about the Protestant religion, she openly fears for his soul, believing that he will not be admitted into heaven without this event occurring, and even wondering if they are really married in the eyes of God. Day finds the whole business ridiculous and refuses to be baptized, since he would feel himself to be a spectacle to be baptized in middle age. Religion is something he tolerates as long as it does not become a bother.\n\nAlong the way a haunted suit, a ceramic pug dog, patent medicines prior to the FDA, a revolving door of maids, and the oldest son of the family, Clarence Jr., wondering if Episcopalians and Methodists can peacefully coexist (he wants to court a Methodist girl and he is Episcopalian) create charming situations that make this movie special. Expertly directed by Michael Curtiz who manages to make this play adapted into a movie not appear episodic.\n\nThe casting of this film actually turned into a mini &quot;Scarlet O&apos;Hara War&quot; in regards to who would play Mrs. Day. Myrna Loy, Rosalind Russell, Rosemary DeCamp, Jean Arthur, Bette Davis, and Mary Pickford all campaigned for the job but in the end lost out to Irene Dunne. Pickford took the loss especially hard, hoping that this would be her comeback role.",

      "reviewBody": "Adaptation of Irving Wallace&apos;s book about a 30-year-old novel titled &quot;The Seven Minutes,&quot; banned worldwide for three decades as being depraved and obscene, coming under fire once again after the son of a major political contributor in California is charged with raping a girl--under the influence of the erotic material! This coincides with the case of a bookstore manager arrested for selling a recent reprint of &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot;, resulting in a trial that pits pornography against free speech. Director Russ Meyer&apos;s second (and final) film for 20th Century Fox is admirably serious in its attempt to show the hypocrisy of so-called purveyors of decency and political opportunists looking for a legal scapegoat, yet it is too bogged down in talk to appeal to Meyer&apos;s fan-base (despite the quick cutting which reduces most shots to a length of seven seconds or less). Yvonne De Carlo has a bravura cameo in the third act as a key witness for the defense, and there&apos;s an amusingly old-fashioned tag featuring the defense attorney and his girl making love in front of a roaring fire. But the majority of &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot; concerns itself with the legal protection of salacious material instead of the usual Russ Meyer presentation of salacious material, which didn&apos;t thrill audiences in 1971 and probably won&apos;t today. *1/2 from ****",

Even the costumes seem to be made for a dude ranch. There&apos;s only one or two scenes that are fun to watch, the rest is just boooring. Take my advice and spare yourself the time.

Former paratrooper Ivan (Mikhail Porechenkov) is forced by his old team to perform an assassination or his kidnapped daughter Zhenya (Mikhail&apos;s real life daughter Varvara Porechenkova) gets it. Naturally, he escapes and begins his hunt for his daughter along with the help of stewardess Aliya (Aleksandra Ursuliak). Not totally sure why the Russians chose this one 23 years later to model their film after, but it is nearly identical. There are a few tweaks here and there, sometimes improving upon the source material (like the mall fight now taking place at a water park). Having him as a paratrooper leads to a more exciting plane escape and, when he doesn&apos;t jump off during the takeoff, the bad guy watching the plane says, &quot;Eh, Schwarzenegger would have jumped off.&quot; Porechenkov was also the director on this and adds a bit more comedy to the film (with some of it actually funny) and numerous references to Tarkovsky&apos;s SOLARIS (1972).

It is a brilliantly acted film, and that is why I have given it a 5 and no more. Another Way of really loving is not allowed these two women, and both the writer and the director made these choices. A film is not made by itself. The makers creatively could have chosen another way of ending the scenario and not taken the inevitable tragic trope that so often determines homosexual film ( at least it used to until the beginning of this century when a really independent gay cinema emerged and is still happily growing ). This is a film of despair, and quite rightly, given that it is set in one of the most homophobic countries in Europe and it is amazing it was even made at all. Hungary as then is still a homosexual hating place and both women would still meet with difficulties, but even back then in the so-called dark ages of gay oppression in Eastern Europe a hidden love could have found another way than the darkness meted out to them. How brave the film could have been if there had been a little more light in it. Just a little more and I would have rated it the masterpiece the actors deserved, but instead it ends up in the pit of death and loneliness. It is a timid revolution of a film.",

The fact that it all takes place in one small Bournemouth (England) hotel, no violence, no special effects, no thousands of extras, or vast expenditure says it all. Excellent performances from a star studded cast, especially David Niven. It is gripping from start to finish, but by modern standards in a gentle way. A movie possibly mainly for women, but as a man I can only say that I found it very moving. A film I will always watch whenever it comes around as it always will. A classic."

      "reviewBody": "Poor Kevin Costner. I get the feeling that he just can&apos;t win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than &apos;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&apos;? When he does use an accurate accent, as he does in &apos;Thirteen Days,&apos; he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I&apos;ve heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since, allegedly, they&apos;re the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that &apos;Wyatt Earp&apos; cancels out &apos;Dances With Wolves.&apos; I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and &apos;Thirteen Days&apos; is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.\n\n&apos;Thirteen Days&apos; was the fastest two and a half hours that I&apos;ve sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens (or should be able to infer it since we&apos;d all be dead right now if things hadn&apos;t worked out so well) but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons: 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen, but the characters don&apos;t. They are stressed, terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn&apos;t good drama, I don&apos;t know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark, this character driven movie excels.\n\nA second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner, there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable, hard-working and chameleon-like character actors. Len Cariou, Dylan Baker, Stephen Culp, and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don&apos;t, but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Undoubtedly the funniest bits are the extremely varied ways in which Woody Harrelson&apos;s character messes up - occasionally predictable, but well acted slapstick at its best. John Cleese was middling, best at the end, while the opening sequence has a splendid running gag and a marvellous outbreak by Alicia Silverstone. Perhaps Rachael Leigh Cook&apos;s and Paulo Costanzo&apos;s talents are underused, and the actor who played George Sr. in Arrested Development makes only a guest appearance. I hope there will be more good writing like this from Joe Wein.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.\n\nAfter seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end.\n\nSet in, no surprise here, Bruges, Belgium, the plot focuses on two London hit men, Ray played by Colin Farrell, and Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson. The pair is sent to Belgium after Ray botches his first hi. And therein lies the humor, Ray has no interest in being in the medieval city, and Ken wants to sight see.\n\nI&apos;ve never really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson&apos;s character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell&apos;s Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair&apos;s criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes&apos;s Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of menace when he travels to Bruges to square off with Ken. Also, of note, is Jordan Prentice, an irritable dwarf who&apos;s in town to act in a movie filming there. His ramblings in one scene, about a coming race war, is worth the price of admission right there.\n\nThe only aspect of the film that didn&apos;t work for me was Ray&apos;s love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance seems a little forced and comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it&apos;s a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice.\n\nI intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I&apos;ve mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don&apos;t won&apos;t to ruin it for anyone else.\n\nIn Bruges is a good film. Go see it.\n\nAt the very least, it&apos;ll make you want to visit Bruges.",

      "reviewBody": "A woman (Joan Collins) gives birth to a baby, but this is no ordinary little tyke. The child is seemingly possessed by the spirit of a freaky, sexual dwarf (George Claydon) whom the mother once spurned. From director Peter Sasdy, who made &quot;Countess Dracula&quot; (1971) and &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot; (also 1971).\n\nFirst, let me absolutely say that I love this film being retitled &quot;Sharon&apos;s Baby&quot;. The original title, &quot;Devil Within Her&quot;, is so much better, and the new title just sounds like a cheesy knockoff of &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot;... which, of course, is a film it could never live up to. Sounds like the sort of new title that would get it played at sleazy drive-ins or theaters on 42nd Street.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome. Not unlike Goblin&apos;s work in Italian films, it seems that the musicians here were going for the same style. The only problem is that this style of music only works in Italian films... and sounds completely silly in British or American works. I loved it, but I can imagine the average person wondering what the heck is going on.\n\nHorror fans will love seeing Donald Pleasence, who has far too small of a role as Dr. Finch. Maybe he did not read the script, or maybe it sounded better on paper than it turned out on film, but I am glad he signed on for this.\n\nAt the time of release, Andrew Nickolds wrote that he film was &quot;derivative and disastrous in every respect: a poor idea... an abominable screenplay by Stanley Price... ludicrous acting... and worst of all, Sasdy&apos;s direction. Almost every foot of film not concerned with the baby is travelogue at its most banal – extraneous shots of Westminster and Oxford Street, plugs for Fortnum &amp; Mason and Holiday Inns. Completing this sorry tale of rip-off is borrowing from The Exorcist... and any number of details from Amicus, Hammer and Swinging London horrors. Give it a wide berth.&quot; Wow, Andrew, harsh! \n\nLuckily, the film has since enjoyed its place as a cult camp favorite, because really, who besides Nickolds was taking it that seriously?",

      "reviewBody": "1952&apos;s &quot;Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla&quot; was Realart&apos;s follow up to Lon Chaney&apos;s financially successful &quot;Bride of the Gorilla,&quot; producers Jack Broder and Herman Cohen looking for a similar hit with another horror star, shot in six days on an even lower budget of $12,000 (working titles &quot;Bela Lugosi Meets the Gorilla Man&quot; and &quot;White Woman of the Lost Jungle&quot;). Hollywood had ignored the chronically unemployed actor during the four years since his last triumph as Dracula in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,&quot; and here he was opposite another comedy team that only did this lone feature together, from a witless script cobbled together by Tim Ryan, husband of Irene Ryan from THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, better known as a tough guy actor in Poverty Row pictures (the reissue title was &quot;The Boys from Brooklyn&quot;). Nightclub performers known for aping Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Duke Mitchell delivers like Martin with laid back style on two songs, while teenager Sammy Petrillo looks and sounds so much like the genuine Lewis that one might easily be confused. The actual Martin and Lewis surely wouldn&apos;t have fared much better playing two entertainers trapped on a Pacific island (parachuting off screen of course) with nothing to do but venture into the castle of Lugosi&apos;s mad scientist Dr. Zabor, working on a theory of evolution using primates as guinea pigs. Ramona the chimp falls for Sammy, but the doctor&apos;s assistant (Charlita) is sweet on Duke, driving the jealous Zabor to a desperate plan to keep her from straying by transforming the luckless crooner into a gorilla. Both Ray Corrigan and Steve Calvert are available in ratty ape costumes, Duke unable to speak but still able to belt out his signature piece &quot;Deed I Do,&quot; giving Sammy ideas for a singing simian living close to the local zoo (while studying the later career of Bela Lugosi for Tim Burton&apos;s 1994 &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; Martin Landau considered this one so bad that the Wood titles looked like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by comparison). Both Mitchell and Petrillo could have carved out a niche for themselves were they not at the mercy of shopworn material, and by the time the real Martin and Lewis broke up in 1956 they too decided to call it quits (Lewis was more litigious than his partner, but only a great deal of shouting resulted). A native of Farrell, Pennsylvania, Mitchell later worked for Dean Martin himself, a man who certainly appreciated real talent, doing impressions of other singers and making a name for himself as &apos;King of Palm Springs.&apos; Sammy Petrillo&apos;s belief was that Jack Broder had no intention of making their starring feature, expecting a huge payout from Paramount not to do it but went ahead to save face. Sammy truly gives it his all, but a tendency to laugh uproariously at his own lame jokes deadens all attempts at humor well before Lugosi finally makes his entrance at the 21 minute mark. The Bronx-born Petrillo later opened a nightclub called The Nut House in his adopted hometown of Pittsburgh, lending a helping hand to up and comers like Richard Pryor and Dennis Miller. At the helm for this oddity was old pro William Beaudine, of &quot;The Ape Man,&quot; &quot;Ghosts on the Loose,&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Man,&quot; whose only remaining genre titles formed the 1965 double bill &quot;Billy the Kid versus Dracula&quot; and &quot;Jesse James Meets Frankenstein&apos;s Daughter.&quot; Veteran cameraman Charles Van Enger also photographed &quot;Bride of the Gorilla,&quot; a longtime Universal veteran (including Bela&apos;s &quot;Night Monster&quot;) with a dozen Abbott and Costello titles on his resume, his most recent being &quot;Meet the Killer Boris Karloff.&quot; It&apos;s possible that having his name in the title appeased Lugosi in some small way, he&apos;s perfectly fine in the role but it&apos;s very old and tired, no stretch for an actor so used to playing crazed doctors. The references to Dracula are numerous and not funny, and while Bela is often smiling in the early stages (17 minutes screen time), even he becomes annoyed at Sammy&apos;s antics before long, sadly looking forward only to &quot;The Black Sleep&quot; and the Ed Wood trio. After working with Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson, Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe, Joe E. Brown, W. C. Fields, The Ritz Brothers, Kay Kyser, the East Side Kids (twice), Wally Brown and Alan Carney (also twice), and most recently drag act Arthur Lucan, could an ersatz Martin and Lewis really look that bad?",

      "reviewBody": "In an interview given to one of the reporters, Mr. Verma, the director of the movie &quot;Phoonk&quot; had warned that the film would scare the hell out of the audiences and said that it would give one sleepless nights.Now, let me put this straight, after I had watched phoonk, I can come to the absolute conclusion that Mr. Ram gopal verma is losing his way out there completely. The situation is not far when people will start ridiculing him at every launch or premiere of a movie of the horror genre.I mean, what is he doing?.Does he ever come to know what the audiences think about his horror films produced or directed by him and what the audiences actually want?.People go inside the hall and literally make fun of the characters and the movie.What chill and what thrill is he talking about? His thoughts and assumptions are going in the wrong direction.he expects us to be afraid..well we are not but instead embarrassed.\n\nTalking about phoonk, the movie was a poor one.The storyline had nothing special and exciting.The usage of background music was pathetic according to the film sequences. The film had the typical Ram Gopal Verma elements of the typical ghostly faces and sounds and also the boring creepy atmosphere that was created. The movie had the same lame and boring atmospheric elements as that of Vaastu Shastra, Bhoot, Darna Zaroori Hai and Raat. Audiences can just whistle and tease and take the interest away during the movie.The cinematography with the camera-work was awful and disgusting.RGv wants to scare us but he needs to find new ways.Gone are the days of Raat and other ghost films like Dayyam in which he had some success.He really needs to look up to some Hollywood or Japanese movies and get some inspiration from them if he can&apos;t deliver it on his own and there is nothing wrong in it.Every good director gets inspired by Hollywood films and does copy the style because in the end what matters is the audience entertainment. If not watch Hollywood movies then read some good books or Ghost stories by some very famous authors and make a movie on that but not this. The performances given by the actors couldn&apos;t really help the story and the direction and instead made things worse. There comes a time when one begins to feel embarrassed after spending even only 30 bucks for the show after the taunts in the hall.The child artists cannot be blamed as direction was poor. The story didn&apos;t have much to really set a chilling effect.Faces made along with sounds were just boring.Mr Verma ..wake up...Do make Horror movies.. We need them but change the style. The horror genre of films are soon starting to disappear from the Indian Film Industry.We need quality stuff and if movies like phoonk and vaastu are made time and time again then we can all really stop going to movie theaters.",

Enter a very French tale about the future imperfect, amounting to more or less an environmental horror yarn evoking those 1970s nature run amuck flicks. The cinematography and editing grab and grip, especially the intro, vibrating almost with a sense of January 6 chaos. But as the tale reveals it&apos;s a survive-if-you-can story of fractured family amid a fractured world and Mother Nature will have her day on Anvers! Or something. The narrative traipses plausible ish, and the effects come across as not so unbelievable. My kingdom for a concrete bunker already!",

Bill Murray owes Anderson a debt of gratitude for reviving his career and Anderson owes Murray for bringing some heavyweight comedic talent to his film and putting him on the map. Rushmore is definitely weird, but ultimately sweet and rewarding.",

What caught me was the wicked story and how they really make it seem possible. I can imagine that this has taken place in a small church somewhere on the danish countryside. The dialouge is great, tons of punchlines that bubbles up the day after or even weeks after you have seen the film.",

It was titled &quot;Why men don&apos;t listen and women can&apos;t parallel park.&quot; A good movie, both funny and scarily poignant. If you get a chance, watch it. A combination mocumentry and situational comedy, with some good performances. If you liked &quot;Amelie&quot; this is worth a shot. An exaggeration of real life, but I guarantee these characters will remind you of someone you know. Subtitled, obviously. So if you are one of those people who thinks all the best movies, actors and directors speak English, skip it and put in another inane Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler movie. I look forward to it coming out on DVD and will be purchasing it.",

      "reviewBody": "The opening scene of this movie can tell you how the whole film will be like: strange, hypnotic, visually stunning, sometimes disturbing, and powerful. This film is about gangsters in Berlin after WWII. It is mesmerizing, and makes me want to see it again and again after it ends. Though I cannot quite understand the whole story of this movie after viewing it for only one time, its atmosphere really entrances me. The atmosphere is strange and has something undescribable about it, something which is unfamiliar and really makes this movie stand out from other movies. And I think its atmosphere corresponds very well with the mental state of the characters.  Besides its superb visual quality, the use of plane noises in this movie is quite interesting and very effective. Moreover, there is a sense of discontinuity running throughout the whole film. It seems like some scenes which might have been important to other mainstream films are deemed unnecessary here, and they are indeed unnecessary. To make a movie full of discontinuities might not be difficult, but in this movie, the feeling of discontinuity seems to fit in very well, seems very appropriate, seems so right, and I think to make a movie like this requires a real great talent. The feeling of discontinuity strongly enhances that undescribable atmosphere and makes the movie much more exciting to watch. Furthermore, it is worth noticing that not only some scenes are appropriately left out, but something which would normally have been the focus of the scene is sometimes curiously missing.\n\nAs for the performance, Katharina Thalbach has a suitable and memorable role here. The actor who plays Gladow also gives a stunning performance. I have heard that the film is based on a true story, but I think its style, feelings, and power are unique, and quite different from other movies based on a true story.  In my opinion, this movie is not only a `must-see&apos;, but a `must-see-at-least-twice.&apos;"

      "reviewBody": "The downfall of Germanys &quot;Iron Chancellor&quot; Bismarck (Emil Jannings), who had to resign from his position just two years after Wilhelm II. (then just 29 years old) became Emperor of the Reich. The film depicts the clash between the unexperienced and notoriously narcissistic Wilhelm II. and Bismarck, who basically had ruled the country all by himself since 1871, while Wilhelm&apos;s grandfather, Wilhelm I., had basically been a merely symbolical figure in the background.\n\nDespite of what has often been written about this film, there is just a few National-Socialist propaganda in it - at least in the DVD-version I was able to see, which may have been cut. In one scene Bismarck explains to Wilhelm that the social problems of the country can only be solved by a &quot;socialism from above&quot;, a &quot;socialism&quot; which at the same time must be &quot;national&quot;. Another scene shows Bismarck confronting the Social Democrats at the Reichstag, among them his arch-adversary August Bebel. Bebel was Jewish, and another Jewish social-democratic member of the Reichstag (Paul Singer) makes a brief and decidedly unappealing appearance. Otherwise the film does not stress the Jewishness of the Social Democrats, at least not in the possibly edited version available.\n\nApart from that the film is basically a patriotic epic in the vein of D.W. Griffith&apos;s ABRAHAM LINCOLN. As usual in historical biopics, actions are simplified, condensed and dramatized, but overall DIE ENTLASSUNG is historically pretty accurate - and surprisingly complex for a nationalistic film shot within the system of the Third Reich. Some liberties have been taken, but they don&apos;t change the historical connection of the events much. There are many little details that only those with a good knowledge of Bismarck&apos;s life and the feud between him and Wilhelm will recognize. It is not true what another commentator wrote, that Wilhelm is presented with both of his arms intact. Note how he always keeps his left arm hidden in the coat or behind the back.\n\nTo non-German commentators the main significance of the story may be lost: the tragedy is not only about the fall of Bismarck and the futility of his lifework but also of the Second Reich which was his creation. The arrogance and ignorance of the young Kaiser and the manipulations of the intriguers (great: Werner Krauss) at the court prevent the renewal of a friendship pact between Germany and Russia, a centerpiece of Bismarck&apos;s diplomacy. The film is absolutely historically correct here. This failure proved to be fatal, as Russia found new allies in England and France which lead to the constellation of 1914, exactly the two-front-war that Bismarck tried to avoid. Thus the ending of the film is not &quot;bizarre&quot; at all - but in order to make it less fatalistic as it could have been, the bad guy Krauss gets a deserved bashing by Bismarck, after which a dissolve switches the scenery to the famous Bismarck monument build in 1906 in Hamburg. Being a war-time film under a nationalist regime the film needed some appeal to heroism in the end, covering up the more darker and pessimistic implications of the story.\n\nTypical for the quality films of the Third Reich, DIE ENTLASSUNG relies on set-pieces and excellent acting rather than on cutting and camera work. The screenplay is by the Austrian writer Alexander Lernet-Holenia, who in fact was a conservative opponent to the Nazis. Jannings and Krauss give great performances, which make THE ENTLASSUNG indeed a far better film than its prequel BISMARCK.",

      "name": "DAUGHTER OF DECEIT (Luis Bunuel, 1951) ***",
      "reviewBody": "Although this might be a minor genre movie from Luis Bunuel&apos;s Mexican period and, in fact, I had rated it half-a-star less upon first viewing three years ago at London&apos;s NFT retrospective, I found myself repeatedly laughing so hard this time around that I decided to boost my opinion of it from an &quot;above-average&quot; to a &quot;good&quot; one. But that is Bunuel for you and, actually, one of the main reasons why he is my all-time favorite film-maker bar none – because, no matter how serious the themes he is rigorously treating in any particular work (poverty, adultery, prostitution, etc.), he never sentimentalizes them and takes care to entertain and enlighten his audience at one and the same time.\n\nThe storyline is pretty simple: a small-time businessman with perennially misfiring schemes dodges the constant nagging of his wife through his frequent traveling; however, when one night his train is delayed on account of a landslide, he returns home to find the latter in the arms of his best friend. In the ensuing fracas, so as not to take it away from her, she tells him that he is not the father of their child – which leads the enraged man to vindictively dump the baby onto the doorstep of the town drunk! Cut to twenty years later (via the ingeniously economical transition of opening and closing a cupboard) and the girl – who has blossomed into a good-looking woman – seeks to escape the beatings of her foster parent and, inadvertently causing a traffic accident during one of her flights from home, proceeds to fall for her handsome &apos;road victim&apos; (played by Ruben Rojo, in a similar role to the one he had had in Bunuel&apos;s 1949 comedy THE GREAT MADCAP). Her stepsister is a feisty girl with a mind to becoming first an actress and then a chanteuse in a cabaret; this desire eventually brings her into the businessman&apos;s locale (amusingly named &quot;L&apos;Infierno&quot;) – cue a non-gratuitous musical number which not only brings the two siblings together again but also paves the way for the proverbial happy ending in store for everybody (once all the considerable and long-standing misunderstandings have been sorted out) as father and daughter are finally reunited once again. Indeed, in this movie, it is the home environment which breeds distress and pain while, contrary to the norm, it is within the confines of a nightclub that moral wrongs are righted.\n\nWhat promises to be simply a routine and bland melodrama for women is transformed by Bunuel&apos;s deftness for comedy in a well-crafted, very entertaining and unpretentious little movie. Portraying the father as a larger-than-life figure the likes of which Anthony Quinn would virtually make a career out of in a few years, Fernando Soler – already twice a star for Bunuel in THE GREAT MADCAP and SUSANA (1951) – becomes a veritable nihilist with the passage of time, forever losing his temper with everybody at the slightest provocation To counter this boorish character, Bunuel gives a free hand to his two bumbling (but occasionally ingenious) henchmen perfectly essayed by Fernando &quot;Mantequilla&quot; Soto (who later co-starred in Bunuel&apos;s picaresque 1954 film, ILLUSION TRAVELS BY STREETCAR) and Nacho Contla (as a character named Jonron, a broken English rendition of his favorite catchphrase, &quot;Home Run&quot;!). While these two start out as antagonists – the former a bouncer/croupier and the latter a gun-toting, shamelessly cheating gambler – in a hilariously ineffective confrontation early on in the film, they eventually become buddies when hired (and, subsequently, slave-driven) by their anguished employer Soler to seek out his missing daughter. Before long, however, they start devising cleverly funny schemes with which to deceive their boss into believing that they had been &quot;running across half of Mexico&quot; in hot pursuit of their quarry...when actually they had been eating and drinking their time away! \n\nHaving said that, the dramatic stages of the movie – a couple breaking up and the father unknowingly humiliating his daughter when they meet again many years later – reminded me of two Josef von Sternberg movies – respectively BLONDE VENUS (1932) and THE SHANGHAI GESTURE (1941); the gambling subtext here is also another connection to the latter. Even if Bunuel never really enjoyed the same reputation as a visual stylist like that Austrian émigré, I must say that I was impressed (and surprised) by how exceedingly well lit this film was. Speaking of Austrian auteurs, the fact that Bunuel had already been involved in adapting the same source novel &quot;Don Quintin The Bitter&quot; for the screen back in his native Spain in 1935 (there was even a 1925 Silent) and only got to make his own version long afterwards (shot in just 20 days and released on my own mother&apos;s sixth birthday!) equates it with a similar occurrence in his own cinematic idol&apos;s career i.e Fritz Lang&apos;s epic Indian diptych of 1958-59, which had already been filmed as THE Indian TOMB in 1921 (by Joe May), and further remade by other hands in the interim (in 1938)! Actually, the new title DAUGHTER OF DECEIT is a misnomer since the wife swears the girl is Soler&apos;s anyway; in fact, it would have done better to keep the original one since Don Quintin is clearly the protagonist of the piece.",

      "reviewBody": "..and however,she&apos;s leaving home,at least mentally.\n\n&quot;Family life&quot; is the most difficult,the most austere of all Kenneth Loach&apos;s efforts.One should add it&apos;s also his most dated.The generation gap,with these &quot;boys and daughters who are beyond your command&quot;,all this looks like hippie relics.As do the mother&apos;s wailings:the youth is not what it used to be,they don&apos;t show respect anymore,they make love all day when they&apos;re not taking drugs etc.The generation gap is not typically sixties or early seventies.It&apos;s an all-time problem:For instance,Elia Kazan&apos;s &quot;East of Eden&quot; was made in 1954,and the action takes place circa 1914.So a lot of stuff at the beginning of &quot;Family life&quot; deals with clichés.\n\nNevertheless,this movie is a must if you like the &quot;European &quot; style.Its form is absolutely unique,looking like a special report,a survey,with question/answer dialogues galore.At times,we wonder whether the actors are actually playing.We&apos;re close to &quot;cinema verite&quot; (see JL Godard&apos;s &quot;masculin feminin&quot; (1966))A viewer who would turn the TV on halfway through the movie,might think he&apos;s watching a documentary film.\n\nJanice is a rather normal young woman,with normal problems.she had a hard time of it when she had an abortion .Her mother is a puritan,rigid,and probably frigid woman,her father is a &quot;honor and duty&quot; man.Both content themselves with a routine nine-to-five life,and they are convinced that they are good parents.The father is proud of the clock his bosses have given to him,after 25 years of hard work,the mother of her jelly.\n\nJanice is some kind of misfit,and she&apos;s not unlike the main character from &quot;la tête contre les murs&quot;(George Franju,1958).But there&apos;s a huge difference:Franju tells a story,Loach does not.No dramatization at all in the English director&apos;s film.There is a similar scene in the two movies:both inmates escape ,take refuge in their girl/boyfriend&apos;s flat,then the police come:Franju&apos;s character is desperate,revolted,Janice is already a zombie,she cannot react anymore.\n\nA lot of people said the shrinks were caricatures in &quot;family life&quot;:completely true as far the last one is concerned.But the first one ,on the other hand ,sees well:three times,he asks the father if his sexual relations are satisfying ,and every time he tries to change the subject.\n\nKenneth Loach has come a long way from the documentary style of &quot;poor cow&quot;(1967) and &quot;family life&quot;.It&apos;s interesting to note that the movie midway between ,&quot;Kes&quot; (1969),is more accessible,being more storybook.During the eighties and nineties,with such works as &quot;hidden agenda&quot; and the wonderful &quot;carla&apos;s song&quot;,Kenneth Loach will prove he can be a story teller too."

After a big promotional campaign and not that bad scores on IMDb (normally quite accurate)I felt it would be worth the couple of bucks this would cost.\n\nO my GOD. It is not even worth one cent.\n\nAs so many times before in dutch TV and Cinema the old trick of casting some young soap actors and/ or (local music television) presenters has been used to promote this movie. Mostly they have no talent what so ever. Take Johnny the Mol. He is the Dutch Torry Spelling. Father is a billionaire TV producer. But he can not act to safe his live. As a fact I have not ever seen any talents in this kid what so ever. Still he is very popular with young girls and some young boys I am sure.\n\nSo someone is pushing the right buttons.\n\nI must say that this also did work for this movie. It has been all over the press. -Must be some good PR team for this one, maybe the same as Johhny?.- Anyway. The story, the actors, the dialog the, plot, the effects, the directing is all so cheesy you will not believe. I could not bare it for longer than an hour.\n\nIf you buy or want to watch this movie anyway. Be prepared to be disappointed. For this will happen. &quot;Vet Hard&quot; zelfs and that&apos;s a guarantee.\n\nIf you do watch this movie. And hate it, as I did. Please help to spare others the disappointment and vote. Also give input for the reviews that are honest and not from the producers and other makers. \n\nFor in my mind there is no other possibility than this for some of the good reviews up here.",

      "name": "Sullen Groucho Fans Are Smearing a Funny Film",
      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been a die-hard Marxist for several years now. After I watched their first seven films to the point where my tapes were in tatters, I sought out their later films, the lesser productions Room Service thru Night in Casablanca. After that, I still wanted more, so I finally gave in and watched the one film that I KNEW would be painful: Love Happy. Virtually every review has smeared this film and ripped into it with full claws, so I braced myself and bought the DVD.\n\nNow let me tell you something: this movie is great. Of course it&apos;s not in the ballpark of the Paramounts, but it fits nicely with their later films, and is a real delight. So why the negative rap? Well, this movie was originally intended as a solo vehicle for Harpo Marx. Chico joined on when he needed money to get out of debt. Groucho was never supposed to be in this film, but the sponsors said that they wouldn&apos;t release it unless he was, so that they could bill it as a &quot;Marx Brothers&quot; picture. So footage of Groucho narrating parts of the story were shoehorned into the finished product. The result? Chico and Harpo are just as enchanting as ever, and Groucho--despite being displayed prominently on the movie posters--is relegated to a commentator. Since most Marx fans are Groucho fans first, Chico/Harpo fans second, this setup comes as a slap in the face, and the film gets trashed.\n\nAs such, if you watch the Marxes mainly to see Groucho&apos;s witty quips, this movie will bore you stiff. However, if you--like me--love the others just as much as Groucho (for me, Chico will ALWAYS be the funniest Marx Brother!) you&apos;ll be surprised at how good Love Happy really is. I&apos;d go into the plot, but with a Marx movie, who really cares about the plot? It&apos;s our boys we&apos;re after. Chico plays an uproarious piano/violin duet, lusts after Ilona Massey, has some &quot;tootsy-frootsy ice cream&quot; and does some flawed mind-reading; Harpo tumbles through a washing machine, turns his fingers into candles, pulls a dog out of his coat and lusts after Ilona Massey. And Groucho narrates, searches, quips, ponders the situation, and...lusts after Ilona Massey. Oh!--and did I mention this film started the career of a young Marilyn Monroe? \n\nIn short, to a Chico/Harpo fan, this movie is as good as (and often better than) At the Circus or A Night in Casablanca. To a Groucho fan...well, that&apos;s why we have remote-controls.",

      "reviewBody": "That scene in the car. That scene brought back every hope and dream I could remember as a 15 year old in love with a girl in my class I would never have. It was a validation of all those wonderful daydreams you had at that age and the hope that sprung from them. It was a moment that would send that pang in your heart to heights it&apos;s never known.\n\nYou&apos;re never in love like you are at that age - and when you watch a film like this where you can become so completely involved in the life and emotions of a girl like Agnes - and see her greatest hope realized after a day of humiliation and pain - your heart soars. In fact, I can&apos;t think of a moment in a movie that is as perfect as this one.\n\nThere&apos;s a universal quality to the feelings this film evokes that will pull in everyone who has a heart. I&apos;m many years beyond high school - and of the opposite sex of the two protagonists in the film - and I still can&apos;t help but identify completely with this movie. Much of this has to do with the two actresses in the lead roles. Where did this director find these two phenomenal actresses? Rebecca Liljeberg has such a quiet and powerful range. Watching her react to other characters is one of the great pleasures of this film. Alexandra Dahlström takes a role that, in anyone else&apos;s hands would be either shallow or unbearable, and makes a character so complete, beautifully vulnerable and full of life you can understand why everyone loves her. These two girls - they are so wonderful, expressive and real you just want to hug them. \n\nI saw this film when it came to New York, loved it then when i saw it once during what seemed like only a two week run, then recently remembered it and rented it. I have seen it 5 times since and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll see it many times more. It is a film that transcends gender, sexual orientation and age. \n\nAnd for all you English language folks out there (I&apos;m one of you), the subtitles will not be a drawback. In fact, watching this film in it&apos;s native language brings you even closer to these characters when you realize how familiar life is as a human being, no matter where we&apos;re from. How much we all have in common when it comes to matters of the heart. It&apos;s a nice little extra to be reminded of, since it&apos;s something we sometimes tend to forget.\n\nMy praise cannot be more genuine, heartfelt and complete. Get this film. Your day will be made by it. You&apos;ll be telling your friends about it. In a busy life where there&apos;s a lot of distraction, you&apos;ll remember for a moment how wonderful it is to be alive and in love - and how that&apos;s worth everything in the world.",

How about the great black actress Louise Beavers, whose entrance in the film is a scream (I&apos;ll say no more, lest I ruin it). It&apos;s a witty piece of art deco comedy, with Tashman and Francis as ermine-caped gold diggers, and Eugene Palette (not quite yet obese) and handsome Joel McCrea as the latest targets. Like so many Paramount films of the early 30s, its still fresh and contemporary, thanks to its grown up, pre-Code script. And those opening credits--couples dancing over the new york skyline--just icing on the cake. Don&apos;t miss this.",

      "reviewBody": "Watched the complete movie recently &amp; loved the simple yet engaging story. The way they covered poor &amp; middle class section of India in 90s is commendable. It looked so real mostly because of wonderful screenplay &amp; brilliant performances by all the actors. It&apos;s really hard to believe it was Shahrukh khan&apos;s first movie. So sad to see the industry only offered him useless rom-coms &amp; masala movies in his following career. Juhi Chawla was natural &amp; real &amp; all her scenes with Shahrukh were effortless. Today&apos;s female actors need to learn real acting doesn&apos;t only mean hitting hard lines with no make-up but also look effortless in throwing simple lines. Amrita singh played her part so well &amp; so did Nana Patekar. Music was an asset &amp; most songs were there as per situation. Overall this movie was way better than 90s masala movies which took over later decade.",

      "reviewBody": "Fantastic and amusing adventures full of monsters in lost continent by Kevin Connor and based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs . At the beginning of the film , during World War I , a German submarine sinks a Brit boat and takes the survivors on board. The submarine takes them to the unknown land of Antartica called Caprona . At the sub are reunited the U-boat German captain (John McEnery) piloting his ship along with Owen Tyler (Doug McClure) and Lisa (Susan Penhaligon) , among others . The group takes a wrong turn and descend over a barren land and meet some primitive men , Neardentals and prehistoric animals . They have to deal with numerous risks, dangers, endure torrential landslide, shakesands, volcano, cavemen warriors, dinosaurs and discover a lost tribe .\n\nThis engaging adaptation is a special version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs adventure yarn . There are rip-roaring action, spirit of adventure, derring-do, thrills, and results to be quite entertaining. It&apos;s a brief fun with average special effects , passable set decoration , functional art direction and none use of computer generator. This fantasy picture packs thrills, action, weird monsters, lively pace and fantastic scenarios . The monsters are the real stars of this production and its chief attribute. The tale is silly and laughable but the effects and action are quite well. Among the most spectacular of its visuals there are a Pterodactilus roaring menacingly towards the camera, a little tableau comprising attack of a giant monsters and the colorful backgrounds of the lost land . Some monsters are clumsily made but movie is OK . Highlights of the adventure includes a roller-coaster trip towards unknown land in South America , and appearance of prehistoric reptile such as Pterodactilus, Stegosaurius, and Tiranosaurious . In addition the final scenes where appears breathtaking volcanic eruptions and thunderous explosions . Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by Roger Dicken&apos;s monsters, though sometimes are a little bit cheesy. Filmed in glimmer cinematography by Alan Hume on location in Santa Cruz De La Palma , Tenerife(Canary Islands) and Shepperton studios , Surrey England . Adequate and stirring musical score by Douglas Gamley. This one turns out to be an acceptable collaboration between producers Milton Subotsky , Max Rosemberg and director Kevin Connor who also made in similar style : ¨All the Earth&apos;s core(76)¨, ¨Warlord of Atlantis(1978)¨, mostly starred by Doug McClure and with Dicken as the monster-maker. It&apos;s followed by ¨People that time forgot¨ in which an expedition undergoing a trip in search for Tyler (Doug McClure) who has been missing in that region for many years . The film will appeal to kids who swallow whole and sit convulsed in their armchair.",

Art should speak for itself, reviews are not diatribes.\n\nIt&apos;s a testament to the continued ignorance and emotionally shallowness of the majority (even at IMDb that is an IQ/eq click over the median) that decent films get sub par ratings, and atrocious ones get good ones. That said it&apos;s always heartening to see that an informed minority (who&apos;s voted 30/45 on another reviewer&apos;s positive review) has got the sense and the sensibility (to paraphrase one of the loveliest wordplays ever) to appreciate good films within their differing opinions of taste, background, world view, frame of mind.\n\nThis is one of those films that is actually quite good, yet you &apos;d never know that from the rating or some reviews here. First of all we have an excellent cast of seasoned actors giving fine, tempered performances, not overdone, not understated, just fine tuned performances all around. So the drama or the twists aren&apos;t spectacular, so what? There&apos;s plenty of humanity here and emotion to keep one&apos;s interest. A special vote to Kim Basinger who isn&apos;t getting the recognition she deserves, she&apos;s adorable here and she&apos;s grown to be a splendid actress, despite the ensemble cast the real star here is her. All in all a very sweet film."

In our story, Annie (Gerry) and Jeanne (Fonda) and three more seniors decide to move in together to look after one another. And student Kirk will study them. And, as expected, that brings its own set of problems. Big fights over installing a pool. Will anyone get to use it? Cute ending. Very well done. No big surprises, but some fun moments. Written and directed by Stéphane Robelin. Showing on roku channel.",

She befriends base commander (R. Lee Ermey)&apos;s wild daughter Jenn Platt (Christine Elise). She falls for chopper pilot Tim Young (Billy Wirth). There are strange things happening and Maj. Collins (Forest Whitaker) asks Steve if it could be chemical toxins. Military personnel delivers mysterious boxes to the Malones. Carol is the first to turn.\n\nThe major drawback is that the premise is known to everybody. There is no surprises except for the sci-fi uninitiated. The bathtub scene is pretty good although it&apos;s nothing shocking. This is a solid execution. The army base location is pretty good. Body snatchers can be camouflaged by being stoic soldiers and they are pretty creepy. There is nothing wrong with this version but it adds nothing new to the idea.",

      "reviewBody": "There is not one category in which I can rate this movie positively... but I&apos;ll try anyway.\n\nPlot: Nope. Other posters have beaten this one to death. \n\nMilitary accuracy: My ROTC friend kept screaming that the Special Forces guys were using the wrong guns. He also tells me that the Navy doesn&apos;t use F-16s. I&apos;ll take his word on all that. I was annoyed at the clumsy way in which the alleged elite troops crouch-walked towards the hostile gunmen near the airport. Also, the fact that a White House fund raiser was authorized to make decisions involving missile strikes on civilians rather bothered me.\n\nPhysical accuracy: This just totally lost me. The plane didn&apos;t depressurize, nor did oxygen masks deploy, when the window blew out (a good half hour after it was shot, mind you). The CGI plane kept pitching and yawing at angles that can&apos;t happen. The shooters would frequently aim at other things (like the floor), yet their targets would fall back, shot in places only a magic bullet could reach. The list goes on.\n\nActing: Ha. The generic terrorists, who spoke perfectly articulated English, were so boring in their desires that I often wondered why they were even bothering. The &quot;scared passengers&quot; were more annoyed than anything, which made their presence annoying to the viewers. And Mr. Shirtless Dean Cain Wannabe was just sad. \n\nFight sequences: Competent stage acting, better than some films I&apos;ve seen, but in no way what you&apos;d call &quot;good.&quot; \n\nPlane realities: All wrong. I like how the pilot was from the school of flying that teaches top speed landings, without wing flaps, and while pointing the nose down. The internal layout of the plane did not come close to matching the external CGI shell. The hurricane-sized storm they fly through takes all of a minute and a half to get through. The speed at which they are tracked on the map (using a transponder that was shut off) is ludicrously fast. And I&apos;m sorry, but the ability to land a prop lane in an IMac flight simulator should not convey any skill to pilot a commercial jet.\n\nSequels: Okay, so this is the one area that I can say something good. There is no sequel to Air Marshal. However, there are other films in the American Heroes series to which Air Marshal belongs."

      "reviewBody": "The girls reunite after their first year of college. Tibby Rollins (Amber Tamblyn) is studying filmmaking at NYU and has to go back for summer school. She&apos;s with Brian and they have a scare. Bridget Vreeland (Blake Lively) is playing soccer at Brown and she finds letters from her estranged grandmother Greta (Blythe Danner). She goes to a dig in Turkey for the summer. Lena Kaligaris (Alexis Bledel) is on scholarship at Rhode Island School of Design. Lena is surprised to find Kostas married with a child on the way. She falls for Leo (Jesse Williams) and then Kostas come back into her life. Carmen Lowell (America Ferrera) hates that everybody seems to be moving on including her mother. She&apos;s working backstage while at Yale. Actress Julia Beckwith (Rachel Nichols) invites her to Vermont to an acting retreat as backstage crew. She declines at first until the other girls tell her about their other plans. The workshop play is directed by Bill Kerr (Kyle MacLachlan). Leading actor Ian takes an interest and Carmen is cast as the lead. In a fit of spite, Lena&apos;s sister Effie (Lucy Hale) takes the pants but loses them in Greece.\n\nThis movie has the same charms and the same problems as the first movie. The goodness in this series are the girls and their friendships. Their trials and tribulations are soapy but compelling although the movie may be too overstuffed with soap opera. The actresses are all terrific. Once again, the problem is that the girls are separated for most of the movie. Their group chemistry is diffused. Of course, the whole point of the series is that the pants connect them as they go off on their own. It&apos;s impossible to keep them together for long without losing the whole premise. In the end, this is a nice coming-of-age franchise for girls.",

Meanwhile, his set-ups lead to many disappointments and disaster dates. It also causes him trouble with his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) who eventually breaks up with him. This movie is so predictable it hurts. There are so many dead-giveaways to the ending that even I could predict it. (Tee-hee.) Besides a few almost-humorous moments, this movie is boring, lifeless, and mediocre. The performances are OK, however there is no real chemistry between the characters and we don&apos;t get to see much character development. I swear, if it weren&apos;t for that adorable Matt Dillon, I would never watch this movie."

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;d never heard of this movie until my buddy Eric rented it; that Blockbuster carries it is I guess a good sign. Part Crouching Tiger,  part Saving Private Ryan,  with just a smidgen of Hidden Fortress and an echo of Xenophon, Musa is a highly enjoyable movie.\n\nThe movie begins in 1375 with a failed delegation from Korea to the Ming dynasty. Led by General Choi Jung (Jin-mo Ju), the delegation become prisoners of the Ming, being led off to exile, when the Mongols strike. Suddenly finding themselves free, the delegation decides to rescue the captive Ming princess (Ziyi Zhang, of Crouching Tiger fame) who travels with the Mongols. When they succeed, naturally, the Mongols want her back, and thus begins an arduous trek across the desert, culminating in a Road Warrior-esque fight at a battered old castle where the survivors hole up against their much more mobile but less-civilized attackers.\n\nMusa has action in spades, some of it exceptionally grisly (every archery attack is cause for dozens of shots of gruesome impalings). The battles are tense and tautly filmed and feel more dangerous than most combats of this type. We eschew the beautiful martial arts style so prevalent in many Hong Kong films for a grittier and far more realistic, if a bit bloody, style here.  But what Musa also possesses is atmosphere; the locations and the cinematography are top-notch, from the boundless deserts to the broken-down castle by the sea. Musa does an excellent job of selling the world it is set in.\n\nThe costumes help with this as well. Not since Brotherhood of the Wolf have I seen such elaborate and effective costuming (the armor and such here was even more intricate and character-intensive than Last Samurai, which is saying something). Each character has his own particular look, is easily told apart from the others, and costuming is ultimately an extension of character, which to me has always been the whole point. These are some of the best period costumes you&apos;ll see anywhere.\n\nThe acting is all pretty good, though it tends to come from the George Lucas school of `faster, more intense.&apos; One facet I did like is that no one is perfect; the general is a bit of a jerk; his loyal retainer Ga-nam (Jeong-Hak Park), while a mighty warrior, lacks the ability to really think for himself; the princess is spoiled; the slave-turned-warrior Yeo-sol (Woo-sung Jung) is selfless but headstrong, and so on. Even the Mongols come across as human, if a bit savage (which, having done the research, I can attest is more or less pretty accurate).\n\nMusa isn&apos;t for everyone due to the violence. But it&apos;s a very well done period piece with wonderful visuals that certainly captivates the viewer. It&apos;s as good or better than any of the historical epics Hollywood has released in the past few years (with the exception of The Last Samurai), and from a costuming and cinematography sense is very much worth your while to see. Just don&apos;t bother tracking this down if you&apos;re a little squeamish, that&apos;s all.",

      "reviewBody": "Being an arty psychological puzzle - and one which might well be not just incomprehensible but also meaningless - I&apos;d always been interested in checking this film out; the fact that it was a critical and box-office failure made it doubly fascinating. Still, what must have seemed like the turkey of the year when new has, with time, acquired a certain charm all its own! On the surface, the film is certainly good-looking (shot by Billy Williams in numerous European locations, mainly a sunny Greek island) and boasts a fine score by Johnny Dankworth (which, in keeping with the film&apos;s theme, seems oddly unsuited to what&apos;s going on); the star cast responds competently to the mystifying plot (structured like a Chinese box - where past events are constantly re-enacted, identities exchanged and, of course, nothing is what it seems). Still, while Anthony Quinn may be everybody&apos;s idea of a Greek larger-than-life character, here he is saddled with an unbecoming Picasso hairstyle and, underneath it all, Michael Caine may well have been mirroring the bewilderment felt by his character since, in his autobiography, he singles out THE MAGUS as his worst film ever (though I personally would beg to differ and choose THE ISLAND [1980] for that unenviable spot)! \n\nActually, it all reminded me of L&apos;INVENZIONE DI MOREL (1974) - another obscure island-set drama where a man intrudes upon a remote community sharing an exclusive fantasy existence: incidentally, that film was partly shot in my native country and also featured Anna Karina (who in THE MAGUS has the rather thankless role of Caine&apos;s jilted girlfriend - though her performance is quite good and his callous treatment of Karina has a strong bearing on the main character&apos;s ultimate personal growth) as the mystery woman who captivates the hero; with this in mind, as I lay watching the film under review, I wondered at the possibilities had Karina exchanged her role with that of Candice Bergen (who&apos;s too young for her role but great to look at nonetheless).\n\nThen again, the subject matter was far more congenial to a Joseph Losey rather than the journeyman Guy Green...and one can only surmise how different - and more significant - the film would have been in the former&apos;s hands! As it stands, there are some undeniably compelling passages but also a lot of shallow modishness (the skin-flick with Bergen and Julian Glover[!] at the climax is plain risible) and lame moralizing (the WWII flashback scenes, featuring a bizarrely but effectively cast Corin Redgrave as the Nazi Commandant, being especially maudlin).\n\nAt several points towards the end, it feels like the story is coming to some sort of conclusion but it just goes on and on, peeling off yet another layer to the meandering enigma; to get an inkling of what the film is like, just imagine watching two of the more cerebral episodes of the cult TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967-68) back-to-back! In hindsight, the film&apos;s epitaph may have been delivered by none other than Woody Allen who once remarked that, if he had to live his life all over again, he would do everything exactly the same...except watch THE MAGUS. As for myself, I wouldn&apos;t mind taking another look at it in future: by then I&apos;d be over the initial &quot;shock&quot; and could perhaps appreciate it better...",

Sadly that&apos;s the only time it had my attention for a good reason, I had a chip on my shoulder for the entire film because of the themes.\n\nWithout spoilers the core theme is girl loves boy, boy loves girl bad boy who is a horrible character with no redeeming features and is presented as an arrogant tool throughout comes along, girl cheats on boy with dirtbag and that&apos;s actually a love story. You think that&apos;s the setup for a story of forgiveness and redemption? Nope, that is the story.\n\nWho is this for? A love triangle featuring two scumbags and the victim caught in it all. The film actually made me angry that this is not only the way it played out but also that this was presented as love and romance. One reviewer&apos;s title is talking about when you find love you need to hold onto it, whereas this film is about the literal opposite.\n\nDisgusting film, I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this.\n\nRants\n\nWho has been cheated on here? Raise your hand. I&apos;m betting if you&apos;re reading this you have been. Do you think your ex (Hopefully you had the good sense to walk away) could be constituted as a the good guy in that story? No, cheaters are scum in every sense of the word. Don&apos;t want to be with someone? Don&apos;t be with them, but don&apos;t break their heart and don&apos;t make movies where the heartbreaker is made out to be a good person and the theme to be about &quot;Love&quot;.\n\nBreakdown\n\nGreat soundtrack Solid cast Awful premise Dreadful characters.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;45365&quot; has far better images and sound and editing than I&apos;ve come to expect from documentaries. In fact cinematography is one of its strongest characteristics. All the images are very high resolution. The viewer is left wondering how they did that when the whole screen fills with a gorgeous nature shot. Color depth is significant too - a shot of subtle shifts in the color of the light as clouds pass overhead could easily look washed out and boring in another film, but it comes through here. Watch this film in a theater or projected or at least on the biggest baddest HD screen you can find; if you just watch it on a TV-in-a-box, you&apos;ll miss a big part of what it&apos;s all about.\n\nI found the editing and cutting to be pretty quick and effective. I was never tempted to sink back into my popcorn and ignore the screen for a while. Then again, I&apos;m nearly sixty and my motor probably runs slower than yours and I&apos;ve sat through some really sllooowwww films. This film is not a borefest of interest only to cineasts - but many won&apos;t find it gripping either.\n\nLots of different ideals of what a &quot;documentary&quot; is are associated with lots of different styles of film-making. The particular kind of documentary motivating this film avoids any kind of analysis like the plague. It goes even further, trying to have no Point Of View at all. No POV means no story line nor plot in the traditional sense, and no resolution of any kind. It&apos;s unfair though to say the film shows only the &quot;good parts&quot; of small town life. Weird and fraying and busted relationships are shown. Legal and illegal drug use and alcoholism are shown. Crushing boredom leading to escapism is shown. People are shackled for their court appearance and face jail time. What&apos;s not shown --nor even commented on obliquely-- is either &quot;why&quot; people behave this way or whether a &quot;significant&quot; proportion of the population is affected.\n\nThe film helps you imagine life in a small town. What it doesn&apos;t do is give you it&apos;s opinion of whether that life would be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.",

As someone else wrote - concerns over ACTUAL birds being harmed or killed during the making of this epic. Oh yeah! No doubt about it. You can actually see a crew member&apos;s hand in one shot throwing a bird at an actor. In other scenes to make it look like the PIGEONS are swarming a victim you can see the poor things have their feet tied or stapled to the actor&apos;s costume. Sheesh! Plus you can tell the money people behind the film told the director we need nudity (check) gore (check) a long para-sailing scene with a Thompson Twins late 1980&apos;s pop sound song (check) explosion (got it) and slo-mo shots of children in danger (you betcha)!  This mess is very funny even though it doesnt mean to be. For lovers of Grade Z classics - check of BEAKS! Two Claws Up!"

      "reviewBody": "*Very Minor, Undetailed Plot Spoiler Warning* \n\nDirector D.J. Caruso has run into decent fame as of late after directing Eagle Eye, (Which I thought was pretty terrible by the way.), and the very popular Disturbia, (Which is basically a reversion of Hitchcock&apos;s classic thriller Rear Window.). However, I believe that he should be most recognized for this little gem of a film from his more distant past, 2002&apos;s The Salton Sea.\n\nOne of the greatest things about The Salton Sea is that it unravels in very unexpected ways. Wrapping up the viewer in some dark unknown mystery, that piece by piece becomes clearer and clearer as the intriguingly masked plot unfolds into a tale of drugs, dirty law enforcement, love and revenge. From the visuals, to the dialogue, from the acting, to the delivery, The Salton Sea really is a gritty, enjoyable, and somewhat unique piece of work.\n\nDon&apos;t even bother with the plot hole scenarios that some people are conjuring up out of the thin air resting between their ears. The truth is that they just didn&apos;t pay enough attention to the details while watching this underrated little diamond in the rough. If you like dark, gritty mysteries, take your mind for a dive into The Salton Sea.\n\n7/10",

      "reviewBody": "The bottom line for John Pilger&apos;s WAR ON DEMOCRACY documentary = Go See It! Then you can talk about it.\n\nI am addressing these remarks in the first place to law-abiding people, as most sharply distinguished from war criminals. The definition of a crisis = a period in which, in order to abide by that law which serves justice only, one must be prepared to enforce it. This extraordinary duty occurs because the official agencies with their names in the upper case --DoJ, DoD &amp; CIA, for example-- have been captured by a bloody tyranny which utterly perverts such basic political concepts as those of justice, defense and intelligence. (Spook HQ is now officially named the George Bush Center for Intelligence, which is located two doors down from the Wilt Chamberlain Home for Short People.) These general reflections very much pertain to the subject of Mr.Pilger&apos;s masterpiece.\n\nI speak Spanish and briefly represented the U.S. State Department in Chile in 1964 &amp; &apos;65. In its hour &amp; a half, WOD covers Latin America from El Salvador to Chile with a focus on Venezuela led by Hugo Chavez and a stop in Bolivia. For those new to this continent, WOD&apos;s an absolutely essential introduction. For those who already know it (among the group whom I&apos;m addressing, please remember), they will be overjoyed to see an intelligent and artistically coherent story of their homelands on the Big Screen. We&apos;re talking about a place more than twice the area of the USA with more than half a billion people, hundreds of millions of whom are dirt poor and many of whom have had relatives murdered by thugs trained by the US Army at the &quot;School of the Americas&quot;, which has recently changed its name out of embarrassment.\n\nWhen Pilger says that the CIA puppet regime in Guatemala slew &quot;thousands&quot;, he is grossly understating the case, since the best estimate&apos;s ~250,000. Naturally he spent more time in countries where it&apos;s safer to film. Once we understand that we should all bring everybody we know to see this movie, then we can acknowledge that it&apos;s an opening of the door to a vast realm. Many more such features need to be made even to begin to do justice to the material.\n\nA criticism: In discussion with a Chilean physician who was a torture victim, Pilger uses a phrase about being &quot;ensnared in fascism&quot;. IMHO he should simply forget the F word. As a matter of historical fact, Benito Mussolini, who created the concept of Fascism and led that Party in national power for a quarter of a century, had a lot more going for him than did the traitor Generals Rios Montt of Guatemala or Augusto Pinochet of Chile, to name only two of the dozens of US puppets in the region. The CIA&apos;s Guatemalan Genociderals in particular in their atrocities by far exceeded any acts of repression which Il Duce ever carried out in Italy. In other words, from Ronald Reagan until now the U.S. Government gives Fascism a bad name. \n\nAnyone who wants to have a head&apos;s up &apos;tude toward such a big part of our human race will definitely want to check out John Pilger&apos;s well-informed portrait of the irresistibly rising forces of the Western Hemisphere. Alert supporters of Barack Obama, Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney will want to give thought to tying in WOD to their candidates&apos; campaigns.\n\nOTOH white supremacists &amp; jingoes who think that slaughtering the families of foreigners is still cool, especially if they themselves can get a piece of the financial action, well, such &quot;Chicago boys&quot; as SonnaBush calls them in WOD, they will pan Pilger&apos;s product as skillfully as they can manage.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently watched the 1940 &quot;Shop Around the Corner&quot; with Jimmy Stewart for the first time. In explaining a synopsis to my wife she said, &quot;That sounds like the same story in &apos;You&apos;ve Got Mail.&apos;&quot; So I did my research and found out she was right. Further, I realized I had never watched this 1998 movie. So here we are, I found the DVD at my public library.\n\nThe DVD &quot;extra&quot; is also interesting, the sisters Ephron explain their approach and Hanks and Ryan pitch in also. This is a thoroughly entertaining movie.\n\nWhile it follows the same general story it is updated for the modern world. Not only is it moved from Budapest to New York, it uses the modern writing technique of email. It also uses the concept of a bigger store coming in and undercutting the smaller, long-established business.\n\nMeg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly, owner of a smaller shop, called Shop Around the Corner, specializing in children&apos;s books. Her mother was the original owner. Tom Hanks is Joe Fox of the wealthy Fox family, opening a mega bookstore around the corner from her. They meet, they develop a pretty quick dislike for each other. Unknown to both of them, they had already become email pals with very high regard for each other.\n\nSo much of this movie plays out in similar ways to the 1940 movie, it is interesting and entertaining to see how it all plays out to the end."

Sure, it&apos;s a bit silly and it plays with history and facts but it&apos;s essentially just fun and harmless yet fast moving and entertaining. Does every movie have to be The English Patient? Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger do a really good job of lite hearted comedy about a couple that keeps finding each other, over and over again! Baldwin&apos;s pals, Paul Reiser, Fisher Stevens, Peter Dobson, and Steve Hytner, are great support players as they are funny and engaging about the trials and tribulations of this love affair.\n\nRobert Logia is terrific as Baldwin&apos;s ex-fiancé&apos;s father, a power broker in Hollywood hell bent on destroying Baldwin&apos;s characters life after he jilts not once but TWICE his daughter played by Elizabeth Shue. But in many ways it is Armand Assante who steals the movie with his portrayal of Bugsy Siegel. Assante is so controlled and smooth, yet so believable as a cold blooded gangster/killer. He plays the role with a true sense of comedic timing.\n\nThe cast is first rate, the movie has some good twists and turns, and it&apos;ll go by quickly which every good movie will do. I liked it and I&apos;m betting if you like lite hearted comedy you&apos;ll like it too."

Although the director seemed intent on making more of a straight thriller (with some sleaze thrown in), it lacked in suspense and boring pacing, a prime example of a simple idea poorly executed.\n\nOkay there are a few positives about this movie such as its feels unique and eccentric in its approach which feels rather clumsy especially when it comes to the strange cast of characters such as the male lead Klaus Kinski as the therapist Peter who certainly lives up to his crazy real-life persona and a way too obvious red herring, but his performance is rather engaging. Marianna Hill as the female lead Julie is fine in her rather limited role. But Craig Wasson is a standout as the odd ex-husband and Donna Wilkes really hams things up nicely as the therapist&apos;s daughter whose also rather odd with her and the father&apos;s rather strange relationship.\n\nThe whodunnit aspect is handled rather well with a couple of twists and turns here and there, but in the end the conclusion is rather predictable yet leaves too many questions unanswered. However there are quite a few problems with this movie which could partly be down to the rather low budget, with a really cheap sounding synth score that doesn&apos;t build any tension at all. The murders aren&apos;t very memorable either and far from makes up for this movie&apos;s shortcomings.\n\nOverall only see this if you really need to, but otherwise apart its eccentricity which makes it kind of interesting, there&apos;s nothing here that wasn&apos;t done better in other far better slasher movies.",

      "reviewBody": "The Sleeping Beauty (2010) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nDirector Catherine Breillat&apos;s second straight adaptation of a Charles Perrault fairy tale. While this one here fairs much better than the previous BLUEBEARD, there&apos;s still no question that there are some problems keeping it from being a good movie. An evil witch is at the birth of a new baby girl and places a curse on her saying that she will die at the age of 16. Minutes later three good witches get on the scene and while they can&apos;t break the curse they can at least make it easier. They make it that the girl will fall asleep at the age of 6 and remain that way for one-hundred years but when she wakes up she&apos;ll still only be the age of 16. THE SLEEPING BEAUTY has some very interesting things going on in it and it starts off rather strongly but as the girl&apos;s mission kept going the interest level started to drop. I thought the first thirty-minutes were rather interesting because the story made for something that should have worked much better. I thought the early scenes showing the girl getting ready to set off on this journey was interesting and I thought her first stop, to a new family with an older brother, featured some good stuff. From this point on the film started to lose me and especially when the various stops that the girl goes through. All of these look very good visual and there are some great looking scenes but sadly all of them are rather slow and seem to go nowhere. Carla Besainou plays the 6-yaer-old girl and does a very good job with the part. I thought she was quite charming and managed to carry the performance in a very believable fashion. The supporting players are all nice as well but no one can really save this picture. THE SLEEPING BEAUTY is aimed more at adults with its nudity and thoughts on sexuality but these just aren&apos;t enough to make it worth viewing outside of the director&apos;s fans."

      "reviewBody": "This is often said to be the worst of the Star Trek films. After watching it I can see why a lot of people would think that. It is a very flawed film but I by no means hated it. In fact, I liked it more than Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier opens with the crew of the Enterprise enjoying some well deserved shore leave. Kirk, Spock, and Bones enjoy their time off together by going camping in Yosemite park and this makes for some amusingly cheesy moments. Their vacation is interrupted when they must respond to a hostage situation concerning a renegade Vulcan who happens to be Spock&apos;s half brother. This Vulcan&apos;s name is Sybok and he is on a desperate search for God and the end of the universe. There are also some Klingons in pursuit of Kirk and the Enterprise, but they don&apos;t seem to serve much of a purpose in the end. The Final Frontier is all kinds of weird and doesn&apos;t have much of a structure, but I can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t have fun with this movie.\n\nRemember how The Voyage Home added this element of comedy to Star Trek? Well The Final Frontier saw that and thought to itself, &apos;Hey! I can do that too!&apos; Unfortunately, it was wrong. Any and all comedy in this film is completely unnecessary and either makes you cringe or roll your eyes in embarrassment. There are moments in the film where I was left wondering, &apos;Why in the hell did the writers think that line was a good idea?&apos; The movie tries way too hard with its ridiculous punchlines and awkward moments that are supposed to be hilarious. A lot of the humor comes around when the friendship between Kirk, Spock, and Bones is being developed. This was always an important aspect of Star Trek, but The Final Frontier almost makes a mockery of it. Never, under any circumstances do I need to watch Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley sit around a campfire singing Row Row Row Your Boat. But I guess these were the days when Shatner and Nimoy were building their &quot;singing&quot; careers so they thought they needed those &quot;careers&quot; to carry over into Star Trek.\n\nThis movie had the potential to be incredible. Sybok&apos;s search for God could have gone much deeper and been much more intellectual than what it was. This aspect of the film had spiritual and existential overtones, but they were buried by silly nonsensical scenes that do nothing for the plot. There is a lot to strip away if you want to get down to the more intellectual meaning of this film. It is something that was so obscured by the amount of crap this film throws together that in the end it was a completely lost meaning.\n\nBut if you move past that, The Final Frontier can be pretty fun. If you enjoy it for its cheese than you can have a moderately good time. Especially towards the end, the film becomes completely over-the-top and loaded with cheese. It isn&apos;t like The Motion Picture, which tried way to hard to be something it wasn&apos;t and painfully dragged on for over two hours. The Final Frontier clocks in at only an hour and 45 minutes and just stays lively and fun the whole time. It isn&apos;t high quality fun, but its fun nevertheless. This definitely is not a Star Trek film I would watch again, but its a necessary watch if you are a fan of Star Trek like me and have made it your duty to see all of the films.\n\nStar Trek: The Final Frontier is not a good movie. But its not a bad movie either. It isn&apos;t one of those that I just hated by the end, but I knew for sure that what I had just seen was not a very well made film. I love Star Trek so watching Kirk, Spock, and Bones boldly go where no man has gone before, even if they go to a realm of such cringe worthy cheese as this, still puts a smile on my face.",

      "reviewBody": "I am the big fan of the television short-video series &apos;Minuscule&apos;. I watched all of them like a kid when it was aired in my country on Nickelodeon. Along with me everyone in my family loved it and each of us like different characters. So we all expected this movie from the very beginning when they announced the project. The wait is over, I saw it a couple of days ago and I totally loved it.\n\nIt was the best choice of characters for the movie over plenty of tiny creatures are desperate to debut on the silver screen. They chose ants and ladybugs and their adventures filled with lots of humour. This was the story of a young ladybug who got separated from his parents. He meets a pack of black ants who are on a hunt for food, then they team up and help each other to face the challenge that coming in their way to home. Especially red ants who are on the trail to snatch their finds. This running and chasing between two small groups of creature becomes a crucial war between those races.\n\nIf you are familiar with this TV series, then you will clearly understand the characters and their behaviour. Not much deviated, they kept as much the original except stretched to 90 minutes runtime. The story was largely inspired from &apos;The Lord of the Rings&apos; trilogy. Each section of the story telling reminds different episode of &apos;The Lord of the Rings&apos;. First, it begins with &apos;The Fellows of the Sugar Cubes&apos;, then &apos;The Single Tower&apos; and ends with &apos;The Return of the Queen&apos;. All the way it was so much fun like you had for the TV series.\n\nNo need to worry for the first time watcher, especially who are unfamiliar with these little characters. It was more like another version that you had seen in the Hollywood animations &apos;Antz&apos;, &apos;A Bug Life&apos; &apos;Bee Movie&apos; et cetera. The best part of all of it was this movie was dialogueless. No speaking, no names and no hard-coded subs. It only features amusing sounds created by the bugs and the wonderful background scores. It&apos;s a universal theme and presentation without any language barriers.\n\nA specially made movie for children with fine story. In company of them adults as well can enjoy it equally. One of the best animation movie, in fact the best children&apos;s movie of the year. Hope this title continues with many sequels in which each of the installments should brief different bug&apos;s or insect&apos;s tales. A must show to the kids and must see by the animation movie fans. Have this and have a great time.",

So, after reviewing 10 or 12 titles, I settled on Teresa&apos;s Tattoo partly because of the premise, partly because of actor Lou Diamond Phillips- The Big Hit, Stand and Deliver.\n\nWhat was really interesting was seeing a number of popular actors in this movie that are uncredited as the top billers in the print ads- Joe Pantoliano, Teppi Hedren and more- executing a poorly directed script. This is probably a movie they would like to disassociate themselves.\n\nThe movie, as a whole, was poorly executed as an entertainment vehicle. The script lacked the comedic flow necessary to evoke substantial laughter from this viewer.  There were a few funny moments (particularly the desk sergeant/police officer scene with Teresa/Gloria (Adrienne Shelley)), but most of the scenes fell flat.\n\nRating: 4/10",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll start off by saying the bar was set pretty low for this flick. While I love horror, slasher horror is one of my least favorite types. What made this film for me (along with several other reviewers) is the cinematography. It&apos;s a real visual treat - pretty in parts, gritty and terrifying in parts, with a &quot;we&apos;re stuck in the middle of dry, dead earth&quot; type of despair to it. \n\nI didn&apos;t want to think Amber Heard did a good job. I don&apos;t think the role of Mandy Lane required much but a really beautiful girl (which she is), but her delivery and execution is spot on. Michael Welch held his own and all the supporting kids were believable.\n\nWhen the killings start, it&apos;s pretty obvious who is doing it. The first murder is particularly brutal. The &quot;twist&quot; is not much of a twist, but it&apos;s well executed.\n\nI had a lot of problems with the dialog, but then, I have a lot of problems listening to teenagers talk in real life. So I&apos;m betting the dialog was pretty standard and not as cringe-worthy as I thought. I&apos;m not familiar with the writer (Jacob Forman) and originally decided to watch this movie because I mistakenly thought Jonathan Levine wrote it. He directed it, but I like his writing (The Wackness, Warm Bodies).\n\nCertain parts drag - I get that we need to build that droning, neverending party feeling but I wish there was a way to do that without a droning, neverending party. There is a lot of violence but it&apos;s....muffled. I don&apos;t know how else to describe it. It&apos;s effective because taking the edge out of it makes it seem more real. \n\nIf you like horror movies, you might like this. If you like slasher movies, you will probably like it.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Potop&quot; (&quot;The Deluge&quot;) is the film that every Pole knows almost by heart. It is shown on TV every year, either at Christmas time or at Easter - and yet we watch it over and over again and we are never bored with it. There are many reasons for it, like superb acting by some of the greatest Polish actors, especially by Olbrychski as Kmicic (although I personally don&apos;t like him very much in his other roles, he just WAS Kmicic - passionate, quick-tempered, desperately in love with Olenka and not too politically wise) and the gripping story covering a tragic period in the history of my nation (that is the Swedish &quot;deluge&quot; as we call it - the 17th century war between Poland and Sweden, when Swedish armies invaded our land and some noble families betrayed the Polish king and accepted Gustavus Karolus).\n\nOne of the strongest elements of the film is the care with which the director and the whole crew depicted the 17th century Poland, with the costumes, traditions and food. As an anecdote I can tell you, that at the time the average family saw ham only at Christmas, and never in such amounts as you can see in the film - and yet what you see on the table in the picture is real hams, game and poultry...\n\nThe devotion and passion of all the crew members show in the film - and that is why it involves us, the viewers even after so many years. But the most important thing is that whether you know Polish history or not, you will find in the movie some general truths about war, about how it influences peoples&apos; lives, and how the sacrifice of one man can change the course of history. It will also tell you something about the Poles - yes, we are rebellious, we are quarrelsome, and yet we are ready to die for things that are sacred to us - like the abbey in Czestochowa, the &quot;home&quot; of the national treasure: the painting of Madonna, the Queen of Poland.\n\nSo watch it and enjoy - it&apos;s on my personal list of top 10 films of all times, all nations.",

The story of this weary master thief and a disillusioned (with love)jazz singer meeting,finding common ground and falling &apos;for each other&apos; is age old. However, their common ground is quite unusual and a bit of a stretch (but hey...it&apos;s a story). Where they meet and how the story plays out, is an unexpected and interesting twist. To my mind, the acting and Morrocan setting are great. Jeremy Irons is his usual cool and collected self and the lead actress suits the part beautifully...and can she sing!! The soundtrack, to my mind (and heart) definitely steals the show. - I love blues/jazz and I found this sound track hauntingly, thought provokingly absorbing.",

      "reviewBody": "Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman received a great deal of acclaim for his &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; script, but while that film contained many quirky and inventive ideas, the plot fell apart in the third act, making for an ultimately unsatisfying experience. The same can be said for his second produced script, &quot;Human Nature,&quot; which is chock-full of good ideas but ultimately unravels. Kaufman is clever and a jokester, he&apos;s just not much of a scenarist.\n\nOn the up side, there&apos;s a lovely performance by Patricia Arquette, who&apos;s not afraid of any of the many bizarre turns her character goes through, and director Michel Gondry (who has made terrific videos for Bjork and others) does the best that he can with the script. (Although those CG mice are pretty lame once they are set free.)\n\nNot an unalloyed success, but some elements here definitely work. Too bad they don&apos;t all come through.",

That&apos;s not all there is, but the central idea behind this film&apos;s construction is so brilliant I can&apos;t say any more. The end is such a surprise that you&apos;ll either be blown away or feel ripped off. It plays with story construction in a way I&apos;ve never seen done before, one that&apos;s begging to be copied by some high-profile indie here in the US. Film school buffs will dig it and find a lot to argue about, others might be confused or annoyed. Ray Milland is good but kind of decrepit-looking, here in the evening of his career; the chief culprits in this film are the pop songs that they repeat endlessly (though catchy). I&apos;d love to see reactions to this one; I recommend it highly."

Angus also has a quality to it that was very reminiscent of the story it was based on. the exchanges between Angus and Troy were literally the best i&apos;ve ever seen. they are truly the original dynamic duo of disaster. with luck, other characters hoping to achieve that particular brand of fame will be measured against them for years to come. ps: read the short story if you haven&apos;t. pps: james van der beek gave a great (though small) performance, very uncharacteristic of &quot;the kid&apos;s movie villain&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "The film focuses the epic David-life (1010-970 B.C.) , retelling his complicated family relationship (rebellion his son Absalom ) and generally tackling the intricacies of his love story with Bathsheba . He&apos;s a very human figure who is recorded in the Bible (Samuel, Books 1 and 2), conqueror Jerusalen and author of the Psalms . It tells from the prophet Samuel (Raymond Massey) appointed him , when after in his kingdom Saul (Francis X Bushman) and his son Jonathan were vanquished by Philistines . When Saul was murdered by a blade slashed himself, David (Peck) claimed his reign by right of his marriage to Saul&apos;s daughter(Jane Meadows) . The continued threat and domination of invaders countries forced the Jewish tribes uniting under a strong king : David. He&apos;s specially recorded for his acquisition of his favorite spouse , Bathsheba (Susan Hayward), though he had a harem , too . The new wife was accomplished by sending her husband named Uria (Kieron Moore) the Hitita , a warrior serving as mercenary, into way in war. His throne was marred by the habitual dynastic fights between his sons , Absalom (Barnett) killed Ammon and after rebelled and was murdered . There are also developed various events about David-life , such as the arrival in Jerusalen the Ark of the Covenant with supernatural qualities ; David playing harp , in fact , David had entered Saul&apos;s household as a sort of musical therapist , the Hebrew politics intrigues and pitting against the Old Testament wrath of the Prophet Nathan and , of course , David- Goliath fighting is seen in flashback , defeating with a throwing wave a ten-foot-tall Philistine giant . Later rebellion Absalon and killing Ammon , succeeded Salomon , son of Bathseba , he inherited the reign at David&apos;death and became himself a major king of Israel , building the famous temple of Salomon where held the Ark . David and Salomon were the two great kings of Israel.\n\nInteresting Biblical story with emotion , rousing battles , an intense drama about love and hatred , being some moments proceeded in slow moving pace . And including the legendary biblical fight between David and Goliath is well featured in the movie by means of flashbacks . The film&apos;s story from the Bible was based upon its books of Samuel I and II, Chronicles I and the Psalms of David . Very good acting by main cast , Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward ; Peck stated that the movie was written as an attack on McCarthyism, which he strongly opposed . This Biblical epic contains good set decoration and art direction (Thomas Little , Lyle Weeler, George Davis) but is a little boring and dull with long speeches that it makes stately pace , especially when David is praying in the Tabernacle where is the Ark of Covenant . The movie gets a colorful cinematography and evocative music score by the classic Alfred Newman . The motion picture was professionally directed by Henry King. His direction is well crafted , here he develops a thought-provoking and broody screenplay . He was a expert on compelling Adventure/Western genre . Henry King directed classic Western as ¨ Jesse James(1939)¨, ¨The gunfighter(1950)¨ and ¨The Bravados¨¨ (1958) with Peck again . Koster was specialist on Adventure genre as proved in ¨Untamed¨ , ¨Captain King¨ , ¨Captain of Castilla¨ , ¨Black Swan¨ , ¨Stanley and Livingstone¨ ¨and many others .\n\nOther films about this Biblical king are the following : ¨David and Goliat¨ (1961) by Ferdinando Baldi with Orson Welles as King Saul , Ivo Payer as David and Edward Hilton as Prophet Samuel ; ¨A Story of David¨ (1961) with Jeff Chandler , Basil Sidney and Donald Pleasence , ¨King David¨ (1985) by Bruce Beresford with Richard Gere , Alice Krige , Dennis Quilley , Jean Marc Bar and Edward Woodward . And ¨The Story of David¨ (1976) (TV) by David Lowell Rich with Timothy Bottoms , Anthony Quayle , ¨David¨ (1997) TV by Robert Markowitz with Nathaniel Parker as David , Jonathan Pryce as Saul , Leonard Nimoy as Samuel , Sheryl Lee as Bathsheba and Ben Daniels as Jonathan",

      "reviewBody": "Just got back from the theater--walked in the door and turned on the computer--and am in agony! I was really excited about this movie and looking forward to seeing it ever since the previews came out. But, boy!, was I disappointed. All of the cute stuff (and pretty much the only cute stuff) was contained in those previews.\n\nThere is nothing original, and nothing funny enough or well-acted enough to make its unoriginality interesting. Jennifer Aniston did a decent job, given what she had to work with (though she does act like she does in most of her other movies). But the writing wasn&apos;t good, and the plot was weak and all over the place. Most everything you see, you&apos;ve seen before--just done better somewhere else--and all of it combined into something very hodgepodge. It&apos;s like the storywriters just took a &quot;pinch of this&quot; and a &quot;dash of that&quot; from various comedies, romances, and action adventures, and tried to make a soup out of them.\n\nThe music was so bad I&apos;m even giving it its own paragraph. I had no idea the music would make such a difference, normally I don&apos;t notice it&apos;s even there. Not so on this one! It was often agonizingly out of place, where you had to wonder what the score writers were thinking, or why they picked the song they did.\n\nI left twice for the concession stand, and didn&apos;t even care to ask what had happened while I was gone. There were times I found that I was even having to remind myself to pay attention to the dialogue. As I don&apos;t go to the theater often, it&apos;s usually a treat to me, and most of the time I enjoy whatever I&apos;m watching simply because it&apos;s relaxing and a chance to be out. But for once I was actually bored. It was about the quality of a TV show, but unfortunately lasted the length of a full movie.\n\nThe romantic/action with husband and wife fighting-yet-finding-they-might-still-love-each-other plot has been done before much better. &quot;Mr and Mrs Smith&quot; was GOOD. &quot;Fool&apos;s Gold&quot; was decent. &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; was just downright poor. So disappointing!",

      "reviewBody": "I have been very fond of this movie for years, particularly as compared with Fox&apos;s bloated monstrosity of 1963. Colbert is admittedly somewhat miscast (her face is altogether Parisienne), but she handles the part with considerable charm. Warren William, usually a very limited actor, is as good a Caesar as I have seen on film, commanding and uncomfortable by turns; while Henry Wilcoxon is the definitive Mark Antony, laughing, brawling, swaggering, crude and brooding. C. Aubrey Smith as Enobarbus, the last of the hardcore Roman republicans, is perfect. Victor Milner&apos;s cinematography is superb, if old-fashioned. There is one magnificent pullback shot aboard Cleopatra&apos;s barge, with more and more stuff entering the frame, which as pure cinema is worth more than all four hours of the Liz Taylor version for my money. Shakespeare and Shaw have both been drawn upon here and there, and the movie has generally good (and fun) dialogue, not always one of DeMille&apos;s strengths. Consider also the scene of Cleopatra&apos;s entrance into Rome: contrary to DeMille&apos;s usual reputation, this scene is underplayed, depicting a plausible parade through a very real Roman street with authentic trappings, compared to the outrageously bogus and overblown spectacle given us in 1963.  A word is also in order for the music of Rudolph Kopp, an extremely obscure Hollywood composer, who turns in an atmospheric score redolant of the old silent movies. This style is easy to make fun of, but see how effective it is in the highly theatrical opening credits! DeMille used silent film technique well into the talkie era, particularly in crowd scenes, and it still works. The battle scenes are the weakest point, since evidently Paramount ran out of cash and C.B. had to make do with a bunch of short shots put together with Russian cutting; nevertheless, this is still as good a picture on the subject as has yet been made, a bit of extravagant old Hollywood at its most polished."

And Anurag did it again by just being a produce. Its like &quot;the MIDAS touch&quot;. \n\nFirst, i was never going to watch this movie, but just gave a shot coz i am a huge fan of Anurag Kashyap. And.. taddaa ! I was not disappointed, even though the director is Bijoy Nambiar. \n\nAbout Direction - Nambiar has his own style, can say the Guy Ritchie of Bollywood. Super slow motion, more involvement of camera as a character, fast paced flash backs, witty narration and good background music. \n\nAbout actors - Really believable.. &apos;that&apos;s what is required in a movie&apos;. Most of the lead actors were new ,but were well seasoned campaigners from the TV channels. Rajiv Khandelwal&apos;s role was very impact full, so was all the support actors. \n\nAbout Music - Perfect ! just fitted the movie. It was just a character of the movie. Am really upset and wondering that ... y the songs.. &quot;Khoya khoya chand and Hawa hawai&quot; is not there in the OST? :(\n\nAbout the Movie - Its the best Bollywood has to offer after &quot;3 Idiots&quot;. Its... stylish, has good action, acting, music and its a zero VFX movie. The whole movie is real in its look (the roads, buildings, character, story). We can relate it to our own daily life routine. That&apos;s where the movie scores its mark. And above the all.. you can OR just watch this movie in theater... simply superb ! for its action, music, run chase, super slow mo scenes.\n\nAaah !

Still, since I&apos;m such a huge fan of Stoppard&apos;s play, I figured that I&apos;d give it a chance. Hell, I&apos;ve watched more Troma movies than anyone I know, so it&apos;s not like I have any right to say that I have standards.\n\nI steeled myself for lame theater puns and ironic references to the Stoppard play, but I was actually quite surprised. Yes, there are lame theater puns and a couple references to the Stoppard play, but this is more properly a parody of Hamlet and Dracula. Depending on your tolerance for unsophisticated humor, you may even find it funny. It&apos;s not really all that witty or intelligent, but it&apos;s stupid and wacky enough to be mildly amusing, much like Troma movies.\n\n6/10 might be a bit generous, but, for those us out there who are very easily amused, I think you could do worse.",

      "reviewBody": "...alongside La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and Amarcord. Fellini&apos;s films are not for everybody perhaps, but I admire them how well made made and directed they are, some of them like Amarcord and the peacock in the snow have breathtakingly beautiful images that stay long in the mind, for his choices in composers and actors, for his deliberately paced and sometimes ambitious stories(8 1/2 is especially true of this) and also that the characters are not always what they seem at first glance. Nights of Cabiria I have seen before criticised as grating, sentimental and self-indulgent(the latter being a criticism of Fellini&apos;s films in general and him also actually), and while I am understanding, I personally don&apos;t agree.\n\nI find Nights of Cabiria to be one of his accessible films, and along with La Strada also his most moving. Again it is incredibly well made, with beautiful scenery and cinematography. The images are again very memorable, and done with much emotional resonance, the best of which being the ending which is both tragic and uplifting. Fellini&apos;s direction is superb, the personal nostalgia that is apparent in all his films is here and you do identify with the story and the titular character. The music has much beauty and nostalgic charm, while the story perfectly tells of the sheer happiness and then tearful sorrow of unfortunate Cabiria&apos;s life. Cabiria, the titular character, is one you can identify with immediately, feeling pity and also her conflicting emotions as she tries to remain positive even in the face of adversity. Giulietta Masina gives a bravura performance, her face and eyes are beautifully expressive and she is just heart-breaking. Francois Perier also shines as the stranger who makes the offer that is almost too good to be true.\n\nOverall, a truly beautiful film and one of Fellini&apos;s best, certainly one of my favourites as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

In one of the interviews he said that this movie is his 2nd best movie made.\n\nWe come to see Gemini Ganesan after a long gap, and the performance of all the characters are top notch.\n\nIn all KB movies even a peck may have a role to play. I was deeply moved by the COOK&apos;s character. The movie deals with a protagonist who is a maverick and doesn&apos;t want to follow the same stupid things which even his dad is following now. The concept of inter caste marriage, abolition of Liquor shops etc are very well etched in the movie.\n\nThe humor aspect and the Background score are excellent.\n\nA must watch movie.",

And if you&apos;re not a fan of Daft Punk you aren&apos;t automatically going to dislike it. No music by Daft Punk. No dialog or flashing helmet text. Ambient sound. And Curtis Mayfield.\n\nElectroma plays like a festival art film, yet it&apos;s more accessible to the audience than the &quot;Cremaster&quot; movies and more thoughtful and varied than &quot;Zidane&quot;. In essence, the movie comprises five set pieces. It opens with a drive through the desert, then a town. The second set involves becoming human. They then re-enter the robot world in a Frankenstein-esquire reversal, playing off of Icarus. The fourth part brings the sad realization of returning to robotic roots. Fifth, they walk through a desert, which comprises the longest part of the film.\n\nI recommend it for the art-house/festival crowd. No dialog, an atypical plot-line, and lengthy sweeping pans will certainly turn away some fans. It is pretentious to a degree, I won&apos;t deny it, but compared to Cremaster (an unfair comparison, yes, but it&apos;s the most widely seen), Electroma doesn&apos;t require pre-emptive knowledge for the deciphering of the symbols, which tells you what you&apos;re watching. You can absorb it without extreme cerebral input.\n\nIt&apos;s slow. Like Tarkovsky or Herzog. Don&apos;t expect hyperactive techno robots.\n\nYou&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find this film, as Daft Punk does not intend to ever release this film on DVD. See it at a festival or snag a bootleg. It&apos;s worth the time."

If you expect the usual revenge story you are wrong, though. The killing native is nothing more than a running gag in a family drama where the father(one of the killers) wants his half-breed daughter to marry a wealthy men but she loves Ringo and wants to be together with him. Acting is OK and the story has a certain depth but overall the film makes a cheap and amateurish impression. Art direction is severely lacking and cinematography isn&apos;t satisfying, either. Hardly recommended for fans of Italian cinema, Western fans better look elsewhere for pleasure.\n\n3 / 10.",

      "reviewBody": "When Howard Hawks released his classic screwball comedy, &apos;His Girl Friday,&apos; in 1940, it was a pretty safe bet that the film would forever remain the definitive cinematic version of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur&apos;s hit Broadway comedy of 1928. It takes a truly talented director to successfully remake a classic, and, indeed, talent is a quality that Billy Wilder has in great abundance, as he proved time and time again throughout a prolific career. Jack Lemmon stars as Hildebrand &quot;Hildy&quot; Johnson, an ace reporter with the Chicago Examiner newspaper in 1929, who decides to resign and get married on the eve of a major execution. Walter Matthau also stars as Walter Burns, the cunning, scheming newspaper boss who cannot afford to allow Hildy to quit the business at any cost. The two actors make an absolute dream partnership, and, as always, work incredibly well together {they had previously shared the screen in &apos;The Fortune Cookie (1966)&apos; and &apos;The Odd Couple (1968),&apos; and would do so on many more subsequent occasions}.\n\nIn the crowded press room of a Chicago jail, a cluster of rival newspaper reporters clamour about for the perfect exclusive story, centred around the execution of a convicted cop-killer, Earl Williams (Austin Pendleton). In their desperate bid to write a great article, these inherently dishonest journalists will even occasionally fabricate their own news stories, but this strategy turns out to be rather unnecessary on this night. As Hildy arrives at the jail to farewell his comrades, determined to ignore the shrewd obstacles of his ex-employer, the story of a lifetime falls directly into his lap, and now it will take ever ounce of his willpower to resist the urge to report and to start a new life in advertising. While the two leads are, of course, terrific, enjoyable supporting performances are given by Pendleton as the prisoner awaiting execution, Vincent Gardenia as the bumbling sheriff and Susan Sarandon as Hildy&apos;s would-be future wife.\n\nThough &apos;The Front Page (1974)&apos; {the third adaptation of the play} doesn&apos;t cover any different ground than &apos;His Girl Friday&apos; did {with the exception of reverting Hildy back to a male character}, it is the quality of the script, the chemistry between the leads and the selection of quirky supporting characters that make this an essential complementary viewing experience for fans of Hawks&apos; film. Watching this one made me remember just how much I had enjoyed &apos;His Girl Friday;&apos; the story is a classic write-up of eccentric situations and quick-fire verbal clashes, and both movies exploit this to its full potential. I wouldn&apos;t go as far as saying that &apos;The Front Page&apos; is a superior comedy, but it is a worthy effort, and Wilder fans could not possibly be disappointed. The screenplay was penned by Wilder and regular co-contributer I.A.L. Diamond, and is packed with an excellent selection of quotable one-liner insults. I also loved the sly reference to the Saint Valentine&apos;s Day Massacre, at which, of course, Jack Lemmon was present in &apos;Some Like it Hot (1959).&apos;",

      "reviewBody": "What does being a Jew mean nowadays? Emanuel Goldfarb, a Jewish journalist, is asked by the Director of a Jewish community in Germany, to respond to an invitation by a professor to tell his pupils about his life as a Jew living in Germany. This conversation, performed by Goldfarb and the Director of the community, is the only scene of Oliver Hirschbiegel&apos;s film « Ein ganz gewohnlicher Jude » presented at the Film and Television Festival of Genève, which was shot outdoors and it&apos;s the only moment where something apparently happens. \n\nHowever, this is when the word reigns supreme. Emanuel Goldfarb is alone in his apartment and on his dictaphone he expresses his rage about the feeling of violation in one&apos;s private life. He attempts to write a sarcastic letter to the professor after being immersed in the memories of his childhood and talks about how the others see you, the « pity » which is far too often discovered, about the rational and irrational relationship between Jewish traditions. He talks about his family, destroyed by Nazist barbarism and finally decides to write and transform his thoughts in an emotional existential analysis that will lead him to return to the class and meet the professor and his pupils. Masterfully interpreted by Ben Becker, the protagonist offers us a brilliant monologue  adapted by Charles Lewinsky&apos;s novel  a reflexion representing the cultural anchorage of the Jewish religion in Germany thus providing us with some true paths of understanding. \n\nMariano Morace (Lugano, Switzerland) translated by Rosanna Branch (Lugano, Switzerland)",
